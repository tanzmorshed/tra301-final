"danube83","10","1041","1286","13 July 2008"," Neeson is the vodka of James Bond's martini
","The most thrilling movie I've seen in a long time. Neeson is what we would fear if James Bond went to hell and came back for revenge (I doubt big budget Quantum of Solace will top this). I loved Jason Bourne; but where Bourne is confused for half the movie, Neeson is looking down a barrel of a pistol 3/4 of the time. In a three way spy battle, I would put Neeson edging out Bourne, who would be a step ahead of Bond.<br/><br/>Between the jaw-dropping action sequences was the subject matter of international trafficking, which was pretty miserable to watch. Although killing is wrong, death was never more satisfying to watch."
"talanish","9","769","946","26 April 2008"," Probably the fastest 93 minutes of my life !
","Wow - I had already read reviews of this movie, and with the writer being one of my favourite directors, Luc Besson, I just had to go see this movie as soon as possible...<br/><br/>I was not disappointed... I'm not sure if this was intentional but there were no trailers before the movie, so being thrown strait into the film unexpectedly with people whispering ""is this it then ?"" only helping build up some initial tension and excitement.<br/><br/>The film starts nicely, but with overtones of spy thrillers like ""Day of the Jackal"" coming to mind. Neeson seems a bit pityful at the start, but soon overturns that impression with a taste of his handywork after around ten minutes of the thriller.<br/><br/>Then, before you know it, it's over. 93 minutes, gone in a blur of fighting, fear, chasing and excitement at serious pace. The artwork and direction is nicely done, giving you the feeling of being the one attacking and the chair squirming feeling of being the poor gits who get annihilated in almost every way possible.<br/><br/>It was one of those films that I wanted to applause after the film, I actually clapped about three times, but no-one joined in... too afraid of being the only two people clapping I suppose...<br/><br/>Neeson was great, and I can't wait to see the movie many more times. I only gave it 9 out of 10, as it was too short ! The film could have been easily stretched to 2 hours in my opinion, with some more development and intimacy with the characters. But I guess this may have not made it so exciting... still, well worth the money to see this in the big screen."
"mitrismaster","8","376","485","13 July 2008"," brilliantly executed film
","First thing to say is, this is a great and fun movie from beginning to end. If you like the Bourne titles then you will love this movie. The fighting style and the way things get done is similar to Matt Damon's character and it doesn't get old and is interesting and great to watch throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>The movie has a similar plot to other action thrillers, but even though you may know the outcome, it is the journey that counts in this movie. It is the way he does what he does, the way that he fights and overcomes problems that draws you into the movie and makes this movie so great to watch.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is such a great cast for the main character, he delivers an outstanding performance. I love to see an actor that can portray themself in anyway, a good guy or a bad guy and in this film he fights for his daughter and he will not stop for anything. You love to watch him seek revenge and feel for him the whole time, maybe just because its Liam Neeson, can you help yourself from loving this guy? He is such a great actor and shows himself as a badass with charm. <br/><br/>Great, great , greatness i loved this movie so much and had great fun watching it. If you love the bourne titles you must see this movie. All i can say is its so much fun to watch it, love it and go check it out."
"sc_dude","9","355","458","21 April 2008"," perfect high speed action
","Just saw the movie in the sneak preview. First of all this movie will get a lot of those people who will whine about everything that is not realistic really (If you are one of those, you'll have a lot to whine about). But if you can just enjoy a movie as its intended to be and you appreciate some action this movie is near perfect. The main character is so pure and non complex. Finally an action movie that doesn't try to give some oddities to the characters to make them more interesting but just straightforward high speed action .<br/><br/>Watching this movie was a great experience and I was surprised that I could enjoy an action movie this much. My tip: sit down, enjoy the ride and don't moan about imperfections."
"StevinTasker","9","251","331","9 January 2009"," It doesn't get much better.
","A no nonsense, kick the crap out of everyone who gets in your way action movie. Liam Neeson's character is the angry love child of Bourne,Bond and all the other pretenders put together. If I was asked to cast the movie I guess he wouldn't have been my first choice but having seen it I can't think of anyone else I'd rather have in the role. The fight choreography is bone crunchingly good. This is one kick ass flick and one I will definitely buy on DVD. There's little doubt who the bad guys are and they get a very satisfactory smack in the mouth - when they aren't being shot or electrocuted. This was made by people who like the genre and know how to get an action movie from A to Z. I can't help but giggle at those reviews that mention plot and probability in this kind of movie. What kind of movie did they think they were going to see?"
"peggeltje99","8","466","642","13 March 2008"," Surprising original exciting action movie
","I saw this movie tonight at the sneak preview and I was completely surprised and blown away. I went to see this movie with no expectations. In the beginning it seems that it was going to be an easy to watch movie, but after a short time it turned into a high-speed action movie. I found the story original and so did my friends. At some times I found it hard to watch, because of the drug abuse and violence. To know that these practices still occur also gave me a horrible feeling. I was completely taken away by this movie. At some points it was very very quiet in the cinema, because of the excitement, you wonder what is going to happen next. Some moments in the story I found a bit not convincing, but the rest of the movie makes up to that. Liam Neeson in one of his best performances. It had good action, a good story, some humor. There are also some sensitive / sentimental scenes. There are no plot twists. It is just a story being told. This is one of those movies which stay in your memory for a while and let you think about bad things that happen. The movie that had that same effect on me was Traffic (2000). Personally I think this movie is underrated, but maybe this is because it is new. I would give it 8/10."
"vlad-cocoru","10","592","832","30 May 2008"," Surprinsingly good - definitely must see
","I'm still under the influence of this movie, so my comment is likely to be superlative! I went to this movie, knowing that one of the writers and the director were both French, and since I've seen some not-so-impressive movies (almost fell asleep), i was really skeptical.<br/><br/>BUT this one proved to be a great action movie. The best movie to compare with Taken is Hit-man. The idea is somewhat the same (lots of action, shots, flying bullets etc) - though the motive for the actions are not money. But the level of realism, the motivation of the character, the cold blood which moves him on makes this flick a good option to choose when selecting a movie.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson does a great performance, perfectly interpreting his role of a former spy. As he says in one of his lines, he's ""retired, but not dead"", having an opportunity to show everyone what he knows to do best.<br/><br/>The movie covers a hot topic too, kidnapping young women to force them to prostitute, and all the business this involves. You get to see the kind of people are supporting these arrangements and what it takes for the victims to be there.<br/><br/>Of course, the movie has (very small, almost invisible) drawbacks, like some lines in a wrong language (english instead of french) and some Rambo - stuff, but the overall impression is simple: a strong recommendation!"
"happyendingrocks","8","32","41","24 June 2009"," Who needs luck when you can break a guy's arm in three places?
","Since the entire plot of this film is given away in the masterfully delivered trailer, it's not divulging anything to say that Taken is a modern-day revenge thriller. This presents an interesting experiment, actually. Considering that there aren't really any surprises to be found in Taken, beyond those we were offered in the pre-release snippet, are splendidly realized action sequences enough to carry this film? The answer here is a resounding ""yes"". Taken may be a simple film, but it's not simplistic, and even though the first third of it is spent recapping what we knew going in, the second and third acts here deliver enough thrills and action to make this film riveting, even if we know exactly where it's going.<br/><br/>By setting the chase within the ultra-sleazy world of human trafficking, which we secretly hope is just a media creation, but know deep inside that this reprehensible and inhumane phenomenon is a reality, the film is propelled by a sense of urgency that isn't present in most revenge films. Liam Neeson's daughter isn't ""Dead"", she's ""Taken"", so his race against the ticking stopwatch tracking her probable fate provides enough tension to diffuse any disappointment in knowing exactly what's going to happen here.<br/><br/>The selling point here is how deftly Liam Neeson hacks his way through a bevy of Albanian baddies. Neeson is untested as an action star, but watching him maneuver his way through the sea of detritus here, we're left hoping that he's got a franchise in him.<br/><br/>The film may not have the intricacies of the expertly crafted Bourne films (although, like every action film made since Bourne appeared on the screen, the fight scenes here owe an obviously rich debt to Matt Damon's antics), but the gritty and realistic path Neeson carves to get to his stolen daughter is sufficient to deliver the promise implied by the fantastic trailer.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a parent to understand and sympathize with Liam's plight here, and there is a morbid but exhilarating sense of release in seeing the evil empire pay for its transgressions. Sometimes morally complex, ambiguous studies of man's desire for revenge are too preachy to be entertaining. Taken doesn't really care if you like Liam Neeson or wonder if he's doing the right thing by flagrantly taking the law into his own hands; the film just wants you to strap yourself in and enjoy the tidings as he hands out beat-downs all over Paris.<br/><br/>This film doesn't want you to think. Like Neeson's character quickly realizes, thinking is often not a luxury present in dire circumstances like these. Action is what counts, and for those who miss the era of the lean, mean 85-minute skull-crack fest, Taken will re-conjure the giddy thrills of watching Dudikoff, Seagal, and Van-Damme chomp through a slew of B-Movie terrorists. Having an Oscar-caliber actor delivering the judo chops only sweetens the pot.<br/><br/>Forget about Oscars, plot points, or coherence. This dude's daughter has been kidnapped, and he's a former government agent trained to make bad guys' lives a living hell. Do you want to see him find his daughter and take down the scum who took her? Of course you do. Even reading this review is over-analyzing it."
"l_dura_lex_sed_lex_l","10","307","466","27 February 2008"," A thrilling movie and Neeson at his best !
","Gone to see Liam Neeson, I've just seen a great movie. Much action, some American humour (you Americans don't take it too serious, and that's just as pleasant taht way !), a Liam Neeson at the top of his art and as a background a very hard subject that makes you think about it (procuring). I don't know how the critics are reacting in USA, but in France they are vilifying this movie. So, whatever your American critics are saying, just do as usual : don't listen to them ! And enjoy this ninety-minutes show. Regarding Liam Neeson... Well, I am a huge fan, thus I can't be unbiased. Yet, I found his interpretation very convincing, he is still the same : one of the best actors ever, along with... Hum, I'll stop there, don't want to be controversial. Have a good sitting ! By the way, do excuse me for any mistake I could've made, as I'm French (I imagine you could've guessed it, since we are the lucky ones who are the first to be able to see this film !)."
"wuzzadaly","8","163","252","12 April 2008"," very good popcorn flick, could've been even better
","I went with very few expectations, despite being a fan of Neeson and Besson. I came out pleasantly surprised. The film is very much in the Bourne trilogy mold - Neeson's character is a been-there-seen-it-all former CIA agent who knows all the tricks and is also a dab hand at dispatching henchmen quickly and effectively.<br/><br/>Another reviewer (while giving the movie 1/10) noted all the clichés in the movie. That is true, pretty much everyone is a composite of previous action movie stock characters. The acting is pretty wooden at times, and Neeson's American accent (as usual) doesn't overly impress.<br/><br/>I say above ""could've been even better"" and sadly it does seem like this was an opportunity missed to make a movie that would challenge Bourne. Sadly it falls short there. The action is excellent, Neeson is a very believable tough guy, though the audience I watched it with laughed towards the end when his character takes on almost-superhuman powers.<br/><br/>The film offers a very brief glimpse into the world of sex traffickers but you get the sense that Neeson's character doesn't care about any of these women except his daughter. I think in the end that saves the movie - Neeson doesn't try to save the world, he only wants to save one person and will do pretty much anything to achieve that.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, but don't expect any daring social commentary, just sit back and enjoy, while wondering why Liam Neeson has never tried his hand at any role of this sort before."
"mark-fullam","7","187","298","25 July 2008"," Excellent film, much like Man on Fire
","Just watched this film and have to say, very good in the scheme of things. The film is quite slow at the beginning as others have said, however it quickly gathers pace. The way the script introduces you to the characters is excellent and its only when you see Liam Neeson tackling a crazed fan that you think he is an excellent choice in the lead role, in fact he carries it off very well. I wasn't too sure on Holly Valance as the pop singer, but as the number of scenes she is in are fairly minimal its OK. Action sequences are very well shot and you can tell Luc Besson had his hand in this. To this end, the overall film has an excellent pace which keeps you very well entertained. It has the same sort of storyline as Man on Fire so if you liked that film, then you will definitely like this. I would say its probably slightly better with the direction and cinematography being just a bit classier. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend you seeing this. 7/8 out of 10"
"Jose Guilherme","8","304","495","23 October 2008"," Step aside Bond and Bourne... Niam is better !
","Yes, its only an action movie; Yes, the script has more holes than the victims of the main character! Yes, Neeson's rampage in Paris is very implausible; Yes, its not Oscar material... no great acting.<br/><br/>Still... its a very good movie. I gave it a solid 8. I left the movie feel very satisfied... its that kind of movie that is fun and thrilling and brainless at the same time. Doesn't get tiresome. When its outrageous its funny... when the action gets going you feel right in it all.<br/><br/>When you finish seeing the movie you do wonder why Bond and Bourne aren't as macho or mean. Niam's character Bryan(""B"" letter too) beats up baddies way better and he looks more scary and real somehow than those other pansy agents."
"alipardiwala","9","19","25","14 April 2009"," Never Boring, Always Exciting
","This movie had me excited from since I had read reviews on IMDb about it, and it did not disappoint. This is a fast paced thriller that had me gripped till the end, with great elements of action, a bit of gore, a lot of suspense, and all in all a fun movie that was completely worth the 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson once again proves himself to be up there among the best with another brilliant performance and this one has really made me a big fan of his work, especially after great performances recently in Batman Begins, and voice roles in Narnia and Fallout 3. All through the movie he gives you the impression that he is not one to be messed with, and makes the action sequences look absolutely fantastic. The next Bond? Although a bit old, he would fit into the role brilliantly seeing as how easily he carried it through in Taken.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie, and one I'd recommend to anyone who loves a good action thriller... Nine out of Ten"
"ntsci","Null","51","76","2 June 2009"," Daddy knows best and France is dangerous
","This silly but very violent bit of non-sense could be summed up neatly as daddy knows best and France is dangerous. Not much else to the story.<br/><br/>Basically a girl from a well off background gets trapped into the sex slavery market through kidnapping and drugs, while visiting Paris.<br/><br/>The Daddy is some sort of superman super spy who now works as a body guard. He knows all about the world and was immediately worried when his daughter set off to spend some time in Europe with a friend. He knows how dangerous the world is and of course, in the traditional Daddy knows best theme... it turns out that France IS a dangerous country. So, then daddy turns into superman secret agent and kicks butt all over Europe.<br/><br/>If you don't mind pointless violence, like French bashing, the obligatory Arabic sounding bad guys, or if you think that outrage over a daughters abduction justifies torture, murder and other atrocities (shoting some French cop's wife) than, well, perhaps this is your film.<br/><br/>Personally I vacillated between laughing at the stupidity of the premise, thrilled at the display of martial arts, and at the same time disgusted over the film's violence.<br/><br/>Regarding the stupidity of the premise, I should explain that there is a terrible irony in the depiction of Europe as dangerous when the murder rate is 3.6 times higher in the US than in France. In addition, sexual slavery often involves importing 3rd world women into the US (and into France for that matter); not kidnapping well off US kids in France."
"kvishal-u","9","14","18","21 October 2012"," great movie, keeps you on edge of the seat!!
","I absolutely love these kind of movies. Taken is awesome when it comes to how fast the story moves and leaves the viewer thinking what next. The scenes are well shot, the movie is absorbing and acting simply superb, to the point and no nonsense. Liam Neeson does justice to his role as a retired CIA agent trying to get his daughter back. By the time the movie finished I wanted more and thankfully we now have Taken 2 coming, just hoping its as good as the original one.<br/><br/>It appears that story has been written keeping Neeson in mind because he fits the role in a very natural way. All in all, great movie and if you are into action thrillers then this is the movie for you, and if not then go and watch this, maybe you will become a thriller buff."
"dvc5159","7","7","8","21 December 2008"," ""I will find you... and I will kill you"".
","With these words, ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills has exactly 96 hours to set out and look for his daughter's kidnappers in Paris before she is lost in the sex/slave trade. That's it. No subplots, no cheap thrills, nothing. Even the film's length shows the simplicity of that purpose. 94 minutes. But...<br/><br/>William Friedkin said it best when making the hunted; ""today's action movies are too long (winded) and overblown."" Sure, there are long action movies that are still enjoyable; all 4 ""Die Hard""s, ""True Lies"", ""Speed"", ""Face/Off"", and then there are some which are dumb fun but somewhat incoherent altogether; the last two ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies, ""xXx"" and most Michael Bay films show this. Not here. It's short, fast and definitely exciting.<br/><br/>A realistic knuckle-bound, no-holds-barred thriller, Taken has the ingredients that make a great action movie, added with some ""zing"" to make it better. That ""zing"" is Liam Neeson. His character, Mills is a flawed person. A lonely man with a dark past. His wife left him for another, seemingly better man, because he could not leave his job. His only daughter seems to be the only thing that shows his true human qualities. But take that life-saving angel of his and he will unleash a hell-storm upon those who took her. No, really. It's all about characterization. Neeson is transformed from concerned parent to angel of death within a flash. He would shoot, punch, kick, snap, kill anyone within his rescue path, and yet, possess some humane qualities that make him believable. It's great, because Neeson shows us that he can be an action hero that everybody can cheer on and be afraid of at the same time. I wonder what would Neeson's career would be now if he had taken that action hero path. Don't get me wrong, Neeson is still an exceptionally brilliant actor, but here he shows he can kick ass, hard, and still be up and out, thirsty for more. Mills give Jason Bourne, The Transporter, and 007 a run for their money.<br/><br/>Now the story (by action great Luc Besson and partner Robert Mark Kamen) is simple, but it is refreshingly written well and quite original. It's clear these guys did their research. The first 20 minutes is slow-paced, explaining in detail Neeson's characterization, as well as building up the tension and expectations. However by then the pace will skyrocket, and you will find yourself immersed in this speeding bullet of an actionier. Also it is straightforward and simple, but that's how I (and presumably most action fans) like our action movies nowadays. No confusing plot twists. No cheap thrills. No third person life-savers. And although there are some flaws, it's mostly because they're predictable and clichéd. But that only occurs very few times in the film. It's literally in-your-face action. The dialog is also well written, especially some lines (as exampled by the title comment) said by Neeson himself, in a cold and brutal manner. All I can say is the simple ""child-gets-kidnapped"" plot device is slightly reinvented and done with justice here, ala the ""out-for-revenge"" plot device used in ""Man on Fire"", another excellent action movie.<br/><br/>It's clear that almost everyone involved in the technical aspects of the film is French, and seeing that the film is mostly set in Paris, comes to no surprise. The direction by Pierre Morel is very lively and kinetic, increasing the pace as the film progresses until the climax. He shows a knack for directing action sequences - and there are plenty in this movie. Brutal fights, shootouts, car chases and hand-to-hand combat are put to well use here - in fact this may be THE hardest PG-13 action film ever made. Morel is a guy to look out for in the future. The scenery is photographed by fellow cinematographer Michel Abramowicz, who clearly knows his background as we see the lively and glamorous streets of Paris disguising the gritty urban atmosphere of the underworld. It's really neat and fits the mood of the film well. Accompanying these is slick editing by Frédéric Thoraval, and really neat music by Nathaniel Mechaly, whose score can compete with John Powell's score for the ""Bourne"" trilogy - fast and kinetic during action scenes, slow and reflective during dramatic scenes. Puts you in the mood. Closing off this expanded review, the supporting actors. Don't have nothing much to say as Neeson alone has your total attention. However some credit goes to Maggie Grace as the daughter, convincing us she's not exactly the typical damsel-in-distress.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Taken"" is not just solid, it's SUPER solid. It's excellent. Not only one of the best films of the year, it's also one of the best action movies ever made! A joyously refreshing film to watch, especially if you're an action fan, make this a must-see on your list. It's freaking brilliant and will linger in your mind for some time.<br/><br/>Entertainment value: 10/10<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10"
"tr91","10","14","19","5 August 2013"," Great film!
","I hadn't heard much about this film but it was on TV one day and I decided to watch it. I have now seen this film about 5 times and it is one of my favourites.<br/><br/>It is full of non-stop action, shooting, fighting, car chases, you name it, this film has it. A 90 minute thrill ride. So gripping, leaving you speechless at how good the action on screen is.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is brilliant, he was born to play the role of Bryan Mills and he executed his role to perfection. Maggie Grace as his daughter was also good. The plot was fairly simple and a little bit predictable but the action was just amazing. Bryan Mills went to extreme measures to get his daughter back, you just knew he would do it, no matter how long it took and no matter how many risks he had to take. It was exhilarating, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.<br/><br/>It was a short lived film but I think that made it better, it just hit the spot perfectly. It was breathtaking. I could watch this film any time and it would still be great. I would highly recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>We're also left with one of the greatest quotes from a film - Bryan Mills ""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."" to which the villain replies down the phone ""Good luck."" - This is so memorable and really sets the film up for a thrilling ride.<br/><br/>Overall, one of the best films I have ever seen. 10/10."

"emailkristina89","1","206","381","26 September 2011"," A crime against human intellect
","I've never written a review before, but this movie angered me so much I felt it's my civic duty to protest.<br/><br/>The movie is so full of clichés and unrealistic it's unbelievable it was made by adults. Apparently, we're supposed to derive some kind of psychological gratification from the Freudian symbols of innocence, fatherly love, superhuman strength and righteousness. It actually reminds me of the fantasies I had when I was 8.<br/><br/>Here's the plot: a rich, spoiled American virgin girl goes to Paris with a friend and gets abducted by Albanians and sold into sex slavery. Luckily, her daddy happens to be a ex-CIA agent and tracks them down effortlessly, kills and tortures them in a blood-curdling fashion and gets to his daughter just before she gets her throat slit by the evil (yet also stupid looking so you can still feel good about yourself), toad-like sheik. On his way, daddy makes a such a spectacle of killing and torturing people that it makes you wonder whether anyone would take so much trouble if no third party was watching. He doesn't even spare people who are innocent and are unlucky enough to get in his way. Like the wife of a French agent involved in the mess, whom Neeson shoots in the arm, because her husband refuses to give him information on St-Claire. (Meanwhile, their kids have been tucked into bed 5 minutes ago yet they don't seem to wake up. Yep, totally.)<br/><br/>All the circumstances are miraculously in Neeson's favor. His daughter is talking to him on the phone when she gets abducted. (otherwise, how would he know? Most victims of sex slavery are poor East European girls who don't have cell-phones, which would be too boring). Also, she's standing in the bathroom from where she can see her friend being abducted first, so daddy has enough time to instruct her how to hide and to shout out the details of their complexion while being dragged away (at which she miraculously succeeds, despite her panic and the struggle she puts up).<br/><br/>Also, multiple men can apparently easily get into a hotel room and abduct two girls, but Neeson has to use Spiderman skills to get inside. Well, thank God the bas relief of the wall was adjusted to his height exactly; otherwise, the movie would have ended there.<br/><br/>Another point that disturbed me very much is Neeson indifference to the scores of other girls who have been drugged and raped by Albanians. Apparently, the PRINCIPLE of sex slavery doesn't concern him, just the fact that it happens to HIS daughter.<br/><br/>In the end, Neeson returns with his daughter to America, with only a broken arm after fighting hundreds of heavily-armed men. Also, he has no trouble leaving France after killing each and every one of them. (France must be a Third World country). Everyone is happy and his ex-wife has to admit he's not such a loser after all. Every Freudian fascination has been satisfied trice over.<br/><br/>This movie does absolutely no justice to Eastern Europeans (all Albanians are shown as stupid scum and we're supposed to gloat seeing them being electrocuted), and above all, the REAL victims of modern sex slavery. I could write a lot more about this piece of garbage but I think I've made my point now. Thank you for your attention."

","Liam Neeson as ""Bryan Mills,"" reminded me of Denzel Washington's role in ""Man On Fire."" In that film, Washington played a relentless-and-brutal bodyguard who did what he had to do to get kidnapped Dakota Fanning back to her parents.<br/><br/>Here, Neeson does the same to get his daughter ""Kim"" back from kidnappers/sex trade slime-balls. An ex-professional killer in retirement, ""Bryan"" travels to Paris and shows the bad guys who they're messing with!

It also looks good on Blu-Ray. Beware though: this is another ""shaky"" hand-held camera deal on the action scenes, which can be tough on your eyes at times.<br/><br/>One last thing: it's not ""non-stop action"" as I had some people say.

Perhaps it is the straightforward, nearly nonstop Liam Neeson-as-Steven Seagal action that is buoying the movie's reputation as it enters the rental phase of its life, or the legitimately serious topic of child exploitation / the worldwide child/young adult sex trade, but despite these strengths, the film also causes me to pause and consider its even more distressing qualities - plot holes and inconsistencies, ethnic stereotypes, and the exchanging of one inexcusable violence for another.<br/><br/>Plot Holes: Almost too numerous to mention. Take your pick. Why break into a 5th floor apartment in the middle of the day, carrying two young girls out kicking and screaming when you can pick them up for a ""party"" later, isolate them somewhere in the city, and then kidnap them? How does a man with an Irish/American brogue pass as a French police officer without speaking a word of French? Why does Neeson say he ""was a traitor, not a villain"" (or whatever he says on the rooftop) - was there any other explanation of this? I can do willing suspension of disbelief. Really. I know that it's meant to be mindless entertainment... but Rambo Does Paris? It's too much to be a film of any serious importance.<br/><br/>Ethnic Stereotypes: This was particularly bad - spoiled, ignorant Americans safe in their virginal land of California until they discover the dangers that lurk across the ocean in a ""foreign"" land... the French cutting deals with crudely stereotyped Albanians and Muslims (the ""Paris always surrenders"" myth) while the righteous Americans have to step in and kick tail... and on down the line. Worse still was the death of the traveling companion (because she has sex with boys) and the salvation of the daughter (spared long enough to be saved because she was pure and thus more valuable) - while this may be a dirty truth of the human slave trade, it still sends an unmistakably puritanical message to audiences.<br/><br/>Violence: Violence against women - especially sexual violence - is abhorrent. That being said, vigilantism, torture, and murder are no panacea for what ails human society. If everyone pulled a Liam Neeson, there would be anarchy.<br/><br/>A 7 or 8 out of 10 means that you want people to take a film seriously. This film, while interesting in some respects, adrenaline-pumping and exciting throughout, merits no more than a 5 or a 6 for those qualities. It is meant to be eye candy and a good mindless summer rental. It is NOT a serious film that will have a lasting impact upon cinema.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most disturbing thing to me as a member of the critically thinking (?) public is that lately we have been eating these sorts of movies up like it's our job - and then assigning critical kudos where none are deserved. Whether it's ""Wanted"" or ""Taken"", we are mistaking mindless action (which has its place at times) for Oscar-worthy material. I hope that we come to our senses soon and learn to keep the two in their separate spheres of influence.<br/><br/>A good summer rental. Nothing more. And please, I beg you, critically analyze the mixed messages of the film. I think you'll begin to see how many a moviegoer may have been ""Taken"" at the box office."

","To save you the time in either watching this film or reading my critique of it, here is a brief summary: This film is the worst film I have ever seen. This film is atrocious. This film is so unbelievably awful that all the writers, directors, producers and cast that worked on it should be sent to the Hague and tried for crimes against humanity.<br/><br/>In the first chapter of this film, three facts are established:<br/><br/>1. There exists a man. He's pretty tough. 2. He loves his daughter very much. 3. Aforementioned daughter is going to Paris.<br/><br/>In order to establish these three facts, which any competent writer or director could do in about ten minutes, the film takes over half an hour, quite possibly the most laborious half an hour in cinematic history.<br/><br/>As soon as the daughter reaches Paris, she is of course kidnapped. Literally AS SOON. So there is a sudden escalation in pace that doesn't leave the watcher thinking ""WOW, I didn't see that coming"" or ""Wo, what a skillful escalation in pace"" but simply ""OH Jesus Christ SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD THANK GOD THAT SOMETHING FINALLY HAPPENED!"" This sudden plot ""twist"" of course makes the liberal mother and fat, short stereotypically wealthy stepfather look villainous and the absurdly-paranoid-to-the-degree-that-he-should-seek-professional-help father, who believes his daughter is safer in Los Angeles than Paris, becomes the all-knowing hero.<br/><br/>And of course the CIA can detect from a tiny and poor-quality voice sample the hometown of any speaker. So we learn that the daughter has been kidnapped by an Albanian gang who intend to sell her into sex slavery. This is of course the point where the film ceases to be just bad and becomes outright immoral: people trafficking with the intent of prostitution is a real and tangible problem in Europe and indeed all over the world (if you want to see an actually worthy film that deals with the issue I suggest ""Eastern Promises"", ""Dirty Pretty Things"" or ""Spare Parts""). Making it the subject of a Hollywood action film in which the American hero overcomes all the odds to rescue his daughter is insulting to those women who have actually been in this situation. Particularly appalling is the scant disregard that our ""hero"" shows for the wellbeing of any of the other women. It left me questioning ""is it supposed to be ironic? morally ambiguous? No, it's just a film that chose a very sensitive and inappropriate subject for a formula-produced action movie.<br/><br/>As the film continues we are given more and more ridiculous scenes that insult our intelligence. One particularly stupid oversight comes when the hero walks into a brothel posing as a Parisian police officer and the villains show absolutely no suspicion of his being impostor, despite the fact that he talks exclusively in English.<br/><br/>And the most ridiculously appalling scene comes at the very end. The girl is safe as she returns from Paris to Los Angeles. Finally, back in America, where everyone's safe! In spite of murdering and torturing so many people and shooting the wife of a leading Parisian police officer, our hero steps off the plane with absolutely no problems. Despite her best friend's death and a terrible ordeal, the girl is happy and shows no signs of trauma whatsoever. And in spite of the thousands of women who suffer in sex slavery every day of their lives, a plight which this film does absolutely nothing to enlighten the world on, we are made to believe this is a happy ending.<br/><br/>This film is an insult to my continent and my intelligence, and a mockery of so many people who suffer in silence.<br/><br/>But I'm European, so of course, I'm an evil people-trafficker n'all..."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","15","22","4 June 2009"," Next time Liam Neeson says ""I will find you and kill you"", you better watch out!
","As you all know I am very rarely wrong(note the sarcasm, lol), well this is one of those cases where I was extremely wrong. When I saw the trailer for the movie Taken, I thought ""Oh, great, another 'surprising and suspenseful' thriller that will I'm sure be the ending we never saw coming"", after all I've seen way too many of those movies. But after so many positive reviews of this movie I decided to go ahead and give it a fair shot. I adore Liam Neeson, but when I heard the role that he took as a deadly agent that you don't wanna mess with, I was in question. I tell you, this movie took me by complete and total surprise, this was a great movie. The story is something that we've seen a million times before, but what made this movie more special then the others are the fantastic performances and script that made this into an exciting and intense thriller.<br/><br/>Bryan Mills is a retired CIA operative from their elite Special Activities Division. He describes his former job as being a ""preventer,"" but has recently retired in Los Angeles solely in order to be close to his 17-year-old daughter Kim who now lives with his ex-wife Lenore and her new wealthy husband Stuart. Mills discovers that Kim wants to take a holiday trip to Paris, with her friend Amanda. Despite his initial concerns about the trip, Mills allows her to go, later discovering that their actual plan is to travel around Europe following the band U2. Arriving at the Paris airport, Kim and Amanda meet a Frenchman named Peter, who offers to share a taxi with them to their apartment. When they arrive, Amanda reveals to Peter that she and Kim are unsupervised, because her family is in Spain. Peter invites the two girls to a party; Kim is reluctant, but Amanda, who is sexually attracted to Peter, hastily agrees. In the house, Kim receives a phone call from her father, which she answers in the bathroom. From the bathroom window, she sees men entering the main room and abducting Amanda. Mills is able to gain critical information about the kidnappers in the final moments after Kim is kidnapped by telling her to shout out everything about them that she notices. Briefly, Mills talks to one of the kidnappers, warning him that unless Kim is released, he will pursue him and kill him.<br/><br/>Seriously, I'm so glad that I was wrong about this movie, I couldn't tell you how many times I had my hands over my face or cheered or screamed during this movie, it was so exciting. Liam Neeson, I couldn't believe how scary he was, I've seen him in tough guy roles before but just the delivery of the line ""I will find you and kill you"" was delivered so perfectly, just calm, cold and confident. I just loved how the bad guy said ""good luck"", yeah, he wasn't as confident when Liam popped up in to get his revenge. Another thing about this movie that I absolutely loved is that it wasn't one of those ""big twist"" endings that are so stupid and predictable, this was just one of those ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"" situations. I highly recommend Taken if you get the chance to see it, it's exciting and a great movie. Liam is one dude you do not want to mess with.<br/><br/>8/10"

","OK, here goes.<br/><br/>You need to get past some poor direlogue and cheesy moments/acting in the first half of this film, as the moment the daughter is ""Taken"" is the moment this film will start to knock your socks off.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson makes for a very good 70's style hero, although the accent waivers. Cant believe he passed himself off as a french policeman speaking in English in a Irish/American accent when he goes undercover in a scene, but thats the scripts fault not his.<br/><br/>Other actors range from competent to annoying (Daughter...) but nevertheless, this film has fight scenes that are sharp, realistic, nasty and well edited.<br/><br/>Kudo's to the sound designer who makes every punch and neck crack painful!!

"diac228","9","14","21","1 February 2010"," Of all the women we kidnap, we happen to nab the one with a deadly spy as a father....just our luck...
","Remember that time period when Hollywood used to release incredible action/thriller movies in an orderly pace? Neither do I. What used to be a great trend to participate in back in the 90s (Terminator 2, Speed, Face-Off, The Rock, Con Air, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, Jurassic Park, The Mummy, The Matrix, Bad Boys, Under Siege, True Lies, Desperado, Clear and Present Danger, The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Saving Private Ryan, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) suddenly became a distant memory, as the 2000s served very few decent Hollywood thrillers. Instead, we have to head overseas to find them. The 2000s consisted of many surprise-surprise excellent European actioneers with Hot Fuzz, Run Lola Run, Transporter, Kiss of the Dragon, Unleashed, and this superb flick. <br/><br/>What happens nowadays is that Hollywood is scaling back its amount of action in order to make the extra money. In the first paragraph, 15 of the 19 movies I mentioned from the 90s were rated-R. In other words, they did not care about the PG-13 rating. Now, nearly every action movie must hit the PG-13 barrier. Even the fourth Die Hard was edited to not reach rated-R (which was a Die Hard staple). To add to that movies from overseas (like this one) become edited in the States in order to hit the weaker and friendlier PG-13. But don't let that stop you. Taken is one of the most vicious PG-13 movies you'll ever see, and you'll enjoy every minute of its inability to cut back on the gruesomeness. It sounds barbaric, I know, but if you truly want to see what good action used to look like from the studios of Tinseltown, look no further than this excellent effort. <br/><br/>Luc Besson and his talented filming crew provide yet another gripping story to sink your teeth into. This time it's about a retired spy (Liam Neeson) who searches all of Europe in order to find his kidnapped daughter (Maggie Grace). He is given a small time frame, since his daughter is about to be sold into the deep, disgusting, and grueling underworld of sex trafficking. The movie starts off with Bryan, the spy, trying to adjust to a life without espionage, and the rest is just a wild roller coaster ride containing plentiful action scenes and fight after fight. Written by Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, Taken provides a healthy dosage of father-daughter sentimentality as well as provide an insight into a dangerous illegal world not seen often in movies. <br/><br/>But it's not just the delightful taste of gunfire, fights, and chases that maintains the entertainment in Taken. Liam Neeson does an excellent job portraying the retired spy. While there are indeed great action stars, very few of them are excellent actors as well. Liam Neeson can proudly say he fits both billings, as his version of a spy is just as cold and calculating as even Daniel Craig's James Bond. Most amazing fact is that he is over 55 years of age. While Jason Bourne remains the most lethal of all the movie character spies in the last decade, Bryan isn't too far behind. While everyone else in the movie delivers decent performances, it's Neeson that runs and carries the show with a mix of emotion, determination, and rage. <br/><br/>Pierre Morel directs this movie well, by keeping the action within a decent view, maintaining good pacing, and also allowing for the actors to breathe out a scene when more emotion is involved. The fights themselves are brutal, and not held back in the least bit. You will feel every blow, you will chuckle at every clever maneuver and trick, and sometimes even jump in surprise as to what's happening. The movie is quite cold, as sometimes you'll forget that Bryan is the good guy, especially in moments where innocent people are within the crosshairs. Like Jason Bourne in The Bourne Supremacy, it's at times difficult to root for Neeson when he involves people that well.aren't really involved. But that feeling is quickly vanquished when you see him waste the next sap that is part of the sex trafficking ring. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: This movie proves multiple things: Neeson can be an action star at a relatively old age, Europe is suddenly a rising force in the action/thriller genre, and also that you don't need fancy CGI or special effects to craft a good movie that will also lead to good money. Taken quietly emerged as the top action film of 2009, and becomes another great film with Luc Besson's stamp on it (The Fifth Element, Unleashed, Transporter, Nikita, Leon). The movie has the trills and the tension, but also has the heart that is sorely missing in most mainstream action films. You will cheer this movie on as it delivers with a great storyline, great acting, and just an overall satisfying cinematic package. <br/><br/>Did I already mention that Liam Neeson is 57 years old?"

"UlfSAndersson","6","31","53","30 November 2008"," Entertain the dark side of yourself
","This is really a quite nonsensical and completely implausible film and not to be recommended to anyone that seeks anything more substantial. The first ten-fifteen minutes are quite embarrassing for everyone involved. Then there is non-stop action. And here is where all the (six) stars come from, well executed action, no less. No need to write anything about the plot other than that the seventeen-year old daughter of a US-trained killing machine get kidnapped by the Albanian mob. He finds all the bad guys, kills everyone and rescues his daughter. Again, the ending was embarrassing. The emotions displayed by the young woman been through kidnapping, drug abuse, the death of her best friend and most probably rape (although never mentioned), was something that felt like the passing of an old aunt. So, what about the dark side. Well, nothing more than that you kind of enjoy the endless killing of all the worthless people involved in slavery and prostitution. Definitely a waste of time, but still very entertaining."
"YouSeenThat","8","21","34","26 December 2008"," Bond ain't got anything on Liam Neeson.
","The latest rescue-slash-revenge film to hit our screens, Taken, tries to walk the fine line between the two classic character archetypes - family man and ultimate badass. When the estranged seventeen year old daughter of a former spy (Liam Neeson) is kidnapped while holidaying overseas, her father must call upon his unique skill set in order to rescue her before she becomes lost to the Eastern-European slave trade.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson kicking ass, and the potential of Maggie Grace showing a little - Taken had my full and undivided attention.<br/><br/>As with the majority of films that limp onto the silver screen these days, everything seems to be a remake of a remake, or at the very least, a rehash of a tired idea. What separates a stock-standard retelling, from something that will stay with you longer than a half-masticated corn kernel stuck in your teeth, will almost certainly come down to the execution. Take a well-worn concept, freshen it up a little, but ultimately pull it off with dedication and skill. While Taken is by no means perfect, it is a prime example of a well-executed retelling. Let's face it, the concept of a tough guys daughter getting kidnapped, and having said tough guy track her down, defeating a million bad guys in the process is hardly anything new. It's basically the plot of Commando, or a dozen similar films for that matter. What Taken does well is to play on this tried-and-true formula; it adds depth to the usual one-dimensional characters, and mixes it up in a giant cocktail shaker with stylistic elements that made films like The Bourne Identity such crowd-pleasers.<br/><br/>Our first encounter with former spy, Bryan, is less than exhilarating. You'd almost expect to see some incredible action set piece from his pre-retirement days, something that adequately introduces our brooding badass' action hero qualifications - negative. What we get is the image of Bryan asleep on the lounge at home, a well-thumbed pamphlet for a karaoke machine on his lap. He's after the perfect gift for his seventeen year old daughter's birthday, and from what we can establish, he's terribly indecisive when it comes to purchasing a present. It's kind of amusing that after less than two minutes of screen time, we've probably already experienced more character development and insight into our main character than we would experience in just about any other similar film. Amusing, and sad. On the surface, Bryan doesn't appear to be that different from you or I, he seemingly has the same faults, shortcomings and fears that we all do. It's not until his daughter is kidnapped that we see an entirely different side of Bryan emerge.<br/><br/>Following on from the initial character development, the film moves quickly onto the search for Kim, Bryan's daughter. With Bryan as our guide, we navigate the murky underworld of Paris, our former spy using every trick in his book to find clues of his daughter's whereabouts. Without giving away too much of the story from this point, our lead character pulls out all the stops. The action set pieces are amazing and uncompromising in their realism and brutality, and while there are occasional moments where the suspension of disbelief is crucial, for the most part it's very much on the money. Guns boom with a satisfying reverb, bullets hit their mark with dead-eye accuracy, and Bryan proves that nothing is sacred when it comes to getting his daughter back alive.<br/><br/>Now I'll be honest and say that Taken wasn't entirely perfect - I did have a few criticisms of the film. My first, and major beef was with our lead characters detective work when it came to tracking-down his daughter - somehow it all seemed far too 'path of least resistance', the quickest way to get from Point A to Point B. Everything felt too easy, even for a man who used to be a highly-trained intelligence operative. Rather than simply moving from one clue to the next, knowing exactly where to go and how to play his cards, I would have preferred to have had another fifteen or so minutes to pad out this side of the story - maybe even throwing in a few failed lines on inquiry just to make it a little more believable. Secondly, there were a few holes in the logic, like a particular scene where Bryan pretends to be a French police officer/intelligence operative, using a completely stock standard American accent - who the hell would buy that? Apparently the bad guys did. And last but not least, I did pick-up on a few editing issues. Take the scene where Bryan collects a fiber of the bad guys clothing - absolutely pointless. Nothing ever came of this scene. However that was minor compared to the most innocuous editing issue - key parts of the kidnap scene that seem to have gone missing. What do I mean? Well, I don't remember the daughter Kim yelling out any information on her attackers, as instructed by her father... yet Bryan seemed to have it all on tape when he passed it off to his CIA buddy for analysis.<br/><br/>Overall, Taken was a pleasant surprise. It's often difficult to tell what to expect from these types of co-funded foreign films, but this one was certainly worth the money. While some of the initial 'detective work' by Neeson's character seemed very effortless and simply the easiest way to get from Point A to Point B, i.e. straight into the action, the action scenes themselves certainly made up for any shortcomings. No punches were pulled. The world our characters inhabited was dark, unforgiving, and morally ambiguous, and as a result, the methods used to get his daughter back were as equally dark, unforgiving, and morally ambiguous. Forget about Bond and Bourne - these guys ain't got anything on Liam Neeson.<br/><br/>Edited excerpt from: www.youseenthat.com"

","It's been a long time since I watched an action movie and was so involved, riveted to the screen, and rooted so much for the main character as when I saw last weekend the thriller Taken (2008) written by Luc Besson and directed by Pierre Morel. The film has not been released in the USA yet even though it's been out for months in Europe and Asia. I don't understand why because as the action movies go, this is very entertaining and dynamic picture.<br/><br/>The plot involves the kidnapping of an American girl (Maggie Grace) vacationing with a friend in Paris, by the gang of Albanian human traffickers specializing in selling young women into forced prostitution. Her estranged father Bryan (Liam Neeson), a retired CIA agent, the member of the elite ""Special Activities Division"" Black operations is on the phone with his daughter at the very moment of kidnapping and he's got just a few days to find out who is behind the crime and to try to get his daughter back before it is too late. If you've seen the trailer for the movie, the Neeson's close up and his short but convincing speech addressed to the invisible unknown man who is listening to his daughter's cell phone, would tell you everything you have to know: ""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."" The film follows this statement closely, and makes it a really fast running 93 minutes. The plot is anything but new - back in 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger as retired elite commando had only a few hours to find and rescue his daughter from an exiled dictator. The first and by far the best season of hit TV series 24 had Kiefer Sutherland as LA based CTU Agent Jack Bauer chasing of all sorts of terrorists who taken his teenage daughter. In its bets moments, Taken brings as much excitement and adrenalin as these classics. Another thought came to my mind while watching the movie, if ever Liam Neeson was considered for the part of Bond, James Bond? If not 007 himself, he could have easily been s Bond's older brother, less glamorous but as dangerous and deadly.<br/><br/>Taken touches on horrific but sadly existing and blooming business of international women trafficking, the slave trade of our times. Do not expect the movie make some serious social comments or provide the deep insight into the dirtiest business possible. Neeson's hero is not out to save thousands of lost forever young women, he is trying to find and safe one girl only who just happened not to know how lucky she was to have a deadly killing machine for a dad. I don't recall when was last time I felt as satisfied as when Bryan let disgusting and despicable villains of different social standings have it with great vengeance and furious anger. I saw perfectly clear all movie's weaknesses and clichés while I was watching it but it never bored me, it was non-stopping action, and it had a hero whom I desperately wanted to succeed. Perfect or not - I liked Taken a lot and would recommend it without hesitation."

"RossRivero99","9","3","3","28 February 2017"," A very well paced action movie cut into 93 minutes
","Pierre Morel's ""Taken"" is an action movie that ranks among the best of it's generation despite the title sort of being predictable and giving the whole story away. The movie focuses on a retired CIA agent named Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) who has an ex-wife named Lenore (Famke Janssen) and a daughter named Kim (Maggie Grace). In the opening scene of this movie we see Mills go to his daughter's birthday party and is there only for a short time all he really does is get there give his daughter a present but not without confrontation from his ex-wife and he says hello to her new husband Casey (Jon Gries). Then the next day we see Bryan, Lenore, and Kim having lunch at a restaurant and Kim asks him if she can go to Paris, France with her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy), at first he is reluctant but then after he is demanded to do it he gives in while still being reluctant to do it. Then we see Kim get kidnapped and once Bryan finds out about it he sets out to find who kidnapped her and send her back to her family and he will do anything to accomplish that which is what the tag-line of the movie happens to give away but I won't spoil it beyond here. In the movie Liam Neeson, Famke Janssen, and Maggie Grace gave such good performances in the movie, but the only problem I had with it was that the movie could have had a better title in order to make it less of a predictable movie which made the film focus more on the plot elements than on the actual characters, but it was suspenseful in some aspects. This wasn't a great movie but it was good and entertaining but it also would have been better if it had Hitchcockian like plot elements added to it, but otherwise it worked as a short action movie."

","All I've got to say is...Liam Neeson has still got it!<br/><br/>With fast paced action sequences and a genius story-line, Taken does not fault on any aspects. Even more, what makes this film so heart-wrenching is its absolute plausibility that will make you think twice about sending your kids anywhere, even out the front door. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson gives one of his best performances playing the role of Bryan Mills, a retired CIA agent on a 'stop-at-nothing' rampage to find his kidnapped daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), who is being sold into prostitution. <br/><br/>Taken, beautifully showcases the father/daughter relationship between Neeson and Graces' characters, and you can't help but lovingly sigh at the way Bryon Mills growls, 'I don't know where you are...but if you don't let my daughter go, i will find you, i will kill you' Isn't that just beautiful?<br/><br/>This film will have you past the 'edge-of-your-seat' stage and onto the floor, until the very end."

","I liked it. This film is basically about a Bourne-type character who goes after his kidnapped daughter whose been taken for the sex slavery trade.<br/><br/>It has the usual clichés - kidnapped tourists turned into drugged sex slaves - Albanian gangsters - Arab slavers - which panders to your xenophobic side. And a super spy which kicks their asses. How macho is that? But hey, it does have a big element of truth there. The female sex slavery trade is alive and well and those groups do take a big part in it. This truth may bother your liberal tendencies - deal with it. Its just as accurate as any of Michael Moore or Al Gore's films. :) Now that I've dumped on your lunch, I thought the film pacing, story, was pretty good. It probably won't win many Academy Awards which would be going to a film about a deafnblind mime. But you won't be falling asleep and your girlfriend and daughters would probably be more careful when they go traveling. I'll give it 10/10 - an extra 3 because of films like History Boys which was a totally horrible film."
"Sirus_the_Virus","10","3","3","5 August 2009"," Alas, Liam Neeson kicks ass.
","Liam Neeson kicks major ass in the fantastic action flick Taken. Taken was the first film I saw in 2009. It's the only film that i've bought somewhere other than Movie Gallery or Blockbuster. I bought it when it first came to DVD. Taken is a very awesome crowd pleaser that's far from disappointing.Taken is one of the best films of 2009 so far. The best is Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. But Taken isn't far from there. The Plot: Retired C.I.A. agent Bryan Mills comes out of retirement to save his daughter in Paris. She was kidnapped by sex traffickers, who take young teens, drug them, and turn them into prostitutes. Bryan will stop at nothing to find and kill these men. Taken is from writer Luc Besson, who wrote films like The Fifth Element, Some of The Transporter, and the passable Taxi. Taken is probably his best work yet. Taken is filled with spectacular action sequences, and dozens of plausible moments. Liam Neeson kicks many asses and I just cheer every time. I also think it's funny because the pricks who kidnapped his daughter deserve an ass whooping. The film is nothing but entertainment, and I loved Taken."
"Jackpollins","10","3","3","1 August 2009"," A great action film, and Liam Neeson steals the show
","The problem with a lot of action-thrillers is that the guy who is forced to step in and save the day does not have any experience. That's why I am happy to report Taken is here. Here Liam Neeson plays Bryan Mills, an ex-FBI agent who is forced to use his skills to save his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). The film is about how Bryan, after much skepticism lets his daughter, Kim go to Europe with her friend, Amanda (Katie Cassidy). Just by the title, it is needless to say Bryan is right. Kim and Amanda share a cab ride with a man named Peter (Nicolas Giraud), only to figure out he is part of a large group that kidnaps women to sell them for prostitution. Now Bryan is forced to step in and use his learned skills to kick some butt and save his daughter. This is truly a great action film. The acting is great, the action fantastic, and the movie is fast-paced, and despite a slow beginning never skips a beat. Neeson is great here, perfectly mixing sweetness and harshness to make one of the most surprisingly memorable movie character. You also enjoy seeing Neeson using non-violent, clever methods to save his daughter. So if you're looking for a good time at the movies, go see Taken."

","The teaser warns how dangerous Liam is and the set-up is enticing... slave trade, kidnapped daughter and so on. Liam had a team of high-tech people to help him...but goes it alone. It's like Mission Impossible, except it's not Tom going solo this time. This should have been a great action film, with gadgets and planning, with a team working together to not only get back Liam's daughter, but bring down the entire kidnapping/slave trade organization. Instead, it's just one string of killings and fight scenes, followed by chases -- plus the baddies are the worst possible shots in the world. At one point machine guns blast away from near point-blank range, shooting holes through the doors and windows of Liam's car...but every shot misses both Liam and the girl in the back seat. And when it's not ridiculous that so many bullets could miss, the shooters simply can't hit a standing target twenty feet away. This would have been a great film if Liam hadn't gone it alone. And he left most of the enslaved girls in the hands of the baddies. What kind of hero is that?"

","Seeing as most revenge movies take place after a tragedy has already taken place and the ""hero"" has trouble dealing with the aftermath, Taken deals with a protagonist who takes his revenge while fighting to prevent the tragedy from becoming irreversible. <br/><br/>I kinda felt it was a fresh take on the brooding and lonely ""hero"" on a suicide mission to get revenge, as in Taken he isn't really on a suicide mission as he has to make sure his daughter is safe and make sure she gets home. <br/><br/>The fact that it tries to be authentic with both real world problems and a more realistic approach to the action sequences makes it very rewarding to watch as you keep rooting for him to save her and take out as many bad guys as possible. It's very clear he's the good guy and the bad guys have no redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>All in all it works really well for what it is and feels very rewarding when watching it. It does a lot of things right no matter how accurate things are portrayed as it conveys them as though they are. A fantastic action/revenge movie."

","One of Liam Neeson's best performances. Taken was the movie that helped me discover that Liam Neeson is one of my all time favourite actors. It was brutal and gripping, with great cast. A 90 minute thrill ride for me, intense and action-packed. If you didn't think that Liam Neeson could be an action star, you were wrong. After Schindler's List, Neeson's performance in Taken is the most memorable of all his performances. I've happy that they're making a 3rd Taken film. The first 2 were great, especially this one. Taken is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and not get tired of the action. <br/><br/>I was surprised that Taken was an 18 certificate in the UK when I've watched films like Kick-Ass 2 and Prisoners which are rated 15 but have much more graphic violence in.<br/><br/>No complaints for Taken, a definite must-see movie."

","I saw this film a while back and loved it. Recently I was looking at the reviews here and was surprised at some of the negative comments that it has received. After making note of the more common complaints I decided to watch it again to see if any of them were warranted. I just finished watching it and I've come to the conclusion that most of the problems people had were completely unreasonable.<br/><br/>The first complaint was that it was insensitive to the real life problem of sex trafficking, because the main character didn't go out of his way to save every heroin addicted slave prostitute that he came across.--Well what was he supposed to do, rent a bus and let them all jones out in the back as he's offing scumbags? Remember he has 96 hours to save his daughter minus the 20 hours it took to get to Europe.<br/><br/>The second complaint was that it portrayed Albanians in a negative light. --- Well this movie wasn't about normal Albanians, it was about Albanian sex traffickers. So, I guess the writers should be sorry they portrayed Albanian sex traffickers in a negative light? The other complaint was that it supposedly took too long to get to the action. So I guess you don't like any kind of back story in your action movies? You just want people randomly killing people without any explanation? It took 30 minutes to establish his relationship with his daughter followed by 60 minutes of nonstop action. Take it easy.<br/><br/>The other complaint was that it was somehow offensive to Europeans because it somehow suggested that America is safer than Europe.---Oh yes, it's a common belief here in the U.S. that our country of unrestricted gun ownership is much safer than gunless Europe. Come on people, it's just a hypothetical situation and the only reason it took place in Europe is because we don't have as much human trafficking here (at least not in this century).<br/><br/>There were several more complaints that can all be answered with the simple explanation of IT's Just A FKEAKING Movie. It's a bunch of hypothetical situation strung together in an entertaining way. It's not trying to make a political statement, or raise awareness about one thing or another. It's just an excuse to watch fictitious A-holes get what's coming to them as they so rarely do in real life.<br/><br/>I give it 9 stars to counteract the haters. In reality 7.9 is very accurate I would say."

"phue_fighter","4","57","109","19 February 2009"," Nothing more than a Director's highly overrated mess.
","Alright, I watched the movie about a few weeks ago and after seeing its ratings on IMDb I was expecting a really good action movie with good acting, a wholesome plot and obviously some amazing action. An 8.0 rating on IMDb means it's equal to movies like 'The Matrix' or 'Die Hard'.<br/><br/>Admittedly I'm quite a big action fan, and I do understand the concept of it not being 'realistic'. That's what films are. They're stories. Name me one movie that is completely realistic with no fantasy elements included and I'll give you a million bucks.<br/><br/>However when I saw this movie I was bored, embarrassed during some scenes at how atrocious it was, and I found it to be completely overrated. The action was slow, the cinematography was laughable, the acting from everyone except Neeson was very sub-par and I just felt disappointed. This isn't the action movie that would start a second renaissance, of course not. That's not what I was expecting. I didn't think it'd be anything more than a tour-de-force action film that was pure entertainment and silliness wrapped into a satisfying bubble. And honestly all I got was another second-rate action movie that's not even worth the time and effort to watch unless you're an extreme fan of the genre. I mean, during the scene where Neeson runs to the boat to get his daughter... the camera cuts so many times and there's about a million shots of his car in different angles that I completely forgot what was going on. That's just an example of the many things I thought brought the movie down.<br/><br/>I really don't see how this film deserves the recognition it has received. I've read the forums and people say ""well it's an action flick... you're not supposed to take it seriously!"" To that I say, why isn't Meet the Spartans in the IMDb 250? ""Well, it's a parody flick, you're not supposed to take it seriously""? The same principal applies.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to say the film isn't enjoyable because that's down to tastes. I'm just saying firstly; film technicalities (i.e. the direction, photography, musical score) were atrocious and anyone with a basic knowledge of film and its production will recognize this.<br/><br/>Secondly; the acting of the support cast quite bad. Not Troll 2 bad, but still not something you'd expect to see in a Liam Neeson movie. More like something you'd see in one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies from the 80's.<br/><br/>Thirdly; the directing was very amateurish. I felt this constant need to find Pierre Morel and hit him every time the scenes went on too long. He'd be extremely bruised right now.<br/><br/>I really wonder how the screenplay went for this movie, too. I'm guessing the writers/artists got very proud of their ability to draw and started getting excited during the car scenes, resulting in about 200 frames of a car from as many different angles as possible. And the director just went ""Hey, why not? It's action, right?"".<br/><br/>I haven't mention the plausibility of this movie, because anyone here could go to the LOTR forums and start asking how some old dude with a beard has magical powers, or why some big dude explodes when he loses his ring, and we'd all be stumped for argument other than to say the same lines I've seen being used here.<br/><br/>But for god's sake this is a generic action movie, not an Oscar-deserving masterpiece. If someone can tell me how I'm wrong, why this movie DOES deserve its rating and explain to me what I missed, I will be very grateful.<br/><br/>For anyone who thinks I'm talking nonsense - check out http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/taken/?critic=creamcrop and see how they rated this movie. These people are professional critics..."

","I always root for the little guy, whether it is the character or the filmmaker. It's why I love independent film. It's why I applaud Charles Bronson and Bruce Willis and all the films where they stand up to some half-baked criminal scum. It's why I wanted to like TAKEN, this scrappy little picture that took on big money titles and thumped them at the box office.<br/><br/>But TAKEN is a troubling case. As much as it pretends to be a ""revenge"" picture – and it is as predictable as the worst of them – TAKEN is a movie filled with dangerous, racist ideas. It makes troubling statements about America values, the exploitation of our fears, and the way we vilify sex but glorify violence. What does it say about us as a society that TAKEN, easily one of the most violently offensive movies I've viewed in years, became a box office sensation? Or that it remains so highly rated by IMDb users?<br/><br/>Liam Neeson stars as an ex-CIA agent whose daughter is kidnapped by sex traders in France, now the most dangerous country in the European Union(?). He immediately vows to kill these scum; you've got to see his ridiculous negotiation scenes to believe it. And then he proceeds to follow through in a manner that would make Charles Bronson blush. He tracks hordes of these foreign devils down and breaks their necks or shoots them or guts them or chases them into oncoming traffic. He shows no mercy. He's so busy smashing skulls open twenty at a time, that he can't be bothered to rescue other teenage victims of the sex trade.<br/><br/>Apparently only his daughter, a pony loving virgin (I kid you not), is worth saving. The rest of the kidnapped girls, dozens of them, are left in drug-induced stupors to be continually raped by bearded Albanians. Not only is TAKEN absolute rubbish, it is absolutely insulting to women, the French, and most intelligent life on this planet.<br/><br/>I've never done this before, but shame on all you who found entertainment in this vile excuse for an action film. And shame on Liam Neeson for having participated in this misogynistic excuse for entertainment. It really is that bad, an externalization of the fear of the foreigner, written by Frenchman Luc Besson at a time when his country is attempting to outlaw Muslim attire.<br/><br/>The fact that this movie received a PG-13 rating, despite scene after scene of violence and teenage rape is incomprehensible.

There wasn't one bit of the film which I can state as boring. <br/><br/>I read one's comment here of how the father (Liam Neeson) just left the other girls abandoned to go find his daughter. He didn't have much of a choice, did he? Or else his daughter would have ended up the same way and he didn't have time. They can't cover everything within 90 minutes of the film and I guess something should be left on common sense and a little imagination.<br/><br/>Overall, Liam Neeson was brilliant and brought justice to the character he played.

The enemy always comes at him one at a time, because the director must like 60s kung-fu movies. 4. The enemy security agents have no training.<br/><br/>B. The Albanians don't question the fact that an Englishman with a reasonable facsimile of an American accent is shaking them down, with only a possible stolen business card to back his position. <br/><br/>C. All the other dead people are just nameless-faceless ciphers to be deposed of by the Hero in pursuit of the only person that matters, the daughter. The movie has a supposedly nice happy ending, but there are several parents of dead abducted prostitutes morning their equally valuable daughters.<br/><br/>D. Someone must have told Morel that Albanians don't send a shiver of repulsion down American spines, like they might do in Italy. Better add some dastardly A-rabs.<br/><br/>E. Even French workmen won't line up to have sex with drugged out, track-marked prostitutes. There are plenty of those available in every European train station. <br/><br/>F.

Getting wealthy American and western European parents,, with possible high level connections, would be bad for business.<br/><br/>G.

I just wish the release date would be the same in the United States as abroad. Supporting cast is solid.Action seens ae intense and much more realistic then what is normally shot.

Liam is sent across the sea to Paris to locate her as she was kidnapped not days before she became a victim of female trafficking. With Liam already p****d off enough as it is, he fights his way through Paris to find his missing girl. And whilst the story seems like a pessimistic tale of a heartbroken father searching for his daughter, it really isn't just that! The action elements of the movie are truly compelling, whilst I was tempted to go and grab for my tea on the floor below my sofa, I simply could not. Every chance Liam had at smashing heads into the wall or quite simply teaching them a lesson, he did it with such might and fury (not for the faint-hearted), so missing a second would be enough to miss it all.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, the father did succeed in finding his daughter in the end, and they did live on, but as a consequence to killing all those people to get to his daughter: all the relatives sent out to kill him in the sequel Taken 2. But I think we can all agree that T2 can be a film we can just forget about with it's quite simply: sloppy story and confusing motive. It was just a disaster on many levels."

","This must be the time of the year for old men to open some big ol' cans of whoop-ass; first we had Clint Eastwood as the sour racist in Gran Torino, and next we have Liam Neeson on a globe-trotting mission to return his daughter. Now all we need is them to star in a crossover. He's Taken My Gran Torino, anyone?<br/><br/>Taken is not so much a revenge thriller as it is kidnapping film with revenge simply tagging along for the ride. And it's quite a ride. Bryan Mills (Neeson) does everything he can to please his daughter Kim. (Lost's Maggie Grace) He has retired earlier then his colleagues from his job as a spy, he moves to California to be nearer to her and his ex (Famke Janssen) in an attempt to reconnect and regain his lost years. While Kim adores her father, his disciplined background keeps them at a distance so when the opportunity comes to allow Kim to take a trip to Paris with her friend, Bryan reluctantly takes the points, and allows her to go. But shortly after arrival, Kim and her friend are taken my unknown assailants, and it is up to Bryan to track down and rescue Kim before she vanishes forever.<br/><br/>Taken succeeds because of three things. Firstly the characters and the actors playing them (especially Neeson) are developed enough and do sufficient enough acting jobs to lend a lot of credibility to the unlikely scenario. Secondly, the low key way the story unfolds somehow manages to mask the highly preposterous likelihood Kim would ever be found and thirdly because of its thrilling and gritty action which never for a second fails to entertain. After seeing this film I was bothered by why I enjoyed Taken so much more then other revenge or kidnapping films like 2007's Death Sentence which I found to be both utterly ridiculous and morally repugnant. While Taken had its somewhat sadistic scenes, it never felt morally bankrupt like other films of its ilk. It finally clicked at random; Taken is driven by an objective, an end goal, for Bryan to return his daughter. Similar films are driven only by revenge and chronicle the vigilante killings and promote jumbled messages. Like I stated in the opening of this review, the killings are the means to an end, and because of that it is far easier to enjoy.<br/><br/>I have no hesitation in calling Taken the best action movie of the year and it is certainly a joy to see Neeson back on screen and doing something different and entertaining. It just lends to the long running trend that acting is usually the last thing to go wrong with a film, and with somebody like Neeson at the helm, Taken achieves a whole new level credibility and could mark the beginning of a new face in the world of action.<br/><br/>Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

Even when I was sitting during the film, I knew something big and exciting was happening, although it may not be a happy experience for ""Kim"" :).<br/><br/>This movie has every elements that an action-thriller movie should have and must have. A lot of bullets, car chasing, hand fight, drug, a superman-like protagonist and a beauty kidnapped. Although I found the onset of the whole story a bit strange, the development of it appealed to me. Liam Neeson was perfectly fit in his role. Highlight was the scene where he negotiated with Marko, I couldn't imagine who anyone else can do this acting as convincing as Neeson.<br/><br/>Somewhere I have read a comment, if you like Jason Bourne, a dude with a gun killing round, then you should like this one too."
"cuyahoga-1","1","74","154","12 September 2008"," One of the worst films ever..really!!
","Taken. <br/><br/>Sometimes you just wish that you had the power to press 'pause' in a movie and just tell the punters ""Look...this is one of the worst movies of all time...it's trash and I'm going to show you why"". Taken should NEVER have been made. Now for every reviewer that has liked Taken, let me assure you that you are wrong. Is it that every story has been told in cinema, that we must deal with the same old same old...over and over again?? There was NOTHING original in this film. Luc Besson has proved time and again that he can't write. This is his Citizen Kane! Taken is every action/thriller cliché thrown into one violent shambles. Neeson is a retired agent, who is suffering guilt at a wrecked marriage and at being a bad dad. Yawn. Famke Janssen is the ex-wife. She now is married to a dull rich guy. She rants that Liam was never there for her or the daughter. After spending five minutes with them, you know why! They are horrible! Liam can't compete for the love of his hideous daughter. He buys her a karaoke machine, cos she wants to be a singer! We never get to hear Maggie Grace sing...but then again, we never got to see her act either. New dad buys her a horse, which she rides around her party. Liam takes lots of photos on his throwaway product placement camera...to put in the photo album he keeps of daughters' birthdays. Oh Liam, just don't get all deep and tender and touch the photo...no...NO...he touches the photo!!! Then daughter wants to go to Paris. But really, she's doing all of Europe, following U2! Liam is concerned. The worlds a bad place...and U2 are a bad band! Daughter jets to Paris with airhead blonde girlfriend. They meet an ugly guy with cross eyes. The girls play music really loud and jump around and then the blonde is taken by Albanian human traffickers who were contacted by cross-eyed guy.<br/><br/>The daughter phones dad. Then she's 'taken'! <br/><br/>There is a fantastic clichéd funny scene as Liam jets to Paris. He holds the tape to his ear,listening to the kidnapper saying ""Good luck"". He pushes stop, rewind and listens again...and again. It is a side-splitting moment. Within 5 minutes of Taken, you just wish SOMEONE would whack the daughter! She is an acting vacuum and just really annoying. Aaannyway, Liam chases cross-eyed guy, who gets killed by a truck. He's lucky...he got out of this horror story early! Liam does some researching, hangs out in with an Albanian translator...then some hookers. The translator tells Liam that his daughter is at 'the construction site', which Liam finds immediately, because there is only one construction site in Paris! He doesn't find his daughter in the site brothel...but does find her hideous denim bedazzled jacket! He takes drugged girl, jacket and a gun and does some killing and car chasing. Then he saves the girl in his hotel room, with a drip full of stuff to get her over her 'Jones'. Methadone?? Liam is, if nothing else, very prepared for every situation! He starts doing lots of killing around this time. Lots! There is one hilarious scene where he challenges his bent French cop pal (who has just come home with a bread stick under his arm, because that's what French men do! Hahahaha) and Liam shoots the guys wife, then yells, ""It's just a flesh wound!!!"" as a way of chilling the French dude out! This whole movie is a flesh wound! To the brain. It is funny and it wants to be serious. It is stereotypical, racist, sexist and violent beyond need. Every character is a parody. Liam the conflicted father. The nasty bent French cop. The cold ex-wife. The innocent daughter. The nasty tattooed Albanians...all called Marco! Hahahaha<br/><br/>Liam eventually finds the daughter. She is being auctioned off. Maggie Grace tries on some method acting as if she is drugged. She fails. Maggie goes for half a million dollars! This is insanely overpriced. <br/><br/>Now some of you 'reviewers' noted that this film is important for dealing with the topical horror of human trafficking. Umm...can we stop just there? Stop reading into this film! Stop trying to wring some deeper meaning from it. It is not deep or thought provoking. If you truly thought this was a deep, profound storyline, then you are an idiot. Say it with me ""Idiot"". There. Better? Good. OK...back to the 'plot'. Liam gets the daughter...then gets knocked out! Then we find him tied up over some piping above his head. How many times have you seen this scenario?? And right on cue, the pipe snaps, Liam really snaps...and he is off on some more killing! He searches through some rooms to find his daughter. He finds lots of other girls, chained to beds...but leaves them. He finds blonde girl, but she's dead. He doesn't seem too worried about this. Tough, is our Liam! Liam then steals a car and goes on a long car chase alongside a river, to get to a boat, with his daughter on board. The daughter is found on a boat, in the arms of a fat greasy guy (the head baddies are always fat and greasy) who looks like Jabba the Hutt! Liam kills him. He kills...everyone really. Then he is calmly allowed through international customs to jet on home with his daughter. No questions asked. Oh...and there is still time to pop around to the singer to drop the daughter off for her big break! How peachy! How anyone could find this film interesting, enjoyable or original is quite frankly, probably retarded. You should probably stop watching movies and at the very least, stop writing reviews praising such a clunker!"

","After seeing the high IMDb rating of this film and reading some reviews, last night I watched this film with a friend of mine in the local theater.<br/><br/>1- Well, I think this movie deserves a 3 or 4 tops. I cannot understand why some people compare it with Bourne or even James Bond. Here goes my one star to balance the rating!<br/><br/>2- If you like a clichéd film, with a story as deep as a spoon of water with many plot holes, this movie is right for you!<br/><br/>3- The reason why I gave this film one star instead of zero is that there are actually some good acting in the film. Also zero star is not an option on IMDb, YET!<br/><br/>4- In case you are attracted to the movie because of the name of Luc Besson as the writer, I should warn you that he is not the same Luc Besson who wrote the masterpiece ""Leon"". He is another person after he apparently did a whole brain transplant a while ago! <br/><br/>5- Some say (actually I read it in one of the comments here) that Luc Besson wanted to fool the American audience and get away with the money! <br/><br/>6- What's up with that 17-year-old girl acting and running around like pre-elementary children all the time? <br/><br/>7- Why are the girls kidnapped just 10 minutes after they arrive in France? Why does the father find all bad people only one minute after he decides to chase them? You know, this kind of exaggeration ruins the film for me! <br/><br/>8- I expect that a spy (even a retired one) have some high-tech devices not just a SONY tape recorder and a walkie talkie! <br/><br/>9- In the scene when father is on the phone with her about-to-be-kidnapped daughter, Why doesn't he ask her to lock the door and call the police? yeah, I know. The French police probably doesn't care about the safety of an American girl. In fact they are probably busy helping out the Albanian gang that rule in Paris! <br/><br/>10- Why isn't the girl even a little bit sad about her friend who was raped and died? <br/><br/>One friendly suggestion for those people who described the action scenes in this film as ""jaw dropping"": You may want to see a ""jaw"" doctor! <br/><br/>OK, here ends my comment.

"lacalguy","1","58","122","27 June 2009"," Absolutely terrible
","I don't know what movie the other commentors who gave this film a favorable rating were watching, but it wasn't the one I saw. The opening dialogue between Neeson and the shop store owner made me want to puke. The storyline that Neeson's ex-wife married a rich, rich man is so old and worn out it wouldn't clean the puke that came out of my mouth watching this garbage.<br/><br/>Next, Neeson's daughter gets a pony from her step-father? Yeah, it's horse not a pony, but all I could think of watching this dribble is that a 17 year-old is excited about getting a pony. At 17, she's into boys and cars, not ponies. Also, the daughter wants to be a singer, so what happens? Neeson's buddies that night talk him into body guarding a rock singer and someone tries to kidnap the singer, which Neeson prevents. How convenient.<br/><br/>Everyone is rich in this film, except poor Liam. Neeson's wife's new husband, his daughter's girlfriend and her relatives. If you're going to kidnap someone for sex slavery, don't kidnap the rich, kidnap the poor. The rich have resources to hire people to come after you.<br/><br/>Neeson's a good actor, but sometimes he fails to deliver lines with the proper emphasis. ""It was a trailer, not a building."" Delivered totally flat.<br/><br/>Further, he shows up at the hideout impersonating a French detective and speaking in his Americanized accent. Uh, are we supposed to believe the bad guys actually thought he was French? The most interesting character in the film was the translator and he was only on screen for a few minutes.<br/><br/>Luc Besson has always been a disappointment to me and once again he shows me why. OK, the actions scenes are pretty good, but not worth the time watching this film if you like good cinema."
"robot_girl","2","30","59","14 February 2009"," Lame even by my low standards
","Poor Liam. He's ex-CIA, which we find out when all his ex-CIA friends show up at his house and start reminiscing about the old days in the CIA. How convenient that his ex-CIA buddies talk him into a bodyguard job where he heroically saves a no-name singer from being knifed to death. This allows him to not only prove his manhood and hand-to-hand combat skills, but also get the singer's business card to give to his daughter slash aspiring pop princess (not that she sings at all in the movie). Did I mention she just turned 17 and received of all things a PONY from her rich step-dad at the extravagant birthday party he threw for her? Oh, and she wants to go to Paris with her best friend. just the two of them, and needs her dad's signature on some immigration form.<br/><br/>Liam is skeptical about sending his daughter to Paris. But her mom (Liam's ex-wife) wastes no time telling us about how she hated his CIA job and can't believe Liam would be hesitant to send his daughter to Paris unescorted. I mean, what's the worst that could possibly happen to two teenage girls by themselves in Paris? How dare he be so paranoid? After all, they will be staying at her friend's cousin's house in Paris, and like most parents who send their underage daughters to Paris without adult supervision, she didn't call the cousins to ask about the arrangements. And oh, by the way, instead of just staying in Paris, they're going to be traveling all over Europe to see U2 concerts. With that kind of subplot I can't believe U2 didn't take this opportunity to include one of their songs in this movie.<br/><br/>Fast forward after a 12-hour flight and the girls arrive completely fresh in Paris. Immediately a young man approaches them and wants to share a cab to save money. How smart of the girls to accept his money-saving offer. Next thing you know, the girls get to the apartment and immediately tell the dude that they're staying there alone. Didn't their parents tell them not to talk to strangers? <br/><br/>About this time I start apologizing to my husband about how incredibly stupid this movie is. I even offered to see if we could get our money back. My only hope was that the girl get kidnapped soon so that we could get to some more exciting parts of the movie. Thank goodness the kidnapping scene was minutes away, and I admit that scene got my heart pumping. If only the rest of the movie were that good.<br/><br/>Lest we leave any clichés unturned, we now return to Liam. His dialog indicates he's flat broke, but his daughter's step-dad is rich and can send Liam to Paris on a private jet. Naturally mom and step-dad stay behind, because that's what most parents would do when their daughter is kidnapped overseas into the female slave trade. After his arrival in Paris, Liam hooks up with an old cop friend (don't *you* have any old cop friends in Paris?). Now, what kind of French character should the cop be? How about we name him Jean-Claude and have him walk home carrying a baguette? That way everyone will know he's French! <br/><br/>One thing about Liam's character: he takes no prisoners. He has no problem shooting a dude in the back of the head as he runs away. Pretty much everyone who gets in his way gets either a bullet or ""daim bramage"" from a blunt object. Given Liam's single-minded pursuit of his daughter, even innocent people are at risk. For example, it should come as no surprise that Liam would shoot a bad guy's wife in the arm to get information from him. My husband and I laughed heartily, like we might've done at that mall cop movie (which I wish we'd seen instead).<br/><br/>Miraculously, Liam remains largely uninjured despite a good 100 people shooting at him. Even Jason Bourne shows some signs of wear from time to time, but he's not rescuing his daughter from a polygamist sheik and therefore lacks Liam's bullet-proof resolve. And lest anyone worry that his daughter was robbed of her innocence, we are told via an auctioneer that she's ""guaranteed pure."" Whew! <br/><br/>I'll spare you the heartwarming tale of the daughter's rescue and homecoming. Too bad her pony didn't show up at the airport. That would've been a perfect ending."

One of their Fathers flies over, finds a guy who met the girls at the crowded LAX airport, beats him up on the spot, guy gets away, father steals a car, chases the guy, causes freeway mayhem - god knows how many innocent Americans injured and the guy gets killed by a truck. What would American Police do?<br/><br/>The French father kills a few more people - shoots at least one in the back, causes an innocent American teenager to get shot in the crossfire, deliberately shoots an entirely innocent American policeman's wife with 1st grade kids awake in the bedroom - don't worry, ""it's only a flesh wound"". Would someone call the police? What would your police do? 'Rescue' a drugged kidnapped teenage girl but don't take her to hospital - take her to a hotel room, put her in bed, perform medical procedures on her and interrogate her when she wakes. What should your police do? Finds is daughter, totally ignores the other kidnapped girls including his daughter's now dead friend, kills everyone associated with the kidnapping and then - calmly exits through American customs and flies home to a hero's welcome in France. Do you feel your country's been violated? Sure you do. Do you think innocent people have been killed by this man's recklessness? Yes you do. Should he be brought to justice? Of course. Would you give THAT film 10 stars? No way, you'd probably firebomb the theatres it's showing in.<br/><br/>But because it's an American father in a foreign country and the hoodlums are Albanian selling innocent American girls to Moslems then it's OK and he's a hero.<br/><br/>Can't you Americans see the attitude of mind that's got you in so much trouble when you invade places like Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq?"

","It's really sad that such a good actor like Liam Neeson is in this mess (for lack of a worse word). This is a typical (awfull) movie that Steven Seagal has been doing for the last 1o years or so. The movie also wasted a very interesting idea: the plot of an ex-agent trying to rescue his daughter from white slaves trafficker's is actually pretty good. If they had put better screen writers this could have been a very crude, strong and believable film - instead, they want us to believe that: 1) Neeson is sort of a Rambo-Terminator, completely indestructible; 2) the baddies are the worst shots ever seen in movie history - they miss even at point blank range; 3) there are no police or law enforcer of any kind in Paris, since no one eve stops Neeson of killing literally everyone that is in his path.

","And now producer/writer Luc Besson and director Pierre Morel present the comedy event of the year! <br/><br/>Here's the pitch: Two spoiled obnoxious teenage girls from California go to France and get kidnapped by a group of Albanians trafficking dumb tourists into sex slavery to the highest bidders--and you guessed it, one of those high bidders is a Middle Eastern sheik. But oh yeah, did I mention one of those girl's fathers just happens to be a retired Jack Bauer-style super-spy who's about reign down a sh*t-storm on the streets of Paris in order to rescue his idiot daughter? And guess what--it's Liam Neeson! <br/><br/>Yes, there is a bit of a novelty factor in watching the guy who played Oskar Schindler go against type and get crazy on these moronic dirt-bags. And gosh darn it, Liam does his best with the role. I can't remember the last time a film was sold to the American public entirely on the sound of one man's voice reading dialog. He alone makes the otherwise unbearable film watchable. However, let's be honest. As much fun as it is to watch Liam Neeson outrun a speeding car or electrocute some guy or kill a dude with a broken bottle, Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"" was a far better and more refined example of grizzled old guy ""badassery"", and it was a hell of a lot funnier, and fancy that, had a moral.<br/><br/>What we have here in ""Taken"" is tone deaf French filmmakers sticking their nose up at Americans and spreading xenophobia abroad. I'm pretty sure they thought there were making a slick black comedy that no American would see through. Had they manifested this with a harder edge or more overtly satirical tone, they might've been on to something. Instead we get a second-rate episode of ""24"" watered down by a PG-13 rating that takes away any possibility of entertainment on even an exploitative level.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Don't be fooled by Liam Neeson's voice. He commanded our attention in the teaser trailers, but this should be film not taken."

","I read some of the reviews of this movie before I watched it, and expected it to be good. Instead it was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Not even Liam Neeson could rescue it from being complete rubbish. It was riddled throughout with clichés and stereotypes, along with non-stop fights, shootings, chases and virtually everyone being killed by Neeson in his search for his kidnapped daughter. It could have been a good story if some subtlety had been used in tracking down the villains but there was none, and the ease with which he found them was laughable. in addition, the total lack of concern for any of the other girls was appalling. The ending was especially pathetic. Suddenly the daughter, after the nightmare experience she had gone through, was back to being the all-American happy teenager that she was at the start of the film. Totally unrealistic."

","""Taken"" finds the daughter of ex-CIA agent Liam Neeson kidnapped in Paris by Albanians and held for sale into the white slave trade, and details Neeson's efforts to save his daughter and her friend.<br/><br/>""Taken"" is a terrible movie. Liam Neeson is a terrible fit for the ""aggrieved parent / former CIA agent / action movie"" genre. When people applauded, I looked at Don and said, loud enough for people to hear, ""You have to be kidding me!"" Some of those near us laughed nervously — after applauding, mind you.<br/><br/>The script was literally laughable at many points. I can imagine the screenwriter sitting at home using some sort of iLife-type program  ""iHollywood Script"" or some such  to assembly this dreck from stock story elements. It is filled with cliché after cliché, often delivered by Neeson without a hint of urgency or passion. His banter with his former CIA colleagues, and his ex-wife and daughter, is, conversely, delivered with obviously false passion and good humor. He reminded me of a super-excited infomercial audience member at points.<br/><br/>There are many ""great"" (hint: sarcasm employed here) bits of dialogue throughout the film. I stifled my laughter at several points. Here, however, is the best exchange.<br/><br/>Neeson, as ""Bryan Mills,"" meets an old friend from French Internal Security. When he announces his plans to retrieve his kidnapped daughter, his French friend warns him not to ""tear down Paris"" in his pursuit.<br/><br/>""I WILL TEAR DOWN THE EIFFEL TOWER IF I HAVE TO!"" Neeson replies, again almost bloodlessly.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson turned in an excellent performance in ""Schindler's List,"" as the morally confused, yet ultimately upright, Oscar Schindler. I thought he was okay in ""The Phantom Menace,"" and I blamed any failures on his part on the directing of George Lucas (who deserves the scorn of the entire world for that series of abortions, plus his destruction of the Indiana Jones series). In ""Taken,"" however, Neeson simply wasn't up to his usual standard. I wonder if this was perhaps a ""paycheck"" movie?<br/><br/>All that being said, I enjoyed myself because this entire movie was so ludicrous and laughable. I later told a friend that it should be shown to film students as an example of how not to write a film. Further, I learned some very valuable things:<br/><br/>1. Jeeps cannot be hurt by any man-made weapon. 2. Nor can strung out, incoherent prostitutes lying in the back seat. 3. CIA agents travel with their own medical drips, needles, etc., to help bring addicts down so as to question them. 4. Albanians in France do not notice if, when claiming to be a French agent, you speak to them in slightly-British accented English. 5. You can leave France after committing multiple murders and other felonies with nary a whisper.<br/><br/>There are other lessons contained therein, of course, but these are the ones that stood out in my mind."

If you haven't seen this film and want to but don't want to know much about it then imagine a Bond/Bourne film where the character has retired from his job and now a very protective father of his daughter and you've got Taken.<br/><br/>The film is very intense and very fast paced and one of those rare films where it doesn't matter about the film length or how fast it gets into the actual story, this movie is just brilliant because of how quick it does. It grabs you at the first scene and it's like you already know the main character Brian Mills, it's like he's part of you and you know exactly how he feels. This is because of the excellent acting by Liam Neeson. The film like I said is very fast paced, there are about ten to fifteen minutes of you knowing the characters and the surroundings and then five minutes of an introduction to the quest Brian Mills heads on when his daughter is speaking to him on the phone and he hears her get kidnapped. The rest of the film is so fast paced you'd have to click the slow button to realise what is going on. The movie is just brilliant in every way and like I said at the start highly under-rated by critics and they will feel guilty of their reviews when this film turns into a classic (which in my opinion already is, the critics just haven't realised it yet). In fact I can't even say anything more about this film, there are no words to describe it and it's actually one of those rare films I give a 10/10, but the only thing I can say is...<br/><br/>... if you want to see this film then forget the bad reviews coming from mostly all critics and some public people.

","While watching Taken I was reminded of several other ""Lost Child"" films and surprisingly the one which first came to mind was Arnold Schwarzenegger's Commando. Specifically this movie is what that movie should have been like. Liam Neeson outshines Arnold with a witty and far more sympathetic and charismatic character portrayal.<br/><br/>The film's plot is simple but has enough twists and texture to make it into a fulfilling experience. The film takes many turns and even goes on the verge of moral ambiguity but Neeson's charisma pulls the film through even its more preposterous segments.<br/><br/>However, it's perhaps of the film's over-the-top nature why it will never reach the same classic and timeless status as Flightplan or Frantic. The film stands out well for its relative grittiness but also suffers slightly from it. The film is a pleasure to watch especially since it offers so many memorable moments and for once an appropriately up-lifting closure."

I don't have anything to complain about this time frame, maybe it could have been done with less Rambo stuff for realism but nevertheless pure brilliance.<br/><br/>However I really disliked begging and the end, too predictable, cliché after cliché, too mainstream.<br/><br/>But all in all, great stuff, you don't want to miss this one."

","I knew nothing of this film. I had seen B13 and almost all of Luc Besson's work, and I think he is one of the best out there. Someone told me this film is written by Besson and directed by B13 helmer Pierre, so I thought this would be just another mindless fun actioner , but good god, was i wrong or what? This is an amazing film, and running at a pace of 93 minutes, you won't even know when it started and finished, and will leave you craving for some more. The fight scenes are exhilarating, the car chases are slick, and the way in which Neeson dishes out his own brand of justice is just plain super. We had no romantic interconnections, no boring humdrum or anything to loosen our grips on the tight narrative.Even then, this ain't your usual Statham action film, Neeson is a great actor, just check out the scene when he hears his daughter screaming while being kidnapped , and his lines after that, just before the ""Good Luck"", i knew this film was gonna be kick-ass at that moment, but i never expected so much. Our Spy Neeson doesn't trails, he kills. He knows how to get revenge, and how....A bloody brilliant action movie."

","One of the best action/thriller movies in a fair while. Liam does a very good job as the lead and is very believable. He does this genre very well and is able to show the right emotions when needed.<br/><br/>There are some holes in the script but you should immerse yourself in the film and enjoy the ride. The fact he was able to find the identity of a man by saying ""good luck"" is a little out there but he needs an entry point somewhere.<br/><br/>The film should scare female back-packers from going alone in all parts of the world which is good to see as way too may go missing never to be seen again.

I didn't expect much at first but I was happily surprised at Neeson's cool but deadly approach to his 'job'.<br/><br/>Some difficult subjects are broached in this film, but they are handled very well. The plot seems to burst into life at the right points, characters are both believable and engaging. Emotionally one is held in a vice like grip throughout. <br/><br/>Never really been a Neeson fan-boy but he nails it here. I am going to watch it tonight again, and yes it's one of those that deserve a repeat visit. Cinema has a new hero: Watch out Bourne!"
"Bonecrusher27","9","5","7","22 August 2008"," Liam Neeson Kick Ass... then Kills It!
","This has got to be one of my favourite movies since The Rock. It's tone is unapologetic, and the action is hard hitting and extremely fast paced. It's been a long time since I saw bad guys being terminated so mercilessly and enjoyably. Liam Neeson is one of those people who's an actor first and everything else second, so this movie has emotion and a sense of purpose. That's something most movies that rely on just action could never have, because without a story to carry them they go flat when the action rests. Here there is a relentless drive to a definite end. Liam's acting is such that you never forget that there is a driving purpose behind it all.<br/><br/>A note on the fighting: since the Bourne series, there's been a (to me) welcome move towards using more realistic fighting systems in portraying a bit more realism. I see that the keysi system Liam learnt for Batman Begins didn't go to waste here. It's a great thing to see truly unconscionable bad guys being so brutally treated. I guess that's the magic of the make believe world of movies. You see things that you wish you'd see but know will never ever happen in real life.<br/><br/>The only thing that would have made it a bit better for me was if it had a bit more blood in it. From a fighting arts point of view, I would also have liked some wider shots to better appreciate the technicalities of some of Liam's moves. I was able to understand what he did almost all the time, but to others the cuts may be a bit too choppy and distracting. But really that's a small point that is just nitpicking."

","And the character played by Liam Neeson keeps his word. I'm reminded of another film on the subject of human slavery in our present era called Lilja 4ever, but Taken has action and tight editing that goes beyond..<br/><br/>I recommend this film of breakneck action with tension to keep your heart pumping as you follow a man's single-minded purpose, to rescue his child. The action sequences are nasty and eminently effective in portraying the kind of skills Neeson's character needs to succeed. And it's believable, too easily believable for our cynical modern world.<br/><br/>To all those who worked on this film, you did an amazing job.<br/><br/>To all those children unrescued, undocumented and abandoned by the world, I pray you somehow find peace."
"jafetbg","1","25","51","12 October 2012"," A cheap Steven Seagal remake that gives Americans a bad name
","This movie was not the work of experts, but a group of random amateurs who saw too many Steven Seagal movies and wanted to cash in on prejudices held on ""SOME"" of these actors' past successes. The IMDb score tricked me into thinking this was worth the time, but let me give feedback appropriately by mentioning the best things first and then go on to the worst parts.<br/><br/>The only good (funny) part:<br/><br/>When the protagonist contacts a previous CIA contact, that turns out to be a fraud, he shoots the man's innocent wife in the arm, in order to get information. As my bro said, she was depicted as a French housewife, whose life held no value. This was pure dark humor, that got me laughing, because this cutthroat abusive behavior is not the behavior you expect of someone (supposedly) ex-CIA, but expect of a retired pimp.<br/><br/>Then the worst parts: <br/><br/><ul><li>The disregard of all life forms that are not American. It is as though this movie hopes to accomplish complete disregard for all human life forms outside the USA, he kills so many people and ignores the suffering of so many girls that have the same age as his daughter that you end up hoping there will be some mention of these factors in the last minute of the movie. Nonetheless, in the end all that matters is the safe return of the spoiled American brat. Nobody cared for the other girls used as prostitutes, because they were not American. A note to the writer: this move plays out in France and THIS IS NOT THE MATRIX OTHER LIFE FORMS DO EXIST!!!!!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The plot. As there was none, it was all predictable if you ever saw a Steven Seagal movie, except most of those actually have some form of content... The movie The innocence of M. was a movie with a plot of a similar level.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Portrait of France. This country known for its refined culture is portrayed as a poverty stricken third world country, that happens to host the Louvre and some museums. This is confirmed by, the protagonist never considering contacting authorities and instead decides to kill all criminals he meets himself. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Credibility. Ex-CIA? Yeah right, for the sake of the USA I hope the CIA has more Intelligence... like I said, he was more like a retired pimp who's stash got busted and was out for revenge. This movie does not attempt to have you believe 10 seconds of its story line, it's all fantasy of an overexcited Steven Seagal fan. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The acting. After the first scene I hoped his daughter would just die, because this spoiled brat can't act! She sucked in Lost and still does. Furthermore, everything resembles a Steven Seagal movie, the only good actors in this movie are possibly the French female addict, he only helps because she is wearing his daughter's jacket (BTW, she gets discarded after the protagonist gets his information). Furthermore, the protagonist was mediocre at acting, he used the script as a bible and unfortunately his face only knows 3 expressions: anger, anxiety and satisfaction. But, 80% of the time he just portrayed an angry tourist.</li></ul><br/><br/>My recommendation is if you have an IQ above 45, this movie will not meet your expectations of a movie made by people with an IQ above 20. All this movie tries to inspire is to randomly kill people while you're in a foreign country on vacation or looking for your spoiled slightly retarded daughter. This piece of trash gives all Americans a bad name and does not teach anybody anything, save yourself, the time, money and breath it takes to deal with this product made by amateur American Hollywood residents without a passport."
"titan-42","8","9","15","15 July 2008"," surprisingly good movie
","IMDb is really good in telling a movie is crap, most comments on various movies will prove that. Now we come to this movie, Taken, for me, it's one of the best movies i've seen last year! I'ts got a good solid story, good cast and lot's of nicely captured action. Liam Neeson is not your average action hero but he does a great job being one.<br/><br/>Story in short; A girl goes to France and get's ""taken"" from her apartment while making a call with her dad who used to be a retired secret agent. He doesn't waste any time and goes after her in France.<br/><br/>The movie has no surprising plot turns and just goes on and on, which in this case is a good thing. Some scenes may be found shocking cos of violence and drug use/abuse. Personally i think a good balance has been found here and would like to rate it 8/10"
"secondtake","6","8","13","7 February 2010"," You will be taken once the movie lands in Paris, and then it's breathlessly fast and violent.
","Taken (2008)<br/><br/>Once the real plot kicks in and Liam Neeson goes ballistic (in his very icy, obsessed way), the movie takes off, too. With good reason. He's out to get his cute, almost innocent teenage daughter out of truly horrific danger. We feel for him, and we don't mind a lot of collateral damage in his wake. A lot.<br/><br/>Be prepared for lots of dead bodies, including men (all the deaths are men, now that I think about it) killed either gratuitously or with mindless vengeance. Neeson's character, ex-CIA man Bryan Mills, has the particular ""skills"" that give bad guys ""nightmares."" And he is skilled in a way even Matt Damon would love, just short of superhuman. (Now there's a film, Neeson vs. Damon, endless chases and almost-hits, totally breathless.)<br/><br/>I don't mean to make fun. Taken is terrific. At its best. The minute Bryan Mills lands in Paris, he is incredibly resourceful and tireless, and the writing makes every encounter a match of wits and nerve, and the editing makes every car chase truly dizzying. We really root for this guy, and cringe at the ugly, really awful underworld he finds himself deep in. And Neeson is also terrific. Besides being believable as an angry father, he's believable even as he pulls off the unbelievable feats of a super spy, showing presence and that brooding, charming depth he is known for.<br/><br/>The core of the movie--the Paris part--is less than an hour, in all, and the other plot, if you can call it that, is pretty lame. In fact, the opening scenes almost seem thrown together, either as an afterthought (to give the movie some heart) or as an edited down remnant, because it clunks along and has a whole series of logical gaffes, which aren't worth listing. Don't let this stop you. It's as if, when the girl and her friend arrive in the Parisian flat, director Pierre Morel suddenly shows up, too. Morel, in fact, is a cinematographer at heart, and that much is evident in the visual pizazz that keeps every scene popping. This is his second feature, and first in English, and we'll probably see more of his work, hopefully with a better writer in tow."

","Taken<br/><br/>It being a miserable rainy Monday morning I decided to take a half day off work and go to see Taken. Not having heard anything about this movie I didn't really know what to expect. <br/><br/>What a let-down! Do not waste your time time to go see this rubbish. Luc Blesson's writing has reached a new low, which I didn't think was possible after ""The Transporter"", you would be forgiven if you forgot that the same writer gave us the wonderfully dark ""Leon"" and equally sublime ""Nikita"". Now if ill-legal sex trafficking isn't dark enough subject matter, then it shouldn't of been approached in the blasé way that it was. I am very surprised with Liam Neeson for taking such a role. How some eastern European terrorists could actually miss Mr. Neeson, yes all 6ft 4"", while shooting machine guns defies belief.<br/><br/>With this said some of the fight sequences are well choreographed, but be under no illusions, Bourne Trilogy this ain't! The sequence of events is just implausible, you cant but help laugh.

","The plot is simple: teen-aged daughter of former spy is kidnapped while on a trip to France; he goes and finds her not without killing, maiming and generally beating the hell out of dozens of people in the process.<br/><br/>Now I could spend hours talking about the bad stuff in this movie: all characters in this movie are one-dimensional and predictable and it is no cinema master piece. It is full of clichés and stereotypes, some of which related to race or nationalities. There are plenty of vengeful, feel-good, full of that 'evil sense of justice' that evoke primal emotions (basically, every time the father beats up a 'bad guy' to ensure he gets to his daughter). So there, a paragraph was enough.<br/><br/>Having said all that, this is a great action movie. The descent into Paris' underworld; the easiness with which the 'hero' of the movie moves into and out of it; the not-so-over-the-top fight scenes; and the overall sense of accomplishment in the end, all make up for a terrific couple of hours."
"rocketdive2001","9","6","9","19 April 2009"," Surprisingly simple and effective ...
","I'll be honest. I didn't quite put this movie on my ""must watch"" list until i was invited for free to watch it with a friend. And i have to admit, i'm honestly ""taken"" into this movie! First off, it's a movie that does not have a lot of special effects. So really, if you do catch it on DVD, it's not an entire loss also, so don't worry if you're missing out.<br/><br/>The story is really simple. Father is a former government agent who retired, living away from his daughter and ex-wife. Daughter goes for a trip to Paris and gets kidnapped away in a mishap (that could have been very very easily avoided, but i won't spoil it for you), and reactivates himself to hunt down the people who did it and rescue his daughter in the process.<br/><br/>Real simple story, so it's up to Liam Neeson to keep your attention span active and in tune with things ... and i have to admit, he does a great job. I recently played and completed FALLOUT 3, a video game that he does voice acting in - as your character's father, and really, he has the magic to play the role of a father ... assuring and for sure, able to bail you out of situations even if it means risking his life. You see that a lot in Taken ... from start to end.<br/><br/>Action wise, i was told that Luc Besson is involved in this movie, yet i don't honestly feel his magical presence in this one compared to his other movies. But Liam does a nice job of being quick to attack and get the upper hand before you could even say ANYTHING. I'm convinced that he can go into the action genre from time to time ... he's got that magic! One personal comparison though ... i did compare this movie to Man on fire and it seems like between these 2 kidnap theme movies, Taken really takes a backseat to Man on fire ... but this doesn't mean it's not worth a watch ... it's just my own 2 cents and my friend feels Taken is a better movie between the 2.<br/><br/>Otherwise, just enjoy the movie!"
"Quinoa1984","7","6","9","30 January 2009"," turn off your brain for the good ""good-God-do-they-expect-me-to-believe-that"" Besson production
","On facebook there is an event coming up I believe in June which is called ""National Man Day"", which will be a day for all men everywhere to feel and act like ""Men"", whatever that is. If there are any screening rooms available for this kind of created event, Taken could be a good choice as a movie to screen. It's a preposterous action movie fantasy that has a good dosage of Jason Bourne and surprisingly, and not offensively, some conservative connotations in it. Yes, conservative: where else will we get a France-is-evil tome that also includes a sex-slave trade (which, apparently, is based on real things going on in Europe right now) complete with deflowered girls the highest marker- yes, American girls, go to France and you will be sold into the sex trade- for Albanians or whomever the immigrants are with the can-do American government bad-ass with one step removed from Jack Bauer and a penchant for torture when it suits best.<br/><br/>Sound not like your cup of manly kill-kick-ass tea? Then look away and read no more. But if you're still with this, well, you know what you're in for, sort of. This is another vehicle by Luc Besson, as writer and producer, to use Paris as a backdrop for a crazy plot designed to give whoever star it is- usually Jason Statham- a run for his money for the good of the entire audience as super-violent escapist fare. The plot, with Liam Neeson's retired government agent who has a strength comparable to both Jason Bourne and Batman having to go to France after his daughter is kidnapped along with a friend, is of not much consequences as we've seen it in other molds and folds before, sometimes in sleazy packages or straight-to-video deals (one may wonder where Chuck Norris is when you need him).<br/><br/>But the plot actually becomes a little more believable, or at least acceptable, because of or in support of the presence of Liam Neeson. He's such an underrated presence today in movies, popping up when a director has the right mind to use him (yes, he was even pretty good in Phantom Menace), and in this case director Morel and Besson have here an action hero who shows weariness and real conflict on his face. He's not the first person you'd think to play Brian, but he's the right person for what he can bring to the part. He's tough as nails but isn't chiseled or completely stone-cold like Daniel Craig. There's something else going on, like he's thinking and makes us think with him as he crashes through glass and kicks and punches and shoots and strangles and bamboozles dozens of gangsters and baddies. He helps make Taken something of a wonderful contradiction: believably unbelievable all the way through. You know this guy can do these things because, frankly, he just can.<br/><br/>As my own mother, God bless her, said after seeing the movie: it gives a good enema to the brain. She meant that as a compliment, I suppose."

Seeing this movie in the theater, you begin to get a taste of what is to come with previews of other movies before the feature starts.

Nowhere do you find absurd behavior more prevalent than in soap operas.<br/><br/>With all of the jumping, kicking, flying around and bullets, where are the female actors? Have we not reached an age where women are also the action heroes in movies? Would it not have been interesting to see the mother, an ex-CIA officer face down those bad guys? She would have really let them have it. So, is this a movie about human trafficking or action adventure? And why is it that all of the boys get to play with the cars and guns?

","I pay £12.99 a month so that I can go to the cinema and see as many films as I wish. That said I won't waste my time and watch any rubbish, so I usually use reviews and websites such as this one to evaluate whether a film is worth my valuable time. A decent score for ""Taken"" on IMDb was countered by a one star review on Empire, stating that the film was ""A venomous little actioner that mistakes bile for adrenaline."" Having now seen the film for myself I can only suggest the reviewer had arrived home after putting the family pet down only to discover his wife in bed with his brother, best friend and a menagerie of farmyard animals or maybe the reviewer just doesn't dig action films. I write that because if you like action films, you are very likely to love this. It has action scenes that rival (almost feel borrowed) from the Bourne trilogy as Bryan (Neeson) pursues his daughter through the seedy criminal underworld in Paris stopping at nothing to recover his daughter. He leaves a lot of people on the floor in his efforts and it was slick, quick and violent. Superb if you like the genre. Still good if you don't. The film deals with some sensitive issues and will leave you thinking about them for a while after. We do have a tendency to have our heads in the clouds and forget that truly horrible things are happening all over the world and people good and bad are being bought and sold. Difficult to believe on this evidence Neeson is 56, what he most definitely is, is a very talented and very versatile actor. He moves from a caring father to a menacing deadly weapon in an extremely believable manner. It is the best action/revenge film I have seen in a long time- sometimes you have to judge for yourself and not base your decisions on other people's opinions- I have Empire to thank for that."

This aloofness no doubt is to prove her devotion for the new rich husband in her gold-digging life played to scintillation by ex-""X-Men"" Famke Jenssen.<br/><br/>When Kim wished to go to Paris, Bryan's old war-horse alarms tingled and he ignored them at the pressure of his former spouse to show his daughter he was not uptight, big mistake! Luckily, Bryan made sure Kim carried a roaming mobile which was essential when she got abducted by Albanian smugglers - all he had was the MP3 of their voices and he kept replaying to learn their voices and other clues.<br/><br/>Neeson's calmness yet underscored with a leonine ferocity far blew away any previous notions of his playing a college professor type!

Just hide under the bed and wait for it to happen. If they cannot find you in the first instance please say something. 3) If your daughter is kidnapped, threaten to kill the kidnapper. (Straight out of the negotiators handbook). 4) It is not safe outside the US. You cannot lock an apartment in Paris. Especially one in a posh neighborhood (codes at the entrance, anyone? Luc Besson must have spent some time in Paris???). 5) Women trafficker prefer rich tourists. Nobody notices their disappearances. 6) If your Stepfather is rich you can still save money by sharing a cab with a complete stranger overseas. 7) Be polite with a blond girl and she will want to go to bed with you. 8) Virgins are worth saving, the others deserve to be raped and killed"
"guy-95","2","20","40","25 June 2011"," A nasty piece of work
","It's difficult to believe that any Europeans were involved in the making of ""Taken"", least of all someone reasonably smart, like Luc Besson. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson's character is clearly an over-protective dad, but he's also someone whose CIA past means that he knows how dangerous the world can be. Is he justified in his anxiety about letting his daughter travel to Paris (yes, not Damascus, Kinshasa or Caracas - Paris)? Of course it is. His daughter and her friend are barely out of the airport when they're abducted by swarthy types (clearly a daily occurrence at Charles de Gaulle). And do these bad guys seek to ransom the clearly very wealthy young women? Mum, Famke Jannsen, and her new fella have got to be good for a few million. No, it makes better financial sense to get the prom queens addicted to heroine and sell them into the sex trade (apparently Eastern European women cost too much to transport?).<br/><br/>Clearly Europe is also a place where venal corruption goes to the top, plus it's just a short walk from... the Middle East. Keep your daughters safe, America! Fortunately foreign laws don't apply to U.S. citizens, so anyone even tangentially involved in the kidnapping is welcome to a bullet in the back. Problem solved.<br/><br/>One of the most xenophobic films I've seen in a long time, clearly intended to reinforce American distrust of Europe and loathing of the East. Its moral compass is so absurdly right-wing it might persuade Harry Callahan to vote Democrat."

","Each time you see a lousy film, you think nothing could possibly be worse until along comes something that blows the previous one out of the water for sheer awfulness. This is true of 'Taken'. Up to pres, it is the worst pile of junk I've had the misfortune to sit through in quite some time. Quite simply I am outraged that this should score so highly on IMDb and that I should have been taken in by it! Liam Neeeson goes through this looking like some badly made -up corpse, gaunt old features emphasized by an appalling hair-dye job, calculated to make him look younger and perversely emphasizing his age. Lousy script, lousy acting -the worst of which being the daughter who behaves like a demented 6 year old rather than a 17 year old asking to tour Europe. Why would anyone allow an obviously backward/retarded girl to do this? This film absolutely STINKS - it is utter RUBBISH!!!!!! Dozens of gangsters firing automatic weapons at one man and all missing the target etc.. the usual clichés, in fact its so bad its like a parody. Only watch this if you are a particularly unsophisticated/immature 15 year old boy because that's the only type of person who could possibly enjoy this garbage. Everyone has to pay their bills and Liam Neeson must have seen this as a way to pay his, because my God- he can't seriously have thought 'I've just GOT to play this role!' when the script landed on his mat! TRASH that hits a new low for the braindead."
"jedalton33","6","13","24","1 February 2009"," Both terribly good and terribly bad
","The spy-thriller film genre is a favorite of mine, has been since I first saw Connery's James Bond in Goldfinger as a young boy. In my late teens I was introduced to Jason Bourne and my liking of the genre was decidedly solidified.<br/><br/>I like Luc Besson (his Leon is an all-time favorite of mine), and The Fifth Element was a breath of fresh air that mixed elements sci-fi, humor, horror, and suspense in a wonderfully well-balanced and entertaining way (not to mention that it had Milla Jovovich in it...).<br/><br/>After hearing almost nothing but heated enthusiasm for this movie, I finally saw it last night. Honestly, I wanted to fall in love with this film. Liam Neeson is a splendid actor, and I've liked nearly all of his efforts to date. His character in this movie is an ex-spy whose dedication to his former career spelled a divorce for him and an estrangement from his now teenage daughter who he dearly loves. Of course, the title of the film lets us know what the movie is about. The movie's plot elements are awfully tired as they've been overused to agonizing redundancy in countless films, but hey okay, it's supposed to be really good, has Liam Neeson in it, and after all, it's a spy-thriller, right? Well...<br/><br/>I won't give any details away here. Suffice it to say that parts of this movie had me cheering and hyper-adrenalized, but conversely, parts of it had me rolling my eyes as I sat through scenes that were laughably implausible, unbelievably predictable, and, acting-wise, downright wooden. There are no surprises in this movie. While Jason Bourne was a bad-ass spy that we expected to mess people up, his character was complex and all three films in the Bourne Trilogy featured intelligent plot twists, good acting, and decent scripts. The same cannot be said of this movie. Taken reveals some of the most pathetic acting, annoying characters, and mindless Hollywood drivel I've seen in a long time. But...<br/><br/>It's entertaining, to say the least. Actually, if you can shut half of your brain down, it's quite good. Just don't expect anything you haven't seen before. The early scenes in which Neeson seeks (and gets) delicious revenge are excellent, yes. But although he always destroys his enemies, the freshness of his victories becomes absent before half the movie is over. You'll see why. For the most part, Taken is a repetitive, one-dimensional, and mind-numbingly unrealistic movie. Too bad. With a little more ingenuity and all-around versatility it could have been great. The bottom line: Taken is a movie that is both terribly good and, yes, terribly bad."

"RatedVforVinny","7","2","2","28 February 2020"," A pure popcorn, action feature.
","This is a very hard one to review as I can see why it's loved by so many. On the plus side, it contains the swiftest direction by Pierre Morel and a production by the king of action films himself Luc Besson. The film seems to just breezes through the gears. Also the star Liam Neeson gives almost a perfect performance, as an ex C.I.A agent out to recapture his taken daughter. On the negative side, the plot is so far fetched you have to stifle the laughs and at many a point. The way the central character takes on (single handed), the most one dimensional Albanian gangsters is almost laughable; whilst (simultaneously) taking out the whole of the French Intelligence service. 'Taken' though proved to be both very successful and highly influential (spawning two sequels and countless imitators). On the downside, since the original 'Taken' Liam Neeson himself, has become more typecast than Daniel Craig as James Bond but the upside is of course, the most lucrative of acting roles."

","The first half hour of this film is the set up. It's difficult which person is more detestable - Neeson's ex-wife for playing the part of the narcissistic, condescending b-word or the daughter for being the self-obsessed, over the top, annoying spoiled teenage brat. You hope either or both get offed and quickly. But it doesn't turn out that way because Neeson cares about both of them, including holding the candle for the ex for reasons that aren't clear.<br/><br/>What follows is some action porn as the daughter gets taken and it's time for Neeson to spring to action with his ""special set of skills."" He does a very good job of playing the action hero with superior skills and also capable of making the bad guys miss every time, including with their automatic weapons. As poor as this film should be, Neeson somehow carries it the rest of the way which is about 50 minutes of sheer action and pretty fast paced fun. <br/><br/>Some didn't like the political ploy of using the bad morals of the middle east to portray. Bear it or go to one of those countries and you'll begin to accept the sad reality that things like this aren't really that far fetched as crazy as that may seem and might be a little over the top.<br/><br/>Overall this gets all the stars for fun action. The dialogue during the set up is laughable and painful. But the last 50 minutes make it fun. Don't worry if you make dinner during the first thirty and then enjoy the best part. This one is all Neeson."

By using his honed skills, he does his utmost to track down the perpetrators and bring his daughter home.

But it is fresh in screenplay which took off really fast (within first 15 minutes or so).<br/><br/>The biggest positive is Liam Neeson - he carries the movie on his shoulders ,although doing some unbelievable stunts, one can engage in them as the movie shows the activities which actually happen in real world.

Liam Neeson is very good here, (somebody said to me ""why would someone like Liam Neeson wan to get himself involved in something as nasty and insane as that"" I disagree) and is most of the reason the movie works.<br/><br/>If it was a Sly Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger type of action hero cast as Mills, you would have expected the violent action scenes that followed the kidnapping with the hero coming out unscathed. With Neeson, you never know what will happen. And his ""Certain set of skills"" speech would have appeared cheesy, corny and predictable. Here it's cold, measured and utterly brilliant. <br/><br/>Famka Jenssen and Holly Valance are also here and both are OK."

","Imagine having Liam Neeson as your sworn adversary. Imagine Neeson being a seasoned bodyguard and well trained by the American government to track down people like you that don't want to be found. Imagine he's got nothing left to lose in his life but his daughter, and that Neeson doesn't care about anything but her. Now imagine you just kidnapped her. Good luck. Taken is a 2008 action/crime drama directed by Pierre Morel that shows you exactly what happens to you when you kidnap Brian Mills' (read: Liam Neeson's) seventeen year-old daughter, played by Maggie Grace during her vacation abroad to Paris with her nineteen year-old friend Amanda, played by Katie Cassidy. This thrilling tale of a father's complete and utter devotion to his daughter will captivate audiences as they witness his genius yet violent quest to rescue his daughter from human traffickers.<br/><br/>After Brian Millis retires from his job as a CIA agent doing bodyguard work, he moves to California to be with his daughter, Kim, who he barely saw when she was growing up. Now as a seventeen year-old, Kim and her mother Lenore (Famke Janssen) convince Millis to allow her out of the country for what he thinks is a multiple week stay in Paris with Kim's friend Amanda and Amanda's family from Paris. Too late Millis finds out that Kim's trip is actually a Europe-wide tour of the band U2. Shortly after arriving at the airport, the two teens meet a friendly, handsome man who finds out where they are staying and invites them to a party. Unfortunately for the girls, there never is any party. Within fifteen minutes of getting to their cousin's apartment (who actually are away at the time) a bunch of thugs break in and kidnap Amanda and head for Kim. Fortunately, Brian is on the phone with her at the time, so he hears the whole thing and begins his trek to find his daughter.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson definitely plays his role well. His character becomes this one-track mind Terminator-style character that stops at nothing to find his daughter. The movie goes into great detail of explaining that she is the only aspect of life he cares for anymore, so his focused and vengeant personality reflects this deep paternal care as he struggles to find his daughter deep in the heart of Paris.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. It is definitely focused on an older crowd; not only is violence a heavy emphasis, the theme of a father caring this much about his daughter will definitely strike a chord in more parents than teens. The premise of an ex-CIA using his skills to save his daughter is believable and is really cool too. The action scenes are also very crisp. Each one shows Neeson as a careful and calculated killer who is able to take down any man due to his CIA training. Overall, I'd rate Taken a 9/10. While the scenery could have been better, the plot and Neeson's character more than make up for this shortcoming."

","The movie Taken is about a father named Brian whose daughter is kidnapped by a sex trafficking organization in Europe. It starts with Brian shown as a single dad who has just recently quit his job as a CIA agent to be closer to his daughter. He goes to his daughter's seventeenth birthday party at his exwife's husbands house. The husband is extremely rich and gets her a horse overshadowing Brians present of a karoke machine. In his absence his daughter seems to have become very attached to material objects. She plans to go on a tour of Europe following around a rock band but lies to Brian about it and says she is only going to France for vacation. Her father knows of the hazards of traveling internationally and is hesitant to let her go. He initially says no and his daughter is taken by a sex trafficking organization. The movie is about him tracking down the people who captured his daughter, killing all of them and getting her back. Taken and it has and is one of my favorite movies that I have ever seen. The action scenes with Liam Nesson are outstanding and the story is entertaining. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Liam Nesson seems to play the father role in many films and there is a reason, he plays it extremely well. He reminds me of my father slightly being a sinister and caring guy, this helped me to have a deeper connection with the movie. The action alone however is not the reason that Taken is one of my favorite movies of all time, the aspect of the movie that was especially evident was the devotion and dedication to his daughter that Brian showed. It proved to me that one man can really make a difference if he possess the skills and the work ethic to do so. It also taught me the depth at which a man can love something. Brian truly showed that it is possible to love someone or something so much that they would go to the end of the world and back to save them. Brian went through some incredible hardships because he cared for his daughter and it is something that I envy and hope that my father would do the same for me. It connects to a book I recently read, Half the Sky and shows the difference between the importance of a daughter in America and the importance of girl children in third world countries. The amount Americans care about their own I think it was separates our country from the rest. If I were to rate this movie out of 10 I would give it a 9."

","Taken gives a dark insight on the unfortunate reality that is human trafficking. <br/><br/>Before watching Taken, I had a general idea that human trafficking was apparent in the world, but not to this degree. While watching this movie, I became perplexed at the idea that any average person could potentially become abducted if they are not careful. Bryan is a father, and ex-CIA agent. His daughter Kim is a rebellious teenager who wants to be a singer when she grows up. When Kim asks her father if she can go to Paris to go museum hopping with her best friend Amanda and her cousin, Bryan is extremely reluctant to let her go. Bryan understands the dangers of the world from his work experience, however he eventually caves in and lets her go. While they are at the airport Bryan discovers that Kim is actually going to Paris to follow U2's European tour, and he is even more alarmed. <br/><br/>Upon Kim and Amanda's arrival in Paris they meet a handsome boy who offers to split the cost of a taxi with them because it is so expensive. Little do the girls know that this man would come back to abduct them in a short while after they settle in their apartment. This was extremely interesting because everyone has an idea of human trafficking, but no one really knows how it happens or how easy it is to be abducted. While there are definitely people who are going to say ""Oh, I would never fall for that!"" in the heat of the moment turning down a normal person who is seemingly trying to be friendly would be extremely difficult.<br/><br/>Taken is a great movie for anyone looking for action, interesting plot, or if you just love to see Liam Neeson be awesome. This movie really opened my eyes to the reality of human trafficking, and how crazy the people are to be doing this to people. Drugs, brainwashing, and flat out hopelessness fuel the fire for the human traffickers in this movie, and it leads to some extremely unfortunate situations. After watching Taken, I can honestly say that I am genuinely more aware of the world, because human trafficking is a very real thing. Girls are taken every hour of every day, and it Taken does a perfect job of portraying the heart wrenching emotions involved at every level of human trafficking, and is definitely worth the watch."

","If you want to sit back, and watch some real justice in a film, Taken is a truly refreshing and rewarding experience to view. It's back to the basics. A ruthless, believable (to an extent at least) hero kicking bad guy ass. No gadgets, no one liners, just doing what needs to be done in fine style. Seeing a man fight to get his daughter back is so much more rewarding than watching someone try to save the world, or something to that effect, because a) it's believable and b) because we can relate to it, perhaps not directly, but certainly to a larger extent than the world being in danger.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is in outstanding form carrying the movie from start to finish. His slick tone, mixed with well performed stunts, result in the creation of a simply magnificent character. I have no doubt Daniel Craig will be watching this performance a few times through before beginning work on the next Bond flick.<br/><br/>The movie is of course not without flaws. It would of been nice to see one of the villains challenge Neeson's character fractionally more rather than just standing there like a lifeless dummy while Neeson did as he pleased with them. Also the escape when he gets caught seemed far too straight forward and basic to be in the least bit satisfying. There must have been a more stylish way to handle the escape than simply having him pull the pipe from the ceiling.<br/><br/>Nevertheless Taken certainly has a lot more things going for it than against it and this is why it is proving to be such a popular film. I'm disappointed it took me this long to see it and I'll say if you haven't caught it yet and are perhaps on the fence as to whether to watch it, have no second thoughts about seeing it. You won't be let down. And let us just hope no sequel is ever made. This is without doubt a film that will be best left as is with nothing added to it."

","We went up to the theatre at her behest. I asked what she had thought about seeing. Taken was the first movie she mentioned. I quickly kissed her after saying ""great minds think alike"". I had been intrigued by the film's trailer. I like good action movies and think Liam Neeson is a very competent actor. Liam Neeson plays a retired ""preventor"" who has moved to Los Angeles to spend more time with his daughter. His ultimate goal is to see if she will live with him while going to school. He spent much of her childhood away from home doing things he can't discuss in polite company. Neeson's character never goes into detail about exactly what he has done. The only glimpse we get into his former life at the onset are bits and pieces of ""war stories"" some former colleagues share around a game of cards and at the dinner table. The film starts slowly. We are shown that Bryan Mills is a meticulous, detailed man. He lives modestly and quietly (but then, all deadly good guys do, in the movies). When offered the opportunity to earn a little extra income on a one night security job, we see that Mills (Neeson) is a quick-thinking and fast moving adversary who is very good at what he does (or used to do). His moonlighting provides him with an opportunity to provide a very unique gift to his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) whom he would do anything for. Before he has the chance to surprise her, she surprises him by asking permission to travel outside of the U.S. with a friend and go to Paris. Bryan is very reluctant to let a 17 year old girl travel with her friend to Paris, unchaperoned. He knows how dangerous the world can be from first hand experience. After much consideration, and belittling of his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) he agrees to let his daughter go, with conditions. As soon as the girls arrive in Paris, they are targeted by an overly friendly stranger for abduction. During one of the films most harrowing moments, Bryan listens on the phone as his only daughter is kidnapped by strangers over 6,000 miles away. ""Hey, you told us half the movie !!!"" No, I only told you about the first 20 minutes. After that, you (and Mills) are off...AND RUNNING ! After (during) her abduction, Bryan Mills turns into an older Jack Bauer. For those who understand this reference, I can all but guarantee... you are going to like this movie. I liked this movie a lot. Not too deep, but its an action movie that does not disappoint.<br/><br/>What I liked : Fast-paced, believable action. As I said, he turns into Jack Bauer. Single-minded, decisive...and deadly. If you want to see the bad guys get better than they give, you'll be smiling and laughing (while on the edge of your seat) for most of the movie. Great acting by all involved. Every character is played well. You don't go too deep into anyone, even Mills or his daughter. But you are totally into the story. Credible. Mills is not Superman. He relies on friends, his wits, his experience, and his training. He overcomes setbacks...all while a short clock is ticking. Almost none of it reminded me that I was ""watching a movie"". <br/><br/>What I didn't like : It's PG-13, and I am going to guess it had to undergo some cuts to keep it from being rated R. Foul language, violence (although nothing ""graphic"") and its subject matter makes this one not for kids anywhere near 13. This is a movie about the real and disgusting world of human trafficking. There is no nudity, but there are several girls who appear to be teenagers in little more than lingerie. Fast cuts. As I have stated before, they keep making action movies like music videos. There are a lot of jump cuts and shaky cameras (especially during car chases) that jolt you a little more than needed. THUMBS UP! My wife enjoyed it, and so did I. I mentioned that I saw it to a few people I worked with, who as it turns out, had also seen it and gave it high praise."

","In the long line of espionage/rouge-agents genre, you have varying qualities. Arguably one of the greatest may be the Bourne trilogies, which are in themselves films of very good caliber. Then you have the opposite end of the spectrum, such as the cliché crapfest that was ""Salt"". ""Taken"" manages to stand quite nicely amongst these films, above all else due to the presence of Liam Neeson. He plays a role we are familiar with, but Neeson never lets his audience down. His acting keeps the emotional aspect of the film intact, and fine I suppose Famke Janssen as well. I also highly enjoyed Oliver Rabourdin in the film. The movie's obvious focus is action, and it does this superbly. There are many well choreographed fight scenes and believe it or not they stay well within the walls of realism for the most part. The plot has a nice pace to it, and the uglier side of reality is seen throughout the film as it displays the gruesome nightmare of the sex slave industry.<br/><br/>I recommend the extended version for more ass-kicking, and definitely catch this one."

","According to movies, Paris is not safe anymore on the first day you get there! First, kidnappers took Harrison Ford's wife in ""Frantic""; now they took Liam Neeson's daughter and her friend in the action thriller film ""Taken"", where both girls will be sold as prostitutes by Albanians slave traders. But instead of a vulnerable doctor like the one presented in Polanski's film, our hero is a former CIA agent with skillful tactics that goes to rescue his daughter from the evil. <br/><br/>Among the favorable points of this film, besides a great performance by Neeson, is the way this father manages to save his daughter and the techniques he uses to track her last steps after being kidnapped. Small things that makes a total difference like hearing the traders conversations on the phone or even asking his daughter before she was taken to mention a few characteristics of these people (but this moment fails a little if one considers the impossibility of someone doing so since she was very distressed, and how come these guys show up without wearing masks which would make impossible their recognition?). Of course, some of these things are pure exaggeration but as long as the film played with some tension, nice action sequences and a solid drama involving human trafficking and all the desperation of the main character, we are thrilled with a above the average flick.<br/><br/>A few things could be worked better or played more fairly and that is 1) the editing, because we need to know who is beating who. The fights are great, Neeson is very believable in doing all this and writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen provided to the main character lots of combat with Nagasu Do, a interesting and mixed martial art style, but the director, editor and the camera went all nuts and they wouldn't allow us to see precisely what was going on in key moments; 2) the cold-blooded character played by Neeson and his coldness didn't work at some moments, most notably where he shoots at a woman trying to discover where one of the traders were. This was something surprisingly strange to see it, didn't work so good, and this kind of implacability works better in a Bond film or a Schwarzenegger type of film (and ""Taken"" resembles ""Commando"" a little bit). It is comprehensible in the context used for this film, here's a desperate father trying to save his daughter in a short period of time, he did way worst to the guys who took her but for some reason this was too strange, and this woman wasn't even involved in the whole situation although her husband was.<br/><br/>It might be an overdone and clichéd picture but it has a lot of good things to show, it's well made, well acted with a nice supporting cast with names like Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, Leland Orser, Jon Gries and Xander Berkeley, and the action is great. 9/10"

","Yes, we've seen the Paris scenery many times before, with the likes of The French Connection, Ronin and more recently The Bourne Identity.<br/><br/>Fortunately, we were saved the whole driving-the-wrong-way cliché they often throw in there, quite uselessly, as the French and Americans both drive on the wrong side of the road anyway!<br/><br/>Yes, I freely admit that Taken takes a huge hunk of the slams and bangs from the aforementioned Bourne Identity.<br/><br/>And yes, Taken is iterative rather than innovative — Liam Neeson paying the bills rather than aching for any accolades.<br/><br/>But still, I find Taken to be an irresistible smash-and-grapple feel-good movie, up there with the surprisingly good Walking Tall — you really are rooting for Bryan, living every kick, crack, snap, shot, punch and grimacing, withering body blow.<br/><br/>I have to wonder if Kim (played by Maggie Grace) could have been any more irritating, and any less convincing as a teenager. Probably not.<br/><br/>Why did Bryan (Neeson) take the hair sample from the broken mirror? I've seen this film three times now and I don't recall him making use of the sample.<br/><br/>Neeson does a Connery and fails to hide his thick accent, but scores points for at least trying.<br/><br/>And the less said about the photo enhancement the better (you can't catch a reflection of yourself straight on when you're taking a photograph of someone else at an angle).<br/><br/>All that aside, I really like Taken.

But more than anything I loved the way Liam Neeson has portrayed the role of a protective father. Being a father myself, I could feel the pain in his eyes. He completely overshadows everything and everyone in this movie. Absolutely breath-taking!! Another aspect of this movie that I loved is that it has its heart at the right place.

The movie depicted the love of a father where he will go all ways and means to rescue his beloved daughter (Child). I think the movie is trying to depict that love story between a father and daughter. it uses lots of 'cold' humor and action to cover that lovey-dovey stuff we see in dramas.<br/><br/>I like every bit of the action, and Liam Neeson, although old, has that charisma to pull this one off pretty well. The ways the baddies are dealt with are with no-nonsense bang on their head, no second chances and I liked that style of action because it leaves no room for the bad-guys who will overthrow the good at the later part of the story.<br/><br/>I watched it with my colleague and they said it's good.

"TOMASBBloodhound","9","2","2","26 July 2009"," The Bourne Paternity
","I'll bet Neeson's Bryan Mills character could beat the crap out of Jason Bourne. Talk about an over-protective father figure! Too bad most of the young ladies kidnapped for real in this world don't have a father like this guy.<br/><br/>With each film he makes, Liam Neeson is becoming more and more likable. In fact there has never been a part he's played that I wasn't totally comfortable with him being there. Except the time he played a Kansas sheriff in some Steve Martin movie... the name of it escapes me. It wasn't a great film. But Taken certainly is! It requires great and skillful movie-making to present us so many unbelievable elements, and still keep us begging for more. Neeson is a former CIA agent who has to fly to Paris on very short notice after his daughter and a friend are taken hostage moments after arriving on a vacation. He was against the trip from the start, but eventually he gave in to the pressure from bitchy ex-wife Famke Janssen. After all, her husband gave the girl some champion thoroughbred for her birthday, and all Neeson could afford was a tiny Karaoke machine! If he says no about this trip, his daughter may never speak to him again.<br/><br/>Neeson arrives in Paris and just about tears the city apart looking for his daughter and her kidnappers. Not only a world class ass kicker, this man is also very technically proficient and in no time has this coven of sleazy Albanian immigrants on the run. Since the daughter is a virgin, she is to be sold off to a wealthy sheik! It is estimated that Neeson has only 96 hours to find her! Can he do it?? As many people understand, the film is not at all plausible. And its makers must know this. So instead of many thought-provoking scenes, the film treats us to several fights, car chases, shootouts and whatever else keeps an action movie rolling. The film touches on the dreary practice of the sex trade, and even though the film is PG-13, we get a good sense of how disgusting that world is. Neeson is exceptional as always. A skillful boxer in his early days, now he uses martial arts and makes them look good. He, like Jason Bourne can knock just about anyone out with a couple quick and perfectly placed shots to the head or neck. This film was a huge box office hit, but unfortunately for Neeson, his wife passed away in a terrible skiing accident about the time it was in theaters. My condolences go out to him, and also my congratulations on making a wonderful action film. 9 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."
"king_of_the_jungle_jive","9","2","2","26 July 2009"," well acted role by Liam Neeson
","This is a straightforward action movie. For a guy who was already 55 when it was filmed, Liam comes across as pretty darn tough. I credit the camera work/editing and also the fight choreographer. They make Liam look well-trained and lethal - quick to kill without unnecessary effort. For an older man, he compares very well with the new James Bond persona - no-nonsense, gritty, deadly.<br/><br/>The plot could have used a few more minutes of run time to solidify with some more development. There are too many convenient, lucky breaks - like finding his daughter's jacket, recovering a witness who remembers a key location, etc. - the usual shortcomings one must be willing to overlook to enjoy this kind of film.<br/><br/>But on the whole it is a very satisfying movie with a high body count of easy-to-identify bad guys. Loads of action - the obligatory fast car scenes, but almost everything else involves killing. Lots of dead bad guys, realistically done - blood as necessary but no gratuitous gore. Very watchable."
"meeza","9","2","2","20 July 2009"," What a take!
","As I finally woke up to the sleeper action movie hit of the year ""Taken"", I was taken by surprise on how immensely entertaining this narrative is. Sure it does incorporate various faux action tactics by the lead action character, but you know what? I'll take it! Liam Neeson stars as retired CIA Agent Bryan Mills who might be the best of the action heroes to arrive in the cinematic millennium. It's not so what Mills can do, is what he cannot do. He is sharp, cerebral, dynamic, skilled, swift just to give you a few takes on his strengths. Mills' CIA training definitely comes in handy when his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is what else ""taken"" on a Paris vacation by an Albanese gang for slave trade. Thereafter, Daddy Mills puts on his vengeance suit and off to Paris he goes to rescue his daughter and take down the malos. Does the Mills prevail? Well, I can't take that away from you by providing you the answer. You are going to take it all in cinematic stride by watching ""Taken"". Director Pierre Morel excelled in orchestrating action sequences in ""Taken"" with his rapid style. Sure no CIA agent could realistically be as skilled as Mills and sometimes his marvel proficiency seemed more illusory than authentic. But we could say the same for ""Die Hard"" machismo John McClane and many other infamous action heroes. So we should all take it with a grain of salt, and ask ourselves ""Is this plain action movie fun?"" I sure thought so! I am glad the protagonist role was taken by veteran actor Liam Neeson! He was, to simply say it, ""kick ass"" as Mills. ""Taken"" will not capture everyone, especially those nitpicking critics, but I was sure taken in on this 90 minute action entertainment ride. OK, that was my last take for the compelling ""Taken"". ***** Excellent"
"overcranked","9","2","2","15 July 2009"," Great Action Movie!
","Taken is an action movie which really does justice to the genre—it avoids shallow Hollywood excesses (like ridiculous explosions, expensive cars, and half-naked women) and really focuses on creating a serious, moving piece of cinema. The premise itself is very simple and even conventional, but it works. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), a former secret service agent, employs his highly developed set of skills to find and rescue his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), who has been kidnapped and sold into the Albanian slave trade while on a visit to Europe.<br/><br/>The film's premise is set up in what feels like the first ten minutes of the movie, and, while the background story and character development seem rushed, the intention is made clear: the movie is about the events that follow—about one man's unrelenting hunt both for his daughter and for revenge upon her kidnappers.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is a perfect cast for the role of Bryan Mills. He calm, stern, and almost dispassionate in the way he works, bitterly vowing to find and kill the kidnappers. It is clear from the outset that he is ruthlessly professional, a legacy of his training as a government spy. Every move made by Bryan Mills is cold and calculated, which means that the movie never drifts into cliché shootouts where one man infiltrates some warehouse and manages to evade the bullets of countless attackers. Instead the movie's writers respect the viewers' intelligence and opt for a more inventive plot which revolves around Bryan Mills abilities and deadly efficiency. Another point to be made about the writing is that—despite the one against hundreds odds—the viewer never has to suspend their disbelief. Never did I find myself saying ""yeah, right"" under my breath, and for that matter, neither did I find myself yelling at Bryan Mills or thinking how he could have done things differently. The plot is very, very believable.<br/><br/>Credit must also be given to the director, Pierre Morel, in this regard. It comes as no surprise that the Morel has worked mostly as a cinematographer, as much of the action and fighting is realistic and almost palpable at times. The camera angles, the choreography, and even the sound effects have a gritty, arresting quality to them (in a way that surpasses the Bourne movies), and much of the directing is something foreign to big screen action flicks.<br/><br/>What Taken accomplishes is the best kind of cinematic experience, with refreshingly believable fight sequences, a clever and engaging plot, and some great acting from Liam Neeson. While the movie's subject may be lacking in originality, it taken the best aspects of the action genre and reinvigorated them with a bold sense of realism.<br/><br/>Written by Anton for www.overcranked.net"

","Liam Neeson is a retired CIA action man, whose wife has abandoned him for a rich creep, and the couple are spoiling his 17 year-old daughter and driving a wedge between him and the girl. The girl has foolish spoilt brat rich friends and is persuaded by a featherhead named Amanda to travel to Paris with her, which Neeson tries to prevent but cannot. As soon as the silly girls arrive, they are spotted at the airport by Albanian gangsters who provide girls for captive, drugged prostitution and sell the prettiest into the white slave trade. Naturally, the girls are kidnapped, and Neeson's daughter being especially pretty is destined for the harem of one of those corrupt Arab sheikhs we all love to hate, this sheikh having a luxury boat docked at the quays of the Seine in the heart of Paris. Neeson moves into action mode, rushes to Paris, knowing he has only 96 hours to save his daughter before she vanishes forever. 'I have special skills', he says, and that's for sure. He starts tearing Paris apart, kills lots of disgusting Albanian gangsters (can't somebody do that for real, please?), and is generally unstoppable. Nor can we catch our breath, what with all the emergencies, chases, fights, murders, and fantastic tension. Neeson is brilliant at this role, giving us the impression he was born with an automatic in his hand and held his mother at gunpoint demanding his first suck. This is a very, very exciting movie. It is also incredibly horrifying, because the extended cut on the DVD shows all the young girls lying drugged on beds in rows, with men queuing up to rape them after buying tickets! Alas, I fear this all really goes on, but without Neesons to stop it. The ultimate organiser of the high-level sales of girls to sheikhs is a suave member of Paris society who lives in a huge mansion with parties for hundreds of people but with kidnapped girls being sold at auction in the basement while unknowing socialites drink their champagne upstairs. This theme must have come from co-writer Luc Besson, who is well aware of the rotten state of much of the French power elite. Indeed, French political and commercial corruption is an increasingly urgent theme in films made or written by French cinema makers these days, as 'Tell No One' showed so powerfully (see my review of 'Ne le Dit à Personne'). You have to be strong to see the extended cut of this one."

My only 3 real complaints: 1) After substantially reducing Paris' population it seems hard to believe Neeson would be allowed to simply return home like any tourist. 2) Who ended steering the boat when Neeson took out every living soul on it?, 3) How did the Sheik know exactly which of the 3-4 girls was Neeson's daughter ? 7-9-09 Another couple of additional complaints: 4) Liam Neeson playing his recording while investigating in the apartment, and listening to his daughter screaming out ""oh my God, they took her !"", when in reality she yelled this out loud before Neeson evern turned on his tape recorder and 5) Neeson takes the camera card in order to investigate its contents and it is easy to notice that the photo one of the girls took of the other outside the airport (prior to them both being photographed by the creep) is not there."

It's like he had them in him for years, which is something i really appreciate being a fan of realistic martial arts. I must add here that Matt Damon did a great job there in his Bourne movies (yes, and i loved Brad Pitt and Eric Bana at Troy). I really thank them for that effort and i pay gladly for the dvds of their movies because of that.<br/><br/>Said that, the movie succeeds in creating a flow of emotion in the audience (me). Sympathy and a bit of shame about a father who can't clearly keep the love of his daughter or his ex-wife (fantastic and beautiful Famke Jansen, she looks so beautiful when she's upset). Lucyly for him, the situation will be that he will be able to use his only good skills to regain the love of his family. Drame ensues, rage and fear, and in the end an exhilarating sense of happiness and ""justice has been done"" feeling. All of that in a common kind of movie, but crafted in a clean nice way that takes you in from the first minute to the end.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is great and i bet this movie will make some part of his audience that didn't know him much to gain lot of respect for his work."

","I decided to comment after seeing this get 8.0 here on IMDb. That's a sad commentary on something in society. This movie can be summed up as ""geriatric Jean Claude."" I'll also mention that if you want to produce unbelievable nonsense like this, you should try to create characters the audience can actually care about to some degree. The key point here, though, is that everything was as unlikely as possible. The daughter just happens to be kidnapped by sex slave traders. The father just happens to be some sort of ""black ops"" expert, etc. This really comes across as the fantasy (or nightmare) of a guy having a mid life crisis. I suggest buying a red corvette instead, but if you can't afford it, I guess you can always rent ""Taken."" If this is even a ""fair"" movie, Bronson's ""Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects"" should have cleaned up at the Oscars! I won't waste any more of my time on this."

","Liam Neeson in an action role that makes Steven Seagal look sleepy and tired? Who wudda thunk it! What a well made movie and a joy to ride.<br/><br/>I agree with the previous comments on this movie. It is well paced, the action is mostly all believable, and once the fun begins, you hardly get to catch your breath.<br/><br/>Famke Janssen is perfect as the ex-wife you love to hate but besides a bubbly performance by Maggie Grace as daddy's little girl, this movie is all Liam Neeson. Now, he has never really impressed me before in a movie but he gets kudos for his performance here. It wasn't what I expected and I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>One thing that really impressed me was the lack of strong language and gratuitous sex. If not for the violence, this movie could be rated PG. Even then, except for one scene which caused my wife to turn away, the violence was tastefully done, not needing gory effects to carry the film. This just proves that a great action movie does not need vulgar language and unnecessary sex/nudity to succeed.<br/><br/>Basically, a man's 17 year old daughter is kidnapped by a sex slave/prostitution ring and he goes to get her. All I can say is that they picked the wrong girl to snatch; her dad is an ex-Federal agent who hasn't lost his touch.<br/><br/>If you don't go in expecting too much after all of this glowing praise, I believe that you will be pleasantly surprised as well."
"concubis","4","15","30","1 July 2009"," Bowel Movement Inducing
","After watching the first 20 minutes or so of this film, I seriously considered taking a walk. As mind-numbingly silly and atrocious as it is, I decided to wait in hopes of a single interesting thing to happen. What you get at the beginning is a borderline obsessive father who only thinks about his 17 year old daughter, a birthday party for said daughter who gets a freaking horse from her stepfather (a HORSE?!), an ungrateful ex-wife, and a Britney Spears wannabe.<br/><br/>The daughter is the main reason this film is a turn-off. I don't doubt that Maggie Grace may be an adequate actress, but here she portrays such a dumb, childish, naive, annoying 17 year old with the mind of a 12 year old that perhaps it's the writing that is at fault. Just watch her run and jump clumsily with glee when she gets what she wants and you won't believe your eyes. It wouldn't be a spoiler to say that the movie has a happy ending (it's implied in the tag-line!), but I still found myself hoping for the worst for this pitiful, spoiled brat. <br/><br/>When the film does ""start"", there are a few cool sequences involving Liam Neeson maintaining his cool as he breaks bones in search for his daughter. However, Daniel Craig's Bond he is not.<br/><br/>Finally, I use the term ""happy ending"" loosely. Sure the girl is rescued, but what about the numerous others who are locked in the sex-trade industry? This film could have been so much more if it had portrayed some government initiative to bring it down, rather than the rescue of just one truly obnoxious American girl."

","If you've seen the trailer then there is little to be said about the plot, because you know it - Liam Neeson's 17 year old daughter, in Paris on vacation, is kidnapped by Albanian sex-slave traders. Unfortunately for them, Neeson is a retired US government covert operative of some kind, with skills and resources which enable him to pursue the kidnappers, extract information, and exact retribution.<br/><br/>This is a good action thriller, somewhat in the Bourne mould, with a solid and credible performance by Neeson at its heart - the emotional stakes are clear throughout, but Neeson's character's professionalism is completely in charge as long as it is necessary. It is refreshing to see a protagonist doing what he has to do with utter ruthlessness, with no gentlemanly pussyfooting around.<br/><br/>There are some plot threads left untied (literally in the case of a thread which he finds at the kidnap scene but then never pursues, as far as I could see), and there is some pretty wild variance in how easily he takes out the kidnappers. But for all that, the action never lets up, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."

I always find it amusing that the mafia is able to penetrate a foreign country, setup a lucrative illicit business and bribe all the right cops but can't deal with one over the hill superhero.

","Having hardly seen his wife (now ex) and daughter for the last decade or so due to his work, Bryan is now a former special agent who has taken his retirement early in order to move close to where his estranged family now live. Despite his better judgement, he gives consent for his 17 year-old daughter to go to Paris with a friend. However all his ""paranoia"" is justified when his daughter calls him during an abduction by some unknown men. Using his contacts, Bryan learns of an Albanian group specialising in kidnapping travelling young women into sex slavery and estimates he has 96 hours maximum before she is drugged beyond redemption and sold into prostitution. Calling on a lifetime of skills, Bryan goes to Paris to track down those responsible and find his daughter.<br/><br/>I have not heard or read any reviews for this film when I went to see it but I imagine that many of them will have called this film a cross between Death Wish and the Bourne films because that is what it happens to play like. The Death Wise side of it makes it a little harder to enjoy but the Bourne side makes it worth seeing. The thin plot is where we have the Death Wise material as the nice retired man who loves his daughter turns out to have been correct that the world is a hideous place outside of the US whenever his daughter gets kidnapped. With hours before she is transformed into a junkie and working for her hits, Joe goes to a Paris where it appears that the Louvre is the only building NOT fully of young women trafficked into sex (and we never seen that so I have no proof). Fortunately, rash violence will save the day. OK so politically this is not the most pleasant pieces of work to be watching but, aside from the first twenty minutes of setup (some of which I could have done without) the plot doesn't really matter and it becomes a race against time thriller.<br/><br/>This is where it does owe a great debt to Bourne because the filming style, the action, the urgency and the fighting style are all very similar to the formulae used to good effect in that trilogy. The camera never sits still, the editing is fast and the sound-effects produce an audience reaction themselves. Of course it is very much derivative of Bourne and not up to that high standard but it does still make for an engagingly violent thriller. When it stops moving even for a second, it sags and it doesn't seem to know how to link the scenes (so many actions scenes fade to black and then into a slower scene setting up the next sequence) but mostly it keeps the pace high and keeps moving. This does not make it a great film though, and it is quite a cynical affair in some regards however it is hard to fault it when it delivers such solid thrills as its main function.<br/><br/>Of some surprise to me was to see how effective Neeson was in the lead. Channelling some of his crazed performance from Darkman, he is a tremendous force ripping through criminals and surprisingly convincing in the action scenes with fluid and natural motions (helped by very good editing as well). The rest of the cast don't matter so much but Janssen, Berkeley and Vallance are all odd finds in smaller roles while Grace does her bit in regards being a thoughtless teenager and then ""in peril"". Morel's direction is effective even if it is easy to imagine that he has lots of Paul Greengrass films at home and had been studying them pretty closely.<br/><br/>Taken is not a brilliant film but if you accept it for what it is then it is an effective thriller driven by brutal (but not gory) violence which is justified by the family heart of the plot, much like Death Wish did. It is best to ignore the ""message"" within all this and just leave your brain off to enjoy the action which, while not Bourne level, is still effective and enjoyable."

The actors carry it off too - this is Neeson's movie of course, but even the teenage daughter is played quite genuinely (ie: genuinely irritating... these kids today, I don't know...) and you can feel Luc Besson's touch in the jarring mix of the sweetly sad/sensitive/sentimental protagonist with an explosively violent side to his personality. What's up with Luc Besson - did he only direct as a stepping-stone to screen writing? He can really smash a film like this home... but I digress.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film lots, it was a free preview screening but looking back it would be well worth paying for.<br/><br/>Caution: If you're French, Albanian or Arabian... prepare to be offended!"

Liam Neeson recently made some poor decisions concerning the characters he represented on the screen, I already thought he might be running out of money. Dumb stereotypes like the bitching ex-wife, her new of course old and rich husband, a retarded daughter of 17 who acts all the way like a 7 years old and the Neeson character himself, the ex-CIA torturer / killer, but therefor ridiculously enough all loving and righteous are totally insulting each educated public's intelligence. But even worse are all those cheap prejudices against people from the Balkan states or Arabia. Of course they are all criminals without exception and are invading countries that like to see themselves as the crown of civilization, which is nothing less than sheer fascism. Following this perspective it is only logical and without a shadow of a doubt allowed to kill each and every of these ""parasites"" in the most violent ways, which are all shown detailed to guarantee a most disgusting pleasure. Of course Liam Neeson being a deadly one man army with no scruples whatsoever kills an entire legion of these subhuman beings throughout the film, which finally presents us the most predictable and sugar-coated happy end. What have we been served? A trigger happy superior white man who blows away all the low life crooks from evil countries where everybody has a darker skin and can never be anything nothing more than woman trafficking cockroaches that need to be squashed as they deserve it. Again: this is only one thing: fascism on screen. Quo Vadis, Liam Neeson?"

The cinematography is excellent and the editing masterful. Action sequences are beautiful and deliberate. The soundtrack/audio is specific but not deterring. This movie reeks of ""Leon"" or ""The Professional"" or even ""Ronin"" and will have that cult following who will rant about it for years. Specific details made me think of ""The Professional/Leon"" (for example the sleeping/sitting in the armchair by Neeson) and I was not surprised to learn it was written by Luc Besson (director of ""The Professional/Leon""). I thought that many action films fail because of the lack of attention to detail, but this is not the case for ""Taken"". It is a must see for action fans."

It's a light film starring the peerless David Niven, co-starring Mexican legend Cantinflas and featuring cameos by many of the Hollywood's biggest stars. The movie won five Academy Awards including Best Picture, and has charmed millions over the last 57 years.

I thought of mine the whole time I was watching this flick and I begrudgingly became extra aware of parents' POV when they have to let go of their kids. It really can be a bad, crazy world out there, and after watching Taken, you'd want to have a dad like Liam Neeson's character, Bryan Mills.<br/><br/>Bryan retired from the CIA to get closer to his beloved daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), who has just turned 17. Kim lives with Bryan's ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), and asks permission from him to go to Paris with a friend. He reluctantly allows her, and his worst fears come to life when she is kidnapped by an Armenian white slavery ring. Bryan is forced to use his special set of skills to get his daughter back, armed with only very few clues, in only a few hours he has before she disappears forever.<br/><br/>Written by Luc Besson (The Fifth Element, The Transporter series), Taken is the impressive Hollywood directorial debut of cinematographer Pierre Morel. He has loads of help from Neeson, though, who is super believable transitioning from ultra-doting dad to unstoppable force to reckon with. If you're ever in trouble, you'd want to have him on your side. When he says he's coming to get you, you know he will, especially when he quickly and efficiently handles anyone who gets in his way. I would definitely like to see him taking on more roles like this one. It was just as startling to see the beautiful Janssen in a subdued mother role, having been used to seeing her as the femme fatale or the superhero for the better part of her career. While definitely pretty, Grace was miscast as Kim. Not only is she a decade older than the character, she's already famous as whiny Shannon in Lost. While still whiny, her acting was too affected, perhaps trying to compensate for playing someone much younger. She ran like a retard and her misplaced mannerisms distracted from the movie.<br/><br/>Still, I found Taken to be v. entertaining; needless to say, don't take it so seriously!

","This film has much going for it. Liam Neeson is a credible leading man as Bryan, the retired Special Forces Agent who is trying to rebuild his relationship with his daughter Kim, after his wife remarried.The action is exciting, relentless,and well-staged.Largely set in Paris, the locations are a welcome change from standard Hollywood fare and are well handled by Director Morel, and Writer Besson, both native Frenchmen.The big budget gives plenty of bangs for your buck -or Euro, and the 90 odd minute running time flys by with a convincing story steeped in the ""revenge"" genre so often played out in Westerns.<br/><br/>But there is also much wrong with it, which, considering the acting talent and budget, could have been put right.The language issue is horribly fudged.Sometimes French and Albanian is sub titled, sometimes it is not. Sometimes French characters speak in English, sometimes they do not. Most comic is a scene in which Neeson impersonates a French Police Officer to Albanians, in broad American English!<br/><br/>This unwillingness to immerse in the French culture creates other problems.Bryan has apparent close connections with the French Authorities which helps him through the plot no end, but it seriously detracts from the ""stranger in a strange land"" dynamic which helps a tale like this.Equally, the girls, once ""taken"" hardly appear again. I would gladly have lost the unnecessary 4x4 chase, shoot-out and explosions at the Albanians camp for a view of ""the other side"".<br/><br/>Equally, the shoot outs both at the ""Auction"" Hotel and the Sheikhs boat are preposterous and needlessly over the top, the story would have been more effective for a bit of restraint, not less.Finally, the racial stereotyping is lazy.The Americans are good and wholesome, the French corrupt, Albanians, swarthy and evil, Arab Sheikhs, fat with exotic sexual demands. Although mainly set in Paris, rarely is there a french ambiance to proceedings or sense of ""place"", in sharp contrast to the recently released ""In Bruges"". No reference at all is made to the fate that befalls his daughters travelling companion.<br/><br/>So, an exciting enough film, enjoyable enough in its own right which should have been a lot better."

After the opening set-up, the action is non-stop and amply displays Neeson's training and an athletic skill that belies his late-fifties age. Written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, the dialog is crisp and compelling. All in all, a wonderful action film that has you pulling for the protagonist from beginning to end. Although many other reviewers cite the similarities to the Bourne franchise, they are probably too young to fully appreciate how closely the flow of the film parallels the Death Wish series, particularly in the efficient and dispassionate manner in which Neeson's character dispatches ""the enemy"" to meet their maker.

"DICK STEEL","10","5","8","10 April 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Taken
","It's been just too long waiting for an action thriller that will knock my socks off, given too many bland attempts that left me wondering if the genre is too tired for my liking, with nothing left to wow. Then comes the Europa Corp team of Pierre Morel directing a Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen story, and Taken now ranks as one of my contemporary favourites for its simple story executed with so much style and gripping pace, that you'll be left breathless by the time the end credits roll.<br/><br/>The trailer had one of the best monologues that I'm sure would have put many in the theatres, and probably be representative of the film. You have a stoic looking Liam Neeson as a father who tells the stranger at the end of the other line the conditions that the game will be played in, with perhaps bluff calling against bluff, only for the challenge and gauntlet to be thrown. From then on it's a non-stop adrenaline rush because this daddy happens to be a top ex-covert operative for the US government, so the bad guys essentially have chosen a wrong opponent to play the game with.<br/><br/>The story worked well in dipping into some familiar fears, where daddy's little girl Kim (Maggie Grace) tells her dad lie after lie so as to cover up her tracks in wanting to do things she knows he would disapprove of. Such as, in this case, going on a tour of museums in Paris supposedly, rather than letting him know of her intent of being a groupie with friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy) chasing U2 all over Europe. Some may dismiss this fear as paranoia, but I think that heightened sense of awareness is a by product occupational hazard, and it's always better to err on the side of caution. For any parent who are confident of their kid's conduct, there is absolutely no guarantees that their kids' friends would toe the same line, and there are often those who are magnets for trouble due to their thrill seeking. As is in this case where you see supposed safeguards to lower risks being systematically peeled away.<br/><br/>With his reluctant consent and lessons being thrown in on very simple survival tips (that would even serve well in real life), things still go wrong according to Murphy, and Liam Neeson's Brian has to race against time in finding a needle in the perennial haystack, relying on contacts and skills built over the years in carrying out government missions of prevention to save masses, now to put them into something more personal when addressing what could be any parent's worst nightmare, in having their daughters sold to the sex slave trade.<br/><br/>Action-wise, Morel employs a whole host of fights ranging from gun battles, knives and the good ol' fisticuffs, with Neeson employing some cool Shinsai Goshin Kai moves for close quarter combats to take out opponents. You might balk at how it's probably another one man army movie with the hero ripping through the streets of Paris, but this borders close to the Jason Bourne movies in the way opponents are dispatched without remorse and without much bullshit. It's clinical as it is deadly, just the way I suppose anyone would do so without the very hokey monologues that plague lesser films prior to each kill. The action direction was top notch without resorting to cheap MTV styled quick cuts, and had kept the shaky-cam syndrome at bay, which in turn provided for a pure adrenaline rush for action junkies out there.<br/><br/>Taken well deserved its accolades and I say again, one of the best action thrillers to have hit the screen of late after a number of bland peers. I highly recommend this and it's a shoo-in as a contender for top films of this year. See if you can spot that SQ plane flying overhead in a scene too!"

Director Pierre Morel are new to me, but his debut as director was in another Luc Besson written ""Banlieue 13"" and he has been involved as cinematographer in both ""The Transporter"" and ""Danny The Dog"", which both are written by the Besson/Karem duo. To be honest Luc Besson haven't been convincing to me in much he has done since his work in back in those days with ""Leon"" and ""The Fifth Element"", but he is back now. No doubt about it.<br/><br/>""Taken"" is very much mold in the same ways as the Bourne trilogy. The camera angles and the fighting style very much follows the way the Bourne movies was done, but here the main character are driven by his goal rather than spending half the time wondering who's the bad guys. It makes for better action rather than the spy vs spy ways of Bourne, and Liam Neeson does a performance Bruce Willis' John McClane from the early Die Hard movies would be proud of.<br/><br/>He is the been-there-seen-it-all former CIA-agent retired to spend more time close to his 17 year old daughter he's been seeing to little of because of his work. His daughter now lives with the ex-wife and a stepfather, and Neeson does an excellent job giving life to the father on the sideline in the early stages of the movie. A very common and realistic family way in these days, and as the main plot of the movie revolves around girl trafficking it stays with another relevant problem of the darker side of life too many girls are victimized by still.<br/><br/>It do take some time until the action unfolds, but the time is well spent giving the audience an insight into the relationship between the family and into the main characters background. And when it takes off, the movie doesn't slow down until the end credits.<br/><br/>I might have given my rating on the upper side of what it deserves, but as an action movie I think it really deserve it. If you watch it as the action entertaining it is, it delivers in more ways than I've seen in a long long time. Maybe even not since Die Hard, and that's about 21 years ago.....<br/><br/>Highly recommended 93 minutes."
"agonyzer","8","5","8","31 January 2009"," Film Review: Taken
","Director Pierre Morel has given us a solid winter movie experience with Taken (2009), an action/thriller with plenty of character. I went into this film expecting lots of action. I got that action, and more.<br/><br/>The opening frames of this film are, unquestionably, canned sentiment. This theme continues throughout the beginning of the movie, but it isn't the generic stuff. It's the satisfying, nostalgic kind, a sort of cinematic Chef Boyardee, if you will, and not the cold, straight-out-of-the-can collegiate sustenance, but the lovingly warmed kind your mother always made you. <br/><br/>Our hero, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is the kind of guy a lot of us thirty-somethings can really identify with. He ekes out a retiree's life in a cheap apartment, to be close to his teenage daughter, a lovely young thing who lives with the ex-wife and her new, rich, husband. The relationship is strained, since the ex, Lenore (Famke Janssen) hardly approves of Bryan's way of life, even though he's given up the spy game.<br/><br/>So here's a man who gets emasculated at every turn, but willingly suffers it to build a relationship with daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Her businessman stepfather, more present in his white collar than Bryan could ever be in his CIA issue, offers up an Arabian horse to compete with Bryan's karaoke machine.<br/><br/>But when young Kim is abducted by slave traders in Paris, Bryan earns his keep. As the tension builds, we see an agent-turned-father in his real element. It isn't long before his buddies in the trade get him enough info to start the hunt, and it's here that the pace really starts moving.<br/><br/>Before long, Bryan's in France, dealing out one erg after another of brutal justice as he tracks down his daughter. Now, don't get me wrong, it's not all chases and fights. Well, no, that's a lie. It is all chases and fights, but not only are they perfectly filmed, timed, and acted, but they do a terrific job of portraying the character. Now, Bryan Mills isn't your usual good guy. He's not your usual antihero either. Hell, he's not even your usual Jason Bourne. He's a father with years of combat and espionage experience, and he holds nothing back in retrieving his daughter. Every scumbag who gets in his way pays an unmerciful, but suitable, price. Beautiful, vicious martial arts, not entirely unrealistic gunfights, and a breakneck pace reveal a man willing to do anything for his daughter.<br/><br/>Any father should be able to enjoy the seeing the beastly side of parental urges played out so artfully. But there's more to it than that. <br/><br/>This is a movie that's also topical in a few ways. The slave trade is very much alive in the modern world, and could use some attention. In Taken, it gets that exposure. Furthermore, there are themes revolving around the broken family, the general disdain of Americans abroad and government corruption.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was, on all counts, even with the writing. That is to say, it was incredible. <br/><br/>Only a single grammatical error and a fairly dull musical score detracted from my enjoyment. <br/><br/>I am pleased to give Taken 8 of 10 points."
"djuric01","8","5","8","30 December 2008"," Entertaining film all around, great acting by cast.
","This movie was well made and really captivating, both story wise and flow. Before watching the film, I remembered seeing a preview for it, and in it it showed how his daughter went to Paris, and then they spoke on the phone as her friend and she were being kidnapped. The preview continued with the phone conversation that followed between Liam Neeson's character, Brian, and Marko. This scene happened early on in the movie, and it was followed by a good hour of dramatic rescue activity and action scenes that showed Brian's fighting skill and his shooting and aiming abilities. Taken had a great cast, Liam Neeson was awesome and played his role confidently, using his natural suaveness to kick ass and beat the hell out of some Albanians. The rest of the cast played their roles as well. One issue that shows up is the cars in the movie are mostly automatic and there is one which is kind of both, but aren't cars in France manual?"
"JoaoPovoaMarinheiro","8","5","8","16 November 2008"," Neeson teaches a lesson to Bond.
","Is it really that fast? Oh yes. At an astonishing level, 'Taken' achieves to manage a very quick rhythm with no dead-moments. Liam Neeson is perfect to the job, and gives this year's James Bond a knockout.<br/><br/>Pierre Morel's directing exploits the simplicity of the plot and creates a paced level to the movie's environment. The movie is always focused on the film's quick ambient and action, rejecting the few calm moments existing.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is THE man. The action starts when Bryan's daughter is kidnapped, and then what we have is a roller coasting ride. Liam Neeson accomplishes what's expected of him and just kicks-ass, by dismantling all the human-trafficking organization in France in only a few days (or for us 93 minutes, which gives an even faster sensation).<br/><br/>If you are in for adrenaline, then this is the right movie for you. If you want to see Liam Neeson in a bad-ass character, then this is also a movie for you.'Taken' is one of the best action movies 2008 has to offer and probably one of the best of the genre in years. Action lovers, you'll love this - 8/10."

","I had no idea about ""TAKEN"" when I was stepping inside of the theatre. Liam is one of my favorite actors. But since I see the movie's poster and read his name on it, I even didn't know that Liam was in the leading role. Anyway, after a few minutes later, I started to focus on the film and the show started when the sweet daughter left the country with her best friend. Since ""Bourne"" series, honestly, for a long time, I did not watch such realistic fighting scenes! This movie made me fully satisfied with it's directing, cast and atmosphere. It was very serious, hard and straight. Screenplay is simple but tempo makes you to forget about it. Once it's DVD comes out, I will definitely add it to my archive. Neeson was like a storm during the film. He was very successful when we match his performance to his age. As I mentioned, movie just have a simple story but very watchable and entertaining. Go and get it!"
"rajdoctor","6","5","8","12 May 2008"," Taken
","The name sounds familiarity. Yes, a famous TV series with the same name was there on Aliens, UFO etc. but this movie has nothing to do with the TV series or aliens.<br/><br/>The story is about a retired US spy Bryan (Liam Neeson) who is overprotective of his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Even after cautious NO from Bryan, Kim decides for a trip to Paris with her friend, where both are kidnapped by a European gang of girl traffickers. Before they are sold, Bryan has 72 hours to rescue them. What follows is a ruthless and clinical tracking by Bryan in the streets of Paris. In the end, Bryan is able to save his daughter back.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson, though a bit haggard with age, brings immense amount of life to this role of US spy. He is a pleasure to watch when he is at the job he knows and does best, taking risks and always a step ahead of his enemies. He is the heart and soul of this movie. Without him, the movie would not have been as good as it is now.<br/><br/>The cinematographer turned Director Pierre Morel, does a fine job with his second venture (this too like his first one Banieule 13 is shot in Paris). The story is linear and is told with clarity. The story builds up slowly but holds your interest till the very end. The action sequences are shot immensely well, and the fights of Liam Neeson reminded me of Steven Seagal's style of martial arts.<br/><br/>With Liam Neeson not getting injured till the very end, it was not necessary to show him getting injured during the last fight with a puny fellow. Anyways, it is a good action movie to watch.<br/><br/>(Stars 6.5 out of 10)"
"EmmanuelPerson","9","14","30","24 July 2008"," Bourne-again Liam!
","This is trying to be a more emotionally-grounded version of the Bourne Identity movie franchise. Matt Damon's character is fighting for himself, whereas Liam's character is fighting for his daughter. I think this makes it all the more powerful on an emotional level. You feel for Liam. <br/><br/>The initial daughter-father plot line setup is a bit cheesy and painful: 1/Super-happy airhead I-love-you-daddy daughter: Check. 2/Annoying ex wife and uber-rich step-father: Check. 3/Post-divorce Father-Daughter relationship issues: Check.<br/><br/>But it's all excused because it serves the plot well as noted above. Still, they could've cut the airport and singer meetup closing scenes at the end. I was so pumped up I was expecting the daughter's car to be carjacked at the airport!<br/><br/>It's littered with other clichés (Albanians, Arabs, French lover etc...) and completely omits dealing with the other slave girls, but at least it exposes a rather nasty business to the public.<br/><br/>Luc Besson's style is omnipresent and he rightly didn't lay it too heavy on the aggravatingly uber-cool action scenes like in Revolver or Transporter. It's just right.<br/><br/>Memorable scenes: telling his daughter to describe her kidnappers -live-, threatening kidnapper Marco on the phone, shooting the french policeman's wife, construction site brothel, slave auction, getting Marco to read 'Good Luck'.<br/><br/>An adrenaline pumper of a movie I tell you!"

"lisaanne724","2","8","15","3 September 2010"," PLEASE! If you found this movie enlightening in any way, continue to educate yourself about the realities of human trafficking!
","Maybe I expected more because it's an issue I care a lot about or maybe I ought to avoid the action genre altogether, but I'm appalled and shocked to see how many positive reviews are out about this film, not to mention, how many people suggested it to me after learning about my interest in the topic.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is ridiculously superficial and some of the worst acting/writing I've ever seen. SUCH a horrible way to simplify such a serious and complicated issue. The writer had to have read a brief article about human trafficking and thought it was a great dramatic plot for a warm-hearted, happy ending action flick. while it did highlight some basic facts about trafficking and addresses the idea that ANYONE, even wealthy American girls, can be vulnerable, it does such an extreme injustice to actual victims/survivors. Unfortunately, a film that could have been effective in raising awareness about human trafficking, seems to have only reinforced ideology that young girls fall victim to these sort of operations because of their stupidity and all they need is a big strong man to come save them while they're still ""pure"". While her mother was extremely foolish in not taking any action to prepare her for the trip, the plot suggests that the daughter's desire for independence led to her demise, succeeding in blaming the victim, as we tend to do in these situations.<br/><br/>This movie could have so much better if they had created a situation where the daughter does everything right and still becomes a victim because of the extent of deception tactics used in this industry. The film is only 93 minutes! It could have easily been extended to develop the plot and create a more plausible context. People who are trafficked are most often lured in by people they trust, not just some cute random at the airport telling them about a party. They should have ran with the plot of visiting museums and experiencing the culture of Europe and had her fall in love with some dreamy French guy or take some awesome job offer that turns out to be a trap. Take out one of the 5 car chase scenes and actually create a story! They could have done SO much to create a strong female character who, despite her age, naivety and horrible situation, can be resilient and inspirational to other young women.<br/><br/>Although the film did highlight typical experiences of trafficking victims such as forced drug use and repeated rape, as well as the complications of police corruption, they should have put a name or face to this experience rather than keeping the main character as the one who's somehow spared with her virginity still in tact, days after her original kidnapping. Even if this were the case, she would have been significantly traumatized due to beatings, intimidation, or simply witnessing what's happening to others.<br/><br/>Instead of the happy ending with lots of smiles and getting to meet a famous pop star, they should be addressing the after effects of extreme trauma. Even if they want to make it less intense for the PG13 rating, they could at least acknowledge that even someone rescued early on might need some therapy or support and won't be smiling and jumping around when she's reunited with her family, acting like ""phew, glad that's over! Now I can get back to my fun life as a teenager and my future career as a pop singer!"""

","What can i say, great movie, one of the best i have seen for a long time, probably at the same level of enjoyment with the Bourne trilogy. Luc Besson is one of my favorite action movie Director and he knows how to keep you on your seat for the entire length of the movie. Neeson is playing one of his best action roles and the entire casting is there to support him. To bad i didn't see it at the movies but even at the comfort of my own place on a DVD, i was still glued to the screen. Imaculate storyline, revenge is not a plate eaten cold but an action TAKEN now, and immediately. The problem of watching such a good movie is that you'll be judging everything else based on that and from the movies that i've watched lately i can assure you it will be some time until the next good one. Just great."

","Okay, I put a 10 out of 10 as my rating, more like a 9.5 out of 10, but whatever. I've watched many, many action movies and usually when I find one rated PG-13, I'm always wishing it was R because of the material that's left out. Most of the time it feels PG-13 and you can't believe anything's real in a feeling like that. But this movie really pushed the boundaries of a PG-13 rating with the violence and let me tell you, I'm glad it did! I know violence doesn't make a movie better, but in this case, it really adds to the intensity of Liam Neeson's character, which is Dirty Harry mixed with John McClain and a little dash of Jason Statham in Transporter mode. It's a very taut thriller with an interesting setting and story line, filled with outlandish (yet effective and very cool) fight/shootout sequences that only Luc Besson of The Professional fame could bring to the screen. I highly recommend this film to anyone wanting a good revenge thriller with an aging man who can still kick some serious butt!"
"Leofwine_draca","7","3","4","5 November 2016"," A slick but rough action gem
","Written by Luc Besson, who's responsible for just about every decent French action flick in the last decade, and directed by Pierre Morel who also directed DISTRICT 13, there was no real chance that TAKEN wouldn't be a decent thriller. It's a lean, mean movie, pared down to the essential elements and while it would be wrong to go in thinking of this as an epic, it's very good for what it is. TAKEN is essentially a revenge film that never shies or veers away from the main narrative thrust, which is that Liam Neeson must find his kidnapped daughter before she's sold by sex traffickers.<br/><br/>The film is heavily influenced in both direction and style by the BOURNE movies, which is no bad thing as those films are among my favourites. There's a focus on realism throughout as well as a gritty edge that sees Neeson taking no prisoners in his search for his missing girl. Neeson's not everybody's first choice as an action hero but he's actually pretty good in the role – never for one moment do you not believe that he's capable of what he performs here. He's one of the screen's hardest good guys as of late.<br/><br/>I guess you might say the simple story is pretty predictable, but the story is never the strong point in these films anyway. Criticism has been levelled against this movie, claims of racism, of it being another variant of the old ""America's good, foreigners are bad"" xenophobia, but these critics are looking too hard. TAKEN wants to be a straightforward action flick, with plenty of thrills and spills, and it achieves its aims admirably. 2008 has been a pretty decent year for action flicks and this comes second to only RAMBO in terms of tension, suspense, and excitement.<br/><br/>The action scenes are well-handled in an over-edited way, similar to the ones you'll find in Bourne and Bond these days. Neeson battles an absolute ton of bad guys in set pieces that happen so quickly they're blink-and-you'll-miss-em. There are the requisite car chases, shoot-outs, and martial arts battles, as well as explosions and torture. It may not be art, and it may not be original, but I loved it anyway.<br/><br/>The movie actually gets better and better as it progresses; time is taken out to get to know the characters before plunging them into darkness and then the tension continues to ratchet up every few minutes until it's at breaking point. Kudos to the filmmakers for not shying away from the violence, which is strong throughout, although the film never dwells on it. A vein of black humour also helps immensely in this slick-but-rough action gem."
"emowyn97","9","3","4","9 December 2014"," Great Thriller--And Pretty Accurate for a Film on Trafficking
","Taken was a riveting, eye-opening film that I would recommend to a variety of viewers. It had enough ""shoot-em-up"" violence in it to appeal to most men, and enough father-daughter love and an emotionally provoking subject to appeal to most women. Of course, women can like action thrillers (I know I do) and men can appreciate emotional dramas, but my point is: the beauty of this movie is in the way it combines subgenres that are often unrelated. The creators were genius in doing this, and they were courageous in bringing to light the very touchy subject of human trafficking. The directing and writing was impressive, the story line and run time were perfect, and the casting was spot- on. <br/><br/>The writers and Neeson very touchingly created a character that is both admirable and relatable: ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills is driven by his love for his daughter, and his willingness to do anything for her. This love drives him to single-handedly rescue his daughter after she is taken by sex traffickers during her trip to Europe. Neeson beautifully portrayed Mills' tendency to range from rash to logical in such a situation. Neeson also very effectively communicated a father's cold revenge and his willingness to eliminate anyone who stood in between him and his daughter. Overall, Neeson's performance was absolutely stunning.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Taken is a pretty accurate portrayal of trafficking. It is set in Europe, where trafficking happens as often as it does in any other country on Planet Earth. I appreciated that the creators chose a European country to combat the myth that trafficking only happens in third-world countries to impoverished young women. Overall, the traffickers in this film are of all ethnicities, which shows that pimps are not limited to being of a certain ethnic background--usually one whose men are considered to often objectify and dehumanize women. However, Taken chose to use the kidnapping of two U.S. teenagers as the traffickers' method of capture, which indirectly encourages another myth: that the targeted group is middle/upper-class, attractive females in their late teens, and that they are always kidnapped. It is true that this scenario is not uncommon, but unfortunately, it doesn't do anything to educate the public in ways that they don't already know.<br/><br/>When most people think of trafficking, they think of the scenario that Taken used, rather than the fact that 50% of victims are boys, the average age of taken girls is 12 years old, and that most victims are coerced, and from any ethnic or economical background, rather than kidnapped. The movie also includes an emphasis that the girls are put on drugs to keep them in their state, though there is no mention of Stockholm Syndrome or other factors that force girls to stay. Mills' daughter Kim, once found by her father, willingly goes with him and runs to hug her stepfather when she gets off the plane back to Los Angeles. The last five minutes of the film show her happy, lively and confident. Sadly, if Kim was a real person, she would probably be too drugged-up to realize her father were rescuing her. Instead, she would be in need of much therapy and healing in all areas of her life. There is a contrast of Vegas-styled prostitution, trailer park ""trashy"" prostitution, and street-walking, which informs viewers that trafficking happens in many places and involves many different types of people. <br/><br/>Still, Taken is a very brave, and quite effective, portrayal of human trafficking, fatherly love and family, and criminal pursuit. My hope is that this movie has and will continue to educate, inspire and touch both men and women to take a stand against trafficking, to love their families, and to fight for what they know is right."

","Liam Neeson is one of my all time favorite actors. I have many of his movies, I would like to have them all. I even have Krull, which will be reviewed sometime in the future.<br/><br/>The actors in Taken are some of my favorites as well; Famke Jensen and Maggie Grace are just two of them. I thought the acting by these two and Neeson were phenomenal. Some of the best acting I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The script was awesome. The subject matter was pretty daring. The action itself was great. The only negative that I saw was when Liam Neeson was running. But I can't fault him too much, I don't run well either. But enough of that.<br/><br/>I give Taken 10 stars out of 10. From start to finish Taken is just a great movie.<br/><br/>Liking this movie as much as I did I have a hard time picking three of my favorites scenes. But The three that pop into my mind right now are some of the best of the movie.<br/><br/>The first scene is a difficult scene to watch. It's the scene where Amanda (Katie Cassidy) and Kim (Maggie Grace) are kidnapped from Amanda's cousin's apartment in Paris. Kim is talking on the phone with her father, Brian Mills (Liam Neeson). She sees through a window that a couple of guys have grabbed Amanda and she relays this to Brian. Brian tells Kim to go to the next room and hide under the bed. Brian talks to Kim calmly and explains what is going to happen and what he wants her to do. Kim is taken, but as she is being taken from the room she yells out things she sees. When everything is quiet Brian hears someone pick up the cell phone and hears breathing. Brian explains ""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for, I will find you, and I will kill you."" The response is ""Good Luck""<br/><br/>What a great scene. Even if it was difficult to watch.<br/><br/>The next scene I like is when Brian finds out where the girls were taken to in order to get them hooked on drugs and turned into prostitutes. He enters the house on the pretense that he is part of the local police force and he is now in charge of collecting the ""shake-down"" money for not putting a stop to illegal activities. At the end of the conversation Brian asks the five men in the room to translate a phrase he has on a piece of paper, it's in Albanian. The phrase is translated and said out loud by one of the men, who says ""Good Luck."" At that moment, Brian realizes that that man was the one he talked to on the cell phone that his daughter had. That is when he takes those five men out, along with all the other members of the gang that are in the house. Unfortunately, Brian finds Amanda in one of the upstairs rooms... dead from an apparent drug overdose. Then he finds one of the men alive and tortures him by strapping him to a metal chair and hooking up what looks like jumper cables to the light switch and turns it on. When Brian gets the information he wants, he turns the switch on and leaves it on walking out of the house.<br/><br/>Awesome sequence of scenes. It shows that a father will do almost anything to find and protect his children. That being said, the sequence of scenes that lead to Brian rescuing his daughter says that he will do everything possible to save Kim. That is an awesome sequence.<br/><br/>Brian Finds out that his daughter is going to be sold because she is a virgin. He finds out through a man he thought he was a friend that the man he needs is St-Clair and where to find him. Brian enters St-Clair's house and finds the auction rooms in the basement. He gets one of the buys to buy his daughter in order to save her. But Brian gets captured and sentenced to death by St-Clair. Brian escapes and kills St-Clair. He then follows after Kim and her ""owners"" in order to rescue her. He kills everyone on board the boat his daughter has been taken aboard. When he finds Kim she is being held at knife point by Sheik Raman (Nabil Massad). Raman attempts to negotiate, but Brian is in no mood to negotiate, so he puts a bullet through his forehead.<br/><br/>There are other scenes I could have talked about. Like when Lenore (Famke Jensen) tries to browbeat Brian into signing the permission form for Kim to go to Paris because she is under 18. Or the scene when Brian goes to his so called friend, Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin), in Paris by going to his apartment and shoots Jean-Claude's wife... in the arm. Or I could have described the scene where Brian saves Sheerah (Holly Valance) from some crazed fan who attempts to stab her after a concert.<br/><br/>Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen wrote one hell of a great movie. And Director Pierre Morel did a phenomenal job creating one of my favorite movies."

","This movie is an exciting ride from the moment Bryan's daughter Kim is taken until the time he is reunited with her on the Shah's boat. Bryan decides to take justice in and go around the system to get his kidnapped daughter back. Bryan's character almost appears isolated because he really has no one to help him find his daughter--the way he wants to find her. He's the only one who can find her. Although he is isolated by his method of justice, he still manages to successfully find his daughter, but not without significant casualties. This is the one part that bothered me about the film. There were many people injured and killed to find this man's daughter. He felt like the sacrifice was worth it, but was it? Were those individuals lives worth nothing? I know that this is just a film, but it did leave me with that question. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and it kept me entertained the whole time."

","This is a very good action/thriller flick. It currently holds a 7.9 rating at IMDb which it certainly deserves. The few people giving this a 1 or 2 star rating must be disgruntled French people who do not like to see the French government officials portrayed as corrupt bastards (which they often are anyway).<br/><br/>I generally like Liam Neeson so the fact that he is in the movie kind of got the movie off to a good start already. In this movie he plays a real bad--s, I-kick-the-sh-t-out-of-anyone-standing-in-my-way, former CIA agent hunting down the despicable low-life that kidnapped his daughter. I really, really liked the role he played in this movie. He makes characters like Bourne look like wussy. Even I was surprised when he actually shot the wife of the corrupt French government bastard to get him to talk. That was just awesome.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty much action all the way. Well, it starts off laying the groundwork for the story and here Liam Neeson is indeed playing a fairly timid father that seems to be a bit out of his depth. Once he gets thrown into his right element he quickly casts of the sheep's fur and reveals the wolf (sabre-toothed) underneath.<br/><br/>This is really a textbook action/thriller movie. A very enjoyable hour and a half indeed."

He doesn't need all the gadgets and gizmos that Bond and other action guys need to kill the bad guy. He uses his brain and he's killing the bad guys for personal reasons rather than to 'save the country' so this sets it apart from other films of this genre. <br/><br/>I was hooked from start to finish and I love that the film didn't feel long.

It is overall a brilliant film, some elements are quite different to other films; however as an action, drama is worked very well. I'm not always keen on drama, action kind of films but this worked because it was also kind of a horror in some parts.

","I didn't have many expectations but the film was surprisingly good due mainly to Liam Neeson's acting. Any other actor may not have brought the intelligence and ferocity of his character. Even though it was a short 93 minutes I thought emotionally it matched the movement of the plot of his character having only 96 hours to find his daughter. Sure there were lots of plot points where things just went his way and more things could've been thrown in his way but either way I think I would've felt satisfied with the ending.<br/><br/>This film is definitely Luc Besson's creation.

","Taken (2008): Dir: Pierre Morel / Cast: Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, Katie Cassidy, Xander Berkeley: Standard revenge thriller regarding both the kidnapped daughter as well as the faceless villains that her spy father will ""take"" down. Starts out well with retired spy Liam Neeson discovering that her Paris bound daughter has been kidnapped and he sets out to find her. Formula storytelling with mindless violence in toll. Directed by Pierre Morel with fine location work but that doesn't save this umpteenth Death Wish wannabe. Neeson holds his own as a father relying on his skill to find his daughter but it is his confidence in his ability that allow him to propel forward. Supporting cast is flat and might as well stayed home for all the good they are doing here. Maggie Grace plays his daughter who gets to sit around and await her father to kick ass and rescue her. Famke Janssen plays whining ex-wife whose thigh crushing villain in Goldeneye would have came in awfully handy here. Katie Cassidy plays daughter's brain dead friend who is about as useless as a person can get without being considered mentally unstable. Xander Berkeley also makes his presence known before realizing that this film is overrated and a career move for Neeson only. If anyone wishes to sit through a re-run of action clichés then this is your movie. This is basically a lackluster revenge tale where the audience gets taken. Score: 3 ½ / 10"

","I'll start by saying that this is one of the best films that I have seen. It is thoroughly enjoyable, when it ended it was as if I had woken up.

Not at all.<br/><br/>Every negative reviewer on this site is forgetting one thing... this is an action movie. It is not meant to say anything about other countries and their problems, it is not supposed to show an in depth view of the sex trade, and Bryan is not in Paris to save all of the girls who were taken. None of the problems people are finding with the plot are significant enough for this movie to deserve a 1 star review. <br/><br/>Is it possible for people to get offended by this movie and how it portrays Europe and the Middle East? Yes, but it is possible in this globalized world for people to be offended by anything if they let it. The people of the world are diverse and come from many different cultures and it is possible for anyone to take almost anything personal.<br/><br/>There is no reason to get outraged by this, it is a movie made for the purpose of keeping your eyes glued to the screen until the credits start rolling. It is a movie made for suspense, violence and revenge. It was not made for in-depth analysis by would-be professors of the internet.<br/><br/>All that must be asked of entertainment is that it serves its purpose. This is quality entertainment because it manages to fit as many bad ass, action filled, and ruthlessly violent moments into the short 93 minutes it encompasses."

","I have just watched this film on TV having made a point of missing it on the big screen - the awful trailer put me off! It is one of the worst, pretentious pieces of cinematic clap trap I have ever watched. Surely it is not trying to be a serious thriller. The plot line is clichéd, and predictable. The car chases likewise, the dialogue excruciating. It was like a third rate James Bond film without the humour. What ever was a well respected actor (Neilson) doing getting involved in this crass feature. Does he really need the money? It was as bad as the old Rambo films from Stallone, but at least we got what we expected from them. It seems that the film going public will watch anything today. This idea had the potential to become a superb, credible thriller. But what did we get? Avoid."
"williamh-101-270760","3","4","6","8 July 2011"," Taken is an a direct line with The Searchers.
","In all the reviews I have read of this movie, not one refers to its very clear and unmistakable debt to The Searchers, John Ford's much praised and sometimes justly maligned great western. There is reference to Commando and other movies, all of which probably are similarly indebted to Ford, but Taken has gone several steps further, in an almost shot by shot recap of some of the scenes of The Searchers. Granted, there is no Monument Valley in the background, but we have Liam Neeson grappling to have some sort of relationship with his daughter, while at the same time trying to deal with his former wife's present husband. This is a direct reflection of the more subtle relationship John Wayne had with his brother's wife, and his unstated but implied paternity of the girl kidnapped by the marauding Indians. The undercurrent of forced interracial sex in The Searchers is reflected in the much more explicit sexual slavery of Taken, but the father's desperate and unyielding search for his daughter is the same in both. At the very end of Taken, where Liam Neeson's character hands over his daughter to her mother and her mother's husband, who then prepare to get in their car and driver away, I expected Neeson to cross his right hand over and grab his left elbow, and then turn and walk off into the desert of his life. That it didn't happen is a tribute to Luc Besson, who probably thought he had taken (pun intended) the Searchers theme about as far as it could go, preferring instead to have a more hopeful ending. The Searchers continues to provide a basis for revenge and recovery stories, probably because it was the first of its kind, and dealt with basic themes of human connection, sexual tension, and ultimately the soul-destroying poverty of being alone even after accomplishing a great rescue. Taken is just one more step in the long line of movies repeating these themes. Besson knew what he was doing and where he got his ideas, I'm surprised no one else has worked it out as well."

Also the fact that the (nearly sexagenarian) Mr.Liam Neeson does all the ass-kicking in such an awesome manner it makes you wanna scream ""@#%$ THAT @#$%$ UP!!!"" right there in the theater. It's like he looked at all the lame-assed action roles that he had done so far(dark-man,star wars etc), and thought ""the next time i get an action role, I'm gonna RIP that $%$E$@#$-%$&@$& UP!!!"". He is really effective for a vengeful character especially in a scene when he is talking over the phone with his daughter, his rage seems to boil onto the screen. So far the oldie action men had done only a vaguely satisfying in the past few years (Bruce Willis, Stallone, Ford), but Liam BLOWS THEM AWAY!The only few downers in this movie are the poorly directed gun-fight scenes, the contrived plot and some plot devices that seem unimportant or are left hanging, like the pop-star and the hair in the mirror.

The acting is fairly well done (spy turned caring father is quite a hard role to fill). The camera, sound and lighting are also well done. Now, despite what I've said, of course there are flaws, for example, I think that the action/storyline ratio was waving more in the favour of action, the action was good, but if you were to add more story it would make the film drag on quite a lot. Both story and action was good, but i think Morel may have focused more on the action rather than story.

It's the kind of film Mel Gibson would turn his nose up at.<br/><br/>For a start, it's very broadly written. Neeson plays a dad estranged from his ex-wife - Famke Janssen, who played a wonderful femme fetale in GoldenEye all those years ago, and is now content to play a Desperate Housewives-style mom.. The dialogue is all, ""I really missed you Dad!"" ""I missed you too pumpkin!"" Rubbish exposition: Neeson meets his old mates, they reminisce about how they went to Beirut on a mission, how he cried off with no warning to attend his daughter's birthday. Clumsily signposting his past life as an action hero, along with his dedication to his daughter. Though one also might also think, this guy is pretty unreliable, he might be a bit soft in the head to desert his mates.<br/><br/>And it's that which kept me watching, the thought there might be a subtext going on here, that Neeson might be a bit simple. Later, Neeson and his mates are security for a rock princess; Neeson asks her for career advice for his daughter JUST AS SHE'S ABOUT TO SWEEP ONTO STAGE! Media types never like to dish out free advice to wannabe competitors at the best of times. What kind of response is he likely to get? He seems a bit retarded, likewise his paranoid fears about his daughter going to Paris. But no, we're meant to admire him.<br/><br/>It gets worse, and you begin to suspect it's a metaphor for US foreign policy. I can only imagine those giving this a high rating are Americans loving the double whammy of the French and the Arabs getting a kicking.

Basically the behavior portrayed in this film is exactly why the USA has lost almost all respect internationally. They go out of their way to demonize eastern bloc immigrants as the ones responsible for human trafficking activities just to add in some xenophobia. At the end of the film he saves his daughter but doesn't even bother to save any of the other of the women who were being sold. Don't waste your time on this film."

","The answer to this question depends on the level of political awareness and the political affiliation of the viewer. If you are a neoconservative or if you don't care about politics then you might enjoy this film as a pretty good (but not great) action movie. It is all there: the fights, car chases, explosions, the superhero etc. <br/><br/>But there is a difference between this movie and most other action movies: at its core is not entertainment but a political message. Other action movies try to suspend reality and take the viewer's mind away from the problems of the real world for a few hours. The villains are interchangeable - someone has to be the villain, after all - and events, behavior and circumstances are so far removed from reality or the perception of reality that everyone knows that they are not meant to be authentic.<br/><br/>""Taken"", however, is like a recruitment video for the ""war on terror"". It reminded me of many propaganda films made during WWII to boost morale, in which brave soldiers protect vulnerable nuns from the terrible enemy. ""Taken"" says: Don't believe the pacifists/appeasers (in this case those who say that foreigners could be trusted and France is a civilized country), it is OK to be paranoid and obsessed with ""security"" - nothing is more important -, the foreigner is the enemy, shed all moral inhibitions and be a killing machine, torture is good, don't think, don't hesitate, the world is out to get you."

There is also some pretty poor acting performances on show, the usually reliable Famke Jansen looks lost when asked to show emotion, Maggie Grace needs to go back to acting school, whilst some of the French actors on show give French actors a bad name.<br/><br/>However the true saving grace in the movie, outside of some serious revenge fuelled torture sequences, is Liam Neeson in the lead role of Bryan Mills. Charismatic and believable as a father hell bent on finding the one thing worthwhile that he has in his life, it's only here that Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen's uneven writing gets any sort of urgency to go with the tidily put together action sequences. Taken is an enjoyable film if taken within the context of its genre, and for sure the subject matter of skin trafficking is a noteworthy plot, but no one can surely deny it doesn't have a shallow core and honestly isn't giving anything new to a pretty stagnated formula...<br/><br/>By the by, the thrills ensure popcorn pleasing pleasures and thus it's rated as such. 7/10"

""Taken"" was OK. Very enjoyable, but, non the less, terribly, and I mean TERRIBLY clichéd and completely predictable from start to finish... Acting was horrible, especially from Famke Janssen and the princess of clichés- Maggie Grace. Wow, that girl seriously can't act. It's impossible for her, I think! In every scene (except the ones where she's drugged)she's jumping around like a total moron, to display a 17-year-old-girl type of behavior, I guess. In my opinion, she fails miserably. Totally unconvincing. Liam was good, as always. Though his lines were probably the most clichéd thing about this whole movie. ""Now is not the time for dick-measuring!"" and other lines like that were just...dumb. Now, on the bright side, there ARE some cool, fast paced, typical Luc Besson chasing and fighting sequences, which were also clichéd, but still enjoyable. My main point is, people - Stop. Overrating.

I thought this ended with Bronson and Death Wish 56. I don't know how the government ever let this guy go. He could wipe out a small country by himself. Then there is the physical toll. Dead people littering the streets and buildings. There is no humanity to any of them. Many of the people Neeson kills could well be just doing everyday jobs.

"ftyl","5","8","16","28 September 2008"," Taken is a series of violent sequences in search of a plot
","In Taken, Liam Neeson plays an overprotective father with a violent past whose paranoia is proved right when his daughter is snatched while on a trip to Paris. Mere hours later he is on the ground in the French capital, determined to find his daughter and punish those responsible. What follows is a haphazard series of fights, interrogations, car chases, more fights, several smashed windpipes and an ending totally at odds with the film which preceded it. <br/><br/>The action should have been harsh and brutal and while it is sometimes effective it is crippled by being framed too close and by the PG-13 rating. Who thought that a film dealing with violent revenge, dozens of deaths, torture and prostitution rings should be watched by people in their early teens?<br/><br/>Taken is all the more disappointing given the talent behind the camera. Luc Besson may not always come up with masterpieces when he's credited as a writer, but he can usually be relied on to churn out something that is fast paced and fun (Unleashed, The Transporter, etc). Likewise the director, Pierre Morrell was last responsible for the ridiculous but exhilarating free running action of District 13. Yet together they have managed to come up with one of the most underwhelming action films in recent memory. As for Neeson, he handles the few emotional scenes with his usual impressive restraint and, with his size and reach, looks like he might actually pack quite a punch in real life. But when the action pulls out a little and he's forced to run or throw himself through the air to avoid a hail of gunfire his 6'4"" frame just looks unwieldy and slow  essentially a really big, easy to hit target. There are also endless moments where Neeson suddenly appears behind another nondescript soon-to-be-corpse which always made me wonder what magic massive closet he had found to hide himself in. He is fine when he's hitting things and emoting but I think his career as an action star will be rather short lived. <br/><br/>I wanted to like Taken. It had potential as a gritty revenge film with the realistic action so popular since the advent of the Bourne series. Neeson is always a likable lead and the Besson pedigree with the French setting should have worked in its' favour. Unfortunately, the weakness of the story and random, unmotivated nature of the violence is simply boring, the potential wasted. Taken also shoots itself in the foot with its choice of subject matter. By delving into the subject of kidnapping tourists for prostitution it appears as though initially Morrell and Besson have some moral lesson for their audience. It soon becomes clear that they were merely looking for a backdrop for the action and the ugly stereotyping of the Eastern European characters in the film is irresponsible, even for a film of this type. Also, for a film rated suitable for young people, the lessons imparted by the hero are less than reassuring  if something bad happens to someone you love you really have no option but to kill dozens of people mercilessly until you reach some kind of resolution. This is fundamentally at odds with the initial plot of the film, as Neeson is trying to leave his past behind in an attempt to reconnect with his teenaged daughter (played with vapid gawkiness by Maggie Grace  proving her vacuous performance in Lost was not an accident). I'm not suggesting every film should have a blatant message of peace and love and there's no denying that nihilism can be cool but when it is taken to this level it has an effect on the overall coherence of the film.<br/><br/>Disappointing and bland, if this film was kidnapped in a foreign country I'd leave it there."

","This is a decent action flick that suffers from a few flaws. First, it is completely predictable -- there is never any suspense about how it's going to end, or where the plot is going to go. The plot, in a nutshell, is this: ex-special forces type retires to lead a peaceful life, then bad guys take his kid and he reverts to his one-man-army previous life and pretty much kills everyone in his path to get his kid back....which, of course, he does.<br/><br/>The fact that the action is absurd is OK since this is escapist fare -- things like when bad guys shoot at the hero with machine guns they always miss, but when the hero shoots back with one shot at a time he manages to kill everyone. This I can stomach. But the already thin pretense for why the hero starts killing everyone in the first place is REALLY absurd. What is it? -SPOILER ALERT- Bad East European immigrants running a sex trade decide the best place to get new flesh is by capturing rich tourists in Paris of all places. Apparently, routinely kidnapping kids of rich and connected people & turning them into doped-up whores is the path of least resistance.<br/><br/>A lot of people compare this movie to the Bourne series in terms of style. I suppose there's some overlap. But, really, the Bourne movies are far more entertaining and have a more clever plot. This movie is just entertaining nonsense."

Oh, yeah and did I mention he pretty much single-handily invades the country of France?? Well, there you go.<br/><br/>The other pleasure of Taken is seeing Neeson bringing the noise and the bodies as the 'action hero', though he's getting up there, Neeson is still a true physical presence.

I won't give away too many details but I will say it is a strong film that blends action, suspense and drama in a nicely concocted cocktail.

"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","5","9","30 January 2009"," Original, thrilling, and totally badass thanks to Liam Neeson
","In a world of James Bonds, Jason Bournes, and Frank Martins, it's hard for a little random ex-spy named Brian Mills to get some love. On the surface, his film seems a little formulaic, and he seems a little...well...old. However, once we get into Mills's story, and see how infinitely badass the wonderful Liam Neeson plays him, you'll probably be saying something along the lines of ""James who?"". 'Taken', which follows Mills as he pursues those responsible for kidnapping his daughter, is a heart pounding thriller with a stupendous display of badassery from Liam Neeson. It may have a plot that's sort of unbelievable, but it's one of the best action thrillers in years.<br/><br/>Why do critics dislike this movie? Is it because they have no ability to see beyond the obviously far-fetched events of the movie? Is it because they take themselves too seriously and don't know how to have fun? It's probably both of those two reasons, but I find peace in thinking that they're complete idiots who don't know what they're talking about...sometimes. The fact remains that 'Taken' is plain fun, popcorn entertainment, that doesn't resort to cheap explosions in looking for thrills. It relies on the gritty closeups of the marvelous hand to hand combat and stylistic action (Liam Neeson's 'Batman Begins' training certainly paid off here).<br/><br/>The film is the brainchild of Luc Besson, the mind behind the Transporter films. Here, he relies on a director that may be inexperienced as a director, but one who also has more experience in shooting action on film than most. Pierre Morel, responsible for the photography in action films such as 'War', 'Unleashed', and of course, 'The Transporter', does a great job in choreographing some very good action sequences, especially giving them some flavor when they end. The film was not just pure action, which was good, as it also showed Neeson's character working as a spy and shows some intelligence in that aspect.<br/><br/>Speaking of Neeson, it appears that his days as the kind hearted mentor figure in films such as 'Narnia' and 'Star Wars' are behind him. His ruthless, badass, and perfectly natural performance makes the movie watchable and carries it from start to finish (which isn't too long, as the film clocks in at one hour and 45 minutes including previews). Neeson is a veteran, and it really shows. His performance goes deep, and will excite the viewer in all ways. Maggie Grace was also noteworthy as his daughter (it was tough to recognize her without her blonde hair!).<br/><br/>This is probably the best example I've seen in awhile of how stupid and self-righteous most film critics can be. They fault 'Taken' for having events occur that aren't entirely realistic. Do they recognize the film for being a great roller coaster ride that will leave most viewers happy (pretty much my entire theater of 150 people seemed happy)? No. It's further proof that Liam Neeson is one of the best leading men around, and that these critics really need to catch up with the times."

But so much worse than that is when I read a review from some impressionable youngster who finds this disturbing viewing and thinks that it represents some kind of reality. I feel so angry that this kind of film gets funded - it totally misrepresents the whole issue of sex-trafficking and presents it with the most god-awful Hollywood distorted American messed up morality and paranoia. Luc Besson, what the hell are you playing at? This is cinema at its worst, if you cant find better uses for your film-making funds then for God's sake give them to someone else with some intelligence, some creative ideas, and a sense of morality which isn't completely cock-eyed and utter bullshit!"

","There are so many things wrong with this movie on so many levels, it's hard to decide where to begin. I watched it in it's entirety only because of the 'car wreck mentality'. It's terrible to see but you can't look away due to perverse curiosity. So, I kept wondering how much worse this movie could become? I was dumbfounded to find average to good external reviews. Some perplexing plot holes are: the bad guys grab the two screaming 'teenagers' from the Paris Apt, but evidently have the presence of mind to lock the doors behind them (Bryan had to break a window to get in). Also, if Bryan were desperate to find his daughter, why not just kick in the front door? Aside from all the absurd fight and shoot-out scenes (he dispatches 37 bad guys in total) the ending had to be the lamest part of the flick. The scene where he and his recently abducted, drugged, and traumatized daughter exit the airport: she does the goofy teenage girl run to mommy with a big goofy grin on her face-- like she actually saw the whole U2 tour, instead of barely escaping with her life. Lame-- so lame."

","This film would have done much better just after 9/11 up until about 2003 when there was no shortage of scared Americans running around. That and ""freedom fries"".<br/><br/>Now, it's reduced to pretty much what it is. A tired succession of clichés you expect from a network TV movie of the week. In addition, it's simply stupid. They could have called it ""Road Rage Father's Wet Dream"". At least then it could have qualified as intelligent satire.<br/><br/>If you were to reverse this and a European country were to make a film about a European spy's daughter coming to America to be kidnapped, drugged, and sold as a whore, there would probably be national outrage and boycotts.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Liam carries the film, but even he can't make up for silly situations and otherwise poor acting."

","This is not the first time, the IMDb rating in no way represents the quality of the movie. I really have doubts that so many people are that dumb, so i guess the rating is manipulated. The story: well, never seen so many clichés at one time. After the first 15 minutes it gets ridiculous and every new scene enforces the feeling that the producers tried to make a persiflage of the understanding of life of many U.S. peoples (or IMDb raters :). ""This cant be serious"" is the mantra of that movie. So if you want to know how bad old Europe is and how good, nice and brave the Americans then go on and watch it.

","Taken doesn't claim to be anything more than it is - a kidnap thriller with a revenge-fueled father who has more than a few tricks up his sleeve. Maybe that's it's saving grace. If it had tried to suggest it was pushing any envelopes, then anyone who'd seen any 007 film or watched 24 would object.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson does do a fantastic job in the role of super-dad, and the first moments when the tension kicks in are memorable - if a little clichéd. The action is fairly solid, though no ""wow"" moment that sets it apart. Like the Bourne Identity the scenes are cut quickly, so it's often hard to tell who's hitting who and how hard. The plot is mildly engaging, but formulaic. Even the ""resourcefulness"" of Neeson's character is nothing more impressive than later seasons of 24.<br/><br/>All in all I felt a bit robbed coming out of it - it's a big pile of ""so-so"". Having said that, if you just want a mindless thriller for a first date and it doesn't matter if it's particularly memorable, you could go far worse."
"tom-456","4","6","12","1 February 2009"," A truly lame excuse for an action movie
","The problem with this movie is singular: an action movie needs to have good action sequences, but the action sequences in this movie are dreadful. It is difficult to say whether the directing is to blame, because whatever may have been in the raw footage was chopped up like Cole slaw by the time it reached the theater. If you have ever seen a bad action film where the action is filmed too closely such that all you see are arms and legs flying across the screen, and where the camera cuts are fast and quick to simulate real action, then you know what this movie is in essence. Throughout the movie, almost from start to finish, the character played by Liam Neeson is involved in physical, hand-to-hand combat. But you don't every actually see any of it. I would estimate that during these sequences, the average amount of time that any one camera angle remains in place is less than a full second. Chop, chop, chop. These fools evidently believe that they can have the actors do everything in slow motion and then during the editing, chop it all up in a way that makes it seem like real action. Well, it just doesn't work. This very trick, in fact, is the signature of a cheaply made action movie. If a movie such as this does not have good action, what else does it have? In this case, not much. Neeson never really shows much emotion, and that makes it difficult to identify with him as he tries to rescue his daughter. There isn't really anything that convinces us that he really cares about her, other than the fact that he goes to save her. Even when she is first taken, he does not show anger. This was probably intentional, but it was a bad decision, because he comes across like a stick of wood. Come to think of it, I don't recall Neeson every showing emotion in any movie, and on that basis, I would have to say that he is not a good actor. They could make a mask of him and let another actor wear it, and then dub in his voice later, and the effect would be much the same. As for the story, the movie that I was most reminded of as I sat there and waited for it to end, was a Charles Bronson movie made in the late eighties, titled, ""Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects"".<br/><br/>Bottom line, an action movie needs to have good action sequences, and the action sequences in this movie are very badly done. You cannot get good action sequences by filming actors while they perform choreography in slow motion and then chop up the film later to hide the fact that they were in fact performing choreography in slow motion. It just doesn't work. This is a cheaply made, inferior action movie."

","Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has retired from his job, and is trying to reconnect with his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). He is divorced from her mother, Lenore (Famke Janssen), and has basically been a ghost to her while she is growing up. Kim gets the chance to go to stay in Paris for a few weeks with a friend, but needs parental permission before leaving. Bryan reluctantly signs off, but under many strict conditions, including calling him when they arrive. He finally gets a hold of her, only to listen to her being kidnapped. He vows to find her, and use all of his ""skills"" to do it.<br/><br/>It may not sound like much, but the trailer for Taken looked interesting, and sounded even better. But after seeing this all occur in the first twenty minutes, it leaves a lot to be desired for the next hour.<br/><br/>The film, action movie or not, has virtually zero character development. In my brief description, I basically give away everything you learn about Bryan and Kim. Sure, there is a throwaway bit about Kim's intentions in Europe (which are completely unrealistic in 2009), and vague proddings at what Bryan used to do. We obviously have an idea of the type of work he was in from the way he moves, and these skills he speaks of early on, but never anything that really furthers our knowledge of him. It works in the way of him being a bit of an enigma to the audience, and really surprising everyone with what he can do, but it makes the film that much less believable.<br/><br/>The story itself, looks like it was just culled together from half-hearted movies previous, and any form of surreal, overly choreographed action genre picture from the last ten years. No The Matrix does not take a ripping here, but anything featuring Jet Li, Jason Statham and the like does. Hell, I have not even seen Banlieue 13 (or District 13 as we better know it in North America), and I know this movie is stealing from it. Taken even throws in some torture scenes just to leave no post-9/11 stone untouched. Have action films gotten so stale that you can easily tell which pieces of other films got thrown into a blender to create this one? Is it really that hard to create something as unique or at least vaguely different like Wanted, Iron Man, or even The Dark Knight? Even No Country for Old Men has more interesting action scenes. It just feels like we have seen it all before, but the film tries to make it feel more original by throwing Neeson, an actor who has done such varied work in his career, into the mix.<br/><br/>The editing, in a sense, makes and breaks the film. On one hand, the film is never boring. It moves at such a rapid rate that you may find standing up to leave even faster than you sat down. Sure, the film adds in an entirely unneeded subplot about a popular singer (Holly Valance) and completely does away with Kim's friend Amanda (Katie Cassidey) all too easily. But the shell of a one-dimensional, point A to point B film that is left over is quite easy to just sit through without drifting off. The film moves at such a hyper-kinetic pace that it will leave you virtually no time to breathe or take anything in (if you can even manage to see the majority of the action scenes as it is). And with such a shoddily written plot, that may work out in the filmmakers' favour.<br/><br/>I think what it comes down to, is that I just expect more from Luc Besson. Since The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc he has done very little directing, and has spent more time writing. And looking at his writing credits, it is easy to see where a lot of films since have gotten their sense of action. But Besson is stronger than that. Look no further than The Fifth Element, Nikita (La Femme Nikita) or one of my own favourite action movies, Léon (The Professional). The man is a visualist who I imagine can write almost as well as he can direct. Thinking this, why has Taken fallen so far from these other three films? Yes, Element and Nikita are nowhere near the brilliance of Léon, but they had a very genuine feel and style missing from almost every film Besson has written since (with exceptions to the heavily underrated Danny the Dog (Unleashed) and even to a small point, The Transporter). Has he really lost the touch after so short a period of time? <br/><br/>Neeson does what he can with what he is given (read: not much). For such a vastly underdeveloped character, he makes him work and feel human. We feel his pain as he struggles to find his daughter, and we can see the remote expressions he gives suggesting what this guy must have gone through in all his years. It is his most subtle performance in years, and he deserves credit for breathing such life into the character. The movie rests on his shoulders, and never once does he take it for granted. I only wish he could have picked something better to act in, the man is not going anywhere near an Oscar with movies like this.<br/><br/>The supporting cast does what is needed and nothing more unfortunately. Again, chalk it up to the film being an action movie.<br/><br/>I was vaguely intrigued by Taken, and if you do not expect much, you will not be disappointed. It has some nice action scenes, and Neeson makes you believe in his character. If you go in looking for any brain or substance though, you should keep on looking. Maybe rent Léon instead.<br/><br/>4/10."

"reginaszymczak","4","4","7","22 April 2013"," Top 500? Really?
","Taken had the potential to be a really great action movie. The premise really intrigued me as I love movies about revenge and retaliation, people recalling on forgotten skills (Thank you, Sayid Jarrah) and movies starring tall, British men. What I liked was that Liam Neeson, despite his gangly running, was believable as a man capable of all the drastic measures we were witnessing. I also liked that there were some truly unexpected instances of brutality. An unwieldable tunnel vision is the only thing that is believable and acceptable when somebody is fighting for the life of their child.<br/><br/>But man, did I have some problems. The first was in regards to the female characters. Now, before certain male compadres try to tell me that I'm being a whiny feminist they should know that I'm relatively traditional myself and actually enjoy certain traditional male-female roles and customs. I will always appreciate a door opened, an arm given or a jacket offered. However, the first thing that I did when I got home was to check and see if the writers of this were male.<br/><br/>They were.<br/><br/>It would be wrong of you to assume that I think that every male writer doesn't understand women and are all stuck in a medieval outlook on our gender as a whole. But the three women in the film were exactly as follows:<br/><br/>1. THE CRONE ex-wife 2. THE TRAMP friend (blond of course) who causes all the trouble 3. THE MADONNA daughter whose virginity is at stake as each minute passes by<br/><br/>I know it happens and it's part of the DNA of many, many action movies but I'm sorry... one of these days we'll have to get past this. If James Bond is capable of evolving from one-dimensional females, anybody is.<br/><br/>The dialog itself was pretty weak. For example, the daughter finally asks her father specifically what his job was. ""I'm a preventer"" he says. ""What do you prevent?"" she asks wide-eyed. ""Bad things from happening."" There was also a BBQ with some old ""black-op"" buddies that was good for nothing else but disposing of expository information. The best part of the film is a pretty decent speech delivered by a good actor which was done ten times better by Mel Gibson in Ransom that everybody has already seen in the preview. Things go his way through 99.9% of the film; pipes break at an opportune time, mud splashes in an opportune place, a reflection appears at an opportune angle... I was starting to believe that Neeson's character was just incredibly lucky rather than exceptionally skilled, especially since out of the ninety Albanians he took out none of them, even with machine guns, could hit water if they fell out of a boat.<br/><br/>There's always an unspoken request for a suspension of belief when dealing with an action hero's unbelievable luck. If a movie is done well it's something I will do gladly. I just couldn't do it this time. Not with Jason Bourne still on the loose.<br/><br/>P.S. Over the years, I have learned that there are certain times where I can tell that nobody wants to hear my honest opinion unless I'm about to agree with them. Tonight, I sensed that this would be one of those times so when my male companions asked if I liked it I safely respond with my default answer: ""I was entertained."""

","Excellent entertainment AND an emotional relief despite the fact that practically ALL the elements are the recycled moves and takes from Bond and Bourne movies. The difference is that love for a daughter - so genuinely performed by Neeson and staged/edited by Morel and his crew - makes the watching experience so griping and charged. Although the superman's abilities are pretty unbelievable (not unlike in the mentioned above other ones') - you watch it with absorption and participation that makes you almost jittery with excitement and suspense. That's another paradox - in a predictable in practically all the aspects film - suspense. What a miracle creativity presents! <br/><br/>The other somewhat subtler line is relationship between Brian and Lenore charged with anger and regret - and back to anger. His work vs. his family life. His regret and guilt for not being there for his wife and daughter. As trivial as it might be - the line has been literally in the thousands of films - it creates the charge that propels the story development into a paradox of cookie-cutter elements composing a quite uniquely emotional thriller."

Now that he's ""retired,"" cooking steaks and drinking beers with his buddies, the biggest goal in his life is to re-establish and re-connect with his recently turned 17 year old daughter.<br/><br/>When Bryan agrees with his ex-wife and makes a torturous decision to allow his daughter and her friend to travel across the globe alone, to ""check out the museums in Paris,"" when she arrives, if you did not already know by the title, she's taken.

He can do anything, even obtain a full medical kit in just a cut of a scene. Then everything he was after is saved, he's the hero, and everyone forgets how he was the ""***hole"" just an hour and a half ago.<br/><br/>As the writing behind the project showed a select few believable occurrences and original concepts (the torture method, the cab driver, and the result of Peter), they were foreshadowed by lines of weak dialog and cliché filled action and characters. Unnecessary flashbacks, which where implemented to create added suspense in the audience did the complete opposite; re-showing us action that just occurred does nothing but dim the suspense by showcasing more detail. And, it's a way for the director and post-production crew to attempt the overplayed flashback, filled with bright lights and quick cuts that remind of pop music videos - developed for those in the crowd with attention disorders.<br/><br/>But, kudos to the director, Pierre Morel, for showcasing a variety of hand-held action and fight sequences that were presented nearly perfect. It was the highlight of direction and cinematography in this film, but really, the only plus.<br/><br/>The sound - below average. Throwing in over-the-top sound effects to compliment and better showcase the action just doesn't work. Yes, Liam Nesson is a bad a**, but the sound of his punches should not replicate and make me think ""Hulk SMASH!"" This movie is one of the better flicks you'll see during these months of the year. It's, for the most part, enjoyable. If your an action buff, like to see a one guy kick a**, and don't want to spend a lot of time asking logical questions - you will like it.

Plot holes or violation of physical laws are acceptable to me, as long as I don't feel messed around with. So while I have no problem with Bourne or James Bond movies, Taken is an entirely different caliber...<br/><br/>Let us imagine you were an experienced ex secret agent specialized in anti-terrorism. You still got excellent contacts to other agents. Now imagine your daughter was kidnapped by brutal human traffickers in a foreign country...<br/><br/>... do you go alone without backup or do you alert some friends? Just in the case, you know, that you are killed and no one is left to save your daughter or something like that?<br/><br/>Now let's imagine you identified a suspect...<br/><br/>... do you ambush him in bright daylight and violently shove him into a public taxi and start to torture him in the backseat right in front of an international airport, or do you at least follow him for a while, so you might not draw not unwanted attention and easily gather more info about the suspect and his contacts?<br/><br/>Furthermore imagine you actually captured the last surviving bad guy, after you killed all of his buddies, which unfortunately makes his knowledge the only chance left to find your daughter...<br/><br/>... do you torture him with subcutaneous electrodes and 110 volts of alternating current (9 volts from a battery can kill you when the current is applied subcutaneous) coming right away from the power grid and risk to kill your only source of information?<br/><br/>... do you kill said bad guy right after the first answer he gives you without verifying its truth?<br/><br/>... would you repeat same procedure (killing of your only source of information before verification of his statements) ?<br/><br/>If you answered all questions above with yes, congrats you perfectly qualify for the CIAs anti terrorism branch.<br/><br/>This movie is completely based on an ignorant, close minded world view filled with exceptional examples of stupidity: Human traffickers go routinely after people right in front of the Paris airport. The classical super zoom image enhancement (which is about as believable as outrunning a nuclear explosion) is taken to a new level here: A roadside automate does what the CSI at least needs a computer lab for. <br/><br/>Taken tries hard to look ""badass"" and clever.

The movie begins with Liam attending his daughter's birthday party at her home, which looks a lot like the Villa Borghese. The daughter goes to Paris with a friend and is kidnapped by some Albanian mafia types, to be sold into a prostitution ring. The rest of the movie is Liam opening up several jars of whoopass on the bad guys. It was lucky for Liam that the Albanians were terrible shots.

"Mr_Saxon","8","7","15","26 July 2008"," Thrilling
","For the first fifteen minutes or so, you are convinced that ""Taken"" is just going to be another run-of-the-mill action movie, albeit with a strange choice of action hero. We meet Bryan (Liam Neeson) who seems quite ordinary, as he attempts to hold onto his relationship with the daughter (Maggie Grace) who lives with his ex-wife. He takes a brief job as a bodyguard and we see a glimpse of something extraordinary about Bryan when the girl he is protecting is attacked. So far though, the movie is pretty average.<br/><br/>But then his daughter is kidnapped in Paris and that's when the entire movie moves up about five gears.<br/><br/>Although there are certain plot holes in the story, if you're looking for something to satisfy your craving for action in the style of the Bourne movies, then you're going to forgive those and go along for the ride. And what a ride it is! Once Bryan arrives in Paris, the concerned father persona gives way to another; a terrifying whirlwind of fury which will do anything to get back what was taken from him. Legs are broken, faces destroyed, rounds of gunfire are emptied into fleeing men and torture is employed. If you thought a 56 year old Liam Neeson would be slower and less impressive than a 32 year old Matt Damon, you'd be dead wrong.<br/><br/>Once the main storyline of ""Taken"" began, I found my eyes glued to the screen. You see, Neeson does two things here - firstly, he completely sells the audience the fact that he is a father who will go to any lengths to get his daughter back alive. You see the concern in his eyes when he learns who has taken her and you see the absolute, unconditional love he has for her. Secondly, he convinces you that he really does possess the ""particular set of skills"" he warns one of the kidnappers about. You've seen Neeson in many movies but you've never quite seen him like this. The scene where he takes out an entire den of kidnappers at high speed by stabbing and shooting people before they barely have a chance to react is a particular highlight.<br/><br/>In summary, ""Taken"" is one of the best action movies of 2008. Give it a chance and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable it is."

Famke Janssen cant play anything but gold digger sharon stone types and plays the part of the snide Ex wife most excellently. Liam was his usual self somewhat unrealistic role in an unrealistic film based on divorce, lies, ignorance and snide remarks about the past. Maggie Grace simply in her element in this film. While her acting was credible and realistic she just cant play any other role than the spoiled little ignorant brat but it suited this shallow film perfectly. Directors/writers often reach for the divorce plot in a sad means to add depth and meaning to each character in the film but all they do is recycle the Mrs Doubtfire theme. Oh look.. in this one mommy taught daughter how to lie with a smile right in her EX dad's face. How sweet!<br/><br/>PLOT Add an ageing low budget actor to play daddy. Add spoiled clueless two faced child / children. Add gold digger wife full of smarmy snide comments. Get Ex daddy to run about doing crazy unrealistic stuff for his EX family. Make the EX wife ignore it all and end the film without so much as a thank you. Oh.. and Make sure wife gets last word in film.<br/><br/>I saw this plot already 50 times and the actors seemed to be playing characters from other films / shows. Hence it's getting an awful 1 / 10 vote. The ending was seriously lacking any emotion value at all. She walks off with HER daughter without any recognition that all of trouble was her fault and without so much as a thank you to her ex who risk his life to correct her mistakes and save HER daughter. Very sad film.. not in a good way.<br/><br/>Shame on you Luc Besson & Pierre Morel extra shame on you! Stick to low budget ""action"" films.

","The action scenes of this movie are terrific and enjoyable but they are in the service of some very nasty ideological messages: sex-trafficking is simply a displacement of America's paranoid war on terror, in which the revenge plot gives the audience a fantasy solution to the mess of Iraq and Afghanistan. The choice of Albanian villains is cunning as it conveniently blurs the distinction between post-Communist and Muslim 'threat', and the choice of Paris as a centre of white slavery and police collusion is patently a retaliation for French resistance to the neo-con agenda. And while the fact that the hero is also a father allows the audience to sympathise with his increasing desperation, his daughter is clearly a symbol of America's elite social class: in time-honoured fashion, she is the virginal princess who has to be rescued from the clutches of immoral foreign (Eastern) baddies (the idea that sex-traffickers would kidnap a rich American tourist for other purposes than ransom is laughable). If we believe this movie, George Bush's tax-cutting pampering of the rich has clearly failed to make America's upper middle classes feel secure: better not step out of the country, and lock up your (millionaire) daughters, the only ones worth saving. This is a backlash movie: anti-feminist (it is no coincidence that the daughter's travelling companion declares her promiscuous intentions before she is 'taken' - this is propaganda for abstinence), anti-liberal (good America v evil outside 'threats'), anti-Bourne trilogy (let's stop demonizing the CIA! ), and socially exclusive. If you thought the use of torture was indefensible, this movie will set your mind at rest. Why are such invidious films made? Does it have anything to do with the corporate ownership of Hollywood?"

It wasn't plausible in any way and reminded me rather of a violent Lifetime movie. And that isn't a complete euphemism, I mean the casting and acting reminded me of Lifetime. I kept thinking, ""why did Liam Neeson agree to do this? Didn't he learn from 'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace'?"" I guess at the end of the day, it's all about paying the bills so you can live next month (or maybe in his case, the next YEAR). His daughter was way too old to be playing a convincing teenager. The karaoke machine vs. pony-for-a-birthday present is so played-out. His friends don't look like anything bouncers/security dudes at all (especially Leland Orser). Not to mention that they're so well-mannered when they're kicking back drinking and barbecuing- no swearing or anything! So far-fetched about tracing the bad guys voice over a cell phone. And shooting the French detective's wife- are we still supposed to root for this guy? He just shot an innocent woman. Is this to show us how ""tough"" and ""ruthless"" he is? Liam Neeson is no Bruce Willis or Steven Seagal (and I'm saying that because those guys are a helluva lot more convincing as action heroes than Neeson). But, oh well.

Breezy entertainment for the 60-or-so minutes when Neeson's crusading Paris and sniffs his daughter's justice, but this experience is mainly a big load of Jack Bauer envy, and there's loads of unintentional laughs and tiresome frustrations throughout, and I can't really see it as an enjoyable second watch.

","Bryan Mills is a former spy now working high profile security events. He's divorced and still tries to find time for his teenage daughter Kim. She wants to go to France for a holiday, he warns against it, because of how dangerous Europeans are? Eventually he gives in and allows her to go on condition she rings him every night. Off she goes and forgets to ring home, Bryan is worried, but eventually gets her on the phone, but while talking to her, she sees her roommate being kidnapped by masked men inside their apartment, thinking quickly Bryan tells her what to do, to describe everything she sees so that he can trace them if she is ""taken"" too. Sure enough they find her and Bryan tells the kidnappers over the phone that he is going to find them and kill them all. While watching this Luc Besson produced film, I couldn't help but think of that line from Pulp Fiction, ""when you positively have to kill every last Motherf@cker in the room, "" well get Bryan Mills, he'll do all the hard work for ya, for he keeps his word, he goes to Europe and does kill every last Motherf@cker. It's a similar theme to Besson's own film Leon, a deadly assassin killing everybody in sight, but Taken really is based on a very flimsy premise, having said that, it really does exactly what it says on the tin, the problem with that is the film is very linear, as he tracks down the kidnappers/white slave traders, each one is given short shrift, they're dead within seconds, we never get to know any of the bad guy's. Mills is never even in peril, there is no rematch with a bad guy, we only get to know them all very briefly. If you're into brainless shoot em up's you won't be disappointed with this, I enjoyed it myself on those levels to some extent, but it is still quite a poor film. Neeson does make for a great hero though."

The best way to sum up this movie is to say it is a slightly better Steven Seagal movie...and i don't think that is much of a compliment. It was too unbelievable, even for an action movie. Never once did i believe Liam's character was in danger. He could seemingly read minds, was an expert in absolutely everything and had such intelligence that the CIA was jealous. He could be in a small room with five bad guys with guns, but somehow is able to defeat them all without a scratch. Luckily for him, the bad guys couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with their guns. Just ridiculous. I gave it a 4/10. The stars I gave it came from decent acting by Neeson and Famke Jannsen and good production value. It DID look good: good special effects and cinematography.

His motivation this time borders cliché and unique, because it's not overused but not wholly original. Actually, it's somewhat reminiscent of ""Man on Fire"". His character doesn't develop throughout the movie, except perhaps to become more and more assertive (shooting a friend's wife in the arm and threatening her life to get what he wants), but it's not particularly necessary to develop the theme of fatherhood given its inherent complexity. The action was great, the acting was pretty good across the board (Neeson was great IMO), and the direction was effective.<br/><br/>I only have two major gripes.<br/><br/>1) Nothing happened regarding the friend after she died. In fact, there was no followup about the trading ring at all. I think there should have been some.<br/><br/>2) There were only about 2 minutes in which Neeson appeared helpless.

One of the main problems is that this mindless action flick sees itself as a smart action/thriller/drama ala Man On Fire, which it most certainly is not. If the movie had embraced it's ridiculousness and not taken itself so seriously it could have been a decent (at best) popcorn movie. Liam Neeson (who I think is great in almost anything he does) is completely miscast as a one man army, punching and kicking his way through over 40 much younger, fitter, stronger men. This is not Bourne, this is not Bond, and it most definitely is not Man On Fire, this is a second rate PG-13 Rambo, with watered down violence and the heavy themes sugarcoated beyond belief to protect the fragile minds of film goers brought up on the idea that things really aren't that bad in the world and good will always defeat evil no matter how badly the odds are against them.

","I shouldn't be writing a comment on this movie. I don't typically go to ""action"" movies because car chases and fights just don't do it for me. I want a good plot and twists or at least a very compelling story that either makes you laugh or makes you think about something worthwhile in life. The ""story"" of this movie didn't seem to be the point to me. They just had to have some vehicle to package the car chases and fights in, so they came up with a basic, almost trite, father saves daughter storyline.

","This film is much alike to the Bourne films, including that the main character is a US secret agent who is very much alone as he takes on impossible numbers of heavily armed bad guys. I would have rated it four stars except for a few glaring faults; My initial reaction to this was that it was quite good but was a little heavy on the violence and bloodshed. Unlike Bourne, it seems like the main character in this film would rather kill or torture rather than talk his way out of situations & actually takes some joy in hearing people scream. I am not sure how it got away with PG-13 in the States & I actually think that the UK's 15 rating was a little slack too.<br/><br/>The violence begins with the agent entering France and ends with his departure. That was a bit disturbing, especially since when he returns people are acting as if life is back to normal and that nothing really happened in-between. There are a few other loose ends which the film glosses over poorly as well.<br/><br/>The film is almost written as an anti-Bourne. Whereas Bourne takes on the corrupt CIA and battles against mostly US agents, this film features a ""who's who"" of people that the US does not like. The baddies include French, Eastern Europeans, and even Arabs. The way that the film portrays the French authorities in particular is pretty insulting."

The French allow her to be hijacked by Albanian communists in order to be transformed into the liberal whorish ideals of Europe, for the ultimate purpose of being deflowered by a large, fat Arab Muslim terrorist. <br/><br/>Fortunately, America (played by Liam Neeson) jumps in and handles the situation by blowing the brains out of many, many people and implementing the use of ""advanced interrogation"" techniques on the evil-doers. The reckless, gung-ho ends-justify-the-means American philosophy saves the day, and American culture is rescued from the Arab terrorist.<br/><br/>Afterwards, the American ideals are taken back to the homeland and given the chance to fulfill the American dream by achieving superficial fame in Hollywood.

"C-Younkin","7","3","5","27 January 2009"," Taken with ""Taken""
","After meeting a cute guy in the airport, a teenage girl proclaims, ""I'm going to sleep with him"" to her best friend. It's in these opening moments that ""Taken"" is very unnerving, showing naïve teenagers ready to cut loose from mom and dad only to discover that there is a darker side to the beauty of the international world. Yet this movie is an actioner from France filmmaker Luc Besson, known more for escapist entertainment like ""The Transporter"" and ""The Professional"", so its safe to say the seriousness of it starts and ends with that. This movie comes from a very real place, but its pure popcorn. The screenplay is by Besson and writing partner Robert Mark Kamen and cinematographer Pierre Morel makes his English-language debut behind the camera, and despite some things that go over the line, it gets the job done.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, who we can assume did some pretty shady, black-op type things for the government. Now divorced and retired, he finds himself competing for the attention of his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) with her new richer father (Xander Berkeley), while being constantly at odds with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen). Against his better judgment he allows Kim to go on a vacation with a friend to Paris and as if he predicted it, he receives a call from Kim right as kidnappers are taking her friend and coming after her. From piecing together the background noise he overhears, he places them as an Albanian group with their hand in drugs and the sex trade. It's up to him to fly to Paris and put his ""particular set of skills"" to good use in order to save his daughter.<br/><br/>What follows is really a string of martial arts, gun battles, explosions, and car chases. The movie goes by in a brisk hour and 25 minutes and for the most part it's a well-made thriller with a good central performance from Liam Neeson. It's his show for most of the movie. Besson isn't interested in the heartbreak of the parents back home or what horrible things the girls being preyed on are suffering. Even the villains remain off-screen and one-dimensional for most of the time, unless Neeson is beating the bloody crap out of them. What Besson (and I'm sure the people looking to see this movie) is interested in is an intimidating badass who knows how to kick-ass and take names without mercy and Neeson covers that and more. He also shows the sadness and finds the humanity in a man desperately trying to find his daughter.<br/><br/>What bothered me about this movie though is the torture angle. I know the last thing your supposed to do is look for morality in what's basically a revenge fantasy but there are times when you just feel like Mills goes too far. Electrocuting a man for the schere joy of watching him suffer or shooting an innocent woman in the arm so as to get information from someone else isn't entertaining or the stuff that makes him particularly rootable. ""Taken"" works in the same vain as ""Out for Justice"" and is, for the most part, a fairly thrilling revenge flick, just sometimes it gets too carried away and crosses a line that you wish it knew not the cross."

The main character Liam Nesson doesn't look very convincing as a slick killer with wrinkly face and dimensions of a man more fit to be working in a garden with his grandchildren rather than taking on trained militants.<br/><br/>What i did like about the movie was its fast pace and good direction which makes up for a feeble script and cast.

I was expecting Arnie to show up at any minute.<br/><br/>In stead of Schwarzenegger Liam Neeson is starring, though. He plays a special-agent-whatever-kicker-of-asses whose daughter gets into the hands of evil Albanians. That's right: evil Albanians. Like in the 80's, the bad guys are just from some little country the audience knows nothing about, except that it's probably populated by EVIIIIIILLLL people.<br/><br/>Anyway, Neeson (I forget his character's name) is that typical father that only exists in Hollywood: He totally loves his daughter Kim and is always there for her, but his ex-wife just won't acknowledge all his love and concern, because of his absence in the past or whatever. Wifey has already found a new boyfriend, a rich guy who's able to buy Kim more expensive presents than Neeson... like a pony... a pony for a 17 year old-girl. Yeah, you go make sense of it.<br/><br/>Anyway, when asked to agree that Kim goes on a trip to Paris over the summer, Neeson in all his special agent-educational wisdom rejects his allowance at first knowing that the world is a bad place and not one for a 17 year old-girl and her 19 year old-friend to travel. However, in the end Kim and her mother bitch until Neeson finally lets his daughter go... Oh, boy, had they better listened to good ol' Spy Dad. Within the very first minutes in Paris the girls get abducted, of course, and Neeson has to go overseas to get them back.<br/><br/>""Taken"" is full of clichés, from the wooden dialog, to the depiction of teenagers (17 year olds who love ponies, 19 year olds who have never had sex, girls who are fans of U2 and Holly Valance at the same time) up to a plot that just falls into place a little too neatly (much too neatly). The hero is a Dad with superpowers. Bullets magically miss him, while the ones coming from him hit their targets every time. We've seen this before and better BUT: It's a concept that never gets old, isn't it? And, well, the movie is very entertaining. It moves along quickly and the 90 minutes rush by in an instant.<br/><br/>""Taken"" is not quite as stupid as ""The Transporter"", but then it's not choreographed as stunningly, either. It's just an old school action flick for anybody who's willing to turn off the old brain and watch Oskar Schindler kick some butt."

","It's one of the best movies I ever watched in this year. It tells you what a real man should act, what a father should act. Although, in some point of views he is doing things against the law, but if it was me,I would do the same. When anyone of your family is in dangerous, and when you can not rely on the government, you should action quickly and use all your skills to fight for them. But of course,in real life most of us have no such skills as his,but it doesn't matter,the choices you make do matter. The movie has actions and gun fires but not bloody or too much violence,your heart is following him all through the time.Really a nice movie, no wasting a single second,hope all of you like it."

","This is one of the best films I have ever seen, most defiantly this year at least. Liam Neeson is as I hinted at in my summery the real Dark Night, in this film he shows us the true side of a man pushed to breaking point which then leads to total destruction of the bad guys. To this I add that the film Batman Begins which also stared Liam Neeson was in a sense owned by him, it wasn't until I saw this film that I realized just how good he was in that film, I have to admit I haven't seen the Dark Night yet but I'm willing to lay down a few quid to say it isn't as good as the last Batman, and it isn't as good as Taken.<br/><br/>There was only one bad point in this movie and that was when he takes out the spotter! Why? All he had to do was let the blond be taken and he could have followed them to the crib where the girls were being kept. That said he wasn't really at any point in the mood for messing around.<br/><br/>If you love Batman, then you will like this film, if you liked Batman Begins and thought it was good because of the new Batman (Christian Bale) or the new Batmobile or new insight into the super hero known as Bruce Wayne. I think you might be a little disappointed because it is clear from this movie Liam Neeson was the bad guy that made Batman look good in Begins. I cant help but feel I'm going to watch The Dark Night and think about this film.<br/><br/>To be honest I don't really need to sell this film to you, the 7.5 should do that for you, I do admit there are weak points in the movie but boy did the movie move along at a rapid entertaining pace. Good watch!, by the DVD, go to the movies, or download this movie you will watch it more than a few times."

The world depicted here's so bloody brutal, perhaps Neeson's straight forward uncharismaticness is right for it. He's a reliable lead regardless, just unlikely to give someones favourite performance. The girls may act naive, but they were willing to be picked up by the stranger and go to a unknown party, so they were going to end up in this situation regardless if they were staying with anyone and probably even if they were careful.

Honestly at some points I wish she was killed off! Liam is the sensible, level headed dad we all wanted, who tried to warn his daughter and the mother of the dangers that could happen when young girls travel by themselves overseas, but of course they never listened and at the start they tried to guilt Liam''s character as a ""mean dad"" who is smothering his daughter. The best payback was when Liam stormed back to the ex''s house and took charge as an alpha male after finding out his daughter was kidnapped, and seeing the ex shut her mouth for once, because she realized Liam was right all along.

TAKEN is another solid action movie that has soul and resonates well. Luc Besson is really skilled at crafting powerful action stories and has not disappointed here.

It's not a very long film and keeps you glued till the end.<br/><br/>TAKEN has a heartfelt story, and further, heartfelt performances.

You will root for him, you will want him to win and this is where lies one of the biggest successes of the makers.<br/><br/>Action is one of the strongest aspects of the film, as we're given fights, gunplay and chases which aren't just well choreographed but also backed by strong emotions. Dialogues are great, and you most probably would be knowing which ones I specifically mean here. Cinematography is well done. Editing is absolutely top notch.<br/><br/>TAKEN is one of the finest gems of the French action cinema.

"TheLittleSongbird","6","2","3","25 January 2018"," Neeson turns action hero
","'Taken' garnered mixed to average reviews critically and still is, looking at the reviews here, a film that divides audiences. Can see both sides, being one who was mixed to moderately liked the film. It is interesting for being one of Liam Neeson's first endeavours as an action hero, and considering that the trailer was an intriguing one and Neeson has always been very watchable and often very good the potential was there.<br/><br/>As was said regarding 2011's 'Unknown' recently, 'Taken's' potential wasn't fully lived up to. Enough of 'Taken' does work, or at least to me it did (not everybody will agree and that's fine by me), but also from personal opinion what could have been a pretty good film turned out to be an above average but uneven one that could have done much more with what it had. It entertains and intrigues, but doesn't wow. <br/><br/>Really liked the rawness and slickness of the way 'Taken' was shot and edited, and the bleakness and grit of the rest of the production values suited the tone and genre perfectly. It's nicely scored, not intrusive but having presence, and the direction is solid.<br/><br/>There is enough taut suspense and fun to keep one gripped and the violence is uncompromisingly brutal and leaves one biting the nails. The sound effects are thrilling in authenticity and will leave one wincing in shock, with it adding hugely to the harrowing effect of the action. Neeson is a very commanding presence on screen and there is energy to the directing.<br/><br/>It is a shame though that, excepting Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen, the rest of the cast fail to match him or engage, being largely indifferent. The script also doesn't excite, descending into too much cheese and tedium and tending to lack clarity, subtlety.<br/><br/>Despite it being fun, slick, gritty and generally taut, the story is far too predictable and gets far too far-fetched and over-the-top in the latter stages. The violence, while thrilling and well done on its own, tends to overpower the basic drama of the story, so things feel unbalanced. The characters are pretty sketchy.<br/><br/>Overall, above average but uneven and more a mixed to moderately liked sort of film. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

It reminded me of Hostel (2005) but instead of intense gore there was a forced into prostitution theme. There were moments of utter silliness where the story was boring and other moments where the story was stupid. It did ramp up to full on excitement and shock. Shocking with one amazing action scene but overall flawed too much to fully enjoy."

It was good to see Liam Neeson after a long time. Having seen his best films: Darkman and Rob Roy, I was in eager expectations. <br/><br/>The film is relentless from start to finish with superb action sequences and strong to-the-point dialogue.<br/><br/>Full Plot: Highly-skilled CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has retired in an effort to build a closer relationship with his teenage daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). His frequent absences made him a distant father and led to his divorce. Knowing Kim wants to be a singer, Bryan buys her an expensive karaoke machine for her 17th birthday, but he is upstaged by Kim's wealthy stepfather Stuart (Xander Berkeley), who surprises her with a horse.<br/><br/>Later, Bryan's former colleague, Sam (Leland Orser), hires him to help provide concert security for a popular young singer, Sheerah (Holly Valance). When Bryan saves her from a knife-wielding attacker, Sheerah gratefully offers to help with Kim's musical aspirations.<br/><br/>Bryan's ex-wife, Lenore, (Famke Janssen) and Kim persuade a reluctant Bryan into allowing Kim to travel to Paris with her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy) to visit museums. Bryan is angered to discover at the airport that the girls actually intend to follow a U2 concert tour throughout Europe, instead of it being a study abroad program like he was originally told.<br/><br/>In Paris, Kim and Amanda meet Peter (Nicolas Giraud), a charming young stranger who suggests sharing a taxi from the airport. Peter learns that they are staying alone in Amanda's cousins' apartment. After they part, Peter phones someone and passes along what he has learned.<br/><br/>While on the phone with Bryan, Kim sees men enter the apartment and abduct Amanda. Bryan starts recording the call, and instructs Kim to shout out information about the kidnappers when they come for her. Afterward, Bryan realizes that someone is listening on the phone and tells him that if they let his daughter go, he will drop the matter, but if not, ""I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."" The listener replies, ""Good luck.""<br/><br/>Bryan has Sam analyze the recording; he determines that the abductors are likely part of the Albanian Mafia, which specializes in sex slavery. He tells Bryan and Lenore of a grim statistic: if Kim is not rescued within 96 hours, chances are she will never be found.<br/><br/>When Bryan reaches Paris, he finds his first clue: a photograph of Peter on the memory card of Kim's cellphone. He finds Peter as he is after another victim at the airport. After a short chase, Peter is struck and killed by a truck. Bryan then turns to an old friend, Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin), previously a field agent of French Intelligence, but now working behind a desk.<br/><br/>Eventually, the trail leads to a construction site with a makeshift brothel. Posing as a customer, Bryan notices a semi-conscious prostitute who has his daughter's jacket. He rescues her, killing several gangsters in the process. The girl tells Bryan the address of the house where she met Kim. Bryan bluffs his way in, pretending to be a corrupt policeman looking for a bribe. He identifies Marko Ocha as the one he spoke to on the phone, takes him prisoner and kills the other crooks. Searching the house, he finds Amanda dead, apparently from a heroin overdose.<br/><br/>Bryan tortures Marko into revealing that, because Kim is a highly valuable virgin, she was sold to Patrice Saint-Clair (Gérard Watkins). He leaves Marko to die slowly from unending electric shocks. Needing more information, Bryan goes to Jean-Claude's home. Jean-Claude admits to accepting bribes to look the other way and tries to force Bryan at gunpoint to give up his search. Bryan shoots Jean-Claude's wife in the arm to pressure him into giving up Saint-Clair's address.<br/><br/>Bryan impersonates a police commissioner to enter an exclusive party at Saint-Clair's mansion. He locates a secret underground facility where a sex-slave auction is underway. Kim is the last offering. Bryan forces a buyer to purchase her, but he is knocked unconscious before he can get to her. He awakens handcuffed to a pipe. After learning Bryan's motive, Saint-Clair orders him killed and leaves. Bryan frees himself, kills Saint-Clair's henchmen, and forces Saint-Clair to divulge Kim's whereabouts before executing him.<br/><br/>Bryan sees Kim being forced onto a yacht. Bryan jumps aboard and dispatches the guards. He finds an Arab sheikh holding a knife to Kim's neck. The man starts threatening Kim's life, but before he could finish his sentence, Bryan shoots him in the head.<br/><br/>After they return to the United States, Bryan surprises Kim with a visit to Sheerah for an audition.<br/><br/>Verdict: an outstanding film overall reminiscent of Commando(1985) and Diehard(1988) in terms of action. A good purchase for your DVD collection."

He lives alone seeking to make up lost time for his 17 year old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) When Kim is granted with an opportunity to visit Paris with a friend, and needs Bryan's permission.

This is a fine debut by French director Pierre Morrel (although the success doesn't continue, see (or don't see) ""FROM Paris WITH LOVE"" and you'll see what I mean.)

Liam Neeson's ability to capture his character is second to none in this film. The story was similar to that of ""Man on Fire"", I enjoyed both films just as much. The plot is simple and keeps you focused on thrilling directing. Other films such as the ""Bourne Supremacy"" left you thinking ""What the hell just happened"", this film however is pure brilliance.

One most important one is to call him when she lands.<br/><br/>When she lands and goes to get into a cab, Kim and her friend Amanda meet a French young man quite interested in getting to know them. Offers them invites to a party and not missing a beat, Kim accepts. Much to Amandas disagreement.<br/><br/>When they arrive at the place they are staying the French man gets their address and leaves. Bryan is then home in America very concerned that Kim has not contacted him to say they have landed. He then calls her and asks out what's going on, and that's where it's all thrills from there.<br/><br/>{MAJOR SPOILERS} Whilst on the phone to her father Kim walks into another room, Amanda however is in the living room dancing to loud music, blocking out any noise. Kim then enters the bathroom across from where Amanda is and can see her through the windows. Suddenly she says men walk in and becomes very suspicious, they then take Amanda away and Kim is petrified at this moment.<br/><br/>She explains hysterically to Bryan what she has just witnessed over the phone and he instructs her what to do. She runs to another room and hides under the bed. She is then told by her father that they are going to take her and there is nothing she can do to stop them. But the one key thing he needs her to do is to shout out all descriptions of the men. Facial, clothes, nationality, pretty much appearance. While doing so she shouts and is dragged away, with the mobile phone still under the bed. Bryan stays on the phone to see if there is anything else he can hear. He then hears someone pick up the phone and says a few threatening words, it's quite a speech so I shall cut it a bit shorter: ""I don't know who you are, I don't know what you want. If you let my daughter go that will be the end of it. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."" A foreign man then replies with 'Good luck' That good luck is the key thing throughout most of the film, so take much notice of it.<br/><br/>If you are not gripped enough yet I suggest you go and rent the film yourself, better yet buy it.

"Eumenides_0","7","2","3","10 September 2009"," Liam Neeson as an Action Hero
","Taken is one of the most fast-paced action thrillers I've seen in a long time. It's 93 minutes of non-stop action, suspense and thrills as an ex-secret agent rages through Paris looking after his daughter, kidnapped to be sold in the sex industry.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson shows that, at the age of 57, he can surpass such characters as James Bond and Jason Bourne as the best, coolest, deadliest action hero of modern cinema.<br/><br/>Artistically speaking, Taken is not a great movie: the camera work and dialogue is unimpressive and the characters are as developed as they need to be to make the movie move on (Neeson's characters has a wide range of skills that pass off as characterisation). Movement is the major force behind this movie, its frantic pace never letting the viewer stop to think for a moment. But whereas I would despise that in a movie like Transformers, some quality in Taken makes me love it.<br/><br/>It's undoubtedly the story that makes the difference. Whereas most summer action movies are huge stories about nothing, Taken is a smaller, simpler, even heartwarming story about a father's love for his daughter. We sympathise with his loss and rage and rejoice in the pain and destruction he inflicts upon the villains.<br/><br/>This is escapist cinema at its best; I haven't been this thrilled and haven't cheered so much for a hero in such a long time, I felt I'd never again experience the joy of watching a good guy triumph in a movie. Fortunately movies like Taken keep getting made."

","Brilliant! I like that the lead isn't your branded movie-star. Passes well for a concerned father. It is fantastic that neither the new father nor the mother turned evil and undeserving of a good finish. Or did the script turn into a romance in the end. Glad the rescue was a success but I would have liked to see the star come away with even less injuries for a change; and perhaps even reason for a sequel. At least one of his buddies in the beginning could have assisted him along the way to make it more believable. But bravo! Missed it on the big screen, hired the flick; I'm about to buy the disc 'cause it's definitely a collectors' item!"

Liam Nesson is cruel, cool, cold and amazingly wonderful. This is no doubt one of his best roles. This film is all Nesson's. <br/><br/>The action-sequences are full of excitement, very credible and recalls the Bourne movies. The action is so realistic.

","Quiet divorce Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson,someone I figured was overdue for doing a movie like this and he doesn't disappoint!)lives a solitary life,pining only to stay close to his now near-adult daughter's life. His attractive ex(Famke Janssen,not minding to sacrifice her sexiness for grit)has re-married to a super rich guy,and he can give said daughter(Maggie Grace)anything she wants. Fortunately for our hero,she still wants--at least when she's not momentarily blinded by all the cool things she can get and do--her daddy's love and approval.<br/><br/>A long-coveted trip to France(that is semi-supervised,of course)is what Kim,the daughter,gets from her folks,despite her dad's misgivings. Sure enough,her and her friend's bags have settled on the Rue-de-Place hotel floors more than an hour when some brutish,swarthy thugs violently overtake both girls and leave only vague,residual clues to what they're gonna do with them.<br/><br/>Of course,said thugs didn't count on Kim's dad being an excellent spy,a ""fixer"" who has plenty of contacts and a wealth of skills in tracking and neutralizing hostile foes.<br/><br/>Director Luc Beeson(who,I'll be honest,I was not fully aware of helming this picture when I decided upon seeing it)may be stooping a bit by helming this pretty straight-forward action genre flick--the guy helm-ed the trippy,near-definition busting SciFi offering The Fifth Element for crying out loud!!--but he has a more than competent feel for the frenetic,fast-paced activity and story here. I cannot give this TOO high of marks simply because the whole run of this story has a few too many clichés and many,if not most viewers,will recognize the standard chain of events right away. Not to mention the near lack of character development(heck,even Neeson's character only gets a broad outline when you really think about it),this movie would seem to be shallow entertainment. Still,it's hugely satisfying and,at a blistering 93 minutes,it doesn't leave the viewer enough time to dwell on the show's deficiencies. Perhaps it's playing dirty pool with audiences,but this movie works on a very basic and involving level. At the risk of using the oh-so-ready word play supplied by the movie's title,I think Taken is an appropriate title for this punchy,effective ride of a film."
"FilmLabRat","7","2","3","17 March 2009"," fast-moving action thriller keeps surprising
","Good movie in many respects - twists and turns and fast-paced drivenness keep you on the edge of your seat. Neeson was great as usual. The actress cast as his daughter was too flighty and silly for my taste - I wouldn't let a hyperactive, over-emotional screaming-prone teen go to Europe, either. She acted like a tiny child without a thought. Anyway, I like how the film opened up with Neeson protesting the trip and also liked many of the mysteries along the way and his awkward but caring relationship with his silly daughter.<br/><br/>Don't think they should have included Neeson shooting the French police exec's wife's arm though - seemed incongruent with the character's moral bent and history with her. Point about sacrificing a family member is not well-made with faint apology afterward. <br/><br/>How is it that Neeson is instigating showers of gunshots and never takes a hit until right before finding his daughter? we don't even see him put on a bulletproof vest or see any reason to believe this at all. And what happened to the girl he rescued in order to sober her up and ask about his daughter? I'd like to see that thread sewn up, as long as we're dealing with as heavy a subject as sex trade - as long as we're taking on the social blight, why not some resolution to the system, somehow? At least a suggestion that there's a care beyond family. A few regrettable points where the script missed and perhaps overly choppy camera-work - do we have to become dizzy to get his frantic emotions? it's too forced. The ending is clapped on cliché - why not show the difficulties they would obviously have leaving the country in the wake of the father's blood-bath? And some deeper, wizened daughter. How is is that through all this, she doesn't even change? Yeah right. More character development is a must. Overall a fine story and nicely made film with important subject matter and potential for more thought.<br/><br/>Where have we seen this script before? Perhaps reworked in many scripts, but especially from 'Target' from the 80s starring Matt Dillon as the rebellious teen and Gene Hackman as the former FBI father who surprises his son with his know-how, savvy and worldly connections when the mother/wife is kidnapped? All teens need their parents to be a brave role-model, so this kind of film fulfills those fantasies. Plus a nod to social commentary on sex trade without sugar-coating makes this worth seeing."
"joeynuc","8","2","3","10 March 2009"," Great, Except For One Inaccuracy
","""Taken"" was a great blend of action and drama. The action scenes were not overly drawn out and silly, while the drama comes from the intense and very realistic aspect of ""sex slaves."" It contained a great mixture of believable characters and situations. The amount of violence, drug usage, and the reality that sex slave trade still exist may be too much for the average person to handle, but action movies are always better when there is truth and validity. I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates hard action with a serious plot. However, I would like to point out that there is one inaccuracy in the movie..there is no way that one man could kill that many Albanians. Albanians really are hardcore and really are deep in the underworld. All these movies that portray Albanians as criminals are not far-fetched nor are they cliché. It's just completely silly to believe that anyone could take out that many Albanians. Maybe if they were French or English I would believe it."
"iKramerica-1","6","2","3","28 February 2009"," Not bad, but get real
","This is not an 8.0 movie. The writing was horrible. It was if they just took the first draft of the script and said ""eh, good enough, letz shoot it, no?"" The first 15 minutes were so sappy/cliché it was frightening. You could even tell that Liam did not believe what he was saying. It almost looked like he was trying not to laugh at how stupid it was.<br/><br/>The Paris part was mostly good, but very unrealistic of course. How are all these people so bad at shooting guns? Seriously, it was worse than most action films in that respect. Machine guns at point blank range miss our hero over and over. Really, really silly.<br/><br/>If someone actually wants to see how eastern European (or Balkan) mobs work, see Eastern Promises. Once you watch that film, you'll find the structure of the Albanians in this film laughable.<br/><br/>But besides those short comings, it was an entertaining action film.<br/><br/>PS - maybe it's just the American in me, but shooting people in the back as they are running away, even bad guys, is not what a hero does, but it happens many times in this film."
"Chris Knipp","6","2","3","14 February 2009"," Bad Bourne
","Ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) used to specialize in stopping bad things from happening--expertly, we're to assume. Now he's retired to California to be near his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). That's a project, because Kim lives with Bryan's not-at-all-friendly ex-wife Lenore (Framke Jenson), and a very rich and generous stepfather, in an L.A. palace. When he appears at a grandiose birthday party at the house for the girl, it's clear he's not very welcome.<br/><br/>Kim wangles a trip to Europe with a girlfriend. Bryan, whose permission is required because she's only 17, doesn't like the idea at all. It ain't safe over there for a young American. Bryan's carer has taught him paranoia. He sees terrorists and perverts and all around bad guys everywhere, especially over in the Old Europe. Besides that, Kim is a virgin, and 17. Two essential setups for the plot, because giving his permission involves Bryan in the trip, and her being a virgin--well, see if your mind is paranoid enough to figure out what that means. Kim lies and begs and jumps up and down (Grace's performance consists mostly of jumping, acting terrified and comatose, then jumping again when it's all safely over). Bryan gives in reluctantly and signs a release.<br/><br/>But boy, was Bryan right. The minute Kim and her girlfriend arrive in Paris, they're kidnapped. It happens, in the manner of modern movies, when she's on her cellphone talking to Bryan. Then he makes the speech that is repeated in the trailers in which he instructs her to hide under a bed, and then get caught. I guess she can't jump out the window, the way he could.<br/><br/>And soon does, when he rushes over to Paris to rescue Kim and track down and on-the-spot execute the kidnappers. How he finds out they are Albanian slave traders and pimps and how he is in their lair threatening them in 24 hours or less is something you will more or less learn if you see the movie. Only more or less, because it's all a game, really, if a very violent one, and the connective tissue of the plot is frequently missing.<br/><br/>'Taken' is an excellent thrilling nonstop adrenaline-pumping exhilarating movie starring the accomplished Neeson. It's also a dumb unbelievable bigoted collection of disgustingly cruel scenes whose heavy-handed setups show utter contempt for the audience's intelligence. That might seem what we deserve for going to such a film just because it stars a man who convincingly played Oscar Schindler and Alfred Kinsey, Rob Roy and Michael Collins. At fifty-seven (and looking every minute of it) he also might just be a bit old for dropping rooms-full of bloodthirsty Albanians and heavily armed Saudis, jumping from building to building and outwitting the Paris police force, were he in real life actually to carry out such exploits in the few days during which all this happens. If that matters. This dubious aspect to the casting of the lead merely starts off the list of stunningly implausible details. Following the gospel according to Daniel Craig (his image, that is), macho action stars don't have to be suave or good looking. Do they have to have the physical conditioning and stamina to make ultra-physical action plausible? The makers of the Bourne franchise movies think so. That's why they've wisely cast the very fit, muscular, and still young Matt Damon in the role. But this is bad Bourne. Very bad Bourne. Unlike the Bournes' Paul Greenglass, Pierre Morel proves to be an efficient but mechanical director with very little flair.<br/><br/>You're not supposed to notice that casting incongruity. Neeson's a bit old for an action star, but he's still erect, tall (6'4"", actually) and elegant. He carries himself with cool confidence. It all slides by fast--too fast, finally, to remember much but the despicableness of the villains and the ruthless murderousness of the avenging CIA agent/dad. Pierre Morel, a French cameraman and cinematographer who broke into directing with the crackerjack B-Hollywoodish Paris ghetto action flick 'District 13' ('Banlieue 13'), has teamed up again with Euro shlockmeister Luc Besson, made a good movie out of this--well, except for the dumb writing. Even in actioners, writing is important. Note the interesting identity theme that unites the Bourne stories and their inspired use of breakneck location shifts. Following the S/X-free style of Morel's Parkur sequences in '13,' 'Taken' doesn't have a lot of state-of-the-art fakery, though its car chase scenes come early and often and totally without dramatic necessity. Mainly, what damns the whole effort is that the storytelling in is crude and obvious and full of holes, and the thinking is nasty.<br/><br/>This is a choice of which Neeson ought to be ashamed. And, as we shall see if we watch through to the end, it is another addition to Jack Shaheen's book 'Real Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People.' Because the Albanians are scumbags, but the absolutely most despicable villains are the Arabs at the end who actually purchase the young virgins to indulge their vile sexist lusts. But no matter: Bryan kills them ll, every one. He kills anybody who gets in his way too, even just people whose cars he needs for a chase scene. The mindless brutality of this film is, well, mind-boggling. And it all goes to reinforce jingoistic ideas that Americans are at war with ""evil"", and more or less with all the rest of the world, and anybody who gets in their way, including the Paris police force. And all to protect our dumb naive spoiled teenage rich girl virgins."

"dpg-87522","7","1","1","7 February 2020"," A entertainig action film.
","""Taken"" is a 2008 film, which was popular (the audience liked it a lot), which is in a nutshell that Liam Neeson who is a former CIA agent, will have to kill half a mob to save his daughter White's traffic. As the plot sounds and that is Liam Neeson, it is not surprising that it has caught people's attention. The visual direction is very good because the movie ends up being very entertaining, this is thanks to the well executed sequences of action, the performances are also very acceptable, but of course those of Neeson and Janssen, are the most outstanding. Another positive aspect of the film is that it can be said that he takes his time in the sense that there is no meaningless action in the first 5 minutes, although the film is not much he dedicates a little time to his characters, and That is very good, you know who is who and why things, you find out why their situation is like this, among other things, I liked it so much that it does not rush things so much, let's be honest that is worth recognizing from a movie of action. I think it is interesting the way in which the film briefly shows how white trafficking is, I am not saying that its representation is 100% realistic, but I dare to say that if it is a bit similar to reality, the film It teaches you that the majority of customers of that kind of thing are not lazy in the street, if they are not rich and often famous people. (Maybe that is one of the reasons why the film did not got good well reviews) Previously I said that the action scenes are well executed, but I did not say that they were very well executed, I mean that it can be said that to some extent the fight sequences are somewhat simple, an example of a very well executed sequence of action would be in ""John Wick"" the way Keanu Reeves moves is incredible, you know he gave himself to the role, because I train Kung Fu literally, and thanks to that you believe it when he defeats everyone, while with Liam you see him ""Fight"" and you say ""well it's just a movie"". Speaking of the bad for more positive aspects that it has is not saved from the negative aspects, although the film is well narrated, many things are very convenient, for example, that of the subject that says ""Good luck"", that coincidentally he runs into it again by chance and casually says ""Good Luck"" and despite the fact that people's voices change a little when they speak on the phone or microphone, Liam's character ""Brian"" manages to recognize him because surely the scriptwriters they thought most would say ""That´s awesome"". Instead of surprising you, the scene only ends up being convenient for the plot to progress, but since after that they reward you with an entertaining action scene. But well the rest is more convenience and Liam proving unrealistically that nobody could against him. In spite of all the good, it weighs on the bad. In conclusion ""Taken"" is a very entertaining action movie, which explores in an acceptable way the subject of trafficking in white, with good sequences of action, an acceptable direction, acceptable performances, a good narration, with various plot conveniences, and things unrealistic, but in spite of that I dare to say that it is a classic for modern action cinema."

I remember going into the theater thinking: ""eh, it probably won't be anything special, just another kidnap and rescue movie."" I was so happy to be proven wrong, this is the movie that raised the bar for kidnapping-and-rescuing films. It's one of the fastest 90 minutes of your life. When you watch it, make sure you watch the unrated and uncut version. Nothing wrong with the PG-13 version, but it's a little too choppy and cuts out all the good stuff. The uncut version is far superior! This is one of those movies with perfect utilization of the entire cast, especially from Liam Neeson himself. He has morphed himself into one of the best action stars of this generation thanks to this movie. Film studios should try this experiment too, take actors who are known for doing drama films and try them out as action stars! Maybe we'll get another good movie like ""Taken""? Or, another new action franchise in general. The possibilities are endless! Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars.

Bryan Mills' daughter is kidnapped by a sex trafficking ring in France which provokes Bryan to find and rescue her.<br/><br/>Taken is absolutely an engrossing thrill ride. The movie has great action scenes especially at the PG-13 rating the movie was assigned. The movie moves at an incredibly quick pace for its 90 minute running time. The movie has the hyper-competent Bryan Mills solve many mysteries off of a few clues that are given to him. This can make for an interesting watch as so much of the movie has Bryan's thought process presented on the screen. This makes for interesting scenes as Bryan pieces things together from clues and observations.<br/><br/>In addition to watching thrilling investigations, the movie features exciting action scenes and chases. The action scenes are not anything new in the genre. However, Liam Neeson's performance and screen presence help elevate the movie this way.<br/><br/>The movie features loads of action scenes. These action scenes have a unique flavor to each of them in either setting or execution.<br/><br/>The movie does have decent acting but it is mostly bland. Liam Neeson is the exception here as he becomes a capable action movie star, None of the other actors stand out. This is more of a flaw on the writing and direction for focusing so much of it on Bryan Mills. The other actors do not have too much to work with from the script.<br/><br/>The writing can feel basic and the direction bland at times. This is an action movie and not one that prioritizes depth in its writing. The action is executed well and it really does show in the box office results. This is a movie that is a nice surprise in the year of release.

How can one man kill so many people and cause so much carnage in Paris and get away with it but hey, it's a movie so why not. The action sequences are great, and it's cool having an older hero. My only real complaint is his daughter. Maggie Grace who is an adult plays her character as if she is a 12 year old, riding a pony and running like a demented schoolgirl. It's so wrong. You actually want her to be taken and returned in a body bag by the end. I always struggle also as to why his three special ops buddies don't actuslly help him either. He could have done with some back up surely. Neeson makes this movie and it totally reinvented his career, spawning many more classic action movies so I can't help but feel affection for this film."

However, the action fighting scene and car chases aren't quite as crisp as ""Bourne,"" nor the stakes quite as high as in ""Die Hard."" The storyline and the idea of what happens to Liam Neeson's character's daughter has some potent impact, his character has some creative mental stunts, and the chain of events mostly articulate and reasonable. Even Liam Neeson's escape from the bad guys wasn't quite believable, losing the climatic impact. The beginning relational issues seemed fairly generic and stereotypical and an overly expansive explanation was provided by the boys night in.

","John McClane on steroids, isn't he? I've never seen any of the 'Taken' films until this one the other day, but I'm usually late to the party for most of these action flicks. I don't pretend in the least to think anything I saw in the film even remotely resembles something that could actually happen, so best thing is to leave your thinking cap behind and enjoy the ride. The one scene I really thought was credibly done was when Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is speaking to his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) while she's hiding under the bed in the Paris residence. He tells her that she's going to be taken captive, bam!, just like that. No sugar coated 'Everything will be alright' because he knew it wouldn't be. It's about there though that all credibility ends, as Mills takes off on a whirlwind chase to hunt down the thugs who kidnapped his daughter.<br/><br/>The thing that really gets me following any of these types of films is how no one even bothers to worry about the aftermath of all the mayhem. Car wrecks, hotel rooms smashed, dead bodies all over the place. For a guy like Mills, (and John McClane), it's all in a day's work once the objective is achieved. And yet, for any of these films that lead to a successful franchise, the same bad luck befalls the action hero in a mind numbing disregard for the laws of probability. Ah well, sometimes it can be fun to get ""Taken""."

Initially, I thought the action was a bad move, but apart from towards the end when it gets a bit silly, is almost Bourne-esque and Bondian in style and quality. Simple acting and a simple story carried out in a gritty way by Neeson continue the excellence, and apart from the very happy ending, is a great film all round."
"RagingDraugr","6","1","1","18 September 2018"," A supremely entertaining Action Thriller, with moments of cleverness sprinkled throughout - but falters a bit due to its mounting issues.
","James Bond may be synonymous with badass-spy-hero-man, but Liam Neeson's ""Brian Mills"", while not having as 'cool' a name, still knows how to duke out with the best. At least, in Movie-land.<br/><br/>'Taken' is a surprisingly entertaining action movie that managed to actually unsettle me with some of its themes - namely, forced prostitution - and intrigue me with the way it sets up Neeson's character; the way it doles out his essence with his extreme cautiousness and protectiveness of his daughter, Kim, and his other ""particular skills"" that are showcased thoroughly throughout the film.<br/><br/>Because of this, Neeson's character was one of 'Taken''s best features. Demonstrating what he's capable of, but leaving enough of him in the shadows to keep you questioning who exactly he is (or was...). After all, the closest we get in terms of knowing what Neeson did before he ""retired"" was that he was a 'preventer'. This mystery allows us to fill in the gaps of his character ourselves and imagine how he knows what he knows (Although, his knowledge of torture techniques, which he uses on ""Marko"", gives us hints at his dark past).<br/><br/>Some of the film's other qualities are its action and occasionally, its cinematography. The action was fun, very much so in fact, and it wasn't just Neeson shooting dudes. There was a lot of variation which held my interest; whether it be examining a crime scene, outwitting French agents - switching cars and using a walkie-talkie to speak into a phone to talk to 'Jean Claude', his old French friend and colleague. <br/><br/>Speaking of Jean Claude, though, the movie made me laugh out loud at one point - where he's walking home with a baguette in his hands. A baguette. Just in case we somehow didn't realise he was French.<br/><br/>But I digress. <br/><br/>The cinematography is...OK, and as I said above, its occasionally good with one or two really nice shots sprinkled in here and there.<br/><br/>I also appreciated the fact that the film didn't need to show captions on-screen to let us know where we were. Many, many films are guilty of this, but this film manages to accomplish this entirely through Cinematic language and not on-screen text - which is commendable.<br/><br/>But if it weren't for Neeson's character, some dark themes and moments, its action, some decent shots and its use of the language of film...this film would be painfully generic with many major plot holes.<br/><br/>Some of these plot plots include, ""Why would Neeson's daughter leave that map with where she was going in an open pocket of her suitcase, if she didn't want her father to know they were traveling around Europe?...Did the documents that Neeson signed that gave permission for Kim to travel to Paris say where she was traveling, or was the location not specified? Otherwise, why would he sign it? Surely he'd pore over that document before even thinking of giving permission...How come Kim's friend, Amanda, is shown dead in that one scene and presumably, Neeson doesn't at least try to recover the body? And she's just forgotten about by the end of the film?...After knocking out Jean Claude, a former French Intelligence agent, how the hell does Neeson manage to get home again without being arrested at the airport for attacking a former French Intelligence agent? Or because Jean Claude was apparently corrupt, did the 'good' French cops excuse Neeson's multiple homicides because he exposed a major sex trafficking ring?""<br/><br/>Not to mention the score is unimpressive and the 'shakycam' could get really bad at times.<br/><br/>So yeah, the plot holes and the other issues mentioned above really limit this film being very highly-rated, but for what it's worth, 'Taken' is still a fun Action Thriller with interesting moments and glimmers of cleverness here and there."

I'm only 32 and I NEVER speak English when I leave the country. Never in my life, because the minute they know you Are American, you are prey.

"Floated2","8","1","1","15 October 2017"," Delivers on Action and Suspense
","Taken has been widely considered a great cinematic action film experience as it combines action and suspense and overall thrills from start to finish. Having seen the sequels before the original, one can agree that the original does live up to the hype and is massively more concise and arguably the best film of the franchise. Liam Neeson plays his role as one should and is convincing in the role, as well as the supporting cast of the daughter played by Maggie Grace and his ex-wife played by Famke Janssen. Another great thing about Taken is the length of the film, as we have seen many action films drag on with little subplots we do not care for, but with Taken the film isn't too long and every piece of screen time is vital. Overall, Taken delivers on what it should as an intense and thrilling action piece of art.
==
As a rewatch (12/03/18') Taken remains a very filling and thought provoking entertaining ride. Full of twists and turns we can see as to why the original is considered the best in the trilogy."
"safenoe","10","1","1","10 September 2016"," Helicopter parenting to the extreme...loved it!
","Wow, what a visceral feeling this movie provoked. There was a sense of foreboding when Kim Mills and her friend decided to head off to France, and you know her father Bryan (Liam Neeson rebooted big time) would be getting on the next plane to Paris to sort things out and find Kim.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie was violent, but it had a meaning and you knew the bad guys deserved it big time, and Bryan deals it out in spades without any moral reservations. I read that when Liam signed on for this role, he thought it would be a straight to video/DVD release, but he took it on to spend time in Paris and brush up on his mixed martial arts. He does not disappoint, and the box office numbers did not disappoint.<br/><br/>Holly Valance plays a key role in the intro and conclusion, and it's good she's doing well in her career. I don't think Holly is related to the late and great Jack Valance."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","8","1","1","11 May 2016"," A streamlined dose of adrenaline. Too bad they had to make sequels.
","The Taken series has been done to death, memed out to glory and mined for market value a million times over since the first film came out way back in 2008, which has somewhat dimmed the charm of that original vehicle, at least for some of us. Like, how many times can Liam Neeson or his relatives be Taken before even they as characters realize that it couldn't be happening and that they're in a movie? Eventually the material unwittingly spoofs it's origin in its need to repeat itself time and again. That's not to say the first isn't enjoyable on it's own, in fact it's quite the streamlined little dose of adrenaline that essentially coasts on some great pacing, neat choreography and the endlessly watchable Liam Neeson, whose career took a shot of nitrous to the heart after gamely stepping into the well worn shoes of the grizzled action hero. This was him nimbly ducking through the genre boundaries that his career was in up til that point, and the action thing fit him like a glove. The film is at its best when it follows Bryan Mills (Neeson) in action, which thankfully is most of the time. Mills is an ex CIA spook with some tactics that will seriously put a hurtin' on you if you cross him in any way. A gaggle of moronic Bosnian human traffickers come under the receiving end of these tactics when they kidnap his vacationing daughter (Maggie Grace, looking suspiciously like she's a decade older than her character is supposed to be) from Paris and auctioning her off to rich raghead perverts. This propels him into like an hour of non stop energetic ass kicking that is so fun to watch, as he shoots, stabs, sprains and splatters his way through hordes of eastern European cannon fodder, with not a second to spare for even the utterance of a single cheesy one liner. He's assisted via Bluetooth by his three ex agency barbecue buddies (Jon Gries, Leland Orser and David Warshofsky) and has a few encounters with his jaded ex wife (Famke Janssen). And that's about it, but Neeson sells the bare minimum as far as the genre goes with his effortless cool and stony, formidable stature that springs into startlingly spry motion every time he has to dispatch a new troupe of Slavic wise guys. If only they didn't have to desecrate this little piece of lightning in a bottle with two sequels that dampen the momentum with cheap attempts at thrills, I may still feel strongly about this one as I did when it first came out. Hopefully they quit while they're ahead, shirk the slimy dollar signs and let their first outing age in peace."

","Lion Neeson as Operative, who would have thought about that. He really Nailed the Role and its his Performance made this Movie.<br/><br/>However i see here a big missed Chance. A more subtle approach with less Body's and smaller Armys to fight him would haven given it a bit more Realistic touch.<br/><br/>And even there only few short Gunfights they are sadly Hollywood like unrealistic. It would have been better to let him slip away from the Factory instead of pumping his Car full of Bullets and leave all Passengers unharmed (even tough also Rifles where hitting it there badly)<br/><br/>Also instead of legions of Bodys, a more believable Reaction by the other Characters would be less Painful to watch.

"ahegde3149","8","1","1","3 July 2015"," Probably one of the best action-thrillers
","Remove Liam Neeson's mind-blowing performance, this film would have been just another generic action thriller. Neeson completely defines this film and is exceedingly likable as a loving father who becomes a merciless killing machine when his daughter is kidnapped by human- traffickers. This may be typical save the kidnapped girl story, but the way it gives edge-of-seat thrills combined with well-oiled action its becomes highly engaging. The sharp dialogues with Neeson's deep voice add to the package. Who wouldn't like Neeson's ""I will find you and I will kill you"" dialogue? And the action sequence when he finally finds the bad guys is simply mind blowing. Another of my favorite scenes is when he makes his old friend realize that he has been sitting on desk so long that he has forgotten the difference between a loaded and an empty gun. The plot remains intensely focused on the father's pursuit to find his daughter without floating into unnecessary sub-plots. The only relevant and important characters where the father and daughter, and their relation is well established in first 20 minutes giving room for the audience to invest their emotions. The film also portrays the horrors of human-trafficking giving enough reason for rooting Neeson's character to find and kill all those bad guys. With well choreographed action, engaging soundtrack and slick camera work with power-packed Neeson Taken is a ride not to be missed. I have watched it 5 times now and it was exciting each time. I still remember the first time I saw it about 4 years ago and how it totally blew my mind!<br/><br/>RATING: [4/5]"

","Neeson plays an ex-CIA agent who won't stop until he has rescued his daughter who has been kidnapped while on holiday in the City of Lights. <br/><br/>Formulaic (not to mention implausible) but fun; on one hand, it's a throwback to 80s action flicks, while also appearing as an homage or tribute to them. Neeson does well with his antihero character, and looks to be having fun with the role and the action, and in Paris. Great action scenes, as Neeson turns those responsible into Swiss cheese, or in a memorably painful looking scene, electrocuting them. Even when they think they can escape him by jumping off a freeway overpass, the film gives them, and the audience, a memorable twist (splat!)"

So the plot ultimately revolves around Bryans daughter Kim (played by Maggie Grace) going on holiday to France with her friend Ruth and getting kidnapped by an Albanian prostitution ring so in true spy movie fashion Mills has to save his daughter. Although one thing i love about this movie is the fact Mills gives the Kidnappers a chance to give his daughter back it really shows that he's using going on a murderous rampage as a last resort but first off he's all ""give my daughter back i that will be the end of it i will not look for you but don't give her back and i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you"" and then the dudes just like ""good luck"" seriously the best part of the movie. so as you can imagine the rest of the movie is just Bryan doing anything and everything he can to get his daughter back, when i say everything i mean it he'll do anything from just plain shoot you in the face to leave you to die in a homemade electric chair i mean it gets rough. my only gripe with the movie is the ending is soooo anti-climatic but other than that its a great movie which i recommend buying on blu-ray"

It is watchable but a 50 plus year old hero bringing down thugs with a single punch is somewhat doubtful. However, Liam Neeson as a father in this film makes a great screen presence.

"The-Sarkologist","7","1","1","2 January 2015"," Liam Neeson goes psycho looking for his daughter
","I'd heard of this movie but for some reason I had never got around to watching it until recently, even though a friend of mine told me that it is 'full on'. I have even read some commentary on it about how the entire movie is basically Liam Neeson running around killing people. Okay, I'm not sure if he kills everybody that he encounters (he doesn't kill any of the French Police) however he does leave an awful lot of destruction in his wake.<br/><br/>The thing with his character is that he is a former operative that once worked for the government (though we are not given any specific details) who has decided to retire to spend some more time with his family. Unfortunately he was a little too late because his wife had already left him for another man and taken his daughter with her. However they are still in touch, and since he is her biological father he is approached to sign a form to allow her to travel to Europe to follow U2 around.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for the two girls upon arriving in Europe they are kidnapped by some Albanians for use as sex slaves, however since his daughter is a virgin she is worth a lot more so is shuffled off to be auctioned to the highest bidder. However, as is expected, Neeson learns about this pretty quickly (namely when she is in the process of being kidnapped) and travels directly to Paris to attempt to trap these people down, using what ever means necessary (and leaving a trail of bodies behind him).<br/><br/>The interesting thing that I noted about this movie is how it paints the United States as being a haven of safety (despite the fact that they live in Los Angeles) where as the rest of the world is an incredibly dangerous place. Look, I'm sure that stuff like that is going on, but I was a little dubious about whether these crooks would be targeting American girls, especially ones from a wealthy background. I am sure, if such a thing were to happen, the US embassy would be on it immediately. These organisations are more likely to use girls from Eastern European countries, and ones that wouldn't come from a wealthy background. It is also interesting how these guys get the girls addicted to heroin so that they are much more pliable and unaware of their situation.<br/><br/>However, despite the fact that this is an unrealistic scenario, it is still one of those movies that you turn your brain off and watch Liam Neeson go psycho as he storms through the Parisian underworld searching for these guys who had the audacity to kidnap his daughter (and effectively freeing all of the other girls as well, though it is never all that clear what happened to his daughter's friend – though it seems as if she was dead)."
"brchthethird","7","1","1","10 October 2014"," Liam Neeson sells this pedestrian but entertaining action thriller
","TAKEN is a simple action movie about a family man with ""a particular set of skills"" who takes down a sex trafficking ring in order to rescue his daughter after she is kidnapped while on holiday in Paris. While this could have gone straight to the bargain bin, what really sells this movie is Liam Neeson, who brings a everyman quality to his role as Bryan Mills. The production values by Luc Besson and director Pierre Morel are also worth noting, with just enough emotional content to make the story relatable and a kinetic style that keeps things moving along at a good pace. Generally speaking everyone gives a decent performance, but I thought that Maggie Grace was miscast as she doesn't look the part of a 17-year-old girl, and her acting is questionable at best. Story-wise, I did appreciate that the movie took time to establish characters and relationships before heading off into more standard action thriller territory but, that being said, it only taps into the basest of human emotions and tendencies. Only someone devoid of empathy wouldn't understand the sticky situation that the characters are put into. Still, despite the rote nature of the setup it works, and the latter two-thirds of the movie rarely let up. As far as the action is concerned, it is well-shot for the most part. Pierre Morel shoots the close quarters combat up close, but the editing isn't so bad that you can't tell who's fighting who, and the geography and shot compositions are decent. If there's one complaint I have in this area is a nighttime car chase which was perhaps a bit too chaotically shot/edited. Overall, this is a decent time-passer that has enough story and thrills to keep you interested, and the running time is only about 90 minutes so it never overstays it's welcome."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","1","27 September 2014"," Excellent action thriller
","A film that solidified Liam Neeson's action star credentials and launched him into superstardom. Taken hearkens back to the good old days of action movies when action stars were unbeatable badasses, the plots were comfortingly black-n-white yet still gritty and the violence had purpose, style and weight behind it.<br/><br/>Taken's pace is at the same time a source of much criticism as well as one of its greatest strengths. The fact is that the story does contain a lot of happy coincidences that in the hands of a lesser director would have made the film superficial and unbelievable. But because the pacing is so tight and because the film can flow from one breathtaking action scene to other without a pause, you can ignore these serendipities.<br/><br/>And what action scenes those are. They would be interesting being performed by pretty much anybody, but they're given an extra boost by Neeson, who can expertly sell both the anguished father and the retired badass aspects of his character. His background in drama helps him to alleviate this above a mere shoot-em-up.<br/><br/>Taken is one of the best action movies of the 00s and an excellent movie to pick up if you're looking for intense action, deeper characters and all around entertainment."

The plot of this film is pretty simple Liam Neeson is a retired spy and after his daughter is kidnapped by Albanian Sex traders he goes on a one man crusade to find her. Now as I said Liam Neeson is superb in this film with everything he does and he is one of the biggest bad asses ever in film on his one man crusade. One thing that is extremely disappointing is the fact that there are no interesting side characters at all, his daughter isn't interesting, his ex wife isn't interesting, his French colleague isn't interesting but the worst is that there isn't a real villain for Neeson to face and that would have truly added to this film. Yes this film's plot is basic but sometimes basic is good and the way the plot is shot and the way Neeson's performance emphasises it, the plot's simplicity is what makes it great. The script is great with Neeson having that now iconic monologue on the telephone and his whole dialogue is great and makes us feel for his character. The style is unique and I really like it the quick shots make us feel like we are with Neeson and the location of Paris was a really good choice for the film.

","Having your child taken away from you is one of, if not the most, horrific thing that could ever happen to a parent. We would dread to think how we would react were this tragedy ever to befall us. This is the situation Liam Neeson finds himself in, in Taken. Neeson plays an ex spy who begrudgingly allows his 17 year old daughter to travel to France with a friend. His fears are confirmed when he finds out she has been abducted but, rather than let the authorities handle it, Neeson takes matters into his own hands and pursues the captors to deliver his own brand of justice.<br/><br/>You would be forgiven for sneering at the idea of Neeson as an action hero but he excels in the role and is clearly having a lot of fun with it, despite the unsettling subject matter. Playing like a cross between James Bond and Jason Bourne, Neeson's take no prisoners style affords the viewer some immensely satisfying fistfights as he tears through the streets of Paris in search of his daughter. <br/><br/>Were it not for the disturbing subject matter involving human trafficking of underage girls, Taken could be described as a dumb, fun action blockbuster. But with the seedy undercurrent running throughout, it's hard to cheer too loudly, despite the fact that a great number of despicable human beings get their just desserts. The scene in which Neeson hears his daughter being abducted over the phone is incredibly tense and unsettling, but it does set up the viewer for the brutal retribution that follows.<br/><br/>There are some shortcomings, such as the failure to really explore the very real danger of human trafficking, and the end is wrapped up a little too neatly and abruptly. But these are minor quibbles which can be easily forgotten thanks to a great performance from Neeson and excellent fight choreography.<br/><br/>A fast paced action movie which deals with a very serious issue in a rather glib and unfocused manner. Nevertheless, there are some fantastic set pieces and Neeson does a great job of generating sympathy in the viewer. Not bad for a guy who tortures someone by sticking electrified metal shards in their thighs."

It fits snugly into the tradition of Rambo and Die Hard behind it, but it replaces Rambo's wounded loner, and Die Hard's blue collar every-man with a bitter spook struggling with his impending irrelevance. <br/><br/>The only problem is Taken is not as good as any of those movies. Early in the movie you realize that every character is two dimensional, with the possible exception of a corrupt French officer, and the only thing each set piece of action accomplishes is an inexorable march to the rescue of the hero's daughter. As soon as you realize this, that this movie has no point other than showing Liam Neesen rescue his daughter after a bunch of well executed gun fights, the movie losses all dramatic tension.<br/><br/>The worst part?

Then we jump right in!<br/><br/>One of the best aspects of this film is that it takes you through the whole chain of command of sex-trafficking operations: first the 'contact,' a young guy who finds out where the girls live and that they are alone; then the low-level kidnappers; then higher bosses who run the pre- selection and drug up the girls to get them subdued; then higher-level traders who take the best merchandise to satisfy rich men with a lust for virgins; and finally the ultra-rich sheik on a yacht, who represents the top-level predator in this disgusting food chain.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson disposes of all of them swiftly and painfully as the movie proceeds towards the final rescue of his daughter. Some girls don't make it, others are lucky and Neeson needs them for information. This is true for a former French sécurité honcho whose wife, a personal friend, Neeson shoots in the leg to get the truth out of him. Both live when Neeson gets what he wants.<br/><br/>The aggregate is as implausible as all such action flicks, but until the last 15 minutes, Besson et al. keep it fairly realistic. Unfortunately, it finally descends into heroes surviving against machine gun spray fire, implausible jumps from bridges, heroes that should be in police custody at the end but mysteriously end up home without a scratch, and such accoutrements of the action film. These were not actually necessary for the plot, so they are forgivable and I give it 8/10. A fun and fast evening!"

To repay Bryan, the pop star agrees to mentor his daughter Kim in signing. Kim soon wants to travel to Paris with her friend. Bryan in no way wants the girls to and travel alone, but in order to try to be closer with his daughter and not upset her he agrees with his ex wife to let her go. The arrive at the airport and unknowingly make friends with a scout for a kidnapping gang. Kim and her friend are taken and trafficked as sex slaves. Kim was on the phone with her dad as she was taken so the former CIA operative springs right into action and gets to Europe. Bryan begins hunting them down and eventually saves his daughter after she was sold to a wealthy sheikh due to her virgin status.<br/><br/>This plot obviously is very gripping as well as cold and chilling, as it gives a pretty realistic look into the world of sex trafficking in eastern Europe. These young girls have their entire lives in front of them and have it all taken away and are defiled. They are treated worse than dirt, as man after man after man pays a few bucks to have their way with them. And like it is said in the movieif they are not found within 96 hours you will never be able to find them again. They also do not have a secret agent killing everyone that holds them captive and freeing them, because in real life people cannot do that, only in movies does that happen. They is virtually no way of finding these girls in real life once they are taken.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to a mature audience that can handle intense action sequences and some disturbing topics of prostitution. I give this movie an 8 out of 10. A 7 out of 10 for the story, and a 9 out of 10 for the action."

","You crack your eyes open and rub away the crust that formed during your nap when you realize you awakened just in time to feel the wheels of the plane make contact with the runway. In that instant the reality of the situation hits you like a ton of bricks: your teenage self has officially arrived in Paris. This is the first trip you have taken without your parents so you are swarmed with the feeling of invincibility. You manage to navigate through the airport, and attempt to catch a cab to your best friend's brother's apartment. A cute man, at most a few years older than you, offers to share a taxi with you and your friend. What girl would deny that offer? <br/><br/>Kim was no exception to this lack of denial in the 2008 hit movie Taken, starring Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills and Maggie Grace as Kim. In the movie, teenager Kim and her best friend innocently accept a very cute, younger man's offer to share a cab. The three of them hop into a taxi together and head off to the apartment they are going to be staying in. When Kim arrives at the apartment, she calls her former CIA agent father, Bryan Mills, to tell him she landed safely. While she is on the phone, a group of men break into the apartment, and kidnap Kim and her best friend. Bryan is able to hear the entire situation unfold and that is when he begins his hunt to find his daughter. Taken is a movie that tells the story of a father who does everything in his power to find his kidnapped daughter in a foreign country. In the process, Bryan exploits the harsh reality of human trafficking and the prostitution business present in foreign countries. This suspenseful action and drama filled movie will have you gripping the arms of the seat so tightly that you will be left white-knuckled.<br/><br/>One aspect of the movie that stands out is the truth behind the story. Although the story line is not based on a real story, women are actually kidnapped in foreign countries and used for prostitution in brothels. The fact that this actually happens is extremely scary, especially being a girl. The movie was able to actually affect my feelings so this makes me feel that Taken was a fantastic movie. It is a movie that keeps you on your toes up until the very end as you wait in suspense to figure out if Kim will ever be saved. I could never predict how the situation would end, which is a problem that occurs in most movies. For these reasons, I would give Taken a rating of 8 out of 10. In other words, it's a must see!"

","How far will a man really go for his daughter? Taken is an action packed, high suspense, thriller that will keep you at the edge of your seat. This father is willing to cross oceans and destroy anyone in his way in order to say the one person he cares the most about, young Kim. Using pure skill and the ability to think fast and intelligently, Bryan keeps his cool and chases down a boat. Running through the streets keeping his daughter's location close in eye sights jumping in a car to catch up, and then fearlessly jumping off a bridge onto the moving boat to rescue his daughter, Bryan Mills is a true hero. Taken has many outstanding actors and actresses. The main character, father Bryan Mills, is played by the exceptional Liam Neeson. Kim, the daughter, is played by Maggie Grace. Other actors and actresses in the phenomenal movie are Famke Jensson, Jon Gries, Leland Orser, and Davis Warshofsky to name a few. The movie was director by Pierre Morel and came to theater January of 2009. Taken made 144.9 million and is looked at as a success by many. The underlying theme of Taken is human trafficking. Kim's parents are divorced and she wants to travel to Paris with her friend Amanda to follow a band tour. To keep the peace and gain his daughter's love, her biological father, Bryan, reluctantly agrees to let her go on her little adventure. Soon after Kim arrives in Paris she is faced with a traumatic experience and is kidnapped. Bryan was on the phone with her as he listened to his daughter fight and struggle and be taken away by criminal strangers. Bryan made it his mission to find his daughter and kill the men who took her and her friend. The rest of the movie was all about Bryan's journey to find Kim. Many plot twists were reveled and the ugly truth about sex trafficking is reveled. I would definitely recommend this movie. Many scenes and topics are not suitable for young children as it may seem scary and overwhelming at times but it is perfect for a mature audience. Taken is not only an awesome action packed, adventure filled, thriller but it also discusses trafficking as a very serious problem. Yes, this movie is Hollywood and many parts of it are very unrealistic but it still draws awareness to the cause and for that I would give it two thumbs up!"

","""The next part is very important. They're going to take you."" Bryan Mills, a loving father gives this information to his teenage daughter Kim when strangers enter the apartment that she's staying in while being away in Paris. In this moment you can sense Bryan's sense of fear and true love for his daughter as he coaches her about what to do in the next 10 seconds that she has before the attackers come to find her since they already have Kim's friend. <br/><br/>Taken is an action-thriller movie directed by Pierre Morel through the studio of EuropaCorp. Taken stars Liam Neeson, as the biological father Bryan Mills, and Maggie Grace, who stars as Kim, Bryan's daughter. When Kim is kidnapped from a friend's relative's apartment in Paris, Bryan is luckily on the phone. Being a retired CIA agent, Bryan is determined to use every last resource and every last hour, which he is told is only 96, to find Kim. Taken was given a rating of 7.9 out of 10 when it was released in 2008.<br/><br/>Hearing Kim being kidnapped was very difficult for Bryan because now that he's retired and settled, he is trying to build a relationship with his daughter. Although Bryan is having difficulty competing for Kim's attention with her loving and wealthy stepfather, Bryan refuses to back down. Having been a CIA agent and knowing what goes on in the world, when Kim came to Bryan for permission to go to Paris with a friend, it was difficult for him to say yes. Loving his daughter more than anything, he let Kim travel with a few conditions. When Kim was kidnapped, Bryan was determined to do anything to get her back, whether he caused trouble for himself or not.<br/><br/>The Albanian mobsters that we learn take Kim and her friend have a specialty in trafficking women. They have been known specifically for kidnapping women, addicting them to drugs, and turning them into prostitutes. As action oriented as the film is, it was in a smaller part meant to bring attention to the issue of trafficking humans. The film brings awareness to this issue in a subtle way that shows how ""the business"" works and how it is happening all over the world, not necessarily in poor countries.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie. Taken is thrilling and full of action, tension, excitement, and a run of emotions. The twists and turns around every corner keep the viewer on their toes. It makes you want to keep watching to find out how everything turns out in the end."

","Pierre Morel Film "" Taken "" is a 2008 action movie , Starring Liam Nesson as the main character . At the beginning of the movie , Bryan Mills , Liam Nesson , a former CIA refused to let Kim ,his 17 year old daughter, travel to Paris with her friend , Amanda .Lenore ,his Ex-wife , convinced him to let Kim go , if he wanted to gain her love . He then approved to her , and what he didn't know was that she was planning a Europe tour . <br/><br/>At the first scene of the film I felt uninterested by the intro , as for me I think it's the most important part of any film . It also does not highlights more on Amanda's personality , although she was a crucial part of the plot . As Kim and Amanda were kidnapped by groups who uses women for sexual pleasure and slavery , the film started to gain my attention and had me in suspense and eager to find out what will happen next .<br/><br/>What I liked most about the movie was its moral theme , people should risk and go beyond the limits for their beloved one's . It teaches us to always be there for our close people , and help them when they are in danger with whatever it takes from risks or limits we go above from .<br/><br/>A negative point of the movie plot was when Bryan went into the building of the gangs as a French Ambassador , and then he speaks in the English language with them instead of French . Also , Lenore showed no signs of worry to her daughter , and did not insist in traveling with the father to look for her kidnapped child instead of sitting home waiting . <br/><br/>I recommend these to movie goers whom like fast action and incredible fighting scenes with a hint of unrealistic action that will not cease to keep you amazed . Also , I recommend "" Man on Fire "" directed by Tony Scott and "" Speed "" directed by Jan De Bont if you liked this movie"

","Released in the U.S. in January, 2009, ""Taken"" is one kick-axx movie! In fact, it's the best I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>THE PLOT: Liam Neeson plays a retired CIA agent whose 17-year-old daughter is abducted by Albanian sex-slavers while vacationing in Paris. Neeson immediately flies to Paris and utilizes all his skills to find his daughter and mercilessly punish anyone involved in the sex-trade who gets in his way.<br/><br/>""Taken"" plays out like a James Bond flick but without the goofiness and boring parts. Once Neeson gets on the trail of the sex-slavers it's non-stop suspense and action until the end.<br/><br/>What makes the film work so well is that, like Neeson's character in the story, the viewer is left totally outraged by the sex-slaver's abduction of his daughter; hence, you're passionately rooting for him throughout the rest of the flick.<br/><br/>It's true that Neeson is a veritable one-man-army in the film but it's presented in such a way that the viewer is able to suspend disbelief. In other words, it SEEMS believable. More than that, you WANT it to be believable because you want him to get his daughter back and annihilate the scumbags. Besides, Neeson is realistically portrayed as a father ruthlessly driven and pulling no punches. He has the emotional edge and determination that the slavers lack. He's an unstoppable force pure and simple.<br/><br/>The film addresses a scary subject -- the sex-slave trade. This really happens. I know of two beautiful young girls locally who have disappeared while vacationing abroad; one was in Cancun and the other in Africa. The parents and siblings are left devastated and scarred for life. What happened to the girls? No one knows, but the sex-slave trade is a very real possibility. Not to mention the Natalee Holloway case; Urine Van der Sloot confessed in an interview that he sold Natalee for $10,000 and a boat came and picked her up. This would explain why no remains have been found. Although he later retracked the statements the strong possibility remains that Natalee may have been sold into the sex-slave trade.<br/><br/>The moral of ""Taken"" is simple: Anyone involved in the sex-slave trade deserves nothing but instant and merciless obliteration from this plane of existence.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I read Roger Ebert's review before seeing the film and he gave it a mediocre 2.5/4 Star rating. Nothing could be further from the truth. ""Taken"" pulls you in and and takes you on an enthralling thrill ride throughout its runtime. Not to mention it's well made on every level. But let's remember that Ebert gave the overrated and pretentious ""No Country for Old Men"" a perfect 4/4 rating. Unbelievable.<br/><br/>The film was shot on location in France and runs a short-but-sweet hour and a half.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"
"orourkec-292-269155","7","1","1","17 February 2014"," Overall, quite exciting & finely paced
","Like I said in my summary above, overall I found Taken quite exciting and well paced (and well and suitably paced through the entire movie also), even though it is flawed regarding some of the action which lacks enough strength to make Taken TRULY exciting. However, some of the action was fun to watch fortunately. My favorite scene from the film is where Liam Neeson is in his car and drives on the streets at a crazy, absolute full speed after the boat on which his abducted daughter was embarked unto, including the scene, seconds before that where he's seen running after the kidnappers for such a long time (while he was running, he made me think of the terminator running after his prey in terminator 2 Hahahahaha.), before tiring himself out and finding the car I've just been talking about. When I say he made me think of the terminator don't think I'm saying that I didn't like to see him run for so long because of that. I found it heroic to see him run, run and run, and I don't care if he makes me think of the terminator as long as I like to see him running and that it gives me the tension I want. The car scene was the absolute best, because you could feel the tension of the ride there and it was non-stop driving for what looked and/or felt (on scope) like 5 minutes to me when I watched it. Or, at least 5 minutes is the first thing that would come to my mind if I had to say how much (in minutes or seconds time) did the car ride feel and/or looked, because of the long time it took. My favorite quote is ""I will tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to"" because of the dialogue to which it connects to (I'm not telling the dialogue in case of SPOILERS! for those who haven't seen the film) For the family conflict, it is well developed and fun to watch and hear how the characters (father, mother and daughter) each behaves and reacts as a consequence of another's action. And there is also a strong performance from Bryan Mills'ex-wife when she discovers news about her daughter being taken. She performs perfectly and just the way you would expect a mother to behave when her child's been taken. Everyone is well cast. My recommendation to you if you've never seen Taken: Taken is far from being unmissable, but you will nonetheless still find some good thrills to hang around with. At least, you have to! Just, don't expect the action, whenever it comes to involve your brain at a high rate!"

","Taken is an action thriller film which features the recognized action star, Liam Neeson as the father of Maggie Grace his 18 year old daughter who longs to travel to France, encouraged by her mother, Famke Janssen who is remarried to Maggie's stepfather, Xander Berkely. The start of the movie is set in America in 2009, until Kim (Maggie Grace) travels to France, where the remainder of the movie is set. <br/><br/>Brian Mills (Liam Neeson) is a former CIA agent who is struggling to come to terms with his divorce and is trying to keep a good relationship with his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Kim is a teenager and wants to travel to France with a friend from school. Kim's mom Lenore (Famke Janssen) is encouraging this trip along with Kim's wealthy stepfather Stuart (Xander Berkely) contrary to what Brain believes to be best for his daughter. After much convincing, Brian allows this trip to happen and gives Kim a plethora of safety precautions in order to stay safe. However, upon Kim's arrival in France, she and her friend take a taxi with a man who, once he finds out where they are staying, eventually comes back to kidnap them. During the kidnapping, Kim is on the phone to Brain, and he knows exactly how to handle this situation. Kim is brought into the human trafficking industry and Brian must bring back his previous CIA training in order to make it to his daughter before it is too late.<br/><br/>A lot of this movie shows Brian using his special training to get to what he wants, his daughter Kim. The actions scenes keep the audience on their toes. One scene in particular where the filmmaking was crucial was in one of the final scenes where Brian comes face to face with a man who had purchased his daughter. In order to reach this man, Brian had to have many violent fights. The music was suspenseful and the sound effects made it seem extremely realistic. The fast paced camera switch ups between the villains and Brian also kept a high energy. When Brian finally made it to the man who was in control of his daughter, the suspense is extremely high. This energy is maintained by the suspenseful music and the gunshots exchanged in the fight. <br/><br/>Taken was an action film that kept me guessing throughout the entirety of the movie. It was refreshing to see an action movie that stayed true to the plot without being predictable and was also based upon true events. Usually, I try to stay away from stereotypical action movies, but this one definitely captured my interest, kept me guessing and left me wanting more."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","1","14 October 2013"," Taken Works Solely Because Of Liam Neeson's Stellar Performance.
","Marking the dawn of a new era in Liam Neeson's acting career by reinventing his image and establishing him as a capable & charismatic action film star, Taken is a purely generic action thriller that's filled with all the known elements of action filmmaking, and has nothing new to offer but thanks to Neeson's stellar performance, it still makes up for a damn good ride.<br/><br/>The story of Taken follows a retired CIA agent named Bryan Mills who's trying to strengthen his relationship with his estranged daughter who's leaving for Paris with her best friend. But when both of them are kidnapped by human traffickers for sex slavery, Mills is compelled to go after the kidnappers and relies on his old skills to track them down before it's too late.<br/><br/>Co-written by Luc Besson & directed by Pierre Morel, Taken wastes no time in setting up its plot and once it gets going, it doesn't stop until the very end. The direction is slick, script is almost always focused on its lead character, its moments of action definitely benefit from its kinetic camera-work, while its tight editing makes sure that the narrative unfolds at a frenetic pace.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Taken is Liam Neeson's show all the way for the actor returns to form in grand style and delivers a swashbuckling performance which, despite being over- the-top at several instances, resonates a charm of its own for Neeson is believable as both an merciless assassin & a protective father. Other than him however, the supporting cast is dull & don't have much to contribute.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Taken may not feature any moment that any action fanatic hasn't seen before but watching Liam Neeson beat everyone to a pulp is something that turns out to be refreshing & rewarding at the same time. Stylishly crafted, fiercely paced & elevated to new heights by Neeson's impressive input, Taken is an unexpected surprise & an undeniable fun flick that lives up to its cult status. Definitely worth a shot."

","Well, I don't really know what to say about this movie. It was very different, I can say that. I got it on DVD recently and watched it the next day, and enjoyed it very much. I mean, by different, I don't mean it was bad, but it was a little disturbing. I'll start out with the general comments, like I almost always do. Liam Neeson played a believable dad, searching for his daughter, and played the role very well. Interesting fact, he was a dad, he was close to the age of the man he was playing, and that's where he got his motivation for the movie. Famke Janssen did a great job as Lenore, the annoying, pushy, and not very likable mother of Kim Mills (Neeson's daughter). Maggie Grace did an astounding job as Kim Mills, the girl that is abducted. SInce those are the main characters, all I can say is the acting by the rest of the actors is very good, take my word for it. The special effects and action scenes were also very well executed. They were very real looking throughout the movie, and added a high level of intensity to the film, not that it needed it. The whole film was intense and full of action, but I'm talking about the scenes where there are tons of explosions on a high scale. Specific comments, I will say now. This movie is a stark realization of how disgusting the world truly is. Saying that because, this really happens! Some people I know's greatest fear is exactly what happened in the movie. I can say, if this happened to me, I would be deeply scarred for the rest of my life. How about you? Pierre Morel, (is that how you spell it?) did a wonderful job directing this movie, and even better, he doesn't speak any English making an American movie. SKILLS! Anyway, if you are squeamish or easily disturbed, do yourself a favor and not watch this movie. If you aren't and have a liking for great movies, then go ahead and watch it, I recommend it very strongly to you. This was a great movie and will watch it again sometime, and enjoy it again. Thanks for reading and check out some of my other reviews too!"
"eoghanmc-784-82211","8","1","1","5 September 2013"," Taken to a new level
","In Taken Neeson proves himself a true action hero as he fights his way across Europe to save his daughter in this action packed thriller. I must admit I wasn't entirely sure how good the film would be, I'd read a couple reviews but still wasn't sure about Neeson taking (ha, ha) the lead role as an action hero. Let me say now that all uncertainty is now well and truly gone. Taken is a truly excellent action thriller with Neeson giving a great performance in a role I could best describe as James Bond if he was retired with a family. The action never let's up and is pushed forward by a more compelling motive than most films of it's type as a father races to save his daughter, stopping at nothing to get her back. With certainty I can say that Taken was a pleasant surprise and a most definite hit for me, a hearty recommendation for a more unique action thriller then I have seen in a good while."
"view_and_review","7","1","1","30 June 2013"," It's no ""Man on Fire"" but it's good
","I gave this movie a 7 rating based upon Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) and his die hard tactics alone. At the beginning of this flick I was ready to pull the plug and call it a bust, but I'm glad I hung in there. Still, the only compelling part of this movie was Bryan Mills' tenacity, resourcefulness and ability to kick a**. The movie started very slow and uninteresting. I'm well aware that movies need some character build up time, but I found that I didn't like the characters. When a spoiled girl, with the help of her mother, lies to trick her father into letting her go to Paris with another equally young and naive girl only to be kidnapped... we tend to say: you make your bed you lie in it. You reap what you sow is also applicable. In other words, all that was going through my head was, ""far less deserving girls have gotten kidnapped and I'm supposed to care about you?"" So, to start, I wasn't all that sympathetic nor was I moved to fully root for Bryan Mills to buck all odds.<br/><br/>My attitude soon changed. It didn't change because I saw the purity and innocence of his daughter, it changed once I began to see the sheer creepery (or should I say creepness?) of the characters involved in the kidnapping. Then, and only then, did I want to see faces smashed, pain inflicted and overall destruction. I don't think it was Liam Neeson's acting so much as it was the script that depicted Bryan Mills utter desperation and at-all-costs willingness to get his daughter back.<br/><br/>This movie was a cross between Hostel and Man on Fire and it was still able to have a unique enough flare to separate it from those two. A vigilante film done well is always good in my book"
"Hey_Sweden","7","1","1","15 June 2013"," The lesson for today is don't mess with Liam Neeson.
","The film star is all kinds of bad ass in this grim, intense action flick, which could be described as a very lean and very mean James Bond type of film. It's so briskly paced and action packed that it clocks in at a very trim 91 minutes (and it only runs an extra two minutes in the unrated extended cut). If it does its job, you won't be thinking about how implausible any of it might be - you'll just be wolfing down the popcorn and having a high old time.<br/><br/>Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a retired CIA operative who's left the business to make up for lost time with his now teen aged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). She gets an opportunity to travel to Europe, and the protective, cautious dad is dubious about the whole thing, especially upon learning of the lack of parental figures on this trip. Of course, he's proved right as the hapless girl is abducted by Albanian human traffickers. He gets his ass to Paris and leaves a trail of death and destruction in his wake as he does everything he has to do to save his girl.<br/><br/>As long as one is looking for some undemanding no-brainer violent fun, they can quite enjoy ""Taken"". It definitely doesn't waste its time once its gets going. It is a little slow to start as it establishes Bryan trying to be a cool dad and making a living performing such duties as security for a pop star (Holly Valance). But when Bryan gets moving, the movie turns into a wild ride, with plentiful scummy bad guys who can't die soon enough. It's also amusing to note how ruthless Bryan can be. The man doesn't care who he has to shoot in order to get what he wants. Some viewers may find the activities of the bad guys to be quite off putting, especially considering the fact that they place a high value on virgins. Editing, location work, and photography are all well done, and a good supporting cast including some familiar faces (Leland Orser, Jon Gries, Xander Berkeley, and the lovely as ever Famke Janssen as Bryans' ex- wife) all help to make this agreeable escapism.<br/><br/>As far as this kind of entertainment goes, one could certainly do a lot worse.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."
"spicelady67","7","1","1","3 April 2013"," good story of family, change and action in Paris
","I watched Taken on a library DVD after watching Taken2 earlier. Taken sets more of the scene of the retired CIA agent trying to stay near his 17-yr old daughter while being the ex-husband and much poorer than the step-father. He has his daughter's best interests at heart. As other reviewers have noted, watch the story unfold and don't think about the props and action scenes. Iaam is great and always finds the weapons, technology, and people just in time. The location and action scenes are lovely as well as dark. His buddies are helpful and funny. The rescue scenes are physically brutal as well as the shooting particularly in the French agent's house."
"edebrajjean","7","1","1","26 October 2010"," My Belief Is Suspended By Lack Of Character Development
","I viewed this film on the recommendation of a friend who kept getting Liam Neeson's name mixed up with actor Leslie Nielsen of The Naked Gun series and other movie spoofs. Needless to say, Taken left me shaken. A great action film using a subject as serious as sex trafficking for entertainment value grabbed me from the beginning, but didn't set well in its grossness and vilification of Arabs, Albanians and the French as the single-minded prostitute trader/murder caricatures they portrayed. Nor, for that matter, did the writers' motivations of actor Liam Neeson as a one-man Mission: Impossible wrecking crew forced to save his daughter alone after she and her friend are targeted at the airport by a marker and later dragged from their rental home after being set up to the end of being dehumanized and marketed as prostitutes.<br/><br/>Of the 1966 TV show Mission: Impossible, Martin Landau played the character of Rollin Hand and was married in real life to Barbara Bain—-best female undercover Central Intelligence Agent/Federal Bureau of Investigation-or-whatever agent/spy in television who played the character of Cinnamon Carter. What would it have looked like had Landau's character of Rollin not married Cinnamon of his same knowledge, life experience and common interest but Peggy Bundy of Married: With Children and with the bubble-head that Peggy was having taken no interest in his work nor him teaching her any skills by which to save herself before or after their marriage; neither did Rollin make an effort to rouse her interest and teach her anything of himself and his work? Thus, after some time of them giving birth to Kelly, Peggy, then deciding she can't take any more of Rollin's long work absences away from them both, files for divorce and later nabs J.R. Ewing of Dallas for new trophy husband and rich stepfather for Kelly and then learns nothing of his work either except how to spend all his money!<br/><br/>And so sets the plot for Taken with empty-headed Mama Lenore (Famke Janssen) wanting to give her seventeen-year-old daughter Kim played by Maggie Grace the chance of a lifetime—travel to Paris with girlfriend and equal minor Amanda—if she can get ex-husband and CIA retiree Bryan (Neeson) that she dated and married yet never knew nor trusted and is still hardened against to give Kim, as equally empty-headed as her mother, consent. And to that end, Bryan doesn't like the idea from the get-go, as with his ex-wife, in all seventeen years of Kim's life he has taught her no intelligence whatsoever--NOTHING of his expertise of self-defense and how to read people and warns: ""No—I know the world!"" But in his assigned role of carrying the plot as a one-man vigilante good-guy, Bryan consents. Yet at the airport, he learns Kim and Mama have lied to him—the whole trip concerned Kim and Amanda's plan of tracking a U2 concert tour throughout Europe with some nineteen-year-old cousins—only later does gullible Kim realize distrusting Dad was right on learning trusted friend Amanda had lied to her—the cousins they were supposed have hooked up with were in Spain and they had the house to themselves! Before Kim can tell Dad--whose promised call to him on her safe arrival she had not made--that Amanda had lied to her and they were in Paris alone, Bryan's worst fear is realized as Kim tells him from the bathroom that Amanda's being grabbed by two men and carried out screaming. With the traffickers coming for her also, Bryan instructs her over the phone to yell out what they're wearing, color of hair, their smells, body defects and the like as leads for him to follow as he tapes the call, with it ending in her giving him NONE. Yet as he then has to give his ex-wife the bad news Kim's been kidnapped by sex slave traders, to add meat to Bryan's role, rich second husband Stuart--who had just outdone his birthday gift to Kim of a Karaoke machine by giving her a Thoroughbred--is so equally a one-dimensional still drawing that he had no money and no one out of all his family and worldly business connections to call on in proper J.R.-speak and pay to infiltrate Paris behind Bryan in support of his Mission: Impossible of saving his stepdaughter COLLECTIVELY? <br/><br/>And in the process of escaping through fires, flipped cars, boats and every scrape with barely a scratch while killing every villain pursuing him with barely a gunshot wound, Bryan succeeds in saving Kim single-handedly--and with no lead given him from her—and empty-headed Lenore that had never fit him is so happy to have her daughter back safe and sound that she doesn't even ask the ex-husband she never knew nor respected how he found their daughter; and neither, for that matter, does 'bubble-head' Kim!"

","""Taken"" revolves around a retired spy whose daughter is kidnapped by a human trafficking ring in Paris. Naturally, he hops the first plane to Paris in order to dole out some serious ass-kicking.<br/><br/>The plot may be pretty contrived but that sort of deficiency probably won't make much difference to the kind of viewer that this film is aimed at. As a revenge flick promising an abundance of action the film delivers on that promise, though seasoned viewers have probably seen this sort of thing countless times already.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is pretty good here and handles the role better than I would have expected. There's not really anything awards-worthy in his performance but that's mainly due to being limited by the material. Other than Neeson, only Famke Janssen really stands out.<br/><br/>Pierre Morel's direction is in the current action flick mold and is solid as far as that goes. Gratuitous cutting doesn't detract from the flick, except in the case of one chase scene. The score is decent enough but unremarkable.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, ""Taken"" is the sort of action movie that does its job well but takes no chances. The film's high rating (7.9 at the time of this writing) suggests that there might be more to it but that isn't the case as far as I'm concerned. Nevertheless, I'm sure that action fans will eat it up."

OK you should see it, it is packed with action, both car chases, fighting, shoot-outs and the underdog winning in the end. Just don't expect to be challenged on the story line.

","Taken: 6 out of 10: Taken comes this close to being great. It had an admittedly rocky start with Liam Neeson is trying to reconnect with his virginal 17 year-old teenage daughter in a way that seems just on this side of creepy. (Dude get your own girlfriend... really) Speaking of which; swarthy bad guys, who clearly have never heard of Nancy Grace, are kidnapping Rich American Girls and making them drugged out street walkers or selling them for millions to Arab Sheiks based on whether they are virgins or not? So ex-CIA estranged father Liam Neeson has 96 hours to find his daughter before she is “gone forever” deflowered and then burkaized apparently. “A Fate Worse than Death” you can almost hear the characters thinking.<br/><br/>It’s as if Charles Bronson was guest starring in an Ilsa the Wicked Warden film located in George C Scott’s Hardcore and the entire enterprise was PG-13. And yet the film still works two thirds through. Liam Neeson is more than fine. He is kicking ass on all cylinders. It’s the bad guys that drop the ball.<br/><br/>First a rich French guy starts quoting the Godfather. “It’s not personal it’s business” For starters the quote isn’t even in context. He might as well have told the gun toting Liam Neeson “may the force be with you” for all the sense it makes. Second of all you can’t quote the Godfather without referencing the fact that you are quoting it in the first place. Any screenwriter who does that should be sleeping with the fishes.<br/><br/>The second slap to the head is an Arab Sheik character that looked like he stepped out of a 1940’s Bugs Bunny cartoon. Honestly I don’t know where to begin on this silly stereotype. Why is he the film? Why does he have a knife to the white virgin’s throat? Who would Oscar Schindler shoot???? The last point seems important since the Arab is basically a Juden in a dress. Same large noses, same aversion to pork, same living in ghettos in Europe (Or/and having all the money), same secret organizations paying off French politicians, same affinity to despoiling white Aryan virgins... The more things change the more the stay the same I guess. (They didn’t have the Arab cook and eat a baby. I guess they are holding that back for the sequel) Overt French xenophobia aside, Taken is a fun ride for most of the trip. (The dinner with his French policeman friend and Frenchman's wife was a particular highlight) And as I did mention Liam Neeson kicks ass."

","Taken contains very little plot, gets kind of ridiculous at times and is quite predictable. It's also a fun, fast-paced revenge movie with lots of good kinetic action sequences and unfolds at a brisk pace. Taken rarely drags and is never really boring. It's an exhilarating non-stop roller coaster ride of a movie that never lets up.<br/><br/>Taken has a European sensibility like other Luc Besson produced films have had in the past. It's basically a well shot glorified B-film that is skillfully directed.

","Very few action movies have a very strong emotional motive for the protagonist. The protagonist of ""Taken"" has a very strong emotional motive. He is after all trying to save his kidnapped daughter from a sex trafficking gang. The bad guys in ""Taken"" are lets say - pretty bad. They evoke no sympathy and it is a treat to see them smashed to pulp. Every blow, every bullet, every kick is slick, fast and if I can say so - extremely enjoyable. In Taken, it is fun to see someone really take on the bad guys and hand it to them in their own coin.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty predictable. Bryan's(Liam Nesson) daughter is kidnapped by an Albanian sex trafficking gang in Paris. Bryan, a former CIA agent, goes on a no holds barred rescue mission to save his daughter. All hell breaks loose- that is -for the bad guys. The body count is pretty high - my guess is that it is more than 50. No prizes for predicting the finale - the bad guys pay dearly - real bad, I must say. <br/><br/>The plot is not the highlight of the movie. The acting is good. Liam Nesson does a good job. This is often exactly the kind of role tailor made for Harrison Ford, but Liam Nesson does a neat job here. I am not a big fan of flash editing but it seems to work well in this movie. The action scenes like I said before are really good even though they are pretty violent. <br/><br/>I would give a movie like this a 6 out of 10 but I am inclined to give this movie a 8 just for sheer edge of seat engrossing action."

Endless scenes of violence and gun-play in which the hero is never hurt even against incredible odds but all his opponents get wasted. (Eastern Europeans can't shoot straight, etc.). Lots of peek-a-boo scenes of young women being prostituted in the most vile fashion. (Not, of course, that any are not vile.) This movie has it all, and used it all to play to the worst in anyone.

"Kakarot_XR","10","5","12","10 November 2008"," Seriously. Top 100 movies for IMDb so easily.
","Just finished watching this superb film literally ten minutes ago.<br/><br/>Taken is probably this years most under-rated film. Easily. For a person whom enjoyed The Dark Knight, Wanted (although after watching it for the second time I realised how stupid it actually was), Hellboy 2 and Cloverfield.<br/><br/>All movies which I thoroughly enjoyed and would say are probably in my top 100 fave of all time.<br/><br/>I had put off watching Taken for a while purely because I hated Maggie Grace from LOST. But you'll be glad to know her role although it is a 'main role' it isn't really huge in appearances. She's there at the start and she's there at the end. Personally overall, I think she was actually a good actress in the film! Portrayed a young innocent girl quite well, hell - even lied really well! Taken is basically about an ex Marine/Mercanery (Liam Neeson) whom unreluctantly lets his 17 year old girl (Maggie Grace) and her friend who go to Paris. Upon arriving to Paris they are kidnapped by Women Trafficers whom kidnap women, get them addicted to drugs and either make them prostitutes or sell them on to others. The 17 year old girl makes a quick phone call to her father (Liam Neeson) screaming that she is being kidnapped. The father gets a flight into Paris to get her back. Using his Mercanery experience he goes deep into the underworld of Paris to look for clues and information to his daughters whereabouts.<br/><br/>But what makes Taken so much better than Wanted and etc? It's realistic and it shows the world a real problem the world is facing. It isn't about a secret agent who goes against his government/country to get revenge for a girl he knew for like ten minutes. It isn't about a slack job office boy who becomes a lethal bullet bending assassin in twenty minutes. It is a simple, realistic movie that honestly takes you down into the shallowest darkest places of Paris and shows you just how harsh the real world is. It doesn't sugar coat it, it doesn't 'Americanize' it (By Americanize I mean dumb it down, go over the top or make it unbelievable) - it simply shows the viewer just how lethal and scary the underworld can be.<br/><br/>Anyone who enjoys a good action movie, something with a compelling story will LOVE this film. It doesn't have any stupid over the top action scenes, Liam Neeson doesn't have any outrageous gadgets. He doesn't have super powers. He's simply a father wants to find his daughter and to find her he is willing to do anything in the world.<br/><br/>Watch this movie. You will love it. Trust me.<br/><br/>10/10."

","I saw the trailer for this movie and really thought it would be great. It was pretty good, but fell into a few movie cliché's and suffered from poor acting from most everyone but Neelson. This was especially true from all the scenes in Paris.<br/><br/>The acting and occasional plot hole aside, this was a good action flick. Several reviews have pointed to the Bourne movies, and it does have that spy character who is ready for any situation. Unfortunately this movie doesn't get nearly as deep or even pretend to build characters. Instead, this movie focuses on a father who just happens to, as the trailer notes, have a particular skill set that enables him to track down and deal with people.<br/><br/>There is some exposure to sex trafficking, but that only goes as deep as it needs to find his daughter. I recommend this movie, just don't pay $12.00 to see it. Check out a matinée or rent it."

But soon finds out that she's been kidnapped.<br/><br/>Starring Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen and Holly Valance, the movie is directed by Pierre More and is written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen.<br/><br/>Besides being a good action / thriller, this also deals with what has been on the increase over the last few years and that is women trafficking through Europe with organised gangs and also shows the internal sides of this with the use of drugs and how women are sold into prostitution. Off course there are other methods that the organised gangs have been known to use but this just shows how easy it is for them to trap women into this. This is what Pierre More has really highlighted extremely well and even goes on to show that this can happen in the most romantic city in the world, Paris. It makes one think that about these women, working they way they do, what many consider to be the oldest profession in the world, what is their original back ground and how they have managed to reach in cities such as the red light districts of Amsterdam and other major cities as well as being sold to wealthy individuals.<br/><br/>There are some very good action sequences and some are breath taking as well, not to mention that use of sophisticated gadgets may make one remember a bit of James Bond.<br/><br/>Filmed in France, this does contain topic of sexual and drugs related nature as well as violence in relation to that and many may find some scenes rather distressing. Therefore watch out for parental advice, or, the certificate rating. But never the less, this is a movie that does contain good action and is worth watching."

","In an age where mainstream action heroes could do with a little one-on- one time with a psychiatrist, this hugely successful French-American crossover brings back the ethics of a Seagal or Stallone - break an arm in three places first, ask questions later. Whereas now I can look back at the 1980's action genre with a semi guilt-ridden smirk and amuse myself at the questionable politics, Taken takes itself very seriously, trying to disguise it's straight-to-DVD credentials as something cleaner, more 'topical'. The topic is people trafficking, but there are too many stubbly, tattooed foreign bad guys to torture and kill for it to become anything profound. He just wants his daughter back.<br/><br/>Forced into retirement from the CIA to be closer to his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) earns his money from security jobs with his fellow retirees. His ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) is now shacked up with her millionaire husband, and announces that Kim wants to travel to Paris with her fellow 17 year old friend. Mills, having seen the evil in the world due to his job, opposes the trip, but eventually agrees under some strict guidelines. Naturally, upon arrival, Kim and her friend are kidnapped while Kim is on the phone to her father, who takes various clues from the phone call to aid him on his quest to get her back.<br/><br/>This was my second viewing of Taken, as I felt like I needed to watch it again after being perplexed by the almost universal praise this received from audiences. I was amazed the first time around at the sheer audacity of the film's racial stereotypes, and the shake-the-camera-a-lot approach to the action scenes. The second time, I enjoyed it a lot more - but as a comedy. There is simply too many plot-holes and general laziness for it to be taken remotely seriously, and the now infamous phone call scene spouting some classic lines. When talking to the kidnapper - ""if you're looking for a ransom, I can tell you I don't have any money. But what I do have are a particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career."" It's almost too bad to comprehend.<br/><br/>What confused me most is the message behind this movie, as it seems that Mills' overprotective, almost racist (in context of his views of any countries outside of America) father is proved to be correct when Kim gets kidnapped by some sleazy French people. Yes, yes I know this was made by French people, but even they are portrayed in a stereotypical manner, with Mills' police contact, um, Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin), looking like he's stepped straight out of a Jean-Luc Godard movie and is looking for his baguette, beret and necklace of onions. Then there's the sleazy Albanians, smoking cigarettes in string vests, and the sleazy Middle-Easterners, including a grossly fat sheikh who looks like he's wandered off the set of The Thief of Bagdad. Of course the Americans aren't sleazy, just spoilt and bullying.<br/><br/>How this is so highly-praised is beyond me, as every aspect of the film is awful. I could understand people warming to it's cheddar-caked charm and quotable script (""this is not the time for d**k-measuring!""), but other reviews I've read on IMDb take this film seriously, as if it was some kind of stepping-stone in action cinema. Well it's not, it's a steaming pile of unoriginal turd, returning to an oh-so-simple tale of revenge set in the modern-world of continental tension and American interference. A minor plus-point is Neeson, who gets through this surprisingly unscathed, given the bilge he has to work with, and manages to re-invent himself as an action star (he went on to star in The Grey and Taken 2 - both 2012). But I think I've finally understood the moral of this story, and it's one I can agree with - don't go to France.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

While Natasha is on the phone with her father, they get kidnapped from their apartment. Igor, knowing that time is of the essence, does not call the local police (who would trust the NYPD while he is only 10000 miles away) and decides to fly over for a visit.<br/><br/>Igor breaks into the apartment. He knows that the Mexican Mafia is involved and kills a man at the airport and so the killing begins.<br/><br/>To give it the right atmosphere, Igor speaks only Russian, as he knows that all Americans speak fluently Russian, especially the Mexican Mafia members.<br/><br/>Igor meets his old friend John, who used to work in CIA and is now a NYPD head officer, who tells him he can't help him, but gives him a business card. Using this business card Igor pretends to be a special NYPD officer while he speaks only Russian. The Mexican Mafia members believe Igor and he successfully infiltrates their established HQ and kills everyone in his way. The NYPD does not care much for murder and violence Igor leaves behind, as this is widely accepted in New York.<br/><br/>He deliberately cripples his friend, an innocent mother of children, by shooting her with a gun, because she was married to John.<br/><br/>He kills the big boss, rescues his daughter and leaves the country via JFK Airport, cause the Mafia, NYPD, CIA and Customs administration are absolutely useless. When he comes home, his ex wife gets his ""I was right message"" and everyone in Russia is happy.<br/><br/>So what do you think of the script? How plausible is it? Well, to give a connection to the film Taken, try to substitute: Natasha=Kim, Igor=Bryan, NY=Paris, Russian=English, Mexican=Albanian, KGB=CIA etc.<br/><br/>Maybe if the film wouldn't try to be so serious but had been more like From Paris with love or Pulp Fiction the script would be much more appropriate."

","I watched ""Taken"" last night and, even though nearly 20 hours have passed since then, my blood is still pumping to my heart at a vastly increased speed! That's how exciting and adrenalin-rushing this brand new and brilliant French/American co-production is. Courtesy of the extremely gifted writers Luc Besson (""Leon"", ""The Fifth Element"") and Robert Mark Kramen (""The Transporter"", ""The Karate Kid""), this is easily the most spectacular and non-stop exhilarating movie of the past five years or so; even surpassing the high quality and intensity level of the Bourne trilogy, the newest Die Hard sequel and all movies starring Jason Statham. The concept of ""Taken"" covers the derivative formula of a rudimentary kidnapping movie, but what truly matters here is the unceasing fast-paced violence and the testosterone-packed performance of Liam Neeson. He stars as a retired spy for the US government who desperately tries to get in touch again with his estranged and heavily spoiled teenage daughter. When the girl and a friend travel to Paris against Bryan's will, they promptly become abducted by an Albanian network of drugs and network. Bryan has only 96 hours to save his girl, but barely a clue where or how to start his investigation. Luckily enough, Bryan is a trained fighting specialist with connections all over the world. ""Taken"" is somewhat similar to Roman Polanski's late 80's thriller ""Frantic"" story and setting-wise, but the speed and stunts are typically Luc Besson. Obviously this isn't the most plausible movie ever made, but I don't even think you're even supposed to believe half of what you see, just sit back and enjoy the ride. ""Taken"" is a smörgåsbord of virulent car chases, fist-fights, martial arts, explosions, sweet torturing methods and ultra-revolting bad guys. Fantastic stuff."

","On thing that is a sure as the sun coming up tomorrow is that a film written by Luc Besson will be thrilling. There's Taxi 1-4, Transporter 1-3, Leon, the Professional, and many more. This is just another one of Besson's magical films that will thrill you from start to finish.<br/><br/>Darkman himself, Liam Neeson, is magnificent as a father that will do anything for his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). When she is taken for the sex trade, he springs into action that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end.<br/><br/>I have seen some very good films about the sex trade. Mira Sorvino in Human Trafficking, and Kevin Kline in Trade; but, Neeson is at the top of the game in tracking though the muck of this business to get to the top. We see all levels of the business on the way, and we glimpse the dregs of humanity in the process.<br/><br/>Realistic car chases, plenty of scum left on the floor, and some very satisfying justice makes this the most incredible 93 minutes you can experience."

He manages to make the roll more believable and human which gives more of a sense of what a parent/special agent will do for their kid who's life's in danger and the paybacks also catches you buy surprise when your expecting a little mercy towards the BG's. Neeson pulls off the fight scene's with ease and comes across as one super bad ass which isn't hard to imagine if you have scene Batman Begins, Michael Collins or Rob Roy.

"MacAindrais","Null","3","6","15 October 2008"," Pimps & Assassins: Do the Math
","Taken (2008) **<br/><br/>Is it better to evaluate a movie on what's good about it? Or is it better to judge a movie on what's bad about it? If 2/3s of a movie are competently entertaining, but another third shockingly dreadful does the good still outweigh the bad? That's the issue with the new Luc Besson/Pierre Morrel Liam Neeson starring vehicle Taken.<br/><br/>Neeson plays Bryan, a former spy/assassin of the government sort. He's retired, now living in California to be close to his daughter, who lives with her mother and step father in a lavish mansion. She wants to go to France with a friend, and she needs her father's permission. He's hesitant but lets her go, only to find out she's actually following U2 around adding to his nervousness. Of course he's right to be nervous, as she is kidnapped immediately after settling into the city. This occurs while he's on the phone with her, which conveniently has been recorded so that his ex-assassin buddies can analyze the call, pinpoint that the kidnappers speak Albanian, with an accent they can apparently narrow down to one village, and then determine that the man speaking into the phone is named Marco. With this information he travels to Paris to search out his daughter employing his mad skills.<br/><br/>While there he pieces together one by one who is behind it, finds them, finds where the girl has gone, kills a lot of people and then, well I won't spoil it but I'm sure you know where this is going. The plot line in the picture is very, very standard. Allow me to quote film critic Jules Brenner in his review of Taken: Just calling this formulaic doesn't cover it. The script should be credited to the computer software template that originated it."" Now that is a gem of a soundbyte. It's also pretty much bang on. Besson never really takes any time to seriously look at a very serious subject. It's just a conduit through which he can insert standard action movie happenings. Just because a movie is made in Europe doesn't mean it's any less prone to Hollywood clichés.<br/><br/>In describing the movie, I'm realizing more than I did when I started writing how mediocre the actual story is in the film. But, for 2/3s of the movie you can kind of forget about that most of the time. Fact is, the action sequences are quite well done, and director Morrel realizes that the key to keeping the audience from realizing just how predictable and substandard his story really is, is to never give them a chance to think about it. The film moves at breakneck speed, and when the hunt is really on its quite entertaining.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson goes from totally unbelievable to mildly believable by the end of the movie. He gives a good performance, but sometimes he's a bit of a distraction. Question: Is he American or British here? Sometime he doesn't seem to speak with an accent, others he clearly does. All his ex assassin friends are American (save for a French guy in France), he lives in the US and his American wife refers to him sacrificing for the good of the country. Anyway, that's irrelevant.<br/><br/>So that's what's good about Taken. Now, the bad. Well we've established that the plot originated from a standard action movie template. It's got the usual foreign baddies and fat cat Arab's lusting for Western virgins. And for an underground human smuggling operation, it's surprisingly easy to find. Oh, and of course, the bad guys all have terrible aim while the good guy's is dead on - but that's so old hat in any movie with a gun fight I probably just wasted 20 seconds typing this out. <br/><br/>So this is all forgivable given the success of the nonstop action in denying us the opportunity to reflect on the plot. What's not forgivable is just how shockingly awful the first half hour of Taken is. How bad is it? I don't even know if I can describe it. Things really go down hill when a bunch of cheery, wildly unbelievable former assassins show up at Neeson's door.... with beer, and chips and hotdogs for a BBQ. They chat nonchalantly about jobs in Beirut and so on and so forth. The effect can only be described as unintentionally hilarious, or perhaps the most unbelievably miscalculated plot point since Micky Rooney played an Asian in Breakfast at Tiffani's.<br/><br/>Then there is the daughter and her friend. I don't know if they're bad actors or just entirely at the mercy of the worst written characters I've ever seen in a film with such prestige. For that matter, I assume Besson must have wrote in French then translated to English. Lost in translation is the only conception I have to explain such awful lines (""They're there, I can hear them!""). Its no word of a lie that I almost walked out after the opening third confused as to whether give Taken half a star for sheer ineptitude or 5 for being the funniest comedy I'd seen in ages.<br/><br/>But, I stuck it out. I guess I'm glad I did. In the end, yes I was entertained. Then I had the opening conundrum. I was really almost ready to give Taken a mild pass. But now that I've come to the end of the review, I've been given the time to reflect. And Taken is still dogmatically formulaic. Maybe if you don't think about it afterward you'll be satisfied. Unfortunately for me, I thought about it."
"cinemaniac_x","1","5","13","28 December 2010"," Predictable, unoriginal, and unbearable
","""I told you so"" would be an understatement for Liam Neeson's character, ex-CIA ­operative Bryan Mills, in the film Taken.<br/><br/>Mills retires from his job to spend more time with his 17-year-old daughter, Kim, who now lives with her mother and wealthy stepfather. Kim plans to travel to Paris and seeks her father's permission, but he is worried about her safety. Kim's disappointment and the anger of his ex-wife convince Mills to change his mind.<br/><br/>However, almost as soon as Kim arrives in Paris, she is ­kidnapped. Now Mills is faced with his worst fear, losing his daughter. He uses the skills he learned from his job to track down her captors.<br/><br/>Taken does not have much of a storyline (and what little plot it has is clichéd and predictable). Nor does the film ­feature original, developed characters; the audience is forced to put up with the seemingly ­superhuman Mills, his spiteful ex-wife, the naive, spoiled Kim, and the inept ""bad guys."" Consequently, Taken relies on action and some suspense to engage its ­viewers. Perhaps the best scene of the movie is Kim's kidnapping, in which the element of suspense is ­executed very well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the strengths of the film are negated by the ending, which I can only describe as terrible. There is a complete change in mood, and there is no transition for the change to make sense. The ­finale also leaves many loose ends and seems to question the audience's intelligence with the amount of liberties it takes.<br/><br/>Bottom line, expect a mildly entertaining action flick with one-dimensional characters, a dull script, and a predictable plot."

","Saw this last night and am amazed at the good reviews. You know when a plot is so implausible, the plot holes so glaring, that you're literally yelling 'BULLSH*T!' at the screen? I was doing that every thirty seconds.<br/><br/>First, this film is constructed completely from clichés. Ex secret agent tough guy (Liam Neeson) whose soft spot is his daughter? Check. Brittle ex wife who has left him for a generic rich guy? Check. Slutty blonde friend who leads angelic daughter astray? Check. Immigrant baddies running implausible white-slavery prostitution ring? Check. Double- crossing Frenchman with world's thickest french accent? Check. Arab baddies on a yacht? Check. If you're guessing that the father pulls through, the daughter ends up safe and still nauseatingly shallow, the baddies end up dead and the slutty blonde friend dies, yup, that's about it.<br/><br/>Still, it could have been good. Day 1 of 24 covers similar territory and is great. But it's not, it's terrible.<br/><br/>The whole set up of the abduction doesn't really make sense at all. Yes, sex trafficking exists, yes, it might be for prostitution, yes, there might even be Albanian mobsters in Paris involved in it. But why the hell would they abduct clearly rich, American girls for prostitution? American girls with family who will miss them and enough clout to make a fuss about it? More trouble than it's worth, easier to traffic Eastern Europeans. They go to all of the trouble to abduct these American girls and promptly kill off slutty blonde with an OD of drugs -yeah right, they'd be more careful with their investment. The French authorities turn a blind eye to missing Americans known to be abducted, again, I don't think so. <br/><br/>Given that the whole thing ends with a white slave auction where annoying daughter sells for $500,000 it would have made a lot more sense for Liam Neeson to just get rich step-dad to cough up that much, or even double that, offer them the money for ransom and save everyone a lot of trouble. <br/><br/>The action is trying to be Bourne-like in its roughness, but it's not good enough to pull it off. It's not clever. It's not believable because it's all a straight line, Neeson gets one clue from a guy, shoots him, and that clue always pans out, leads him to the next guy, who gives him one clue, then he shoots him, next clue pans out, etc. There are no surprises and no particularly good fights. This is not a great action movie. It's a bad action movie and an absolutely dire movie if you consider it as a whole.<br/><br/>Two stars purely for Neeson, who does the best he can with the two-dimensional characterisation."

It amazes me that this movie is so popular (7.9 rating on IMDb). I kept looking at my watch waiting for it to end. I'm giving it three stars just to be generous because the girl who played the daughter did a good job.<br/><br/>This could've been better with it's source material, but come on.

"bluetone-1","3","4","10","17 July 2009"," Ludicrous
","An absurd premise from the get-go - that travel to Europe is horrendously dangerous for pretty young American girls due to the unstoppable tactics of rampant white slavers. And we're specifically told that the eastern Euro. bad guys have switched from securing their ""product"" by luring pretty residents of the former Soviet bloc to jobs that don't exist, instead looking to ""slash transportation expenses"" by just grabbing girls as they arrive at Heathrow airport.<br/><br/>Natalie Holloway, anyone? What happens when just one pretty, American girl disappears during foreign travel? We're supposed to believe the hue and cry from press around the world wouldn't offset the cost of a car trip from Moldova? I didn't buy Liam Neeson as the girl's father for an instant, and exposition is rarely as clumsy as is seen in ""Taken,"" with Neeson's former colleagues showing up to grill some beef and replay the good old days in Beirut, battling those stuffed shirts ""back at Langley."" <br/><br/>The conveniences amass quickly, from the rich step-dad who can conveniently fly Neeson to the scene, and from there with Neeson never taking a step that doesn't lead him directly to exactly the bad guys responsible for his supposed daughter's disappearance, and even to the very same locations she'd traveled through just hours before.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you see a car chase taking place anywhere in the proximity of a bulldozer, its shovel blade menacingly close as the vehicles whip nearby, just what do YOU suppose will eventually happen to one of the bad guys. Fortunately, when he cleverly plants a bug on one of those bad guys, seconds later the guy is talking to his henchman about the missing girl's location. When Neeson character gets home, he should by a Powerball lottery ticket, because his good luck never falters! The ""action"" kicks off with Neeson confronting a mysterious knife-wielding attacker pursuing an internationally known singing star. <br/><br/>What a lucky thing for the attacker that a security slip-up allowed adoring crowds to flood backstage post-concert, and that fleeing them happened to take the mega-star running past the very spot where the dangerous man waited with his glinting knife blade. Neeson's handling of this situation is the final piece to the puzzle that tells us he's every bit as sharp as he was back when he led an elite CIA team.<br/><br/>The film is competently, sometimes even prettily shot. But the story stretched the bounds of credibility far beyond reason. It does not ask for a suspension of belief - it requires dim-witted stupidity. And while Neeson appears up to - and perhaps even relishes the action aspects of a Bruce Willis role: vindictive, no-holds-barred CIA killer/Dad, the script's efforts to set him up as such is amateurish in the extreme. <br/><br/>Finally, as alluded to earlier, while the first 15 minutes show us Neeson gazing with a smile at family photos of his daughter, nothing in his performance with the young lady herself (other than the TV-caliber dialogue) leads us to suspect they've even met before. Yeah, she hugs him a lot and says, ""Oh, Daddy!"" But I never bought it."

We are told all this needlessly in the early sections even though one promising sequence sums up everything spectacularly. Mobile phones have been on big-budgeted movies radar for many years now and when such household commodities prove a nuisance, screenplays go to extreme lengths to anul their presence. In Pierre Morel's ""Taken"" the mobile phone takes centre stage. Without them the movie would suck.

The same writers (Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen) used the same formula for the ""Transporter"" films.<br/><br/>For aficionados of the genre, ""Taken"" will probably be reasonably enjoyable -- although the hand-to-hand combat leaves something to be desired, bodies fly backwards through the air when shot in a completely satisfying manner.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson manages to make a one-dimensional character almost two-dimensional -- well, make that one-and-a-half.

Then put all that in a very dangerous setting, let's say Paris for instance, cause we all know that after Bagdad it's the unsafest city in the world.<br/><br/>And then you have the infamous Albanian mafia, that doesn't know a better way to make money then to kidnap girls from developed western countries and turn them into prostitutes. I sincerely doubt those guys ever had ideas like that, they smuggle heroin and weapons which is much more profitable for them. Now I could be convinced some Romanian, gypsy or Albanian girl was sold to work as a prostitute, but even then it was more likely it was done by her relatives or someone she knew, and its highly doubtful they would kidnap girls from elite Paris neighborhoods in the middle of a day.<br/><br/>Also it's very interesting how they hook the girls they kidnap on heroin in a matter of hours, and that all the girls in the brothel look like zombies on crack. Who would go to such a brothel, when you have such great brothels all around Europe? Obviously the makers of the movie haven't been in any of the European brothels, which I must say is a shame, cause they would've had some fun and would have not wasted enormous amount of money to make such a bad movie. Next time go to Germany, Switzerland, Netherland... and visit some nice FKK it will save you the trouble, and us the pain.<br/><br/>What's even more funny is that his daughter's friend, who was not a virgin, got overdosed(totally counterproductive from the Albanian mafia)in the first 48 hours she was kidnapped, and even if she didn't die she would have been destined for a career of a low life prostitute in the hands of the mafia, while Neesom's daughter which was a virgin, would have been sold for half a million euros or dollars, whatever. No one would pay that kind of money for a kidnapped teen just to deflower her, for god sakes Ribery payed something like 2k for a 16 year old, and she made a career after wards. No, but in this movie they have an auction for this girl, and buyers came from all around the world like she is a nuclear missile, it's just so sad.<br/><br/>Now there is numerous number of other script flaws in this movie, like when Neeson pretends that he is a French policeman without speaking a word of French, Or when he saves some girl from a brothel and puts her on infusion, which he happens to carry around with him to clean her from drugs cause he is a hobbyist doctor, not to mention that in the end they just let him fly out of a country after he killed a few dozen men and shot a French policeman's wife.<br/><br/>Now what bothers me most about this movie is not the inconsistencies it's the main actor Liam Neeson. I saw his name, and have seen very good grades here on IMDb and based on that I decided to watch this movie. What a mistake. Note to myself, don't just watch the scores read a few reviews next time.<br/><br/>Neeson is obviously a crafty actor and makes scenes look realistic, which only adds to my annoyance with this film. I used to think he was at least a decent actor, and now I can't help wondering why did he shoot such a bad movie? I would think that a guy of his reputation and age could choose a role and a movie he wants to play in. I dunno maybe the money was to good, but he certainly didn't need to make this movie.<br/><br/>He is a mature actor, that could be playing serious character roles, instead he chooses to play super-spy father figure medicine man ronin. I just can't understand that, shame on him. Btw sorry for any mistakes English is not my native language, oh and I am also not French, Albanian, Iraqi or anything else that you might think had influence on this review."
"Thomasamills","4","3","7","3 June 2011"," Not The Hard Hitting Action Thriller I Was Hoping For
","The trailer for Taken had me gripped. I thought to myself, this is what I'm talking about. A gritty revenge thriller staring to impressive Liam Neeson. When watching the trailer, I was being reminded of the last two Bourne films, which I loved. Although I didn't see it at the cinema I was always wanting to watch it and when I did, I felt very let down.<br/><br/>The main problem is that the trailer showed a basic outline for the film. A father who has a history with the special forces tries to find his kidnapped daughter in Europe. I was wondering when the film started what twists would occur and how intense the action would be. Well, the trailer gave me the film. There is no extension on the story other then Liam Neeson goes to Paris and kills everyone who gets in his way of getting his daughter back. That was it. The best moments of action were wasted by too much use of the hand held camera, meaning most the time I struggled to see what was going on. Neeson's character is very boring and the film is completely dependent on the action.<br/><br/>The film does have entertaining moments, but nothing special enough for me to recommend it. Most of my friends who like the film have praised it's awareness of the sex trade industry in Europe. But it doesn't, it just uses that as an excuse for the film to become more darker, but nothing else. For me personally, the best revenge thriller to be released in the past few years is Man on Fire. The film was brilliantly directed and had characters we genuinely felt for. This film really does fall short of the mark when comparing it to Man on Fire.<br/><br/>There are entertaining set pieces and it is good to see Liam Neeson getting his hands dirty, but it takes more then that to make a good thriller. I understand that I am in a minority with Taken having it been given a 7.9 vote on it's IMDb page, but I feel let down by the film and that this type of film has been made before and been much better."
"ernesto66","4","3","7","24 February 2011"," Miserable...
","Liam Neeson has made so many movies in which he's miserable you would certainly think he'd have the expression down by now. And throughout ""Taken,"" even before the action starts, he proves it like never before. From the first frame his face is screwed into a look of discomfort you haven't seen since John Boehner's last interview.<br/><br/>There's nothing to say about plot here - or character development, logic, or anything else new to the genre. The movie is as generic and bare-bones as possible: hero, victim, bad guys, death. It moves, and that's good in an action movie, but to say it moves is like saying Glenn Beck cries. Of course it moves. It's supposed to.<br/><br/>The better question is whether it's different from anything else you've seen in the last ten years. That is, since digital manipulation of editing, special effects, stunts and now apparently screen writing has become so prevalent. The answer in my opinion is no.<br/><br/>It's exactly the same, with the popular new twist added that the hero is completely invincible. He feels no pain, has no emotions, never gets injured, is prepared for everything and can get out of any outlandish situation. So not only is ""Taken"" generic (and sexist, and xenophobic), it's also dull and very predictable.<br/><br/>Which might explain Mr. Neeson's more incredibly pained on screen expression. Could he be picturing his foreseeable future in movies? Not as the brooding leading man of intelligent, well-written pictures, but as Jason Statham's new daddy."

","French director, and French writer (Luc Besson)...and this ???? Take it as an adrenaline action-packed movie and it's great. But the background story is offensive to say the least. Whatever happened to that famous French/European subtlety ? This movie manages to vilify Albanians,Arabs and French and make heroes out of CIA operatives and the US in a way I thought only Rambo could. They probably wanted a action movie with a background moral message, and they succeeded and while doing so, managed to make a caricature out of a very complicated issue (prostitution trafficking in Europe). On top of that, to vilify Arabs from an American point of view NOW, when the US has 2 dubious wars in 2 Arab countries ? I gave 5 points for the childish enjoyment of seeing a good action revenge movie, and took 5 points for a shameless use of serious issues. Hollywood, please grow up."

"tom-ratcliffe","4","3","7","10 August 2009"," Action packed and unsettling, but not in a good way
","I watched this film with a group of friends having noticed it on the shelf for a while at the store. The packet proudly boasting ""extended harder cut"" and other such stuff about revenge, brutality etc.<br/><br/>It wasn't what initially attracted me to the film, more that I was interested to see what that would mean with Liam Neeson in the lead roll and a reputation to think off - as opposed to films such as ""Hostel"" where the actors are less well known. It turns out that the accuracy of the taglines was about all this film had going for it.<br/><br/>The basic plot (SPOILERS FROM NOW) is that Neeson is some kind of retired covert agent who loved his country more than his family, leading his wife to leave him and take their daughter too, though they've managed to keep a relationship despite his wifes efforts. Daughter tells Neeson one day she wants to go to France with her friend for a week alone, he's massively against it but is eventually worn down, and allows her to go - and then would you adam and eve it, no sooner have the daughter and her friend gotten to France and put their bags down, when some masked men break in and kidnap the pair of them! Typical!<br/><br/>Fortunately she was on the phone to daddy at the time, and he soon whisks over to France to track them down and save the day, using brutal violence and an incredible ability to dodge bullets.<br/><br/>Now as a dumb action movie I could sit through that plot quite happily, but the first issue comes with the reason for the kidnapping, the girls are being taken into sex slavery. To me this is a real and disturbing topic that should only feature when there is something real and relevant to be said about the situation, yet in Taken it is used purely for shock scenes along the unpleasant lines of films such as ""Hostel"", and the route through this topic to it's resolution becomes so absurd I found it insulting to the reality which god knows how many women have to suffer through. It seemed very bad taste. Following that the other issues for me are more down to bad plot/acting etc.<br/><br/>Neeson - his character is the LUCKIEST super spy! The suspension of disbelief required to accept what he is capable off is ridiculous. Dodging bullets at point blank, tracking down all those involved from a voice on the phone and sitting in an airport, always picking the right door/person/clue. Again, when you have a man running round like the Terminator it cheapens the reality of the situation his daughter and her friend are in.<br/><br/>His family - Neesons wife is the uber bitch, his daughter is a 17 year old perfect, innocent virgin - she still loves horses and wants to be a singer when she grows up, she even still calls Neesons character daddy... and she run's like she got hit by a car (see the airport scene). The roles are played well enough but the characterisation is so clichéd it's painful.<br/><br/>The police - all useless, and if not useless - in on it. Apparently kidnap is such a regular occurrence in Paris they don't even bother investigating it any more. Good thing there's an American coming over to sort filthy old Europe out!<br/><br/>The gangsters - idiots. The most painful scene being when they believe Neeson (who's character lets not forget is an American agent) to be the french chief of police purely because he turns up at their door in a long coat with a business card... still with an American accent, and promptly begins to discuss rates for their operation. You would have thought these criminals would know what the chief of police would look like, especially when they tell Neeson they met him just last week to arrange the police's cut!<br/><br/>There's also the obligatory product placement of phones, cars and other electricals, but perhaps the biggest joke of this film is who they expect you to believe Neesons daughter is the number one fan of... Holly Valance. Yep. Holly Valance. Perhaps the most tortuous scenes of all being Neeson speaking to his daughter over the phone in Hollys presence - ""You'll never guess who I'm with, yes really, I'm in the room with her now - I know, it's incredible!""<br/><br/>So that's basically it. Were it not for the sex trafficking topic, this film could be just a dumb, clichéd action movie. But to treat such a subject so crassly and with nothing really to be said left a very bad taste in the mouth, and at the end left me feeling very uncomfortable, as if I'd been a part of something seedy.<br/><br/>This film was certainly not of the calibre I would expect of a respected actor such as Liam Neeson, and having watched it I am surprised he agreed to the role. I am also surprised by how highly this film is rated, my guess being those ratings based on the action elements - which are fast paced, exciting and intense - but for me could not make up for the negatives.<br/><br/>***If you have seen this film you may also agree that there is no amount of times Neesons character should be able to turn to his wife and scream ""I told you so!!!"" That could be a 20 minute DVD extra on it's own!"
"herbsierra","4","3","7","12 May 2009"," sigh ...
","OK, OK, i know it's an action flick, an American james bond as it were, and as long as that is all you're expecting it works ... somewhat. from my perspective it was disappointing because there was no depth in the plot. nothing was unexpected, moreover it was predictable. i don't especially like happy endings and i was so hopeful this film would take a bad turn at the end and it COULD HAVE had a really sinister twist - i wanted the girl's stepfather to have ultimately been identified as a major cog in the human trafficking thing - but alas, it did not, making my disappointment a reality. another quick thing, the ""plot"" was so transparent in how it played to American political interests and fear mongering vis-a-vis mideast politics, making the sheik the bad guy and neeson the American hero was so weak ... i'm tired of all that kind of pandering in films."
"vince-316","4","3","7","26 March 2009"," Quite shallow and unbelievable
","Any time I am about to see a film these days I check first on IMDb. It's pretty much guaranteed that a film with over a 7 rating will be a well made film and anything 8 or above will most likely be a corker. Liam Neeson is also a favorite actor of mine so I was really looking forward to seeing ""Taken"". But in this case I think it's way off the mark. The film struck me as shallow and totally unbelievable. I got the idea that whoever made the film had seen the Bourne Trilogy and was just looking for another reason to send a covert CIA trained psycho-assassin-with-a-heart on a stylish killing spree. The personal side of the characters is so unbelievable that I found I started questioning the rest of the file. For instance, how could a man who could happily kill so many so coldly in one scene be such a soppy hug machine in the next? It's not even the kind of thing you stop to consider in Bourne. In summary, I'd say watch Bourne and give this one a miss."
"kyliem11","4","3","7","25 March 2009"," Unrealistic at best
","Neeson's performance is the only thing that saved this movie from an even lower score. It is so far fetched that it is a joke. Neesons daughter takes a trip to Europe, and despite being warned by her Dad is kidnapped within hours of landing. Enter Neeson to save the day, armed with nothing more than a gun and a phone, he travels to Europe, locates the criminals and saves his daughter, all within a couple of days. Taking on a large, violent crime organisation single handedly he shoots everyone and everything in site. The so called criminals have obviously never had anything to shoot at, because in hundreds of attempts, some at an open target and at close range, not one manages to hit the target. Neeson, on the other hand is an expert, never misses and kills them all! This could have been so much better, but is so over the top it is ridiculous. If all you want from a movie is lots of action, then you may enjoy this, but if you want something more avoid it like the plague."

Even though some scenes only last a few seconds, it must have been a lot of work to get this on picture in such a perfect way.<br/><br/>Neeson does not fight the villains, he literally steamrolls over them with remorseless determination. <br/><br/>Aside from that it is loaded with little details in the script pushing this movies ahead of almost any competition...<br/><br/>movies like this will not cross your eyes often, so go check it out."
"Darren-Aronofsky","4","3","7","13 February 2009"," bad movie
","If CIA agents in general were as skilled as Bryan Mills in particular, Osama bin Laden would have been an American prisoner since late September 2001. ""Taken"" shows Mills as a one-man rescue squad, a master of every skill, a laser-eyed, sharpshooting, pursuit-driving, pocket-picking, impersonating, knife-fighting, torturing, karate-fighting killing machine who can cleverly turn over a petrol tank with one pass in his car and strategically ignite it with another.<br/><br/>We meet Mills (Liam Neeson) in ""sort of retirement"" in Los Angeles, grilling steaks with old CIA buddies and yearning to spend more time with his 17-year-old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). Kim now lives with her mom, Mills' ex-wife (Famke Janssen), and her effortlessly mega-rich husband (Xander Berkeley), whose idea of a birthday present is giving Kim not a pony, but what looks like a thoroughbred.<br/><br/>Mills has seen action in Afghanistan and apparently everywhere else, and knows it's a dangerous world for a naive teenage girl. He is against Kim spending the summer in Paris with her girlfriend, even though ""cousins"" will apparently chaperone. He's right. Kim and her pal succeed in getting themselves kidnapped the afternoon of the same day they get off the plane, although Kim has time for one terrified phone call to Dad before she's taken away.<br/><br/>Now listen to this. Using CIA contacts at Langley, Mills is able to use his garbled tape of their conversation to determine the name of his girl's kidnapper (Marko), that he is Albanian, that his ring kidnaps young tourists, drugs them and runs them as prostitutes; the virgins are auctioned off to Arab sheiks and so on. Headquarters also tells Mills he has 96 hours to rescue his daughter before she meets a fate worse than death, followed by death.<br/><br/>With this kind of intelligence, the CIA could be using bin Laden's Visa card in every ATM in Virginia. It's the set-up for a completely unbelievable action picture where Mills is given the opportunity to use one element of CIA spycraft after another, read his enemies' minds, eavesdrop on their telephones, spy on their meetings and, when necessary, defeat roomfuls of them in armed combat. At one point, a former colleague in the Paris police says he has left seven bodies behind. He's just getting warmed up. How this man and his daughter could hope to leave France on a commercial flight doesn't speak highly of the French police -- and the new ""Pink Panther"" doesn't open for a week. Oh, why does he have only 96 hours? To provide the movie with a handy deadline, that's why.<br/><br/>It's always a puzzle to review a movie like this. On the one hand, it's preposterous. But who expects a ""Bourne""-type city-wrecking operative to be plausible? On the other hand, it's very well-made. Liam Neeson brings the character a hard-edged, mercilessly focused anger, and director Pierre Morel hurtles through action sequences at a breathless velocity. If Kim is an empty-headed twit, well, she's offscreen most of the time, and the villains are walking showcases for testosterone gone bad. The only tiny glitch is that if one chase scene doesn't use the same ramp down to a construction site that the opening of ""Quantum of Solace"" did, it sure looks like it does.<br/><br/>""Taken"" reopens a question I've had. A lot of movies involve secret clubs or covens of rich white men who meet for the purposes of despoiling innocent women in despicable perversity. The men are usually dressed in elegant formalwear, smoke cigars and have champagne poured for them by discreet servants. Do such clubs actually exist? Since every member would be blackmailable, how could they survive? If you lost everything in a Ponzi scheme, would you betray your lodge members? Just wondering.<br/><br/>The movie proves two things. (1) Liam Neeson can bring undeserved credibility to most roles just by playing them, and (2) Luc Besson, the co-writer, whose actioner-assembly line produced this film, turns out high-quality trash, and sometimes much better (""The Fifth Element,"" ""Taxi,"" ""The Transporter,"" ""La Femme Nikita,"" even ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada""). The bottom line is, if you can't wait for the next ""Bourne"" thriller, well, you don't have to. I can easily wait, but Truth in Reviewing compels me to confess that if the movie I was describing in the first paragraph sounded as if you'd like this, you probably will."

When his daughter goes to France things take a turn for the worst as she ends up kidnapped. This is bad news for the guys who took her since Neeson was once an agent over seas and he doesn't play nice.<br/><br/>Pure popcorn movie is a bit slow to start but once Neeson's daughter goes missing the film begins firing on all cylinders and its becomes really clear that Neeson has a future playing bad ass action heroes. Its a violent take no prisoners ride as Neeson single mindedly goes after his daughter and no one who gets in his way is safe. No one. This means its mean and nasty with a torture scene that well, I didn't know Liam had it in him. I really liked this film a great deal. It just winds it self up and goes like a rocket.

That would be acceptable if the rest would be good enough to support his role or the movie at all. The rest of the cast is often to cliché or over-dramatizing. The movie is taped on cheap video and sometimes it looks like a TV movie or like filmed on my cellphone. The cuts are often to fast or even misplaced to give the feeling of fast action. The music, oh boy oh boy. I can't believe i spent money for this cheap crap. I don't like comparing movies, but this one reminds me somehow of Chronenbergs'""eastern promises"", which is a great movie with a similar topic. Why do some directors not watch and learn?

The guy is a bit reluctant because he's seen too much darkness on this planet during his days of work for the agency, but he signs anyway and thus the story starts rolling.<br/><br/>And roll it does. Taking a few plot holes at a time it finds its way to the bottom of the rabbit hole pretty quickly and as things get more and more dirty the plot holes get deeper.<br/><br/>The film isn't entirely bad, but if they had listened to the call of reality a bit more often it would have been a lot better. Now it is just another film where some invincible angry human chases after a lot of bad guys and that really doesn't credit it as well as it might have been.<br/><br/>Another irritation factor to this film is its short running length.

","I knew this was a kidnap film, and from the clips I saw it looked like a rather aggressive and violent film, and I heard about how it became a surprise smash hit at the cinemas, so I had to see why so many loved it so much. Basically Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a former CIA operative who retired to be closer to his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), who lives with her mother Lenore (GoldenEye's Famke Janssen) and wealthy stepfather Stuart (Terminator 2: Judgement Day's Xander Berkeley) in California. At Kim's seventeenth birthday party Bryan buys her a karaoke machine, because of her passion for singing, but he gets upstaged when Stuart buys her a horse, coincidentally he saves threatened pop star Sheerah (Holly Valance), grateful she agrees to tutor his aspiring daughter. Later his daughter asks his permission to go on a trip to Paris with her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy), he is very protective but agrees as long as she takes an international working cell phone and calls him every day, but they are actually following the band U2 during their European tour. Arriving in Paris the girls meet friendly young French man Peter (Nicolas Giraud) who offers them a cab ride and to a party, in fact he is gathering information about them. Kim does what Bryan told her to in calling him, but she gets a shock while talking as she watches Amanda being taken by intruders, so on the phone her dad instructs her what to do, hide in the next room under the bed, knowing she will be kidnapped he also tells her to shout physical descriptions of the intruders, which she does. Bryan tells Lenore and Stuart about Kim's kidnapping, and meeting his former colleague Sam (Leland Orser) he determines the men are Albanian sex traffickers who abduct female tourists, it is highly likely she will disappear and not be heard from again within 96 hours. Bryan travels to Paris, he finds the young man Peter there, but he chases him when trying to interrogate him, and before he can catch and ask him any questions he is hit by an oncoming truck, so hoping to find some clues he meets up with former French field agent Jean-Claude Pitrel (Olivier Rabourdin), who is slightly unhelpful, but does direct him to an East European gang who prostitute women. He finds a makeshift brothel, and there is a girl wearing Kim's jacket, so he fights off the guards and escapes with this girl, and when she awakens she gives him a little information he can follow about the house she met his daughter in, and there he confronts the thugs pretending to be from the government sent to renew a ""contract"". These thugs are tricked by Bryan into saying certain things, and he recognises the voice of Marko from Tropojë (Arben Bajraktaraj) as the man on the phone, so he wounds him and kills the other men, and restraining him he looks around the building at other kidnapped girls, letting them free, and he finds Amanda who is dead from some sort of overdose. Making a makeshift electrocution chair he tortures Marko to give him information about where his daughter is, and he tells that Kim is valuable as a virgin on the black market, and was sold to auctioneer Patrice St. Clair (Gérard Watkins), and before he leaves he leaves the chair to electrocute the thug to death. Bryan tells what he knows to Jean-Claude, but deduces he is corrupt, and he shoots Jean-Claude's wife Isabelle (Camille Japy) in the arm and threatens to kill her unless he is given St. Clair's address, and when he goes to the mansion he finds an auction going on in the basement. Many girls are being offered to the numerous bidders, and he is shocked when he sees Kim is the last girl on offer, and he forces a Middle Eastern bidder to purchase her, but before she can be collected he is captured and tied up, but he manages to get himself loose and kills the henchmen, and before killing him he forces St. Clair to tell him where his daughter has been taken. Bryan dashes and finds a luxury yacht owned by Raman the sheik (Nabil Massad), in a violent battle he kills the numerous guards aboard, the sheik himself is in his boudoir holding Kim with a knife to her throat, but her father shoots him in the head and saves her, Kim and her father return to the United States safe and sound and are reunited with Lenore and Stuart, and the ending sees Bryan introducing his daughter to singer Sheerah for her first singing lesson. Also starring Jonathan Gries as Casey and David Warshofsky as Bernie. Neeson is a fantastic choice as the middle-aged action hero with a ""particular set of skills"" who will stop at nothing to save his daughter, it is all about him to be honest, and the most memorable scene is him on the phone: ""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."" with the villain responding, ""Good luck."" The story is really gritty and gripping as the ex-serviceman hero goes from place to place searching or clues in tracking down his daughter, killing the bad guys along the way, the violence he uses to dispense of the villains are violent and part of the fun, an exciting and fantastically fun action drama. Good!"
"rjyelverton","4","4","11","30 January 2009"," Efficient and soulless
","Efficient and soulless. Borrowing a page from the Jack Bauer and Jason Bourne playbooks, Liam Neeson exacts cool revenge throughout the Paris underworld. Neeson plays former US secret agent Bryan Mills who is on a mission to track down and punish the men responsible for his daughter's kidnapping. His mission is equal parts payback and extraction. One suspects that retired agent Mills went on his mission as much for the opportunity to torture thugs as to get back his daughter Kim (played by Maggie Grace better known as Shannon on ""Lost."") Bryan Mills is always one step ahead of the bad guys, much stronger, faster, and more knowledgeable than his competition. He barely breaks a sweat. He dispatches whole rooms of thugs with bloody economy. Given Mills superiority and the frequent boss battles, ""Taken"" plays like a video game. Between bouts of fast mayhem, we see cut scenes of PG-13 torture and minimal exposition. This is a Jason Statham vehicle starring Liam Neeson.<br/><br/>Given the minimal sense of peril, the film's kicks are found mostly in the dispatching of bad guys. If you enjoy vicious headbutts, stabbings, and expert grappling, you'll find much to like. Bryan Mills is a great deal like Jason Voorhes--unstoppable and efficacious. ""Taken"" is an exercise in the current action style and this is disappointing coming from director Pierre Morel who gave us the off-the-wall, alive, ridiculous, and outstanding action film ""District B13."" ""Taken"" possesses little of the joy and verve of ""B13."" The palette of ""Taken"" is also dull and straightforward. Morel does this one by the numbers.<br/><br/>The best moment in ""Taken"" occurs early on as Mills wraps his daughter's birthday gift with OCD-like attention to detail. He carefully smooths down the paper and makes each fold sharp and distinct. It's a charming character moment, quiet and human."
"janborilden","3","9","33","17 July 2008"," A bit less than average action movie with a lot of killing
","I would first like to say that this is a quite OK action movie. If you are hangover from last night or just want to be entertained and doesn't want to thing about why things are happening, it is a movie to recommend. I have to admit that it did seem kind of strange to see Liam Neeson in a role better cut out for Steven Seagal or Chuck Norris, but than again he is a real actor, and I don't think he could have done the movie any worse (except that it would be more funny). The only thing that bothers a me a bit, is that the whole plot takes place in a alternative and different Europe. Nothing wrong with that really, but it can make people (like some of the other people writhing comments) believe that this is how the world is. It is not in any way like this, and nothing of it could have happened in real life. If you would like to see a movie about how human trafficking really is, you should either see a documentary, or a realistic movie like ""Lilja 4-ever"". Just wanted to let people know.."
"madpigmadpig","4","2","4","30 May 2014"," Cool concept, decent opening, poor execution of the main plot
","There were many excellent aspects to Taken. The whole opening sequence up until he meets his ex at the birthday was a fine example of character exposition. It told us that this man was a creature of habit, that he was careful, that he was a bit obsessive, that it was his daughter's birthday, that he was nervous and eager to please his daughter with the gift, that he was estranged from either his daughter or from a new family to which she belonged, and that his wife obviously left him and can be an extremely jerky woman.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, there were certain aspects of the writing which bothered me significantly as I watched and I couldn't help but write them down as it played. Many of these will only make sense if you've already seen it, but perhaps it's formulaic enough where that won't make any difference. There are probably some minor spoilers in here to the less aware though, so be warned. Here they are:<br/><br/>1. This super careful guy with ""skills"" didn't see fit to teach his daughter even the slightest common sense.<br/><br/>2. He doesn't use the cell phone he gave her as a tracking device.<br/><br/>3. When scumbags invade the apartment, he tells her to go to a bedroom and hide under the bed. Really!?!?!?!?! First of all, that's the first place anyone would look for her! Secondly, he should have tried to help her find a way to escape the apartment. No man experienced in escaping villains in his right mind would give this advice.<br/><br/>4. He tells her to leave the phone behind instead of secreting it on her person so he could, again, use it to track her. Seriously, it's not that hard to do.<br/><br/>5. After he knocks out the French sleazy guy's accomplice, he doesn't shove him in the back of the car before pursuing the French sleazy guy.<br/><br/>6. He makes his face known to the Albanian pimp/hooker that are in the trafficking chain.<br/><br/>7. He makes a commotion in the hooker den and gets himself in a bind instead of just quietly killing the john in the stall with his daughter's jacket and discreetly sneaking the hooker out to question her.<br/><br/>8. He warns the villain on the phone of who he is so that he can no longer take them by surprise, also making himself potentially vulnerable in the process.<br/><br/>9. He attacks the family of an old friend he finds out is a sleaze. Seriously, even the old Mafiosos know you don't attack the innocent members of someone's family because that's crossing the line and means that anything is on the table. He might as well have put a contract out on anyone he cared about for the future by doing something so careless and moronic.<br/><br/>10. Allows himself to get knocked out and captured because he's too stupid to look before exiting a door.<br/><br/>11. Escapes his captors through pure dumb luck (this is the least stupid one just because it's remotely plausible, but that still doesn't excuse it as lazy writing).<br/><br/>12. His daughter's line when he saves her is a surprised ""You came for me."" What kind of a !@#$%^& stupid line is that to write for such a moment? I have a suggestion: How about she says ""You're here"" and he replies ""I'll always be here for you."" Not perfect, but a darned sight better.<br/><br/>Also, it's not stupid per se, but it seems unnecessary to have the vocal coach bit at the end. The airport part had a purpose, but didn't completely hit home. They should have ended with a slice of the everyday life they had after it was all over to show what had been resolved in a lasting way. That would have been a more satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>I recently watched a much more strongly written international thriller named Hopscotch. If you're looking for something in this genre to watch, see this one instead."
"bo-297-426936","4","2","4","1 September 2013"," Good action but too exaggerated
","Charles Bronson - that is about all you can say about this movie. The old 70' movies Death Wish and Taken has one particular similarity - it is only worth seeing for the action and all the people the main character kills. Yes, you can say this about a number of movies - however this one is build around some kind of a realistic setting - still this guy can go to Paris and kill (or get killed) a few dozen people - including a few victim girls, and then fly back to the states as nothing ever happened.<br/><br/>Worst is not even that it is too exaggerated that the main character is so paranoid and then all the paranoia becomes reality just after the girls leave the airport, at least build up the story and make it just a bit realistic. The whole paranoia thing is not even needed for the story and they have too many stories going on - eg. the divorced and new rich husband. So he kill some people and becomes the hero? Or the travel around Europe thing, why? <br/><br/>No the worst is that not only all this happens, all the girls are turned into drug addicts and prostitutes within less than 48 hours. The subject are harsh enough as is, but here it is not treated very serious - the human trade is not depicted as a real issue, it is just a setting for him to kill some people and rescue his daughter."
"itamarscomix","4","2","4","7 August 2012"," A Paranoid's Wet Dream
","The only reason I'm giving Taken 4 stars rather than one or two is the fact that, admittedly, it's a well-executed action flick. It's been compared to movies like Die Hard and Lethal Weapon and indeed, despite the excessive use of hand held jittery cameras that place it firmly in the 2000's, it manages to create action scenes more coherent and flowing than almost any other movie made this decade; this combined with the short runtime makes me believe that I might have liked it a lot at age 11 or 12. Of course, it's not a movie that should be watched by a 12 year old kid, and that's just one of the reasons I consider it one of the most poorly conceived movies ever made.<br/><br/>Fans of Taken often defend it against the critics by claiming that it isn't meant to be taken seriously - that it's an escapist fantasy. The fact is that it's anything but. Rather than providing escape from reality, it's a movie that feeds on dangerous paranoia - the personal paranoia of over-protective, suffocating parents, and the collective paranoia of xenophobic patriots. The movie reinforces the paranoid fantasy that everybody is after your children and they will suffer greatly if you ever let them leave your sight for even a moment; that all foreigners are out to get you; and that if you ever step out of the comfort zone of your precious US of A, you'll immediately be kidnapped and sold as a prostitute. Of course, you can escape that fate, but only if your dad is a former CIA agent and proficient in various methods of murder and torture - the other victims aren't that lucky, as we can see that the loving father doesn't really give a damn about any of them (or about his daughter's good friend, either). Honestly, I'm really quite concerned about the effect this might have on people watching who have shades of notions of those fantasies already.<br/><br/>Which leads me to the second big problem - that the subject matter that supplies the plot for this alleged ""escapist fantasy"" is very realistic, very delicate and difficult, and is glossed over and trivialized magnificently. Apparently we aren't supposed to care that most of the victims of human trafficking aren't American tourists with cellphones and CIA dads to help them escape; the protagonist doesn't really care either. The movie suggests that human trafficking isn't really a problem, really, as long as we leave it to those primitive Europeans and don't let our own children go to that filthy continent. The truth is that human trafficking is a problem so global and so very real on a day-to-day basis, that the very fact that the movie tries to deal with it undermines any pretense to escapism.<br/><br/>Taken caters mainly to two groups - young teenagers, who'll enjoy the action and the overall coolness and in the process may be lead to believe that this is a realistic representation; and overprotective dads, for whom it will reinforce their biggest nightmares, and it may make their paranoia much more extreme. In both cases, the movie can do more harm than good; the protagonist is so cool and impressive (an admittedly strong performance from Liam Neeson) that those viewers are likely to idolize him. Indeed the movie never asks us to question his morality, and instead expects us to despise and villainize the more sensible mother, who's actually showing some healthy respect and trust in her daughter, and of course, the stereotypically balding, chubby and above all rich stepfather, who seems like a pretty decent guy but whom we're supposed to hate anyway because he doesn't share the biological dad's psychosis (and a wasted appearance by the wonderful Xander Berkeley, a superb character actor who here has to play a completely character-less character).<br/><br/>These are just some of my complaints about how dangerous and ill-conceived the movie is; I'm not even getting into the fact that it's completely and ridiculously unrealistic, and extremely poorly paced (the daughter literally meets her kidnapper when she's stepping off the plane, and is kidnapped about five minutes later). I also won't go into the fact that, while Neeson's character is ridiculously paranoid about his daughter going to the dark land of Mordor (France), he shows no qualms whatsoever about leaving her alone with a Christina Aguilera-like pop starlet who promises to get her into show business. Because there's no way that she'll give his daughter drugs, that her entourage will seduce her into decadent parties and orgies, or that her agent will take advantage of her? Oh right, I forgot. They're all Americans. That kinda stuff doesn't happen there."

","What would it be like if your dad was Jason Bourne and you were an American teen with a step-father with money to burn. Well you'd go to Europe, get kidnapped by evil Eastern Europeans intent on pumping you full of heroin and prostituting you to rich Asians. However, luckily your dad has been spending much of his career training for just such an event, and since he's now ""retired"" and he's got time on his hands he'll fly over to Europe and using his network of intelligence operatives and ninja skills, he'll bludgeon his way through the opposition, killing everyone in his path until he eventually finds you, and returns you to an everso grateful mom and stepdad. And they all live happily ever after.<br/><br/>Firstly, Neeson is a terrible choice for an action hero. The part was obviously made for Bruce Willis, and you can almost hear the dialogue being delivered in a Willisesque tone. Besson's writing has covered many bases, but this is a generic, paint-by-numbers action thriller with hints of torture porn. The basic story lacks any depth and the narrative is predictable. The Dialogue is dull and the cinematography is uninspiring. The film just clunks through the motions expected of a high octane action film, it pushes all those buttons, which is probably why it receives such a high rating on IMDb, but it brings nothing new to the table.<br/><br/>Dull, predictable and lacking any real depth.

","From the action point of view, there isn't much to add to other reviews: it's a brilliant movie displacing James Bond and Bourne and all the other action heroes. It's very well made.<br/><br/>So, I will only give a comment on a few things that some of you might want to know before you watch this film: The movie is extremely violent, and the use violence is never really questioned. Instead, violence is accepted even if affecting innocents. Further, the dark picture of Europe (France in particular) is absurdly overdone. OK, it's a dramatic element needed for the plot. But you can really spoil a kid's mind with these completely awkward ideas.<br/><br/>For adults, of course, it's a super cool movie. Enjoy!"

Anyway, this movie is FANTASTIC. Yes there are some things that could have been changed or bring up questions, BUT for the main part of the movie...it is SO good!!!<br/><br/>One thing I liked....is that Liam's character is a nightmare for the bad guys. Unlike Batman and other characters, Liam's character has NO problem leaving a trail of dead bad guys behind him as he moves along through the film, trying to find and save his daughter. I loved that...as a parent and a woman. Just getting rid of them after each bit of info. is disclosed, is fantastic. Saved the taxpayers money and at least slowed down the flow of bad guy deeds for a bit. <br/><br/>I would have liked to have known what happened to the girl Liam removes from the disgusting ""brothel"" and also it would have been fun to see the wife of that French gov. worker let him have it, for being involved in the whole kidnapping/prostitution ring. Whether he ""knew"" details or not....would have been nice for his life to crumble around him. <br/><br/>Love this movie...and didn't expect to at all. One comment referred to Bourne Identity and they have some similar moments. Not script or anything, but Liam is SO NATURAL when he fights..it doesn't look set up or choreographed and Matt Damon is the same way in the Bourne movies. Both actors are fantastic at making you think they are assassins/ex-spies etc. The fighting looked real and natural. And very impressive. <br/><br/>Oh, and the scene when he kills the disgusting sheik at the end? WOOHOO. I am so glad he just offed that repulsive man.

His many hindrances include his ex-wife and her new but rich husband. Vowing to find and retrieve his daughter, Mills will leave no stone unturned or friendship undisturbed including his old French Police friend Stuart (Xander Berkeley).

","This is addressed to the man who commented on Taken - giving it one star and basically insulting everyone who got something out of the movie. I understand there are times when the question - what has American come to should be asked. However, I do not think that it qualifies in this case. The question SHOULD be however, what has this world come to that stuff such as what was portrayed in this movie exists in real life. Now that is a valid question. Granted, this movie had some holes. It was not a documentary and therefore cannot be held to the same standards however ask yourself one thing: Did it cause you to be aware or meditate in any way, shape or form about what happens in trafficking? If so, then the move did it's job. It may not have been an academy award winning movie but it brought an awareness and may have caused many to reflect about what happens not only in our own backyard but if you chose to travel outside of the US. So sir, with all due respect, I don't think those that enjoyed the movie are the ones you should be examining - but rather yourself because heightened awareness should be the most important on affairs of social awareness - not whether or not Neeson can deliver a good kick to the head."

","Adverts for this film had me looking forward to, at the very least, a formulaic that cannot fail: Bad guys get their due by the hand of a righteous good guy. Vengeance is served somehow, and all that. Overall, the film delivers on its promise.<br/><br/>It is not exemplary in its genre however. I wish I could cite a title that really gives that satisfaction that is set up by the words 'I will find you and I will kill you'. A film or TV show that does that is a rare find.<br/><br/>To get that vigilante righteousness where you can applaud the protagonist for banging heads and killing everyone that crosses his/her path is a key issue. It most often requires that the antagonist be really really bad, to the point that that their crimes are so disturbing as to be unimaginable. This is perhaps why I cannot name a more satisfying film. I may have blocked it out.<br/><br/>Perhaps ""Die Hard"" could be called into play here, because I recall it was eminently satisfying and not too disturbing. But ""Die Hard"" does not exactly fit into this genre. It should not be a spoiler to say that kidnapping is an element of both, but that alone would hardly describe either film.<br/><br/>""Taken"" does not spend enough time on the guy that offered 'good luck'. You barely know who it is before it is gone from the story. Once you see it, you will agree that this is no spoiler, the film and the adverts did that already. Action sequences are implemented with more cuts than bristles on your toothbrush.<br/><br/>It is more convenient to have a series of action sequences filmed and then piece them together in an ineffective effort rather than choreograph them before the start. This shortcut has plagued many an otherwise good film and ""Taken"" is no exception. See, I just did that. You have no idea what I am saying.<br/><br/>I will now make it clear, this movie is not all that great. It was not bad, I enjoyed it. I watched it alone and was expecting to re-watch it with someone else once I could recommend it, but I cannot.

Sit back and enjoy the show. And I like how Besson doesn't shy away about killing (very) bad guys. A lot of movies have their protagonist go through ethical and moral contortions before taking a life, no matter how much that life deserves to be taken. Neeson's character has no such compunctions. He's getting his daughter and God help anybody who gets in his way.

","There is no denying that ""Taken"" does belong to the group of mediocre no-brainer action movies. As a story, it moves from point A to B to C with a lot of stylized, violent action in between. But all the same, there is something very rewarding about it. Being a classic vendetta story of a father (with a CIA past) finding his kidnapped daughter in a foreign country, the movie becomes much more personal to watch than most other movies of the same caliber, and a huge part of that, if not entirely, is thanks to Liam Neeson, who plays the role with an emotional fervor only he can pull of. Similar to ""Frantic"" (1988) in both nature and setting (but with much more violence), ""Taken"" sets up a hopeless situation and brings the viewer along on a ride of revenge. The only problem is, we kind of already know where it ends."

","I have to admit that I started watching this movie with my breath held. Let's face it, Liam Neeson is not exactly known for bringing the action. Perhaps that's why I liked this so much...not only does Neeson deliver believable action but he damn near rocks your face off.<br/><br/>My experience with Neeson is fairly limited, I'll admit. Yeah, he was in the new Star Wars flicks, but I didn't much care for those and Batman Begins which was fine but he was pretty much absent from that. And then there's Nell. We'll not discuss that. Long story short I always knew Liam Neeson as the guy who always looked like he was just about to start crying (even when he's smiling). Needless to say I was more than a bit surprised when he breaks out into his bad-ass alter ego for Taken. I would liken him in this flick to a slightly more aged Jason Bourne...his action sequences are fluid and impressive but still very based in reality without a ton of flash.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also pretty good. Famke Janssen is fine if just as cold and uncaring as she is in pretty much everything. A post-Lost Maggie Grace does well as the daughter who's abducted (ok, all she really does is scream and cry, but she fits the bill for the part). I almost didn't recognize her since she comes across looking a lot younger even though it was made after she was killed off on Lost. All in all it's really a shame this movie didn't ever (to my knowledge) see serious theater time. It's every bit as good as anything in theaters right and in many cases better. It's definitely worth your time. I'm almost hoping Neeson keeps this up even though I'm pretty sure he won't."

","Taken (2008) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>A former CIA agent (Liam Neeson) has his world turned upside down after his daughter goes to Paris for a vacation and gets kidnapped. He's an expert of this type of thing and it's going to take all his skills to locate her with the short amount of time he has. If you wanted to pick this film apart you really could because it's certainly far fetched and everything Neeson can do here isn't really believable and what he's able to do isn't really believable. With that said, who in the hell cares? Even though the story isn't that believable there's no denying this is a first rate thriller that will have you biting your nails from the moment the daughter gets taken all the way till the end. This movie has a simple story but Neeson takes it to a whole new level and really makes this film seem plausible. I mentioned it wasn't believable but this never comes through while you're watching the film because Neeson is so wonderful in the film you're willing to go along with him on this journey no matter where it takes you. The movie is extremely fast paced, well made and delivers on all levels. The action is first rate, the suspense is top-notch and Neeson performance is downright wonderful. I can't think of an actor who would have been better in the role. This is an action movie but with someone like Neeson it just brings the film up several notches. Again, you could pick apart how his character goes about doing things but just sit back and enjoy the ride. The film is very stylish in terms of the cinematography and it also features a very good music score to pump up all the action. In a lot of ways the film reminded me of another underrated gem and that's BREAKDOWN, the 1997 thriller with Kurt Russell playing a man looking for his wife who seems to have vanished out of nowhere. The two films deal with a simple kidnapping but both have a great actor to pull everything together so if you did enjoy this film you're highly recommended in checking out the other."

","Taken is a taut action thriller starring the somewhat improbable Liam Neeson as the avenging hero.<br/><br/>Neeson is somewhat of an everyman actor, very believable in everyday hero roles that Tom Cruise and the like could never do. It is this versatility that is his great strength as an actor – see his roles as Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars and the legendary Irish hero Michael Collins in the film of the same name for further evidence of this. But as Brian Mills, the loving father and retired CIA operative, he brings a new intensity to the fore, and the film is all the more satisfying for it. Brian has seen how the world works and wants to protect his daughter from it. But after his daughter is kidnapped on a trip to Paris, Brian must dust off his skills that have lain dormant in order to rescue his daughter and punish those responsible.<br/><br/>After taking a little too much time to set events in motion (considering it is only a 90 minute film) the pace and power accelerates rapidly, and you find yourself slowly gripped by the single-minded intensity of ex-spy Ben. While you remain sure that the outcome is inevitable, the method and projected body count remain in question, and it is this that makes the film such an enthralling tale. Some good, if not particularly spectacular, set-pieces, keep the pace moving quickly, while the vast range of 'special skills' Ben displays throughout the film ensure we never lose sight of who it is we're dealing with. The film wears its emotions on its sleeve, giving the film a raw feel, which all adds to the gut-wrenching intensity. As the plot thickens and more layers become apparent – including corruption within the gendarmes – you are left asking yourself 'how far would you go to rescue someone you love? What lengths would you go to?' Ben's methods become morally ambiguous at best, if not outright questionable, but as we see more of the seedy underbelly of Paris and how far it extends, the slightly sour taste that has been growing from the we discover the truth behind his daughter's abduction becomes quite uncomfortable. The rather surprisingly high level of violence adds to this level of discomfort, yet the violence never seems to feel gratuitous.<br/><br/>Neeson is a man who can deliver quiet intensity like few others can, but the fury he displays never seems to rise much above a whisper – no matter how much training a spy may get, surely nothing could prepare someone for the kidnap of their daughter? A slight increase in volume of emotions would have benefited somewhat. Meanwhile, Maggie Grace as Ben's daughter has little to do other than look severely distressed and frightened, while the villains are largely nameless and faceless. The lack of a single clearly identifiable villain, while ensuring the focus remains solely on Ben's search for his daughter, dilutes the fury and vengeance factor somewhat. However, Taken remains a riveting narrative, unfettered by the convoluted machinations that frequently litter CIA-based films. By taking the spy out of the CIA, the story is free to focus on the action-based thrills rather than the political ones, and is all the better for it. In fact, with a sub-90 minute runtime the audience is left feeling slightly short-changed on plot, and an additional twenty minutes to develop Neeson's character further, maybe even displaying some bursts of uncontrolled rage at some point, would not have harmed the movie in any way.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, with TV series like Alias having made the spy genre somewhat stale, Taken shows there is no substitute for seeing this kind of story as a full-blown action thriller on the big screen. Genuinely gripping."
"hangmansjoke666","10","2","4","30 March 2009"," An Excellent Liam Neeson!!!!
","Wow! First of all i have to say i like Liam Neeson very much as an actor. But most movies i have seen he has played drama and sensible roles. But this time he did the same as Denzel Washington did in ""Man on Fire"", he showed the hard side of himself. The story itself is nothing really new: a man (this time actually a retired spy or secret agent) divorced and alone wants to get his family together or at least wants to get up to his daughter. And on a trip to Paris with a good friend both, his daughter and her friend, get kidnapped.<br/><br/>I think what makes this movie special is the behavior of the father in this whole thing (which comes from one of the best writers for good movies...luc besson), on the one side he stays really calm for he already knows his daughter will be kidnapped in the next few minutes and on the other side this fury, anger and also desperation with only one thing on his mind...finding his daughter somewhere in Paris.<br/><br/>this movie is really worth to watch!"
"dreamdemon-1","10","2","4","30 March 2009"," The no-nonsense action thriller
","I must say that hearing about Liam Neeson in a French action movie kinda filled me with hope of seeing something different that the usual Bonds and I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>Surely, this isn't a 'deep' movie, it's pure adrenaline and the best part is that it doesn't try to pretend to be anything else.<br/><br/>Aside from this, the movies does break some of the 'action hero stereotypes'. Neeson doesn't see any innocents in his path. He beats his way to his daughter, the only one he protects (in a way) is his Albanian translator, but (for example) he shoots his former french contact's wife even though she had nothing to do with anything.<br/><br/>Neeson's hero does the talking and he simply expects answers. I loved the way he shot Saint-Clair every time he tried to say anything except the answer he was expecting or how he shot the kidnapper before the guy had a chance to offer a settlement (also his line 'To me it was always personal' when Saint-Clair explains it was only business - i waited ages for this line to shut up all the good/bad guys who claim their deed was 'just business', who cares what it was to you? to me it's different).<br/><br/>All in all, the movie presets itself nicely. The cinematography s OK, no funny motion effects to make you throw up, it's functional and it delivers.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is good, a combination between classic rock and some orchestral sound that adds to some moments, although not always in sync.<br/><br/>The acting is better than average for this kind of movies, though I'm sure everyone would agree that it doesn't take up a lot of talent. Still Neeson brings in some extra value.<br/><br/>Plot holes? Nothing major. The writers took care to make Neeson an ex-CIA which accounts for his access to contacts, intelligence and various equipments, not to mention his martial arts skill and dead-shot accuracy.<br/><br/>Speaking English in France is attributed to Albanians being new to Paris (God knows thugs don't go to school for years to learn a new language before going somewhere).<br/><br/>A couple of nags include Neeson escaping the police after stealing the cab (sure, the other lane was packed, but no police cars responded and came down his lane??) and escaping after being handcuffed to a pipe by loosening it (clearly he had to escape, but this is too close to Deus-ex-machina for an otherwise decent action script) and on top of that he escapes in one move, although the pipe was clearly longer than his arm-span (which would have required him to take at least a step back).<br/><br/>All in all, ""Taken"" is a very nice surprise this year, although if you want food for the brain and nag-free movie, look elsewhere."
"peaceloverasta27","7","2","4","22 March 2009"," Great action but nothing you haven't seen before.
","Let me start this off by saying I adore Liam Neeson and all he does. I really did like the action in this flick and I liked how it focused on forced prostitution rather than the typical we-have-your-child-now-pay-us-a-ransom plot. I'm probably the only one who didn't feel too sorry for Kim, though. The mother was also beyond irresponsible.<br/><br/>Mum: Let's let our already-spoiled 17 year old brat roam around Europe following U2 on tour and lie to her father about it; tell him you'll be going to museums and such. You'll sound much more smart. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson: (finds out his daughter will not be staying in France) You lied to me?!?!<br/><br/>Mum: She had to, she couldn't tell you the truth.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson: (after telling Kim a dozen times to call him once she lands, doesn't get the phone call. Calls his ex-wife)<br/><br/>Mum: She's 17 and in Paris...give her space.<br/><br/>So there you go, dear mumsy. Now your daughter is kidnapped by weird Albanians and some random Arab Shiek that's involved and what's more...she is now in the process of being sold as a sex slave. And you think your ex-husband was smothering her?<br/><br/>And as for Kim's friend Amanda? That chick got what she deserved. ""I'm gonna sleep with that French guy we just met 2 minutes ago because I hear the French are great in bed."" That's nice hun, now you can sleep with all the guys you want now that you're BEING SOLD TO THEM.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, forced prostitution is not something you can turn the other cheek about. I just didn't feel attached to Kim and Amanda because I was too busy being angry at the fact that her and her mother lied to her father. I was also too busy being angered that the mother seemed so damn careless. I don't know about the rest of you folks, but a good mother wouldn't consent right away to letting her underage daughter roam freely around Europe without being concerned and being able to sleep comfortably at night.<br/><br/>In conclusion: Liam Neeson is an awesome superhero dad, the action is great, but I just don't feel attached or remorse for Kim, Amanda, and the thoughtless mother."

","The recipe for Bonds Martini is as follows: From the book written by Ian Flemming in 1953 ""Casino Royale"" <br/><br/>3 parts Gordon's Gin and only one part Vodka<br/><br/>I would counter that Neeson is the Gin in Bonds Martini...<br/><br/>There are many decent and well made movies about an American Kickass Hero Archetype character goes over seas to deal death and destruction on the doers of evil. Most of the good movies give a valid motive based love or an unknown circumstance. The Bourne Movies fit the latter of these motives and are very affective at staying on the edge and bringing you deeper into the movie...<br/><br/>Taken is such a perfectly stepped vector of a storyline and maintaining relative believability it is hard to look away from the screen.<br/><br/>My first real taste of Liam was in ""Darkman"" when I was 15 and he took a fantastical unbelievable character and gave it depth and even humor. The choices Liam has made in the roles he has taken on have given him such a range of characters that doing one of the more overdone general genres makes this movie special. There are some questions I have in regards to how Laim makes his Parisian charge. If I had access to friends that are in the business of security and international military experience I would bring them along for the ride. Liam decides to use them only sparingly...allows us to focus on Liam alone in this Mission Impossible like movie.<br/><br/>I try to imagine another actor in Liam's role...like Steven Seagal, Sylvester Stallone, Arnie, Vin Diesel and so on but Liam is so far away from the the typical Action Hero and does such a better job than all these guys...<br/><br/>It comes down to great writing, and Directing. Pierre Morel being the Cinematographer for ""Danny the Dog"" and The Transporter movies knows what works in these types of movies. Direct no bullshit dialog with a time line that brings the viewer along each level getting more intense.<br/><br/>Don't stand in either of Liam Neeson's or Pierre Morel's way unless you are going to watch this movie. There may never be another one like this one again...at least not with Liam Neeson gaining years in it.<br/><br/>The Professional or ""Leon"" is Jean Reno and Taken is Liam Neeson! Everything in the sky has aligned to make a rare viewing experience of an over done genre. Enjoy this movie"

","The movie has some bad points - somewhat cartoonish characters and plot, speaking English when one should've been speaking French, etc.<br/><br/>However, it's still awesome. It's an action movie, and I usually look for two things there: good action, and a believable explanation as to why it's happening. Both Bourne and Bond movies fail in those respects, whereas Taken is successful.<br/><br/>I didn't see anything superhuman about the protagonist, yeah he's good at shooting, hand-to-hand and driving but that's it. He took a lot of risks (notably when his car gets shot up with an automatic .308, that could've penetrated enough to kill him), but there's nothing impossible about what he's doing.<br/><br/>A lot of people mention racial stereotypes - come on. The movie is set in France, which nationality do you want the corrupt cops to be? Brazilian? And yeah it's horrible how movie portraits the Albanian mafia, I mean they've only been dominating drug&slave trade in Paris for the last ten years or so and people already start showing it in movies.<br/><br/>So yes Taken could've been less cliché as far as the story goes, but that story is superbly presented"

Using the skills that he attains from the government, he tracks down the culprit that kidnapped his daughter and punish them.<br/><br/>I honestly did not believe that Liam Neeson can kick some ass, but in this movie he certainly looked the part. Liam Neeson is basically playing an older version of Jason Statham in this movie. He goes around whacking everyone that is in his way and does it very convincingly.<br/><br/>Maggie Grace plays his daughter.

"cchase","8","2","4","1 March 2009"," You're Not Getting Older, You're Getting DEADLIER...
","Okay, so before I even start this one, let's go over all the quibbles, shall we? First and most noticeable is LOST'S Maggie Grace allegedly playing a teenager. We all know she probably was a little more ""mature"" than even her character on the infuriatingly obtuse ABC hit, but did we care then? No, we didn't, so why all the fuss now? The cast of the original 90210 were a bunch of college-age (or WAY past college-age) actors playing teens, too, and that was still a hit. So to those nitpickers, get a life already.<br/><br/>Next is the script. Dialogue that's less than cerebral? Check. Plot holes you could drive a Mack truck through? Double-check. That feel of trying to go after Matt Damon's BOURNE franchise and steal some of its audience? Check, check and check again. But then this movie is co-produced by Luc Besson (THE PROFESSIONAL, THE FIFTH ELEMENT, THE LAST COMBAT) who wrote TAKEN'S script with Robert Mark Kamen (THE KARATE KID) and was directed by Pierre Morel (the 'parkour'-infused post-apocalyptic thriller DISTRICT B-13.) If you came to this party expecting Bergmann or Bunuel, my friend, you just walked into the wrong freakin' party.<br/><br/>Once you've adjusted your suspension of disbelief accordingly, you will realize what the true pleasure of TAKEN really is - and that's watching renowned, Oscar-and-Tony-nominated stage and screen actor Liam Neeson, now close to 60, step into the same arena as Damon, Jason Statham, Daniel Craig and his action-hero contemporary, Harrison Ford, and kick ass and take names with a panache that would make Jack Bauer beam with admiration. At least that's what I enjoyed the most about it. <br/><br/>Neeson plays former government-operative-turned-security-consultant (read: bodyguard) Bryan Mills. Long retired from the more active aspect of his trade, he spends his time trying to maintain some facade of civility with his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen doing well in yet another thankless role) and her new rich gasbag of a husband (Xander Berkeley, ditto), so he can still maintain close ties with the one thing in his life that matters: his daughter, Kim (Grace.)<br/><br/>When Kim and her BFF are allowed to take an ill-advised European vacation that delivers them right into the clutches of some foreign baddies specializing in the sex slave trade, Mills gets to spring into action in what is the quintessential older man's fantasy...becoming the super-action hero with mad fighting skills and endless resources that can be brought to bear, in order to do whatever it takes to kill the bad guys and save the damsel-in-distress - said 'damsel' in this case being your teenage daughter. <br/><br/>Yes, there's plenty of accusations you can level at TAKEN: the further glorification of lawless violence (anyone who thinks that Neeson's Mills should be concerned about the rights of the criminals he obliterates is in for quite the profound shock); the more-than-obvious xenophobia (almost all the bad guys are Middle Eastern or something very close to it); the chauvinistic aspect of the story line (Mom's willfulness is what sets the whole mess in motion, when it turns out that ""Father Knew Best"" after all the entire time.) <br/><br/>But every action movie (Besson's especially) carries aspects of all these concerns. That having been said, if I'm going to see a film like TAKEN, I am not going to search for signs of political correctness. I want to see some greasy, sleazy, skeevy underworld types get their teeth and heads knocked in, and in that respect, this movie delivers, and just like actors half his age doing it, Neeson looks spectacular, as he moves and carries himself like the guy who can and will do whatever it takes to get the job done...especially when that job is saving and bringing home his loved ones.<br/><br/>Yes, I've heard all the complaints, but what I really want to know is when Liam's going to step into Bryan Mills' shoes again? With all due respect to Kiefer Sutherland, maybe Mills is what '24' needs on the day Jack Bauer is permanently retired from CTU...or what's left of it."
"retasulover","5","2","4","21 February 2009"," A Very Nice Thriller
","Having just returned from the theaters to see this movie, I am happy to announce that although this film wasn't phenomenal, I was indeed pleased with what I got. Liam Neeson has always been able to pull through every role he's been given, and this is no exception. However, I did always think L.N. was more fitted for a softer, gentlemanly role.<br/><br/>The dangers that the protagonist of this film faces to save his daughter are very dark when it comes to realism. His daughter has been abducted by an underground circuit of Albanian crooks who abduct traveling girls, drug them, and sell them on the streets or in private auctions for prostitution.<br/><br/>The original score for this film is somewhat memorable, as it delivers a certain unsettling effect, almost as if it's a warning for the obstacles to come, which is a commendable attempt in the film world.<br/><br/>Something I've never really appreciated in movie advertisements, is when they put an actor or actresses name in the posters Top 3 names, and then that same actor or actress is barely in the movie at all. I basically call this the ""Christopher Lee + LOTR + Star Wars III Effect"".<br/><br/>All in all, when it comes to thrills, atmosphere, and overall effect, Taken is not a terrible film, but it's not a great film. It nets a perfect 50/50 in my book. I still recommend it to anyone who is looking for smooth action throughout the entire 93 minutes of this film."

You know, this movie might be PG-13, but just the material in it deserves an R rating. But anyways, I saw this movie yesterday and frankly, after all the crap I read in the newspaper on this movie, I don't understand how such a good movie can get away with such low reviews. Time in this movie moves by really fast, and I give an average of a stunt per minute to this movie. This thing literally boosts your adrenaline and you are not bored a minute. I even found it more entertaining than Quantum Of Solace (I'd give QOS an 8/10, but I haven't reviewed it yet).<br/><br/>Story: Bryan Mills is a retired agent of the CIA.

Liam Neeson was fantastic in this movie and did a terrific job, and the visual effects were pretty good also. I will probably buy this movie as soon as it is released on DVD.<br/><br/>So, Taken is a good movie to watch.

Basically it can be summed up like this: Man has someone he loves taken from him. Man then does anything, and I MEAN anything, to try and get said loved one back. Many, many dead people later man gets loved one back. That's about it. But the action is almost non-stop once it gets going, and I can honestly say that I was thoroughly entertained for most of this movie (the first fifteen minutes, and the last two I could have done without). Neeson is not as polished looking as Matt Damon. He's not even as rugged or as tough looking as Daniel Craig. But he plays this character in the way it was meant to be played. He's the type of person you can believe in...literally. When he says he's going to do something, he does it (and then some). Is this movie going to win any awards? No. Is it going to be in many people's top ten? Probably not. But, and nowadays this is pretty doggone important, it will get you your ten bucks worth.

","You've seen the plot of TAKEN before: A former CIA operative's daughter is kidnapped and is to be sold into a life of slavery and prostitution. He immediately goes after the kidnapers. The action takes us from Los Angeles to Paris and back. Liam Neeson is the operative and Famke Janssen is the ex-wife; otherwise, the cast is largely made up of an army of stuntmen, all on hand to be mowed down by Neeson in his quest to retrieve his daughter. What makes the movie work are the incredible fight sequences, which are plentiful and modeled on the fight sequences in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY. Since the movie is rated PG-13, there is no blood to speak of, but the violence feels real enough and Neeson is believable as a killing machine who cannot be stopped or even slowed down. No surprises plot-wise, and the story is told in strictly linear form, but wow, those fight scenes. A French film written by Luc Besson. Movie buffs may be reminded of TARGET with Gene Hackman and FRANTIC with Harrison Ford."

The hand of Besson is writ large across (he was a writer for the film) showing us Paris as the dynamic backdrop for this movie of retribution. It's hard not compare it with Harrison Ford in Frantic, but Liam Neeson as the hard man is an intensely satisfying experience as he carves a swathe of death through the suburbs. I found myself shaking watching it as the adrenaline kicked in, and he shows that adrenaline rush in many scenes. The acting of all concerned is believable and I never found myself questioning motives or behaviour. The only reason I do not give this ten-out-of-ten is the ease with which he rampages through Paris without substantial police interference, and the rather contrived final ending. Hollywood has to have a little cherry on top of the ice cream. Well worth seeing, whether you are a boy or girl, for a rush of juicy adrenaline."

It was fantastic. I rate Taken an 8. In the hands of more expected actors (like those listed above) this would have been a 5, 6 at best.<br/><br/>Item of Note: This movie was PG13 and for the life of me I don't know how it was given this rating.

","I have to describe this movie with The Bourne Movies as a Frame of Reference. First of all, this movie wouldn't work unless it was someone like Liam Nesson starring. HE is the movie. The movie is focused on him kicking major donkey. Storywise this movie is very weak. It plays off the stereotype that everyday, thoughtless girls run to Europe and get kidnapped and all manner of horrible things happen. Furthermore, the parts of the movie that aren't good guy v. bad guy, are borderline crap. Some of its bad acting, but most of it is just mediocre directing and editing in those areas. DON'T watch this movie expecting an awesome web of lies for a story, its straightforward enough to be a video game. <br/><br/>Now with all that said, the Action is quite EPIC. The moves Neeson pulls in many of these scenes (even though they're probably not actually Neeson] are on the level of Jason Bourne greatness. IF one simply wants to see a movie with THRILLING ACTION MOMENTS! and INTENSE SEQUENCES! in between, then this movie is a perfectly good use of 8 bucks.<br/><br/>But personally, if I really wanted to see it just because, I'd go with the matinée."
"JasonTrent","8","2","4","31 January 2009"," What do they know?
","Critics continue to be disengaged from the general public. Taken is a classic example. Overall the consensus among viewers is that Taken is an enjoyable thriller with a slightly different twist on the ""agent"" taking on the baddies. Liam Neeson is fun to watch, and the pace move along nicely. Its one of thew few movies of a year of bad movies that leaves pleasant memories behind.<br/><br/>Mind you, I am a fan of the previous work done by this crew. District B-13 I found was a great movie, with amazing action scenes. Having said that, when I began Taken I wasn't quite sure what to expect. What ensued was a father in hot pursuit of his kidnapped daughter through the seedier side of France. The movie preaches no message, and makes no pretense that it is anything but a ""fun"" movie. So why is it that critics cannot sit back and see what we see? Trust the viewers on this one. If you're in the mood for a great action flick, Taken will be right up your alley. If on the other hand you are a struggling artiste trying to glean the deep philosophical meanings of films produced by similar tortured artists, you might want to take a pass."

","(Synopsis) Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) retired from the CIA as a black ops field agent so he could be close to and reconnect with his 17-year old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Kim wants to go to Paris with a friend, but she must get her father's permission to leave the country. Bryan knows how dangerous the world is and doesn't want her to go, but he reluctantly gives his consent when she turns on her tears. He gives her a cell phone and wants her to call him everyday. After just arriving in Paris, Kim is talking on the phone with her father when she sees that several men have broken into the apartment and have grabbed her friend. Bryan tells her to hide under the bed and when they grab her, to yell out anything she can identify about the men. Bryan talks to one of the kidnappers and warns him to let his daughter go. ""But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."" The kidnapper replies with ""Good Luck."" <br/><br/>(My Comment) The movie covers the topic of young women being kidnapped by Albanian sex traffickers who hook them on drugs and sell them into prostitution. Using his CIA contacts, Bryan learns that Marco is the man he was talking to on the phone, and that he only has a maximum of 96 hours to find Kim, before she is never heard from again. Bryan flies to Paris and is in a race against time to find Kim. He uses all his skills to track her kidnappers down, and when he finds one, he extracts information and takes out his retribution. Liam Neeson is the good guy who will not stop for anything to find his daughter. You will love his character seeking revenge and feel for him while he is doing it. The best line in the movie is the line when Bryan is talking on the phone to Marco, because that is what any parent would want to say to any kidnapper. There is non-stop action after Bryan arrives in Paris. The hand to hand action is nicely done. The story is straightforward with no plot twists and predictable, but it doesn't matter. It will hold your interest and enjoyable to watch him take out the bad guys. (20th Century Fox, Run Time 1:34, Rated PG-13) (8/10)"
"Lacerna6413","8","2","4","30 January 2009"," 'Man on Fire' meets 'The Bourne Identity'
","This movie immediately caught my interest when I first saw the trailer, and thankfully, it was everything I thought it would be.<br/><br/>'Taken' stars Liam Neeson as a retired CIA operative, desperately trying to rekindle his relationship with his estranged daughter. So when she suddenly springs the idea of traveling to Paris with one of her friends, he very reluctantly allows her to go in an attempt to get her to take him back into her life. Before his daughter could see the Eiffel Tower, Neeson's worst fears are realized, and his daughter is kidnapped and dragged off, only to leave a very determined Liam Neeson to recover her.<br/><br/>At 97 minutes, this movie is short, sweet, and to the point. Initially, I was worried if Liam Neeson may have been miscast, as this is not usually the sort of roles we are used to seeing him in, but he shows us a hardcore, and welcomed side of his acting. The action sequences are well done and well timed. Neeson is as resourceful as he is brutal in this role. You see the determination of Denzel Washington from 'Man on Fire', with the moves of Jason Bourne in Neeson's performance. All in all, a very entertaining movie and a welcomed change of pace from Liam Neeson."

","Before I got this movie on DVD, I had never heard of the director. I wasn't even sure whether I should spend an hour and a half watching it; my father convinced me otherwise.<br/><br/>Taken, directed by Pierre Morel, is the story of a father's limitless love for his daughter. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a strict, colorless and reserved father who wants nothing other than his daughter's love. He is so desperate for her acceptance, he allows her to take a vacation with her friend to Paris even though he knows much too well the trouble she could encounter. The situation is made even more irritating for Bryan when he finds out Paris isn't the only stop on his daughter's list.<br/><br/>The movie starts off a bit slow, but quickly speeds up with Bryan's quest to avenge his daughter's kidnapping; you'll soon find out Bryan isn't the dull character he first appeared. He is calm and clever, tying together all the clues to find his daughter. Some of the stunts may seem over the top, but are still believable. And all action sequences are beautifully choreographed, leaving you wondering, ""What will he do next?!""<br/><br/>Taken is a film based on the human trafficking industry that asks every viewer the same question, ""Why aren't we taking more action to crack down on this destructive industry?"" Many truths about our world are revealed in a movie that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat!"

","""Taken"" is a typical action movie, but it is pretty entertaining. I wouldn't call this movie amazing or anything like that. However, it puts you on the edge of your seat. It's full of action, mainly Liam Neeson beating the crap out of people in various ways, and with a good right to do so. The plot is a little hokey, as I highly doubt the likeliness of certain situations present in the movie. It is a movie though, and we know it is not real. So, it has great entertainment value, a typical style action plot, and not too much character development. Is it the best action flick? No, but it is pretty good and has some nice beat downs. Not bad at all and worth the watch."
"rzajac","Null","2","4","15 January 2009"," Good for the genre
","I normally don't go out for action flicks, so I was sort of surprised by how Taken picked me up on a wave and carried me pretty well through, though with a few hiccups along the way.<br/><br/>But, in the end, it's just an action flick. It's pretty predictable stuff, hence, no danger of ""spoiling"" it. To wit: Enormously talented security dude, estranged from his family (because of his line of work), but still deeply loves his daughter. She's kidnapped. Dad jumps into the frey, saves his daughter. End of story! Lots of entertaining sleuthing, lots of kicking ass, occasional serious breaches of believability: Dad tells daughter ""don't go to Paris""...accused of paranoia...and, of course, the daughter is promptly kidnapped by Albania's only export to the West; politically-correct gangsters. Hero, faced with bursts of near-point-blank automatic gun fire, is not hit. He shoots a Paris police big-wig's wife in the arm, crashes many cars, kills many people; yet, when the action is finished, he hops on a plane with his daughter to fly back to the States.<br/><br/>Some great subtlety in handling and pacing, but occasional firehose action sequences (esp. toward the end, natch) where you feared you were watching ""just another"" action flick.<br/><br/>I really do appreciate acting professionalism; and Liam Neeson is an absolute wonder. Great actors can do *anything*, and that's why Liam gets the big bucks.<br/><br/>The main reason I watched this was because I saw Besson's name on it, and he gave us such great tours-de-force... I expected something like that, and instead I got a quite tolerable action flick treat.<br/><br/>No moral complexity; real white/black hat stuff.<br/><br/>Quite good for the genre. Even if action flicks aren't your bag, you might want to try this one out, to recalibrate your attitudes a little."

","Very surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. I thought it was terrific. It doesn't try to do too much or try and trick the viewer. It is a very well crafted story of Liam Neeson kicking some ass. Good plot, good action, good casting. A+ in my book. Hope you all go to see it. This is the first time I can recall seeing Liam in an action movie actually DOING the majority of the action (he didn't really fight much in Batman Begins), and I thought he performed brilliantly. Famke Janssen (and I know I am probably butchering the spelling of these names) also plays a great role. Any normal parent can consider the Mother she plays as just a horrible mom; letting your kids do whatever/whenever. Needless to say, by the end of the movie, I think she learned her lesson. <br/><br/>I even liked the smaller roles the other ex-'preventers' played. Their appearances were brief, yet powerful and very well done. Hope you all feel the same way I did after seeing this. It could be a surprise box office smash."
"johnny-08","7","2","4","7 January 2009"," Let Liam Neeson take you into ""Taken""!
","""Taken"" is not another stupid action thriller of B production with bad actors and low budget; ""Taken"" is what modern action thriller should look like, written by Luc Besson, directed by Pierre Morel and brilliantly acted by one and only Liam Neeson. Neeson brings completely new approach to his character and proves that you don't need to have tons of muscles to be an action star (he's 56 remember!!); he has the height, style, approach, in one word: he's cool! Above everything he is a great actor and he proves that once again. I could go on and on talking about Neeson but I want to say a few things about this movie. Following path of revenge Besson takes us on a ride that is full of action and the whole story is told in beautiful simplicity. It doesn't present nothing new, but the way the whole movie was filmed, with amazing action scenes (some of them brutal like electricity torture) and great actor in main role, you gotta' be satisfied with final outcome. And yes, you know that he's going to save everyone but then again Seagal also saves everyone but 95% of his movies are stupid. That is the magic of this movie cause Besson didn't present anything new. You just need to have passable script, good, young director, be European and have good actor in main role. All I can say, just let Liam Neeson take you into ""Taken""!"
"krgene","9","2","4","8 November 2008"," Tensile!
","A satisfying addition to the Revenge/Action Thriller genre. Its portrayal of violence is reminiscent of Cronenberg's History of Violence, which is to say that every attack is decisive, every punch bone-cracking, every trigger pulled multiple times without hesitation. A ruggedly restrained Liam Neeson ties the whole package together nicely. Luc Besson seems to have really hit his stride here with a newly-realized economy of cinematic language. This is a lean, mean fighting film, nothing flabby about it, not a moment wasted. Although I agree with some of the comments other users have posted about Maggie Grace's seeming misinterpretation of her character's age (perhaps this was a directorial gaffe?), in terms of pure popcorn entertainment value and tight narrative adherence to its basic premise of personal justice, the film deserves a 9/10."
"ashsdarr","7","2","4","7 November 2008"," Action and Nothing Else
","This movie will satisfy those looking for thorough action, gun fights, slash h2h combats. I liked it. The plot is a lil weak, no real message or moral to learn from unless you are Albanian and have kidnapped Liams daughter. I liked it, except for the instances where things occurred so conveniently for Liams character, eg the correct villain said ""good luck"" the 1st time around also it was so easy to analyze the phone call to exactly pin point the main kidnapper. But the action and fight choreography was very very good. Liam looks and fits the profile for a highly talented deadly retired CIA agent. His combat moves were fluent like he had been doing it for years. I was yearning for a good action flick with the same type of action (forget storyline and plot twists) as the Bourne movies displayed. His emotions and love for his daughter was very nicely conveyed, and i was really ""taken"" aback when she is under the bed and he has to tell her that she will be kidnapped. No lags, just constant pursuit of his goal. Good for me"

","I have been looking for some action this month and this piece satisfied me well enough. There is a great job from the director and especially from the camera and cut although it misses some points to excellence.<br/><br/>The main idea - retired ""James Bond"" - Bryan (Liam Neeson) saving his daughter in Paris - is simple but efficient. It provides all the action we need. Liam really stands out and outdoes himself. The movie is not too long, I would say just the right time, it keeps you thrilled for the most of the scenes. He is self-confident, sure of himself and desperate to find his Kim. This is the good part - believable.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there was time when I thought ""how the hell could this happen ?!"" I mean, some facts are not so convincing. There is too much luck and accidents that favor Bryan. I just could not go with it. In the end there is a little twist, but this is not enough. Bryan always knows where to go and what to do. And if he gets caught, hanging bound waiting for execution, he escapes the death miraculously. But I guess this is just the way the movies are turned today..<br/><br/>Despite this, I think the movie is well worth watching. Its not disgusting but of course without some corpses would be no action and no fun. Enjoy the show! :)"
"estebangonzalez10","9","2","4","24 September 2008"," Liam Neeson is a Man On Fire
","This movie will have you at the edge of your seat from the moment of the kidnapping until the very end. Liam Neeson plays a retired CIA agent who is trying to build his relationship with his daughter who he absolutely adores but due to his job could hardly ever be there for her. He reluctantly lets his 17 year old daughter go to Paris with a friend and they get kidnapped by a well organized group of Albanians who use them in slave trades. From the moment the abduction takes place, the action becomes nonstop and you wont find time to get your eyes off of the screen. The tension and suspense just builds on up from that point on. This movie follows the same formula Man on Fire did with Liam Neeson taking the place of Denzel Washington. He makes sure no man involved in the kidnapping goes unpunished thanks to his Jason Bourne like skills. Speaking of Bourne, the editing scenes are just as great. Liam Neeson (Oscar winner for Shindlers List) is back in form. His serenity and calmness in the whole situation assures the audience he is going to get his daughter back. Screenwriter Luc Besson (who also directed and wrote the cult movie Leon The Professional) was one of the reasons I wanted to see this movie. He did not disappoint me. So far one of the top 5 movies I've seen in 2008."

As simple as a teenage girl getting kidnapped and her skillfull former agent father seeks for her freedom and revenge on the people who took her. This movie excells in so many levels, Liam Neeson is so badass in every scene that even the viewer gets intimidated, the plot is simple yet good enough to keep you focused, action is pretty nice and deserves the recognition and the whole movie is a perfect example of how a simple revenge story can get so iconic. Neeson's performance is clearly one to remember, badasss, emotional, intimidating and fearless, he gets more and more badass everytime he appears on screen. My only one issue that appears due to my personal taste, I really don't like the shakey cam, it's not the main way of shooting the fight scenes but it's sometimes pretty annoying to be honest.

"gofloatbali","5","0","0","26 June 2020"," Half decent action with no suspense, overrated
","Surprisingly poor for a movie which got a lot of praise, and started a whole series.<br/><br/>I don't consider myself that hard to please when it comes to rating an action-movie. I am forgiving as long as the movie gives me the thrills I seek in that genre. But Taken just turned me of in stead of on, and I really dont get why its relatively highly rated. The consensus is that Taken 2 and 3 couldnt live up to the first and dont have its charm. But what is the charm?<br/><br/>Let me try to explain. First I look what the movie is trying to be. Taken goes for dead on serious. No comedy. The action is over the top in the sense that it is not realistic, but it tries to be grounded. Liam Neeson is no Jason Statham, so to speak.
Taken has very little depth and also doesnt seem to want to be a documentary on sex slavery. Yes it paints a rough picture on how this trafficking works, but very rough.
This all kind of leaves me clueless of what the movie wants to be. Its serious but not realistic.. A movie that creates a bassass new action-star? But the movie does spent a lot of time on its thin plot. The detective-work is without much imagination, and Neeson (an actor I do like) has a very one dimensional somewhat boring character. Then I believe the movie is mainly praised because of its fighting- action, but I mainly miss overview during the fight-scenes and when they repeat him shooting from floor-hight I really wonder if they already had run out of ideas. The action is entertaining enough but by no means outstanding.<br/><br/>Taken has very little suspense as our hero is a superdude and has no flaws or vulnerability as a hero. The villains all seem weak compared to him. Also they seem all the same.
Yes, as father he is flawed, but I see almost no point in that plotline, especially cause they dont work it out. It just creates a well earned hug in the end and thats about it.
He also barely seems flawed compared to the very unlikable mother and her husband.<br/><br/>Then on top of all I find the acting largely mediocre. Neeson is by far the best actor in it, but the script gives him so little to work with. The daughter had almost no personality at all. A young naive girl. Thats about it.<br/><br/>The charm must be a kinda cute father that saves his daughter by killing a countless amount of guys.<br/><br/>I give the movie a 5.5 out of 10. Some likable moments and half-decent action makes it almost an acceptable 6."

Neeson plays Brian Mills, an ex-Militia man, who's daughter Kimmie, Maggie Grâce, is abducted along with her friend Amanda, as they arrive in Germany to follow a band. Things go bad and Mills goes after his daughter, killing anyone who gets in his way!

","""Taken"" (2008) is an intense action movie starring Liam Neeson, and the first installment in the Taken franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>Taken's plot revolves around trafficking and, unsurprisingly, abduction. Other sensitive topics are also brought up, such as prostitution. All in all, it creates a very dark and sometimes disturbing tone, which some viewers can find repulsive. Nevertheless, Taken never exploits said subjects deeper than what's necessary. Although intense, it is manageable.<br/><br/>Taken is also a very violent film. The fight scenes, thanks to the contrasts from the relatively soft beginning and family interactions, can have a very shocking and brutal approach. Blood is present, but never in excess.<br/><br/>There are two sequels to this movie, which continues the established premises but doesn't contribute much more than additional runtime. One could skip them and not miss out on much, however, if you find yourself a die-hard fan of Taken, it could be of interest to at least watch the second installment and take it from there.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a rock solid 8/10.

","Watched it for the 3 time in the 10 years (hard to believe it has been that long!) that it's been out. It really does hold up as a pure action movie. If you're looking for deep meaning or subverting your expectations, look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Casting Neeson in this role must have been an odd choice at the time. I mean, Oskar Schindler is going to open a can of whoop ass on a bunch Euros? But, I can't imagine the phone conversation that gets the plot rolling played by any of the more usual suspects cast in action roles. <br/><br/>The pacing is great. The action sequences are pretty standard fare in the post-Bourne era. Revenge/rescue is a tried and true plot for an action movie. Paris is a visually interesting backdrop and the bad guys have no redeeming qualities so there is no need to feel guilty when they routinely get turned into pulp.<br/><br/>Also, if you have a teen daughter, by all means watch it with her. Not to scare her about going to Europe, but more to remind her to listen to dad's wisdom (and to scare her about strangers when going to Europe)."

","Taken (2008) is a pretty entertaining action film that features good acting all around. If I had to sum up the basis of this movie in one sentence, that would be it. It's not the best action film I've seen, it's just pretty good. The movie has been overrated, a 7.8 rating is just too high for this one. It's not worthy of a 7.8 IMDb rating. Yes, Liam Neeson is good in the starring role, even if some of his acting is a little cheesy at times. Maggie Grace is fine, I honestly wasn't impressed by her performance, but I didn't think she was bad. And the rest of the cast is fine too. The action is done very well if that's what you're looking for. The movie will keep your attention 80% of the time. I really don't know why the movie has been loved to the point it has been, I just see it as another pretty good action movie, to be honest it's not all that different from the other action movies that regularly come out. I do recommend the film if you like action, if you'd like something deeper than a regular action movie, then I would say maybe keep looking. I enjoyed it a fair amount, but I wouldn't be all too hyped to watch it again. 7/10."

","A father who is on the phone with his daughter when she gets kidnapped? Why not ? But when the father is a former agent of the American secret services played by a Liam Neeson without pity, close to everything to find his daughter, it becomes interesting! Throughout the film, we focus on Bryan during his fight against Albanian pimps, adhere to his fight, his unorthodox methods, even if he puts all Paris to sack. We are with him in his fight and we follow him in scenes of actions well done, not too disproportionate, just what it takes. One of the reproaches I would make to this film is that it is a little too short for my taste, I would probably have liked a few tens of minutes more. This film deserves a 8/10!

","That action hero image that Liam Neeson has cultivated over the last ten-odd years is a well-earned one. And as far as I'm concerned, he did it without throwing a punch. ""Taken"" features a scene - you already know the one - in which Neeson calmly lays out the consequences to his daughter's kidnappers: <br/><br/>(Note: read these words in his deep gravelly voice) <br/><br/>""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."" <br/><br/>If it were me on the other end of that phone, I'd know damn well I'm headed for a gruesome end. And ""Taken"" pretty much fulfills that promise. Neeson moves from one set of bad guys to the next, methodically laying waste to their scumbag ranks. It's a workmanlike campaign of torture and death. What's disappointing is that the action scenes are a dizzying cut-to-ribbons affair, a stark reminder that this is really your typical Luc Besson eurotrash. It's got that crucial emotional element and a perfectly cast lead actor, but it's never as good as that one phone call.<br/><br/>6/10"

","When his daughter is kidnapped abroad, an ex-CIA agent goes to extreme lengths to locate her in this fast-paced, non-stop thrill ride whose box office success turned Liam Neeson into an action star. Neeson is indeed very good, conveying heartfelt passion and longing for his child, and much of the film's success is due to his commanding performance. The screenplay is certainly less spectacular, full of so many absurd improbabilities and timing coincidences that any sense of realism soon evaporates. There is also something quite ham-fisted in how Neeson spends the entire first twenty minutes worrying that something will happen to his daughter overseas. At first, he seems paranoid, but then the film confirms his every suspicion, in turn implying that all foreign places are really lurking with danger. Clunky and xenophobic as all this is though, even more vexing is the body count. With many men killed in Neeson's quest, it is hard not to question whether the end justifies the means. Neeson even kills three or four men purely out of anger. If they were standing in his way, it might be one thing, but Neeson's strategy of obtaining information, then mercilessly killing, comes off as a major character flaw that the filmmakers sadly have little interest in exploring. Deeply flawed as the film may be, it is still enormously entertaining - even upon second viewing when one knows exactly what to expect. The action scenes are very well spliced together and a sense of danger sublimely lingers in the air throughout. As invincible as Neeson seems, he also always seems utterly vulnerable, and the fact that he is much too old for the role actually works to his advantage."

","I love this movie. I've seen it already a couple times, and I've always loved it. This time was no exception. <br/><br/>The plot of Taken is exactly what you'd expect from a movie with that title: It's about someone who gets taken. In this case, a man's daughter, and the man, Brian, goes after her. It's paced very well, and all the reasons for coming to certain conclusions aren't implied (like in other movies I've seen like this) but instead are obvious and explained. Everything has a reason for happening, and it remains relatively simple throughout. <br/><br/>The characters are pretty good. They aren't horribly well-developed or anything, but you know them pretty well by the end. <br/><br/>Taken is super fun to watch. The action scenes are great, a lot better than others that I've seen. They aren't expertly choreographed or unrealistic or anything. Brian uses quite simple movements to attack his enemies, while still maintaining a quite fluent and epic battle to watch. It adds to the realism of the fight while not being boring to watch. Oftentimes the simpleness of his moves are quite humorous in how dispassionate and relentless they (and he) can be. <br/><br/>Something that I noticed particularly about this movie as opposed to other movies is that Brian's character is pretty open about his old job. All these movies about ex-hit men or ex-spies all feel the same: The guy is running from his past but something comes up and he has to take action. In Taken, Brian still hangs out with his friends from his old job, and it's never completely stated what he did for a living exactly. It leaves that part up to the audience. Most characters let on that they also knew what he was doing for work, which once again, isn't the norm in these kinds of movies typically. <br/><br/>Overall Taken is fantastic. The plot is great, the characters are good, the action if great, and it's original. It stands as one of the best action movies out there, and it's definitely different from others while still being loads of fun. In the end I'd certainly recommend this movie to just about anyone looking for a good time at the movies."

Taken truly makes you reconsider letting your loved ones travel alone in the world. All I could think of while watching this movie was ""If that was my daughter I would have zero clue on how to get her back!"" I actually felt terrible for all those women who got tortured, drugged and raped. Really makes you think how many girls have been separated from their family and loved ones in reality. The amount of sad emotions and pain they would feel is just heart breaking. Taken really makes you feel the emotional pain and anger actual families in these circumstances encounter.

The movie is fun to watch, moves at a quick pace and because the bad guys are so bad (sex trade kidnappers) you don't feel much remorse when they get knocked out, maimed, shot, stabbed, electrocuted, dumped overboard, or just plain killed.<br/><br/>Neeson plays an ex CIA agent who turns Paris upside down after his teenage daughter is abducted by members of a sex trade gang. Ruthless in his quest, he employs his ""very particular set of skills"" in tracking her down and its pretty awesome.<br/><br/>On the negative side Maggie Grace is a bit too old to play the 15 year old party dress wearing, boppy teenager and initially 'Bryan' seemed way too (certifiably) obsessed with her wellbeing. The acting is solid though Grace definitely does her bit to act underage and Neeson is intense throughout along with some well choreographed fight scenes, car chases, shootouts, torture sequences etc. Its a classic. 12/28/15"

","The movie Taken is about a man, Brian Mills, who is retired from the Central Intelligence Agency and did so in order to spend more time with his daughter. Shortly into the movie Bryan's daughter, Kim, travels to Paris where she is abducted by a rich and powerful group who is discovered to be known for its sex trafficking operations. The theme of the movie is pretty obvious but the directors do a good job with the progression of the film to make you feel as if there is a slim chance the Brian may not make it in time to save Kim. The films theme is about Brian, who has a special background in the CIA who is trying to get away from the fast and dangerous life that his job entailed but found himself in an unfortunate situation which does not allow that to happen. A film with a similar theme is Live Free or Die Hard which is a part of the Die Hard series. Brian's nemesis seems as if it is incapable of defeat and is always one step ahead. However, Brian will do whatever it takes to accomplish the mission. The audience is drawn close to the Brian by using characteristics that go hand in hand with the ideal father figure. Characteristics such as a loving and gentle man who has the dangerous tenacity that any man would envy. The kidnapping of his daughter Kim triggered a chain of events that releases Brian's unrelenting force that is seemingly unstoppable no matter what comes his way.<br/><br/>The angle and lighting of the phone call scene in combination with the intensity of Brian's voice gives you goose bumps. The camera focuses on Brian's facial features which is draped in a sort of dark setting. This gives you the feeling that Brian is deep in thought and true to every word he speaks. He answers the phone call sitting on the bed but as soon as he puts the phone to his ear he begins to stand up. When Brian stands up it give you the feeling that he is ready to take action against the person on the other side of the phone. The camera subtly zooms in on Brian's face to give you an intimate moment with Brian and the perpetrators. A moment that makes you want to join forces and find Kim. When it comes to a child in distress the only thing that will stop Brian would be death, however, death itself will have a tough match against a man on fire."

","Taken(2008) Taken, directed by Pierre Morel, was released in 2008, and emphasizes Liam Neeson's fantastic action and great thrills as Morel already showed in prior movies like 'District 13' and 'Transporter'. Unlike other action movies, Taken also contains parental love which is actually the starting point of the action.<br/><br/>The film, is set in France, where Kim(Maggie Grace) and her friend are traveling. The action begins when Kim is kidnapped by gangsters. Before being kidnapped, she makes a phone call to her father, Bryan(Liam Neeson) who is a former secret agent. When the gangsters find Kim calling her father, one of them takes her phone. Bryan threatens the gangsters to set his daughter free, but they ignore him and just say 'good luck' to him. Based on this phone call, he tries to find them according to the specific tattoos which Kim describes. Finally, he finds the gangsters and tries to catch the man who kidnapped his daughter, but the more clues he gets about where Kim is, the more he gets in trouble.<br/><br/>It's very remarkable that the director portrays Bryan as a ""rounded character"". To be more specific, some scenes in which he kills gangsters portray him as a cruel man, but some scenes which are related to his daughter portray him as an ordinary father. Of course, considering the genre of this movie, the best aspect of Bryan's appeal is his wonderful action which is shown when he fights with gangsters.<br/><br/>Taken is full of fantastic action that will appeal to anyone who likes action and thrills. Also, it may help young people understand their parents' infinite love by seeing Liam Neeson's devotion to his daughter. Therefore Taken is absolutely worth watching and anyone who watches this movie won't be able to take their eyes off the screen until the movie ends."
"dfa120374","7","0","0","3 November 2015"," An Excellent Action/Thriller
","Taken may have been released back in 2008, but to be honest it is still one of the best Action/Thrillers that's been released within the last 20 years, and the part of Bryan Mills is played superbly by Liam Neeson. This isn't an over-the-top Action/Thriller; it's not a cheesy Action/Thriller; it's also not an Action/Thriller that lacks in the story department either as so many can - and usually - do. Nope, Taken is one of the more rarer Action/Thrillers that delivers a decent story along with plenty of tense, high-paced action.<br/><br/>Both the story and film start out decently enough, and continues at a steady enough pace instead of diving straight in with no backstory to anything. It gradually builds as it goes on and only increases in tension & pace from the moment that Mills' daughter is kidnapped. The build up to this moment alone was excellent...the suspense, the way the scene was edited together, and of course the ""I will find you"" speech delivered perfectly by Neeson. All of that doesn't just stop at that scene, though, as the rest of the movie is pieced together fantastically as the action & intensity both increase.<br/><br/>Neeson is perfect in the role as Bryan Mills and it's like it was made for him. This obviously isn't the 1st action film he's done, but don't think he's played this type of role very often - if at all - but he slot right into it with no problems. I learned that Jeff Bridges was offered the part before Neeson. No offence to Bridges, but I can't really picture him playing this kind of role and thankfully he dropped out paving the way for Neeson. Even though she's not in it all that much, Famke Janssen was good also and she has this knack for playing annoying women so perfectly, which is how I found Lenore to be in Taken...annoying and very naive, especially when it came to her daughter. The evil side of me wishes Mills would have said ""I told you"" to Lenore at the end.<br/><br/>Taken is definitely a film that should be on everyone's ""must see"" list."

","I Will Find You (8/10) Pierre Morel's action packed thriller, Taken, seemed to be quite the attention grabber for a broad audience. You will see some familiar faces on the screen such as Liam Neeson playing the father and former government agent (Bryan), Famke Janssen as the mother (Lenor), and Maggie Grace playing the innocent teenage daughter (Kim). Kim's trip will give you a different outlook on France and some of the problems in the world that are so easily overlooked. Taken doesn't seem to be the most believable scenario, but informs the audience of the arising issue with human trafficking and the societal normalization of prostitution. It will have you sitting on the edge of your seat continuing to wonder what is in store for you next. Liam Neeson, (Bryan) the father of a teenage girl Maggie Grace (Kim), is a retired government agent. He remains persistent while struggling to regain presence in his daughter's life. While on a trip in Paris with her best friend, Kim is kidnapped and held for the pleasure of the slave traffickers. With the only information Bryan has from his daughter's short phone call before getting ""taken,"" he has less than four days to track his daughter down in Europe and is willing to demolish anyone or anything that gets in his way. In this film you will experience Liam Neeson tearing Europe apart in horrific search of his daughter. Liam Neeson's character will grab your attention and hold it tight from start to finish. The acting in this film is not only entertaining and respected, but the actors truly portray their character while giving you a feel of what it would be like to be in their shoes. With the little acting Maggie Grace (Kim) had in the movie, she did well playing the part of a seventeen year old who seemed to know more than everyone. While being auctioned off to the slave trafficking buyers Kim shows to be helpless, hopeless, and scared but yet becomes more aware of her horrible situation. While experiencing the unbearable time, Kim becomes more mature and advanced with the world around her. In this action thriller, there are many fast moving scenes. Even though they keep you biting your nails, they are at times hard to follow and very easy to become lost in. With it being an action packed movie, they should have aimed for better camera movement and viewing. In the modern apartment, during the kidnapping scene it becomes quite hard to follow as the editing and film choices were not the best. While the action is never boring or tiring, it is just sometimes hard to view, solely because of the editing decisions and capturing of scenes. Although full of excitement, it might also make you nauseous with the fast camera movements, poor editing, and quick scene changes. Morel brings a captivating sensation upon his viewers while watching this film. You will leave with the opinion of a consistent dialogue, a great choice of characters, and a riveting yet distinctive storyline. This film deserves great credit for delivering the misinterpreted facts and horror about sex trafficking to the audience. Not only does Pierre Morel leave you and everyone else feeling accomplished, he keeps your thoughts in mind on every action scene. I believe everyone should go out and see this movie, if anything to become more educated on these bigger issues. As Liam Neeson would say, ""Good luck"" to everyone. This movie will be tough to beat."

""Taken"" being his most bad-ass role involves him killing over forty evil sex-traffickers who kidnap his daughter in Paris. Sex- traffickers were the perfect villains to tackle due to having an international relations type of plot with Neeson's character traveling all over. Fight after fight and shot after shot, Neeson delivers menacing facial expressions towards his enemies while constantly knocking down bad guys in his post CIA career. Director Pierre Morel gets the fact that Americans like big movie stars taking down bad guys without making us suffer through some father-daughter sap. Morel blends a mega human rights issue that's handled with awesome action, punishing those cruel men who fill his screen. Neeson, having a blast, gives a ton of energy into his fun role.

","Liam Neeson is no stranger to thrillers and Pierre Morel's 'Taken' was certainly one of those which highlighted Neeson's strength in the genre.<br/><br/>The action is relentless and thoroughly engaging however with a lesser actor in Neeson's shoes, 'Taken' would have struggled massively. In fact, the main reason 'Taken' is a good watch is due to the strength Neeson has as the leading character - the action just cements the films solidity. <br/><br/>When Neeson's on screen daughter Maggie Grace is kidnapped by sex traffickers, he is pushed to his limits in order to even have a sniff of finding his child. <br/><br/>It's many flaws come with a thin plot line, no twists of relevance, various characters poorly fleshed out characters who are bland without much personality and a seemingly rushed ending after the crew appear to run out of script ideas.<br/><br/>However, for Neeson's strong commanding performance and an exhilarating feature length roller-coaster action frenzy, you can't go far wrong.<br/><br/>Rental from the local DVD shop. <br/><br/>Popcorn from Home Bargains.<br/><br/>Job's a good 'n as us more common British say."

Mills comes across as an ordinary, likable joe who likes to barbecue in the backyard with his pals, except that he also harbors lethal ninja reflexes from his former job as a federal agent with a murky resume.<br/><br/>He's also been a bit abused by the system, having undergone a divorce and having to feebly tolerate the endless whips and scorn of his conniving, superficial ex-wife and constant financial humiliation before the disgustingly rich sockpuppet who replaced him, as husband to his wife and as guardian of his daughter. But they are living the high life now, and Mills is left behind like an obsolete relic, a drag on the party.<br/><br/>But then, due largely in part to everyone's failure to listen to his better sense of the world, Mills' daughter is taken. She is snatched away into oblivion by dark spirits thousands of miles away and an ocean apart. So just how far does a father's love go? <br/><br/>It all sounds a bit hackneyed, even dated, but nevertheless the movie rides Neeson's performance as the scrappy, determined, and shockingly brutal hunter-tracker who charges through all obstacles, human, physical, societal, or logical, to rescue his daughter. In spite of having been featured prominently in a number of action movies, Neeson looks like a doting daddy, not a tough-guy assassin and I think that is why these types of roles for him result in such appealing, entertaining movies.<br/><br/>Taken is a fun, action-packed thriller in which Miller efficiently delivers just dessert to all of the nasty fiends scuttling along the supply line leading to his daughter. It's a bit of a throwback to older revenge and justice fantasies, in which White, middle-class westerners lash out at swarthy ethnic people who are out to exploit and wring dry western civilization. I can see why some would feel that the movie cultivates fear, distrust and xenophobia; I'm actually a bit impressed with how boldly the movie, like Miller, dives headfirst into these thorny situations."

","Taken is a cult classic with a huge following, and all this is due to its portrayal of a former CIA who was ready to do anything to get back his kidnapped daughter. The movie's intense following is due to its violent nature portrayed by Liam Neeson, as he was a James Bond, Jason Borne and Rambo all rolled up into one chasing down a group of Armenians and making them pay dearly for even thinking about taking his daughter.<br/><br/>The film was so well received by audience that it raked in a high 200 million dollars from its 25 million dollars production cost, Luc Besson was the man behind the direction and the writing of this cult classic and he was called back to come make the sequel Taken 2, which was released in 2012.<br/><br/>The movie is about Ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), whose daughter gets kidnapped when she travels to Paris to follow U2 during their European tour. With only a picture of his daughter at the airport, the voice of the man who took her, Bryan is racing against time to save his daughter before she is shipped out of the country and not seen again.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson's performance in this movie is what is captivating; his character's ability to keep calm and think his way through any situation is what makes Bryan Mills the wrong guy to mess with (elements of Jason Borne), he used every known way alive to track down these guys, even shooting a friend's wife just to get the man to talk. He placed himself in danger numerous times but was able to find a way out at all times making him Bond and Rambo.<br/><br/>At the end of this movie, you will be queuing up for seconds. My favourite action scene is when Bryan corned Peter (the man who leads the kidnappers to his daughter) in a taxi in Paris and starts to punch his ribs in, giving him details of how his ribs and lungs may not survive another punch if Peter doesn't give him all the information he wants to know. Here is a DVD that i couldn't help but owning.<br/><br/>Mind you Taken 2 was just same same, with him and wife taken now and he just having to be Bryan and he breaks free tracks down the guys again and messes them up. Taken 2 is just a speck in the dark compared to this grand master.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","In this France thriller, Liam Neeson plays a retired CIA agent who's daughter gets kidnapped into prostitution in Paris, causing him to take action and locate his daughter by any means, (and that means killing anybody who steps in his path).<br/><br/>He trained Batman, changed the lives of 2000 Jews, and fought off a pack of wolves, now he's back and more bad-ass than ever. Despite his old age, he still manages to impress us to no end.<br/><br/>I like to compare this film to Bourne, except while Bourne is always on the defensive, Neeson in this is on the full on offense. No mercy in this film, everybody who doesn't help him locate his daughter gets it, no joke. It's extremely fast paced and doesn't fool around. Gets right down to business. No rush either, just simply fast filmed. Fast editing, fast dialog, and fast and awesome action scenes. Most of the film consists of Liam Neeson killing, interrogating, or chasing someone. The villains change from person to person, as he simply follows around his daughter's kidnappers.<br/><br/>Although a truly simple story, it still stays bright with the smartness of the character, and his amazing skills. But regardless, it isn't very complex, like Bourne is. But it really didn't need to. Why be needlessly complex just to waste pointless time and money. It's as simple as it gets. Plus a few parts are really intense, making it feel complex.<br/><br/>If I had to argue one thing, it'd be that it was a little anti- climactic. Kills everybody and rescues the daughter, that's it. Yes, he does get captured, but escapes immediately. Then the daughter returns and is like, ""bye dad, thanks for saving my life"", (Not what she really says, but basically). Even though that didn't bother me too much, it was just something I noticed. Other than that, simply brilliant. No complicated subplots or characters, doesn't ever drag, just the plot, the character, and his mission, that's all. You will not find another film that does that, I assure you. Definitely worth the watch! Just be careful with the sequel, I heard it isn't as good."
"josh-thawley","7","0","0","20 June 2012"," Not the most creative film out there, but definitely worth a watch.
","There seems to be a trend in recent years for elderly action stars to revisit characters from their past; be it the upcoming ""Dine Hard"" (where a geriatric Bruce Willis is living a care-free life in a care- free care home, spoon fed all his meals. Until he realises generic terrorists are purposefully sabotaging Meals on Wheels) or ""Indiana and the Quest for the Adult Nappies"" (where Harrison Ford realises that having an irritating Shia LaBeouf as your son isn't great when it comes to choosing a care home).<br/><br/>Anyway, I digress. Taken turns this trope on its head, in having the aged Liam Neeson only joining the action genre in his old age. Taken also manages to avoid all of the clichéd plots that other action movies spew out, such as an elite special forces soldier's daughter being kidnapped and him going on an international rip-roaring revenge rampage. Oh wait, that's the entire plot. When his daughter is kidnapped in France, by Eastern European sex traffickers, Neeson heads to Paris to f**k sh*t up for an hour and a half. Of course, this being an American film, the Big Bad must ultimately be brown, so it's lucky Neeson's (I'm making no attempt to pretend I actually know his character's name) daughter is being bought by a Saudi Sheik.<br/><br/>Whilst the plot is terrible and a soggy retread of Die Hard and other classic action films, Taken does provide some amazing action sequences and harrowing torture scenes. Neeson excels, managing to be far better than the script should allow him to be.<br/><br/>Whilst not exactly an Oscar winner, Taken manages to be great in its own right, and it's quotability and enjoyment factor lead to what has shown itself to be a cult classic, and a great piece of pulp fiction."

","I think it's safe to say the only reason this film is good is because of Liam Neeson. The guy really plays the role fantastically, he's so freaking AWESOME!! However, if it wasn't for Sir Neeson, it would be an abomination. I have to say, Maggie Grace is probably one of the worst actors I have ever seen. She always plays this annoying, unlikeable in every film I've seen her in. And she's the worst character in Lost! Every actor including Maggie, just make the whole thing kinda cheesy... Then Neeson owns everyone. My only criticism is that they should've made the other characters more likable, especially Maggie, I didn't care about her at all to be honest."

","Taken has surprised me in many different levels. It's fast paced, exciting, and in general just a very well-told story. I gave it an eight because it managed to keep me glued to the screen throughout the whole time. <br/><br/>If you are looking for one of those movies where there is always something going on, and no moments of utter boredom, the this is for you.<br/><br/>However, I do feel obliged to admit that if I were looking for a realistic movie, this would not be it. Perhaps because it is rather short, sometimes it seems as if there is too much (!) going on. Plus, the main character (whose role was beautifully played) takes on a mission to single-handedly get her daughter back from a bunch of mafiosi in Paris. Like I said, not the most realistic movie out there.<br/><br/>Neverthess, within its short running time, and within its genre, it's a very entertaining movie. It is definitely worth watching. It does not attempt to be what it cannot be, like so many movies out there do nowadays, with all their complex plots and overly thought-out characters. This is simply a very good MOVIE."

","This movie is the first movie that, while watching, I thought to myself ""Wow. This movie is really exciting."". The plot is actually pretty simple, which shows that you do not need to have a really complicated plot with multiple twists to make a great action movie.<br/><br/>Besides the execution of the movie, what stands out is that Liam Neeson's performance of Taken is absolutely amazing. The ruthlessness that comes only with having something so important ""taken"" away was really conveyed in the action.<br/><br/>SPOILERS My only gripe is that the ending may not have been as realistic as I expected. As much as I am a sucker for happy endings, it seems odd that he did not have to ""clean up"" or pay for what he did in Paris. <br/><br/>All in all, a great movie.

","I saw this movie at the stand of my DVD rental. I had nothing to do that night so, i decided to rent this movie just because Liam Neeson was in it. I heard nothing about this movie before so i had no expectations what-so-ever. I have to say: I was blown away with this movie. The brilliance of the direction kept my heart pounding, thirsty for more information about the development of the plot. The action sequences were beautifully made with some parts kinda hasty-made in editing, but it was something neglect- able because of the exquisite quality of the stunts. Liam Neeson managed, as always, to capture his role so tightly that you could tell that he was actually made for the certain part. And you actually KNEW that he would kill you by twisting his pinkie. Neeson is a great actor and always excels in what he does. Think of him as the opposite of Nick Cage.<br/><br/>All in all I give this movie a great 8/10. I loved the story, the acting was brilliant, the stunts were cool and it was a great production after all."
"jackharding89-1","8","0","0","12 April 2012"," Who's the daddy!?
","Tzvetan Todorov's model of narrative equilibrium and the action film go hand-in-hand. Harmony, disruption, restoration. Simple. Enter Taken; Director Pierre Morel kicks things off with some good old fashioned scene setting. Subtle, delicate and about as ordinary as a Nicholas Cage film. Oh, and we're also thrust onto the side of his protagonist in the most ostentatious of fashions: exiled Dad Bryan (Liam Neeson) buys his daughter a karaoke set, step dad whips out a dashing white pony. Top that. But as far as negative criticisms for Taken go, I'm spent. A mundane start and structure doesn't conceal the fact that this is a stunning, high-octane fuelled action film with a freehold on the fast and furious, the tense and intense. Second-best to Bourne, perhaps, but more than a match for those that rest and revel in the action/adventure genre. <br/><br/>Bryan may've been cast into the shade by a prancing pony but he's one hard b*stard. A worn, torn, tried and tested retiree trying to make up for those lost years taxed by trade. A trade that annulled a marriage, divided a three piece family suite and rid Mills of any domestic respect he may've had. His line of work? Protection. Prevention. 007 kinda stuff; he was a first-class covert infiltrator for the U.S Government. Highly- trained, highly-skilled, highly- dangerous. So I suppose it's Mr. B*stard to you, then. Neeson's adroit and wrinkled visage tells us all we need to know from the outset. He's been there. Done that. Got the t-shirt. But when a clan of wily, woman traffickers ""unexpectedly"" up and off with daddy's little girl in Paris, the pension gets the boot and we have ourselves a movie. And a pretty good one at that: a part chase, part rescue, part action; adventure, thrill and redemption movie with verve, vigour and viscera. Archetypal? Sure. Taken throws up nothing new, but it is one of the best of its overcooked kind: sometimes heavy, sometimes cruel. Gritty in places, stylish in others. Clever in areas, conservative in others. It's a very well made film fresh from the minds and eyes that bought us the superb French thriller, District 13.<br/><br/>Co-penned, then, by Luc Besson and directed by Pierre Morel, Taken draws numerous and sometimes obvious likings to the Jason Bourne franchise; guerrilla styled photography, breakneck editing, fast cars, fast hands, state of the art tech', superior covert opp' crushing skull after skull. Bourne didn't know who or what he was, though. Mills does: a pensioned off, ticked off CIA hard nut without the rust and with plenty of thrust (""I will find you, and I will kill you!"" ). For all its heart stopping scraps and tussles, takedowns, beatdowns, fist, gun and knife fights, Taken succeeds in mining our emotions and domestic qualms on an up-close and personal level. The empathy injection, although clichéd, works to the film's advantage. None of us could really relate to Bourne's mind state or predicament but with this- we kind of can. Whether it be as a father, mother, daughter or even tourist. Thus every grapple, pursuit, punch, shift, block, bullet, bob and weave has added intent and meaning. You'll be willing Neeson's Mills on through every horde of baddies as he plots and pummels his way to his daughter's aid. <br/><br/>It's Neeson who'll no doubt seize the plaudits, then. And why not. The acclaimed thesp' churns out yet another first-class performance as the determined, ageing action hero; proving once more that there's no role he cant take on without rendering both his own and convincing. Neeson's pin-sharp portrayal of Mills' means the character's not just his corny little girl's rock, he's ours too. The man's an exceptional actor. His Taken turn reiterates his kudos as one of the industry's finest.<br/><br/>As for the film itself? In terms of flat-out entertainment? It's the best since the Bourne Supremacy by a mile. Yes, I said Supremacy. Didn't go much on Ultimatum I'm afraid. But I'll leave that for another day. Anyway, Taken's energy, score and degree of grip factor are spot- on but it's in the cutting room where the film really excels. Sharp, swift, seamless: the action set-pieces are cut to near perfection: showing us just enough on occasion to evoke a grimace, gasp or sly snigger. Heads get slammed in car doors. Bones get crushed. Noses broken. Skulls fractured. Action film junkies: satisfied.<br/><br/>Taken is a solid all-round effort. Hardly flawless but all you could ever really ask for from a steely, high-concept adventure film."

","So the thing about Liam Neeson is he has a very special set of skills. One of them being acting, unfortunately he doesn't always choose the best movies. Well, maybe financially Taken was a good decision, but I think he could do better. Taken is the story of a man in pursuit of his daughter who has been kidnapped to be used as a sex slave. Liam Neeson plays the father, an ex-super secret blah blah blah that can kick any ones ass and take a beating without it really showing. As much as most people liked it I didn't see anything particularly remarkable in this film. Shaky action movie camera work and one liners don't always do it for me. Sure the movie had a certain amount of entertainment, unfortunately due to the lighting you can barely see any of it. Which may be for the best because I would have gotten tired of seeing Neeson using his ""special set of skills"" to slam Euro-thugs for two hours straight. To me this movie is nothing new, nothing innovative, and not well executed enough to make up for it's unoriginality."

","What actually blew my mind about this movie was the public reaction to it. Not only does it have a high IMDb rating but it seems to be the movie that people automatically link with Liam Neeson (at least according to the recent Graham Norton Show) which would all imply that this was a great movie. But not only was it bad, it was so bad that me and my mate started laughing at the absurdity of it about halfway through. It was not a complete waste of 90 mins though, reading all the reviews written by people who hated it did provide at least 30 mins of solid laughs. <br/><br/>I am happy enough to ignore the stupidity of the daughter in the way she gets kidnapped as it sets up the film but from the get go Liam Neeson's character was so wooden and robotic. Maybe it was the script, the directing or the acting but it only got worse as he cuts a path of destruction through Europe with a psychotic intent of getting his daughter back any way possible. By the end it's hard to pick who is the more evil, Liam Neeson or the ""villains"" who make a habit of sexually enslaving women. Or maybe the person who wrote the unbelievably bad and stereotyped script...<br/><br/>I want to give this the lowest rating possible, but in the context of a pure action movie it's above average and that's why I have compromised for a rating of 3. But please don't believe the hype. It is not a Bourne Identity or Casino Royale. Those movies had the action coupled with some depth backed up by some good acting and that is why they were great. This movie is lacking in everything but the action. 3 Stars."

","I really liked this movie. I must say I wasn't expecting too much of it.

Now I am really pleased to note how wrong I was.<br/><br/>Even though the aforesaid is the main engine of the film, it is framed in the context of trafficking in women, a very interesting and sad topic to watch. These kind of ""business"" is re-arising nowadays, specially in Europe, and this movie is a good way to involve those who are not aware of its reality. Everyone of us have either a daughter, a sister, a cousin -- unfortunately we have not Neeson's abilities, otherwise everything would be easier.<br/><br/>The movie is easy to watch, and has a constant thrilling atmosphere that keeps you with both eyes on the screen. It has some plot holes, I must say, but nothing so important, and nothing that can't be explained with the ""of course, he learned that while working as a spy/preventor"" argument.<br/><br/>Please, go see it, and if you don't like it contact me.

","Trailers are often very more intense than the real thing,no surprises here. But even while bearing this in mind, flicks can be disappointing, regardless of their IMDb rating.<br/><br/>For me, this certainly was the case with Taken. You watch Liam Neeson as the desperate former CIA-operative Bryan who is struggling with his divorce and an apparent custody issue that does not allow him to visit his daughter Kim in personal. His wife, played by Famke Janssen, is very reluctant to his approaches to get in touch with her, especially at her birthday which is celebrated at the mansion of the obviously more fortunate new husband of his ex-wife. Knowing his daughter aspires to become a singer, he buys her a karaoke machine, which she gratefully accepts, only to become even more enthusiastic as she finds out her stepfather bought her a horse.<br/><br/>Kim and her friend Amanda plan to go on a holiday to Paris on the pretext of wanting to watch all the culture up there. As she is still 17, she needs her father's written permission. Being aware of the dangers of being alone in Paris, Bryan is reluctant to gove his permission. His ex-wife puts pressure on him, as she believes he is overprotective of his daughter. Finally, he signs, but only under a few conditions, such as calling him after her arrival and letting him know when they've reached their apartment.<br/><br/>At the airport however, Bryan finds out his daughter's real plan is to follow U2's Vertigo tour through Europe. Once more, his ex-wife insists he should let her go, as many teens follow through such plans.<br/><br/>Of course, right after arrival, things go awry. Kim and Amanda meet a young man, Peter, who asks if they'd like to share a cab as it is less costly. He takes a few pictures from them and tells them there is a party that night. Also, he finds out about their whereabouts. Amanda is enthusiastic about the party, but Kim is reluctant. That same night, mobsters break into the apartment. Kim watches while Amanda is being kidnapped while on the phone with Bryan. Bryan immediately turns on tapping equipment. Kim's phone is grabbed by one of the mobsters. Bryan firmly explains that he has not enough money for any ransoms, but has a 'considerate set of skill built up during a lifetime career' and that he will 'find them and kill them' if they do not release her daughter. He's simply answered with ""Good luck"" from a voice with an obvious foreign accent.<br/><br/>Kim's stepfather provides certain assets, such as a business plane which allows Bryan to fly to France unseen. Bryan uses his former connections, but is warned as his rampage causes too many victims. Destined to find his daughter, Bryan ignores these warnings and finds himself in some pretty ugly places. The chase is on. And there you have your flick I found myself pretty much disappointed. The martial arts skills that Neeson shows are impressive, however, there are too many implausible events and characters. Neeson kills a lot of bad guys, but also wound and/or kills apparently innocent persons, which makes his character difficult to accept. The overly concerned and apparently sincere character he plays seems to have just too little to justify his actions other than being a missing girl's father. He turns into an unstoppable force, with a thin red line between good and evil as his crusade leaves a lot of question marks on his behavior. Produced by Luc Besson, I expected a well-crafted action thriller, and Besson delivers. However, on the other hand, it is only a few steps away from 'Commando' where it comes to plausibility."

I can't think of any complaints for this movie other than the fact that the plot was very, if not maybe a little too, quick. If you're unaware that they're gonna make an attempt at a sequel to this, yes they are. Which I don't really get how you could but we'll just have to wait and see. And one thing that Neeson did well was showing his normal and average suburban act but soon after seeing that side showed his darker and stronger side. As well as demonstrating some really cool fighting techniques that consist mainly of chops to the neck. But on the whole, Taken = great achievement in modern thrillers."

","By Maurice Jones <br/><br/>When it comes down to it, I don't have any serious care for a film like this as it's just pure entertainment and Liam Neeson as an action hero is understandably laughable. But based on the enjoyed reaction it got from people around me and not being entirely opposed to mindless contrived mainstream entertainment, I checked out 'Taken'.<br/><br/>In 'Taken' Liam Neeson plays an ex government protector who decides to retired in order to get closer to his teenage daughter who's mother remarried do to the fact of his constant absence in the past do to his job. The ex protector soon finds out that his daughter wants to go away to Paris for the summer, asking his permission the ex protector immediately says no and warns her of the dangers of a teenage going out to Paris as a tourist on a whim, due to his experience being a government officer protecting the president. He eventually lets his daughter go and low and behold something happens and his daughter is taken, just as he predicted. At this point the movie goes straight into a movie sequence that seems set for Liam Neeson to be an action hero, a well narrating action hero which is immediately laughable. As things get into gear, out-right fight scene after out-right fight scene comes and comes as Liam Neeson's character is in search for his daughter in Paris. Although ridiculous, it is interesting and empowering seeing Liam Neeson plow through villain after villain and become this Jean Claude Van-Damme-esque ex protector reusing his past fight techniques. Liam Neeson's character is relentless in any way possible to get his daughter back which keeps the movie exciting but implausible and this lasts to the bitter end. By the end you can't believe he went through all that but are humbled by the quick acting-ness of a father who loves his daughter and will do anything for her.<br/><br/>I liked 'Taken' for the excitement and the ridiculousness of Liam Neeson being an action hero, but realizing in the end why Liam Neeson did this film; as he is soft enough to play a believable caring father but also smart enough and quick enough to be a lean mean unstoppable killing machine."

If you let my daughter go now, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you. And I will kill you."" - Liam Neeson, Taken.<br/><br/>From that quote, you can see what Taken is. A fast-paced action thriller with some of the most obvious lines in the history of the genre. The entire experience is lightweight and mildly amusing. Its plot is pretty ordinary, yet the film's characters are mostly efficient. It centers around Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills, a semi-retired CIA operative who worked in the field for many years which has led him to be aware, overprotective, and almost constantly paranoid.<br/><br/>Victim to his protectiveness is his daughter, Kim (Grace). Kim is Bryan's daughter from his first marriage that didn't go so well because of his frequent absence since his CIA job is very demanding. Kim is a bright young girl who begs daddy for his signature so she can go to Paris with her girlfriend to look at the museums, aka U2 concerts. Reluctantly and after providing a plethora of conditions, Bryan signs the agreement and Kim is off to Paris. It's not long her and her friend are kidnapped by a group of Albanian thugs.<br/><br/>Before she is taken, she calls her father who hears just enough information to make the effortless flight over to Paris and to try and find her kidnappers. Of course, Bryan possesses an unprecedented amount of skills to conduct an operation of this magnitude. For God's sake get this man a compass, a map, and a ticket to Afghanistan so he can find Osama Bin Laden and take down another terrorist operation! The first half hour of the film was compelling, interesting, and on top of everything an action film should be on top of; character development, plot, and suspense. After about forty-five minutes or so, Taken then becomes a slightly incomprehensible beat-em-up action film for the least demanding. The camera moves quickly and the fast paced editing style seems like it can sometimes barely keep up with the madness that's unfolding.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film is somewhat interesting, but how it merited a PG-13 rating is mind-boggling to me. It's not graphic, per se, but the MPAA is notorious for overreacting to small little instances and subject matter. The fact that this film can speak about drug addiction, prostitution, trafficking, and boast the amount of language and violence as if it comes in a limitless quantity, all with a PG-13 rating further cements that if a film focuses primarily on violence, the MPAA will continue to be very lenient on it.<br/><br/>Something also must be said about Liam Neeson's performance. He possesses wit, style, pleasantness, stress, and anger all in a believable manner. The film is essentially a one man show with Neeson bringing as much life to the character, going beyond what has already been provided. The rest of the supporting cast is either rarely seen or killed off shortly after they make an appearance.<br/><br/>Taken is a fair action film, motivated by the recurring action film themes; fast paced, sometimes unbelievable blows to every part of the body and nonstop twists and turns of the camera. Neeson manages to lift the film off its feet in terms of giving an efficient performance, but the film feels generic and suffers from the sameness we are so used to in action films today. It's not bad but its aftertaste is an underwhelming one at best.<br/><br/>Starring: Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Leland Orser, Jon Gries, David Warshofsky, Katie Cassidy, Holly Valance, and Famke Janssen.

","I, personally, enjoyed this movie. Great action film which centers on a father's pursuit of his daughter who has been abducted by sex traffickers while on a trip to Paris.<br/><br/>However, although I enjoyed the movie, especially its acting and its pace, I didn't really see much that wasn't entirely new and inventive. I was thinking about being more of a modern version of the 1979 movie ""Hardcore"" being combined with the talents of Liam Neeson from Nolan's ""Batman"" movie. I didn't think this is a ""deep"" movie, but another of Luc Besson's action films, not unlike ""The Fifth Element,"" Leon,"" and his scripted ""Transporter"" movies (the first of which was directed by Morel). <br/><br/>Sidenote: I am a fan of Besson (hence the higher rating), so I am slightly biased in my rating here. <br/><br/>Many may find this movie just another run-of-the-mill action movie, but it showcases Neeson well, showing a rough, poised individual and a sweet, misunderstood father/ex- husband. <br/><br/>A great companion piece to ""Hardcore,"" if you want to cross analyze 2 movies for a paper.<br/><br/>8 of 10. ------ E."

","First, we can all identify a formula movie. Kids' movies, Lifetime Network movies, Man Cave DVD shelf movies. This is one of the latter. It's not long on intellect or plot development. But what it does, it does well. One subtle difference beyond the bad guys not being able to shoot straight and the bad guys being just ""waste'em and don't worry about bullets"" bad, is Neeson's character isn't necessarily good to a tee. He's not horrible, but there are times when he pushes into moral ambivalence territory.<br/><br/>It had a nice pace and got to its points and got them out of the way, without trying to stretch it into a movie trying to be more important than it is. The acting is fair to good, but it is so fast paced that there isn't a whole lot of time to care. Other than Neeson, no other character has more than twenty lines of dialog.<br/><br/>Don't know if it's a movie that needs to be on that Man Cave shelf, but is worth more than one viewing. I'm on the edge whether I'll get a copy or not. But I will watch it again. I'll have to wait and see if it is niggling me to watch again and again and deserves a spot next to Die Hard.<br/><br/>Spoilers - There are a few groaners which is why I'm on the edge like Neeson is a super bad ass for 3/4ths of the movie and somehow lets himself get conked on the head and taken himself. Also, when he is at the baddies' mercy, a couple of loose bolts help out nicely - we're a safety inspection away from having a short and unsatisfying conclusion.

Bryan Mills made Jason Bourne look like a kid.

He gets to know from his resources that he has only 96 hours before his daughter disappears completely. The only thing he relies on are his extraordinary combating skills and his inner belief that he will see his daughter again. Soon after his arrival in Paris, he resorts to involution and implacability in the process of locating his daughter. <br/><br/>An iniquitous action flick with brilliant camera-work and superb fight choreography.

What does matter though is that, within a maximum of 20 or 25 minutes of the movie's start, ALL HELL BREAKS LOOOOOOSE!<br/><br/>The mix this time includes the thrilling search for the kidnapped girl by the vengeful father with the shoot 'um up solution. If Death Wish remade The Count of Monte Cristo as urban merciless father, Commando put the one-man-army to it. Here he has a little of everything added to a touch of James Bond (An ex-secret agent, disguises, Europe streets, some gadgets..). And the outcome of that is fine action thriller.<br/><br/>The best about it is surely the succession of the story. The way that father gets back his daughter from scratch wins the whole movie. The worst about it is the editing and the violence.<br/><br/>The editing gives no chance for anything to get out the comics case. I only hated it at the end's fight where it was like being in a fast train and nothing is clearly seen, just noisiness all the way then a suddenly successful hero!<br/><br/>The matter of the lead as a killing machine bothered me. Not because we have a wonderful actor this time, since the movie is dead set on wonderful thrill and action scenes, not drama. But simply because 1) He's unbeatable, which means Boooring. 2) He even can't be hurt, as if he's wearing invisible body's armor! 3) He kills everybody in front of him, being Rambo in the City!<br/><br/>I feel happy for (Liam Nieson). In his late fifties and he's making hit action movies, all in Hollywood (Try to name 10 stars who still work in action movies nowadays while being above 55?!).<br/><br/>What I don't feel so happy about it; is being too fast and too furious. However I always ask myself, if the hero, in any action, killed numerous persons (35 as in here, or 236 as in Rambo 4 one year earlier), then how many persons the audience wants to kill to make the producers of that do so?! Apparently the feel of relief lately has become something increasingly harsh and bloody.

","Taken starts out in a modern, American town. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), a former Central Intelligence Agency agent, struggles to keep a close relationship with his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), who lives with his divorced wife (Famke Janssen) and her wealthy step-father (Xander Berkeley). When Kim requests his permission to fly to Paris with her 19-year-old friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy), Bryan reluctantly gives in, demanding that she calls when she arrives and every night before she sleeps. After neglecting to call when she arrives, she contacts him a few hours after arriving at the hotel. During the conversation, she observes men dressed in black kidnapping her friend at the opposite end of the building. When the kidnappers reach Kim, Bryan promises to find and kill them, and his quest to rescue his daughter begins. <br/><br/>Despite the amount of action, Taken explores three legitimate topics. First, it beautifully portrays a father's love for his daughter. Even though Bryan knows the improbability of recovering his daughter, he risks his life and freedom to find her. In spite of his age, he pushes his body to its absolute limits to find her, depriving himself of sleep and nourishment. Second, it demonstrates the immense impact of career on our lives. Bryan's long career with the C.I.A. provided him with deadly skills that were still second nature to him years after his retirement. Lastly, Taken points out the heartbreaking issue of human trafficking.<br/><br/>Since it came out, Taken assumed its place among my top favorite movies. Compared to testosterone-drenched movies like The Expendables (2010), the violence in Taken has reason and intellect behind it. My favorite aspect is the analytical mindset of Bryan. Throughout Taken, viewers witness Bryan demonstrate superior tracking skills as he pieces together Kim's kidnapping. In one of my favorite scenes, he uses an unconscious hostage to camouflage himself among the bodies when reinforcements arrive, proving his uncanny ability to think clearly in all situations. Any time I desire intelligent action with a touching storyline, I take Taken into consideration."

I am a Liam Neeson fan (even ""Next of Kin,"" which is a sad sad movie), so I was happy to see him in this movie. The plot? Easy to follow and easy to be excited. There are plenty of twists and turns and not as many red herrings as I thought there would be. Red herrings? You know, where the director throws in a possible good guy that becomes the bad guy, or the bad guy that winds up being the good guy, or some other silly plot device.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a former Special Forces operative who now ekes out an existence providing private security to special events and people. His estranged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) wants to take an around the world trip with her best friend, but Bryan has reservations. These prove to be valid when Kim is kidnapped by an unidentified gang, and he hears it happen over the phone. He then begins a desperate trek around Paris trying to find out who the gang are, what they want and where his daughter is before it's too late.<br/><br/>This short and sweet little action film seems to be trying to re-write the conventions for the genre. To wit Neeson's father figure, remaining impeccably calm as he hears his daughter being kidnapped over the phone, telling her to hide (even though she gets taken anyway!) and then telling the kidnappers even more calmly '...if it's money you want, I don't have it. What I do have is a set of skills I have acquired over many years, skills which make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let her go now, this'll be the end of it. I will not hunt you. But if you don't, I will hunt you, I will find you and I will kill you', as you do. With 'good luck' as his reply, he has all the ammunition he needs to set off on his quest to find his off spring and punish her assailants. Neeson suits the action hero role perfectly, and brings that slight bit more gusto and dynamism to what is essentially a straight to DVD action film on the big screen, while director Pierre Morrel uses his home city effectively as the backdrop for the agoraphobic angst the desperate but clear headed father must be feeling as he prowls through such a big place for his most loved one.<br/><br/>It's generic, it's predictable, it's ridiculous, but it's just enough fun to make it an above average action film. ***"

","Okay...1st of all, this is an Action movie, no ifs ands or buts. So given that, you have to ask: Is the action awesome, are the plot holes bearable, are the bad guys bad enough and is the good guy kick-ass enough. The answer to most of these questions is YES! <br/><br/>Liam Neeson plays an ex-cia/super spy, who's sacrificed his family for his career. After retiring all he wants to do is be with his daughter who has just turned 17. She however wants to travel Europe. Coincidently of course, his daughter gets kidnapped by human traffickers the first day which sets Neeson on a gun busting daughter hunt all over Paris. <br/><br/>Some people might think this film is a bit too racist but I think it evens out the blame of human trafficking evenly among Westerners and non-westerners. The soft side of the film is a bit cheesy but doesn't go to the point where it makes the film unbearable, thankfully. <br/><br/>This film is badass! If you don't like action films then don't watch it, but as far as action films go, this is definitely one of the best in awhile. I think Die Hard 4 (Live Free or Die Hard) is very neck and neck with this film, so if you liked that movie you'll probably like this one. Except there's not really explosions in Taken but there's definitely plenty of bullet holes. <br/><br/>Side Note: I feel bad Famke Janssen has to do these roles where she's the broken/cranky/snarky woman in a bad marriage.

Another original aspect of the movie is when a couple of kidnapped victims (including the one played by Maggie Grace) are being ""sold"". I also didn't find the kidnappers to be especially evil, but that doesn't detract from how good the movie is.

Imagine if there was a film where 'Americans' was constantly used to refer to pedophiles?? Kazakhstan got off lightly with Borat!<br/><br/>Otherwise it's a simple, adrenaline fueled/ing throat punching, bottle brandishing rampage.

","How far would you go to save someone you loved? Would you fly to another country? Would you risk starting international warfare in order to get answers? Would you search whorehouse after whorehouse? Would you single handedly take down at least eight armed men with no weapon of your own? If you answered no to any of these questions, then you are obviously not Liam Neeson. But that's OK because in Taken, Liam Neeson borders on absolute sociopath. He plays Bryan Mills, an ex-spy and divorcée with a seventeen year old daughter named Kim. When Kim travels to France with a friend, Bryan takes every precaution to make sure her trip is safe. But it isn't good enough because Kim and her friend are kidnapped upon their arrival and subsequently sold to slavery in prostitution. This sets off a chain of events fueled by Bryan's rage and his frightening bloodlust for revenge. He utilizes all of his skills from his past profession to track down his daughter's kidnappers and enact his violent revenge on all of them before he gets his daughter back.<br/><br/>The highlight of this film is undoubtedly Liam Neeson. He plays his role to perfection, or at least as perfect as this character can get. Don't get me wrong, he's a very fun character but not as human as you would think. He's fueled by revenge and incessant determination to get his daughter back, but he does it all with a cold and robotic tone. I would much rather see this personality than one where he breaks down and cries every ten minutes though. And it really is fun to watch him go through all the brutal steps to track down his daughter. The man never misses a beat while on the hunt or in the heat of battle. The action of the film is executed very well and it is downright awesome and Neeson delivers all of his dialouge with a brilliant stone cold sincerity.<br/><br/>I say that the action is awesome, and it is, but it is pretty damn silly at times. This is sort of what I expected from this film, being that it is your typical fast paced action thriller to some extent. But I will say that no matter how ridiculous the action gets it is all shot very well. I always say that there is a lot to be said for a film with action sequences where you can tell what is going on. Taken is thankfully one of those films. It is intense and in your face, but not obnoxiously shaky. That's not something that can be said about many films these days.<br/><br/>The storyline in Taken doesn't have much to offer but you sort of have to let that go. Let's face it, Taken isn't trying to be a movie with a deep and intricate political noir thriller plot line. It is the story of a man searching for his daughter doing whatever he has to do and going wherever he has to go to get the job done. Taken does just about as much as it can do with this simple storyline and the most I can really say is at least it never gets boring. Nothing about this movie ever gets boring. In fact I have to commend it for being so consistently fun and action packed. Granted it's only and hour and a half and had it been any longer I probably would have gotten tired of it, and this review would have ended up being much more negative.<br/><br/>Taken is definitely a cool film. There's not a whole lot to it, but it is a really exciting film. Its got plenty of issues but you kind of just have to put all that behind yourself and take this simple, brutal, and intense action film for what it is. This is a great film for an hour and a half of escapist entertainment, plain and simple."

","I generally like Liam Neeson's movies very much, and in ""Taken"" he does not disappoint. He plays Bryan Mills - a father and ex-security agent of some kind - whose daughter is kidnapped by human traffickers while visiting Paris and who is about to be sold into sexual slavery. Bryan finds out about it (perhaps a bit too easily - he happens to be talking to his daughter on the phone from LA when the kidnappers take her) and immediately heads off to Paris to find her.<br/><br/>There's nothing confusing or complicated about the story. It's a straightforward account of Bryan's search for his daughter. It has pretty much everything you'd want in an action movie (including hand to hand combat, gunfights and car chases) and once the kidnapping takes place it pretty much is non-stop action. One of the problems I found with this was that - in spite of the action - it all did seem rather to easy. Bryan is told from the start that in dealing with this type of activity he has about 96 hours to find his daughter before she disappears forever. To meet that deadline everything does fall into place rather too easily, and there's the always present unbelievability of the fact that no matter how many bad guys Bryan is up against he always comes out on top (they can take many shots at him - even when he doesn't seem to be covered - and do no damage, while one shot from Bryan is all that's needed.) Perhaps Bryan comes across too much as a super-hero sort. <br/><br/>That aspect of unbelievability aside (and I concede that it's necessary to make this kind of movie) the story is plausible. Unfortunately, young girls do get kidnapped and forced into prostitution or sex slavery of various kinds. That aspect of the story (especially as Bryan comes across young girls drugged up and helpless - and who he can't take the time to rescue because he needs to find his own daughter) is actually quite disturbing. This is a good, fast-paced movie that tends to get stronger as it moves along."

His career caused him to become detached from his family, but now retired he seeks to at least reconcile himself with his next of kin. This plan hits upon a snag, when Kim begs him to allow her to go to Europe all by herself to rediscover the old continent. Bryan, being an old paranoid secret service freak, projects a bleak and dire vision of the dangers awaiting young pretty girls abroad. Unfortunately for common sense and realism Bryan turns out to be right as Kim gets kidnapped by the Albanian female slave trade upon arrival. Bryan quickly decides to revert to what he does best: killing and causing havoc.<br/><br/>The whole movie is spectacularly awesome. But only if you do your best to ignore the lame and rather ridiculous intro and outro of the thrilling roller-coaster (Americans being kidnapped for slave trade with the knowledge and acceptance of French secret service? Of all the cinematography bull I have been ever sold...). But than again the plot always seemed just to serve as an excuse to the action and the intriguing character of Bryan Mills. Liam Neeson is absolutely brilliant as a tough ex-secret service plus he does the best acting job in action-movie living memory. With a face full of emotion and anger you never doubt in his unwaning bloody conviction.<br/><br/>An additional bonus was the idea behind the lead character himself - a ruthless cold-blooded extremely goal-orientated killing-machine. Unlike many other heroes portrayed in cinema this one has one sole goal - save his daughter. Everything else is either collateral damage or - in the best case scenario - an opportune bonus (saving another girl, killing bad guys and so on). Even when saving a drugged out girl forced into prostitution his ulterior motive was not being a good guy, but extracting information from the victim that may aide his cause. Bryan Mills is basically ruthless and essentially devoid of higher morality, albeit with a code of honour that puts him head and heels above the perpetrators.<br/><br/>Not to mention the absolutely scintillating adrenaline channelling chases, fights and shootouts, which have a brutal in-your-face sense of realism to them. The movie does wander into the unbelievable zone quite often, but even then in manages to punch you in the gut, unlike all the modern CGI fight sequences.<br/><br/>All in all a welcome addition to the action genre and probably one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a while.

","The admirable plot synopsis provided needs no further description of the plot and the action. Liam Neeson surely must have been attracted by the very serious themes in the script, primarily written by Luc Besson. In the modern genre of very fast action, rough, tough and clinically effective a la Besson, the moral and political themes remind one however of the great era of Hollywoods major films which contained, under the surface of a passionate story, very strong moral and political themes that influenced generations not only in the west but also in the middle and far east. To-day, some of these major themes in the film which concern us deeply but need more attention in seeing the film Taken but need to be repeated in future films are: - - parentalguidance, responsibility and protection of our children (TV is full of failures of parents to accept fully what all this means) - young peoples gullibility in search of exciting experiences which can have grave consequences for parents and friends - the growing threat of immigration with criminal intent. As the film is made in Europe, it is the increasing influx of mafia like organisations from East Europe - the ever prevailant corruption in political circles - the ever prevailant demand for vengeance preferred to due process of law, despite the great increase in the proportion of the population with higher education The film is worth seeing several times to absorb all these issues.

","I have seen lots of action movies (yeah, all of Steven Seagal's too). To this date I liked Bourne trilogy, Die Hard 1, Transporter 1 as best action movies. And also ""Casino Royal"" where Daniel Craig kicks ass as James Bond. <br/><br/>This movie is amongst all those best ones I mentioned. Story is different than them and I think in action, revenge and clarity of mind Liam Neeson kicks major ass. Non stop action with thriller mixed in. I saw him in other movies but never got impressed. He looks older but full of energy. Now he looks like an action star to me. I am looking forward to Taken 2 now."

","This is one of the more enjoyable thrillers for quite some time. There is a good human element and story. There is a lot of action but because the way it is directed, it never seems too violent. You feel on Leeson's side for most of the killing and shooting. Pace and directing are excellent.<br/><br/>As usual they have to stereotype ethnic minorities and wealthy foreigners as villains but its a small flaw in the movie.<br/><br/>Maggie Grace is a bit large and ungainly looking and acts a bit silly and gushy for a 17 year old but I guess she wouldn't be in that position if she had been more sensible. It's a bit hard to believe she would be worth so many Euros to anyone.<br/><br/>A good warning for teens abroad too."

","It is what it is. A shoot-em-up action thriller. Story? What story? More shootings please. And throw in some big explosions too. You know what you're getting into with a movie of this genre. Movies such as these are never destined to be remembered as as any kind of classic cinema but if done right they can be thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable. And Taken is done right. Helped immeasurably by the strong performance of Liam Neeson in the starring role the movie is able to deliver exactly what it promised it would. Clocking in at just over 90 minutes it's a tight, well-paced thrill ride. You get plenty of great action and really that's all you're looking for out of a movie such as this.<br/><br/>Neeson plays recently retired CIA agent Bryan Mills who has settled in southern California to be close to his teenage daughter Kim who is now living with her mother and wealthy stepfather after her parents' divorce. The movie starts a little slowly as we set up the family dynamics but things pick up in a hurry. Bryan reluctantly agrees to allow Kim and a friend to go to Paris. Upon arriving in France it takes the girls approximately fifteen minutes (give or take) to get themselves kidnapped, destined to be sold into sex slavery. Luckily for Kim her daddy dearest has a very particular set of skills. Those skills will be put to the test as the clock starts ticking and Bryan faces a race against time to save his daughter.<br/><br/>And so Bryan arrives in Paris where he becomes a one man wrecking crew. The dead bodies start piling up. He really is making quite a mess. But nothing will stand in his way. As focused as a laser beam he will do whatever is necessary to bring his little girl home. As in all movies of this sort our hero is helped by the fact the bad guys are really stupid. And really, really bad shots. Apparently these guys haven't put in much time at the shooting range. At times it all does get a bit silly as our lone ranger dispatches villain after villain, extricating himself from any sticky situation with the greatest of ease. But you really only notice that if you stop and think about it. Don't think. Just watch and enjoy. Take the movie for what it is. It's exciting, it's entertaining. It is exactly what you would want a movie of this genre to be. Full credit to Neeson, upon whose shoulders the movie almost entirely rests. His performance is superb. He's a great hero who you identify with and root for all the way. It's a simple story, one man determined to save one girl. Neeson carries that story so well. If only all the other girls who were taken had a father like Bryan Mills."
"Erichnathanbennett","8","0","0","19 July 2010"," Taken is a masterpiece
","I love this movie. The concept, the meaning (sort of) and the acting was amazing. I've seen about half of all the James Bond movies not one of them comes close to this. When he said he was in the FBI I've never even heard of someone who was this good at kicking asses. James Bond is cool and all but when you take away his gun or his gadgets or car that's usually when he gets captured or one of his other agents rescued him. Bryan didn't even need a gun and he took out multiple people who had guns. Like when he was captured and was handcuffed to the pipe, he took out five or six guys with guns while he used his hands and was handcuffed. My favorite scene would probably be when he finally can get his daughter back and the fat guy is holding her with a knife to her throat and he knew exactly when to shoot him; when he started to talk (don't know what he was saying he was speaking in a different language) and he shot him and he finally got his daughter back. Sure the movie does seem a little unrealistic because he took down like a hundred guys like they were air but it's a movie, and movies are supposed to be unrealistic. What would have been cool is if the stepdad was the behind all of it and Bryan had one final battle. But it was still good. Bryan is like a ninth degree blackbelt in martial arts, james bond, and John Rambo combined together."

","This is based upon the Extended Harder Cut. So, this is Bourne with the whole ""it's personal"" thing that we got enough of in the 90's. Does it sound like this did not need to be made to anyone else? Then there's how this is just yet another ""24"" type hero(who completely lacks vulnerability, eliminating any sense of danger), who remains utterly invincible as he kills, tortures(which, as not enough people realize, can lead to the victim *lying*, or agreeing to whatever allegations are made against them... think about the witch trials) and doesn't negotiate with, ""bad guys"". The thing is entirely black and white, simplistic with obvious plot holes that they expect us to ignore, on account of this being supposed to move fast enough to prevent us from thinking about it. If it wasn't this dumb, or this relentlessly misogynistic, maybe it'd have worked. I didn't care for the superficial, offensive stereotypes, either. This is my first exposure to this director, and I guess it won't necessarily be the last. I do hope that he doesn't always go for flashy overstylizing; granted, there's not a ton of it, still, it's quite gratuitous. The action and chasing is intense and exciting(with well-choreographed fights and shootings) at its best, and there is tension in this. Editing and cinematography aren't bad(no Greengrass shaky-cam). I like that they have them speaking the correct, non-English languages. The acting is convincing. Bottom line, will it keep your adrenaline pumping fiercely for 90 minutes? Well, if you aren't too bothered by the layer of ""stupid"" that permeates it, pretty much, yes. You want something good to watch that's about the people trade, go for the mini-series Human Trafficking. It is infinitely more compelling and credible. There is a lot of brutal violence, and a little disturbing and/or sexual content in this. The DVD(that I got for a seventh of the price for a brand-new film on that format) comes with an average 18 minute behind-the-scenes featurette(partly in French but subtitled), a three minute storyboard comparison, and a trailer for this as well as for a handful of other movies. I recommend this to fans of this kind of thing. 7/10"

","Overall, an entertaining film and definitely worth watching, Liam Neeson, as always is excellent. In the nature of the story, the rest of the cast are somewhat incidental, although all demonstrate passable performances. The story is fundamentally good, if largely predictable, and holds the viewers'attention, however the plausibility in some of the details is questionable to say the least. During the course of the film, Neeson's character single-handedly eliminates at least two dozen of the bad guys, incurring barely a scratch in the process, and all his shots apparently on target, while hundreds of rounds are fired at him from the other side, all of which are miraculously off-target! Difficult to say more without giving it away - but enjoyable nonetheless."
"TheUnknown837-1","8","0","0","2 June 2010"," it's a real pleasure to see Liam Neeson tracking down some of the most sick, reprehensible villains in recent cinema history
","""Taken"" is one of the more pleasurable films regarding the subject of abduction and revenge to come out in recent years. And this may sound kind of morbid, but it's pleasurable in terms of the way that violence is projected. The violence is stunning, cruel, hair-raising, and may turn knots in your stomach and the movie does not shy from showing full-blast views of it to the audience. So why does this add up to a pleasurable film? Simply because these acts of violence and torture are conducted not on innocents (often) but upon some of the most sick, twisted, and morally reprehensible villains that we've seen in a motion picture in a long time. We don't really come to know these villains very well, and we really don't want to because of what we do see of them is truly horrible, and it's a pleasure to see vigilante justice being acted upon them.<br/><br/>The vigilante is played by the great Liam Neeson, one of the most underrated and talented actors of modern times. Neeson gives what may be his best performance since ""Schindler's List"" as a former CIA agent, known as a ""preventer"" who reluctantly allows his estranged daughter (Maggie Grace) to travel to Paris with a friend for vacation. Neeson, being reasonably over-protective, manages to make a phone call with his daughter while she's in France just at the moment when Albanian terrorists kidnap her. Armed with nothing but his skills and a little insight as to the men he's dealing with, Neeson goes to Paris and begins to track down everybody responsible for the kidnapping in a heart-pounding race to save his daughter from being trafficked into prostitution and never found.<br/><br/>This is a very sensitive and relevant subject and the movie plays on it with sincerity and authenticity. I mentioned earlier in my review that we don't really come to know these villains, the Albanian terrorists, and yet that's a positive element. The reason: what we do see of them is enough to know that these are some of the most despicable villains of recent cinema years - obviously because they're based on real-life scumbags from various parts of the world - and all we really want is to see them being killed off brutally and mercilessly. In a lot of thrillers of the past, I really didn't care what became of the villains, whether they died or went to jail or even got off scot free, but here, I was rooting every second of the way for them to get what was coming to them. And that is the core strength of the picture. The plot of a man trying to rescue his estranged daughter is not really new, but the fact that it's built around such a solid foundation for a taut, germane thriller makes it work.<br/><br/>""Taken"" is a very well-made film beautifully shot with deliberately gray and grim cinematography that gives it a harrowing and troubled atmosphere. Acting is superb. Liam Neeson shells out yet another terrific performance as the former ""preventer"" desperate to save his daughter from a fate worse than the brutal deaths he's about to deliver. The other key performance is the film is by Maggie Grace. Grace, at the time, was I believe 25 when making the film and yet she plays the 17-year-old with astonishing conviction. These are two very good modern performers and, partly because of the script, but more because of their performances, I bought them as human beings and related to them. Most other characters in the film come and go, but that's alright. The movie is about a father hoping to rekindle his relationship with his daughter and finding himself with the greatest challenge yet: saving her life.<br/><br/>""Taken"" is a great film, but it was treated with some disrespect before being released. I had some quirks on my note list after seeing the movie for the first time, mostly about the action scenes. I found it a little tiresome how Neeson could hit all of his enemies with the first shot and that sometimes he'd shoot them once and when they hit the ground, we could see 2-3 bullet holes in their chest. Other scenes seemed a little lacking, as if there was more to them. I tell you now: that's because there was. While the theatrical release of ""Taken"" is strong, the extended edition, available on DVD, is superior. Very little new footage, but extended moments of violence that completes the picture, adds competence to the action scenes, and makes many gritty scenes even grittier. Bottom line: both versions are quite good, but the extended edition is the one to see."

","The daughter on an ex-CIA agent is touring Europe with U2. Well, that idea ends quickly when she is abducted in Paris by the Albanian mafia, who want to get her hooked on drugs and sell her as a prostitute to the highest bidder. But they picked the wrong daughter to mess with! <br/><br/>Okay, let me just say first of all that I do not know how this film got such high esteem from the voters. Yes, it's awesome, but critically it's pretty cheesy. The acting is nothing special and the situations are impossible. Anyone who has any basic understanding of technology or intelligence gathering is going to slam their head into the wall.<br/><br/>But, if you ignore that, and just sit back and let the film take you, you're going to be amused. Liam Neeson kicks butt and shoots his way through Paris, doing everything he can to rescue his daughter because, for gosh sakes, he loves the little spoiled brat. And anyone who has ever loved will understand exactly how he feels... even if they don't have the resources necessary to kick as much booty.<br/><br/>I'm not one who watches a lot of Bond or Bourne or action flicks in general... but I loved this one.

"GrowMagicBeans","8","0","0","20 January 2010"," Neeson... now the angriest man in Hollywood!
","Liam Neeson takes up the role of action hero in a roller-coaster ride filled with rage, revenge, chases and fight scenes... Neeson's character, Bryan Mills, has left the CIA (or some generic 'secret agent' government type body) in favour of less demanding security detail jobs. You see, he wants time to re-establish bonds with his estranged daughter, while simultaneously trying to negotiate the minefield of ex-wives, their new rich husbands and all the social foux pas that come with the territory, but in normal 'family' life Bryan Mills is an utter failure... if only there was some way for him to PROVE his love!<br/><br/>...And that's about as far as the background plot goes, because as soon as status and role is firmly establish then -bam!- we're into global conspiracy, slave trade, drugs and sex! Of course Mills was worried about allowing his 17 year old daughter out into the big bad world, especially when she's traveling to a land as nefarious as Europe. It's a wonder that a man such as Mills –knowing what he does of the world– would allow her to follow a band, as iniquitous as U2, across several different countries... But in an attempt to placate a nagging ex-wife and win favour with a wayward daughter, he eases on his own rules, against his better judgment... just so long as she remembers to check in by phoning!!! Sure it is no wonder then that she only steps off the plane when already she is being eyed up and targeted by international kidnappers, as everyone knows that an American girl would fetch top dollar on the slave market... what they didn't count on though, was Daddy!<br/><br/>Of course the scheming, conniving, slutty friend that arranged 'accommodation' and even invited 'boys' over to the apartment must die as a matter of moral imperative, but not before a long procrastinated death, ODing from drugs forced upon her by her captives... too harsh? No, not for the Hollywood code... sure the daughter still may be alive. And Mills dedicates thirty seconds of his movie to demonstrate how her harrowing death has effected him. That's enough to keep us in hope for the daughter, yet get our blood lust turned up to eleven. Daddy's A-N-G-R-Y-!<br/><br/>Okay, so I'm being a little sarcastic with the story-line, but by building a plot which basically feeds upon a parent's worst fears, it defies certain plausibility. For example, the fact that the same gang would be audacious enough to return to the same airport 24 hours later (which gives Mills his first lead) really does take the biscuit. Are we really to believe that the foreign police forces' appetite towards chasing down international slavering gangs is so apathetic? But then again, if like me, you have that magic switch in your brain that allows you to overlook the implausibility of plot elements and accept a world where a parent's worst fears are bound to come true and Mills' uncompromising world view will always prove right, then this movie can be a lot of fun. Once Neeson has the rage turned on, the rest of the movie is just one continuous high-octane release... its unrelenting! It REALLY is!!! It becomes a visual collage of bone braking, crippling, shooting, jumping, thumping bad guys. Indeed, whether the bad guys are dirty, stubbly and wearing a black leather jacket, or clean shaven and looking sharp in a tux, one thing is guaranteed; they will always hold a sneer and look smarmy, that we really don't mind how high the body count runs. Indeed, these guys are so typically bad, its a pleasure to watch the pile of bones rise! I think Neeson may have stolen the crown off Mel Gibson (Ransom, Braveheart, Madmax) as being the angriest/sullen tough guys on screen."

","Liam Neeson plays a retired CIA agent whose former career has made him all paranoid, especially when it comes to worrying about his 17-year-old daughter's well being. When daddy's little girl asks him to sign a consent form so she may travel to Paris with her scatterbrained girlfriend (they actually are lying and want to follow a rock band all around the map), it's with grave reservations that he eventually complies. Once the girls arrive at their destination, it's only mere minutes before dad's worst fears are confirmed, and they're ""taken"" by foreign bad guys, to be drugged and sold as sex slaves. It's theorized that Neeson has only 96 hours to find and rescue his daughter before she becomes completely untraceable. As a fan of James Bond, I understand that many spy and action movies require accepting a lot of things that just aren't realistic. That's the fun of these types of films. But the contrived ease and lightning speed with which Neeson is able to arrive at the precise locations and track down and identify the specific criminals here, just struck me as totally unbelievable and cliché. Liam's fun to watch, and he's got some pretty cool lines ready for his daughter's captors, but in addition to the by-the-numbers approach to the material, there's a lot of hand-held and shaky camera craziness to distract those viewers who dislike such an approach. Go watch HARDCORE (1979) with George C. Scott instead. ** out of ****"

","Taken proves one thing beyond doubt: that even the cheapest schlock can sparkle in the right hands. Sparkles about the word, too, because there is less to Taken than a Bonfire Night sparkler. Fizz, fizz, fizz, then that's it. Taken is nonsense, but directed and acted at such a frenetic pace that you really don't have much time to reflect on anything except to wonder what might be coming next. The plot - I use the word loosely - stinks. Dad out to rescue his daughter. But as Dad happens to be a former CIA operative with an impressive array of technical and martial arts skills, the film gets a certain dimension. Liam Neeson is Dad, and does the action hero spiel rather well. Being rather the craggy sort lends him a credibility which is utterly spurious but which last as long as the film. And that is all that's needed. This is an action movie and nothing else. And it does not pretend to be anything else. It could have been atrociously bad, but it's not. It's very well-made, so the gaping plot holes - an example: an American (tho' Neeson is Irish, but let's let that pass) pretends he is a corrupt French cop and when he confronts a gang of ruthless Albanian thugs, they all speak English - don't rankle in the slightest. Lots of car chases, lots of gun-play, lots of fighting, lots of cleverness with all kinds of gadgets - what else good a boy want. Well, quite a bit more, actually, but Taken isn't that kind of film. It is what it is and basta cosi, so it deserves and extra mark for honesty. Don't look to closely, just enjoy the chase."

","Going into this film, I couldn't help but be a little pessimistic. Liam Neeson didn't really seem like the good guy type, and the plot seemed summed up in the trailer. Well, it turns out I was right about one of those. Liam Neeson actually did surprise me (and many others I'm sure) with his role in this movie and had all of us feeling what he feels and gave us the same motivation that you knew drove him. Maybe not with arm-breaking fervor, but we could feel it nonetheless. And even though the plot is summed up in the trailer, I found myself liking it. It seemed refreshing to have such a simple plot: Bad guy takes good guy's daughter. Good guy gets ticked, and goes to take her back. It seems like too many movies these days stretch its arms to grab viewers with a shock factor by throwing in irrelevant and often stupid twists...*cough,cough Orphan...*... You don't have to worry about any stupid or irrelevant surprises with this one. You are watching the movie that you paid for.<br/><br/>The only things I can say against it is that it was hard to make out how the daughter REALLY felt about her father other than just loving him, and it seemed to be wrapped up too quickly. I would have preferred a less rushed ending. But as far as the whole of the movie goes: Go watch it. It is well worth it. Maybe not the best movie of the year, but definitely one of the most well done.<br/><br/>I give it an 8."
"johnnyboyz","6","0","0","3 August 2009"," Rabid and unrelenting action film that teeters on the brink of both exploitation and as a dumb, guilty pleasure but pulls through on a basic level.
","Taken is a trashy, pulpy, throw-away thriller in every sense of each of those words and terms. It is a film that thrives on making the lead come across as down and as out as possible; one that thrives on making the people around him, both good and evil, come across as instantly and intensely dislikable as possible; and one that really thrives on rapid, cause and effect action which desperately tries to stay as realistic as possible but very much has its mind on the notion of escapism as it panders to a crowd. The film is a shameless action movie; a revenge film; a tale in which the women exist purely to be either rescued; act like complete wenches towards their ex-husbands; or get all excited at the prospect of a ride on a cute, four legged animal. And yet, there is a certain pleasure to be had out of it, a certain dumb but familiar sense of siding with the one likable character the entire film possesses, and just willing him on with a big smile on your face.<br/><br/>I have an odd relationship with Luc Besson; anything he's written and made himself from what I've seen, I've taken to. As a writer with view to produce, his work's been ordinary to just plain stupid at best. Taken is a slight exception; a piece that more resembles what 1985 action movie Commando might've looked like had someone like Donald Westlake written it. It sees Liam Neeson play a divorced man, from a marriage that saw him father a daughter, but essential to the plot, he is an ex-CIA operative now working relatively small time as a bodyguard with some buddies from the government years. His name is Bryan Mills (Neeson), although at one point during the opening in a jovial exchange with a past comrades, he is referred to as 'Rambo' in what is another link to past, Reaganistic driven action film-making of the 1980s on top of the already mentioned Commando. The fact he is referred to Rambo so early on produces slight smiles as you witness what transpires.<br/><br/>The inclusion of a friendly character very early on whom mentions Rambo assures me that Taken knows its place, knows what it is, and by the end, is hoping we're not taking it all so seriously as to despise the film as we watch on with our brows furrowed and our tongues entrenched within our cheeks. Bryan's isolation from his daughter, the antagonism he gets from his ex-wife and the fact she has a new partner anyway is enough to make you think he might just go nuts and wipe everyone out at a vomit-inducing, overly fluffy birthday party very early on. What Mills needs is his own noir fuelled franchise; with shady and fleshed out gangsters, a past tragedy driving the bitter, cynical and somewhat ruthless lead anti-hero whom isn't afraid to shoot first, ask questions later nor ask the questions first and then leave the poor guy to suffer whilst bound to a chair.<br/><br/>Then again, we get some of that in Taken; a film that crosses its wires all too often but gives us an experience we enjoy without ever taking too seriously, but are immersed enough to feel the threat, helplessness and desperation most characters go through. After going to Paris with a friend, Kim Mills (Grace) is swiped from her apartment, along with friend Amanda, in a ruthlessly efficient sequence that makes Elite Hunting and their Eastern Europe set up-come-operation look amateur. After no help from anyone, Bryan takes it on himself to go after her and recover her, thus kick-starting a blood-drenched trip to Europe where people will pay.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Taken is listed on the IMDb, under its 'country' sub-heading, as a French film and its view of France is a less-than-desirable one. I was reminded of the 2006 Venezuealan film 'Express Kidnapping', which looked at the frightening and harsh realities of what might happen if you're not careful on the streets of Caracas. In Taken, rather than integrate an individual city (in this case, Paris) into the story as it supports the basis of the study, writer Besson and director Pierre Morel cop out and somewhat disappointingly use Albanians as a means of getting across the antagonism. All this does is tell us that 'Yes, this may happen in a nation as developed as France but if it does, it'll be down to those immigrants whom have come over and set up their own operations'.<br/><br/>Taken doesn't hit particularly soar, but what else can you say about a film that, unashamedly I hope, uses that laugh out loud instance in which the hero sits at a café, reads a newspaper and then reveals to us that he wasn't actually reading it as much as he was spying on a suspected enemy. It recalls that glorious moment in one of Nick Park's early Wallace and Gromit shorts in which the ever-alert mutt of the title acts like he is reading a paper, but is actually stalking a suspicious character; all played out under a banner that blurs the lines between what we take seriously and what we find amusing by way of pastiche. The film is a bizarre blend of often hard hitting material revolving around torture, sexual slavery and shootings unfolded under an umbrella of the guilty pleasure, and the idea we're watching Liam Neeson in the lead role; but don't let that sound like it's a complete load of nonsense, because it carries a certain watchability about it, something that you don't often get the chance to say about action films these days."

","Let's see...it's a big budget movie, so it has to be based on a comic of some kind. No? Well, then a book maybe. Not that either? Sequel then? Perhaps a remake. Wow, wrong again. Well then it has to repeatedly rip off something else. Wow. Am I dreaming? ""Taken"" is probably the first big-budget action movie that is neither based on anything else or ripped off another movie or a TV show. Given how tired I am of comic books and other media being turned into movies I would have been more than willing to look the other way for having stolen bits from other movies, but no. Pierre Morel's 2008 film is completely original. I guess it helps that it was co-written by Luc Besson, an action-film director, but never mind. It's a pity it wasn't better.<br/><br/>Okay, fine. ""Taken"" is actually pretty good. It's unpredictable, and it doesn't follow a strict formula. More importantly, it kept my attention. But it didn't get my adrenaline pumping, which is the main reason why a person would see a movie like this.<br/><br/>Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is an ex-CIA guy who retired to spend more time with his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). Unfortunately, his wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) divorced him soon after. Now retired, Bryan has nothing better to do than to protect pop superstars (Holly Valance) and drive his ex-wife and daughter nuts with his ""paranoid"" views on what the world is REALLY like. But Kim and her friend are kidnapped while on a European vacation, Bryan sets out to find her, and woe betide anyone who gets in his way.<br/><br/>""Taken"" is a revenge thriller and a investigative thriller mixed into one (no, I'm not giving anything away). By nature, these movies are violent and brutal, and this one is no different. There are two words that explain why ""Taken"" was given a PG-13 rating instead of the R-rating it deserves: studio clout. I guess the corruption of the MPAA helps, but I think that's the same thing.<br/><br/>That being said, ""Taken"" has some things going for it. Liam Neeson is one of the better working actors out there today, and although Neeson is known for his protagonistic roles, he has no problem tackling the role of a man who has no qualms about killing anyone who gets in his way. Unfortunately, he's the lone good performance. I think part of the problem is that we don't care about Kim's fate. Part of the reason why is that she's played by Maggie Grace, who's pretty bad. At 26, she's too old for the part, although she tries to capture the same mannerisms and energy of the someone the same age (unfortunately, this makes her look ridiculous). I'm wondering why Famke Janssen took her role. She's a respected actress, but she doesn't have anything to do. The bad guys aren't vicious enough, either, which is another knock down.<br/><br/>Cinematographer turned director Pierre Morel has been given his first big chance at directing a major film (his first credit, District 13, was not widely seen in the United States), and he doesn't screw it up. He uses the shaky cam technique (something that I generally hate), but overall, he does it well. Usually it works, although there are times when it makes things confusing.<br/><br/>Although ""Taken"" lacks the visceral thrill that makes these kinds of movies work, it's still worth a viewing. And you might like it a lot better than I did. The person I watched it with loved it."

The plot though is very thin and clichéd (especially in the beginning) and the characters are very narrow and one sided but the film's not really about neither one of those aspects: it's all about the thrilling atmosphere and Liam Neeson kicking some serious butt.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is great in the leading role and he's the best the film has to offer; if it had been some one else than him in the role I probably wouldn't have been interested about the film. He's convincing as an aged former spy, beyond his best years but still more than capable in killing and torturing people. He's not a good guy, just a troubled father who goes as far as it's required to find what he's looking for. The supporting cast does a decent job but the film lives with Neeson's performance.<br/><br/>Pierre Morel does OK job directing the flick; along with Neeson's great performance, the film has a nice, fast pacing and the action is well filmed and brutal enough to fit the bleak situation the characters have to face.<br/><br/>This is Liam Neeson's show whether you like it or not, there's no question about that so it helps if you like the guy. It may be tough if you don't because the films assets are very much limited and Liam being the biggest one in that bunch. 3/4"

","I knew this would be good when I saw Luc Besson's name in the credits. For those who don't know, he wrote and directed La Femme Nikita, one of the great Violent Entertainments of all time. I enjoyed Taken. Imagine the daughter of a 50-year-old Jason Bourne being kidnapped, and the pure shitstorm which would descend upon the perpetrators, and you'll have a pretty good handle on this story. As others have mentioned, the plot is simplicity itself: Liam Neeson is going to get his daughter back, and no thing or individual will prevent that. There is, of course, the usual need for suspension of disbelief—in the first gunfight, our hero has inconsistent marksmanship; aboard the yacht at the end it's one bullet, one kill—but hey, that's film making. Viewers whose expectations are within the Revenge Mission scope of this film will enjoy it thoroughly. Anyone looking for social depth or complex character development will be disappointed."
"Lemniscate433","8","0","0","20 July 2009"," Watch at your own risk. Nesson is no longer a gentleman like his other movies.
","We have seen Nesson basically act very nice and soft in his other movies and I have no doubt that he can act well in that type. However, us viewers forgot that Liam Nesson is on the top 10 list in Hollywood of actors that can act as characters who you do not want to mess around with.<br/><br/>In this film, Nesson plays an ex-agent. We do not get much detail of what he does for a living, so ex-agent is as far as we know about him. His daughter wants to go to Paris with her friend and at first, Nesson's character did not feel comfortable of letting her daughter go. But after being guilted by his ungrateful and spoiled ex-wife, he let's his daughter go. The two girls go to Paris, develop the stupidity to tell a French man which hotel they are staying at and which floor they are on, and, well, you know happens. They are taken and thrown into the slave trade. No big surprise.<br/><br/>But what you got to realize about this movie is that it is very realistic in that regard. There are many girls that have done this mistakes. Even boys have done this mistake. And having a background like that in the movie makes it more believable and less like a Steven Segal action-flick.<br/><br/>And the great thing in this film is that Nesson's character is really cool about it. Throughout the whole film, he is not stressing a bit because he has a lot of self-esteem and self-worth. He knows that he is guy who can kick ass and beat the living daylight out of men he does not like. The character does not have a single doubt in his mind that he will never see his daughter again. In the film, tells the enemy, ""Look, give me my daughter, and I will not have to mess you up. If you do the opposite, then I will kill you."" <br/><br/>The action scenes are fantastic and awesome to watch. And the thing is that all the action scenes are actually more realistic than your average action scene because it is not stylized at all. Nesson just kicks their ass, kills them, and leave them. And he moves on to another criminal entourage to do the same thing. That is real fighting because fights between people do not last long; they pretty much end after ten seconds or so.<br/><br/>And you can not complain about Liam Nesson playing the main role because he acted well for this part. At the same time of being calm and quiet, he is also very relentless and coercible with his fighting. I could not ask for any better of an actor to play this role.<br/><br/>My only problem with this movie is that it is too short. But then again, if it were longer, I probably complain about it being too long. But I have not seen the director's cut of Taken so I want to be able to obtain that version and see some more action scenes.<br/><br/>If you really like action movies, this is the movie for you. Even if it is not stylized like some James Bond film, you will definitely be entertained. Just, do not watch it with your daughter. I give this movie a low 8."

","I've been relatively disappointed with the state of action movies for the past couple of years. They seem to have been relying more and more heavily on perversely complex plots, overdone cgi, and contemporary ""gimmicks"" like shaky cam while missing the simple point of exciting the audience. But not Taken. Taken gets it just right.<br/><br/>Those over 25 might recall that almost a quarter decade ago, Schwarzenegger (still in his fun prime - not yet his shameful republican deficit years) starred in ""Commando"" as John Matrix - an almost superhuman all-out good-guy who must rescue his daughter from the forces of evil that have abducted her. What follows is an unbelievable, violent, and fun guilty pleasure for the viewer. It occurred to me while watching Taken that this movie is really just an updated version of Commando - a little more realistic in terms of plot perhaps, but no less fun for it.<br/><br/>Neeson is a superhero in this film, untouchable and unbeatable, it's supremely satisfying to see the simplistic bad-guys get their violent comeuppance in various gruesome ways. Dare I say, it's truly refreshing to see a return to the good old action basics that have been so apparently absent in recent years."

","Wow, If only I had a dad like that.<br/><br/>That was the words silently spoken out of the minds of thousands of movie-goers walking out of the viewing of ""Taken"" an all-out action film straight out of the minds of Director Peirre Morel.<br/><br/>The movie is a plot-less, killing machine, and had never been anymore fun then this. The movie starts off with divorced dad Bryan Mills living as an ex-agent, and always keeping an eye on his daughter as she leaves for Paris. Everything is fine until her abduction into the real world begins. Rushing to Paris to save her from the sex predators who have taken her, Mills begins an extreme killing-outing. Leaving a mess wherever he goes like, a highway chase, a construction-site shoot-out and a bedroom-fight. Sure, the action is fake, unrealistic and very dumb, but, it doesn't matter, as long as the film stays true to it's self, which isn't hard to considering the only thing the movie relies on is some funny lines, some good action, and nothing more. But, if you look beyond this, the film really does have a good sense to it. Almost like a mystery. As Bryan goes from a whore-bidding to a cruise ship, and all around Paris looking for what he lost. A good film by all means, and even more then that, a classic. For, Mills personality (ability to shoot a married woman without even flinching) will strike the minds of viewers for ages. And, revealed the true fear of the outside world that had never been covered until now. so, now matter how you like you're action films, Bauer fan or Bourne fan, Jones fan or John McLain fan, ""Taken"" is a great action thriller and a real surprise for anyone who wants to see an un-realistic version of a P/O father, so, forget ""Yippie Ki Yay"", I will find you, and I will kill you!"

","Luc Besson writes the kinds of movies I enjoy watching. Not all of his, but movies like ""Nikita"", ""Messenger"", and ""Leon"" are some of my favorites. He co-wrote this movie, ""Taken"", and it is a good one. Not surprisingly it goes back to a city he knows well, Paris.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is a mostly retired Bryan Mills. We don't exactly know what he did before retirement, but in conversations with his 3 buddies, and when we see him defend a young singer when he is hired for one gig as a bodyguard, we know he has skills most 50-ish men don't have.<br/><br/>We also find out that he has been mostly absent in the growing-up years of his 17-year-old daughter, but he has moved to Southern California to be close enough to be in her life.<br/><br/>Famke Janssen is Bryan's ex-wife Lenore. She is now married to a wealthy man who has made life easy for her and the daughter.<br/><br/>With that as background, the story starts when the daughter requests to go to Paris to stay with a friend's relatives, and spend a lot of time visiting Paris museums and libraries. But because she is a minor both parents have to approve of her traveling out of the country. Bryan is very reluctant, he has seen enough to know it is dangerous for naive teen girls to be traveling alone. Add to that a deception ... the girls really had a multi-city European trip planned to follow around their favorite rock group in a musical tour. Lenore knew this but withheld that from Bryan.<br/><br/>After a scene Bryan, with grave reservations, agreed to let his daughter go, but only if she would call him as soon as she arrived, and each day to assure him she was OK. As soon as the two girls got to Paris things started to go bad, and Bryan had to press himself into action.<br/><br/>I like this movie because it is a classic matching of wits of a determined good guy, Bryan, against the criminal element. Plus it is long enough at 90 minutes to tell the story but still short enough to never get boring. I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW: There is an Albanian criminal element operating in Paris to nab pretty, young girls and sell them into sexual slavery. They employ young men to attract the attention of targets by offering to share a cab ride from the airport. This lets them know where the girls are staying so that a trained team can come in and kidnap the girls. Which is what happens here, made easier by the adult relatives being in Spain, details they share with the young man. But Bryan is on the phone with his daughter when the kidnappers arrive, and he is able via tape recording to get important clues, plus a brief conversation where he tells the kidnapper that if he doesn't release the teens right away he would be tracked down and killed. ""Good luck"" says the crook, and these two words enable Bryan to know when he met him face-to-face. Bryan is very good at what he does, he finds the girls, kills all the crooks eventually, and even in the process exposes some police payola activity which ends up giving him his free pass to leave France."

","Fast-paced, well shot, suspenseful and action packed, Pierre Morel's 'Taken', shot mostly on the streets of Paris, is both refreshing and entertaining. It's been a while since I last saw such an exiting and energetic thriller. Morel's direction is wonderful. While there is something Hollywoodish about it, there's also a non-Hollywood feel. The chase scenes and action sequences are superbly executed. The story may have its share of plot holes but there is plenty more to enjoy. The chilling theme of trafficking women is well infused into the story (even though it's not fully developed, but then again, this is an action film). Liam Neeson may seem like an unconventional choice but proves that he can single-handedly carry an action film. He does a good job in the action scenes and brings depth to Bryan, making him both relatable and likable. Maggie Grace shows the potential of a great actress as she delivers a sincere performance. Famke Janssen is good in her part. Overall, 'Taken' is an energy-driven thrill ride. There is not one single boring moments. Even the 'quieter' scenes in the beginning between Bryan and his daughter and his friends is fun to watch. Highly recommended."

","Bryan Mills is a retired CIA operative whose seventeen-year-old daughter is kidnapped by a bunch of Albanian white-slave traffickers the moment she arrives in Paris. Instantly, Mills launches into secret agent mode, utilizing all the tricks-of-the-trade he picked up during his years in the service to single-handedly track down his daughter and bring her abductors to justice. Clearly, James Bond has nothing on this guy.<br/><br/>As action thrillers go, ""Taken"" is considerably less plausible than most (which is saying a great deal), filled as it is with preposterous coincidences and feats of superhuman dexterity, but director Pierre Morel does know how to get the adrenaline pumping - which, let's face it, is all one really asks for from a high-octane popcorn movie such as this one.<br/><br/>To make the movie more ""relatable"" for the audience, screenwriters Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen have concocted a rather dreadful scenario in which Mills has quit his job and moved to California so he will be able to spend more time with his daughter, only to find that he now has to compete with her gazillionaire step daddy for her attention and affection. But all that malarkey is done away with in the early stages and - good news for action fans - once the movie hits the throttle, it never lets up.<br/><br/>The European tourism industry is bound to take something of a hit with this film - and, seriously, all of this just to get some rich guys laid?

","I think myself very generous when rating movies, not that this was a bad one. In fact, on the action level, it was very entertaining and exciting even though anyone could have predicted the end. The plot is very linear, video game-like, meaning that the guy beat out a bunch of bad guys and gets to the final boss who evidently is of the almost same power. The character development in itself is nearly absent, the stunts and the overall superiority of the main character to his surrounding are pretty far-fetched and unreal considering that there would be no way a guy of his age or shape, adding to that that he has taken his retreat, could do (heck, even Arnold or Bruce lee could not that) . Past that, if you are looking for another James bond movie, minus the stupid romance and long emotional scenes, then this is a movie for you. The acting is pretty action-like good, although the 17 year old daughter is clearly not seventeen, i mean her friend looks younger than her. At least its not worse than one tree hill, which i totally despise. Also, i do not like the fact that once again the American are portrayed as good while the other races are simply bad.<br/><br/>anyhow, the movie is fluid and very interesting to watch."

You know that this could just as easily be a non-fiction documentary as it could be fiction.

The rest of the acting is okay, but Liam Neeson is the only true standout of this movie.<br/><br/>By the time the father eventually finds his daughter, you are truly tied into the story and you want him to free her.

Leland Orser as the oversympathetic friend (again), Xander Berkeley wasted in a nothing role (again), and why does that X-man chick with the exotic name keep getting work? Not a very interesting performer, except in MADE. I feel for Neeson, losing his pretty, talented wife and his viable career in the same decade, but maybe this one's some solace for him. Pretty good box office, doing good on video... but he SUCKS in it, again, wooden and not credible. I've never believed him except in that Woody Allen movie. Minute 30-something and I'm about to turn it off.<br/><br/>Then he gets to Paris. Suddenly this is a good movie. Good fights, especially Qui-Gon getting pulled out of a cab by the heels and conking his head on the curb. When he smacks his face on that sidewalk, I sit up. I'm interested. Not out of blood lust, but because something's happening. The movie is moving for the first time. The situations are now not quite as stock. I decide to give it another five minutes.<br/><br/>Which turns into the next hour. Nonstop violence in the b-movie mode, exciting and cheap and nasty and occasionally surprising just in the depths it's willing to go in investing its hero's need. Yes, it's silly: this guy is the Terminator, for no reason that's well enough explained in the story. He's the guy the phrase ""one man army"" was invented for.

","If you liked THE BOURNE TRILOGY and the recent Bond film--not QUANTUM OF SOLACE, which sucks, but CASINO ROYALE, which rocks--then you will dig this movie. It promises thrills and chills and drive and action. It delivers.<br/><br/>It contains one serious flaw, however, which will annoy some. But considering that IMDb users gave it an 8/10 rating it is clear that most won't care about the flaw, won't notice it or will simply like the movie so much that they will rationalize the complications it creates away without acknowledging that no rationalization, however imaginative, can make them go away. The remainder of the film and particularly the ending as they stand simply won't support such a huge suspension of belief.<br/><br/>The problem goes to plausibility, logic. And it really bugs me. Usually, such a honker of a problem would spoil the whole film for me. Yet, I still like it. A lot. I give it a 7 out of 10 with the flaw, and an 8 out of 10 without it . . . that is to say, removing it would subtract nothing from the story, and that's what's really weird about it not being removed before the movie was released.<br/><br/>Removing the flaw and the sequences attached to it would have required shooting two or three other sequences in their place, but this wouldn't have injured the rest of the film at all, no other changes would have been required. Just a swap. The rest is fine.<br/><br/>Hence, the problem is just as glaringly obvious as its solution is simple.<br/><br/>How the screen writer and the director could miss it and still be capable of producing an otherwise brilliant and riveting action flick is mysterious. Even assuming that the screen writer and director are idiot savants or brilliant drug addicts, how did the film editor miss it? Oh, well. There it is. A really good action movie just the same.<br/><br/>The only thing that really makes any sense, as the rest of the film cannot be a brilliant accident, is that the filmmakers started out with one idea, realized it didn't add up in the editing room after the last take and after the players were released. That sometimes happens. So you throw up a few sets, recall the pertinent players and fix it. Budget? Other commitments? Who knows.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen it, I won't divulge anymore about the film except to say that the problem involves the inclusion of a certain, utterly unnecessary character--the French internal security agent. Cut him out, and all of the complications stuffed inside his baggage disappear.<br/><br/>But check it out. It's well worth the aggravation.

","Adverts for this film had me looking forward to, at the very least, a formulaic that cannot fail: Bad guys get their due by the hand of a righteous good guy. Vengeance is served somehow, and all that. Overall, the film delivers on its promise.<br/><br/>It is not exemplary in its genre however. I wish I could cite a title that really gives that satisfaction that is set up by the words 'I will find you and I will kill you'. A film or TV show that does that is a rare find.<br/><br/>To get that vigilante righteousness where you can applaud the protagonist for banging heads and killing everyone that crosses his/her path is a key issue. It most often requires that the antagonist be really really bad, to the point that that their crimes are so disturbing as to be unimaginable. This is perhaps why I cannot name a more satisfying film. I may have blocked it out.<br/><br/>Perhaps ""Die Hard"" could be called into play here, because I recall it was eminently satisfying and not too disturbing. But ""Die Hard"" does not exactly fit into this genre. It should not be a spoiler to say that kidnapping is an element of both, but that alone would hardly describe either film.<br/><br/>""Taken"" does not spend enough time on the guy that offered 'good luck'. You barely know who it is before it is gone from the story. Once you see it, you will agree that this is no spoiler, the film and the adverts did that already. Action sequences are implemented with more cuts than bristles on your toothbrush.<br/><br/>It is more convenient to have a series of action sequences filmed and then piece them together in an ineffective effort rather than choreograph them before the start. This shortcut has plagued many an otherwise good film and ""Taken"" is no exception. See, I just did that. You have no idea what I am saying.<br/><br/>I will now make it clear, this movie is not all that great. It was not bad, I enjoyed it. I watched it alone and was expecting to re-watch it with someone else once I could recommend it, but I cannot. I will not invest another 14000 heart-beats that would be required for a 2nd viewing."

","Indeed this movie has its flaws, particularly some of the scenes in the last twenty minutes. People have complained that these scenes were too unrealistic and I recognize that criticism. What those critics need to understand is simply that this movie is only an hour and a half, and at least an hour of it was very realistic. If this movie was two hours long then I could really identify with those critics.<br/><br/>Anyways the particularly objectionable scene in the movie is when he jumps onto the boat from a bridge and proceeds to disable twenty or so men with little resistance. Liam Neilson didn't even get shot at once in that scene! Regardless, it was over quickly...<br/><br/>Moving on to the things that are good about this movie, I was really quite impressed by how Liam Neilson did that urban climbing to reach into the scene of the crime. It really draws you into the movie into the movie in the beginning and then it is non-stop action, and it is much more realistic then most action movies. Liam Neilson is quite simply awesome and he really helped make this movie what it is.<br/><br/>Some people say that this movie is ""propoganda for the new world order"" or something similar because Liam Neilson tortures people to find his daughter. Most people who watch this movie would eventually recognize that what Liam Neilson has done is not worth it and they won't come out thinking ""torture is a great idea"". I mean even the police were after him for how he destroyed countless pieces of property and he stole peoples cars.<br/><br/>If anything you realize that Liam Neilson in this movie really likes to torture and kill people after all they were suggesting that was what his profession was and that is what he was doing every single day (because he liked it). The only question is why the heck did he retire? He seemed like he would still be good at his old job...<br/><br/>If anything you will come out of this movie thinking that fathers should be more protective of their daughters until they get a husband, and I can speak from experience in saying that, that is a good idea."

We want Bryan to find his daughter no matter what it takes and there is no political correctness in here as witnessed by the torture scene. For a movie to get us to care so much in the beginning is unusual indeed and a compliment to Neeson and Grace as both exhibited exceptional chemistry. <br/><br/>This was perhaps the fastest hour and a half I have experienced in a long time. He knows his window of getting her back is small. As each obstacle rose up it was like I was pushing Bryan to get it over with quickly and on the next path to finding his daughter.

","The movie Taken is about a retired spy Brian played by Liam Neeson. The plot of the movie is pretty straightforward. So, if you are watching this movie to see something fresh, I am afraid that the only thing fresh that you are going to see in this movie are the faces. Yes, it is like an old story in perhaps a different location, with a different cast and a slightly different way of looking at things. Brian is a retired spy who used to protect the country from international enemies by doing certain operations and so on. The cost that he has had to pay in order to do this job is that he has not been able to spend time with his family and is estranged from his daughter. He is now retired in hopes of making up for the lost time. Time and now of course he does security provision assignments for local concerts and shows.<br/><br/>One fine day, the daughter chooses to go to Paris and since she is a minor she needs her father's permission. Having seen the world, Daddy is all too concerned but finally lets go. And as any seasoned movie goer can guess even though he might know nothing about the plot of the movie, he can guess that something is about to happen to the daughter. And it does! No points for guessing that! She gets kidnapped conveniently letting her father listen to the voice of the kidnapper since the kidnapping happens while she talks to her father! And in then we see non-realism at its best. He guesses the kidnapper, his origin, his possible hideouts and regions of operation. He goes to Paris, he kicks ass and he tracks down the guys and gets back his daughter. Plenty of gun action. And it is pretty straight. The spies are suppose to be good with guns. But how good are they with their hands? My god! They move so fast that the cameramen cannot capture a single punch on the screen. For those who might have accidentally read my one or two other reviews, I have always been someone who complained about the camera being moved too fast to capture a punch. I hate such photography. I want to see a punch delivered, I want to feel for a moment the strength of the hero as he lands a punch on his opponent. This movie denied me that.<br/><br/>The action flows smoothly in the movie. The direction is about okay. The movie is never realistic. A major complaint I have about the movie is that I do not feel any love between the father and the daughter. Of course they are supposed to be estranged but still overall on the emotional front, there is nothing much that the movie delivers. It is a pure action movie and it portrays action at the cost of everything else - including realism and emotion. The only emotion that finds strength is the brutal anger of the hero as he unleashes hell on the streets of Paris.<br/><br/>Overall, a mindless flick worth watching if an escape from reality is what you are looking for!"
"BigWhiskers","9","0","0","19 May 2009"," Good action and Liam definitely rises above the material
","Very entertaining action flick with Liam in rambo mode as a divorced father who goes after his daughter who is kidnapped by human slave traders in Paris. Supposedly Liams' character was some type of commando in his earlier days and has deadly skills ,hand to hand combat and espionage. he uses his old commando buddies resources to help track down the kidnappers and boy does he ,leaving a trail of dead bodies. He does eventually find her in an explosive climax. If you don't think about certain plot holes you will really enjoy the movie. The main plot holes I saw were , how does he know people in french security- its never explained just implied they worked together before, he also fakes a french director or securities ID - how does he do that and how does he find out that someone on the inside of french security is involved in the selling of young girls including his old french security buddy. these are a few as well as shooting the wife of the traitor security buddy and beating him up - never explains how he wraps that up or gets out of the country with his daughter and what happens to the others, the daughters girlfriend he finds dead most likely of drug overdose yet he just leaves her there and no one asks about her. anyway , i enjoyed it and usually you will find plot holes in any kind of spy thriller..

"CagedinSanity","8","0","0","18 May 2009"," Guilty as Charged
","I use the phrase ""Guilty as Charged"" because this movie doesn't pretend to be something it's not. The trailers portrayed exactly what the movie became, and didn't make the mistake of falsely hyping it up. The entire movie is perfectly summed up in the trailers with Leam's character's cell phone call; <br/><br/>(Don't quote this by the way, typing this by memory) ""I don't know who you are, and if you're looking for ransom I can tell you I don't have any money. But what I do have is a very specific set of skills that I have acquired over a very long career, a set of skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you return my daughter now, that will be the end of it. I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will hunt you, I will find you, and I will kill you.""<br/><br/>And that's exactly what happens.<br/><br/>I was excited when I first saw these previews before most other people - in a theater watching another movie entirely. I made it a mission to find this movie, buy it, and watch it. And it was worth the new release price.<br/><br/>It's a basic premise. A divorced retired man who's had a vague and somewhat unexplained past job. A minor complaint right here. He calls himself a ""preventer"" and judging from his first job in the movie, I've come to assume he works as some type of security agent for the government. They should have clarified this better. Anyway, it's an interesting premise and reveals that he's not a remarkable super-hero. He's a man. With a broken family, but has a happy daughter regardless that loves him anyway. I liked this.<br/><br/>It doesn't take terribly long to get through the introductions, which is good because some of it seemed a bit forced. For example, when Bryan's (Leam) ""war""-buddies come for a barbecue and start spouting their past adventures. Now, I don't know what government agents talk about casually but knowing how the job is, I don't see it very realistic to talk about things like that.<br/><br/>Now, I love me some character-development but the first ten minutes or so fell pretty flat. Fortunately, it gave you the bare-bones storyline and continues onward to the daughter being captured (""Taken"", rather) and Bryan immediately gets to work with impressive and realistic (to me, anyway) resourcefulness. Including speed, as one of his friends inform him he has 92 hours before never seeing her again. Third complaint? The time limit mentioning seemed very unnecessary, and near the end it wasn't a fast-paced ""race against time"". It felt like he had plenty of it.<br/><br/>Everything else was great. I'm a huge fan of the Bourne movies and this felt like that, to a lesser extent. Not a lot of evading was happening, but Bryan constantly blew a hole through this particular slavery organization.<br/><br/>Not much else to say. My first paragraph of this review really sums up all my thoughts."
"hpipik","9","0","0","18 May 2009"," Rollicking good movie but I will pick some nits
","Go to the cinema or get the DVD and see the movie. If you like action packed thrillers this movie is for you. As another reviewer said, it will be the fastest 93 minutes you have had in a long while. I loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>Like most great movies, the plot is clean and spare. The bad guys have messed with the wrong girl. Daddy loves his little girl, he is coming to get her, and too bad for anybody (including former friends) who stand in the way. That said, I want to pick some nits.<br/><br/>First, so far as I know Liam Neeson is a nice guy who loves his family, is kind to animals, works hard, and deserves whatever success he can get. I am glad ""Taken"" is a winner for him. But the movie offers a couple of scenes where a really good actor could have delivered an Oscar-winning performance, and Neeson does not measure up.<br/><br/>For instance, Bryan Mills (Neeson) is a man who knows the world and the evils it contains. When he hears on the phone his little girl screaming as she is being brutally kidnapped into sex slavery (NB: this is really not a spoiler since this scene is in all the trailers), Neeson could have shown us something more than a dead-pan face that passes for steely resolve. Where was the horror? The pain? The anguish? <br/><br/>Another scene is when Mills discovers the brothel full of kidnapped girls. They are innocent things, just like his own daughter, imprisoned by thugs and drugs and practically sold by the pound like so much meat. Yes, Mills is on a mission to rescue his own daughter, but does he not have an ounce of sympathy for these forsaken girls who are the daughters of other fathers and mothers? It is true that he kills a number of the Albanian sex slavers, but it is not at all clear that he is doing it out of sympathy for these other girls or only because they are slowing him down in his mission to rescue his own daughter. As I said, I think Neeson could have done more, and it would have been much the better for him and for the movie.<br/><br/>My second nit is language. One mark of a really great movie is when the English speak English, the French speak French, the Germans speak German, etc. In a couple of scenes, had Neeson spoken in French, I think the movie would have really sparkled. Too bad about that.<br/><br/>Finally, there is Maggie Grace who plays the daughter, Kim. She is a beautiful woman and I wish her only success, but not for a moment did I believe she was 17 yrs old (which she is not). From Paris to Hollywood, Pierre Morel could not find an actress who looks 17? Really? To me this is an inexplicable casting error. Maybe Morel used the same guy who cast Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, so this is not the only such mistake, but damn! Talk about unforced errors.<br/><br/>But for these unforced errors, I think ""Taken"" could have been Oscar winning material. We will just have to settle for a rollicking good movie."

","This movie was a non-stop thrill ride. The intensity was off the scale.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge nit-picker when it comes to movies so keep that in mind, but I really enjoyed Taken.<br/><br/>Other reviewers whined about Liam Neeson's character, Bryan, and how he didn't rescue the other kidnapped, soon to be prostitute girls, but that wasn't his goal.<br/><br/>His single minded drive to rescue his daughter was exactly how a man trying to find his child should be. We all know our children come first and any good parent would do all they could to get them back.<br/><br/>I know most of us don't have government training and elite martial art skills, but these were second to his ruthless drive to complete his mission.<br/><br/>I give this movie 9/10 for extreme awesomeness, it was everything I'd hoped it would be!"
"das417","8","0","0","18 May 2009"," An action movie that stands out
","Taken is an action movie that stands out not because of great writing, or directing, but because it is an enjoyable film that shows that pure entertainment still works today. One doesn't need a ""best movie nomination"" hanging over a movie for it to be enjoyable or a budget of over one hundred million dollars. Taken reminds us that the basic plots and action scenes can still work to entertain and create a plot that can stand on its own.<br/><br/>Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a retired CIA agent who finds that his most difficult mission is to stay a part of his distant daughter's life. Kim (Maggie Grace) is a spoiled teenage girl whose mother, Lenore (Famke Janssen) does her best to not only shelter her but also keep Bryan out of her life. Bryan himself knows this but patiently waits for the time when he can be there for Kim in order to make up for the lost years he spent around the world. Her 17th birthday is a chance to do that but also reminds him that Kim belongs to a world where he has no place despite his hopes.<br/><br/>Kim's trip to Paris is a dream vacation that will let her see Europe. However, when she is kidnapped by a gang of Albanians, Bryan discovers that his old skills are needed once more as he hunts down those responsible for her daughter's disappearance. Lenore herself pleads for Bryan to bring their daughter back and that is he swears he will do. It is then that he discovers a secret that is traced by to a friend and a corruption with the French government.<br/><br/>Bryan spends most of the movie searching Paris and destroying the Albanians who kidnapped not only his daughter but other girls who are later sold into slavery. One can argue that some of the skills used by Bryan are not realistic and that the action scenes are clichéd. What stands out perhaps most of all is Bryan's use of voice technology to identify one specific Albanian which forces us to ask if the CIA is really that powerful to track and identify even a minor criminal. However, in comparison to Bond or the Bourne movies with their over the top technology, is there really a difference? <br/><br/>Liam Neeson is a convincing agent and shows that he is still one of the top actors. Maggie Grace was not as believable as a 17 year old but she played her small part of being a kidnapped daughter well for what its worth. Taken is a movie that remind us that good movies still exist aside from major releases and that one doesn't need an ""original"" concept to entertain.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Life can be mysterious: As I left Paris for a visit to my family, I read during the trip the Council of Europe (CoE) issue about the new convention against human trafficking (GRETA). In the evening, I picked the Sin City story called ""Hell and Back"" and I was surprised to see that it was about the same criminal activity. Today, as I got up for breakfast, I turn on the satellite mosaic and among all the screens, I noticed someone looking like Famke Jansen. I picked the channel and it was indeed her! With Liam Neeson her ex-husband, they said farewell to their daughter leaving for  Paris ! <br/><br/>As American movies about France are my weakness, I just went on watching. As the daughter was abducted, I was indeed taken! I couldn't switch it off until I know her final fate. Then, a great thriller started with an excellent Liam! Sure, he can inspire some security and courage! It's ""funny"" to notice how his character and Frank Miller's Wallace are close: the two are hard-boiled, terribly lethal and for achieving their rescue, discover a modern criminality! As CoE states, this activity is hard to notice, makes a lot of money, which explains it has become the great deal of criminals today! It was a great eyes-opener for me all the more than the action happens in my city: for example, the car chase in which he drives full speed against the traffic is the same place when I got stuck with my bike and unable to cross the road with too many cars! <br/><br/>So if the movie was a good moment, the only problem was maybe his denial! It's great to have a Superman as father but for all the people who haven't one, the story would be different! For example, Liam is too focused about his daughter that it isn't clear if he took the opportunity to save the other girls by the way! Finally, it's a pity this movie is just action or adrenalin and forgets the real tragedy: it would have been great in the closing credits to have lines about the number of cases of unresolved disappearances, just to have a definitive picture about this terrible drama!"

And I am not talking about how likely it is to casually kill or otherwise incapacitate tens of people and getting away with it, but how likely it is to gather data, torture or threaten with death or torture to get more data and so on until you get to the top of the human trafficking system in a very short time? <br/><br/>I understand the need for due process and everything, but hell, Liam Neeson's character took out a complete human flesh network from the bottom up in a few days.

"druid333-2","9","0","0","5 May 2009"," Why Liam Neeson Is One Of Our Finest Actors Today
","Liam Neeson has certainly taken on his share of commanding & varied roles in films,from supporting (check out his work on 'The Bounty')to his lead work in 'Michael Collins'. 'Taken',a film with a script co-written with Luc Besson is another shining example. Ironically,'Taken' (a French/United States co-production)is a film that fared far better in Europe than it has done over here (and also sadly). Neeson is a retired mercenary,who is taking some pretty crappy end of the stick,under the table jobs (security work for a trendy pop star,patterned obviously after Brittney Spears,minus the attitude,for example). His life is thrown into a quandary when his 17 year old daughter is kidnapped in Paris by a crime syndicate from eastern Europe,who captures attractive young women tourists,drugged & forced into prostitution. Our hero takes the first flight to France & opens up a can of whup ass on the baddies. Does he find his darling daughter? This is a high caliber,suspenseful thriller that will have you glued to your seat. There is talk that the European cut of this film is a bit longer than the one being distributed in the U.S.(perhaps when it finds release on DVD,the extra few minutes will be included). Despite the fact that this film carries a PG-13 rating by the goons at the MPAA,it has some salty language,lurid sexual & drug references,and a high body county,due to some fairly graphic violence that would have landed it an 'R',some years back (perhaps the American distributors slipped a nice,thick package of money under the door at the MPAA to buy themselves the PG-13 rating"

A lot of ""MacGyver"" moments, some car chases and cool spy stuff. I wouldn't say it always kept you guessing, but there were plenty of gasps and more than enough interesting bits throughout. I think what really impressed me is that there were REAL actors/stuntmen on film, moving about, no digital enhancement needed, and it looked great.

I could easily see this with someone else, Jean Claude Van Damme, in the lead as a direct to tape feature. When you look at Taken in that way, it deflates like a popped balloon. It all feels like warmed up Bourne leftovers. The worst part may be the condescending human trafficking angle which reminds me of stuff like Brokedown Palace or Fear. This movie could find it's way onto Lifetime for a heavy rotation. The best scene is in the trailer, when his daughter is kidnapped and Liam's character throws down the gauntlet.

The story is of an ex-CIA agent Brian Mills (Neeson) whose daughter travels to Paris with her best friend, who are both kidnapped. Mills uses all the skills he acquired in his job to travel to Paris to rescue her. And man, does he tear it up. If you don't like blood and violence, this probably isn't the movie for you. But I think any action movie fans will like this as much as any other. While there is a lot of violence, it doesn't seem like there's violence in this movie just for violence's sake. True, Mills does shoot and rough up people it seems he doesn't really need to, but I think it is just part of his character. 8 stars, and I'd watch it again."

","When I started watching this flick, I didn't knew what was in store for me. The initial 15 minutes of this movie deceived me into a family drama with the kid mad about going on a trip to France and her dad as usual reluctant about her lone travel with her friend. But this dad ain't a commoner nor is the dark secrets of the dangers lurking out there for the young women being alone.<br/><br/>Brian Mills (Liam Neeson) is a former spy and knows the risk of sending her daughter to France.

Brian Mills just have 96 hours to protect her beloved before she is lost forever as a sex slave. Will he be able to find her? What are the clues he have in store with him?<br/><br/>Taken is packed to the core with mind blowing action sequences thoroughly mixed together with an equally gripping screenplay and storyline. It has everything that a thriller movie requires: car chases, fist-fights, shootouts, stabbing etc. And these elements often reminded me of the Bourne Series while on play. Perhaps Taken was the only movie that I have ever seen, being the closest to the Jason Bourne series on it's thrill meter.<br/><br/>The 93 minutes of this movie were very absorbing! Perhaps they were the fastest of my life :-) ! Taken is a total entertainer. It's very thrilling to watch. But there was one niggling element in the movie. That was the background score.

","There are many implausibilities in evidence here, but in order to get an action pic to crank, you have to throw reality out the window. Reality and long pieces of action just don't go together. The average shootout lasts a couple of seconds. The average car chase doesn't involve massive amounts of collateral damage. Pierre Morel's thriller traces the kidnapping of Liam Neeson's daughter. Neeson, who has a shady background in international espionage, has a trick or two up his sleeve when it comes to dealing with bad guys. Naturally, he uses all those tricks to maim, chop, break and burn the kidnappers. That's the movie. It works because Morel shoots the action clearly. There isn't much breathing room and the violence is lovingly staged. Some family-size contrivances ruin some of the enjoyment, but the experience is relatively entertaining. Neeson has a great time killing and torturing those who done him wrong."

","Liam Neeson, one of the best talented veteran actors, gives a surprisingly good performance in this film. I never thought that Neeson could be so impressive in an action movie, up until now. Here he demonstrates a mastery of brutal action combat but also showing his softer side with one of the best line delivery in the entire film and with tight direction and class by the hands of Luc Besson. It's true that there are some cliché's in the film but it never overshadows the overall product. It also shows a brief glimpse of the human trafficking trade that's very seldom seem or even reported about in today's news and it's that aspect that I applaud the filmmakers for. I was a little letdown that the film doesn't dig too deeper into Neeson's character and the human trafficking trade so hopefully we'll see a director's cut in the future but for what it's worth this film is a blast and overall it's nice to see Neeson in a role we haven't seem him in before."

If you think by comparing the US with the average mid-European crime rate this must be a joke you're easily wronged by the fact that Mills daughter is kidnapped quicker upon her Paris arrival than the can say ""liberté"". <br/><br/>After that you're hardly surprised by a Frenchman bringing home a baguette at night and unshaved Albanians always having a beer can and a cigarette handy. <br/><br/>But if you can live with these black and white stereotypes you will see a highly entertaining movie and will also accept that even after all the debates about secret CIA-Prisons it's OK if Mills tortures a bad guy to death.<br/><br/>Besides these reactionary spillovers ""Taken"" is fun to watch, with Neeson who might seem miscast in a B-Movie is once again proving that he is still at the height of his career, delivering a solid Steven Seagal variation - including acting skills.<br/><br/>The fact that it was directed and written by French filmmakers with an Irish lead makes this bearable otherwise the pro American message would be too offensive.

The lead actor, Liam Neeson, has such a overwhelming presence on screen. He commands attention and respect with such authenticity. Contrast to other younger Hollywood pretty boys, he's what you would call a real man. In this case, he a father who's on a mission to bring back his daughter from the hands of smugglers. He's confident, extremely motivated, skillful and brutally straight to the point. The no nonsense take on screenplay, directing and acting has really impacted me like a punch right on the nose. There's no fancy bullet time tricks and high flying kicks, every hit is simple, effective, and cut right to the bone.<br/><br/>Being directed and written by Europeans also gives us a different perspective in portraying the European underground crime world. The underlying tone was pretty dark and desperate, pit the lone Liam Neeson against the world of evil. The grittiness of the reality helps intensify the emotion and make the bloody revenge more satisfying. This is not Guy Ritchie's British crime drama which was trifled with smart mouthing and comical coincidences. This is life or death, all or nothing. Bring back home my daughter, or die without ever seeing her again. On top of all these, this movie also has a break neck pacing. It draws you in right from the start and won't let go. It could be one of those rare movies that can be just as entertaining watching it the second time.<br/><br/>Go watch this movie, and have a good time."

","Taken uses the fear every parent has when their child leaves the protection of home. For most of us this fear is misplaced but occasionally it is justified. This simple premise is used with effect in this entertaining film. Liam Neeson is a convincing action hero even though he is middle aged. The plot is complicated enough to ring true but not so complicated as to interfere with the pace of the story. That said I think it could have been a better movie if there had been more of Neeson's character. What does the character do when confronted with such lawlessness? It's got to be more complicated to deal with intransigent ill will than is depicted in this film. I think this could have been mined for a more complex character study while maintaining the taught plot of the movie. This is one of my pet peeves about film making: it's always plot v character. Why does it have to be either/or?"

","Bryan Mills, a retired CIA operative, needs to set about tracking down his teenage daughter, Kim, after she and her friend are kidnapped by slave traders while traveling in Paris.<br/><br/>I must say now: This is an audience pleaser. The chances an average movie goer like you is going to not like this movie is very slim. With a mix of the Jason Bourne movies, ""Casino Royale,"" and ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" I found it entertaining as hell and the first kinetic, fantastic action movie this year. Who would've known Liam Neeson could play an action hero at this age?<br/><br/>The movie starts off really well. I almost teared up seeing the authentic father/daughter relationship. I'm just a sucker for those things. Minutes later, the action starts and the action in here is a little above par but not as good as you would think. The car chases aren't that great but overall, they're mindless enough for you not to care. Some scenes are just brutal, though, and one might think how this movie got away with a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson, as said earlier, does a great job as the next Jason Bourne looking for revenge. The directing job is pretty good too, along with the editing. Overall, there's nothing else to say. Will it entertain you? Hell, yes. Is this an amazing film? No, but it shouldn't matter."

","Liam Neeson is not the first actor who springs to mind when you think of movie action heroes. For a start he's 56 years old but why should that get in the way , look at Harrison Ford . The difference is Bryan Mills is no Indiana Jones! He's one guy you don't p**s off and for very good reason! <br/><br/>""Taken"" is ""24"" meets ""The Bourne Identity"". It stars Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills, a retired American spy whose daughter Kim (Maggie Grace from ""Lost"") is kidnapped in Paris while he's on the phone to her from Los Angeles. The kidnappers come on the line and Mills tries to warn them what they're letting themselves in for:<br/><br/>""I don't know who you are. If you're looking for ransom, I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills acquired over a very long career in the shadows, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that will be the end of it. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you. And I will kill you."" <br/><br/>But do they listen? Do they merde!<br/><br/>Now ,"" Taken "" really is a film that you have to turn of the logic side of your brain before you go into the Cinema. If you do that then your in for one hell of ride . It's action all the way and quite brutal action at times too. Neeson manages to kicks the butts of men half his age but somehow it works. He comes away from situations without a scratch while his enemies suffer thanks to his US military training. <br/><br/>If i had to criticise this film for anything it's not for the fact that it's ridiculously far fetched or the script is a little stiff its because of the way Neeson's Character reacts when his daughter say shes going on holiday to Europe to watch U2 . You would think that she just told her dad she was of to Beirut to join Hezbollah! Your much more likely to get into trouble in the big Cities of the US than in places like Paris or London. Personally i would have been more concerned that my daughter was listening to crap like U2!<br/><br/>But who am i to criticise as predictably daddy is proved right when she is whisked off by some nasty dark skinned Europeans before she's even unpacked!. <br/><br/>How have i survived all this time living and working in London!<br/><br/>That criticism aside i really enjoyed Taken. It's pure adrenaline packed entertainment and maybe we do have a new competitor to rival the three B's - Bond , Bourne & Bauer ?<br/><br/>I wouldn't say no to another portion of Bryan Mills and his no nonsense approach to life.<br/><br/>Good fun.<br/><br/>Taken is released in the US on January 30th 2009.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

Fine (but not spectacular) actings by neeson, grace and Kansan.

","First off, a word of warning for the movie-snobs who like inflating their egos by sneering at action films: suspension of disbelief is a prerequisite here.<br/><br/>That out of the way, and assuming the viewer possesses enough intelligence to judge a film for what it is, Taken will thrill, shock and most probably disturb the hell out of you, with its roller coaster ride of emotional appeals and horrific situations of which we can all empathize with.<br/><br/>That being said, the one thing you are most likely to experience with this movie is satisfaction.

Liam Neeson(who despite his excellent acting abilities cannot make 'taken' a good film, let alone an original film it's all been there and been done before!for instance it seems that this film shamefully rips off the famous chase scene from 'French Connection II' and even the aforementioned boat climax from 'Ashanti' the usual frenetic 'Bourne Identity' style of movie-making is ever present in this film one unfortunately with the horrible 'trend' to please the censor's 'Taken' also has alternate versions which no doubt are bloodier seedier, whatever! but the editor's scissors cant save this disaster of a film."

","Sunny Deol, I owe you an apology!!<br/><br/>When I saw you in Gadar single handedly fighting the entire Pakistani Army, I thought, Gadar did not deserve that much praise and money as it earned. Until I saw Taken.<br/><br/>SPOILERS ***************************************************** Taken is a Hollywood's reply to Bollywood. The basic premise is same - get a loved one (of ""weaker"" sex) captured by bad guys, then have our hero go overseas, fight the enemies and bring back the girl. Add to it, some mushy crap like a divorced father, a daughter who dumps a cheap gift by biological father over an expensive gift given by step dad, a teenager who has the latest phone but still is old fashioned enough to have a map in her bag with the journey route clearly marked on the map carelessly stashed in the bag so that dad can find it.<br/><br/>The entire movie is just an exercise to show the superhero antics of a middle aged Liam Neeson, who is intelligent than the entire Paris police crew. The enemies are stupid enough to trust a French police officer who speaks impeccable English with an American accent. If it is not the Russians, these time it is the Albanians and Arabs who are the bad guy. The hero breaks all the traffic rules to reach the target and yet not one police officer is able to catch him.<br/><br/>So if Taken can earn 8 stars on IMDb and generate millions of dollars in Box office revenue, why not Gadar?? If Liam Neeson can, why can't Sunny Deol?<br/><br/>Sorry again, Sunny!!"
"pivic","1","3","8","21 October 2012"," Xenophobic pap with bad script, soundtrack, character portrayals, etc.
","A complete xenophobic clown boat. I was prepared to see something action-y and fairly OK, but this went off the cliff from the start. To begin with, have no preconceptions of any kind of good cinematography, soundtrack, acting, script, character preparation, plot changes or anything that will stir the pot in this one. No imagination seems to have gone into this film, and that's another huge blow against Luc Besson, who actually co-wrote this mess. Where Liam Neeson goes on and on to kill, murder and maim people just to get hold of his daughter, there are a few other aspects here: foreigners are bad, kidnapping is bad, killing anybody to get hold of your kidnapped child is OK. This film has just interrupted the thinking process completely. I've got no qualms of watching brain-dead films, but when it comes to the point where you question the ethics that the film itself brings to life as there's just too much hypocrisy, it's just zany. Fawk this. Go watch some other action crap, it's most likely a lot better than this."

","I was very glad to see a large number of well written negative reviews about this really bad movie.<br/><br/>After watching this movie and seeing a very good actor play a scene where the hero tortures someone to death (leaves the room after turning the electricity on) and watching scene after scene of gratuitous violence played out in Segal or Stallone-like comic book style, I had to visit IMDb to see what the reviews were.<br/><br/>I like good action movies (Bourne series, for example). Those good movies have nothing to do with this movie.<br/><br/>Lesson: When evaluating IMDb movie reviews, start with the ""I hated it"" reviews and see if they make sense. In this case they mostly did. So I have nothing to add other than to emphasize how having the ""good"" guy torture someone to death just strikes me as bizarre. Shoot the bastard, OK? I almost turned off the movie (I had rented) after that scene but decided to continue watching, perhaps as a lesson to self to ask myself what is it about comic-book like violence that draws me, draws all of us, to some movie plots.<br/><br/>Yes, the age old good defeats evil theme can work.

"adamk-2","2","3","8","6 March 2011"," Bad, so bad.
","How bad? Holey, moley, where does one start? Well, how about the apparent message: Don't let you kids go to Europe, it's full of sleazy furrner flesh traffickers and corrupt cops. Let's then go on to the characterisation, including the bitchy ex-wife and the stupid and gormless daughter and her even more gormless best friend, not to mention Liam Neeson's uptight, obsessive, one-note performance which, as you are aware of his character's background and skills from the start, offers nothing in the way of growth or surprises, just added violence. And for the violence: I've no problem with violence, I like a bit of action, but the fight scenes reminded me of latter day Steve Siegal, with two protagonists happy-slapping each other, and a car chase in a quarry (a neat idea) which is basically almost identical white cars driving at speed and Neeson inexplicably coming out on top. Oh, and throw in those sleazy (and totally inept) furrners who fire multiple shots at Neeson, completely missing only for him to step out from behind a door frame and take them down with one or two well-placed shots -- I mean, ""Police Squad"" took the micky out of that one THIRTY YEARS ago. And the less said about the ""Escape from Peril"" scenario, which adds up to a ""and with one bound, he was free"" trick that died out in the Republic cliffhanging serials of the 40s, the better. Best of all, though, has to be the scene in which Liam Neeson penetrates the enemy lair in Paris by pretending to be a French(!) detective, and manages to fool them by not speaking any French at all or knowing anything about their set-up. Good points, to be fair: a surprisingly non-clichéd turn by Xander Berkeley as a not-at-all smug and slimy stepfather, and a really refreshing one from Gerard Watkins as one of the many Mr Bigs Neesom meets. After so many swarthy and unshaven villains, the light and civillised touch he brought to his role was a revelation, and to him went the best line of the film: ""Kill him quietly, I've got guests"".<br/><br/>But otherwise: Lord almighty, what a clichéd bunch of pants. Up next: Kenneth Branagh re-makes ""Death Wish""!"

It is so full of cliché as to make me wonder whether or not it had been written by a computer program. I can only imagine that Liam Neeson needed the money.<br/><br/>Polanski's Frantic has a similar plot (and location) and is a far superior product (whatever you think of the man's morals).<br/><br/>Noble estranged father, rich stepfather, spoiled daughter, corrupt French policeman, Albanian gangsters, Saudi Mr Big, car chases, gun battles ... they are all in there together with the revelation that Charles de Gaulle Airport is the world centre for white slaving.<br/><br/>Having said that, with its cardboard characters and puerile plot, this subBond action fest reminded me of the Saturday morning serials when I was a child. Every episode ended with a certain death cliffhanger, always resolved in about 30 seconds with an action sequence from which the hero emerged without a hair out of place."

","Overall I walked away from Taken with a feeling of satisfaction. The action was pleasing. It had its thrilling moments. And I always seem to be a sucker for watching Really Bad people get whats coming to them from someone operating outside society's rules. It turns out more clever than I thought it would be. If you like these things in a movie, check it out.<br/><br/>But beware. The road leading to this acceptable action romp paradise is one paved with Terrible writing, Campy dialog, and One-dimensional character development.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes of this film are really hard to sit through. The film is called Taken. Just get to the Takin' already. The set-up is completely unnecessary and poorly, poorly executed. As an audience, we can just assume that a father would want his daughter back. We don't need the background drama that he never gets to spend time with her and has revolved EVERY ounce of his life to being in hers. The way this came across, by the way, left me feeling unclean and disturbed. <br/><br/>The point being there is no reason for a movie called Taken to be unbalanced like this. Everyone who bought a ticket knows exactly whats in store for them and the fun is not going to begin until we see some kidnappin' happen. They could have just as easily started the movie off with the abduction scene from the trailer and given everyone some more thrills. We know that a father is going to do what he can to get his daughter back.<br/><br/>Also this movie participated in a strange phenomenon I've been realizing recently. Film with a videocassette look. Scenes of the movie, particularly action scenes have a grainy distortion all over looking a lot like it would if I was watching it off of a VCR cassette that had already faithfully served me at repeatedly recording the Simpsons a few dozen times. Very distracting, and really why mess with the beautiful high definition picture of film?"

Liam Neeson is a very good actor. <br/><br/>Now, the bad news. <br/><br/>1) Recently, action films have terrible editing. Why do filmmakers think action sequences are more exciting with choppy editing? (See Quantum of Solace and the second Bourne film). This film follows in that lousy tradition. The editing served to confuse, rather than enlighten. <br/><br/>2) Some serious lapses in logic in the film reminded me of 1970's action TV shows, a la Starsky and Hutch. Some examples:<br/><br/>-- when Neeson chases the bad guy up the ramp at the airport and causes a traffic jam, no drivers leave their car to see what's happening<br/><br/>-- when Neeson brings a girl back to his hotel room, he somehow acquired medicine, plastic tubing, an IV, a syringe to help her get better. Did he have these medical supplies stuffed down his pants? Did he stop and buy them?<br/><br/>-- when Neeson confronts the bad guys, he gives one of them a card that says ""Good Luck"" in Albanian, and asks the guy to translate it. How'd Neeson know that that was the guy he spoke to on the phone? <br/><br/>I don't know how some folks thought this was a good film, but it wasn't. Except for the acting, not really worth seeing."

","What a kick ass movie this was, Liam Neeson by rights is an excellent hero in my book. From various movies in the past including rob Roy, this was his best by far. And quite a martial artist too in fact. This was exhilarating to watch beginning to end, to have a father who goes to his daughters rescue in such a way that no one stands in his path. Not even so called friends from his life who would not help him. A ex secret preventer who uses methods to stop evil, he gets the results he needs with no mercy shown. To him his daughter means everything, and if scummy vile no good human traders get their just desserts, then so be it. Though in short comings it was sad to see his little girl see the world for what it really is, at seventeen it can obviously be a nightmare. But to have a father rescue his girl and to see her staring back into his eyes, was all worth it in the end. Because not only was he a preventer, he will always be a super hero to his little girl.

Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Femke Janssen.<br/><br/>The movie is about a young girl Kim (Maggie Grace) who just had her 17th birthday. Her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy) invites her to spend the week in Paris at her cousins apartment.<br/><br/>Her dad Bryan (Liam Neeson) who previous worked for the government, as what he states was a ""protector"", is skeptical about her going to Paris alone with her friend.<br/><br/>Eventually her father says yes, and allows her to go, with the exception that she must call him when she lands and every night before bed.<br/><br/>Once she arrives in Paris, while waiting in line for a taxi, Kim & Amanda are greeted by a young man named Peter (Nicolas Giraud) who asks them where they're from. He eventually asks them to share a taxi, as the taxi's in Paris are so expensive. Amanda takes leadership and says yes.<br/><br/>They arrive at her cousins apartment, and Peter invites the two to a party, which Amanda says yes to, also revealing to Peter and the unaware Kim that her cousins are actually in Spain, and they're home alone.<br/><br/>Once they get settled in the apartment, Kim confronts her friend about her cousins not being home, but doesn't seem to make that big a deal out of the situation.<br/><br/>Later her father calls her, and while on the phone with him, in the washroom, she witnesses her friend Amanda being abducted by 3 or 4 men.<br/><br/>Eventually Kim gets abducted too, and the film follows her father who travels to Paris doing everything necessary to get his daughter back.<br/><br/>Like my other reviews, I won't go into great detail about how the movie plays out or ends, as it's up for you to watch. But it's defiantly worth going to see, or buying."

The only potential need for imagination comes from the existence of the types of crime portrayed, and the almost unassailable fighting prowess by Neeson. I have to leave this with the comment that Neeson has been changed in my views to an equal of any action star, and from a childhood in the late 80's through mid nighties, I idolized the genre and have been shaped by it."

","This movie never stops. It is a relentless film about a father determined not to loose his daughter. In the opening this is in the form of quitting his job and life to be closed to her and her new family, however it is when she becomes the victim of some very bad guys overseas that his determination becomes raw for all to see. Definitely a violent movie along the lines of ""A History Of Violence"" and Charles Bronson's ""Death Wish"" series. Liam Neeson kicks butt and takes numbers through the entire movie and riding on audience empathy for his situation spares no one. Unlike many kidnap movies where the father-turned-rescuer is usually a regular man driven to extraordinary circumstances, here is an extraordinary man driven to an ordinary life that gets pulled back into what he does best, killing bad guys. In this sense the movie really rides the same wave as ""A History of Violence"" and if you like either one of them you are likely to like the other. Unlike ""A History..."" however, this film feels faster and reaches deeper into your guts. Like some other person said, the fastest 93 minutes you'll spend."

","I've just finished watching what I consider the most unpretentious action film I've seen this decade. The plot was tremendously well written, no glitches at all, it grabs the viewer from start to finish, in an amazing web of events, at the same time feeling so natural. You're introduced to a lot of violent scenes, but there's a sense of beauty to every one of them, like a skull crushing dance. Sometimes there's problem when you're dealing with some socially saddening subjects, but in this case, the whole human trafficking subject is treated in a very realistic way, no over-dramatisation. I was shocked (in an extremely good way) to find a Liam Neeson so powerful, yet so humble. I know it's kind of impossible, but I would seriously rather see an Oscar going to him, than a lot of so called ""actors"" that have received the ""honor"". All n' all, a great experience."

His character is so well structured, thanks to the brilliant mind of writer Luc besson who gave such classics as Leon, Taxi and transporter series. His screenplay moves at a pace where you cant turn back and ask yourself whether the events taking place are possible that is the strength on which this movie rides. its further polished when its given in the hands of a director made a cult action classic District B13 who just nails it shot after shot. if your ever wanted an action film that would blow your mind off this is it and i guarantee you its worth your time."

Liam Neeson plays a classic retired CIA agent who's been around the block and around the world while becoming more and more distant from his daughter who he now tries to devote as much time to as possible.<br/><br/>The story is that his daughter go's to Paris with her friend and they get kidnapped by Albanian human traffickers who plan to use and sell them to their ""unique clientèle"". It's up to Neeson to pull out his bag of spy skills and open up his can of whoop-ass to get his daughter back and punish the thugs responsible, which he does with the utmost frightening and merciless panache.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson's performance is expected. A great actor always delivers and Neeson topped my expectations. He'll look sad and weak in one scene then look bloodthirsty and yearning for vengeance in the next.<br/><br/>Only thing about the movie,which in one way is good and another way bad, is that it's very short. I wanted more but regardless, it kept me on the edge of my seat till the last minute, sort of like ""Phonebooth (2002)"".

After a short, moderately-paced setup, this movie accelerates until it goes at one million miles an hour, and it never lets up until the very end.<br/><br/>The action is Jason-Bourne style but so well done that it's almost better than in the Bourne movies. The bad guys are so bad you want them decimated, electrocuted, blown away and punched into submission so BAD - and you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>And yet, somehow, the story never loses it's emotional impact. It never veers into the ridiculous, the boring or the overly dramatic. The dialogue is awesome in its simplicity and effectiveness.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is very impressive - who knew he was an action hero? Steven Segal can only dream of a performance like this.<br/><br/>Luc Besson wrote this story and - miraculously - it seems there were no studio executives to mess with it.<br/><br/>Totally awesome."

I almost didn't watch the movie because Liam Neeson doing an action pic - I couldn't even think of it. But i gave him the benefit of doubt and he literally kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.<br/><br/>In retrospective - Liam Neeson was the perfect choice to play Bryan, the no nonsense, overprotective control-freak ex-CIA ""preventer"". But given what Bryan must've seen and ""preveted"" it makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>The movie introduces Bryan as a retired CIA Agent who wants to reconcile with his daughter after divorcing her mother. Having seen arguably the Scum of the earth he becomes overprotective of his only daughter who lives with her mom and her new ""rich"" step-dad. So when his daughter wants to take off for vacation in Paris her father is reluctant to sign the permission. It doesn't take long for her and her best friend to get into trouble in Paris - they'll get kidnapped the very first day in France. As fate wants it Daddy is on the phone when the 2 girls get taken by the Albanian Mob. Bryan having not lost his instincts keeps it composed and tells the Kidnapper via phone - to either let his girl go or be killed when he finds him. The mobster - not knowing what kinda trouble he will be in - tells him ""Good luck"". Using his old contacts Bryan is informed that he only has a 96hr window to find his daughter or never see her again.

It is a bit like Steven Segal, but without the pointless violence and the beer belly(the violence has a point here!).<br/><br/>Superbly directed action flick, it dispensed with characters and story very fast and got on with what every testosterone-filled male was waiting for: lots of great action. The action is much better portrayed than in the Bourne films, it's a sort of a cross-over between them and the Segal/Bruce Lee films (with a dash on Ronin on top).<br/><br/>Must see for any man/boy more then 12 years old.<br/><br/>If only they had cast a real actor instead of the Muppet that Liam is this might have had a 10."
"mickey-tighe","10","3","8","6 October 2008"," awesome movie!!
","Neeson is awesome in this movie. Famke Janssen provides the eye-candy! (hot!) Great plot, keeps you interested all the way through the movie. A must in a movie of this nature is a believable storyline, and in my opinion, this is perfect. A father loses his daughter to the bad guys, kicks ass and takes names, gets his daughter back. But doesn't get back with the estranged wife (Which would have been predictable) at the end. Each character is supplied with sufficient background information so that it doesn't seem as though John Doe from LA/New York/London has just taken on and defeated the entire world. Neeson convinces the audience that he can, and will, do whatever it takes to rescue his daughter. Brilliance. Although I, in my opinion, doubt it will get an Oscar, because the movie is not about World Peace or some other random political rambling. Great work by Liam Neeson and (fairly new director) Pierre Morel. Great Casting, great direction. In all, a great movie. Miss it at your peril!!!"
"the_crow007","9","3","8","22 August 2008"," A Must See Movie. Way Better than The Dark Knight!!
","First of all let me start by saying that those of you who thought ""The Dark Knight"" was a great action flick, then you obviously do not know much of what a real action flick means. And those of you do not think that ""Taken"" was an entertaining film, well you do not know the meaning of entertainment. You would probably end up giving a boring depressing film like ""Bridge to Terabithia"" or ""The Thin Red Line"" which both had no base, no path and no justified ending a 10 star rating on the grounds of being 'depressingly' entertaining, but would probably give ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" a one star based on an unrealistic plot, excessive violence and entertaining.<br/><br/>""Taken"" is a brilliant movie from the start. The movie character development was well crafted as it gives you an insight of what the characters nature are like. This was typified with Liam Neeson's character Bryan who killed people as a profession prior to retirement but deep down inside there was humanity inside of him. He loved his daughter greatly and regrets of not spending much time with her while she was growing up. But furthermore, it depicted the length a parent will go in order to ensure the safety of their child regardless of whether the child is an adult or not.<br/><br/>The action side of ""Taken"" was of high class. The fight scenes were well choreographed and it gave a sense of ""Bourne Identity"" type of edge to it. Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen who are the writers for ""Taken"" did a great job with the script. It was a fast paced film, with suspense, action, thrills, touch of humour but most important of all a realistic plot. Sure some areas within the film seemed far fetched, like shooting the police chief's wife in the shoulder and not being caught, but within the film it contains a very important message. That is sex slave trading does exist.<br/><br/>Lets face it slave trading or sex trading of people do exist in this world. Unfortunately our governments are more concerned with blowing up countries where the leaders do not have any weapons of mass destruction, rather than worry about the illegal sex trade that go on within their own backyard. For those people who are involved in those type of illegal work deserve to be shot dead in cold blood with no question asked. They are a disgrace to society and humanity.<br/><br/>Overall ""Taken"" would have to be the action film of the year so far. Way better than ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Indiana Jones & the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". Others like me have felt a feel good feeling inside after watching the film. The money spent on ticket not going to waste.<br/><br/>A must see film."
"ciaranroberts","10","3","8","9 August 2008"," The film delivers
","First of all this is my first review on IMDb but there will be more so thank you for reading.<br/><br/>If your a fan of fast paced action thrillers with sentiment thrown in for good measure,then my friends you have arrived! Neeson delivers in a well written high octane thriller that will leave any red blooded male with a tingle surging through his body. The acting and delivery is brilliant which is a credit to the casting directors and producers. We get enough content and character background to have sympathy for our hero and find ourselves throwing imaginary punches with every brutal stroke. The fight scenes are well choreographed and action is fast paced. At no point did I ever feel the film had hit that wall that so many other titles in this genre hit. We are allowed to enjoy a solid story, a believable premise and some very enjoyable acting from all concerned. <br/><br/>The Story without giving it away is about a former US government spy that must come out of retirement to save save his Daughter. I left the plot brief and wrote the above comments first because most people, including myself switch off after hearing this type of plot. So what makes this film different? The acting and dialog for a start, they go hand in hand, no line or action in this film is thrown away. The direction and story are very compelling but I have to admit without Liam Neeson I may have well overlooked this little gem. I gave this a 10 not because it was the best film i had ever seen but because I know that at the box office it will be overlooked. It will in my opinion become a DVD seller and get many of its fans from this base.<br/><br/>I give this film a 10 in the hopes it not be overlooked however I am one man with one vote. I hope my hollowed cries do not fall on deaf ears, this film deserves a loyal and steady fan base. Real mark 7/10"

"kneiss1","1","5","17","29 June 2010"," Even Rambo is cooler.
","While the action and the actors are good, this movie lacks everything else that makes a good movie for me. If you don't care about a good story, and like expensive action, I am sure you'll be happy with this movie.<br/><br/>As mentioned, I am not happy with the story. The story is as simple as you can imagine. Not only is it simple, it has zero depth and yet it is still full of goofs. Pretty much all that happens in this movie is, that Neesen is running through Paris slaughtering one evil gangster after another. On that way, simply everyone, even innocent people, are shot, hit or kicked. The movie barely cares about morals. Even less than Rambo. (And I am no fan of Rambo.) The moral of the story probably comes down to this: You may kill everyone for the American dream! (Especially non-Americans? Because only foreigners have been killed in this movie.)<br/><br/>I am no moralist, and I totally don't want to be one when it comes to art. Maybe I would have liked this movie if Neesen would have been drawn a bit more evil. Most of the time he is looking like some shiny hero. (Especailly in the pathetic 08/15 Hollywood-ending.) And for me that is simply totally absurd. Psychological there is no realism in this movie. - And isn't the psychological aspect in stories the most interesting? <br/><br/>Everything in this movie feels as if you have seen it before. Visually it's boring. The conversations and characters are stereotypical. There are no new ideas, totally nothing interesting. There isn't one moment in this movie that will force you to think. There is no: Uh, what did just happen now?"" Not even an: Oh, I am so interested in what will happen next."" <br/><br/>Objective I should rate this movie higher (maybe with a 2 or 3), subjective I have no other choice but to give this movie 1 point. I can't remember any movie that angered me in a similar way."

"webmaster-3330","2","5","18","23 February 2009"," Incredibly lame
","""Taken"" has some well-done action scenes, which might look excitingly new to younger viewers. Besides that, it's a story-telling nightmare and a slap in the face of anyone who appreciates brains in an action movie - even when their not all over the screen.<br/><br/>Most notably the movie fails miserably at creating any kind of credibility - not to mention empathy - for the main character. Desperately trying to portray him as the rejected father who gave up the job that he loved so he can be close to his spoiled daughter the film makes Liam Neeson's character Mills look like nothing but a gigantic loser. He gets pushed around by his horrible daughter and his even worse ex-wife. Why would he ever try to help either of them? And why should I care if he succeeds or not? After 15 Minutes I have absolutely no idea, but somehow I am still willing to see where this goes.<br/><br/>To make a long story-telling nightmare short: It all goes terribly wrong. For example, we are forced to witness Mills as some sort of Jack Bauer's clumsy brother-in-law who thinks he's tough because it's said to run in the gene pool. Did the creators really believe that 24 is suspenseful because Bauer has a gun and uses a lot of high-end spy technology? Why else would they show Mills' aging ex-colleague at his home computer telling him the name and birthplace of his daughter's high-jacker based on some sort of pathetic voice analysis? No offense, but this scene is just pitiful. At another point Mills finds out that his daughter lied to him to get permission to go to Paris. He just waves her good-bye and doesn't do anything about it. Once more I am left to wonder: Why should I care for this person when his problem is not losing his daughter but - excuse my French - having already lost his balls and brains? At this point all I can think of is the 8 Euros that I paid to watch this.<br/><br/>We then (more or less) follow Mills on his point- and brainless killing-spree through Paris encountering extremely flat and moronic enemies (yes, including the stereotypical evil bureaucrat). In the end he finds his daughter being sold to the son of a sheik. I mean really: How bad is this? How can you so openly exploit the most simple-minded resentments and enemy concepts for your dramatic purposes - and think you get away with it? Especially after these concepts have so eagerly been used in real life and politics over the last years? Sorry, I'm not against shooting people in movies but based on this, it just makes me sick.<br/><br/>In the end Mills gets his daughter back and takes her to singing lessons while I struggle to find out what this movie is trying to tell me. The world is a bad place so don't travel? Don't go to Paris, become the generic version of Britney Spears instead? Don't stand up for yourself but save your daughter's bottom however stupid she acts? Or was ""Taken"" intended to be some sort of parody on American paranoia? I honestly don't know. If so, it failed. If not, it's just pathetic."

Father and daughter relationship then daughter got kidnapped. That is the only emotional hook this movie can offer. Another strength of this movie is the action although there's too many cliché moves around it. Reminds me of Steven Seagal. Compare this movie to Bourne, this movie is like a rat and Bourne is a horse.<br/><br/>Apart from all those strengths, the movie has some major weaknesses. Maggie Grace can't act. The script was badly written. The character building was too brief. If it wasn't for the fact that Kim is the daughter of Bryan Mills, I wouldn't care if she got kidnapped. Like how I didn't care that Amanda got kidnapped or raped too because who the is she? She just appeared for a few minutes and got kidnapped.

Right after arrival she meets her charming kidnapper- hours later she's violently dragged off her suite. That's what happens when a young girl travels through the dark old continent.<br/><br/>Her father: her saviour. He kicks ass. One guy dares to help a villain that gets beaten to a pulp in public. He instantly gets pounded as well. He's black: probably an accomplice of that Albanian scum Neeson just hunted down. Liam Neeson shows us what a real hero looks like. An all American father in 'Lone Star'-mode.<br/><br/>Of course Albnanians are the villains, yet we meet an interesting mix of other participants in these foul deeds done. Most are more or less characterized by nation or culture. Albanians only do the dirty work of course. All the other mistrusted yet more cultivated folks play their parts respectively. If it weren't about selling women we might not even hate them as much. As it is however we see them for what they are: non-human. Fit to be hunted down and killed in broad daylight, without asking twice. Torture and everything. Well done by our hero. A pity he could not rescue all those probably eastern European girls he rushed by while on his mission. Sedated as they were it would have been hard to do I guess. And after all his goal is saving his daughter. I mean: they made it his business.

As such, the film 'Taken' is not worthy of it's Blockbuster reputation. <br/><br/>The film's pace is a speedily one, that goes by so damn fast that you don't even have time to process any of the information that the film throws at you. This requires a second viewing. Therefore the only people who can catch up are the hardiest of action-goers. Also, you're viewing it, wondering 'where did the last five minutes go?' At that point, you're already lost in the horrid, butchered editing, till you find yourself pausing it to take a breather. The pace also does not give way to the films dialog. Some of the dialog is great, but it fails to catch up with the actors that speak it. Again, another example of butchered film editing. The film goes from a meaningful drama, to a let's-go-and-ruin-and-destroy-everything. Where the action thrives from speedily boat chases to fist crunching sequences, suffering long and hard of 'shaky camera syndrome'. But the action overwhelms our protagonist so god damn much that it reaches a point where there is no story, and our characters get lost in the midst of all the explosions and foreign gibberish.<br/><br/>The film's story line is one massive plot hole in itself. What are the odds, that; The daughter kidnapped ('Kim') just happened to be the daughter of an ex-CIA agent. What are the odds that sex traffickers, just happened to kidnap the daughter of a kick-ass CIA full-time father? And what are the odds that she was kidnapped at the time she was on the phone to her father? And what are the beckoning odds, that they were kidnapped on the very same day as their arrival? (IN-cluding the evil taxi driver that drove them to their apartment) Questions like these don't match up. The film's story line is so damn focused on the action and combat choreography that it doesn't concentrate on the reason it's being made in the first place. Creating more questions than answers is possibly the worst thing a storyline can do, at this point.<br/><br/>Oh, there's also no character development. Liam Neeson misses some great opportunities to grow into his character. As it seems, he's so focused on smashing guys up and finding his daughter that perhaps he gets lost in his own motif. Nobody has character development. Giving the certain situation, there's all the more reason for us to fall in love with our characters. <br/><br/>In summary, it's a worthless film with jaw-aching action with an eyesore pace."
"wilks4428","2","2","5","26 June 2012"," Why do people like this movie?
","The reception that this movie has received over the years is unbelievable to me. All too often when I challenge someone to name a second film Liam Neeson was in that is worth watching (the one film being Schindler's List) and I'll always hear ""Taken's a great movie"". This is perhaps the worst action film I have ever seen. The lines delivered are positively horrible and the actual fighting is preposterous. One user stated that fans of the Bourne series would enjoy this film as the action scenes are shot similarly. Whether or not this is true, a young, fit Matt Damon doesn't look nearly as ridiculous flipping ""bad guys"" over his back while spin- kicking another as an aging Neeson does. While action films often don't need to be believable to be enjoyable, Taken makes a few attempts to be taken seriously as a meaningful film, which are out of place and laughable. Don't see this movie."
"garwhite44","2","2","5","8 November 2011"," Modern racism perfectly exemplified
","Im not certain how its possible that so many people can give glowing reviews to this. To me such a high score on such an overwhelmingly mediocre film is ludicrous. I like a good action film, i quite enjoy Neesons acting usually, but this is horrible. I guess it makes sense that people like Pierre Morel and Luc Besson will continue to make loads of money cranking out this predictable, formulaic, demeaning and regressing cinema so why stop? I guess i would do the same. I wont go into the plot because there are some really fantastic reviews already (apparently there ARE people who have sense out there) that sum it up perfectly. Essentially UTTER crap, tripe, funny and horrifying but only when its not trying to be. Actually maybe i will go on, bear with me... i promise this is an accurate description. Before i continue i have to say that if you happen to be a student of sociology, or if your interested in understanding modern or historical racism then this movie actually has merit; but only as a study or example of how racism still exists everywhere in our world. Especially in the US. Seriously, its terrible to see that people think this raises some sort of awareness about human trafficking, once again other reviews have tackled this already but i must throw my lot in with the rest. Its too bad that people around the world have to put up with these stereotyped ""threats to America"", the crooked police (with a friggen baguette under his arm!), the Muslim/Albanian/UNAMERICAN (thats the point) who wants to take your daughter, give her drugs, rape her and then sell her to Muslims.... It exists sure enough, and its terrible of course, but this is neither appropriate or needed in this medium. French are stereotyped as incapable and crooked, Albanians as fat greasy ugly rapists (don't forget the drugs) who are apparently also really bad at what they do. I was about to go on but to this point i'll just say that this film is ignorant, and RACIST. ""Damn we should have listened to Liam!!""the daughter thinks it, the wife thinks it, the step husband thinks it, the crooked police think it.... did i miss anyone? oh yeah, the abductors think it of course ""he said he was coming... i sure underestimated that American""<br/><br/>Fine, hes superman and captain America in one, happens enough in movies and frankly not a big deal... but the tracking of the mobsters? c'mon... if your going to make him a secret agent you can actually create some justification as to how he is so bloody competent at finding people in a foreign country, but no they don't bother because then the writers might have to take two minutes to look at the storyboard, all we know is hes superman. Why leave every girl? if your superman you might as well take 2 minutes to do some good... he hurdled every other seemingly impossible obstacle easily enough.... No emotion from daughter or dad at death of friend? what about the parents? what about the OTHER GIRLS??? Where'd the methadone come from and why didn't they simply give us a reason for Neesons superman status? This in-of-itself is why the movie is so horrifyingly bad, they could easily throw two lines in explaining some of the less believable scenes but they don't! <br/><br/>IM ANGRY AND CONFUSED, mainly at how its possible that this received such a high rating. This is the best example i can think of right now of the worst movie ever made, for many many reasons. <br/><br/>All of you who think this is good or relevant to a human trafficking discourse, or that its good for awareness of the topic should seriously get some sense and, i mean this, feel ashamed. The money doesn't go to trying to stop human trafficking, it goes towards the house, cars, and meals of the already FAT Luc Bisson.<br/><br/>Its not the fact that this movie was made that gets me, there are always poor decisions being made for all the wrong reasons all around the world... its the fact that what i thought was a community of (for the most part) intelligent and conscious movie goers is not. <br/><br/>Respect your movies, don't put up with this garbage. Most of all respect the victims of a real and horrifying problem in our world: don't support this cinematic-diarrhea."

","If your not drawn to this film by it's simple trailer of the phone call between the characters played by Maggie Grace and Liam Nieson, you yourself need a recharge of the batteries.<br/><br/>The film starts of simply enough with the character of Bryan Mills on a quest to buy a karaoke machine for his daughter's birthday. He pours over the instructions, just to make sure the item is good enough for his daughter.<br/><br/>However, he's somewhat estranged from his family, despite the fact that he's giving up the career that took him away for so long. After an awkward moment where he delivers the gift, he's called upon by a friend played by Leland Orser (of Runaway Jury)to work security at a concert of a Britney SPears type diva.<br/><br/>The next day, Mills drops his daughter off for her trip to Paris, where he is told that she and her friend Amanda are merely going there to check out the Muesuems.<br/><br/>Instead, they hope to follow US on tour. Alas, a encounter with a runner for a group of thugs who kidnap young girls for sex slavery marks them, and they are later kidnapped. As they kidnap Mills daughter and her friend, he advises them to let his daughter go, or else he'd come looking for them.<br/><br/>And looking for them is what he does. After the runner is killed trying to escape Mills, Mills embarks on a twisted and sorted journey filled with seedy characters, and friends ready to betray him. After he finally gets his hands on Victor, the kidnap groups leader, he is set to find those who know have his daughter.<br/><br/>Vengeance is served by the character of Bryan Mills, as he eliminates the organizers of this group, until it ends in an epic battle aboard a yacht.<br/><br/>The Villains are rightfully chilling and ruthless. Mills is honorable, as a Charles Bronson style assassin. The Bryan Mills character doesn't use catch phrases, or fancy moves. Instead of being superman, he's presented as a father who has just the right set of skills to rescue his daughter, and perhaps, bring down the network.<br/><br/>Taken should have gotten more praise then it was given. This film is a sleeper of a gem that supplies the right balance of action, melodrama, and overall heart that is what makes it different then many actions films made today. A truly excellent film, rated 10 out of a possible 10."

","Taken is a very serious action movie involving fist fights, gun fights, car chases. I was very impressed by Liam Neeson's acting and especially his fighting-style, it's amazing how he can take down 10 opponents with his body. Famke Janssen was alright in this movie but I could see that she was just uncomfortable with her role. Man, when she cried I laughed.<br/><br/>The story is about this retired agent whose daughter gets kids kidnapped by men with a tenacity for trafficking women. The news shocks him to the bone but it's all a piece of cake for him. He only has to put his life on the line, who cares! Well anyway I enjoyed this movie for it's action and story. The only thing that I hated about this movie is the shortness of it. The movie was an hour and twenty-nine minutes but it seemed like thirty minutes. I guess I must have been enjoying it so much.<br/><br/>I plan to watch more movies by the director, Pierre Morel, and that just shows how much I really liked with this movie.<br/><br/>Story: 8.0 Acting: 6.9 Action: 9.0 Overall: 9.0<br/><br/>SPOILER!!!!!!

The fight sequences are so raw much like Bond(Daniel Craig not those pansies from before) and Bourne but here he beats over 40 men with his bare hands and the dude is not in his early 30ies.The boat part might just be the best fight i have ever seen and most realistic which is very hard to come by..Did i mention i watched it 3 times IN A ROW.Only one part vexed me the Albanian guy was named Marko and that is not an Albanian name.Albanians are Muslim and Marko is a Christian name"
"Kristinartist79","10","2","5","28 March 2009"," Interesting movie and I don't usually like actions
","My friend saw this movie and recommended it; she said it was a good movie for young girls to see. I am not into actions and I am not at that age of meeting strange men (or strangers in general) or traveling with a wild friends and getting into mischief but it was very interesting and kept me hooked! It does teach a lesson on not trusting people who might seem charming; even if you don't picture yourself in a situation like this, it teaching a lesson on trusting people in general and it teaching a lesson on not doing anything you do not feel uncomfortable with. The main character's mean mother convinces the father to allow her to go on the trip; he agrees as long as she calls him and there is a guardian (which the friend thinks there is, as her friend said her cousin would be there) Spoilers: When the girls arrived to France and shared a cab with these charming men, her friend tells them where they are staying. The main character seems skeptical and implies to her friend that she shouldn't have done that, but she's like, its fine! She also realized her friend lied that her adult cousin would be there. Her father calls and she confides to him that there are not adults on the trip but kind of tells him its all fine; then she witnesses her friend being kidnapped and tells her father; his daughter gets kidnapped shortly after, while on the phone, but the father goes to France immediately to save her. The whole film is fast paste and interesting! Unfortunately her friend died, but her father saved her."
"a_chan","10","2","5","22 February 2009"," Neeson does a 'Bourne' and is better than Bond
","TAKEN was the best action film in the UK in the Autumn of 2008. Liam Neeson was a credible and exciting action man and the kitchen scene when he 'reveals' himself to the kidnappers was one of those visceral cinematic moments when you have to shout out 'GET SOME!' because you know there's gonna be an ass kicking bad style! Forget about the ludicrous plotting, the film does everything it says on the 'box'and is an enjoyable Euro thriller. Accept the film at that level and you won't be disappointed. It's better than Quantum of Solace! I disagree about comments over Neeson's acting. The fact is, he is totally credible as a one man demolition squad. If he wasn't, the film simply wouldn't work. Neeson reinvents himself as an action man in the same way that Nicholas Cage did so in Con Air. Watch out for more chop socky from Neeson in the future, perhaps as a baddie, even a Bond villain!! Remember, you read it here first."

Liam Neeson is a great actor, but who would have thought he is a cold hearted, martial arts, street smart action hero (and loving father). Yes there are many stereotypes in this story (I will not go into it as it has already been discussed) but this is a movie.....hello.....movie everybody. I enjoyed every minute of it for a very simple reason. All this movie wanted to be was a simple and good action movie.....mission accomplished. It is fast paced, nobody is trying to make you feel sorry for their actions and at the end I was jumping on my couch (just like Tom) when he finished the bad guy at the end. Nowadays we do get too many thrillers and action movies that want to save the world, and the whales, and somehow go off track. TAKEN never swayed of the track for one tiny millimeter and I would go as far as calling this the best action movie in the last 5 years. Jason Bourne......you have been served."

The movie also arouse a major problem of slave trading which start to grow more & more now adays, you will be asking yourself throughout the whole movie what would happen to his daughter, with a lot other examples of other girls being kidnapped also, & I see that this is the main point of the movie; a message to everyone who's in control who could do anything to start hunting down those people, & a message to every parent, to take more care of their children.

A great surprise to see as this film has not been heavily promoted - much like 'Death Sentence' with Kevin Bacon in 2007.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson seems an unlikely hero at first but his natural and unassuming approach make his performance appear real, raw and most importantly, convincing.

The only reason this goes from 10 to 9 is because there is so much action that the character development wanes a bit, but I PROMISE, you will not care.<br/><br/>There is nothing original about the plot. There are no Oscar worthy performances(Neeson is great though).

Taken is one that I'll be adding to the library. The most fun I've had watching a popcorn action flick in years.<br/><br/>Simple premise. A little cheesy to start. Then foot on the gas.<br/><br/>Fammke and some of the other cast bring it down a notch but from minute 25 to minute 90 you'll be on the edge of your seat.

"Otoboke","Null","2","5","20 October 2008"," Something for the aficionados.
","As a critic, to draw comparisons between Taken and the James Bond series would be like taking a gun and shooting yourself in your foot, and so I must continue on with this review in a limp. While this latest effort from director Pierre Morel isn't exactly as compelling or engaging as most of Mr. Bond's movies, what it does have in common is a riveting mix of action that runs on adrenaline and kicks with personality; of course, Liam Neeson is hardly a James Bond type, and quite frankly, neither is his character, but the trials and tribulations that Bryan goes through here share the same sense of personal conflict that often occurs during the best Spy-Thrillers. This isn't a movie riddled with politics, evil villains looking for world domination or fancy gadgets. No, instead Morel adopts a much more grounded, everyday threat to work with here, and as such achieves a good sense of focus and pacing that drives the feature forward. Unfortunately, despite this keen eye for bringing action that we care about to the screen, the script's lack of just about anything else hinders the movie's ability to work anything but the brain. It can be touching, but only momentarily; Taken is fine for a couple of hours of thrilling mystery, but if you crave more than a six-pack, you're probably best waiting for a martini.<br/><br/>Telling the story of an ex-spy and father Bryan, who is on the hunt for his daughter's kidnappers in France, Taken takes a much more domestic, heart-driven source of narrative to drive itself forward. Compelled only to find his enemies for the sake of saving her daughter within a contrived timeline before she gets sent somewhere out of his reach and knowledge, Bryan makes for a cold, unrelenting character to follow. Throughout the feature, Neeson proves he has what it takes to fulfil such shoes, conveying the abrasive, goal-driven attitude of his character with enough conviction to maintain our own interest in his story. Of course, when it comes to showing how he feels outside of a piece of combat however, both Neeson and his persona fall a little short.<br/><br/>Bryan is a regretful father, who in the past neglected his ex-wife and daughter in order to be good at his job. Yet realising how much bonding time he lost in doing so, decided to quit his job in order to move closer, and spend time with his daughter. In this arc there is genuine sympathy to be felt for Bryan, and Neeson does enough to get this across, even if he is far more compelling when firing off a weapon and breaking people's bones. The closing sequences are where the majority of all this development does finally pay off however, in an emotive climax that provides adequate catharsis involving the two central characters. However compelling such moments are though, there is no denying that the majority of Taken is driven by pure logic and visceral action; moments involving the heart are sporadic and almost immediately forgotten, and as such, the movie's tone can get a little erratic at times.<br/><br/>As a whole, the feature isn't as remarkable as it could have been, but it is in no way disappointing either. Instead Taken takes a much more focused route, and delivers a spy-thriller that delivers on all the elements needed to create tension, conflict and does so with a character that is convincing in his role as a source of unrelenting pain for those who have crossed him. Those looking for a taste for the genre before Bond comes out should find themselves at home here, and while Taken is certainly a lot darker, more grounded and at the same time, less charismatic than cinematic icon 007, there's enough action and plot here to justify a watch. Perhaps with a little deeper characterisation the production as a whole could have been stronger, but for what it is, Taken is pretty much standard for the genre; no too remarkable but not too disposable either; something for the aficionados.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

Liam Neeson is damn good in the role of the father, who will do everything he can, to find his daughter. He really surprised me with all that good action stunts he pulled off (in the end,he is 56 years old so I wasn't expecting too much in the beginning-I was very,very wrong).<br/><br/>So in the end,I ain't gonna tell you anything else about this movie because I don't want to risk and spoil you watching it.

The action sequences aren't too long & unbelievably they're believable. If you like action, a decent storyline to hold it all together and a fresh face for a new bad-ass then this movie's for you.

We get sentiment and we get violence, and we get super-creepy father/daughter scenes, that made my toes curl. Across his career, Luc Besson vacillates between almost passable escapism (Fifth Element) and utterly unredeemable dreck (Big Blue, Subway, Leon) The script is so bare-bones that it results in laugh-out-loud developments. 45 minutes after lading in Paris, a girl is kidnapped for a Euro-prostitution ring? Um, yeah. And you can identify a single criminal in Europe from two words spoken into a phone! Liam Neeson passes himself off as a French agent without speaking French or having an accent. Terrific.

","Ouch! <br/><br/>An hour gone by since leaving the theater and I am still recovering from the painful, excruciating 93 minute experience called TAKEN; A film so weak, and terrible from plot to script, to flow, to acting, that I cannot bear to hash over the detail. If you are debating on whether to see it, or if you should trust the high IMDb score, help yourselves and trust me: wait for it to appear on free cable.<br/><br/>TAKEN lacks depth at all levels, and it pains me to slam it like this. Honestly, I am torn. Liam Neeson is one of my favorite actors and I'd like to give any movie he is in props just for having him in it. But I can't do it for Taken. The only reason I did not walk out of the theater is that I believed - hoped, there was a good reason for an actor of Neeson's depth, and resume of riches, to contract for such drivel.<br/><br/>But there is something bigger here than my opinion of this movie: the high IMDb score noted above. <br/><br/>I read several of the very favorable reviews and found them suspiciously lopsided, and written with unnatural professionalism. All I can think is either: a) I just don't get this movie and something is wrong with me; or b) IMDb has been corrupted by a vast Hollywood conspiracy.<br/><br/>Here's my theory: the economic recession has turned the porn industry flaccid, leaving a great swath of affordable real estate in the San Fernando Valley, and leagues of unemployed writers willing to ""work for food"", in this case: sign a non-disclosure agreement and write fraudulent reviews to falsely inflate IMDb scores and deceive moviegoers, driving them to see films, rent DVDs etc, all for the benefit of those along the money chain. <br/><br/>Unlike some of the other mediocre reviews, I cannot even give high marks for the action or fight choreography. Yes there's lots of it. But it's so over-the-top, with Neeson going virtually unscratched after dodging a thousand bullets and countless mano-a-mano encounters, it is just silly. <br/><br/>So, Mr. Neeson, please forgive me, and please get busy on Rob Roy: the Golden Years."

I confess that I have high standards for films, and I expect a little effort in the scriptwriting department.<br/><br/>For people who have one or two brain cells to keep their ears warm with, this film is very boring. The film equivalent of paisley wallpaper.<br/><br/>For those who just want a mindless action film masquerading as a thriller, go for it, but don't expect anything that hasn't already been done a thousand times since the mid 70's. Stephen Segal has done the same stuff for years, and in a more entertaining way."

","After his daughter is kidnapped, a CIA agent goes after the bad guys with a vengeance. It is interesting that writer Bresson receives before the title screen credit because the script here is atrocious, nearly as bad as his ""La Femme Nikita."" It starts off as merely sub-par in the expository scenes, where the cardboard characters are introduced, including a 17- year-old daughter who looks about 25 and behaves like 12. Then the kidnapping occurs and the film becomes increasingly ridiculous. Neeson single-handedly takes out about seven hundred bad guys in Paris while barely getting a scratch on himself. And he does this with a straight face. The guy makes James Bond look like a wimp."

He was prepared for everything and knew what to do all the time. That is not a real person. I found myself hating the main character, i mean c'mon he shot his old friends innocent wife!?! How is he supposed to be the 'good' guy?? Sure it was all to get his daughter back but did he really feel the need to shoot every single person that had any remote connection with his daughter?<br/><br/>Nothing interesting happened the entire length of this film. Pretty much the guys daughter gets taken and he shoots everyone until he gets to her. None of the hundred deaths is he connected to, instead they all go home and live happily ever. The end."

","Taken Is a dramatic and interesting movie about a spy's daughter getting kidnapped while she's in France. Maggie Grace (LOST, The Fog, Suburban Girl, Jane Austin Book Club) is a little on the ""Little Kid"" side for her age and height but her performance as a scared and worried teenager who is being held hostage was amazing. Liam Neeson (Star Wars) is a spy who will do anything to get his daughter back. He lets nothing stand in his way. When I went to go see this I was shocked... He was bigger and badder than James Bond. I thought I was going to the movies to see my favorite actress ex LOST Survivor (Maggie Grace) and I thought O wow it's going to be another boring film with just a pretty face in it. Boy was I wrong. This movie is a MUST SEE. I suggest that everyone goes and gets them a copy of this movie when it comes out on DVD. Taken Has such a good supporting Cast such as.. Famke Janssen (X - Men 1,2,3).

","Yea though I would never have expected to see Liam Neeson in an action flick, he does a spectacular job playing the role of an ex-CIA preventor. He has a natural knack for action as he is long and lithe allowing for intense hand to hand combat as well as fast paced running.<br/><br/>The story line is somewhat meager, but is sufficient to warrant the viewer the ability to sit still until the next action scene pops up.<br/><br/>Neeson definitely beats out most other actors in action and shows his undying prowess in Hollywood.<br/><br/>All the way up till the end, ""Taken"" keeps the viewer on the edge of his/her seat and barely leaves one wanting more.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This movie will remind you of Man of Fire and the Bourne series in one. This movie is fast paced and has kills and fights every minute. Liam is relentless and unforgiving. If I had to pick something bad the first ten minutes does foreshadow way too much, but once the action starts it's FIRST rate. Now why I'm mad: This movie was supposed to be released in September 2008. For unknown reasons FOX studios pushed it to January 2009, which for those of you who don't know, January and February are the ""Dump Months"". This is the time when production studios dump the movie's they know are flops or don't expect any money from. FOX are idiots. In my opinion this movie would have been one of the top three action films of 2008, but it's being completely disrespected with the likes of Paul Blart and Bride wars. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Liam Nieson is a bad ass, the plot is original and the action is up there with the Bourne series. It's awesome to see a good guy who'll hurt ANYBODY to win. Liam doesn't hesitate which is a rare thing to see in good guys. Go see it. Go see it. Go see it."

Truly a great action movie that keeps your attention on it all the time, because you don't wanna miss on the action scenes.<br/><br/>This is one of the those movies, where you just know whats gonna happen. People are gonna get killed, hurt and probably a few explosions. While the plot isn't the best, its simple, thats why its a good movie. There's a good balance on on getting to know the different characters, but its only quick introductions. Any one who's seen a more than 5 movies in their lives, doesn't need the whole life story of each of the characters. You just get a idea of who, what, where and why... and then the movie starts.<br/><br/>Liam Nesson plays well in it. Retired spec ops? Liam? nooo, really? He was the right pick for the lead role, and he delivers very well. You can almost sense he's got a lot of war stories and the skills to keep doing what he was trained to do.<br/><br/>Just a quick note for all the ""i hate it"" Just whining about the movie containing Stereotypes... OH the big Americans just do this and that blah blah... Doesn't most movies contain stereotypes? French director and writer and producer? Got a problem with Americans? Go whine to the french then(no im not American)<br/><br/>Then a lot of you saying its trying to be like Bond or Bourne? Perhaps... then again, i love to see somebody kick ass.

","This was a pleasant change to the ordinary plot line that this genre usually calls for.<br/><br/>This movie had me at the edge of my seat from start to finish. It is one of those vengeance movies where the audience is left with a great satisfaction after the villain is slayed.<br/><br/>Just like all feel good movies you need to have a wider range of imagination when dealing with the plot... such as, when the protagonist is fighting a million villains... needless to say, he will prevail.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I thought this was a good thriller and action movie. It felt as if all the characters involved had substance to them. Not like your usual thriller. Obviously, this is not a very deep and emotional movie but given the constraints I felt that Neeson gave a very good performance, at least what his character called for. Everyone pretty much painted a very clear picture of the characters except maybe for the step dad. I felt that his character was too empty. But then, this is a thriller, and after such a nice hour and a half, I might be asking for too much."

","I love it when an action film has a solid plot, decent acting and tons of great action. If you liked the movie Seraphim Falls and you enjoyed Liam Neeson's character then you will love this film! A previous reviewer compared Taken to the Bourne films and complained that it could've been better. I agree as some of the supporting acting was terrible however I personally detest the political nature of the Bourne films.<br/><br/>The great thing about Taken is that it has no socio-political agenda. Liam Neeson's character is solely focused on saving his daughter and will do anything to accomplish his mission whether it means killing or torturing those who get in his way.<br/><br/>Towards the end the action gets a little unbelievable however nothing that deters from the enjoyment of the movie. My biggest problem with this film is Maggie Grace's horrible acting as Liam Neeson's daughter.<br/><br/>Taken, is a typical Luc Besson action film that cares very little about character development and strives to provide the best action and cinematography possible. And in that sense this film is a major success! <br/><br/>I gave this film 10/10 stars because it embodies what I look for in an action film--intense action, gripping suspense and absolutely no socio-political agenda!"

The main character is so driven and determined to get his daughter back that its a joy to see him shoot and fight his way through his enemies.

So it had to be refreshing in some ways, but no not at all. So many awful stereotypes and plot qliches its hard to watch. The American girls are just so.. blah! His daughter and her friend are so stupid and spoiled (And Follow A U2 Tour in Europe! so thats what the kids do these days!) You don't give a darn about them. Liam Neeson doesn't really even have to act, he has two emotion tones in the whole movie. The suspense is awful and predictable. The acting is terrible besides Neeson's mediocre role as a mad dad.

He has made some pretty bad movies since then, but he's also made some good ones, so you can't really blame him for being a little overzealous with the roles that he's accepted since this hit-role he' had.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie is very good... They kidnap his daughter and he goes on a rampage...

The teenage daughter of ""Bryan Mills"" goes on vacation with her best friend to stay in France but almost immediately are captured & by evil Sex-trafficking scum & then that sets in motion a violent quest for Bryan Mills to hunt & kill those responsible.
Famke Janssen plays the ex-wife of Bryan Mills & mother to their teenage Girl played by Maggie Grace & the grizzled Neeson gives a fantastic angry & deadly performance as Bryan Mills & uses his skills to track & exterminate the vile scum who do this stuff & the action is brutal tense & gritty with Neeson even torturing some of the scum to get the answers he wants!!!
I loved Neeson here & wish there was guys like him really out there killing off the evil scum of the world as they all deserve to die in my opinion!!!<br/><br/>""TAKEN"" is a tight & tense dark Action Thriller with an Awesome Neeson taking out the trash!!!

","There are a few movies that I watch whenever they're available, over and over again. Taken is one of them. There are numerous reasons. One thing that stands out is that unlike most films of this genera there's no long-winded soliloquies by the protagonist. When he has to shoot, as Tuco said in The Good, The Bad abd The Ugly, ""if you're going to shoot, then shoot! Don't talk, shoot!"" A fast paced, we'll written, well directed screenplay.

"zkonedog","8","1","2","12 March 2017"," Jack Bauer: The Retirement Years
","While watching ""Taken"", the first thing that crossed my mind was: ""Wow, this could be the story of fictional TV character Jack Bauer's retirement years!"". Considering the success of 24, suffice it to say that I mean that as a compliment and thoroughly enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>Basically, the plot of this film centers on Liam Neeson's character, who is estranged from his daughter (played by Maggie Grace) and really has no way back into her life anymore. Though tenuous about her decision to travel to Europe for a summer with a friend, he knows that not signing the consent form will only further drive a wedge between them, so he allows it. Of course, her and the friend are immediately targeted by European slave traders and kidnapped right out of their apartment, sending Neeson into action to try and get them back. The kicker, though, is that ""Neeson"", now retired, was once a government agent who worked for an agency not unlike that of ""CTU"" of ""24"" fame (at least that is how it is described). As a result, Neeson actually has a fair shot at tracking down his daughter's abductors for the remainder of the movie.<br/><br/>What really separates this movie from other action fare, though, is the character development at the very beginning. Where other pure action films (Eagle Eye comes to mind) spend just a few precious minutes to develop the characters, the entire first 30 minutes (out of only 90 total) of ""Taken"" really fleshes out the father-daughter relationship. This makes you the viewer root even harder for Neeson cause when his daughter is taken.<br/><br/>The acting is also very solid, albeit in a subdued fashion (at least from Neeson). Whereas Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer emotes wildly and often, Neeson's take on ""government agent"" is much more simmeringly intense. We understand how badly he wants his daughter back, but he doesn't have to pitch a fit to convince us. Also, Grace (""Shannon"" of LOST fame) transitions from well from small to big screen, as her innocent portrayal of a young girl also helps the audience become emotionally involved with the film.<br/><br/>Thus, while this film is not epic in any sense of the word (hence the four-star rating), it is still very entertaining in a straight-forward sort of way by doing all the things that a good film should: developing characters, creating emotional attachments, and having enough of a plot to keep the action moving forward. If you are a fan of the ""thriller"" genre, please check this movie out...it may not shoot straight to the top of your ""favorite movies"" list, but you will also likely not be disappointed, either."

I thought I would forgive the ludicrous premise if it resulted in a good 'thriller' type film. Unfortunately it didn't. A film-by-numbers pushing standard buttons; Americans good, Europe dangerous, Fremch weaselly, Albanians all crooks and Arabs decadent. A waste of time. Still I am sure Liam Neeson and Famke Janssen (both of whom I normally like) got a decent pay-day so it's not all bad. P.S. travelled and realised are not mis-spelt. Line 9 is here.

Liam wore nice shoes, people who abducted her daughter wore nice shoes too, good job by the people dressing the actors, what is the word costimographers.<br/><br/>The plot is a standard action film with some parental involvement. Selling virgins to the rich Arabs? I do not know it is a little bit clichÃ©... Too much blood and too many dead people, I did not like that much violence...It is not very realistic plot. I do not like that.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is fabulous like he always is. Other actors are excellent as well, especially actors acting Albanians.<br/><br/>Paris is beautiful like it always is. I am glad that this film is focusing on waves of East Europeans and other foreigners coming to find luck in Paris, and finding corruption and problems. Paris has no room for all those who want to find happiness in it. Parisiennes hate foreigners and other French people. The only thing they want to see is the seaside and skiing twice a year.

"GalileoSmith","6","1","2","5 October 2013"," Highly Unlikely Thriller
","My theory is that most thrillers, perhaps only the best thrillers have any chance of being remotely plausible or realistic. If a thriller were actually plausible, some real-life bad guy would have already figured out the would-be plot device. At that point it could not be a thriller simply because it would already have become national news.<br/><br/>Taken is not a great thriller. It looks pretty good, and Liam Neeson does his best at knocking guys out, but underneath it all it is a silly movie. The film is slightly more serious about itself when compared to the Die Hard movies, but other than that, they seem a lot alike.<br/><br/>Thrillers do not have to be endless machine guns bursts, car wrecks, and fiery explosions, they really don't. One of my favorites is The French Connection. But don't get me wrong; Taken has its place. I mean, the idea is to give some thrills and raise the pulse. Taken does that. But you have to suspend most thought and all logic to get maximum effect."

What I say is this success of the mission depends on too many special objective factors, in other words, the director provides the mission too many sort of lucky factors to make it successful.<br/><br/>The girl gets a millionaire stepfather, who has a private plane. So it doesn't take too long to cross the ocean. Then it's her spy father's turn. I'm not sure if it is too lucky for Bryan or it is too stupid of the criminals that the girls phone is still there. And then what a lucky guy Bryan is again that he catches the trafficker in the airport.

","Liam Neesom at his best in this action adventure movie. I have never seen a movie where Neesom has had a bad role. His toughness is what really makes the movies more interesting to watch. I have seen him in Satisfaction and that was an okay movie but he really dons out the action films much better. What caught my attraction in this film, is the way he took charge and that he took nothing that stood in his way to find his daughter. I think any human being whether mother, father, grandparents, brothers or sisters would do exactly what he did in this film. He was fascinating in Taken and I am looking forward to watching Taken 2."

","It was probably one of the best surprises i've seen in my life. I expected a good movie but not that good. I remember as Liam Neeson played cool characters like Schindler in ""Schindler's List"", but i didn't expected to a character very fast to fight and ready to all to save his daughter. The movie is only one hour and half which doesn't make the film long or boring, not at all. It seems difficult to be bored when watching this movie. I think actors like Sylvester Stallone and Jean Claude Van Damme have a rival now. If you are looking for an action movie which takes places outside the USA, with the idea of revenge, Taken is the movie you need to watch."
"adhdimaginations","10","1","2","21 June 2012"," Incredible Movie ***SPOILERS***
","I have seen this movie 4 times, I own it, and its amazing. This movie never gets old. The acting is so amazing, the plot is so intense, and the action is so incredible. I love Liam Neeson, I thought that he did an incredible job in this movie, and even though he's getting up there in age, he still knows how to fight!!! I enjoy this movie more than the Bourne series or even the Bond series, because of its intensity. The only thing I thought was lame is that when Liam saves his daughter in the end, the daughter is fine and dandy when they return home and Liam has no consequences from killing so many people. If the girl went through being addicted to drugs and sex trafficking, she would be changed for life. She would become a depressed and disturbed girl and not some happy, joyous daddy's girl. But other than that, the movie is incredible and definitely worth watching. I can't wait for Taken 2, coming out soon. It is going to be just as intense and great as the first film!!!"

","This 90 minute action movie keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole time wondering what will be the next course of action. Liam Neeson very well portrays the role of a caring father and an ex-spy who has some very great skills. The direction is very good and the editing is razor sharp. Not even one scene where the viewer can complain of it being unnecessary. The action sequences are mind blowing and more importantly, the hand-to-hand combat has been extremely well done. The way Liam Neeson finds each link looks so genuine. The two car chase scenes are also a treat to watch. All in all it's an awesome movie. This kind of cinema comes with great effort and hard work. My only complain, if I can put it that way is that the movie should have been a little longer so we could have more of it."
"whatsup216-340-878279","10","1","2","10 April 2012"," Liam Neeson with a vengeance
","Liam Neeson stars as an ex CIA operative that is forced to come out of retirement in order to find his daughter after she is kidnapped in Paris. I was excited by the previews and was hoping for a good action film that I could also relate to. I found it in this movie. I like to get personally involved and it didn't hurt that I was about the same age as the daughter when I saw the movie.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie, which I'm sure if you are watching because you want action, would probably be boring for the action junkie. I, however, liked it. It allowed me time to get to know the characters and the dynamics between the characters. For me, this makes the movie much more enjoyable. And for those action junkies, it didn't last long before the action started.<br/><br/>Liam plays the part of Brian Mills whose main goal is to rekindle his relationship with his teenage daughter. He was a workaholic who neglected his family and ruined his marriage but is determined to keep that one connection with his daughter Kim, played by Maggie Grace. I didn't feel she was the perfect fit for this role. She was too old to be playing a 17 year old girl. But, while an important role, it was still a small part in the film so it worked OK. <br/><br/>Kim wanted to spend the summer in Europe with her 19 year old friend. Liam (Brian) is not happy with the idea but was just beginning to develop a relationship with his daughter and didn't want to ruin it before it flourished, so he agreed. The first day in Paris they were kidnapped. The directors were excellent in the construction of the abduction scene. It was intense. The whole scene was set from the the daughter's perspective while she was on the phone with her dad. It really builds the suspense and sense of dread. The directors did an excellent job with setting up several of the scenes in this movie and it is their ingenuity as well as Liam's acting skills that make this movie great.<br/><br/>The abduction is where the action starts and it doesn't let up throughout the entire movie. Liam Neeson is perfectly cast in this role and proceeds to blaze a trail of blood, bodies and even a little torture in the process of finding his daughter. I also feel that Liam is a great talent and is underused by Hollywood.<br/><br/>The action scenes are staged well and highly entertaining. It also had good lighting. I hate watching movies when you are somewhat guessing at what is happening because the lighting is too dark. I pay good money to watch someone else's imagination at work. I don't want to have to use mine.<br/><br/>After talking to a few friends about their opinion on the movie, the only thing we agreed on is that Liam Neeson is great and that there is enough action to keep you entertained. One person felt it was morally questionable with all Europeans and middle easterners as bad and only Americans as good. Another person felt that it put women in a poor light without any control over their own lives i.e. kidnapped by men and saved by men. I felt it was a well-constructed action film where the directors used their imagination to make the scenes unique and suspenseful. I would see it again. In fact I already have."

","I decided to write this review now, after seeing this movie for about the 100th time, why? Because of some of the reviews on here that make NO sense what so ever. Namely: TechStuph.. Trust me, I get it, we all have different opinions we are entitled to, and freedom of speech allows us to print it.. However, this movie kicks ass! I mean this flick is NON stop action from start to finish... I am not saying you have to like this movie but if you are going to call out ""plot holes"" than your ""call outs"" should at least make sense...<br/><br/>First off, you call out the fact that the kidnappers choose to grab the girls by breaking in to a 5th floor apartment.. Why not grab them from this ""party"" they were supposed to go to? Well, how about the fact that would be out in public? Perhaps they would be seen? Perhaps others would try to help the girls? What happens if ,from when they were dropped off, to when this party was supposed to happen, they changed their minds? Say they decided to leave and go out? You question his accent, yet the kidnappers are not Irish or French.. They are Albanian and do not speak French, so I would guess it didn't really phase them.. Not to mention, why would they ask? He had his card, knew where they conducted business and knew about their deal with the French Government. I am not sure what you are referring to on top of the roof"" and ""traitor""? He states that he can't leave, that his daughter is running out of time, that it was not a building it was a trailer (referring to when he broke the girl out wearing his Daughters jacket).. I don't hear anything about him being a traitor? And, it is not mindless, The sex trade is a very real issue in Europe, which is why I found this movie convincing. If you are going to call plot lines out at least think it through.. This flick kicks butt.."

","""Taken"" was an AWESOME movie. I saw this, and if you ever felt frustrated by the evils of the world, this is the film for you. Truly a great action movie that keeps your attention on it all the time, because you don't wanna miss on the action scenes.<br/><br/>This is one of the those movies, where you just know whats gonna happen. Bad guys who deserve it are gonna get killed, hurt and probably a few explosions. While the plot isn't the best, its simple, thats why its a good movie. There's a good balance on on getting to know the different characters, but its only quick introductions. Any one who's seen a more than 5 movies in their lives, doesn't need the whole life story of each of the characters. You just get a idea of who, what, where and why... and then the movie starts.<br/><br/>Liam Nesson plays well in it. Retired spec ops? Liam? nooo, really? He was the right pick for the lead role, and he delivers very well. You can almost sense he's got a lot of war stories and the skills to keep doing what he was trained to do.<br/><br/>Just a quick note for all the ""i hate it"" Just whining about the movie containing Stereotypes... Don't most movies contain stereotypes? French director and writer and producer? Hey, at least they get it.<br/><br/>Then a lot of you saying its trying to be like Bond or Bourne? Perhaps... then again, i love to see somebody kick ass. So yea this movie is for people that love that. If not... stick to Quantum of Solace. Thats a real movie... about feelings and how the world can be a better place..."
"WilderMovieReviews","10","1","2","19 March 2012"," This film ranks in the top films I have ever seen.
","I saw the trailer for this film a few months before its release. I can't remember looking forward to a film so much from just seeing the trailer. The Trailer set the film up perfectly. By the time I finally got to see it, my expectations were so high I knew I would be disappointed. Wow was I wrong.<br/><br/>The film starts off well, good introductions to the key characters. Bryan's daughter manipulating her parents into allowing her to go the Paris with her friend. She makes the promise to call at regular intervals. A promise that is broken almost immediately. Her father, played excellently by Liam Neeson, finally gets to speak to her on the phone. During this time the house she is staying in is broken into and she sees her friend being attacked. She lets her father know what is happening. He tells her to hide under the bed. Then, shockingly he tells her that she will be taken. His prediction is right and after she is taken one of the abductors finds the phone and hears her father telling them that he will find them and kill them. The abductor wishes him luck and hangs up the phone.<br/><br/>This is also the main part of the trailer. What grabbed me was the way Neeson spoke to the abductor. You would expect panic and anger, but no. He speaks to him in the calmest voice you will ever hear. This tone is frightening. You totally believe that this man will carry out his threat. And he does so with such style and believability. You find out he has Special Forces training and he puts them to use in dispatching everyone in his way. But unlike classic action films, the way he does it I found to be very believable. Everything he does is calculated and no energy is wasted. There are no crazy drawn out gunfights, no spectacular martial arts fight scenes. What you get is believable, he takes out people in his way quickly and efficiently.<br/><br/>Neeson is perfect in this role, not a typical action star, but he pulls the role off effortlessly. You believe in his character and when the film ended I found myself wanting more. For me this is what movies should be about.<br/><br/>The film is written by Luc Besson, a master in this kind of film.<br/><br/>This film ranks in the top films I have ever seen along with Leon: The Professional also by Luc Besson."
"nicole_ward","10","1","2","4 February 2012"," Wow.
","I can't believe it took me so long to watch this film! It had never caught my eye until a friend gave me it to watch. I am so happy they did, as this is now one of my favourite films. The acting from Liam Neeson is perfect. He plays his part so well, and makes this film what it is.<br/><br/>The action scenes throughout are great and not too fake or 'cheesy' as I sometimes find with some films. The storyline is also very good and is very moving.<br/><br/>One of the main things I loved about Taken, is the fact that it doesn't take too long to get into it. The beginning is good and kept me interested unlike some films which just take too long to get into, with a very boring start. <br/><br/>I am so happy I finally watched this film, and would recommend anyone thinking of, to do so as soon as possible. Definitely worth it!"
"Siamois","7","1","2","20 December 2011"," Entertaining
","When his daughter is kidnapped abroad, a former CIA operative follows the trail of a sex trade ring and stops at nothing to find her.<br/><br/>Taken walks the fine line between ""true action movie"" entertainment and a a grim thriller. The formula works although there are times when you wish director Morel had made a clear choice between the two.<br/><br/>The movie starts well, establishing ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills as a flawed father with the best of intentions. And once his daughter is kidnapped (during a brilliant iconic scene involving a call between Mills and his daughter) the tension rises considerably. The action sequences impress early on and some people have compared them to the Bourne franchise.<br/><br/>However, the body count starts to pile up at rate that is hard to swallow when the feel and tone of the movie seems like a thriller or procedural flick. This is not Die Hard or Lethal Weapon where you expect a fun romp filled with humor and extravagant scenes and yet, the movie cannot be viewed in a serious tone as Mills leave a huge trail of killing and destruction behind him.<br/><br/>Likewise, the sex slave ring angle gives a grim tone to the entire movie but Taken never fully explores that aspect, keeping the movie fast and furious. The second half of the flick stretches the confine of realism but without ever becoming tongue-in-cheek. Liam Neeson is perfect as Mills but the rest of the cast sleepwalks through the film. Casting Maggie Grace (25 year old during filming) as Mills' 17 year old daughter is very questionable to me. So this is really a Neeson one-man show.<br/><br/>All in all, this is packaged as a tense thriller but is really just a good old action movie where the plot does not make much sense. There is nothing wrong with that but, with a tighter plot and an extra 15 minutes of character development, it could have been an even better movie.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"
"markbishop1994","7","1","2","9 December 2011"," Awesome Movie! Not bad for a Frenchman!
","I was introduced to this film by a Friend who let me borrow the DVD. I didn't have many expectations for this film and I wasn't much of a fan of Neeson having seen very little of him.<br/><br/>The film was absolutely fantastic, it is action packed and never left me feeling bored at any stage. It starts with Bryan Mills (Neeson) seeming fairly pathetic at the starts as he attempts to improve his relationship with his daughter. It soon becomes apparent however that he is more than just an ordinary father when he has to use his 'special set of skills'.<br/><br/>I recommend this film wholeheartedly, If you like action films or Liam Neeson then you have to watch this!"
"bless-them-67-548423","10","1","2","30 May 2011"," THE most adrenaline driving film
","The film drove my adrenaline right to the roof. The theme about human trafficking is great, it makes people aware of this real issue. However, the film is more about the Liam Neeson's revenge, he did an absolutely wonderful job in his role and let us see how would he save his daughter at any cost. My favourite lines in this film are: 'I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you'. The film perfectly illustrates how Liam achieved his promises to the kidnappers, and he achieved it exceptionally. However, the only downside is that the actress of the daughter wasn't delivering very decent performances in this film. Overall, I would still rate it 10 out of 10, definitely a must see film if you love Liam Neeson and revenge films. I initially wasn't attracted to see this film by itself but rather Liam Neeson since I have previously watched his Unknown which was also a great one! Love Taken and Liam!!!"
"mr_pivac1985","10","1","2","17 April 2011"," Fantastic film, loved it, best film of 2008
","Liam Neeson was great in this movie. At times I was reminded of John McClane and Jason Bourne characters, but with more seriousness & focus. As happens with many films of this genre, you have to suspend your belief somewhat as this quasi-superhero appears bulletproof!<br/><br/>Some intermittent subtitles could have fleshed out the bad guys characters a little, making them less one dimensional without detracting from the suspense, while keeping the audience in the loop.<br/><br/>A miscast Maggie Grace tried to downplay her age without success. Watching her run was reminiscent of a baby giraffe taking it's first steps. There are many younger actresses out there who can play the ingénue more convincingly. <br/><br/>The violence can be gruesome and the sex-trade scenes sickening. But overall, this movie delivers and is well worth watching."
"oneguyrambling","8","1","2","8 April 2011"," Reminds you why mindless 80s action flicks were so much fun.
","Check this out as a recipe for an awesome action flick.<br/><br/>1. Brian loves his jailbait daughter.<br/><br/>2. Someone takes his jailbait daughter and puts her in great danger.<br/><br/>3. Brian f*cks them all up.<br/><br/>Awesome right?<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is Brian, a recently retired man who once performed top secret tasks for someone or other, it's all very hush-hush ""I could tell you but I'd have to"" stuff.<br/><br/>He had retired to be near – and to get to know – his daughter Kim from a former marriage to Lenore (Famke Janssen) who has since remarried to Mr Moneybags.<br/><br/>When 17 year old Kim goes to Paris for a holiday Brian is reluctant to let her go unescorted but is ""convinced"" to allow it rather than risk another setback in his rebuilding of his daughter's trust.<br/><br/>25 minutes into the film his daughter is Taken.<br/><br/>Why Kim is taken (she's hot jailbait), why she was in Paris (a U2 tour) and what might happen to her (sold into prostitution) are largely irrelevant in the big picture, what is important is how Brian might react and how he might choose to solve the dilemma<br/><br/>27 minutes into the film Brian gives the following speech to an unseen and unknown man on the other end of his daughter's phone:<br/><br/>""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.""<br/><br/>Well that clears that up.<br/><br/>From that point on all logic and reality goes out the window. That's a good thing by the way – this is a vengeance film not a science project. It is not his only speech in the film but it is the best, setting up a hectic non-stop last hour that sees a body count that tops 30. Easily.<br/><br/>Off to Paris we go. Shortly after ""the speech"" Brian meets a French policeman that he once worked alongside and is told ""Try not to make a mess!"", well if he tried he certainly didn't try very hard.<br/><br/>What follows includes – but is not limited to – the following;<br/><br/>* Brian beats up two guys in broad daylight outside a major airport (one dies) and nothing happens, he walks away. Glad they stepped up the airport security post 9/11!<br/><br/>* Brian finds the bad guys within 24 hours, dispatching many.<br/><br/>* Brian finds the headquarters of the entire woman smuggling operation in 48, stopping only presumably for a Red Bull every now and then – he dispatches many more and finds time for a little torture to spice things up.<br/><br/>* Brian shoots a very nice (innocent) woman – who has just cooked him dinner! To make a point, then on parting says ""Please apologise to your wife for me"".<br/><br/>* Brian finds the Rich White Guy within 72 hours (the Rush Hour films might cop some stick but the claim that there is a Rich White Guy behind every major crime operation holds water in film after film).<br/><br/>* Brian sets off on foot and keeps pace with a car over a short distance – then steals said car and needs to race full bore for over 2 minutes to keep up with a river boat that had maybe a 30 second head start. Abandon logic when you can fit another car chase into the film!<br/><br/>Taken has the aforementioned high body count, some running gun battles, multiple car chases and some pretty nifty and brutal hand to hand combat. This is no action-comedy either, Liam and co play it all straight-arrow from start to finish – ain't a damn thing funny here!<br/><br/>Fortunately being a movie set in France where the hero hunts a bunch of Albanians everyone manages to speak English 95% of the time. Taken is by no means a masterpiece, but you'll watch a lot of similar films before you see a 90 minute vengeance film that keeps the pulse pounding and the eyes wide open as good as this one.<br/><br/>By the way – Here is a film where EVERYONE is wrong but Brian. The ex-wife, the daughter, the bad guys and the cops all make claims that prove to be FOS, Taken is the ultimate ""I told you so"" film.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 8 / 10. After making him go to Paris and kill a few dozen strangers I sincerely hope Brian at least grounded Kim for a week! At least he saved her from attending a single U2 concert."
"poolandrews","5","1","2","7 March 2011"," Decent action thriller.
","Taken starts in Los Angeles where former hardened spy Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) attends his daughter Kim's (Maggie Grace) seventeenth birthday party, separated from Kim's mother Lenore (Famke Janssen) he tries to stay close to Kim & involved in her life. Kim ask's her father to sign documents that will allow her to travel alone with her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy) to Paris & throughout Europe, at first Bryan is hesitant to sign the papers but finally agrees. Once in Paris the two girls are kidnapped by Albanian gangsters who specialise in prostitution & the slave trade, Bryan manages to fly to Paris & uses his contacts to obtain the information he needs & sets about finding his daughter Kim & saving from a life of drugged up prostitution & dishing out a little revenge on the way...<br/><br/>This American, English & French co-production was directed Pierre Morel & is a very gritty action thriller that is almost great but not quite, while it has some good action scenes & a solid plot I thought it lacked a little something & I ended up wanting a bit more. The script takes itself very seriously & the overall film has a gritty feel, there's no one-liners or messing around here when Bryan goes in he goes in hard & fast with no messing. The central concept is ever so slightly racist as the idea that Europe is dangerous & your liable to get kidnapped & sold into prostitution is a little overplayed, the other central theme of the unity of the family & that nothing else matters is rather broad. The bad guy's keep changing, from a guy at an airport to Alabanian pimps to mega rich oil sheiks, Bryan brings them all down in the end though. At about 90 minutes in length Taken moves along at a decent pace & there's enough shoot-outs, fights & action to keep one entertained but I didn't find any of it particularly memorable. The character's are alright but I found the coldness of Bryan played by Liam Neeson distracting & I didn't like it at all, even the other character's are a little thin.<br/><br/>Available in an Uncut Internationa version & an edited US theatrical edition there's a couple of minutes of difference between the two but nothing that noticeable. The action scenes are good, they are swift & fairly brutal without any prolonged fights or shoot-outs, if Bryan wants to kill someone he just kills them. There's a decent car chase through a building site too.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $25,000,000 this ended up being a big box-office just about everywhere it was released, filmed in Paris & Los Angeles. The acting is OK, as I said I didn't like Neeson's cold performance at all though. Australian pop singer Holly Valance turns up as a pop singer.<br/><br/>Taken is a solid action thriller with a tough gritty edge, I can't say it's particularly original but is good for what it is. Action fans should like it & definitely worth a watch."

","This had everything and more, such a simple story yet so beautifully told on screen. Hat's off to the director and screenplay, the editing was sharp yet so smooth throughout. Composition and soundtrack were perfect from scene to scene. The fundamental aspect of a father's love for his daughter isn't shown anywhere else as well defined as it is here.<br/><br/>I have to say I did have a lot of preconceived notions walking into this picture. Stuff like: well its Liam Neeson - the man is known for his iconic role in Schindler's List but can you really picture a father in his 50s still kicking ass in an action film? how wrong i was.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were choreographed so well and once again, smoothly edited like i said earlier. Taken really captivates your imagination when there are those quiet sombre moments and thrills the excitement of stepping into unknown territory. Camera shots have to be praised for being so darn clever in capturing long sort after details in a matter of seconds. That way you know where the story is going instead of being thrown randomly into a ""Day 2"" or a ""3 weeks later"" scenario.<br/><br/>Taken is on the edge, fast paced and script worthy enough to be published as a book.

Liam Neeson is kinda like Swarshinager in Commando, by that I mean that their both trying to find their daughter who has been kidnapped.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie, and I know I'm not alone, but it isn't perfect. some parts of the film were a bit boring and tedious. And I tried understanding what was going on, but the plot was so confusing it lost me in a few places. Like I said, this is entertaining, just don't try to find any hidden messages."

","This was an excellent example of how the gritty and seedy underground of how women are taken out of existence by slave traders. Liam Neeson plays a retired government agent who is trained in the most prestigious and complex forms of martial arts as well as weapons. Trying to find his daughter who was taken by a group of Albanians while on vacation with her best friend. Yet in order for him to complete his search, he needs the help of a questionable french fellow agent who sits behind a desk. Giving Liam's character small clues is more than enough to find his daughter. But finds out his friend is also involved but at a very small level. This causes his search to escalate to disastrous results, hitting small hooker barns to taking out a slave trading cell on his own. Leading his way to the nerve centre of the Albanian source. And a fat disgusting sahib who craves very young girls including his daughter who was sold for the highest price at an auction. With interpol and other factions on his heels looking for him, nothing gets in the way of dad and his little girls freedom from the most vile organization on earth. Brilliant performance from Liam Neeson. He's even better than 007. To the point, gets results, and doesn't waste time with every skirt who carries a gun under her dress. This is how an agent does his work."

","Preparing to see Mel Gibson's latest flick, which draws plot elements from 2008's TAKEN, got me thinking again about TAKEN. Liam Neeson, who is not the first person one thinks of as an action hero, plays an aging CIA spook whose daughter is kidnapped while vacationing overseas. Neeson immediately takes off after the bad guys and eliminates them one by one during his search. The movie is satisfyingly violent, although it was inexplicably trimmed for American audiences (go to youtube for a much grittier and more satisfying version of the electric shock interrogation scene). The fights are simply amazing, and Neeson looks pretty damn agile for an old hoss. He also gets to beat up on bad guys of several different ethnicities, including our pals from the Middle East. I hope the Gibson flick is half as good. It is rated R, and one can only hope it will be a hard R. If you see TAKEN, try to catch the European version."

However, no sooner do the two girls land in Paris then they are snatched by a sinister gang of thugs.<br/><br/>Fortunately, just before the abduction, the daughter was on her cell phone to her father who was subsequently able to glean a number of clues about the perpetrators from the call and the cell phone he is able to recover on his arrival in Paris. Our hero wastes no time in tracking down a series of villains many of who are of Albanian origin and operate a scheme to dupe innocent young girls into drugs and prostitution.<br/><br/>As ruthless as the Albanians and assorted other criminals are, they do not possess very good marksmanship and are ultimately no match for the cadre of skill and determination displayed by the abducted girl's vigilante father. For instance, the English-speaking American agent is easily able to pass for a French detective in a ruse to help ferret out some of the gang-member's crime operations.

Long story short Liam Neeson plays a government preventer ( whatever that means) who is trying to reconnect with his daughter after years of working for the government. His daughter wants to go to Europe with a friend (another spoiled girl). He finally gives in to pressure and allows her to go . Once there the action never stops. This film shows what any man who loves his daughter would do if anyone tried to hurt her.Having unlimited help from friends who still have gov. access helps quite a bit also.Bottom line great film , great acting from Liam Neeson (as always) non stop action , and a happy ending ( I really enjoyed last scene totally unexpected ) Rent it you will not be sorry."

","Stranded in the office because of storm-related flooding, I watched this movie to pass the time. And my, that time went by so fast with this film! Liam Neeson plays Bryan, a divorced, down-and-out retired spy who hankers to get closer with his daughter, Kim. Daughter goes to Paris one day but gets abducted by a white slavery gang on her first day there. But fortunately, she just so happened to be on the phone with her dad when she got abducted. So super-spy dad figures everything out from the little he had recorded on his phone, goes to Paris, infiltrates the Albanian gang and rescues his daughter after she has been sold off at a flesh auction. This was all told within an hour and a half of exciting movie story-telling.<br/><br/>Director Pierre Morel does very well in his first English language feature, after being more well known as a cinematographer in France. It is written by prominent French writer/director Luc Besson. They don't waste time on unnecessary details. Of course, you need to suspend your disbelief as Bryan methodically executes his perfect plans with nary a hitch, and the impossible became a reality.<br/><br/>It was a good action thriller. The family drama interspersed with the action does not fail to give it some heart. This film goes straight to the point. There is not a moment of screen time or your time wasted."

","A father's worst nightmare is what Bryan Mills, a former CIA agent, has to endure when his daughter, whom he reluctantly let go on a trip to Paris with her friend Amanda, is kidnapped right after she arrives in the city. The purpose of her being taken away is not for ransom money, it is because this girl is a young morsel for the degenerate crowd that deal in turning these naive women into prostitution and drugs for a profit.<br/><br/>""Taken"", directed by Pierre Morel, is a thriller that comes from Luc Besson and his factory that churns this type of entertainment for fans of this genre. It is better to leave one's mind at the entrance of the cinema, or in another room if it is viewed on DVD, or another type of format, because most of the action is incredible, at best. We don't mean to say the film is unwatchable, for it is the kind of action film that keeps audiences riveted to the screen. But alas, when not even the first 30 minutes of screen time have elapsed, Bryan Mills has disposed of a dozen men, and he will get rid of many more scum bags before the flick is over! Why did the CIA did not insist in keeping Mills in its payroll is hard to imagine; he is a one man invincible team. In many aspects ""Taken"" is a comic book fantasy.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson, much leaner than he used to be, appears as the hero of the story. This man is so resourceful that he knows from early on because of his contacts who is behind the group that took his daughter away. He is an action man when threatened, in this case because the love for his only daughter. Mr. Neeson is the whole picture and he does not disappoint. Others in the cast include the wonderful Famke Janssen, Maggie Grace, and other less unknown faces.<br/><br/>The editing by Frederic Thoraval needs to be mentioned because the way the action is arranged to create the immediacy and fast pacing that are necessary for a film of this genre. The cinematographer, Michel Abramowicz, does a good job capturing Paris, especially at night. Pierre Morel, whose second venture in directing this is, will go far if he chooses wisely for he can deliver a thriller like ""Taken"" almost effortlessly."

First of all, her friend is dead... and yet she seems as happy-go-lucky as ever! This may be a minor detail, but I thought they could have brought out some of the after effects better than they did.I think this movie could have been more of a wake up call to viewers (it still was) about the workings of the sex trade. Secondly, when she runs to embrace her mother with the same big, childlike grin on her face it makes you stop for a minute and wonder if this is seriously how they are going to end the movie!

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","2","28 June 2009"," Neeson is the perfect fit for a revenge thriller long overdue
","""Taken"" only begs one question: Why did it take producers this long to give Liam Neeson his own revenge thriller? OK, there was Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"" in 1990, a cult favorite before Neeson rose to fame, but the Irish actor who seems to age like fine wine has dished it to baddies in 18th Century Scotland (""Rob Roy""), a galaxy far, far away (""Star Wars: Episode I""), during the Crusades (""Kingdom of Heaven"") and dare I say WWII Germany? So what took so long for him to be a modern day retired CIA agent?<br/><br/>""Taken"" and Neeson belong together. Neeson has always well-played the wise mentor role that draws respect from all other characters in the films he's in and the audiences. He's a natural fit to play an older man still capable of laying a beat down on amoral criminals, particularly of the European trash variety. ""Taken"" is a simple but genius vehicle to deliver that.<br/><br/>Written in part by Luc Besson, whose films (""Leon: The Professional"") have only gotten more commercial with age (""The Transporter"" and sequels), ""Taken"" tells the simple story of former CIA agent Bryan Mills, who retires in order to make up for lost time with his 17-year-old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace from early ""Lost""), a relationship destroyed by Bryan's never being around. When Kim goes to spend the summer in Paris, her overprotective father calls her right when she gets there, convenient timing considering she's about to be kidnapped. Bryan vows revenge on the kidnapper and flies to Paris, using his incredible wealth of skills to track her down and make her captors pay.<br/><br/>Besson gives us another action/revenge story motivated by love. The father/daughter connection can never be exploited enough considering it guarantees our utmost sympathies. It also makes the hard-nosed ""don't mess with me"" attitude of Neeson on his revenge spree all the more crucial in our minds. ""Taken"" never has a dull moment because we're behind Neeson 100 percent and love every move he makes.<br/><br/>Sure, ""Taken"" could go much deeper. It's sort of just assumed that part of Neeson's motivation is to prove to his daughter how much he cares, but that never actually crosses our minds thanks to anything that's in the script or that director Pierre Morel does. It also couldn't hurt to make Bryan a bit more conflicted; give us some sense that he's not exactly a paragon of justice, something that would make ""Taken"" come more from the head and a tad less from the fists. Instead, the movie happily enjoys the fact that it's plot, motivation, action and force of an actor in Neeson will win over the audience. And it definitely does."

Nothing was overtly wrong with the movie and nothing was great except Neeson's performance. I loved story flowed a little too nicely and he got his information almost too quickly, but I bought it and was easily overlooked. It was interesting that I almost looked forward to Neeson's dialog more than his action, but both complimented each other in a way you rarely ever see in action movies. I honestly like Luc Besson probably more than I should and I will not hide that fact. I do not think this is a particularly good movie, but it was a lot of fun to watch at least once.

","I have to say, I am in love. Liam Neeson is god. Taken is a fairly run of the mill action movie, utilizing several times the ""Bourne"" method of camera work during several action scenes. I'm sure you know, but I'll explain it to all the newbies out there (because I'm that popular already). Shaky, shaky camera, cutting back and forth between what's happening, seizure inducing, etc. Liam Neeson is Bryan Mills, a retired spy/secret agent/whatever goes on a kick ass rampage of anger and destruction in an effort to find his kidnapped daughter, who is being sold into the sex trade. It's fun in the beginning, seeing Bryan's goofy smile when he makes his daughter happy, and watching him trying to be a father figure in his daughter's life. But that all pales when you see the transformation from bumbling dad to Deathbringer 5000. The smile disappears, and that's the first indication that all you're going to be seeing from him from then on is lovely, face-breaking violence. One problem I did have was some of the things you're expected to believe, like how he was able to get the exact name and home town from a brief description by a frightened teenage girl and a few moments of Albanian speech. I could be wrong and this sort of thing happens all the time, but it just seemed silly to me. And the very end. They should have just stopped. But they didn't. As you can tell, I was attempting not to give too much away."

I concur.<br/><br/>TAKEN is pretty much a one-man show as Liam, with his always impeccable acting skills, carries it, though Xander Berkeley is good too, as far as his bit part allows him to be. Liam makes one hell of a tough guy. Watching this retired ""preventer"" come out of retirement before our eyes as he hears his daughter being kidnapped was the best scene and set us up for the tension and excitement that followed.

If I had heard the plot of this movie and knew nothing else about it, I would probably have assumed that it stars Harrison Ford. What a surprise that Liam Neeson plays a former government agent searching for his kidnapped daughter, using rather aggressive tactics. Seriously, some of what he does just might count as torture.<br/><br/>What I thought early on was that the one girl did incredibly stupid things when they arrived in Paris: giving a bunch of information to a stranger. This is only the second time that I've heard Albanian spoken (the first was in ""The Inside Man"", in which I learned how to pronounce Enver Hoxha's surname).

","I have to start with a review of the movie, in a magazine (Empire), which gave this movie a real rating.

Entertain might seem a bit of a stretch if you have seen the movie, but I do stand by that. After a slow start, the pace picks up and there is almost no stop until the end.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty intense, but it is completely justifiable.

Neeson leaves many bodies in his wake as he tears, literally, through Paris, to get to the men who took his daughter. Brutal and decisive, Neeson is a machine, nearly maniacal in his single-minded pursuit to get to his daughter, no matter the cost.<br/><br/>Stylish and pretty, though somewhat muted (more ""real"" according to the extras on the DVD) Paris is the beautiful backdrop to the horrific underworld enterprise goings on. Penned by the great French auteur Luc Besson and helmed by a French director, Phillip Morel, the film does have a certain ""foreign"" feel and in fact was released in France before the US. Morel's history as a Director of Photography also gives the visuals their refined but also slightly gritty, rain-slicked feel.<br/><br/>While stylish and essentially perfectly composed as an action movie, ""Taken"" has no great message other than to say: Don't mess with my daughter, pal. It might serve to make us dads feel quite inadequate as protectors of our children. Don't know about you but I wouldn't feel comfortable stepping into a room of 7 Albanian criminals and waxing them all.

The film moves so rapidly, with the skills of cinematographer Michel Abramowicz, that the various other characters who populate this drama scarcely have time to establish an identity (Famke Janssen, Radivoje Bukvic, Maggie Grace et al). The violence is constant but due to Bryan Mills' skills each death is so rapid that the camera doesn't linger There are scenes in the brothels where the drug induced young girls serve as prostitutes that are quite disturbing, but again the camera doesn't pause long enough to make them gruesome. <br/><br/>This is a fine performance by Liam Neeson who demonstrates a mastery of the action roles that likely will lead to others in a similar vein.

The cast is rounded out well, featuring a particularly strong supporting turn by Famke Janssen.<br/><br/>Originally posing as an almost-innocent family drama, ""Taken"" quickly takes a turn for the nightmarish when Kim (the daughter) is ripped from her idyllic Paris vacation and smuggled into its seedy criminal underbelly.<br/><br/>What follows is a magnificently filmed romp through Paris and parts unknown as Neeson's character returns from his retirement in a decisively violent way, upholding his pledge that he will find those who have his daughter, and he will kill them.<br/><br/>The writing is fast-paced, the dialogue crisp and believable; the music is perfect in setting the atmosphere of any given moment; the cinematography is fresh and exciting. In essence, it is a cinematic slam dunk which should be used as a benchmark from which to judge others of its genre."
"antti-57","8","1","2","23 April 2009"," Good action movie but bit unfinished
","This is pretty good action movie. Unlike many other its kind, you really cant feel the 'hero' would overreact. Personally I really don't like abuse of women, and move shows some gruesome scenes of it, which make me actually glad of the body count.<br/><br/>Usually I dislike the high body count, because it has flimsy excuses for sake of just killing. But in this case, I could actually believe character Liam Nelson played would act so and very few people would object to it.<br/><br/>Every father worries for his daughter, and in that respect I found Liam's actions actually believable.<br/><br/>There are some ackward moments in the film like others have noted. Like when the main character portrays himself as French official and starts to talk to albanian criminals about satellites who see and hear everything - in plain English. Next he asks things he should know either by being person he portrays or what he should know if the satellites really see and hear everything. Also in few scenes I think more people would have come to arrest main characters. He seems to occasionally have aura of untouchablity.<br/><br/>But these are minor flaws, lot of action films have lot more blatant and less subtle errors. At least in this movie each car that crashes somewhere doesn't blow up automatically.<br/><br/>What bit ruined me it all was the end of the movie. I can understand that people recover fast, but I found it bit implausible that the daughter returns to childhood dreams enthuastically despite her best friend got killed and she herself kidnapped, drugged and almost raped.<br/><br/>After seen the body count and surroundings it didn't feel plausible.<br/><br/>Overall I think Liam Neelson played his part very well, but the script was bit oversimplified in some parts which left him look bit stupid I think. His character needed bit more depth in the father daughter relation.<br/><br/>But he was very believable action person, really refreshing to see something not so overblown as in many Hollywood films."
"wynonasbigbrownbeaver","8","1","2","15 April 2009"," It proves that Liam Neeson can pack a punch.
","This movie successfully fills that ""Bourne"" void, that I've been feeling lately. Taken is about what an ex-spy has to go through to rescue his kidnapped daughter. It shows an extremist point of view through the eyes of Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) as he kicks, punches, and shoots his way through Paris. <br/><br/>For a 90 minute movie, it starts packing a punch after the first 15 minutes. Character development was straight forward, and digs deep enough to know the current situation between Bryan Mills and his ex-wife and estranged daughter. In the beginning, I almost thought the story was going on a tangent into unnecessary territory, (with that pop singers body guard ordeal), I start thinking to myself ""When is Liam Neeson going to start kicking butt?"" But when it started to get good, it got great. <br/><br/>The action scenes are an adrenaline rush that emanates the spirit of the ""Bourne-Trilogy"", except that this one is more emotional and personal. It was fun to see Liam Neeson muscle and interrogate his way through the Airport, the construction site, the hideout, the fancy party, and the yacht. All the fights and shootouts were quick. That escape scene when Liam Neeson was tied to an overhead lead pipe was a bit clichéd but it didn't ruin the fun ride. I said to myself ""Yeah Liam, beat the Sh__ out of them..."" Psychologically it shows what extreme methods someone has to go through to save their loved ones. Even it means threatening and shooting innocent people, but ""it was only a flesh wound"".<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend this movie, that's unless you're associated with the French Police (This wasn't a positive portrayal of the French government.)"
"MovieDude1893","6","1","2","5 April 2009"," Mindless, but Well Made
","Taken {dir. Pierre Morel, 2009} (**½/****) <br/><br/>A mindless little thriller, but entertaining in its own right. It features Liam Neeson (good to see him back in leading film roles) as an ex- C.I.A. Agent. Neeson daughter is kidnapped whilst vacationing with a friend in France and it falls to Neeson to get her back. The film's best scene comes early with Neeson addressing the kidnappers over the phone, and warning them that they are unaware of with whom they are messing. He, of course, phrases it differently and speaks with a steely reserve that is quite effective. Neeson is very good, but overall Taken is too mindless, to violent and too xenophobic to truly recommend."
"bird26","9","1","2","5 April 2009"," no fancy comments
","This action thriller was so good, I actually looked up my forgotten IMDb password in order to give it a 9/10 rating.<br/><br/>Screw Bourne and Bond, this film put them to sleep hands down.<br/><br/>I admit that the beginning of the film was somewhat boring and predictable, but hell, after her daughter was adopted, it was none stop action.<br/><br/>If you are looking for action, gun fire and no-dragging fighting scene (come on, some of Boned's fighting scenes put me to sleep. If I want to watch a realistic fight, I'd watch MMA).<br/><br/>If you like Bourne series or Bond series, watch this. You won't regret it."

","Grab a dramatic storyline , some awesome action sequences and a determined father (played only as Liam neeson could) and you have ""taken"".<br/><br/>It really is a great movie.<br/><br/>The film follows Bryan ex - spy. He has moved to Los Angeles to be closer to his daughter. He has some lost time to make up for. But When his daughter(Kim) goes on a trip abroad to Paris and is kidnapped by professionals who steal young girls and force them into the sex/slave trade he takes on a new objective to get his daughter back!.<br/><br/>This film is straight to the point there is no messing about and it really lets you know that Bryan knows exactly what he's doing he knows what to do instantly.<br/><br/>Neeson is brilliant as ""Bryan"" in the film and to be honest really makes the film what it is. With some outstanding hand to hand combat and awesome kick ass dialogue this could well be one of neesons finest moments on the screen.<br/><br/>The film is very realistic and very gritty. It's not afraid to go right out and show you how real this situation is. With plenty of guts and blood it will satisfy anyone who is a fan of the action genre. And at the same time it creates the perfect blend of action to drama and will satisfy anyone who loves there films with a bit of drama. I guess you could say it's a thriller.<br/><br/>The settings are all spot on and really captures the gloomy rough terrains of Paris in comparison to the sunshine state! that is California. This really makes it stand out that they are not at home!.<br/><br/>It's like a ticking bomb throughout it puts you into the film. Every minute that goes by is a minute closer to something happening to Kim and the difference between Bryan either finding or not finding his daughter before it's too late. You really are on the edge of your seat throughout and you don't move from there until the credits role the film is so unpredictable and you don't see anything coming. It has to be one of the fastest paced action movies or movies for that natter that i have ever seen and i loved it.<br/><br/>It doesn't ever get boring or drag on in fact it's bad that it had to end!. It keeps it short and sweet.<br/><br/>Overall it has to be one of the best films i've seen in quite a while and definitely one of my favourite action movies.<br/><br/>A solid 9/10 from me."
"AbNoc","7","1","2","1 April 2009"," My armpits are sweaty
","To get right down to it, Taken is a very gratifying film in terms of action. Liam Neeson does the job of portraying his role of the father well enough and the movie gives just enough background for the audience to care about him (His daughter, not so much). More importantly, he executes the fighting sequences very professionally and realistically although his character does go overboard a tad. But the viewers will not be disappointed as all the purveyors of the disgusting illegal trade of peddling drugged up prostitutes do get their comeuppance (at least the ones that Neeson encounters). Luc Besson (The Fifth Element) and Pierre Morel (Unleashed) show that they are established flashy film makers who know how to entertain right when they work together.<br/><br/>Yes, there are problems such as the acting at the end where the daughter does not show her gratification enough (one other reviewer mentions this) as well as the effects of the horribleness that she has gone through (and the fact that she can go from really drugged up to lucid in the span of 15 minutes). There are also loose ends of the politics and consequences for what Neeson's character did, but that would make the movie longer and less of what it's supposed to be: a satisfying, fast-paced vengeance of a bad ass father totally focused on saving his daughter from the worst circumstances for a girl.<br/><br/>I feel like an old man for saying this, but I hope teens, as well as the parents, learn something about life not being a party all the time and responsibility as a parent, respectively."
"SkullyD","8","1","2","24 March 2009"," A gripping, emotionally-charged thriller.
","The premise of ""Taken"" seems like a pretty standard kidnapping thriller. What elevates this film is a brilliant Liam Neeson, who portrays an ex-black ops or CIA agent (it's never really clear) struggling to connect with his teenage daughter and the emasculation of retirement. When his daughter goes missing on a trip to Europe, he gets a chance to kick some ass again. But that's not the point of the story. Neeson's performance is fueled by desperation. Every minute he's delayed, he could lose his daughter to the European sex-trafficking circuit. It's this sense of urgency that drives this film forward and twists the viewer's stomach in knots. That's not to say the film doesn't provide some truly exciting action sequences, and there are some great visceral moments when Neeson takes on the bad guys. But what makes this film truly stand out is it's heart. Thank Luc Besson, who wrote the script, for injecting some humanity into all the thrills. His writing, coupled with Neeson's performance, combined with a very timely subject matter (human trafficking) and you have the makings of a great thriller."
"jdkraus","8","1","2","18 March 2009"," Liam is the driving force in the movie
","I did see this movie on opening weekend but I have not gotten the chance to sit down and write my review for it. Now that I finally have the chance here it goes. I won't bother in mentioning the plot for the trailers show plenty of it (but not necessarily all of it). This movie is an action flick, and I love action, but that is not the main reason why I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Over the years, I have seen Liam Neeson in many movies and even if the film is horrible, he makes something out of it. He gives an exceptional performance. His role his rather unique, because I'm not used to him as a leading action hero, nonetheless, he pulls it off and adds both humane and grim layers to his character, which I love (you'll see what <br/><br/>I mean by this when you watch the film). The rest of the movie is solid, ranging from the excellent car and on-foot pursuits, to the gun battles, hand-to-hand combat and the interesting plots and surprising emotional impact. It's good, but Liam is the driving force. I rooted for him throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Overall rating *** out of ****"
"stevie_boy2010","8","1","2","16 March 2009"," A good movie, good but harsh.
","This is a pure adrenaline rush of a movie, non stop with a disturbingly relevant premise to today's world it can make difficult viewing at times.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson, certainly plays the part as a man on a single minded mission focused purely on one thing and one thing only.....to get his daughter back.<br/><br/>She and her friend are very quickly targeted by sex traffickers on their arrival in gay Paris and from that point on this is all about track and revenge, and boy does Neeson take his revenge!<br/><br/>OK, some of the sequences do become a little bit over the top but right to the end your still asking yourself if his daughter is alive and 'intact'.<br/><br/>I have to describe this movie as harsh. The premise about young girls being forced into prostitution is far too relevant in today's society to make this a simple action movie. Therefore it is very difficult to class as 'entertainment' seeing as there is some social commentary involved.<br/><br/>That aside though this is a solid film, and one that will keep your insides twisted right till the end."
"pc95","7","1","2","15 March 2009"," Great Pacing and Action
","Probably one of the best movies in awhile and certainly the best action movie in a year or two, Taken is a lean and exhilarating movie that sets itself up very well. Liam Neeson is first rate and mostly believable as ""Preventor"" Mills. Director Pierre Morel sets up the characters and situation with the right amount of time, depth, and history to give us something to latch on to. Then, the movie launches and it really launches. It's going full speed for at least 50 min or 2/3 of it's runtime. The action and fight scenes rival the best of today's movies including Bourne and James Bond. (spoiler) You have to suspend belief a little bit with a late 50's Neeson taking on 8 younger men in a room, but that's about where it ends. Taken has great focus and direction and is a highly effective action movie, one of the best in recent memory. Recommended."
"tubby1","6","1","2","14 March 2009"," Not bad at all.
","In a non-stop hunt to rescue his beloved daughter from kidnappers Liam Neeson kills, maims, chases and drives cars in this relentless action/thriller set predominantly in Paris.<br/><br/>Taken has a familiar feel to that of the Jason Bourne films except this is more direct and easier-to follow plot, which does not tarnish the film. I cannot fault the entertainment value and the intrigue that the screenplay creates but it is hampered, like many such films by fortuitous events, which frustrates me personally.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson impresses as the ex-CIA agent and I never for one moment thought that he was not a viable operative. He gives a heartfelt and understandable desperate feel to his character with a real emotive punch. <br/><br/>For me the best moment in the film was the actual kidnapping, it was excellently crafted and the interplay between Neeson and Maggie Grace on the phone prior to her being taken, is perfectly pitched and brings great tension.<br/><br/>Taken is an entertaining film which does not tire. The actual premise is hard to come to terms with as it feels rather strained and events unfold regrettably with too much fortune for the protagonist but Taken is a thriller to enjoy and to be gripped by."

As the fast paced story line progresses you will find yourself involved in the amazing action and thrill. Undoubtly this is better than what you'd expect. It kind of reminded me of james bond and bourne. but its different in its own way. This is how the movies should made, the things which were highly important in this kind of storyline were there in the movie. That made movie much faster and entertaining ,Good editing indeed !!

"Robert_duder","8","1","2","5 March 2009"," Taken is the kind of action flick that makes going to the movies worthwhile
","I really didn't know what to expect going to see Taken. Was it a drama or suspense thriller? Was it a pseudo action flick along the same vein as Mel Gibson's Ransom? I was pleasantly surprised that there was nothing pseudo about this film. Taken is a stone cold action flick with a captivating story that actually has some meat behind it but a straight forward kick-butt action hero kicking butt and taking names to get back his daughter. Comparisons to the Bourne films are not unfounded. The film goes from the U.S. through the seedy underbelly of Europe. The film has a serious enough message about human trafficking but still has this mainstream story about a father searching for his daughter and as he says in one of my favorite lines he ""has a certain set of skills that makes"" him ""a nightmare for people like you."" The story manages to develop the main character and what he can do without actually ever showing him in his prime. Instead they introduce him through a bodyguard job and other small hints that he is a killer, and very good at what he does. Unlike other action films or heroes they don't try to introduce us by giving us a big back story. The film focuses on the task at end and is non stop action.<br/><br/>I've never been a huge fan of Liam Neeson, he's okay but never really impressed me. That all changed watching him lead this film. Liam Neeson is incredible as the father who will stop at nothing to save his daughter. He's brooding and powerful and is just flawless at the combat and the action scenes. He does a great job. Maggie Grace plays Neeson's daughter who is taken by traffickers. She certainly appears younger than what she is but she doesn't a decent enough job. Her and Neeson have good chemistry as father and daughter. Famke Janssen takes a huge back seat role as Grace's mother and Neeson's estranged wife. She barely has any lines and hardly shares screen time. While the rest of the cast are just barely supporting none of them really stand out. I mean they all do a fine job but Neeson really shines and heads this film up so well that no one stands out above him and no one stands against him.<br/><br/>Although a brilliant cinematographer and having worked on many great action films french director Pierre Morel hasn't had a lot of directing experience but it is clear that he has had some great mentors likely including Luc Besson who is a brilliant director writer and film maker. Regardless Morel has a flare and style all his own and really handled the film well. Taken is a rare gem in action films because I don't think anyone sees it coming. It's an action thrill ride with heart and will entertain even the staunchest of critics. 8.5/10"
"irfan-hamid","9","1","2","28 February 2009"," Go see the movie!
","This was the best mix of action/suspense I have seen in a long time. Liam Neeson is phenomenal in this movie, his dialog delivery is awesome; when he calmly tells the kidnapper of his daughter that he will find him and kill him, there was no reason not to believe him. But without a doubt the absolute best thing about this movie was that Neeson was not a typical Hollywood hero or good guy, never once did he stand over a helpless antagonist and magnanimously ""I won't kill you, that would make me as bad as you""; he kills them alright, he shoots them in the back and tortures them to death to extract information, something I would expect the loving father of a kidnapped daughter to do.<br/><br/>The only faux-pas by the film was casting a 25 year old Maggie Grace as a 17 year old girl. Her running around prancing in teenager dresses and affecting a fake case of pigeon toes was kind of disturbing.<br/><br/>But overall one of the best films I've seen in recent years."
"louiextreme","7","1","2","28 February 2009"," Great emotion and topic; weak film technique
","So i went to see this movie with my friend, hearing beforehand that it was going to be more than any other action movie. So true! This movie takes action sauce and pours in a dash of real drama and a glob of rough, true-world topic. There are scenes that you will watch and burn with rage at the appalling business that the antagonists are engaged in. Your eyes will widen and your spine will chill faster than you thought possible at the action's thrills and surprises.<br/><br/>I had some issues with this movie, though. The cinematography is not up to par with many movies i've seen. There are several action scenes that are missing a huge chunk of quality. Pierre Morel fails to take advantage of the camera's ability to enhance the emotion and give the audience a blow-away experience. He makes the same mistake with the editing and the sound mixing. Timing kills certain pieces of the movie that could have turned out incredible.<br/><br/>I will admit, though, Neeson does a darn good job with his character in this film. His character is both brutal and loving, a hard-trained killer spy and a real genuine father at the same time, something i have barely ever seen from any other actor in any other movie.<br/><br/>Go see this for the subject matter and the acting. Despite its lack of effective film technique, it is still very worth watching."

The beginning is just like any other movie, slow enough to introduce the characters, then the action begins and i swear i didn't blink the entire rest of the movie! i was glued to the screen unlike most of the movies I've seen recently. someone else compared it to the Borne series and i kinda agree with that, it has the same kinda fast paced action that is totally addictive! when it ended i couldn't believe i was in there for 1.5 hours or however long it is, in the entire movie i wasn't even tempted to look at my watch and see how much longer it was gonna be. Another reason i liked it was that everything i wanted to happen happened, unlike a lot of movies where you wish something should or shouldn't have happened sooner or later than it did.

"NeilCreates","9","1","2","27 February 2009"," Neeson makes Bond look like a schoolboy
","Liam Neeson in an action role. He is not the actor you'd instantly cast. But it's done so well. Neeson plays Bryan, a retired ""preventer of bad things"". From this movie, we learn that being the ""preventer of bad things"" means being able to beat this shite out of anyone in under 10 seconds. But when Bryan's daughter is kidnapped, Bryan is forced out of retirement.<br/><br/>It's not a new idea, but the way it's executed is. The way the plot develops and how the characters grow is the appeal of the movie. We really want Bryan to succeed but at the same time, we have doubts as to his brutal methods. Is it right that he tortures a bad guy who is absolutely terrified? As Bryan's daughter is kidnapped, we are shown an extremely powerful scene. I won't spoil it for you but it's easily one of the best in cinema.<br/><br/>As Bryan rips through Paris, he takes out bad guys in extremely realistic fashion. There are no fancy kicks or drawn out fights. Bryan uses logical attacks - hit the throat or head until they stop moving.<br/><br/>Having said that, there is one lengthy fight. There is one guy in the entire film that lasts more than 20 seconds against Bryan. It works so well because when half a minute has passed, we're thinking ""Erm...ok Liam, hurry up."" The result is an edge-of-your-seat battle with hardcore moves. Does Bryan survive the fight? That's the question I was dying to find out throughout. And more importantly - will he save his daughter? All in all, TAKEN is an action-filled thriller with very strong emotion and powerful themes, coupled with incredible acting and beautiful direction. A must-see for any thriller fans, whether you're into action or not."

","I tried to like this film, and at times, I did. It has some great moments. Overall, it's a pretty good action picture, despite what I call the ""Rambo"" plot: one make takes on the world - and wins! It's certainly an exciting, edge-of-your-seat nail-biter. But...I have traveled to Paris with my sister and as soon as the girls went looking for cabs, I said to myself, ""No. You don't just hop in a cab with a cute stranger. In fact, you should have reserved a shuttle and had it waiting for you."" It kind of bugged me that the girl's mother or stepfather (himself a world traveler) hadn't thought of doing that. Combine that with her friend being a complete airhead, and they didn't stand a chance. I thought they'd at least make it to the 'party' the cute guy from the cab had invited them to before they got nabbed. <br/><br/>Enter Liam Neeson. Great actor, does a good job with the material he's given, and is very convincing. But after he found the bad guys in record time and had escaped being killed, run off the road, arrested, beaten up, or otherwise stopped for about the 4th or so time, I could no longer suspend disbelief at the incredible luck he had. Yes, we want him to win and the bad guys to pay, but come on. Virtually no setbacks from start to finish? No one's that lucky.<br/><br/>For what it was, it was a pretty good ride. But if you want to see an action movie with a whole lot more, I would recommend ""Gran Torino."""

","There has been a lot of talk saying ""Taken"" is a heart pounding,adrenaline rushing, must see movie. There is nothing great about this movie. There was corny action scenes like when the main character does ten flips down a hill with a Jeep and drives off like nothing happened. The humor was OK, could have been more, and not the greatest acting and dialog. The plot of the movie was totally ""Taken"" away from another movie where people kidnap women who have just crossed the border, turn them into prostitutes and sell them to rich perves. The only thing they changed with the movie from the other was putting action scenes in it that weren't that great at all.

","Lots of spoilers! I must have seen the previews for 'Taken' between TV programs several times/week and it was beginning to get really irritating. However, there was something about the vigilante plot that made me want to see it. 'Taken' started out a bit slow, with the background of the family - Liam was the Dad who quit his Secret Service job to get closer to his daughter, whom he rarely saw because of his job. His ex-wife remarried an ubra rich guy who upstages him at his daughter's 17th birthday by giving her an incredibly beautiful horse. Liam brought a karaoke machine. This all wraps up nicely in the end - I won't give it all away. So the daughter decides to go to Paris with a friend, pretending to stay at a cousin's place with aunt/uncle who, of course, aren't in Paris - they took a trip somewhere else. So the two girls land in Paris and are immediately hit on by a cute boy who shares a cab with them, checks out their place and calls in their location (and that they're alone)to a ring of international human traffic-ers. The two girls are typical teenagers their first time away from home - freedom clouds judgment - taking rides from strangers in a foreign country - in which neither could speak the language, bragging they're alone, bragging the whole '5th floor' is theirs, and they want to party. Good Lord, write 'stupid' on their foreheads and send in Jason (Friday the 13th). That's where the previews begin - but nothing could prepare me for Liam's strength and drive at finding his daughter. No Jedi tricks here - This guy does not fool around chatting or providing background for the audience who might have dozed off and forgotten the plot. He goes right for the information - and kills anyone in the way - right away - no time for them to plead for their lives or 'James Bond' their way out of his clutches. Liams takes the shot - every time. It feels good - these guys are scum of the scum. 'Taken' gives the audience what they don't get in 'real' life - quick justice for creeps, another chance for parents who should be more careful in sending their kids off places unsupervised - just because other parents aren't taking the time to make sure the 'i's are dotted and 't's crossed for teenage journeys. The films wraps up really nicely, too. The introduction into Liam's type of job at the very beginning of the movie comes in again at the end - like the stuffed bear Ryan brings back for his daughter in ""Red October"". Great directing - action shots are incredibly well done ala Die Hard and Bourne. Pace is fast, steady but with a breath here and there so you're not exhausted by the end of the movie. I haven't seen a good action movie like this since 'Live Free or Die Hard'. This is a good one- don't miss it - in the theater."

","If you're an Indian or have seen a good number of recent Indian movies, the story of the film will not be new to you. It's about a former CIA operative (Liam Neeson) whose daughter is kidnapped when she's on a tour of Europe in Paris. The kidnappers are part of a notorious group of Albanian sex traffickers and Neeson has just three days before she is sold to somebody.<br/><br/>This film has a good blend of action and sentiment. The tempo of the film is really fast. There are a few high-speed fight scenes that keep you on the edge of your seats, especially the ones during the last 20 min of the film. Overall, I would give it a 7.5/10."
"rvs_dmr","8","1","2","11 February 2009"," Man on Fire vs Bourne
","Looked up the rating at IMDb just before seeing this movie and i was pretty much surprised by the 8.0 I was seeing om my screen. For some reason I never heard before of this movie, so I did not have any expectations or whatsoever.<br/><br/>And what pleasant surprise this movie was! The storyline, which reminded me of Man on Fire, is all about Bryan Mill's daughter being kidnapped in Paris and him getting her back. The kidnap turns out to be a bad move for the kidnapper, because Bryan Mills used to be ""spy"" or something like that in the old days, and still has some skills up his sleeve. By the way, the fact you don't exactly are told what he used to be is a good example of how the characters in this movie are kept flat, which for a change is a good thing. Apart from some less meaningful scenes about divorced parents and the resulting mother-father-child relations, you will not find any distracting personal blabla in this movie. Heck, you even better could watch the latest James Bond if you want that.<br/><br/>Just as in Man on Fire, this action movie does not make any concessions. It is very right up your face. For example, when Bryan quite brutally interrogates an Albanian partner of the kidnappers, he tortures him by electrifying him. When he gets his answers he does not just walk away, no he walks away while switching the power back on again. Another method, but quite comparative to the situation in Man on Fire where Denzel Washington puts a bomb in the bad guy's ass, gets his answers, and still lets the bomb explode. However, where Man on Fire was just ""raw"", the action scenes in Taken are much more polished, and that is exactly where the comparison with the Bourne movies comes in. The hand to hand combat scenes are, just as in the Bourne movies, very fast and technical and filmed in the same way. The same goes for the scar chase scenes.<br/><br/>Raw action movies like these are quite rare, which in my opinion is a shame. Taken is not a brilliant movie, therefore it is to short and to simple, but on the other hand both the simplicity and shortness make the movie such a rush. In my opinion a well deserved 8!"

","The incredible invincible Liam! enters and do away everyone standing in his path of saving his beloved daughter.<br/><br/>Noticing the writer of the movie, no one could hesitate about watching a well-made action that amuses you during the whole movie-time. Writer of famous works like The Professional, Nikita,Taxi, and more-recent films like Transporter series and B13, has gained some fame for himself as an thriller-making writer and director. With this information, I was sure I would not regret spending time for his newly-made movie ""the Taken"" which is directed by Pierre Morel, the man behind ""B13"" which was a fascinating french movie of 2004. Like B13, Taken has a fast rhythm which has helped its director to show lots of actions and beating up and chasing scenes and as I expected, he's done it absolutely right. Morel knows the principles of an action movie that holds the audience spellbound during the movie time. Unlike B13, here we are facing with a superstar who clearly knows what he's doing. Liam Neeson has done a wonderful job as a father of a 17 years old girl. One that despite being separated from his family, loves his daughter very much and would do everything he could do for her best. The relation between father and his child is quite believable and turns up as one of the brightest aspects of the film. This helps the whole Brian's devoting thing to the end of the movies very rational. I suppose if it was a drama movie, It could bring tears to audience's eyes because of the right chemistry of characters and the whole acting things! To sum up, I enjoyed this movie a lot because of its strong screenplay and also the actors acting and above of all, the directing of this movie."
"blunthead","7","1","2","10 February 2009"," Entertaining and unique
","I hadn't been to a movie theater for years, but I don't think that alone explains why I enjoyed Taken as much as I did. The story is very appealing in this day wherein bad guys are worse than ever, and the rest of us are proportionately more abused. Going in we know the bad guys are really in for it this time. Though this one does not fall into the category strictly, there are too few revenge movies to be had.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson displays true acting flexibility and is one of the best heroes of the genre I've ever seen and I grew up with Connery-Bond. Indeed, during some of the action sequences, I couldn't help considering that, except for a kind of lurching instead of suaveness, Neeson could make the ideal Bond.<br/><br/>The action direction is good, but the dysfunctional interaction in the protagonist's family felt shallow to me--which, of course, doesn't matter--and the suspension of disbelief fails at times (a machine gun just doesn't miss that much at close range). The movie doesn't aim to win awards, just to be entertaining, and it succeeds.<br/><br/>Finally, Maggie Grace is remarkably convincing as a seventeen year old despite being twenty-six."
"mikefasssy","6","1","2","7 February 2009"," Worth a rental, but not much else
","First things first, I came into this movie with no expectations, it was simply a last minute recommendation from a friend.<br/><br/>Pros: Great production quality! The action scenes were well choreographed, car scenes weren't too laden with special fx, and the lighting of the film was really superb. To boot, the storyline was pretty convincing and the thematic content was quite serious. It was nice to see an emotional character written with a certain cold-blooded-ness that is usually glossed over for fear of alienating the audience. Oddly enough that brings me to my next point.<br/><br/>Cons: Gratuitous carnage. Probably about 10 cold-blooded murders with another 30-40 other 'slaughters'. I don't mind a bit of death, but this was over the top. It's foolish to assume that simply filming lots and lots of murder scenes will help a movie compete with other studio action films. Violence can be artfully and thoughtfully woven into a film, but that definitely did not occur here.<br/><br/>The ending was also a fairly big letdown, but at that point it felt like the film just wanted/needed to wrap up quickly - it was getting a bit tired.<br/><br/>All in all a fairly decent film, definitely a solid rental. It would have been eerily spectacular if it had been directed by David Cronenburg, a director who's understanding of violence and the more disturbing parts of the human psyche would have made this story pop!"

","Besson and Morel did a fine job. When you finally unwrap this ""American Action Movie"" you see the joke is us. It is apparent to me that to protect your brainless daughter from perils of Europe one has to be a cold-blooded killer. Once the spoiled brat boards the plane at LAX, you should start dusting off those old skills. Torture, gun play, reckless driving, hand-to-hand combat. Get ready to go on remorseless killing spree, because the seventeen-year-old blond sure is worth it. It does not matter a bit that the focus of parental affection displays total disregard for you. Lie in your face, ignore your advice, practically beg for trouble. Does not matter, honey, we love you, we will torture and kill anybody who mean you harm. Because you are special, you are going to be a singer. This movie gained a lot from casting Liam Neeson. Fine actor is able to push the right buttons so viewers are cheering at the carnage. Alas, at the end of the day the question creeps in. What if the bimbo's destiny was in fact to be drug-addicted sex-slave?

"jaredmobarak","8","1","2","30 January 2009"," Good luck  Taken
","Mr. Peter Morel, you have picked an express train to latch on togood for you. Something about Luc Besson just works every single time. I'm sad that his declaration of being finished with the director's chair may be true, however, his scripts are mounting and churning out entertaining action flicks. If you can get the Transporter series to make money from its wit and smart action, you know you are doing something right. I've yet to see these two guys' first collaboration, District B13, but as far as the sophomore effort goes, Taken, I have one more reason to finally seek it out. Released in Europe last year and finally making its way stateside at the end of January, the tale pits a retired US government ""preventer"" with the Albanian captors that stole his daughter in Paris. His job ruined his marriage, strained the relationship he had with his child, yet gave him the specific skill set to get it all back. All he has to do is kick some butt, kill numerous baddies without a glimpse of remorse, and call in a few favors, while burning some old bridges in the process. Liam Neeson shows the physicality that George Lucas must have seen when casting him as a Jedi warrior, but didn't utilize. Well, Morel sure opened the floodgates and Neeson does not disappoint.<br/><br/>The European flair shows face right at the start with the film's opening credits. Sure the star gets top billing, but who do you ask gets second and third? That's right, the director and writers, then followed by the title. Someone understands the true creativity behind a feature film. Well, not just someone, a continent. Whereas we in the states only care about who we see""doesn't that new Brad Pitt film look awesome?"" ""Oh, I don't know, I kind of wanted to check out the latest from Paul Thomas Anderson."" ""Who?""cinephiles abroad know the creators, the orchestrators, and the people for whom there'd be no words for Pitt to speak. It's a shame that the name Luc Besson won't fill the seats by itself here in America, because I'm sure if you mention a lot of his filmography to a film fan and ask what they all have in common, the answer would be, ""all films I really enjoy"". And yet the person answering probably has no idea what the common factor is allowing them to be such.<br/><br/>Shot with a kinetic pace, not quite Tony Scott speed as my friend suggested, more Bourne Supremacy, but even a bit clearer than that, the action excites at every turn. Neeson is a man on a mission; a man with everything on the line to find and save his daughter before the estimated 96 hours are up and she is lost forever, sold on the black market to be used, abused, and most likely disposed. Friends, enemies, strangers, you name it; they are all potential targets to be shot at. Neeson's Bryan Mills is the ultimate badass working from his heartusing his head, but only to survive, not to censor his actions so as to stay out of trouble. He gave it all up to rekindle a relationship with his seventeen year old, yet I'm sure never thought that the only way to do so would be to use all that training. The flip remark from Leland Orser, calling him Rambo, is more appropriate than you may think.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is definitely a necessity to keep the plot moving, but, in the end, it's all about Neeson moving forward and bull-rushing his way through extras. Maggie Grace can sadly get very tired, but I don't fault her as much as casting. She is a 26-year old playing 17, so her overly annoying, girlish tendencies are overblown because she is overcompensating for the age difference. Famke Janssen and Xander Berkler, two favorite character actors of mine, are solid in small roles, while my favorite supporter is Olivier Rabourdin's Jean-Claude. Playing a French Internal Government agent, an ex-associate of Neeson, he portrays the duality of wanting to help his friend while still keeping his job and financial influx intact. He knows that whatever is uncovered in the one-man vigilante escapade could potentially harm his paycheck by exposing illegal dealings with criminals on the part of the police force, so he is never completely open. And that guardedness leads to a fantastic dinner scene.<br/><br/>Taken is action-packed and a great showcase of Liam Neeson's ability to break out of the mild-mannered Brit he sometimes gets relegated into playing. No one is safe from his wrath and no obstacle will get in his way; in fact, those obstructions actually help him hide and kill with even more accuracy and safety. Besson also keeps his streak going of highly entertaining scripts helping to launch the careers of FrenchmenLouis Letterier going from Danny the Dog to Hollywood's The Incredible Hulk anyone? If this, and the high praise for District B13, is any indication, the name Peter Morel may soon be one on billboards stateside as well. As I said, he hitched his trailer to the right perpetually moving train."
"spencerthetracy","8","1","2","30 January 2009"," Action thriller that stands on its own
","**SPOILERS** This is certainly a first where we see Liam Neeson as the lead in an action movie. He was sublimely superb in his abbreviated appearance in Gangs of New York, but here he's top dog. And he pulls it off with surprising effectiveness in spite of his adding years.<br/><br/>You can really tell that Liam has put in his time at the gym. He's trim almost to the point of being gaunt. He doesn't have that bulky, largely masculine frame that we've always been used to.<br/><br/>He plays the part of a former CIA operative, now retired, who is cast back into action after his daughter is kidnapped soon after arriving in France. You really believe and really like his character in spite of the ruthless way he goes about getting his daughter back. Of course, the only people he wastes are bad ones, so no loss there. Your forbearance of his brutal means are somewhat tested however when he shoots and merely wounds the wife of a former French secret agent, once a compatriot, now riding a desk, aware of but not trying to stop the evil in his environs.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson does a very good job in this action thriller because of his usual dedication to the craft, his refusal to leave a scene unfinished, and his still ominous presence.<br/><br/>There are a few chin scratchers in the narrative like a few over the top car chases and the absurdity to believe that the French government would allow as many visitors to the country to simply disappear, but overall the action makes sense, especially considering that Liam's playing a father trying to rescue his daughter at any cost.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are convincing. The bad guys are ghoulish, the good guys are few but decent, and the actress playing the daughter does nicely.<br/><br/>While Taken has a few formulaic elements, it has its own thrill, its own flavor and with a performer like Liam Neeson it has an undeniable richness.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."
"ClintWardley1","8","1","2","11 January 2009"," Great Action Thriller
","Taken was a good action thriller. It's the type of movie where you cheer the hero and boo the villains. My father recommended this movie and called it ""Old Bourne - The movie they made if Bourne had retired and had a 17 year old daughter"" It was so good that I watched the 2nd half again, straight after watching it the first time. If you liked Bourne I whole heartily recommend this movie.<br/><br/>I use IMDb often to get a feel for whether a movie is worth spending the dollars to see at the cinema or wait for the DVD release. When the score from the Users ratings is really low I don't even bother with that. But when I truly enjoy a movie, I always find it amusing to read the ""hated it"" section of the User reviews. Why? It confirms my belief there are people out there with pushing some radical view point or have very narrow views on what is acceptable.<br/><br/>This is very obvious in the reviews with Taken. In the ""Hated it Section"" you have the guy who is anti-American"", the reviewer who is anti-violence, someone else who took offense just because some of the bad guys were eastern European and another who completely doesn't understand that review rating is controlled by the number of viewers who liked or disliked the movie, but berates IMDb & the majority of reviewers for not agreeing with his point of view. OK, you didn't like it, but please respect other reviewers opinions.<br/><br/>The main character, Bryan Mills was right when he told his daughter, ""I know the world, sweetie."" Because he knew there are people out there that have different agendas and values to those held by average middle class westerner. Which is the whole point of the story and is evident by some reviewers hostility.<br/><br/>Good movie, watch it."

"zedbazi141","8","1","2","14 December 2008"," Liam Neeson at his best
","Again we see Liam Neeson at his best in this under-rated action thriller. Taken exhibits perfectly how a film with a sustained story line should be shot; fast, exiting, witty and gritty. The film's plot revolves around the abduction of Kim the daughter of Bryan Mills a highly successful US spy. Bryan's journey to France to track Kim down from the hands of an Albanian criminal mob grips the audience in Pierre Morel's first serious attempt to display his craft in directing. Two things stand out about this film, the superb acting by Bryan (Liam Neeson) and the camera shots.<br/><br/>The audience sympathises with Bryan the father from the outset, he is likable, confident and determined to establish some sort of a relationship with his daughter. Against the backdrop of a now liberated and catered for ex-wife, Bryan does not seem to be concerned with scoring easy points against 'Lenore' (Famke Janssen), but instead wants to get down to business; finding his daughter and in the process killing the bad guys, this leaves the audience with their thumbs in their mouths.<br/><br/>The camera shots successfully highlights Bryan's other persona, both professional and ruthless. The audience is left in awe of Steven Seagal style hand to hand combat without feeling that they squandered money on a cheesy 2nd rate film. The camera angles shows the brutally of Liam Neeson well in his pursuit for answers, which at times shows his character to be heartless especially when he ignores the plight of other trafficked girls, which leaves us wondering IS THIS GUY AN ACTION HERO OR NOT?! The simple answer is no. Pierre Morel is a realist it seems when it came to shooting this film, any father would be concerned about the welfare of his own in merciless times, and Bryan is no different.<br/><br/>Overall Taken is a great action film which surpasses expectation; yes the acting of the 17 year old daughter resembles a 13 year old, but Liam Neeson's execution as a resolute wise and competent character surely compensates the lack of ability of other actors."

The movie takes you deeply in the human trafficking business. It has well presented one strategy of the kidnappers scheme. It showed how corrupted official make their own contributions in this business. And how excessive freedom given to the under-aged by their caregivers could add to the success of the kidnapping process. The father might have been over protective of his daughter, but on the other hand, the mother allowed her under-aged daughter to travel all around Europe to follow concerts of a famous music band!

Not as over the top as Bourne (which is still excellent), Neeson plays a character with the controlled rage that only someone highly trained can use properly. All of his fight scenes are well laid out for style when you consider the man is well over 6 feet tall, his moves are lethal using hand chops to his opponents throats in order to end the fight quickly, just like a true fighter would. I have nothing negative to say about this movie except its unfortunate that it wont see the publicity is deserves, nor will there likely be a sequel.

"zabost","9","1","2","31 October 2008"," Improbability at its very best
","""*Taken* lacks probability"", I read in numerous comments. Well, it does, indeed. But what's the fuss? Did I miss something? Was it supposed to be a documentary...? A movie, in my opinion, especially an action movie, is to entertain. To provide a safety valve through which the teeming emotions triggered by the everyday drudgery can be released. And they should serve the cause unharnessed by the constraints of the reality. ""Ambitious movies"", as my girlfriend labels the ones that convey some ""profound message"" and ""mirror reality"", are actually not that far from the remaining ones. In fact, they lack probability as well, the only difference being their producers who try to convince the public they are showing them life the way it really is. But then, if that was true, who the hell would spend their money to see that...? <br/><br/>Thus, action movies lack probability as much as they lack hypocrisy, bluntly stating they are mainly to entertain. ""Taken"" fits the profile perfectly. Still, it's nowhere near as rough as, let's say, ""Total Recall"", ""Eraser"" or any Arnie stuff. Its major strength is Liam Neeson and quite meticulous development of his character, Bryan. As he elbows his way through the assignment as the story unfolds, one can actually feel the bond with him and understand the reasons behind his going on a killing spree; It's a violent movie, but again, a whole lot more sophisticated than the usual Schwarzenegger kick-assery (nice term I spotted somewhere on the forums), basing on the longer spells of building the tension interwoven with the short, intense and action-packed combat scenes - an effect which only contributes to keeping the viewer on the edge of his seat. And last, but not least, Neeson's numerous one-liners, adding some black humor to the otherwise grim, Bourne-like atmosphere, are exceptional. Don't miss his cellphone monologue as he addresses the villain - that's the essence of the movie and the genre as a whole. <br/><br/>It's nine out of ten to me, and it would have been ten, wasn't it for the movie's length - it's only 93 minutes. I'm sure they could've come up with a few more improbable scenes should they wished."

However, if you ignore the minor details - the first half-hour is the set-up and then it is straight into high-speed car chases, a bit of parkour, close contact combat, gunfights, drugs, trafficking, immigration, spying, almost no nudity(yes, you read that right) moral dilemma of being a parent etc. and then some more...<br/><br/>I like Liam Neeson as an actor and was not fazed by his lack of distinct American accent - neither should you. He is no J. Bourne/Bond and he is not intended to be, no mystery - but his single-minded goal provides immense entertainment till the end and there is almost no let-up. There are plenty of languages thrown into the mix with the Paris backdrop, which no good euro-Besson flick would be complete without! A lot of action; if you had time to think - you are thinking waay too much.<br/><br/>A really good movie to get your blood flowing. Personally, I feel the movie does have an ethical side - but, no need to get tetchy about the politics - as you don't even have to leave home, read the papers or possess a connection for that these days, it will come at you faster than you can say Frantic!"

Where as the violence in ""saw"" is emotionless , here is is driven by very well acted level of aggression which continues through most of the film . the lead role has mental anguish pretty early on, but falls in to his ""work"" quite naturally as the movie progress. morals are questioned and even through it is action film ,there is a genuine use of white America to highlight some of the horrors of criminal society. a lot of the people become ""fodder"" here , and while they banter with their ego , the viewer quickly realizes the hero has already written their epitaph as he struggles to find interest in banter. A reason why I draw analogy to ""commando"" for the Internet generation ,the main sources of piracy on the Internet seem to be porn and music , in this film music is celebrated as giver of spirit where as porn/prostitution is portrayed as the direct product of greed and dehumanization . I hope this inspires you to watch this movie !"

","I'm about to not recommend this film but I ought to say that I only was able to get through the first forty-five minutes or so. Maybe it perked up and turned into a masterpiece in the last half. I doubt it.<br/><br/>I've always enjoyed Liam Neeson's work. He's a big hulking guy with a nose that begins in the middle of his forehead. He always sounds a little self conscious in front of the camera, as though he's reluctant to have his photograph taken. I like that in a guy.<br/><br/>He hasn't been on the screen much in recent years and I've wondered why. Now I believe that if this is the sort of garbage he's been offered, I can understand why he's enjoying his leisure time.<br/><br/>The genre is action movie. The propellant is the kidnapping of Neeson's daughter and her young friend to be sold into sex slavery. Neeson spends the movie traveling around, making threats and fulfilling them. He's an ex-spy and marshals all his skills to track the kids down in Europe. He bashes heads all over the continent. We've all seen it dozens of times before.<br/><br/>Given that it's formulaic, it still needn't be so terribly uninventive and uninteresting. ""Die Hard"" was an action movie that had its moments. ""The Bourne Identity"" had its action scenes wrapped around a bewitching puzzle -- who am I? ""Taken"" has none of that spark. It could have been written by some hack in a drugged stupor. Neeson does his usual best. He's aging but not too old for the part. Famke Janssen is mature too; still beautiful, still rangy, but ready for different parts now.<br/><br/>The most interesting feature of the movie was its villains. It's always interesting to see which kind of villain the benumbed minds of Hollywood will choose. For years it was Germans. Then the Cold War came along and it was Russians. There were odd bits of drug cartels here and there ten years ago. Arabs are beginning to show up. There is the occasional hybrid. ""Die Hard"" had a German gang, some of whom spoke with Russian accents. ""Crimson Tide"" and ""Air Force One"" had the Russians -- but splinter groups, not representing the Russian government.<br/><br/>""Taken"" uses ALBANIANS. Not the first time Albanians have been used, and for good reason. Albania has historically modeled itself on Mao's China. ""Tune in Tomorrow"" used Albanians in a parody of villainy, as did ""Wag the Dog."" The Albanians are taken seriously here. Well, why not? Nobody knows where Albania is except the Albanians. It's terra incognita. Vaguely associated with the Balkans -- as in ""Bosnia"" -- or the Middle East -- as in ""Iran."" And, what the hell, they don't have any movie theaters in Bosnia anyway so there's nothing to lose."

","OK, so Neeson's daughter is kidnapped by angry sex traders. So every girl Neeson comes across that has been taken by these guys has been drugged and raped surprise surprise Except for his daughter.<br/><br/>I have seen more believable bond movies than this. Neeson leaps around killing guys and seems to be invincible, this is ridiculous. This movie is not gritty in the slightest, characters are one dimensional and the storyline has more holes in it than Luc Bessen's reputation.<br/><br/>I hate this film with a passion, i WASTED 90 minutes of my life on a film i really thought was going to be adult and hard hitting. Instead it was a by the books, predictable, pile of squeaky clean American trash.<br/><br/>It was like watching an episode of the O.C, everything was clean and shiny and it sucked.<br/><br/>If you think that this film is worthy of a 5+ rating, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.

","I commend the makers of this great action film for leaving out all the cuss words that many movies of late have insisted upon blasting us with. It kept me at the edge of my seat and wide awake by using good English. Although, not by any means a religious movie, the stars quest to redeem his daughter from evil, to get her back at any cost, to take it personally when others did not,also made me thankful for all God has done to get his children back home and to rescue me personally. I will definitely be telling others about this movie and may even go see it again myself. I always get more the second time I see a film or read a book."

","A well-done shoot-em-up starring a great actor. Neeson projects the quiet competence/confidence of a professional agent/spy/thug very ably.<br/><br/>The movie had a plot hole or two but they weren't outrageous. My biggest gripe is how the good guys with pistols somehow manage to kill/take out the baddie with a machine pistol. Near the end of the movie Neeson should have been shot dead in the back but miraculously escapes harm from a spread of bullets. (Does this qualify as a spoiler?)<br/><br/>Tough subject matter and one wonders how true it is these days. Sexual enslavement of Eastern Bloc women has been going on for a decade or two but are tourists being targeted as depicted? Scary! <br/><br/>In any case, this is a good film with some well-deserved brutal justice handed out."

Liam Neeson gives a great performance, and although there are some plot holes (how the heck does he cause all of that mayhem without any ramifications, especially if the french government knows who he is?) it is still a great movie. It's like Bourne on Steroids. The fact that he actually kills almost everyone involved, is awesome, and he is a totally remorseless killer who doesn't even let middle men live. An amazing film, and great action. <br/><br/>Anyway - when does it get on there! I don't want it to be #1 or anything, but it should be recognized."

","This movie was what I wanted It was enjoyable and full of violence but parts were totally funny. It was great. I felt that Famke Jansen was perfect for the role since she always plays a total ball buster. The stepfather was henpecked and I remember him from from Mommy dearest. Maggie grace was perfect. Yes she was goofy at times but it just trying to show her innocence. Liam Neeson was brutal and brilliant at the same time.I felt that at certain parts I was like damn this is so messed up when you become a hence man for a living.

","This movie was wonderful. This was a powerful story and I enjoyed it from beginning to end. I would love to see more.<br/><br/>Luc Besson really knows how to tell a great and important story and bring in American money to the French film industry.<br/><br/>I love how Liam hurt people and worked over everyone the way they deserved. Because of this I felt like I was watching a real father pursue his daughter and doing what was necessary in every moment rather than hurting people in a manner that they could walk away unscathed.<br/><br/>The most important and smart decision in the film I thought was the choice to make the film PG-13. This was an excellent decision. Young women should see this film and hopefully become aware that they must be more aware of their surroundings and actions whether in their own country or abroad. This this film could have easily been steered in the wrong direction by showing more of the prostitution and drug side with nudity to attract an audience. Thankfully it was not done.<br/><br/>Why can't all movies be this good and pure?"

"Lejink","6","2","7","10 November 2008"," Junior Bourne
","The Bourne series appears to have rejuvenated the whole action-movie genre (even infecting the Bond franchise), in my opinion mostly for the better, with white-knuckle-ride thrills, conviction acting and contemporary settings now the norm where once there was Willis / Schwarzenegger cartoon excess. I know which I prefer as I say. This kidnap thriller certainly borrows heavily from the Bourne template, (not to mention Charles Bronson's ""Death Wish"", from an earlier era and even recent French thriller ""Tell No One"") with Liam Neeson metamorphosing from a seemingly ordinary average doting father into a driven, clinical but of course resourceful killing machine to rescue his teenage daughter from Algerian abductors in Paris. The film did though for me take a little too long to get going and suffers somewhat from too much sentimentality (of all things) particularly in the mawkish scenes between Neeson, his estranged wife, now a rich-man's plaything and their spoilt 17 year-old daughter. Disbelief suitably suspended though, Neeson incredibly tracks her down pretty much from scratch to a girl-trafficking syndicate where drugged-up teenagers are bid for in an eerily abhorrent ""auction"" by respectable-seeming businessmen, his character unsurprisingly racking up car-wrecks and body-count a-plenty. ""The Searchers"" it isn't and Neeson basically has to carry the film as he's by far the biggest name on board here but he certainly convinces as the expert retired intelligence operative, who snaps back into the groove under extreme provocation. The rest of the acting's nothing to write home about however and I feel the film could have benefited with better support and also by building up the Mr Big character a bit more as Neeson's nemesis. I also felt some of the action sequences were tricky to follow and fully engage with as the backgrounds were often unnecessarily dark and afflicted by a sort of staccato, stop-start camera style. The best action sequences in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", by contrast flow naturally in a sort of heightened real-time and often in broad daylight. For all its plagiarism however and other defects I've mentioned above, this was still a watchable almost-all-action movie for a Saturday night."
"cujo_leafs99","10","2","7","8 November 2008"," Exillerating Action!
","First off I didn't expect this movie to be that good but boy was I ever surprised. As the first 15 minutes took off I had no clue what direction the movie was going for but as soon as you know it the thrill/action starts. I am really impressed with this one. I absolutely love the raw action in it and Liam Neeson was brilliant. His character was extremely unbelievable and doesn't everyone wish they can kick ass like he does in this movie. The plot is great because it's a thrill ride till the very end and the whole pace of the movie just keeps flowing consistently throughout. These kinds of movies leave you thinking at the end about the world we live in and all the terrible things that can and often do go wrong all over the world. It really makes people think about their lives and shows how grateful everyone one should. I definitely recommend this to all movie lovers out there. You will not be disappointed with this. I give this a 10 out of 10 hands down."
"ebarnabas","10","2","7","5 November 2008"," A very good action film - Neeson as tough guy is new
","I sat down tonight with the thought in my mind, that I'd like to see a good action movie. I heard about ""Taken"" and the story concept seemed interesting, so I decided to watch it.<br/><br/>Well, let me tell Y'all, I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>This movie was great as action/drama/suspense mix. The fights were great, the storyline straight and clear, the characters developed enough.<br/><br/>Another commenter said, that this film has some of the makings of the ""Bourne"" movies. Let me second on that. Neeson plays a man, who takes a 'no b*****it' approach to solving a problem while employing a great deal of tricks and the art of his former trade. Pretty much like Jason Bourne. Also the pace of the film is somewhat comparable.<br/><br/>I am not saying that the film is equal to the ""Bourne"" trilogy in all sense, but if y'all like to see a good and exciting action flick, I'd definitely recommend this one.<br/><br/>However, do not watch it expecting the answers to society's problems, like corruption, drugs, prostitution and so on. You won't get anything in that department. But if you are a father or ever want to be, you'll probably get the feeling, that ""yeah, this is what I'd like to do, or at least it would be nice to try and do, if MY daughter ever got in the hands of these kind of people"".<br/><br/>Enjoy the movie!"

The entire movie you felt his angst and determination. Unlike many action movies, everything seemed completely plausible. You will never say, ""No way!"" You will cheer, you will rethink your own dedication to your family. <br/><br/>This will be one of those movies, for me, like the Die Hards, etc. that when I see it on, no matter what point in the movie, I will stop and watch."

The acting is really great, the story is very very good, the ending is awesome. I couldn't ask for anything more in this movie. Everything is in moderation and the plot is also very realistic.

If Quantum Of Solace isn't the best film this year then Taken certainly is. The trailer doesn't really show a lot of the brilliant and many many action scenes but it does show the instantly classic line delivered by Neeson on the phone, which I would say is right up there with such classic lines as ""Go ahead, make my day"". I would recommend this fantastic movie to anyone who enjoys good action and appreciates good acting. Although it is a total action fest it is more than a typical action movie like Rambo 3 or Eraser, it has got some really brilliant talent and tackles real life issues superbly."

","I was very disappointed in this movie. It was a great movie, but very much similar to the book I wrote in 2004 'Illegal Goodbye' by Angela Jobe published by Virtualbookworm. I had people come and tell me it was a lot like my book, but I hadn't seen the movie, so I had to see for myself. At first I thought some scenes were just a coincident, but after seeing the end, now I don't think so at all. The movie is based on two girls being taken from the airport, my book is two girls being abducted from a mall and taken to the country Turkey and thrown into the black market. In the movie...one girl was hesitant about going with the guy and the other girl wanted to go....same as my book. In the movie the father will do anything to find his daughter..my book her twin, along with her father will do anything to find her. The part that blows me away the most is the auction at the end...just like my book...too many similarities! Extremely disappointed."

To those who did, this one is hilarious.<br/><br/>I have been through some of the comments after watching the film.

","So how many of these movies have we seen? This theme of a middle aged man going in search of his kidnapped daughter has been done countless times. Therefore I was quite surprised to see this movie now considering this theme is so overused now.<br/><br/>There is not much deviation from the formula. The middle man aged man Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson) has just sent his daughter unwillingly to a Europe trip. His daughter gets kidnapped by Albanian traffickers and he sets out to rescue his daughter and kill the bad guys in the process. There is also the cliché of immigrant guys involved in prostitution. There is a message that young girls shouldn't go out to unknown countries, bad things are always right in the corner(does this rule apply to young boys btw?). In the end the character, as usual, faces the whole prostitution ring(all by himself) and rescues his daughter.<br/><br/>The more I see Famke Jennsen, the more I am convinced she shouldn't be acting in movies at all. She literally sleepwalks through her role. It is amazing her beauty is not interesting enough to keep me interested. I haven't seen any other movies of Liam Neeson but he seems quite forgettable in this. He does the standard tough guy role who doesn't need to show emotions much. The depictions of immigrants are quite disturbing, to say the least. The lack of action scenes is another problem. It isn't complex enough to be a thriller to be a psychological thriller type of movie. And it isn't fast enough to be called an action movie.<br/><br/>The rewatchability factor is non existent and it is not even worth for one watch. Okay for this genre but it is a reason why recent action movies haven't really caught the attention of the viewers. The lack of originality and the clichéd treatment is the main problem here.<br/><br/>Overall 4/10"

","Predictable from start to finish. Mediocre performances across the board, including Neeson, who you feel was stifled by the script and direction. An earlier review suggested this was very much like ""Man on Fire"". Believe me, they are worlds apart. On paper they tick very similar boxes, but where Man on Fire slowly built tension, made you care for the characters via stellar performances and solid dialogue, and plot twists aplenty, Taken merely plods though the usual juxtaposed strands to achieve it's superficial outcomes. Where you could almost feel the heat of Mexico City seeping out of the screen with Man on Fire, the arctic chill of emptiness and apathy blow through this. It's all thrown together quite nicely, with some impressive cinematography along the way, but as the saying goes, ""you can put a dress on a pig, but it's still a pig"".<br/><br/>Could have been worse. Could also have been a damn sight better."

","Age difference of the daughter. Taking a 25yr old actress that look older then her actual age to act as a 17 year old girl, calls a really bad judgment. Her acting is bad too. Worst part, she is in Taken, Taken 2 and there is going to be Taken 3. The story is good. A lot of teenage girls, young ladies and a lot of parents making bad decision that actually brings to this situation. Sadly, this is still happening as we speak.

While doing that, he used the identity of a French intelligence service agent but he was still speaking English with Albanian's living in France!

","""I will find you and I will kill you"", CIA retiree, Liam Neeson says resolutely to one of his daughter's kidnappers. We know he'll follow through on his promise too. It's great to see Liam back on the screen in this tailor made role, kicking butt, but really folks, this is an overrated movie. Neeson's a character you don't want to mess with and these Albanion scum have messed with his daughter. He's been trained to kill, and this is basically what he's gonna do to everyone involved here, one an old friend of Neesons. His daughter and her friend are vacationing in Paris or France, I'm not sure. Within hours of their arrival, where the friend has already met her Romeo, the two girls are snatched and are sold into a sex slavery, Grace's friend not so lucky. So it's Liam to the rescue, trawling the streets for his loved one and pulling some deadly moves on his oppressors. The auctioning scene near the end, where the girls, drugged, virtually walking zombies, are shown singularly into a room, first cloaked with a brides's gown as such, before it's whipped off, is the most fascinating as it's unforgettable. The bidders sit above in booths, a female V.O outlining the girl's assets, before starting with figures. Apparently Grace is the best import, so she's the last girl to be auctioned, not unless Liam has something to say about it. He sure knows how to break up a party. Taken to me wasn't anything special. It needed more input into it's story, if it's characters too. At least it ends, happily for Grace, back in the loving arms of her father. Some nice stunt work near it's gripping final. Holly Valance has a small role, doing what she does best. She's Grace's character's idol, who first tells Grace to not waste her time."
"commander_zero","5","1","3","8 August 2012"," Liam Takes Paris--takes it for all it's worth.
","As exciting, well-made, fast-paced Hollywood thrillers go, it is hard to match Taken for sheer loathsomeness. Retired operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) lives alone on his CIA pension, his life taken up with barbecue nights with his CIA old-boy group, and with obsessing over his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), who is about to go on a trip to Paris with a girlfriend. Substitute ""Paris"" for ""Bangkok red-light district"" and you will get an idea of how Dad reacts to the idea of his little girl on her own in the City of Light. Considering that his face-to-face interactions with Kim and her mother (Famke Janssen) are hopelessly awkward, Bryan's obsession with his memories and his photo album, though played for pathos, start to seem a little creepy. But Dad's paranoia turns out to be well- founded; before Kim can unpack her toothbrush, the Albanian slave trade scoop up her and best girlfriend Amanda. On the phone with Kim while the kidnapping takes place, Bryan has just enough time to hear a few clues before he's begging his ex-wife's rich new husband for a private jet to get him to Paris in the 96 hours after which, authorities tell him, she will ""disappear forever.""<br/><br/>The trouble is, EVERYONE in Paris is in cahoots with the Albanian slavers. For all the help he gets, Bryan might as well have stayed in Los Angeles, taking on Disney, human smuggling and the Mexican drug trade. In this film from a French writer, director and producer, the French are all slimebags; even Bryan's old friend & fellow agent Jean- Claude (Olivier Rabourdin) refuses to get involved (Irish actor Neeson nails his American accent when he pronounces his old buddy's name ""John- Clod"") and when Bryan persists, amps up his resistance. The Albanians, and their chief clients the Arabs, are even worse. Bryan gets to revive his old skills, shooting, stabbing and breaking necks as if he was in his prime; almost no one he meets in Paris doesn't end up dead, and to a man they're the better for it. Fortunately at one point when Bryan gets in too deep, he is saved by that old standby; the pipe which has that one essential loose bracket the hero needs, and which also contains that pressurized steam which—at least in action movies—seems to be the lifeblood of large buildings—nothing so banal as the electricity or natural gas we use in real life. In the end, according to one IMDb contributor, Bryan kills 35 people to get his daughter back. But he fails to win our sympathy. Not once in Taken is he given a hint of the self-deprecating humour which is the hallmark of the successful action hero. Dour, socially awkward, good only at murder, he is a man better off on his own. Once off the plane, his evidently untraumatized daughter, bubbly as ever after her ordeal, rushes into her mother's arm with great relief; no doubt even worse than 4 days with Albanian slavers has been a trans-Atlantic flight next to her dour dad. And Famke Janssen—of whom we see too little—is clearly better off with the rich guy."

","I found this movie quite exhausting to watch and I was tempted to walk out (of my own house) before reaching the very predictable end. <br/><br/>I like to evaluate films on the basis of what they aim to achieve. In my humble opinion this is just another clichéd 'one American takes on a whole army such that he can locate his missing relative' film. To deny this works sometimes would be silly of me, as films like Polansky's Frantic and Scott's Man on Fire do a great job. <br/><br/>It's a little similar to another film of Harrison Ford's- Firewall, but this has a slightly more interesting pretext. Kidnapping in my opinion is a great focus of a thriller or action film, it's just that Taken completely lacks the acting, the plot and a good soundtrack. With one you can make the greatest film of all time, with none it's a disaster. 4/10. Go watch Frantic instead!"

This movie starts with an extremely bizarre premise, and it kept presenting more and more improbable, impossible and unbelievably exaggerated crimes and heavily stereotyped bad guys.<br/><br/>But it delivered all the action and gun-flinging that you can expect from a ""rogue ex-agent rescues his daughter"" kind of movie.

I found the plot entertaining, however, this movie contains old cliché movie gimmicks in respect to the action contained in the film.<br/><br/>Particularly on the boat, Liam Neeson seems to kill all enemies without taking any damage.

","I took a look a Taken out of curiosity when I read the premise, and could not have believed what I was about to experience, let alone find out later it was a French production. It seems Hollywood just doesn't want to give audiences what they want to see, but Taken does deliver justice in every possible way that a moviegoer could dream of.<br/><br/>Through every scene I found my self with my mouth open saying, ""That's what I would of had happen!"" How many times do we see in movies like Fast and Furious where even ""tough guy"" Dom won't blast the bad guy when he has a chance? Taken is the complete opposite. Every opportunity to kill a bad guy is judiciously taken advantage of. I have never been more thrilled by a movie, and everyone I know enjoyed it for the same reasons I did.<br/><br/>In short I would recommend Hollywood make enjoyable movies like Taken, and stop being so philosophical and weak when dealing with the bad guys."

We have many energetic action moments, but very few intelligent and creative ones. To say it with few words : intense action, few surprises.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson was what I call: the main event, because I've always looked at him like an icon of caring and mildness. This time is just as lethal as an AK-47, or M16 the American version of AK-47 :) Didn't care too much about the girl, I almost wanted her dead , she was annoyingly stupid, too stupid if you ask me.<br/><br/>Taken, however doesn't intend to be extravagant, it sticks to the point ant that is very important for me.

","Neeson's character, Bryan Mills, is referred to Rambo by some of his ex spy buddies in the beginning of the film.

It wasn't believable.<br/><br/>Mills daughter, Kim, goes to Paris with a friend and gets kidnapped a few hours after arriving. It just so happens she is talking to her dad when the kidnappers strike.

Her dad just saved her from being a sex slave and she doesn't even want him to come home with her.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It has some good action, but I think the lead actor was miscast. But still good enough to check out."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","1","3","9 September 2009"," For Paunchy Fathers Everywhere...
","This is one of those films you enjoy even though you know it's slick and glossy and totally dumb. It contains nothing original, has trite dialogue, an indefensibly heavy dependence on coincidence and luck, narrative signposts that a visually impaired simpleton wearing a blindfold could read in the middle of a blackout, and super-heroic antics from an ageing leading man that in reality would have him reaching for a comfy chair for a sit down within five minutes of the chase beginning. And yet the film's action sequences are so well-staged that they somehow manage to hold it all together and stop you from reaching for the stop button on your remote.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson plays a prematurely retired government agent. He's one of those amiable but secretive men who never tell their family what it is that he really does, choosing instead to lend himself an air of mystery by explaining that he was a 'preventer,' i.e. someone who prevented bad things from happening. He tells this to his virginal teen daughter which is when you first suspect that the writer isn't just aiming for the usual 17-24 demographic here but is also reaching out to every pot-bellied, slouch-shouldered, balding middle-aged dad who has seen their life pass them by but who console themselves with the fact that they've at least raised some reasonably decent kids (even though they feel totally alienated from them and probably don't know where they are or what they're doing 85% of the time).<br/><br/>Anyway, against his better judgment, Liam allows his daughter to go on a holiday to Paris with her best friend and, wouldn't you know it, they go and get themselves kidnapped by a gang of Albanians. Typical. You let them out of your sight for five minutes. At least that's one good thing about the dispensing of barriers in Europe: us Brits, so long the villainous figure of Hollywood flicks, have now been usurped by the East European.<br/><br/>Neeson calls on his security pals for help and, using only a few seconds of taped conversation, a small piece of string and an empty Fairy Liquid bottle, they are able to identify not only the ring leader of the gang but where he used to live. Personally, I'd have shelled out for mates like that to come with me to Paris, but Liam's made of sterner stuff and flies out on his own. And within something like two-and-a-half minutes of arriving in Paris he's on the trail of the young dude who groomed the girls for abduction.<br/><br/>OK, so this film isn't really to be taken seriously, even though it doesn't really seem to have much of a sense of humour about itself. Like most films of this genre, if there is any obstacle to the logic or progression of the story it is either ignored completely or summarily dispensed with through the use of a throwaway line. That's why nobody thinks to tell the parents of the second girl that their little precious has just become a statistic in the human trafficking/sexual slavery figures. And it's why nobody in Paris has noticed that lithe young female tourists to the city are regularly disappearing within hours of getting off their planes. It's why Neeson has no trouble making himself understood in a foreign country, and why every Albanian gangster in Paris has an excellent grasp and command of the English language. It's why Neeson can identify his daughter's spotter through a hazy reflection of him taking her photograph on her mobile phone. And it's why a drunken and drugged girl can remember the name of the street in which she was imprisoned as her captors turn her into a junkie ready to turn onto the streets.<br/><br/>And the reason I highlight all these weaknesses, inconsistencies and flaws of the film isn't so much to damn it as to emphasise how surprising it is that I managed to enjoy so much of what was going on. The action scenes are the kind of highly-charged, adrenaline-pumping set-pieces that sometimes have you forgetting to breath, and the makers are canny enough to know that this is where the real strength of the film lies. Because when you strip the story down to its bare essentials – innocent young heroine plucked from the warmth and security of her family to become the plaything of a wealthy but villainous sheik – you're talking about a plot that was old in the 1920s. And Liam Neeson's hair-raising escapades and last-minute escapes are straight out of those old boys-own serials of the 30s."

"zardoz-13","8","1","3","2 February 2009"," ""Taken"" is Good, But It's No ""Commando.""
","The new Liam Neeson kidnap thriller ""Taken"" qualifies as both entertaining and predictable. Ostensibly, the message here is parents should think twice before they turn their fun-loving, 17-year old daughters loose in Paris, France, without an escort. ""District B-13"" director Pierre Morel appropriates many of the clichés and conventions of kidnapping thrillers, but he ramps up the violence marginally for this PG-13 thriller while suspending any vestige of realism. The result is an exciting and suspenseful yarn about a ""Rambo"" style father who takes names and kicks butt. <br/><br/>Although it doesn't concern ransom demands, ""Taken"" resembles the 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger kidnap thriller ""Commando."" However, ""Taken"" isn't half as good as the Schwarzenegger saga. Mind you, Neeson's sympathetic performance as a doting, never-say-die dad in pursuit of the evildoers who abducted his only daughter keeps things interesting. The villains in the formulaic screenplay by Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen, who together wrote both ""The Transporter"" and ""Kiss of the Dragon,"" are as sleazy as maggots. The problem is no one single actor or character emerges who can match Neeson blow for blow. Big dumb action thrillers need a chief villain that we can genuinely loathe and that the hero can lock horns with in a struggle to the death. ""Taken"" assembles too many trigger-happy miscreants that Neeson dispatches as easily as ten-pins in a bowling alley.<br/><br/>""Taken"" finds former CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson of ""Schindler's List"") living in Los Angeles so he can be near his estranged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace of TV's ""Lost"") who lives with her mother, Lenore (Famke Janssen of ""GoldenEye""), and Stuart (Xander Berkeley of ""Air Force One"")her affluent stepfather. Lenore and Bryan were divorced years ago because Bryan's job as a 'preventer' for Langley kept him from spending quality time not only with Kim but also her mother. Lenore has nothing but contempt for Bryan and does her best to keep him at arm's length from Kim. Indeed, Bryan lost his job with 'the Company' because he flew 9-thousand miles to celebrate Kim's birthday while he was on duty elsewhere in the world. <br/><br/>Morel and his scenarists stress Bryan's deep love for his daughter. They show him pasting Kim's new photos into a scrapbook that contains pictures from each birthday. Bryan finds himself out-classed by Stuart at Kim's 17th birthday party when he gives her a karaoke player while Stuart gives her a horse. Kim still loves Bryan, but she is growing up and a girl has to do what a girl has to do, especially when her best friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy of ""Black Christmas"") persuades her to fly with her to Paris to stay with her relatives. Before Kim can accompany Amanda, she has to get Bryan's written authorization, but our hero doesn't like the set-up. He worries about what could happen to them, even though Kim assures him that they will only be touring museums. Reluctantly, Bryan breaks down and signs the form, but he demands that Kim take an international cell phone with his number programmed into it.<br/><br/>No sooner have the girls landed than Amanda gets the 'hots' for a Parisian pretty boy named Peter (Nicolas Giraud of ""Second Soufflé"") who shares a taxi with them. In this respect, ""Taken"" recalls the R-rated ""Hostel"" where sexy girls lured lusty lads into a death trap in Eastern Europe. Peter invites them to a party, but the girls never make it. Peter phones a gang of grimy Albanians that operate a white slavery ring. In other words, they shanghai young girls, pump them full of narcotics, and force them into prostitution. Kim is on the phone with Bryan when the villains invade the apartment where Amanda's relatives live. Unfortunately, Amanda's relatives are gone on a vacation, too. Bryan coaches Kim about what to do even as the thugs come after her and drag her out from under a bed.<br/><br/>Predictably, Lenore is distraught when she learns what has happened. Bryan's CIA buddies provide our hero with a wealth of information about the Albanians. They inform Bryan, however, that he has only 96 hours before he will lose Kim forever. Essentially, Kim will be sold to the highest bidder and be a sex slave until she dies. Bryan has Stuart arrange air passage for him to Paris, and our hero pulls out his black bag of tricks. Bryan contacts an old colleague with French intelligence, Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin of ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc""), but he wants Bryan to leave the country. Bryan warns his old friend that he is prepared to tear down the Eiffel Tower to get his daughter back. Secretly, Jean-Claude assigns a team to shadow Bryan. Eventually, Bryan locates the Albanians and inflicts heavy losses on them, but cannot find Kim. Bryan manages to rescue a girl who may know of Kim's whereabouts. He helps her recover from the drugs that the villains have injected in her, and she gives Bryan a lead. <br/><br/>Ten years ago Harrison Ford would probably have played Liam Neeson's part. Meanwhile, Neeson behaves believably enough to convince us that he is as a savvy as Matt Damon's Jason Bourne and can get into and out of the toughest predicaments imaginable. Bryan shoots, stabs, kills, fights, and tortures the treacherous Albanians until he gets what he wants. Indeed, Neeson resembles an indestructible Steven Seagal hero who can triumph over well-nigh impossible odds. Famke Janssen is relegated to the thankless role of the distraught mother, and Maggie Grace is hopelessly clueless as Kim. The Parisian locales look gritty enough, and our hero has his hands full the whole time, right up to the final gunfight on a sheik's yacht.<br/><br/>Despite its paucity of realism and reliance on clichés, ""Taken"" benefits from Neeson's stalwart performance and Morel's vigorous staging of the action that never loses its momentum throughout its nimble 93 minutes."

","For all of you fellow Liam Neeson fans, you must see this! It is a great recovery from his role in Love Actually (which is a completely respectable film), and it's the first time in a while that he seemed really into his character. This movie definitely shows a darker side of him, a bad-ass side. Refreshing, it is. Makes you realize that actors don't have to be type-cast all the time. And Maggie Grace, though her role can be described as little more than a cameo, gave a convincing performance. I think the under the bed scene was a little overdone on her part, almost like she was in a hokey low-budget horror film. Anyway, the plot is decent, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and is worth your buck."

Liam Neeson does his magic, playing the lead role as the man you don't want to mess with. Besides the great acting in the movie, when it comes to the action scenes, he proves that he is more than capable of picking a fight. In other words: they couldn't have done a better job casting him as the lead character. As for director Pierre Morel, well all I can say is, I am looking forward to seeing what he does next. So next time you are at a theater, and you are looking for some action, put your money on this one, cause it is a good one. Hope you like it as well."

Any plot holes can be easily ignored as the film is smoothly paced and very well delivered.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is fantastic from the start. From the strain of the disconnection he is suffering with his daughter, to the anguish of what transpires to her in the kidnapping and then his training allowing cold hard ruthless devotion to her recovery, Liam's characterisation of Bryan allows you to both empathise with his predicament, and appreciate his employment of said spy skills in pursuing the bad guys.<br/><br/>If this film didn't have someone of Liam's talent as the lead I don't think it would have worked. If you get on board with his character's point of view you're in for quite a ride."

That's one of those difficult ones to find out. Probably in the mix there's more of an action movie than a thriller but still a very enjoyable piece. <br/><br/>Everything goes to fast, straight-forward. You don't have time to breath. It's true that it doesn't allow you to play with the movie cause it gives you no time to think. Don't look here for a psychological thriller cause is not.

He basically just kills everyone he sees that isn't her daughter and hell hath no fury like a roaring rampage of revenge. The sleek action scenes were just downright gritty. There's no wires involved, no gratuitous back flips or slow-mo flying kicks. Its all bare knuckles, street fighting brawl. Great choreography I must say and as it may slightly resemble the Bourne movies, Taken stands on its own feet as a high octane action thriller.<br/><br/>Frenchman extraordinaire Luc Besson co-wrote the screenplay and his right hand man Pierre Morel directs.

","While it is a good action movie if you can edit it to some degree the rating is completely wrong. In no way is this a PG-13 movie. This movie should not be seen by anyone under the age of 18 at the very least. Prostitution is the main theme of the movie, contains nudity, violence and a lot of foul language. This should be rated R at the very least!! Besides that there is no need for the nudity as the prostitution is implied and therefore does not require a visual. In addition to that there is no need for the language. It doesn't make a movie. It is a factor which can determine if I even watch the movie. Liam Neeson is an excellent actor I really enjoy his movies. That is the only reason that I even watched this movie. Overall take out the language and the nudity and it would be pretty good movie."

We need more heroes like these, not just in movies, but in real life.

"ElMaruecan82","8","1","4","13 February 2013"," Liam Neeson, the perfect combination of ""badass"" and ""sensitivity"" ...
","Bryan Mills is a former CIA's operative whose longtime dedication earned him on one side ""special skills"" (mostly rhyming with kills) and cost him on the other side, his marriage.<br/><br/>As a secret agent, he's a combination of James Bond and Steven Seagal but as a husband, not so much. Yet you wonder what his wife Lenore (Famke Jensen) was expecting since she didn't marry a baker or an accountant, but looking at her post-divorce lifestyle and her new rich husband, she naturally feels triumphant over Bryan. But Bryan's attention is focused on his 17-year old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), he retired for a bodyguard job to spend more time with her. And there's a sort of genuine bond between both. And Liam Neeson is always believable as the misunderstood and hurt father.<br/><br/>In twenty minutes, the characters are all set-up, with more or less two-three dimensionality, Kim wants to become a singer, Bryan tries to connect her with a pop artist he protected from an assailant. He bought her a karaoke machine at her birthday, but her step-father out stepped him by offering the most predictable but no less efficient gift: a horse, and not any horse, one that makes the ill-fated ""Khartoom"" from ""The Godfather"" looks like a pony. The tone is clear, Kim is a cute, spoiled little girl and it's a miracle she didn't turn as bitchy and arrogant as her mother. And the conflict with the mother starts when she allows Kim to travel to Paris, and 'discover the world' with her friend. One step further, she would have bought condoms for her.<br/><br/>The script doesn't embarrass itself with subtlety as we immediately take side with Bryan who faces ungratefulness every time. He finds out that the travel in Paris is only the first step to a U2's European tour the two girls want to attend, he doesn't even know that the 'cousins' supposed to chaperon them are in travel. Reluctant to let her girl go, he finally resigns but gives her a cell-phone so she can call him from the international area: his very instinct just saved Kim. I spend time to describe the set-up because the action sequences only work because they rely on a very solid characterization: we follow the film less for the action, than Bryan's motives and the sympathetic feeling Neeson's eyes never cease to inspire.<br/><br/>The action takes off when Kim and her friend Amanda are kidnapped by Albanian human traffickers, luckily, Kim has enough time to tell Bryan that strangers came to the house. Bryan knows she'll be kidnapped he tells her to hide under the closest bed and describe the men with as much details as she can, anything can be helpful. She leaves a few indications, but enough to help Bryan to track down the whole network from this point to the end. According to Bryan's friend, the Albanians started abducting foreign travelers and after four days, there are chances Kim would be sold, and it would be impossible to find him. All Bryan has are his martial arts skills, his intelligence, his electronic expertise, his fatherly determination and 96 hours.<br/><br/>Bryan is like a combo or John Matrix r in ""Commando"" or Jack Bauer from the TV series ""24"", except that Liam Neeson has a quality in his acting, so efficient that you never see the 'superhero' he is, but the determined father. Without Liam Neeson, there are chances that ""Taken"" wouldn't have be 'taken' as seriously and be reduced to another action/thriller movie with a relatively conventional plot, which is actually the case, but one casting, towering in every meaning of the word, all the others is enough to elevate the film, into one of the best and most gripping action/thrillers of the 2000's. And if not the best, it certainly is the most memorable, through its capacity to build fresh material out of new stuff.<br/><br/>""A great film consists of three good scenes, and no bad scene"", this is the statement of Howard Hawks, I used in some other reviews. Many would spot plot holes or unbelievable scenes, but one bad scene can only be judged on the way it ruins the whole narrative or make us lose our focus. No scene does that, foreign clichés, action overdose, chase, their flaws are forgettable because they all work as links between a few great scenes that redeem all the archetypes, and there are three great scenes in ""Taken"".<br/><br/>First, in a year rich in impacting movies such as ""Slumdog Millionaire"", ""Milk"" or ""The Dark Knight"", ""Taken"" takes the cake as the most memorable exchange during the infamous father-and-daughter phone that ends with Bryan's speech ordering the 'bad guy', whoever he is, to release the girl, and he'll forget everything, otherwise, he'll track him, find him and execute him. The following ""good luck"" with a strong accent is the trigger of Bryan's chase, and makes the confrontation even more 'electrifying'. Finally, Bryan contradicts all the stereotypes of the tough-guy-with-principles by shooting a harmless woman on the arm and threatens to kill her, if her husband doesn't give the information. Not only we believe he means business, but we still like him, hell, even Dirty Harry wouldn't have got away with that.<br/><br/>These three moments elevated the film above the usual standards of a simple cat-and-mouse thriller. What do they all have in common? They rely on the menacing presence of Liam Neeson, and his human look on the eyes, this unique capability to look strong and sensitive, to inspire our immediate sympathy. ""Taken"" has taken me totally off-guard, and although it's not flawless, and some characters are either underdeveloped or stereotypical, the film has an exhilarating straight-forward direction, as if the director, Pierre Morel was confident on the movie's potential and never tried to 'over-humanize' it, Bryan Mills carries the whole humanity.<br/><br/>And this is saying a lot for an action/thriller movie hero."

","Probably one of my favourite films I've seen! I love every second of it! The Action, the small parts of comedy, the strength of characters, the use of characters! the whole film is very easy to understand, it has a clear story and good use of actors. only one bad thing to mention. why start with the book of photos? little bit confusing. i really do like this film. you just know what hes thinking but in a way that you cannot predict his moves. you really get to like his action for his daughter and that no compromise or any change will make him change his mind. he is on a mission and he knows how to prove his point! specially with a gun pointed at Jeane Claude :P correct me if i have spelt that wrong! He clearly knows what he is doing but he cannot do everything in an instant. there are parts where timing is key. if i had to describe one it would be when he waited for a chance to get inside the apartment and find out clues to find out where his daughter went. it went from small clue to other small clue. really fantastic story! :D My OPINION i love this film it has good action, easy story and fantastic finish! I really recommend this film and i love the way it has its ups and downs but it all ends with a good finish. :) Thanks guys and happy reviewing!"

"schuyler-powers","3","1","4","28 August 2012"," Great Concept, Shabby Attempt
","Hello fellow movie goer! I am here today to tell you the review of Taken. Such a great concept for a movie: A former CIA specialist is troubled by the taking of his daughter by sex traffickers while she goes on a trip to France. So he goes out and saves her. That is the basic plot of the movie. It's a cool and action-packed sounding concept, but was it pulled off good? Nope! This movie ended up being not just action packed in a good way, but over the top. Where the dad (former CIA agent) gets in the middle of heated gunfights or fights against 3 or 4 men, he barely even receives a scratch. Now i know not all movies are really realistic but I at least like seeing the protagonist who's fighting struggle a little bit, other than the whole conflict. Also i noticed during the movie that Liam Nesson, who plays as the father, kills just about every single person that gets in his way. He even shoots his friend's wife and almost kills her, because the friend has trafficked women before. Then the father even tells the friend that he'd kill his the mas kids too if he didn't help. Kind of too much right? Now I'm not saying it's so bad that it's unwatchable, but in my opinion it's just an entertaining, rent a one time movie kind of thing. So try it out if you think you'd like it but if not, I completely agree. Thank you for reading this review."

"valrogm","10","1","4","30 March 2011"," Scary, exciting action movie with family appeal
","Liam Neeson plays a retired secret agent who's divorced and has a daughter who lives with his ex-wife. Without going into spoilers, his daughter is kidnapped and we get to see Neeson hunt down the kidnappers and rescue his daughter.<br/><br/>I thought that one of the strong points of the movie was the realistic setting. The bad guys are new slavers in the world - slavery may have been banned in the U.S. long ago, but tell that to the girls who are trafficked and forced into prostitution. These criminals are real and exist in almost every country, and unfortunately society looks the other way.<br/><br/>Personifying the person who looks the other way is Jean-Claude, played by Olivier Rabourdin, who has a wife and two daughters whom he hugs while ignoring, and in fact aiding, the sex slavery of girls just like them.<br/><br/>Neeson gives a superb performance in the movie. He's a great actor who can comfortably act in dramas and action movies with equal ease.<br/><br/>My only gripe with the movie was that Mills (Neeson) was unnecessarily made to defeat all the bad guys by himself. As great as Neeson's acting was, that decision was unfortunate, considering the realistic setting of the movie. We were introduced to several other extremely skilled ex-secret agents in the beginning. Why couldn't they have joined Mills? Four of them against the traffickers would have been believable. The director could have gone the Action Movie route without sacrificing believability."

","I am curious why reviewers here rate this movie above the Bourne trilogy. When Liam fights his opponents crumple up like folding paper. He utilizes old-style jujitsu moves and moves stiffly like a middle-aged man. For some unknown reason he wades in everywhere no matter what the odds. He is also invulnerable to bullets as shown by the chaser at the construction site shooting point blank at him and Liam just shrugs the bullets away. How he knew where the construction site was puzzled me too. Clearly he loses his head all the time he is in France, so why did he not call in his friends and really do a good job?"

","Neeson simply carried this film with a no nonsense kick ass approach. I have ALWAYS wanted an action hero to take charge in a realistic way (James Bond is too comic book, but Craig comes closest to what Neeson does here). I love the scene where he blasts first as he seeks answers from the scumbags.<br/><br/>Maggie Grace was excellent in LOST and she plays the same role here, several years younger than her actual age, and she does it well. Until she grows out of the perfect 90210 looking babe, she will be typecast...but she has real talent so her time will come...unless she wants to do soap operas her entire life.<br/><br/>SEE this movie if you have not. This crap is real and it happens in our world.

"freemantle_uk","4","1","4","29 August 2009"," Completely Dumb Violence Actioner
","The film Taken was a surprise hit. From a budget of $25 million this film made $145 million in the American box-office, and $221 million worldwide. It made Pierre Morel's career as a director and some people on IMDb have touted him as a potential Bond director and shows at the tender age of 56 that Liam Neeson can be an action star. But is this film any good? In my opinion, sadly not.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a retired CIA agent whom career led to the break up of his marriage and missing important time with his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Bryan stay in contact with some of his CIA buddies and even does some bodyguard work, including saving a young singer played by Holly Valance. Kim has just turned 17 and wants to be a singer. Her friend invites her to go to Paris for the summer and follow U2 on their first European tour (what 17-year-old girl listens to U2?). Bryan warns her, saying that Paris is a dangerous place to go, but lets her. After being in Paris for a few hours Kim and her friend are kidnapped, as happens to every teenage girl who goes to Paris, and Bryan has to use his skills to go use to find his daughter. He has 96 hours before Kim would be addicted to drugs and never be found.<br/><br/>The good points of the film are there are some good action sequence, especially with its budget, Maggie Grace isn't bad playing a teenager and its good to see Liam Neeson in a leading role (even if he has a weird accent). That's it! The plot is simple; I have nothing against simple plots, but there is a fine line from simple and enjoyable to completely stupid. Sex Trafficking and the sex trade are complex subjects and are terribly mishandled in this film. If it wasn't for the fact that film was directed by a Frenchmen, and written and produced by Luc Besson, then it could have easily been made by American neo-cons. As I said, within hours the girls are kidnapped and that Paris is a city unsafe for Americans. Paris is no different to any other city in the world. All non-Americans are stereotypes, the French are corrupt and there is a very simple black and white morality in this world, even if the large amount of torture used. It is a very one-dimensional world, from the set-up to the characterisation. This is a film for xenophobic Americans.<br/><br/>The film also plays like an extended episode of the show 24. Bryan Mills is basically Jack Bauer who is in a race against time. He uses torture to great affect and doesn't seem bothered by the consequences. But at least in this film, Bryan is doing it to find his daughter, not on behalf of the American government. The action of the film is also much like the action in 24, with elements of Paul Greengrass' Bourne films; over-edited and a lot of shaky cam (I don't like that). An element I liked was that Bryan was an older action hero, but seems too good, finding things with ease and getting out of situations without many problems.<br/><br/>This film isn't that good. I expect better from Luc Besson; he is the man who gave us Leon and the Fifth Element."
"Aaron1375","9","1","4","11 June 2009"," Why daughters should always listen to their dads.
","This is a movie about a guy who does what he says in the most extreme manner possible. A father trying to reestablish himself in his daughters life has quit his job and is now living closer to where she is. He tries, but his ex wife does not seem to care for him much at all from what I got at that birthday party. Well something comes up, a chance for his daughter to take a trip to France with a friend and she needs her dad's permission to go to another country. Against his better judgment he agrees with conditions. Well they get to France and it is not anytime before the girls do something incredibly stupid and they later end up being taken as it were by men whose intentions are later spelled out. Well father now uses what he learned from his old job to track down these men and when he finds them, for the most part it is not pretty. Granted, I enjoyed seeing him do it as all these guys are scum. The movie has great action and it flows very fast. Nice to have a film that does not seem long at all. It is just fun pulling for this guy to get his hands on the bad guys. I think Liam Neeson being in the movie as the father adds something to this movie as he does a very good job. He makes a rather good movie even better just like he did in the movie ""Darkman"". So for a movie with lots of action, some thrills and a few tense moments Taken is your movie."
"scottmwade-1","9","1","4","5 June 2009"," Great action flick
","One of the best action flicks I've seen. Highly recommend this movie if you like intense action films. I thought Neeson's character's overbearing protectiveness was a little excessive but that was the only thing I could find to complain about, and that isn't much. Lots of great chase scenes brawls and shootouts. Not sure just how accurate the portrayal of the sex slaving industry is but it seemed fairly believable to me. The bad guys seemed genuinely evil and got what they deserved. I never figured Neeson for an action star before but he came through with flying colors in my opinion. I'm hoping they make some kind of sequel, I'd watch it for sure."
"irish_leslie43","9","1","4","31 May 2009"," Good guys triumph
","I liked this movie. Lots of action, suspense, car chases, fist-fights and gun totin' baddies. I was dismayed to imagine that young people traveling abroad are in danger of being abducted and no one seems to be doing anything about it. I hope that's not true. I like a fast-paced movie and this certainly fit the bill. Good father/daughter scenes. Would watch this movie again - probably several times. I am a true Liam Neeson fan and wish he made more movies. ""Michael Collins"" is my favorite, along with ""Rob Roy"" (in which Tim Roth - now of Lie To Me fame - plays the best and most evil guy ever), and coming soon ""The Red Circle"" with Orlando Bloom. I give this movie 9 out of 10 - for action, suspense and generally good acting. Famke Janssen is great as the ex-wife, and Olivier Rabourdin is great as the hapless French ex-spy, desk sitter, Jean-Claude. Only criticism: Car chases and fights were too obscure. Better car chases in ""Ronin""."
"Scarecrow-88","9","1","4","30 May 2009"," Taken
","When Albanians kidnap his daughter while she is with her friend in Paris, former agent, Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson) will hunt for them, find them, and kill them. Simple as that. The film follows his pursuit of every last scumbag involved with doping up his teenage daughter, preparing her for prostitution, even discovering that members of French police are involved(..including an agent he knew while in the field). Almost everyone involved in this network of trafficking female tourists, the Albanian lowlifes who kidnap and pimp the girls(..including those responsible for selling virgins, including Kim, to a wealthier clientèle), and anyone else connected with this despicable business, Bryan eliminates. He warned them and they wouldn't listen.<br/><br/>For a PG-13 film, this is very violent, with Neeson in incredible form, and absolutely convincing, as a specialist in combative techniques, trained to quickly upend the enemy. He mentions to his daughter when she asks of his profession, and Bryan says that the title was a ""preventer"", and his mission is to secure the package which is her. He doesn't prevent the carnage that is inflicted on those who made the unfortunate mistake of taking his daughter. TAKEN is a film obviously influenced, in regards to the cold-blooded and swift actions of the hero, as many films have been as of late, by the BOURNE series because director Pierre Morel shoots the fight scenes with quick cuts and the camera often moves at a frenzied pace..Bryan's moves are so fast, it almost takes your breath away because before his adversaries can engage in combat, their bodies are dropped to the floor, a sharp thrust to the throat or abdomen knocking them for a loop. The ""race against time"" aspect reminded me of William Friedkin's THE HUNTED because Bryan is always on the move, every action devoted to rescuing his daughter(..like Tommy Lee Jones seeking after killer Benicio Del Toro hardly stopping to relax as time was of the utmost importance), no dawdling is allowed. While Morel makes an effort to show little actual flesh damage from weapons fired(..more blood spray on walls), most of the violence is of a physical nature, Bryan pulvarising foes at an alarming speed. The plot set-up might burden the more action-hungry fans, but I appreciated the decision to develop the dynamics of the father-daughter relationship and how his strained feelings with ex-wife Lenore(Famke Janssen)have undermined Bryan's intentions to make up for lost time thanks to his overwhelming job in the field protecting the country. How Bryan succeeds in his mission is really a pleasure to behold, and Neeson's effective performance really adds a great deal to TAKEN. Discovering what happens to kidnapped girls, drugged for prostitution is horrifying, and you can sympathize with why Bryan is so dedicated to wiping out this whole disgusting operation. A certified crowd-pleaser, critics re-evaluated this action thriller after it become a big hit."
"tburke85","7","1","4","30 May 2009"," Taken Better Than Expected
","I saw Taken not expecting much just another routine action movie but it was better than expected. Liam Neeson does a great job as Bryan Mills a former ""preventer"" spy who retired so he can be closer to his daughter and make up for time he lost with her. Mills quickly finds himself in a race against time to save his kidnapped daughter whose been sold into a sex slave trade in Paris. Neeson continues to show his skills as an actor especially in the action/fight sequences. With movies like Rob Roy, Schindliers List, Batman Begins, and Seraphim Falls, Neeson continues to show his talent as an actor in Taken. The rest of the cast are admirable in their roles including Maggie Grace, Leland Orser, Xander Berkely, and Famke Janssen in a brief cameo appearance. The movie does have some intense action and fist fights that are well executed as Neeson's Mills wages a one man war against the men who have taken his daughter in order to save her from a terrible fate. Director Pierre Morel did a great job of making Taken more than just your routine action movie. At the heart of the film is a story about a father's love for his daughter and how far he'd be willing to go to save her. Morel keeps that story at the center while giving audiences some cool action sequences for guilty pleasure. If you're a fan of these type of movies. Then you'll also enjoy Taken. With just enough action, suspense, thrills, and some surprises Taken is sure to please anyone looking for a good movie to watch."
"jerekra","9","1","4","25 May 2009"," ""Taken"" by Surprise.
","Prior to seeing Taken, I had no real expectations. I knew what the plot was about basically, but for the most part I thought it was a great film.<br/><br/>Liam Neesan plays a man who once worked for the government in forensics or something. His daughter goes on a trip to Europe and gets kidnapped by a group of guys that put girls on drugs and then use them as prostitutes. Neesan's character then goes off to rescue his daughter using all of his abilities that he possesses.<br/><br/>I thought the plot was simple and worked. Neesan loves his daughter and is great at forensic stuff. So him going off to rescue his daughter was interesting and exciting at the same time. Great story, one that is quite similar to that of ""Commando"" except this time it is a former forensic guy, not a former military guy.<br/><br/>Liam Neesan is great in this film. His calm and composed character fits well in this film and makes him a guy who you can cheer for. I think he was great in both ""Batman Begins"", and ""The Phantom Menace"" but I think this is easily his best performance in a film now.<br/><br/>The action is pretty good too. There are great shooting scenes as well as great hand to hand combat scenes. Some of the better action in a film that has been made in recent years.<br/><br/>I also think that the overall message and theme of the film is great. It shows what a father will do for his daughter. Most fathers can probably relate to this film and how a guy will do anything for his daughter.<br/><br/>So I really liked this film. It has great action, a great theme, great story, and a great performance by Liam Neesan. I recommend it greatly."

","This is the first movie in years where the trailer is not better then the movie. Many people would think an action movie with Liam Neeson wouldn't be good. But he was perfectly cast. This movie is the exact template for anyone wanting to write, produce or direct an action movie. It has a plot you can follow, dialog that is not over the top and a lead actor who can both act and surprise you.<br/><br/>What makes this movie good are the reasons classically trained critics hated this movie. Its plot had a beginning, middle and end. It was believable and not over the top. Critics today dismiss any movie that doesn't have more plot layers then an onion. In a movie, such as this, you don't need all that.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is Liam Neeson. He was perfectly cast in this roll. Mainly because can't picture him as an action star. He seems like the ordinary dad next door type. However, in the movie, this is whom his character is and when you see him jump in a cab to beat a guys ribs to pieces you are left with a shear ""WOW"". He is also an action star who can ACT. When he goes ape on a guy because he wants his daughter back, you believe him.<br/><br/>This movie has the triple crown."

Almost everything is believable. Although, there are some minor points where plausibility is lost. Certain aspects of the film are almost too convenient as well as rushed. That's the worst I can say here.<br/><br/>All in all, the film keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't let you down for a second. That being said, there is some room for improvement, but a pretty good film over all.<br/><br/>I don't know if I would say that it tops the Bourne films. That's a gray area for me.

First of all it was surprising to see somebody of his age (56) to be performing (carrying) such stunts so well. Then his dialog delivery which reminds of his smooth and elegant performance in Schindler's list. The 1st 20 minutes of the movie are a bit of stretch even though it sets the foundation for the movie but then every director has his own style. There again you could see the Liam Neeson from Love Actually and that's what keeps you still interested in the movie. Anybody watching the movie can make what might be in the book and how it might be written. All in all a great action movie at the start of the year..hope there are more great ones ahead and not just good ones."

And I have to say, some of you are right. All these things in the movie just sort of a happen. Rich step-father, spy father, ice-cold mother... And so on.<br/><br/>So... Why ten? Because I can even imagine what would I have done when receiving such a phone call from my daughter. So I was just watching this unstoppable daddy going through the thing like a razor. That is what I would like to do. I could definitely feel the fury of this character. I guess that is why.<br/><br/>Plus it somehow reminded me of Die Hard. Plus Liam Neeson...

","I knew this movie would be good just from the preview's.Liam does an excellent job playing as a retired CIA assassin. The film brings to light a growing problem in the world, the problem is human slavery.Apparently it happens a lot in France. The Director was definitely pointing towards Muslims from Albania as the main pushers and buyers of the slaves. I know Dubai has a history sex slavery and perhaps the director wants to say who's doing it, with out fear by releasing the movie in English and America so he wont be censored from telling the truth. This reminds me of Rambo, there was so much anger in that movie, just as in this, don't mess with people especially if you don't know what their capable of and of course the Bad guys find out they messed with the wrong guy. Excellent movie 10/10 A lot of Action but not over the top."

The bad guys are so bad you don't care they don't get any mercy from Brian (Liam Neeson). I really loved this movie. It's rare for me to see a flick that makes me want to tell everyone about it, it's rare for me to see a movie that I am not ready to leave or turn of half way in.

"Knuckle","8","1","4","8 February 2009"," Surprisingly Smart Action Film
","Liam Neeson delivers an excellent performance in this movie, giving us a cold, calculating intelligence agent and loving father without resorting to any sort of hackneyed acting tricks. The script, likewise, avoids such obvious displays of his hard edge, like kicking a puppy or something like that.<br/><br/>The main story is taken straight from the headlines, and while it may or may not be accurate in its details, it does give us something to rally behind and so we don't mind that Neeson resorts to trickery and outright brutality in his quest to find his daughter. Some might call it pandering, but since scumbag slavers do exist in real life, I don't mind being pandered to here.<br/><br/>The action sequences, while a little too quick with the editing, show a lot of thought. Neeson uses whatever is at his disposal to end the fight quickly and there are no idiotic quips or comments. He's there to do a job and talking just gets in the way.<br/><br/>Top notch effort from all involved and certainly the best movie to come out of Luc Besson in a while.<br/><br/>This movie is well worth watching on the big screen."
"honorhorror","9","1","4","7 February 2009"," This movie made me hate French, but it's made by French.
","Just wondering how the movie will affect the travelers who planned a vacation to French. If Paris is really that corrupted, I'd say thanks to the production team for warning me from traveling to Paris. LOL! Well, apart from being an excellent action thriller, Taken is a serious movie took the topic of Kidnapping-prostitution business in one of the most civilized country,Frence. The makers definitely took the position of a international prosecutor who punishes everyone in this industry. The story is about an ex-CIA agent(Liam Neeson) who was estranged from his family and got divorced years ago. Had to allow his 17-year-old daughter to travel around Europe with no guardians, he eventually found his daughter kidnapped by an international prostitution organization. Traced the steps of his daughter, he had to risk everything he had, and probably everything French people had, to save her. This is not a new kind of story. What amuses me is the undertone of the movie, which is loudly blow-ed-out self-righteousness and revenge against the corruption of a nation. Yes, that's right, a NATION. Every class and everyone is involved in the crimes committed in this movie. From the slum small-times to the ones behind the desk, from illegal immigrants to the billionaires, the movie is an outrageous accuse to the ignorant system of Paris. With such social commentary, Taken is suddenly differentiated from its homogeneous movies. Maybe that's also why it's rated 8.0/10 on IMDb.<br/><br/>My rating:9/10 Recommend to: everyone who thinks he's a good person."

","Before going to the showing of this at my local theater I looked at the reviews on IMDb. I always look at the love/hate category to get both ends of the review spectrum for films. The good reviews promised good action and a great Mr. Neeson. The bad reviews state that this film is a retread of all the other lame action movies coming out of this drab cinema period.<br/><br/>While the film is entirely predictable and formulaic in its approach, it never fails to thrill. You will never find yourself uninterested in what is going on in the film. Liam Neeson pulls off being both dangerous and gentle simultaneously. His daughter is the most annoying character, but Neeson's acting is superb enough that he makes you think he actually loves her and feels the need to rescue her.<br/><br/>This film may not wow you with its plot or character development, but it will entertain you better than any number of action films to come out recently. Think Jason Bourne except larger and more realistic."
"Kakueke","8","1","4","1 February 2009"," Dynamic Action Movie, with a Vengeance
","""Taken"" is a great movie and distinctive among modern action movies, combining more realistic heart-thumping action scenes with a straightforward story line. I find it tiresome when a film has nonstop, gratuitous action that is unrealistic, pompous, and too drawn out. I thought ""Quantum of Solace"" fell into this category, although it was not as bad as something like ""Charlie's Angels"" in terms of exaggerated effects. By contrast, I thought the action scenes in ""Taken"" worked really well, in a suspense movie that steadily lets the mystery unfold.<br/><br/>The continual suspense is presented in an easy-to-follow manner that naturally leads to the next stage. Liam Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a semiretired CIA agent whose daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) wants to go to Paris for a while, ostensibly to visit museums, but later it is revealed that she and her friend want to trail U2 on the rock group's full European tour. Mills was reluctant to let her go in the first place, in conflict with his ex-wife Lenore (that's Bond woman Famke Janssen). The characters have some personality, but Mills is a regular guy, and there is no over-dwelling on their psychology. (I could meet ""Dark Knight"" halfway on the psychology, but I thought it went too far.) Mills remains skeptical about the trip, and then finds that Kim has been kidnapped into an Albanian sex-slave ring. That's the way I like it: good guys versus bad guys. I had a similar sort of visceral satisfaction as in ""Delta Force,"" in which Chuck Norris really gives it to the terrorists.<br/><br/>The movie's intensive action is mostly in close quarters: a room, an elevator, a car, or just a regular face-to-face confrontation. Skillful filming and sharp editing give scenes an aura of believability. Besides, Mills is an agent skilled in hand-to-hand combat, helping us believe. He does mostly one-on-one nailings, but he dishes it out to a few groups of bad guys too. The fighting and shooting scenes are not padded or overblown, and the viewer is left with the sense that the filmmakers were relying more on coordination and execution of quick movements than on special effects. As for wide-open action scenes, Mills, in a fast-paced, realistic sequence, chases down a villain, who falls onto a lower highway. Wide-open action scenes in ""Quantum"" and some other movies contain too many unbelievable stunts (in ""Quantum,"" e.g., exaggerated jumps from buildings or to other buildings)."
"ferguson-6","7","1","4","1 February 2009"," Retired, Not Dead
","Greetings again from the darkness. Was actually looking forward to seeing Liam Neeson in an action movie ... especially one written by Luc Besson. Unfortunately, just didn't find this very believable, though the basis for the story is frightening and fascinating.<br/><br/>Curious as to why 25 yr old Maggie Grace was cast as 17 yr old Kim. Aren't there any actresses available who actually look that age? Did enjoy the hyper-energetic, thrill seeking character of Amanda, played by David Cassidy's daughter Katie Cassidy.<br/><br/>One of my pet peeves in action movies is when the hero can scrunch his shoulders a bit and turn his head while successfully dodging automatic gunfire. Liam would have been killed a few times, especially in the car and on the yacht.<br/><br/>I did find Liam's character interesting because of his simmering passion toward the captors and those in his way. Reminded a bit of Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. Still, for a dad digging into the underworld to rescue his daughter, I'll take Paul Schrader's 1979 ""Hardcore"" with George C Scott. While nowhere near the one-man demolition team that Neeson is, Scott really captures the disgust that a dad would feel."

The story is well told, straight forward, and they kept the action believable and not too outrageous. I have always like Liam Neeson as an actor and he was the perfect selection for this part - calm demeanor yet you can feel the rage he has inside.

","Taken - Brian is divorced but still deeply loves his daughter. Consequently he's very protective of her, and doesn't want her to go to France. Brian relents and, sure enough, the daughter is kidnapped in France and he goes in to bust some heads and rescue her. Also along for the ride is Famke Janssen as the bitchy ex-wife Lenore, and that's about as much of a character as she gets.<br/><br/>Look, there's not a whole lot in this film that has not been done before. Your taste for this is limited to how much you enjoy Liam Neeson knocking out, killing, or otherwise incapacitating 50 or 60 people. As unbelievable as that sounds...no strike it. It's just largely unbelievable. There are many things that are unbelievable in this film, such as killing so many people, in another country no less, with no repercussions. Also the various technological devices used to get Brian from points A to B to C border on magic. But the fights are so pretty and hard and fast.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson does a decent turn as Brian. I love his attempt at an American accent. I hope it replaces Arnold's voice in popularity in the 21st century. It's hard to believe his able to go from mildly over-protective humble giant to Frank Castle in the course of a plane trip, but those who have lost family members in the past are free to dispute that. His willingness to put innocents in similar predicaments does him for favors in my eyes though.<br/><br/>In the end we learn four crucial lessons from this: 1) Never go to a foreign country. 2) Foreign countries only want to sell our women for prostitution. 3) Over protective fathers are always right. and 4) A father's love for his daughter extends to using torture on others to ensure her safety. Why oh why do we have a film advertising torture days after a new president bans it's use? *sigh* I just had to laugh afterwards. All the film needed at the end was a ""This could happen to YOU!!!"" Fun, fast, simple-minded and hard-edged. Just don't go in expecting any life lessons whatsoever. B-"

All I can say is I have never been so wrong! Neeson brings an amazing character to life, that is believable and fresh. He completely outshines Daniel Craig in Quantum of Solace and grabs you almost at the very beginning.<br/><br/>While the subject matter is disturbing, it has an aura of realism that makes you connect with the characters be with Neeson the whole journey. <br/><br/>I found myself at the end satisfied - while the movie is only 93 minutes, Luc Besson has found that ""sweet spot"" when it comes to having just the right time for the storyline. Time to connect and care about the characters, yet not bored with an overly gratuitous and meaningless plot."
"RCWjr","9","1","4","30 January 2009"," Brute-tastic delight
","It has been a long time since we had a character like Bryan Mills, played surprisingly and convincingly by Liam Neeson in Taken. We have become a movie watching public which has been brain washed by the Bourne movies and to a lessor extent the dialog heavy action films of Tarantino that have come out lately. They give us 2 plus hrs of yakking, extraneous inner turmoil and brooding. Every now and then some action thrown in to keep us from falling asleep. We have been convinced that for us to feel for these men (and women), we must get inside their mind, we must see them hurt and struggle with the monster they are. It has been a long time, perhaps since the days of Segal (younger and thinner)hacking through guys like scissors through paper, that we had a an action hero who kicks ass and shows absolutely no mercy or regret and doesn't spend half the movie trying to reconcile the monster within. There is no time for such frivolity. Bryan has a job to do in Taken and all that brooding and reconciling can be done by others. Bryan only has 96hrs to get his daughter back or loose her forever. So he harnesses the power of the beast he has within him and God help anyone in his way. <br/><br/>Bryan Mills is a dad who regrets his time missed with his daughter, but doesn't sit around brooding on it. His ex-wife is now married to a guy with lots of money. She does everything she can to bust his balls. Bryan is pressured by his ex-wife into allowing their daughter to head off to Paris with a friend; this is where the real movie starts. She is kidnapped not long after her arrival and before we have a chance to blink, Bryan is in Paris, cutting a bloody path to find where his daughter is. He is told, most girls taken with the intent to sell them into slavery, are out of the country within 96hrs. There is no time in those 96hrs to worry about what might happen. He uses any and all means at his disposal to hunt down, kill, maim, torture, etc, those responsible for his daughters abduction. <br/><br/>The director Pierre Morel, who cut his teeth as the lens man on action films such as the first Transporter turns his star loose and Neeson gives a performance I didn't know he had in him. Written by Luc Beeson, the architect behind The Transporter films, has woven a very tight 93 minute film that doesn't waste time with extraneous brooding but fills every minute with adrenaline pumping action and revenge. <br/><br/>Great stuff!!"

","The fact that this movie has already been released in other parts of the world for a better part of a year now should be a major red flag.

After viewing it, I can see why it wasn't.<br/><br/>Improper character development, campy dialog, and bad acting (especially by the daughter, played by Maggie Grace - you know, Shannon from ""Lost"".) hamper the overall enjoyment of this movie. I didn't care about a single character in this film, and I think that's pretty important. Check out the daughters running skills. Every time she has to run she looks like - well, just check it out, it's ridiculous.<br/><br/>That being said, I still enjoyed the action sequences, and seeing Liam Neeson kick some ass was surreal - yet believable. Some of the more violent scenes were pretty brutal, which is refreshing to see in this current watered-down Hollywood climate.<br/><br/>All in all I was entertained by the movie.

Her acting was horrible. I mean HORRIBLE. She runs and I mean runs around the movie like a retard. I am not trying to be offensive but watch it and you will know what I am talking about. Why would the director tell an 18 year old girl to run likes she's 3 years old. Then maybe I'm wrong.....the director is retarded. What I am trying to say is that somebody is retarded in this film. THey could have done without the wife and step father. They should have picked a better actress to play Neeson's daughter in this film.

Relentless in its action and violence (especially because Neeson plays a father who would stop at nothing to get his daughter back), though be patient as it is a slow starter.<br/><br/>Yes, it isn't entirely believable, but I'm sure very realistic spy stories are really boring.

I mean, was he doing all the stunts and kicks and so on by himself (since he did some boxing in his early days) or was he taught it just on the set?<br/><br/>as for me the only little flaw is the end, where I would have expected not such a sugar sweet happy end, but rather some additional show-down or even a bitter ending, having him to die after saving her finally or something like that. because how would his life go on? he first became active after her kidnapping, because then he could be what he was always doing, so wouldn't it have been logically to let him die at the end, so to speak after he has performed his duty? but that's it already with my critique, what makes the movie still a very fine one to my mind."

","**CONTAINS NO MORE SPOILERS THAN IN A MAGAZINE REVIEW, BUT THEN AGAIN IF YOU'RE SENSITIVE, DON'T READ**<br/><br/>After listening in his cell phone, to the sound of his seventeen year old daughter being dragged away and brutally kidnapped by unknown brutes, the former Special Forces Agent Ryan (Liam Neeson) quietly waits until somebody picks up the phone. Then he says: <br/><br/>""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.""<br/><br/>A few quiet seconds pass before a voice in the other end replies: <br/><br/>""Good luck"" <br/><br/>If this sounds exciting to you, it's just the beginning. TAKEN is one of those rare gems in it's genre, a simple and wonderfully well crafted action movie where Liam Neeson plays previously mentioned ex-spy; a mediocre and somewhat pitiful man that while spending a career for his country, has been neglecting his family. Now, when the marriage is broken and the daughter already is seventeen, he bravely attempts good fatherhood, even though he barely knows who his daughter is these days, and even though the ex-wife hates him and has re-married with a rich square, who buys the daughter a horse as a sweet seventeen-gift.<br/><br/>The whole shabang gets rolling when our anti-hero is forced to agree to his daughter going for a trip overseas to Paris with her best friend - even though Daddy (through paranoia, or supernatural knowledge about the future) sense trouble. The minute she sets foot in Paris she is abducted by horrible villains connected to the trafficking industry - and our friend Liam has to give up what he's bad at, buying birthday gifts, and start doing what he does best - knock off bad guys.<br/><br/>Because, after that there's just one direction and that is full throttle, dead ahead. The revenge/rescue-action blows high in the sky - Neeson is undeniably great as a well dressed Rambo when he in one white knuckle sequence after another tracks down the big shot's bigger shot's biggest shot's even bigger shot, passing all limits of rage to stack up the bad guys in a body pile and bring back his daughter.<br/><br/>Luc Besson had a finger in the screenplay, and you can tell. For one thing, the setup is beautifully done for it's genre, that James Cameron-ish formula where you as quick as possible set up the score (which takes about fifteen minutes) and then hit the pedal to the floor. But there is a human edge to the story too, many people have had complaints about the ""boring first part"" of the movie, but it serves a point. Neeson gets time enough to make a nice and believable portrait in the beginning, and that is why we like him through the rest of the movie, and that is also why we totally agree that his every act of violence is, well, ""justified"".<br/><br/>Apart from that, there's no need to think too much in this movie - one great hold-on-to-your-adrenalin-scene follows another, it's the dark knight on a vendetta, bourne with balls, james bond not with a vodka martini but with a big damn scotch on the rocks - and when the 90 minutes suddenly have passed, you get that feeling you get when the roller-coaster ride has stopped - already over? Better get back in line, I mean jeez, we just have to do this one more time.<br/><br/>No action fan alive can miss this film. There is one line in particular that concludes the experience: "".....We can nego""BOOM"

","Liam Neeson had been a young Irish boxing champion at the age of 15.More than 40 years down the line he shows the world that he is still good enough.In 'Taken' his character is that of a former spy, who is capable of tearing apart an entire prostitution racket which kidnapped his daughter.He is relentless in his pursuit and lethal,delivering serious damage to all those who are part of the unholy nexus in this movie.Unlike most reviews I would not consider this movie as a 'Bourne'esque action thriller.Neeson's action scenes are more in line with that of Daniel Craig's Bond in Casino Royale.The difference is that Neeson is a loving father and when a man of his skills is bent on taking revenge, hell does break lose.The scenes of young girls being raped and tortured are intensely dark and horrifying and the brutal rage perpetrated by Neeson against the offenders is glorious in its fury.Neeson is indeed called 'Rambo' by one of his cronies early in the movie, more as a friendly banter,but the demolition that follows justifies this nick-name.If you love action don't miss this."

The first reason why it was an ultimately great movie is because it was the type of movie that kept you on the edge and you just could not take your eyes away from the movie theatre screen. Also, the actors that were starring in the movie did a great job of luring the people in and basically did a fantabulous job in the acting its self. Therefore, they picked out a great location for the movie I mean who does not love Paris, France it's marvelousness, but it shows that it can also be a dangerous place.<br/><br/>For example, storyline that the director Pierre Morel put together for this movie was great because it kept you wanting to know what going to happen next. Furthermore, when you have a a bunch of people like just so drawn into the movie you have done a great job. I know that when I was watching it with my parents I was like on the edge of my seat just anxious to to what is going to happen in the end it is a great action movie. Also they did great on keeping it action and not go from action to like horror movie. I find that it's a bit harder to find good action movies because people do not always do great stunts but they did great at making a really good action movie like jumping off roofs and throwing like grenades,and shooting wars.<br/><br/>Especially, the actors did great with acting you define toy got the feeling were as the were like in the actual situation and not just acting out for fun. Now a days people don't really take pride in there work to really strive do do a great job. But Bryan Mills ( Liam Nesson) did great a being not only be a dad but a great agent. Kim (Maggie Grace) who is actually born the same day as me did great at being the girl who was taken by the French gang men did great as being anxious and wanting to get out and did an abundantly high pitched scream in the movie about four or five times if I were her my throat would of hurt right away. Additionally, Lenore ( Famke Janseen) the lady who plays Brian's ex-wife and Kim's mom you could see that she really had the motherly instinct in her when ""her daughter"" was taken she really would do anything to get her back to safety. In the end all the actors in the movie did an enormously exravagant job in this movie probably there best of all time.<br/><br/>On the other hand, most parents might not approve of the film because of how there is kidnapping but its apart of the world and its function. Kidnapping is not a great thing but its what makes the movie the movie because that's were you get the action of the movie because the dad wants his daughter back and the get into a whole gun fit. The leader of the groups son gets killed and the leader wants revenge over Brian for killing his son. In other ways I can kind of see way parents don't want there hidden to see it. But they can go to the movies themselves and watch it and they will not have to worry about all the bad things that are going to happen during the beginning middle part of the movie. There is a solution to there there worries.<br/><br/>In addition, who ever picks the location for this movie did a outstanding job because who does not live Paris.Th all the old buildings and highways available they did great the buildings were old look and when you would see them jumping off the roofs it was really cool because there are many different sized buildings and they would get stuck in the close lines because many people there live in apartments and air dry there clothing. Although, it's in Paris and is an action you can still get to see a little bit of Paris it self and and what it has to offer for movies.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Why not watch ""Taken?"" If you want to watch a good action movie this the movie for you and for anyone really. In the future not all movie are going to this extravagant so people should take sometime to watch a great movie at least once in there life. All I really have to say is this movie is a good action movie for anyone who is willing to watch this movie. This movie is a good movie even for a family night out to the movies and dinner. But if you have a young child that gets scared easily don not go to watch this movie. Other than that its a good movie."
"zfiany","8","1","5","29 June 2009"," Liam Neeson is the One Star of this Movie and thanks to his dazzling performance, this movie is now on my list of Great movies!
","My list of great movies usually doesn't include action movies but more of the movies with depth and tactical plots and the likes, however, Taken is by far one of the very smart movies if one looks closely to details. Like for instance, I haven't seen any of Peter Morrel's before but there are details in the directing that shows brilliance like when Neeson is trying to barge in the apartment from which his daughter got kidnapped and while he is crossing from one window to another holding the upper edge of the out-wall, you can see clearly that the director focused on his eye wrinkles to show the effort of trying to impossibly hold on to his fingertips not to fall. Such details , only people who pay attention to the director's effort can notice them. Not to mention the shooting of some scenes were so masterfully taken like when Neeson is having the last fight with the man on the yacht and when he takes the drugged girl from the Albanians. Additionally, there is the tracing process that he does and there were details which my friends didn't notice like when he gives the paper with the phrase Good Luck but in Albanian and pretends to want to know the translation. He listens carefully to the voices of all the guys and then he picks the one he suspects he wished him good luck when kidnapped his daughter. Also, the way he notices the spotter on his daughter's mobile sim-card. And when he shoots his friend's wife in the hand ,,, all the cold blood Neeson kills with is so believable because it's his only daughter who we can see clearly from the beginning of the movie that she is his life so the story connects so well and makes all the action that I heard one of the commentators laughing at so believable and needs some kind of a certain intelligence to grasp the whole concept of the movie. And by the way, all spy movies are so stupid that they don't focus on the character of the spy and the skills he usually has as much as they focus on the stupid action like in John Woo's stupid action movies and James Bond. It's the first spy character that really can exhibit a set of skills that make you wish you were a spy. They way he reacts to how his daughter is being kidnapped while she is with him on the phone, the attention to details, the use of language, the mobile tracking while the french police tries to locate him, the driving of the car, the usage of syringe to help heal the drugged girl, torturing techniques, the negotiation with drug dealers. God I just loved this movie and I love Liam Neeson for he is really really and by far one of the greatest actors from Schindler's list to Ethan Frome (Stunning performance) to Suspect (with Cher) and many others. It really annoys me so much that some of the people dare to criticize his accent bluntly. Is this the kind of criticism where you insult the whole movie industry by ignoring the performance and shedding the light on the accent!!!!!! Such people usually don't really have any idea about movies, actors, directors, writers and they really don't understand anything but they are bitter enough to go waste their time eating popcorn and making fun of good movies to give their friends some good laughs. Thank God, they are usually few."
"Bill357","10","1","5","21 May 2009"," Superior Thriller!
","It's hard to describe how much I enjoyed this movie. It's absolutely the best film I've seen at a movie theater in quite a long time. Anyone who doesn't like this picture is probably an evil person and a supporter of white slavery!! (joke)<br/><br/>Taken is a throwback to earlier, simpler times when action movies were good and right-wing and the plot left no ambiguity as to whether the hero of the picture was right or wrong in his pursuit of extreme justice. I found myself on the edge of my seat many times.<br/><br/>The writers really know how to push the right emotional buttons, first with Neeson's horrible ex-wife, then with his warnings becoming prophetic and again with the ruthless search for his daughter. She really didn't deserve a father like this!<br/><br/>I'm glad that the filmmakers resisted the temptation to turn the girl he rescued for information into a tag-along sidekick like the one that spoiled other action movies like Commando, 8mm, and 3000 Miles To Graceland.<br/><br/>This is the first French movie that I've seen in a long time that didn't have at least one scene that pandered to Islamic and/or leftist groups! However, I'll admit that the wealthy Arabs being white slavers aspect was a bit cliché and probably offensive to middle easterners.<br/><br/>The only thing I can think of that would have made this even better was during the scene where Neeson triumphantly returned with his daughter, if he would have taken the time to tell off his ex-wife!"
"tlfarmer","10","1","5","14 May 2009"," Someone Screwed Up
","Half-way through this movie I turned to my wife and said ""Someone screwed-up."" She asked what I meant and I replied ""Someone should have tapped out Liam Neeson to play James Bond."" <br/><br/>My favorite Bond has always been Sean Connery. The way Neeson played his character in this movie I could have imagined Connery playing the same role twenty years ago. They both have that charismatic style to put their enemies at ease just long enough to get within striking distance.<br/><br/>I've always enjoyed Liam's performances. From Excalibur, Rob Roy, Star Wars and every thing else. I don't think I've ever seen him in a bad performance. Maybe a bad movie (Krull) but not a bad performance.<br/><br/>If the powers-that-be ever decide to get away from the ""Bad Boy Bond"" and back to the classic style then they need to look at this movie. The only thing missing was someone to say that he no longer had a ""License to Kill""."

"snehum143","10","1","5","16 February 2009"," A mind blowing action film that sets a high bar for 2009 action films
","This movie has it all, even a surprisingly good storyline!! Most action films are full of explosions with a weak plot. This movie is not like that at all. The script is very well written, the dialog is fantastic, and the characters are well developed. Being the great actor he is, Liam Neeson does a superb job of simultaneously depicting a loving father and a force to be reckoned with. You sympathize with Liam's character Bryan Mills in the beginning but quickly realize he needs no pity at all as he has the training and skill of 007. He loves his daughter more than anything and will hence do anything for her. I do not want to go into detail because it will truly spoil the experience for you. The trailers purposefully left out significant details for a reason... why spoil it by reading summaries or reviews? This movie went by quickly and left me begging for more. A perfect 10!"
"eclivebulldogs","10","1","5","15 February 2009"," What was the body count?
","Liam Neeson is so awesome in this movie. I've always loved him. I like most of the movies he does. But in this movie, he doesn't just kick ass and not remotely worry about taking names, he does it in such a nonchalant manner! Its just so matter of fact; the character he plays he is THAT GOOD at what he does. And Liam is JUST as good at playing this character as his character is at eliminating the opposition.<br/><br/>Like a lot of the others who've commented here, I couldn't help but compare Neeson's character to Bond and Bourne but he's in a whole league of his own, isn't he? He has no gadgets. A lot of the time, no weapons either. Just his bare hands are enough to put numerous bad guys out to pasture before they even realize they're up against a foe. <br/><br/>I'm a chick and went to see this on Valentine's Day and I couldn't have cared less that we didn't see something more romantic. I was entertained thoroughly even if a lot of the basic plot was predictable, Neeson made it all worth while!"

"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","5","8 February 2009"," Hero Focused
","In ""Taken"" from a Paris apartment frightened Kim (Maggie Grace) describes the abduction of her best pal Amanda (Katie Cassidey) by Albanian human traffickers on her cell phone to her amazingly calm dad Bryan (Liam Neeson). Bryan advises his daughter to ""focus"". Kim hides under the bed, as her Dad advises. Then Neeson prepares Kim for worst, ""You are going to be taken"" One of Kim and Amanda's abductors picks up her phone. Bryan in calm and measured voice tells him, ""I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you."" Bryan Mills has ""certain skills"" as a retired CIA operative, who was a ""preventor of bad things."" From what we know of Bryan so far, we know that Bryan will keep his word.<br/><br/>Director Pierre Morel's ""Taken"" is singular and focused like his star Neeson, who is amazingly powerful and commanding as Bryan. Neeson brings such a visceral force of will that elevates what could have been an ordinary vengeance tale. Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen's screenplay enrolls us whole heartedly in Bryan's mission to get his daughter back and punish those responsible without mercy. What works is that Bryan's actions underlie his love for his daughter. Morel, Besson, and Kamen tell a compelling and classic hero story. Bryan is man of action and honors his word. And Bryan inspires others to step up, and become heroes. There is a great story arc with diva singer Sheerah (very good Holly Valance). Early on we witness Bryan's prowess as he dispatches Sheerah's attacker at a concert. Inspired by Bryan, Sheerah becomes a hero for another.<br/><br/>""Taken"" like its hero, is defined by action. The action is driving, brutal, and unrelenting. The gun scenes are spectacular. The fight scenes are amazing with slick martial arts flair incorporating such elements as kick-boxing and Aikido. Liam Neeson is fit and strong in delivering the violence and mayhem. Neeson is a powerful and compassionate presence. He brings a determined strength, wit, and force of will that distinguishes and gives ""Taken"" its soul. All this makes ""Taken"" so surprising and so satisfying.<br/><br/>In ""Taken"" Bryan has retired from the Agency to be closer to his estranged 17 year old daughter Kim (Grace). Bryan's estranged and suffering wife Lenore (beautiful and sullen Famke Janssen), has been remarried to wealthy businessman Stuart (solid Xander Berkeley). Stuart is the stepfather, who provides everything for Kim. Bryan reluctantly agrees to let Kim travel to Paris with her friend Amanda. Bryan knows first hand that the world can be a dangerous place.<br/><br/>Albanian human traffickers abduct Kim and Amanda, and Bryan and Lenore learn from Bryan's agency expert Sam (good Leland Orser) that they have 96 hours to find Kim. The compelling narrative thread is that the people responsible don't get that Bryan intends to get his daughter and kill those responsible—that's it. At one story arc, one of the villains confesses, ""It wasn't personal."" Bryan says, ""It was all personal to me."" The hero keeps his word.<br/><br/>Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen are strong and solid. It is Liam Neeson's charismatic and unnervingly calm presence that compels and inspires ""Taken"". ""Taken"" is just a great hero story."
"Into_the_Flesh","7","1","5","8 January 2009"," Taken is like Team America. Its laugh out loud funny!
","This film looked awful from the trailer. A middle aged Neson trying to act like a believable ex CIA operative trying to track down his daughters kidnappers. It looked boring. I was wrong! The movie starts out with Neson saying some hilarious lines to his daughter. ""Don't go to Paris! I know the rest of the world. It's a dangerous place."" Its Paris after all. The french are scary and dangerous or so the film would have you believe. Sure enough the daughter goes to Paris and as soon as she gets there, two hours later she is taken by a bunch of Albanian sex trade smugglers. The fact that she gets kidnapped in the first two hours of arriving in Paris is just so ridiculous you have to laugh and there Albanian? Neson than jumps on a plane and goes to Paris to save his daughter. Neson is like a psychic or something. He can listen to a tape recording of his daughter's kidnappers voices and he knows who they are within a few moments with little trouble. This follows with more scenes that are supposed to be taken seriously by the audience just keep on coming from that point on and I just couldn't stop laughing at just how stupid this film got. The enjoyment I got from watching film was just like team America. Its showed the ignorant insular view Hollywood has of foreign countries and there inhabitants. Just as Matt Stone and Trey Parker parody the ridiculous themes of Micheal Bay films, so does Taken although unintentionally and this is what makes it even more laugh out loud funny. The action scenes and lines of dialogue are also very Team America. If you like the way Matt Stone and Trey Parker parody action movies and find most action movies make you laugh rather than feel gripped to the edge of your seat I recommend this movie."
"james.p.taylor","5","1","5","26 September 2008"," More could be done.
","When his daughter (played by Maggie Grace) goes to Europe and is kidnapped, Bryan (Liam Neeson) goes to investigate. Bryan used to work for the CIA doing dirty jobs nobody else wanted. Skilled in combat and torture techniques he uses his skills to hunt the kidnappers down.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson showed a lot of promise in his early career. The high watermark of his career so far has been 'Schindler's List' and from that point on its been a downward spiral (with the possible exception of 'Batman Begins'). Here he's badly used as a tough guy trying to help his estranged daughter. Although he does well, this isn't a role Neeson is suited for. He has too kind a spirit under character to pull off being an enthusiastic torture and killer. Maggie Grace is also awkward in the film. She's trying to play a 17year old, but doesn't do it with any skill. The rest of the supporting cast try hard with the material but also come off looking at times lost.<br/><br/>This is Pierre Morel's first shot at a big studio film. Teaming up with Luc Besson (writer/producer here) might not have been the best move. The film seems rushed in places and the emotional moments look really bad. There's also a very odd ending that doesn't seem to belong to the same movie, tacked on so the audience can go away happy.<br/><br/>All in all not a great cinema experience. If you're reading reviews in order to get an impression whether to see this film on the big screen then my advice would be to wait for the rental DVD release early next year instead"
"clanodae","1","1","6","12 July 2019"," Worst movie ever
","I don't normally watch action movies. But because the ratings for Taken were so good and the film is kind of part of the pop culture I decided to give it a try. How bad can it be? Turns out it can be very very bad.<br/><br/>The hero, Liam Neeson, is a retired spy or something like that. He has seen a lot of bad stuff in his career and knows that the earth is a dangerous place. You can get killed every minute if you don't watch out. This is proven in the beginning of the movie when he accepts the job of a bodyguard for a popular singer. Of course there is an attacker at the concert which he casually knocks out. It gives the impresson that popular people are attacked on virtually every occasion, nothing special.<br/><br/>When his daughter wants to go to Paris, he is of course not excited about it. And of course she is kidnapped as soon as she arrives in Paris. And there is no backstory to the kidnapping! Just regular East-Europeans who kidnap Tourist which they find at the airport. I mean that happens all the time, right? The 17 years old daughter is particulary dumb. She behaves like an 8 year old, always running around and screaming.<br/><br/>I find it still surprising how such dumb, brutal crap is considered a good movie. It appeals to the most primitve feelings like revenge and sadism. The main actor is simply invincible and better and stronger than anybody else. Like a superman fantasy of a little kid.<br/><br/>Sorry for the not so well written and one-sided review. I created an account at imdb just write this review because I was so angry how bad this movie was. And english is not my first language."
"leftbanker-1","1","1","6","9 April 2017"," Father Keeps Daughter from Her Dream of Being a Tramp
","Yet another entry in the ""Violence if Fun"" series. The hilarious thing about modern cinema is that you can't kill a dog in a movie but you can murder 1,000 people and viewers won't bat an eye.<br/><br/>This movie spawned a flood of even worse imitations so it's sort of like the new Die-hard. I can't believe how popular this is considering that it doesn't make much sense from start to finish. First of all, white slavery does exist but almost all of the women are from poor countries and are lured away by promises of jobs. Kidnapping a middle class America girl just wouldn't be a prudent venture for scumbags.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is a bit long in the tooth for this project, at least in my opinion. He's like 50 years old and he's constantly diving through windows or jumping off a five meter wall.<br/><br/>Then there is the matter of how he manages to shoot and kill about 50 dudes yet he seems impervious to bullets. In one scene he jumps behind a sofa for cover. That's like a little kid hiding behind a curtain with his feet showing below. The hand-to-hand fight scenes were a mix of old kung fu movies and an 11 year old child's idea of how a fight goes down (or are those two the same thing?."

This movie is pretty relevant because a friend of mine was telling me stories he's heard will on a European tour. It is a very organized crime there, even more than the drug market here in America. As for the movie, this movie was all about Liam. He reminded me of action movie heroes like Rorshack and V. The film did seem a little too perfect and things do seem to happen too conveniently. It only made me wonder what if my dad knew that stuff... Overall, this is a must for any hardcore action movie fan."

The action is very energetic and it keeps your adrenaline at its peak. The main characters in this movies are smart and very good actors and even though the father of the kidnapped daughter is old he sure can fight and move. Your heart will be pumping until the end, and you will leave the theaters with wide open eyes, your will be breathing in a heavy way and your hands tingling.

"NirvanaNaslund","6","1","6","7 February 2009"," Terrible opening, but picks up, decent overall
","Taken is a film that has been rather poorly received critically, but has been highly enjoyed by the majority of mass audiences, and it's not hard to see why. It definitely has its flaws, but keeps such a pace, at least after the opening act, that it's not challenging to watch and doesn't overstay its welcome. The movie boasts Liam Neeson; in a role dissimilar to anything I've seen him in, stars as an ex-spy and security detail agent named Bryan Mills, who goes on a committed rampage to find his kidnapped daughter.<br/><br/>The film opens with some painfully generic exposition. We have a divorced father, who now only wants to get close with his daughter, whom he neglected earlier in life because he was always away on business. His ex-wife is still bitter about the amount of time her spent away from them, and obviously desires the preference of their daughter. The daughter, Kim, of course, now has a new step-dad, who provides her with a much larger house, gets her better presents, and earns the compassion of his daughter. Kim then asks Bryan if it is all right for her to go away to Paris with her friend. Bryan is torn because, with her gone, he won't be able to form a closer relationship, however, in saying no, Kim will only be angered with him, also making relationship matters worse. There's also the fact that he has seen many monstrosities in his line of work that he's scared of what could happen to his daughter if away, alone, in Paris. Mills begrudgingly agrees to let her go. This wouldn't have been as bad, if there weren't awkward and contrived subplots spliced in.<br/><br/>When Kim departs for Paris, we are introduced to the next cardboard cutout character, her friend, Amanda, who plays the enthusiastic dumb blonde. The first thing they do upon arrival in Paris is trust an attractive Albanian fellow who they think not to question, because ""who cares, he's hot""- Amanda. Low and behold, he isn't the nicest guy, and the two of them are seized. Kim manages a quick call to Bryan, and, from there, Bryan is forced to follow a trail of clues in attempt of Kim's rescue. This opening 30 minutes is pretty much awful. It's all familiar, and not even familiarity done well. However, after the initial eye rolling, the film does pick-up.<br/><br/>Once the film reaches the search, the viewer is treated with a relentlessly paced quest. The action rarely ceases, and, thankfully, the action is exciting and remains surprisingly grounded in reality, without being dull. As far as casting goes, Liam Neeson was the perfect choice for the role. He is believable both in the sense of compassionate father and focused action hero. Apart from one scene, the scene of the kidnap, he's pretty much spot-on the whole film. The supporting acting is surprisingly serviceable as well. Despite not being delivered much character to work with, I don't really have much to complain about, they all work well with what they have. Some on the one-scene actors are particularly impressive. I find, those doesn't often deliver as much emotion as someone in their place actually would, but the emotionally honestly of even the very small roles was well done.<br/><br/>One problem with where the film goes after the introduction though is that it never really builds. The first action scene when Mills arrives in Paris is just as exciting as the climactic scene of the film. The film remains rather flat, without a real rising action. Another complaint is that I felt we didn't get inside the protagonists mind as much as we could have. For instance, at the scene of the kidnapping, we see it from Kim's point of view at the time, and then as Mills retraces it later. It would have been far more effective had we only been treated to Bryan's end of the conversation the first time, and then trace along with him. The viewer would be more involved with his character, and it would have made it less repetitive.<br/><br/>Despite the film having some flaws after the opening, in certainly wasn't as bad as I feared while watching the opening act. I enjoyed watching Neeson in frenzy as he destroyed everyone in his path with cold and determined matter-of-factness. And while I can't give this film a hearty recommendation, I'm not going to warn to steer clear either. 6/10."

I saw the film with my girlfriend and she has not stopped talking about it since. She's not into action films at all, but she appreciated the neatly derived story that is usually absent in action movies. We also agreed that Neeson played the protagonist perfectly. It helps to have an actor of his quality of course, but for it to work you need the character to be believable too... What father wouldn't travel half way around the world in search of his daughter! This movie is definitely not for critics, but for patrons who want value for money. i.e. Good story, action, and a great lead!

","Iconic. This generic action thriller is your typical run-of-the-(Bryan)mill(s) situation. Father desires to have a better relationship with his daughter, but unfortunately is kidnapped by an Albanian sex trafficking ring. Y'know, that common holiday occurrence. Well, atleast that's what people thought judging by the harsh decline in Paris tourists back when this was released! It's fine though. Grab a baguette, put on a beret and chill. Because this ""taken"" girl, who yearns to be a pop star, has the most protective daddy in the entire world. He will ""tear down the Eiffel Tower"" to find his daughter, just so she can use that karaoke machine he lovingly bought for her birthday.<br/><br/>Taken is an enigma. It has everything going against it. A cheesy first act with questionable dialogue, several moments of disbelief, the occasional clumsy editing and the hero returning back to the United State on a commercial flight (despite wiping out a third of Paris). Yet, beneath the unintentionally realistic horror of human trafficking, is one heck of an entertaining film. Morel just takes the entire scenario so seriously, that you can't help but root for Bryan Mills to smack a gun on someone's throat or interrogate an Albanian using good ol' fashioned parrilla (electrocution between you and me...).<br/><br/>It all stems from Neeson's career redefining performance. It has to. It must! The phone call outlining his ""particulate set of skills""? Iconic. Neeson embodying the likeness of a relentless one-hit KO machine? Gimme more! Shoot first ask questions later? Definitely. It's a role that Neeson needed, and I couldn't be any more thankful for his choice. He must've said ""I'll take it!"" quicker than the momentum of this film's pacing. It's unstoppable! No time to think about the implausibilities, just run, gun and fun. Ninety minutes of pure entertainment, cementing the second best fictional father in cinema history (after McClane that is...). If you haven't watched it. Go out now, buy it and enjoy the ride! ""Good luck""."

","This movie starts off with a workable plot, maybe even a good one. Certainly it had possibilities. Thereafter, it retreats to a predictable mash of violent, adrenaline rushes with cliché dialogue (one liners, come backs, etc) that any movie watcher over the last 30 years must have had their fill of. Once the plot is set, you knew generally how it would pan out. It was just a question of which country the gangsters were from, exactly who their accomplices and enablers were, and how many brutal fight, car chase and shooting scenes there would be. And also, what kind of gadgets would be used. It is all worn-out formula. 
 
Liam Neeson does okay with the material such as it is, I guess, but you almost expected him to morph into Bronson, Van Damme or even Arnold. Yes, Neeson suggests a more complex, interesting character but it is only a suggestion. Everyone else is barely there. It is entirely a Neeson vehicle. And forget about seeing any interesting directing, camera work or art direction.

","My reaction to this was similar to my reaction to Wolf Creek (2005). A very watchable film, but including some really sick sexuality. For those with their feet firmly on the ground as regards to good sexual practice then I assume this can be very acceptable horror, if one has a love of this horror genre. Taken has an even more gripping storyline to Wolf Creek, also a more blatant imagery.<br/><br/>Me, when it comes to the portrayal of sexuality I feel on stronger ground with family features such as Aquamarine, fun horror, though features at the quality level of that one are rare. Scary horror can be brilliant too, but I am safer with such as the Scream series, particularly 1 and 4, or Halloween 1 to 5.<br/><br/>I am hoping that if I watch this a few times then the problems I get from the sexual violence will calm. They did with Wolf Creek. Could be I should be able to appreciate this action story a whole lot better.<br/><br/>A plus. UK news of the problems of young people trying to cross Europe to gain political asylum hint that the sexual horror of Taken does have echoes in reality. I used to find it easy just to accept such news, but without realising the level of horror. I am now glad that I purchased my disk."

","Liam Neeson's daughter is ""Taken"" in this 2008 action thriller also starring Famke Janssen, Maggie Grace, and Katie Cassidy. Directed by Pierre Morel, the script was written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen.<br/><br/>A retired CIA agent, Bryan Mills, has moved and given up his career to be closer to his daughter Kim (Grace). His ex-wife Lenore (Janssen) has remarried, to a very wealthy man, and she seems to be limiting Bryan's access to his daughter. However, on her 17th birthday, he drops into her party and gives her a gift. He's thrilled when she calls later and says she wants to have lunch with him. However, Lenore comes along; in order for Kim to travel to Paris, she needs his permission and signature. Bryan doesn't agree right away. He's seen the seamier part of life and doesn't want her traveling alone in Paris. He finally agrees to let her go when he learns she'll be staying at the apartment of her traveling companion Amanda's cousins.<br/><br/>Of course, the cousins actually aren't there, and rather than haunt the museums, Kim and Amanda are following a rock group's tour. Kim is supposed to call him every night but that slips her mind. When she finally calls, it's just as Amanda is being kidnapped. Bryan remains calm, tells her to get under the bed, and when she is taken, and she will be, to scream out as much of a description as possible.<br/><br/>What follows is a rip-roaring, fast moving, kick ass Liam Neeson tracking down the culprits, who are engaged in the trafficking of young women. Bryan takes no prisoners, and he uses every CIA trick at his disposal, including hotwiring cars, torture, gunplay, fighting skills - you name it.<br/><br/>This is a terrific movie, and there's just enough of a setup so that we care deeply what happens. So often action films give us a shell of a story and then get right into the action - and while the action can be terrific, this is the type of film you can get into for the characters as well as the action.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson - action hero. A new genre for him in 2008; it's a genre hopefully he will explore more."

","TAKEN<br/><br/>I thought this was brilliant.<br/><br/>I always avoided watching this. I always felt the Liam Neeson was not a great actor, but this is his best role by far that I have seen. He has made some other good films, but I never expected he could pull off an action role.<br/><br/>This film is about an ex CIA agent who has retired to be near his daughter. She then goes to Paris to follow U2 and get's kidnapped. The kidnappers intend to drug her, pimp her and then sell her. Liam goes in for the rescue.<br/><br/>This film gave me so many emotions. I really got into it. Whether that be because I have 2 daughters myself or not I don't know. Firstly, I felt so sorry for him at the beginning of the film. All he wants is to spend some time with his daughter, but he doesn't seem to get the chance. At her birthday he got left behind because her new stepdad, who is rich, just outdid him with presents and party etc... Then there was Liams ex wife played by Famke Janssen. Oh my god... she made me so angry. She was such a bitch at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>Then when he went to Paris to save his daughter, I was really on edge... I didn't know if he was going to be too late. There were s many girls that they had kidnapped and sold etc that he was having a hard time. With films like these you never know if the daughter could have lived or died... she could easily have died and he would go for revenge, or she could have easily lived and he would just rescue her. It was a good, on the edge of your seat thriller.<br/><br/>The acting was really good by everyone. The story was a typical search and rescue story, but it is a very good story to tell.<br/><br/>There were a few bits in the movie which made me question things. I know he is an ex CIA agent, but where did he get all the equipment he used. There was one scene where he saves a random girl from the drug dealer/pimp guys, because she could have information about his daughter... he helped her by having a drip set up in his hotel room, needles and everything else to make her better. He made the room look like a hospital. haha. Where did he get all that stuff from?<br/><br/>I will give this film 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed it... and it changed my mind about what Liam Neeson can do.<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"
"morrison-dylan-fan","7","0","1","2 March 2013"," Taken:part 1
","Becoming a fan of Liam Neeson ever since renting a DVD of Dark Man from the now sadly closed down,local indie DVD rental shop Hollywood Video,I decided to have a look at Neeson's recent list of credits on IMDb,where I was shocked to discover that I had somehow not got round to seeing any of his new Action movies.(With the exception of his role in the Batman films.)<br/><br/>With having seen a number of exciting looking ads for Taken 2 on TV,I decided that I would start to take a look at Nesson's action films by taking a chance,on Taken.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Getting his daughter's (Kim) luggage out of the car at the airport as she gets set for an art trip to Paris with her best friend,former covert operative agent Bryan Mills discovers that his daughter has actually lied to him,and that Kim is actually planning to follow U2 on their European tour.<br/><br/>Shaken over not being told the truth,Bryan is told by his ex-wife that the reason Kim did not tell him the truth is due to how over protective he is of her.Hearing this,Mills decides not to say anything to Kim,and instead waves good bye as his daughter boards a plane to Paris.<br/><br/>The next day:Paris:<br/><br/>After having rung the phone that he had supplied her a number of times,Brayn is thrilled when Kim finally picks the phone up to let him know that she has safely reached Paris.Relived at hearing his daughter's voice,Mills happiness sadly turns out to be short lived,when a gang suddenly break into Kim's apartment and kidnap her.which leads to Bryan realising that he is going to have to dust off his covert operation skills,in order to save his daughter.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Whilst the screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen is not the most PC script ever written, (is there a single likable or helpful person in Paris?)the writer's impressively put the movies pace at 60mph right from the start,which along with giving a good sheen to the more outlandish moments in the movie, (such as Bryan going from the US to Paris in next to no time) also leads to the lightning pace helping the viewer feel the same level of breathlessness as Bryan is,as he takes on everyone standing in his way,one by one,in order to save his daughter.<br/><br/>Matching Kamen and Besson's screenplay, director Pierre Morel uses gliding scatter shots to give the action scenes a strong blistering intensity,whilst also smartly including some moments of calm among the action,which allow the audience to connect to the semi-detached relationship that Bryan has with Kim.<br/><br/>Despite accepting the movie due to thinking that the title would go straight to DVD,Liam Neeson gives the film a raw beating heart that other actors would have left empty.Along with giving the scene that he has with Kim (played by a cute and very good Maggie Grace) a warm,slightly confused gravitas,Neeson also shows that he can give the action scenes in the film a tough, gritty and surprisingly spirited side,as he shows that he will stand his place like a rock,to make sure that no one survives in their attempt to tear him and his daughter apart."

It is a well executed action thriller without many noticeable flaws. In fact, it is perhaps one of the best action film of the last 5 years, only the Bourne films were as good as this one. A film of pure energy and aggression.<br/><br/>Interestingly, this film marked the change of career for Liam Neeson, who once did serious dramas and now makes action movies, at the age of 60!

Driven by love, protectiveness, and anger, he sets out to find her...and to destroy the men who took her.<br/><br/>I really liked Taken, but the wanton, cold-blooded killings made me suck in my breath every time. Our hero is strong, angry and determined, but he is no saint, and he isn't bound by any sort of code. He kills, tortures, and even shoots an innocent person to gain leverage. For me, this is the only drawback.<br/><br/>That being said, Taken was thrilling, exciting, and edge-of-your-seat. 8 out of 10. Enjoy!"

","I give this flick a thumbs up for the non-stop action and thrills it provides, on the other hand thumbs down for an implausible plot with gunshot plot holes. Liam Neeson plays an ex-CIA agent who calls upon his skills and experiences in the good guys vs bad guys field when his beloved teenage daughter is kidnapped in Paris while on holiday by an Albanian mafia to be sold into prostitution. While his resolute courage and resourcefulness and abilities are not what is called into question, the situations he gets himself into are. Are we to believe that he could easily track down the head of the kidnapping ring based on a brief phone conversation and very vague tips from fellow ex-CIA members? And then there's the fact that he on his lonesome manages to score a round into 35 antagonists, yet he himself escapes with barely a scratch. Albanians, Frenchmen and Arabs must be such lousy shots. The there's the scene when he does get caught by the mob and hung by the wrists from the ceiling, and at the opportune moment, the bolts connecting the pipes he's shackled to give way and he instantly is free of his bonds to tackle the baddies. Perhaps Lady Luck was with him all the way through. Not to mention the incongruous ending where he brings his daughter to singing idol Sheera for voice lessons. After all that she went through, surely she would've suffered a great deal of post-traumatic stress, yet she acts as if the whole thing never happened - or maybe she went to an exceptional skillful head-shrinker. For all that, ignoring what I've just mentioned, just sit back and enjoy the action."
"tedari","9","0","1","8 October 2012"," Taken to a new level
","It has been 4 years since Taken was released, and two days ago I had the honour of understanding the hype at last. Taken, is truly a movie you don't want to take lightly. <br/><br/>If you are a stickler for logic and plot consistency, and will not allow for fantastic action scenes and adrenaline rushes make up for this; you are best to steer well clear. Taken is just that; an adrenaline thrill ride. <br/><br/>I would have to say that the threat included in this film: which is written on the title's cover, is probably the most sincere and intimidating since the Paddy Considine throw in Dead Man's Shoes 2004. I almost cried for the future victims of his onslaught when Neeson's character, speaking with an unmistakable Irish growl, assures the traffickers that he will find them. <br/><br/>Taken is a linear film and does not really take chances with twists and mind games; it just goes for the jugular, much like Neeson's character. <br/><br/>I have to say, there were some scenes that taxed the moral psyche... a scene where Bryan Mills (Neeson) shoots a man in the back as he runs down a flight of stairs. I understand that the man was armed and would have killed Mills given the chance, but it just doesn't seem proper to shoot a man in the back on any given Sunday. <br/><br/>The director, Luc Besson, really knows how to make you side with a character in a film. You really want the guy to succeed every step of the way. Even in the face of impossible odds, you know that Mills will still get out of it alive and continue the hunt for his daughter; but you don't mind: you make provisions. The action, dialogue, emotion, and change of scenery are all enough to make you want to keep watching and ensure that is daughter is safe at the end of the day. <br/><br/>One important thing to mention too is that the film is wrapped up nicely to end it on just one movie, or has the added benefit of being a potential sequel because of the lingering resentments. We know now that there is a sequel, and I can't wait to watch it."

The kid is a spoiled brat who rides horses and her biological dad feels inadequate when compared with his ex-wife's new soul mate.<br/><br/>Little Kim informs daddy that she will be traveling to Paris with her best friend, Amanda. He protests the idea, but she sweet talks him into letting her go. The twin tourists meet a stranger who shares a taxi with them. He invites them to a party and when they are abducted while Kim is on the phone with super dad, he warns the bad guys that he is a man with special skills, and that he will find them, and kill them. Anyone else delivering that line would be silly, but with Neeson, it works.<br/><br/>Through his many contacts, Mills is able to uncover the Albanian white traffickers responsible for his daughters disappearance. He reverts to his past days as a guy who gets things done in an unconventional and violent matter in order to rescue his offspring. The action sequences are good, and Neeson, a former heavyweight boxer in Ireland, steals Taken with his performance. A sequel is due in 2012, and I can't wait to see it."

","There are certainly high points in this movie in terms of excitement, and thrilling scenes. What is odd is that his daughter does not seem traumatized by every thing. The death of her friend....that has no conclusion... the girl with the jacket.....don't know what happens to her... the other two girls being brought into the sheik??? Who drives the boat? how did they get out of France? Fallout for those trading in human beings? action and the unexpected is what makes this movie work.<br/><br/>I would have enjoyed more of a team effort from his friends, especially in taking care of the other women who were enslaved. It would have been more moving, and had a bit more overall compassion."

","Ex CIA agent (Liam Neeson) travels through Paris in search of his pride and joy daughter (maggie Grace) after she is kidnapped by a group of Albanians with 'plans' for her. His long years of experience gives him a set of skills that make him unstoppable in his onslaught to find his daughter and it makes him a nightmare for the likes of people who took his daughter.<br/><br/>Overall the film was breathtaking, action packed and all together just great to watch. I enjoyed every minute of it and would more than happy to watch it over and over. The beginning was a little dry but it soon progressed to an amazing film.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film for any one who likes a good action film and enjoys watching a father fight for his life to save his daughter. To finish it off I rate this film a 9/10 because overall, it was a real thrill, however it started a little slow and it could have been longer."

","Now this movie is basically the epitome of a badass Liam Neeson. Sure Liam has played some badass characters before and will do so in the future but he is a badass in this one as well. Luc Besson is one of the writer for this movie and he is known for being part of making quasi video game style action movies. Sometimes he succeeds and sometimes he doesn't, this is one of the movie he does succeed. Now the plot isn't anything amazing, in fact it's pretty straightforward. But the action and everything is so cool without it being cheesy. Now you don't really find out the exact background of Liam's character Bryan Mills but the movie does give hints. His character is a someone that has ethics and knows exactly what to do in order to get the job done when it comes to his special set of skills. But he isn't a nice guy either and will do whatever it takes to retrieve what he lost. And that is what stands out about this character. He isn't a moralistic character that has to be the nice guy or the very good guy to with the audiences approval. The plot is this Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson) is divorced but has a daughter but she is with his wife and her new husband. The new husband is a rich guy that provides anything for his wife and daughter but Bryan still has a lot of love for her daughter. And wants to make up for lost time with her and win his daughter's affection. The wife who is played by Famke Janssen who was in the X-Men movies and GoldenEye is simply a mean gold digger. Anyways his daughter gets kidnapped and all hell breaks lose because they angered the wrong man. Overall if you want to see a simple but fun and cool action movie this one might be for you. I heard there will be a sequel to this movie and I am hoping it isn't a terrible one. And not just a cash in for the sake of a sequel but have a coherent and fun story with better action scenes.<br/><br/>7.8/10"
"DJOfRadioGallifrey","8","0","1","5 January 2012"," OMG- If you are a fan of swift justice- watch, but with caution.
","Liam Neeson packs a punch- this guy can do everything. This is an incredible film which documents the gruelling lengths a loving and 'specially skilled' father will go through to get their child back safe. It's one of those films you have to watch with caution and with a pinch of salt- the subject matter is dark, one of the darkest I have ever seen. Think of the worse crime in the world, the worse thing you could do- to me this film hit an issue that scares me to no end. You see human trafficking in the newspapers and grit your teeth with anger. This film will give you satisfaction for the violence brought onto the perpetrators.<br/><br/>The flow of the film is good,it sets the characters up quickly, shows the disrupted family unit; the spoiled but loving child, rich (thinks he's god)step-father, and bitch (happy families) mother, and of course...the protagonist; the biological father with a secret past. <br/><br/>The film was a thrill ride the rest of the way through- your suspicions as the film goes along turns to everybody, and following the protagonist 's techniques on tracking is fast, flawless and (how justice should be done)- if they're bad- kill them, if they have answers- torture them...no cushy lawyers necessary.<br/><br/>And we are given a more or less happy ending- to that particular family. But the issues brought up are still out that - pause for thought."
"dskauai_bunch","Null","0","3","3 January 2012"," Best action movie I have ever seen!
","I know, a claim of a perfect 10 movie probably sounds implausible. But Taken really is the best action movie that I've seen in my life, from about 1980 on, when I was old enough to notice things like that.<br/><br/>I could go on, but it's simple enough to say that the story, directing, casting and performances all come together to make a work of cinematic art that you can't ignore. Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace make for what sound like an unlikely pairing, but in the end jive into a perfect father-daughter set.<br/><br/>The story is great. At first one might roll there eyes at ""another dad goes for his daughter rescue movie."" Taken is anything but that. It's not a simple, ""Oh gee, person (X) is holding my daughter hostage."" No, it's a complex tale of despair and danger in what is unfortunately a real-life threat. The hostage isn't sitting in a room, she's on the move between sets of devious people supported by money, graft and corruption. It's brilliant. It's HONEST.<br/><br/>Since this is the spoiler version, I like that the writer made the characters (primarily Neeson, as the main character) react realistically to the situation. He's an ex-CIA agent, trained to kill and with decades of experience. When it comes to fighting with someone, or tracking someone, or getting information... he doesn't do anything cute, he just does it. There are no long kung fu fight scenes, or breaking elbows backwards. No knife throwing and fighting. He just kills them, boom, hand to hand, or puts a bullet in their chest. Maybe this sounds silly, but it's nice to see a super agent actually BE a super agent.<br/><br/>The final scene? The true ultimate spoiler? Ever seen a Mexican standoff where the good guy ends up dropping his weapon and then the scene develops into some stupid game of cat-and-mouse to win? Well, a Mexican standoff does happen. Or rather, the bad guy tries it. Puts a knife to Neeson's daughter's neck and hides behind her. Neeson hesitates in the standoff, his pistol raised... and then a few seconds later, after he's had time to perfectly line up his shot, puts a bullet in the guy's head, firing past his daughter. Just what you want to see from a super spy marksman.<br/><br/>Honestly, when that happened I cheered and almost jumped off the couch shouting, ""FINALLY!!!"" It was good to see the ""reality"" of a rescue/espionage film.<br/><br/>Go out and see this movie. In fact, don't even rent it. Go out and find it at the store and buy the DVD. You WILL watch it over and over."
"agreenjellybean","8","0","3","30 November 2011"," Exciting action thriller with a deeper intelligence
","I feel compelled to give this a review as it is simply majestic. First time writing a review on IMDb here, so just gonna slip in an introduction. I've always been an avid fan of intelligent films and shy away from the usual big screen summer movies that frankly, are so stupid it might just make you dumber after watching. Safe to say, I an a fan of indie films. I don't think I'm smart, or gifted in art in any way. I feel that I'm just a normal person that appreciates beautiful things so I appreciate a good music, or a good book, and most definitely a good film.<br/><br/>Taken is full of action, and is pretty straightforward. You touch his daughter, you're gonna die. Simple. But nobody says simplicity is a bad thing. Going along with the good storyline is awesome fight scenes and I can guarantee that with every punch Liam Neeson throws, your heart will jump with excitement. Is it wrong to be happy to see someone get hurt? Yes, it is wrong. But you'll get excited too nonetheless. I usually also dislike car chase scenes. Why do almost every action film has to have a car chase scene anyway? But in this film, the chase scene has a better justified purpose in my opinion, so I didn't mind.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the beginning of the film, which might be slow for some people, but it is important as every second in this film is. It gives you a better understanding in Liam's character. The thing about this movie is, it's realistic down to every final bit and everything is believable. Of course the action scenes are not ""realistic"" per se, but its as realistic an action movie is gonna get.<br/><br/>I think I really like Taken because it explores the dark side of the world, where the wicked lives. I know the events in this film do happen(not the Liam Neeson being a hero part of course), and there are more horrible things out there. Human you see, are twisted b@stards and it's nice to see the good guy winning for a change. I like the themes it explores too, like how the bad guys are bad, but they're not ""pure evil"". As f*cked up a human may seem to be, they too have feelings other than ""evil-ness"". Nothing is ""pure"" anything as nothing is perfect. I would be more specific, but I'm trying to prevent spoilers as I want people wanting to know if its any good to read my review and be compelled to watch.<br/><br/>Which this many compliments, I'm baffled as to why I gave it an 8? Never had I given a film a 9 btw. Maybe I'm just waiting a movie that is ""perfect"" in my eyes. I'm really not a good writer. I have a hard time explaining myself on a daily basis. But this should be a bigger influence for you to watch Taken, because even a simple minded person like me can appreciate it's beauty."
"Le_Bon_Sens","8","0","3","28 November 2011"," Taken is unforgettable.
","The main purpose of Pierre Morel to create ""Taken"" is to depict a story, a story which is as as true to life as breathing is to us. This story shows everyone the world which is invisible, and when it is exposed to us, it cannot be unseen! Where drugs and sex come at a high price and where the rich often superimpose their superiority at the cost of other peoples lives. I have very few bones to pick at in this movie. My main problem being that the story starts up a bit too slowly, but once Kim is taken, the 96 hours Bryan Mills has to recover his lost daughter unwind the subject of the film itself.<br/><br/>The most important statement ""Taken"" makes is it's exposing the real world in which people suffering from poverty are living in. The human trafficking and prostitution are at the base of this well elaborated subjective pyramid. While at the top is the fact that even the most honest and upstanding people (Jean-Claude) will turn their heads the other way in order to get paid. The fact that during the final scenes (Liam Neeson)appears at a white collar cocktail party, where on the Negative First floor the women are being auctioned as merchandise, blew me away.<br/><br/>The whole movie was a critique on life. The heart warming story tells of a secret life thousands of people live daily. It is known of, but not spoken of. It is a life where there are no boundaries, where money, power and greed reign supreme. This is not only happening abroad, all of these problems are encountered in every day life for some of us. This is a great movie, and depicts a never ending struggle. Although in my opinion the ending could have been a bit better."
"pareshm","9","0","2","13 November 2011"," Edge of the seat thriller
","'Taken' is Liam Neeson's one man show completely. Having said this, even if you are not a Neeson fan, this movie is still a must watch. No mystery here, it is a plain vanilla revenge story. But the way this whole film has been shot and paced, you just can't take your eyes off the screen.<br/><br/>On a serious note, it exposes the dirty world of human trafficking. The action sequences are superb, the tactics used by Leeson's character to track down the culprits look realistic and plausible (most of the times). The guy playing the role of French intelligence officer (who 'sits behind a desk') does a decent job in this one-man-show.<br/><br/>Niam Leeson is menacingly dangerous. I don't know if he has a daughter in real life; but if he has, I wonder if anyone (after watching him in Taken) would marry her, leave alone dating her! Just kidding ;-)<br/><br/>Overall, a must see film if you are a thriller fan."

","I have to say first that I cannot stand the French, and for a supposedly American character to go to Paris and beat just about every Frenchman he encounters was simply superb! Of course many elements of the story are absurd and how he goes about it make it seem too easy but gosh, I loved the action sequences and that most of the guys on the receiving end were French.<br/><br/>My disdain for the French is also why I like that Jet Li film ""Kiss of the Dragon.""<br/><br/>I've seen ""Taken"" several times on cable and relish watching it every time."

"ncolborn-1","Null","0","1","25 July 2011"," Action plus violence minus plot equals a wasted 90 minutes.
","It's hard to believe that with such ritzy credits this film could be so spectacularly awful. The story begins with the insulting premise that for teenage American girls, anywhere outside the US - even Paris - is likely to be dangerous. And it's downhill from there on.<br/><br/>Dire warnings, of what a nasty place the rest of the world is, quickly come true when the girls are kidnapped and Daddy (Liam Neeson) has to come bounding over the Atlantic in hot pursuit of the villains. <br/><br/>With the flimsiest of evidence to work on, and with the help of a conveniently cobbled together but ludicrously unconvincing back story, Neeson runs amok in Paris, leaving a trail of criminal damage, indulging in gratuitous violence and homicide - and all, of course, in a frightfully good cause.<br/><br/>The derring-do is so improbable that it tries one's patience. At one point, for example, Neeson drives a high performance car at top speed, through Paris, miraculously avoiding collision, in pursuit of a boat on the Seine travelling at about about 10mph. He'd have found it easier on a bicycle!<br/><br/>The characters of the fatuous main victims are so poorly drawn that one doesn't really care what happens to either of them - they've been deceitful anyway - and Neeson's character, as a devoted and loving father who is dedicated to violence and brutality is almost impossible to understand - or perhaps I'm just stupid."

","I'd heard about this flick for a while from various friends but I'm usually about two years behind seeing movies. Finally rented TAKEN on Zune and-- WOW.<br/><br/>Great premise, great build-up to even greater action, and filled with those set-piece character moments that just make you want to bark HELLYEAH! sitting there in your chair. Who would've known Neeson could pull off someone like this. I mean, I've always regarded him as one of the premier actors of this entire generation, but even though he's nearing (in age) the end of the generation he comes from, he sure pulled it off as someone deadly, cunning, and smart.<br/><br/>The best part was he's not a brainwashed super-weapon like Bourne, and doesn't dally around trying look good and overthink things like Bond. He's a more down-to-earth hybrid of the two, out of his peak but still very much in the game and still honed to a razor's edge in terms of his skill-sets and persona.<br/><br/>As a very discerning and picky ""action"" movie fan I was delighted. As a father of one little angel with another on the way I was enthralled. It's what every father wants to see done to scum like this on screen, where torture isn't torture, it's justice. Other shows/films try to evoke a sense of sympathy for even the most dastardly of criminals when they're being tortured. Haha, not in this film. These animals stole his baby, his princess, his angel, his world, and they pay for it--DEARLY. And it's delivered on screen with such righteousness I was actually clapping to myself when one particular scummer felt the juice from a building's electrical current go through him.<br/><br/>To end this review, Neeson's performance is nothing but balls, a walking scrotum that dishes out karate and pain and death to those who wronged his daughter. I want to give it 10 stars but settled on 8 simply because while the film is great, it's not perfect. There are quite a few implausibilities on the production's part, the PG-13 rating oozed through a little too much in that rushed, mass-audience targeting that Hollywood does so often, most notably in the hugs-n-kisses Disneyland ending with the daughter. The guy killed half of Paris getting his daughter back and nary a single cop or investigator has any interest in him. As said, I put these on the production's list of faults, not the actors or characters they portrayed. That part of it was top-notch. If you haven't seen this film, see it NOW."

","I discovered this on a DVD on a recent visit to Mexico under the title ""Busqueda Implacable"". Not being a fan of modern films generally (too many special effects), I did not realise that the film was two years old. I sat down to watch this with my wife and we both concluded that it was an excellent action movie in the James Bond style. Particularly satisfying is the way in which our hero, in his quest to find his kidnapped daughter, liquidates the baddies one by one. The action scenes are nervous and impressive. It's a more modern and more violent version of Harrison Ford's ""Frantic"". Indeed the film is very violent, but this is good clean violence and is more than necessary, given the sort of scum our hero has to deal with. There is not a dull moment in the film and that is a very strong point. I have also seen the actor Liam Neeson in various other films and have liked him every time. Some viewers may complain that parts of the film are not plausible but I would send this sort of person packing immediately - plausibility is in no way the issue here - what counts is the entertainment value and nothing else."

It is a serious issue going on in the world right now and it is not to be taken lightly. It would be different if it was made to make people aware of the growing problem but it wasn't. It was clear that it was only made for entertainment purposes.

","The Good <br/><br/>-A tensely directed film. No loose baggage or unimportant scenes. The film got on with telling the story and was nicely compact as a result.<br/><br/>-Some very good individual scenes. In particular the initial kidnap scene and the showdown between Neeson and the French secret agent. Overall a great directorial job by Pierre Morel.<br/><br/>The Bad<br/><br/>-Utterly unrealistic view of sex trafficking. Look middle class American tourists do not get kidnapped by traffickers. The film makes out that young women are being kidnapped in France daily. In fact the overwhelming majority of women who are kidnapped or coerced into the sex industry come from vulnerable backgrounds (low income - drug dependency etc) and poor areas of the world such as the ex-USSR countries, Phillipines, Thailand etc.<br/><br/>-The body count just got silly. Neeson went through a ridiculous number of disposable bad guys. I could have accepted that from a Van Damme or Segal flick but I was expecting a more intelligent movie.<br/><br/>-Spoonfed investigation. Other than the clever bit Neeson does with his daughter during the kidnap he pretty much moves from one strand of investigation to the next with little real difficulty thanks to outrageous coincidences. For example luckily the first pimp he meets in Paris is directly involved with the kidnappers. Who then immediately drives off to go the brothel site where luckily his daughters's jacket is there etc. The coincidences just went on and on.<br/><br/>-Cardboard cutout villains. And I don't just mean the sex traffickers. It was obvious from the get go that the mom and step father were going to be made out to be practically criminally negligent. Neeson told them it was dangerous. And of course he is proved right less than 4 hours after the girls get off the plane! Way too obvious villains for the audience to boo at. Yawn.<br/><br/>Overall I'll still give it 6/10 as it was an exciting film. It was just disappointing that what might have been an intelligent thriller turned into a generic action flick with the cheesiest ending of all time.<br/><br/>And as for realism well if you want a serious look at the realities and evils of sex trafficking watch Lilja-4 ever.<br/><br/>PS. To all Americans thinking of coming to Europe please do not be put put off by this film. It really is very safe!"

Basically if Daniel Craig were in this film it would have been a James Bond, with a few tweaks to the story. But off 007, this movie is about an ex-CIA agent that is divorced and his daughter is captured by some guys that want to put her into a prostitution ring. Then when the daughter is captured, Neeson goes after the bastards who want to sell his daughter's body. All the while the mother and rich guy are doing nothing. Basically its just a great action/spy movie. Hopefully we h-wood will keep giving us these awesome films. As a huge fan of action I think that 2008 was the best year of the decade for movies."

","Back then when the movie was out, I saw it as just another movie about saving kidnapped loved ones. When I finally get to watch this, it turns out that I was wrong.<br/><br/>The movie was simple and straightforward. It was about this guy who used to be a field operative for the CIA. He retired because he wanted to spend time with his daughter and such. Later in the story, his daughter was kidnapped by someone and this is when he vows to save his daughter and kill whoever that did this. (I pray to God IMDb doesn't consider this spoiler.)<br/><br/>The story turned out the way I thought it would. Most events unfolded the way I expected it to. It was lacking twists as well. So generally speaking, it's very very predictable. However, there is this one thing that clearly distinguishes it as a unique piece from the others.<br/><br/>This one piece being character definition. The writer did a fantastic job in defining the characters early in the movie. You understand why each character had this thought or did this etc. And the best thing about this is that the writers managed to define the characters through detailed, and yet usual, daily actions (eg. buying a gift for daughter's birthday), so it doesn't fell crammed in at all. It felt natural as they show us the sides of the characters.<br/><br/>On top of that, the actors were simply great in this one. Liam Neeson is awesome as usual. Maggie Grace is surprisingly good, and is definitely worth looking out for. The others did a good job as well.<br/><br/>Notice my comment on the movie being ""textbook""? Yes, it's as generic as it gets, but the way they managed to present it makes the whole experience a fresh and engaging one. And it being ""textbook"" is also a compliment, because while they didn't put in some fancy new ideas, they did pull out everything that is required to make a good action flick, and gave those elements some nice waxing and polishing.<br/><br/>To conclude, it's a must watch for everyone."

","way too many story holes, from the beginning, the super-rich stepfather could never risk allowing the girl(s) to travel unprotected overseas. What about the French/Paris police and how could he possibly evade arrest(especially during airport hi-jinks w/ the taxi)? Also Bryan ducked and dodged a little too much automatic weapon fire, from the construction site scene forward. However, the film was very well-made and left me with a good feel--I'd recommend it to most folks. BTW--if there's such a market for high-priced sex-slave traffic/trade young girls, wouldn't it be easier for an enterprising group of Albanians to start up a little country genetic ""body farm""?"

","It's okay. It's a VERY '80's-ish action movie, straight outta the ouevre of Segal and Chuck Norris. They cut this one right down to the minimums-characters are presented, spoiled daughter goes w/ airheaded pal to Paris, gets kidnapped by white slavers from Albania, CIA-spook dad Liam Neeson comes after them, does his best Dirty Harry/Paul Kersey on the string of baddies, which leads to a final shoot-out/battle onboard some arabian sheik's yacht in the Seine(!?).

"jtindahouse","9","0","1","30 October 2009"," Where the Bond series would love to be
","Taken is a truly refreshing and rewarding experience to view. It's back to the basics. A ruthless, believable (to an extent at least) hero kicking bad guy ass. No gadgets, no one liners, just doing what needs to be done in fine style. Seeing a man fight to get his daughter back is so much more rewarding than watching someone try to save the world, or something to that effect, because a) it's believable and b) because we can relate to it, perhaps not directly, but certainly to a larger extent than the world being in danger.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is in outstanding form carrying the movie from start to finish. His slick tone, mixed with well performed stunts, result in the creation of a simply magnificent character. I have no doubt Daniel Craig will be watching this performance a few times through before beginning work on the next Bond flick.<br/><br/>The movie is of course not without flaws. It would of been nice to see one of the villains challenge Neeson's character fractionally more rather than just standing there like a lifeless dummy while Neeson did as he pleased with them. Also the escape when he gets caught seemed far too straight forward and basic to be in the least bit satisfying. There must have been a more stylish way to handle the escape than simply having him pull the pipe from the ceiling.<br/><br/>Nevertheless Taken certainly has a lot more things going for it than against it and this is why it is proving to be such a popular film. I'm disappointed it took me this long to see it and I'll say if you haven't caught it yet and are perhaps on the fence as to whether to watch it, have no second thoughts about seeing it. You won't be let down. And let us just hope no sequel is ever made. This is without doubt a film that will be best left as is with nothing added to it."

","This film is about a former spy who uses his skills to save his kidnapped daughter from a human trafficking gang.<br/><br/>""Taken"" has received very good word of mouth, and I can clearly see why. From beginning to finish, it's full of action or thrill. Human trafficking is a tough issue to watch. By having a determined father to rescue his daughter, it gives hope to the viewers that there might be a chance for a happy ending. Therefore, the story is exceptionally engaging throughout. I am normally a pacifist, but I find myself wanting Liam Neeson to win every fight and shoot every bad guy right in the head. <br/><br/>It is refreshing to see an action movie with a purpose, as opposed to senseless violence. ""Taken"" is a cinematic experience that has to be experienced."

","Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a man, who tries to reconnect with his daughter after spending most of her youth somewhere else than home. He's a bit overprotective, as he claims he's seen the world as it is and he gets more nervous, when he learns, that his daughter is leaving in France together with another young girl. And then his worst nightmares come true, when his daughter is kidnapped. But the reason, why Bryan was so much else where than home is, that he is a former, top notch agent, who won't stop until he gets his daughter back.<br/><br/>At a first glance, you can say, that Taken is a cliché.

","In case you are a movie buff: when you watch any movie, within the first 10-15 minutes you will most likely get a feeling about the level of satisfaction it is going to provide you thereafter. After watching this movie I thought of it as an adrenalin-fueled revenge flick from French Director Pierre Morel which is even better than all James Bond and Bourne film series put together in terms of pure entertainment value. <br/><br/>TAKEN could easily have become a cliché film like so many we have seen before. However, Liam Neeson plays his character of 'an ex-CIA agent who is determined to find his daughter at all costs' with such finesse and elegance that you will find an unbelievable freshness in the way the movie unfolds and in its execution. After watching him play the role of Oscar Schindler in SCHINDLER'S LIST, it's simply incredible to imagine him playing the role of a retired CIA-agent and that too with perfection. I still have Goosebumps when I see the part in which he talks with the kidnapper and says: ""I don't know who you are, but if you don't let my daughter go, I will find you and then I will kill you..GOODLUCK""- I just LOVE it.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend TAKEN to everyone even if you have little interest in action-thrillers or Neeson. So fasten your seat belts and get ready for the fastest 93 minutes ride of your life. You are going to enjoy every second of it. 9/10 without any doubt!"
"webmaster-3017","8","0","1","16 June 2009"," HK Neo Reviews: Taken
","Tagline: An efficient Hollywood revenge formula that works <br/><br/>Review by Neo: Liam Neeson is easily one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. In a quick flash back, he was memorable as the stoic yet philosophical in the Star Wars Prequels and equally mysteriously cunning in Batman Begins. Apart from his nominated work by the Academy in Schindler's List, Liam has hardly been recognised by his industry. In Taken, Liam manages to engage the audience despite the simple and typical plot line by French inspiration Luc Besson of a tale of revenge and rescue in the city of gloom and doom Paris. Paris is an interesting setting and despite being stereotyped by Luc Besson's zillions of other films, it remains a juxtaposition of a city. Without a trace, Paris is definitely romantic, beautiful, but at the same time, one would easily instil a world of drugs, prostitution and anything that is ugly about the world today. At the end of the day, it is safe to say that a tale of a father chasing after the kidnappers is cliché yet thrilling, unoriginal, yet interesting and extremely efficient thriller to say the least.<br/><br/>The story goes like this: Liam Neeson plays a former CIA agent and one day his daughter (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped while on holiday in Paris. The only trace of evidence is a phone call from his daughter, just the moment before she is taken. So the tale of a father turning the world upside down to find his daughter begins and the journey is certainly worth following, even if the believability of the chase is very much within questionable minds.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, Liam Neeson plays the role of a father, extremely well; his ability to handle the most unbelievable situations during the process of the chase is that of an experienced actor in the works. What made his performance more believable than it should be is that he is ultimately a father at its very core. Imagining myself as a father, where my daughter is taken away, I would do everything in my ability to protect her and even go and save her. As a result, with that mindset, it is easy to believe the actions of a tormented soul. It is rare that Liam is given a juicy role to work with, and here, he showed all the emotional torment in the most respectable manner and while by no means Oscar worthy, it is a display that made the film better than it should be.<br/><br/>Actress Famke Janssen (X-Men: The Last Stand) plays her role competently without being memorable, but then again it may well be due to the limits of the script and the fact that Luc Besson is not looking for a femme fatal in this tale. Still, she is believable enough, without hampering the efficiency of the film. Likewise, Maggie Grace (Jane Austen Book Club) is given little to work with apart from screaming and looking extremely distressed in the emotional torture of being kidnapped in Paris. Perhaps the only part of the film that fails immensely is the lack of chemistry between the father and the daughter. This may have been done purposely or indirectly, as the father is meant to be distant to the daughter, due to his former devotion into his work for the CIA, rather than looking after his family.<br/><br/>There are some memorable scenes, like the electrifying room where, Liam is questioning the suspect, the scene and the moment when the daughter is suddenly taken from under the bed (the only problem here is that this scene appeared in the trailer, don't you just hate it!) and a typical Luc Besson's car chasing sequence. Like all Besson's films, the action is well shot, well timed and integral part of the film. There is no doubt that director; Pierre Morel has a great eye for action and the city of Paris. As a former cinematographer in many other Luc Besson's productions like Jet Li's Unleashed and Straham's Transporter, Morel is able to portray the ugly side of Paris and it works in the films favour in terms of the film's direction.<br/><br/>All in all, Taken is an extremely efficient display of a chase, a thrill, a ride and ultimately at its core, a tale of a father who will do anything and everything to get his daughter back. Despite, the similarities to the 24 (TV Series), Taken actually works and that's good enough for me and probably most genre fans. It is true that the film relied immensely on the good acting from Liam Neeson, but director Pierre Motel should be complimented for creating such a tight and thrilling encounter for the audience to endure. A fine display of merging the boundaries of French and Hollywood film-making and as the French saying goes, Luc Besson, you did it again  (Neo 2009) <br/><br/>I rate it 8/10<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thehkneo.com</li></ul>"

","First off, I'd like to say that I'm not usually a fan of action movies like the Borne movies, 007 or Mission Impossible films. They're always too over the top for me... So far removed from reality that, at times, i find myself laughing out loud at them.<br/><br/>Then there's this movie... everything about it feels real. The characters, the plot and the surroundings.<br/><br/>This movie has a very basic and relatable theme... daughter gets kidnapped, Dad wants daughter back at any cost.<br/><br/>The best part, in my opinion, is the use of Liam Neeson as the action star of the movie.<br/><br/>He's not some Brainwashed super spy, or some agent working for some super powered orginization. He's just an ex-spy out to find his daughter.<br/><br/>I would say this movie is better than the most recent Bond film, the last Borne film AND the last MI film.<br/><br/>And I really hope to see Liam Neeson used more in these roles, his deep voice and calm demenor make him perfect for these roles."
"TdSmth5","9","0","2","26 May 2009"," Spartan meets French action movie
","This movie surprised me quite a bit. The ads made it look more like a twisted thriller, while comments I heard made it sound like a cerebral movie. It turns out it's a rather an above-average action movie with a storyline that borrows heavily from the excellent movie Spartan.<br/><br/>The first 27 minutes or so are rather dull and annoying. Neeson plays a meticulous retired agent who spends his time trying to connect with his daughter who lives with his ex-wife's new rich husband. And his daughter is one annoying girl. His buddies try to hire him to do high-paying security jobs. He eventually agrees. At that point the action starts, when the singer he's guarding is suddenly attacked by a guy with a knife.<br/><br/>His daughter then decides to go to Paris with her even-more-annoying bimbo friend. In Paris they are kidnapped, forcing Neeson to travel to Paris and take matters into his own hands. He's got contacts there with law enforcement, but they are not willing to help. He finds, rather easily, everyone involved with her kidnapping and the motive behind it all: to sell her as a sex slave.<br/><br/>The action is pretty good and quite brutal for a PG-13 movie. But it's the French sort of brutality, think The Transporter, so it's somewhat comical but here at least people are killed- a lot of people. It's not as campy as most French action thrillers of late, in that regard it maintains some of the soberness of Spartan. But there is still an element of fun here. French export action pics certainly are not known for realism and this one is no exception. All that Neeson needs is a word and he can figure out where, when, and who. He can kill anything with a single shot, while his enemies armed with machine guns can't even hit his car.<br/><br/>Overall this is a very entertaining and exciting action pic. I'm not convinced by the casting. Neeson can act the part but he sounds more like a grandfather than a father and sure looks fragile. The insufferable Leland Orser plays one of Neeson's action pals. While poor Xander Berkeley gets a thankless role as the rich dad. Spartan is still the superior movie, but this one makes for a fun and lighter companion."
"kinjal-nandy","8","0","2","16 May 2009"," The best way to experience 93 minutes of your life....
","If there is any single word to describe this whole film it would be 'Focus'. It could be argued that passion, sentiment, pace are important aspects of this movie but these qualities that merely augment the central theme of the single-minded purpose of a father whose world revolves around the security and happiness and love for his daughter. A famous young poet once commented, 'Love for your children is unidirectional, it has this unnecessary tendency to be suspicious'. While movies like Mrs Doubtfire, Father of the Bride and Meet the parents were more instrumental in depicting this truth, Taken wouldn't be too far either.<br/><br/>As I have previously said, this entire film is about the focus of a person who could virtually do anything in his power to rescue his daughter from the miseries of woman trafficking. But the trigger behind this focus is the factor of love, for which he could travel 30,000 miles to attend his daughter's birthday while he was on a job, decides to retire in order to stay close to her and lastly goes to Paris to rescue her when all others had given up every possible hope. An important attribute of a good actor is to immerse himself/herself completely in the character he/she is playing such that while watching a movie the audience is not conscious of the fact that it is an actor that is playing a role of a character, rather it is the existence of the character all by itself. Liam Neeson, undoubtedly falls in such a category and once again he has proved his versatility, power of expression and dynamic image through the portrayal of the character he has played. People, who have Schendler's List or Love Actually or Michael Collins in their memory while watching this movie, get prepared for a completely different dimension of dynamism from Neeson. Facial expression changes, one of his arsenals has been depicted in a number of situations, right in the beginning of the movie when after presenting his daughter with a karaoke player, she runs to ride on the horse his step father had bought her as a present, there was a sort of painful resignation in his expressions which seems to say a million things but express only one, 'I have nothing more to offer except my love'. Similarly while he hears his daughters shrieks and cries over the phone while she is being taken away and just before he utters the famous dialogue of this movie, his expression suggested a sort of unbearable helplessness, as if something was happening and he just couldn't do anything to prevent it. The other characters of this movie, played their role accordingly but there was really nothing much to offer from the perspective of their roles. <br/><br/>The film had good pace, a sort of continuity you would expect from such action movies like 'The Dark Knight' or the Bourne series movies. It is important that such movies maintain their pace most of the time and pause at critical moments only to give some time to the audience to assimilate the successive events they had seen. Background score normally plays a very important role and acts as a catalyst to the motion of the movie and in this case it did just as was expected. The action was quite realistic, especially the hand to hand combat and it was pretty obvious that Neeson had taken a good training at this fighting art, known as Shinshai Goshin kai, an art taught to the SAS members and that it avoided the special effects commonly seen today mostly in martial arts based movies. However, at times the events seemed quite unrealistic especially the fact that a single person can wreck havoc in a country like France for whatever wrongs he has faced and still come back safely leaving the entire security system in tatters. But in such movies, one needs to overlook such subtleties and concentrate on the holistic effects of the events. There was no effort to explain the process of girls trafficking and the prostitution business that is prospering in the French-Albanian border regions, but that was merely presented to add to the sensation or increase the criticality of the girl's abduction. There were no surprises, the film was predictable, but one would still be anxious to experience the excitement of the climax and that is what the effect of the pace of a movie can do. <br/><br/>It is a movie which is worth the ticket price, and one would never realize how one and half hour has passed. In a nutshell a compact, well- paced, well directed movie and not to forget experience the versatility and dynamism of a legendary actor who has won the heart of millions by his unforgettable performances in the past."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","0","3","1 May 2009"," A pleasant surprise.
","Not much was to be expected from this movie and it wasn't very widely advertised at the time of its release. I also hadn't heard much about this movie before watching this movie, neither from the common crowd or the media. Besides, it stars Liam Neeson in an action-role, how good can that ever turn out to be? ""Taken"" is however unexpectedly good and one of the more pleasantly surprising movies of 2008.<br/><br/>Within its genre this is simply one fine movie. It's a quite tough and bold action movie, in which we see lots of graphic killings. It's real pleasing though to see the main hero shooting and fighting his way through France, leaving a real killing-spree behind him. We can feel for the character and therefore are also more into the action. We understand his motivations and we even cheer for him when he bluntly kills another person point-blank or shoots someone in the back. A real accomplishment for an action movie to get its crowd so drawn into the movie its action.<br/><br/>It's pretty obvious though that this movie got heavily influenced by the also unexpected bug success of the Tony Scott movie ""Man on Fire"". It uses a similar type of plot as well as main character and it also handles its action in the same kind of way; Very bold, raw and straight-forward. The movie is not as fresh or well constructed as ""Man on Fire"" though but the movie also deserves better than to be merely called a ""Man of Fire""-wannabe.<br/><br/>I must say that action movies really seem to get tougher these days, in terms of its violence and mainly the handling of it. Movies now days often pick a more realistic approach instead of going over-the-top with any of its action. Because of this the action actually looks and feels more tough. It's a real welcome development within its genre.<br/><br/>It's not in the least thanks to Liam Neeson that this movie also works out really. Of course it seems like an odd for a 55-year old Liam Neeson to go Jason Bourne-style but it works out surprisingly well for the movie. He handles his role and also its action really well. His character makes the movie and its story work.<br/><br/>Not that the story is much special though. It's suiting and good enough for within its genre but it's just not all quite good and fresh enough to truly consider this a brilliant- or the most original recent action movie around. I therefore was also real surprised to see its rating on here, which is extremely high for a movie of this type and its given the movie a bit too much credit. Like I said, it's a real unexpected great movie and I really enjoyed it from basically start till finish but really an 8 people? Just really too much, especially when considering that there are far too many great movies out there who have a far lower average rating on here. Oh well, the average voting score will probably settle down in a couple of years from now, giving the movie its place and rating it in all sincerity and objectivity deserves.<br/><br/>But to end completely positively; ""Taken"" is a real unexpectedly great movie within its genre, in which Neeson perhaps surprises the most as a convincing action-hero.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Pierre Morel's Taken is only the second film he has directed, but it is very solid work. It is obvious that he takes pains in using his experience in operating the cameras to make sure the visuals are very well done. This movie is short, but to me the length is an advantage.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, there is a fair amount of time in the beginning of the film taken (no pun intended) to develop the story and the characters. We find out quickly & efficiently that daddy is divorced and his daughter is turning 17. Daddy is trying to bond more with his daughter but mommy seems to be throwing up road blocks & isn't very good at communicating with daddy. <br/><br/>Daddy is then shown doing his job which is person protection of a female rock singer. This shows a little of what daddy does for a living and introduces some plotting to the picture. Then daughter springs a big lie on Daddy about going to Paris in the summer & lies to mom too about where she is going to be because the daughter has been lied too by her girl friend too. <br/><br/>Now the blonde girlfriend (Amanda) doesn't get developed too well except her main interest for the summer seems to be going to Paris and getting laid all summer. When the daughter gets to Paris she becomes apprehensive of what Amanda has gotten her into, especially when she finds out they have a Paris Apartment to themselves for the summer. Amanda does get laid, but not the way she intended too.<br/><br/>Both girls are taken by Algerian terrorists who drug them to make them sex slaves. Luckily the daughter calls daddy who tries to reason with the terrorist but is told ""Good Luck"" by Marko. From this point on, the film is almost non-stop action but action which moves the story along.<br/><br/>The best thing besides being direct about this film is the action sequences are done well. The story pulls the viewer in and we feel great satisfaction when all the bad guys keep getting taken out, one after another. Very good film, not sure when DVD comes out if it might have some extra scenes. It might but the form being shown in the theater now is pure satisfaction."
"ram_dhanush","9","0","2","25 February 2009"," Not just another action flick
","The last time I sat through an action movie and was completely impressed by it was back in 2006 when I watched 'Casino Royale', a James Bond flick which topped all its predecessors in terms of substance and intelligence and very strong emotional undercurrent wheeling the story instead of just plain height-jumping stunts. 'Taken' follows suit with 'Casino Royale' in that respect.<br/><br/>The utmost impressive fact about 'Taken' is its non-nonsense approach. Its pretty admirable that the director convincingly manages to establish the emotional undercurrent of the movie within such a short period that makes you really feel Liam Neeson's hunger and desire to find his kidnapped daughter. And the movie is only 90 minutes long. It ends before you know its ending. That's how pacy the screenplay of this flick is.<br/><br/>Sure, this is no masterpiece, but you can't expect much more from an action flick. Its an action movie, and it serves its purpose well, and not to forget the film also exposes sex slave trading activities (which still exists) in parts of the world. Some of the scenes depict the brutality of the business so convincingly, and unlike your typical action film, the avoids many common clichés- a silent, unspectacular start which gave more space to show you what a father-daughter relationship is like, and the stunts are not actually as much over-the-top as other action films tend to be.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson's performance is simply talismanic. You can simply feel the hunger and desire for revenge that beams in him, and the way he goes about with an uncompromising approach towards finding his daughter is another high point. Famke Janssen (of X-Men fame) and the rest of the cast are adequate, but its Neeson's show all the way- it simply goes down as one of his career-best performances to date. (right there with Michael Collins, Love Actually and Henri Ducard of Batman Begins). He owns this film. And its also his first action film in a long, long time and he seems fresh and fit to jump around ships like a 16-year-old again.<br/><br/>The film also has one of the best action monologues I've seen or heard in a long time, Neeson's 'I will find you, I will kill you' is damning, downright chilling statement of a dialogue that sets the tone for the rest of the film. Not to forget how he mentions it again when he meets Marko in person.

","I have to start off saying that I really enjoyed this movie. I've enjoyed Liam Neeson since first seeing him in Suspect with Cher and Dennis Quaid (and he didn't even have any lines). It was amazing to watch the physical transition on his face from worried father to brutal hunter.<br/><br/>Brutal is truly the best word to describe this film. It was something else to see Neeson pull off these fight sequences. Amazingly well done.<br/><br/>There were a few things that both my husband and I agreed that they should have fixed: <br/><br/>1. Where were his buddies? They made a point of introducing these three teammates early on in the film. They were the first people he turned to while still in the States. So, why weren't they there to assist during the hunt? I think that would have been an excellent addition to the action in the film.<br/><br/>2. There was no need to shoot the wife. We didn't like that scene in the slightest. I think the ""convincing"" could have been better done with well written dialogue instead. Just enough underlying innuendo for the officer to realize the danger he was in.<br/><br/>3. At the end when father and daughter are returning home, they could have easily shifted the focus to a television broadcast as mom and daughter hug or as mom hugs ex-hubby and sees the broadcast over his shoulder, something. Anyway, have a news broadcast talking of the amazing rescue and return of x-number of young women after a massive, coordinated effort to break up the female slavery trade in Europe. Then fade back to the family reunion.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Hollywood just call us before they miss these details? ;-)"

","I give this movie a straight 9/10. All I can say is, you need to go and watch it if you haven't already. It's not just some action movie, its got a solid storyline depicting something which is happening for real in today's world. It's sad how so many innocent young women get trafficked each year. It is simply a must see. Although its a PG 13 movie, some scenes may not be suitable for 13 year olds. But it's a movie every parent should watch and be alert with their children. And for others to be aware. The acting is pretty good, although the teenagers did seem to be a little too overexcited (not sure if that's typical of every teen). But the movie is on the move 10 minutes into it. You won't get bored at all!"

","Absolutely terrifying. I was screaming and crying during the whole kidnapping scene, and I couldn't sleep the night after I watched it. Very scary, but also very good. I'd totally watch it again if I wasn't so afraid.<br/><br/>Problem: WAY too many innocent people are shot or killed. Brian was very, very violent the whole movie and it doesn't really give kids the right idea. It's only PG13 because there weren't any f-words...I loved it, but I do NOT recommend this to anyone who gets scared easily. When Brian and Kim were reunited though, that was just so great. I was crying then too, but for a different reason. <br/><br/>If you can handle a lot of violence, death, and torture, you'll love it. If not, don't watch it.<br/><br/>Final Problem: Brian was too invincible. He would go into a room of like 5 kidnappers and kill them all easily, even though they had the advantage. A little unrealistic. He was only beaten once, and that lasted about two minutes before he went back to killing everyone."

","I'd have to describe Liam Neeson's acting as a worthy combination of James Bond and Rambo. He plays his part so well, fitting into the ex-CIA operative wonderfully -- totally believable. He shows the audience that this Bryan Mills guy is one you don't ever want to #&@$ with! It makes you wonder why he wasn't selected to be one of the serial Bond actors. He'd have done a great job. If you're looking for action this is the place to go. Plenty of flash and dash with a token amount of skin thrown in. Cars, boats, luxury, guns...you know the drill. As to negativity...his ex wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) is so-so, not particularly into her role. Another problem I have is with all the micro-cinema shots that accentuate the action while not allowing you to see the whole picture. This type of shooting gets boring quickly. Oh, at the end there is the ultimate bad guy, a 'sheik' of course. This portrayal has really run its course in media tales. In summary, the movie has a decent plot but the real draw is the talent of Liam Neeson. For that reason alone you should get to see ""Taken."""

","In general I tend to prefer foreign films, fantasy and romantic comedy. I was intrigued by the premise of Taken, and a friend convinced me to watch it. I generally avoid movies that are stressful because I watch movies to escape and relax, but I don't regret my decision to watch Taken. The beginning of the movie absolutely terrified me and I was literally shaking in suspense. Taken has LOTS of great action and fight scenes, that with a few exceptions are pretty much believable. The movie is very involving and many times I found myself cheering out loud when a bad guy got taken down. With the exception of one scene, the violence in the movie isn't terribly gory or disturbing, but if you're a parent concerned about exposing your children to violence, then this is not a good choice. This is a good date flick as there's a lot of tension and cliff hanger scenes. Liam Neeson steals the show as he is on screen the ENTIRE move. If you love Mr. Neeson, you'll enjoy this movie.

","Stupidity never stopped Rambo from being entertaining, even in the latest installment when Stallone's a wrinkled old man. In Taken we have the hilarious premise that old fart Liam Neeson can karate chop his way through an international sex slave ring without getting so much as a bruise. Guess what, it works. They did a good job of finding a stunt double that looks like Neeson because the action flows flawlessly and there are some really good John Woo moments here. There aren't many surprises, no plot twists, just a father shooting, stabbing, blowing things up and generally kicking ass in search of his kidnapped daughter who is on her way to Hostel Part 3, ala Mel Gibson in Payback. The fun is in how they don't hold back. It's a total riot to see Shindler mercilessly killing anyone who gets in his way with the emotion of the Terminator in a quest toward the completely improbable goal of finding one teenage girl in the midst of all of Europe. It's simply satisfying to see the bad guys get what they have coming. Granted, this is a really dumb movie, but even a dumb movie deserves an eight when it achieves in the goal of entertaining."

","I really enjoyed this movie! It's as if Jason Bourne got married, had a daughter, and had to rescue her when he's middle-aged. I'm a father of an 18-yr-old daughter, so I can relate a little bit about wanting to protect a daughter and rescue her if necessary. All of the acting was excellent, and I thought the plot was believable, even if the odds of everything happening as shown, and the end result being what it was, was very slim (some would say not believable, but it's a movie, come on!). What was particularly refreshing is that the language was closer to what I believe to be how most civilized people talk, rather than the F-word fests of most movies these days. Sure, a few profanities here and there, but when people are getting shot and such, that's probably expected. One result of anyone seeing this movie; they aren't going to be letting their teenage daughter go on any foreign (non U.S.) vacation!"

"Jerique","8","0","2","2 February 2009"," Liam Neeson in the role of his career!
","This film starts off to show that generic relationship between an ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and a loving father (Liam Neeson) who are unable to co-exist but share an interest -- their daughter. Bryan (Neeson) quits his career as a ""preventer"" to be closer to his somewhat distant daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). Kim plans to travel to Paris with her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy, who you'll recognize from ""Click"") but needs permission from her father in order to go. When Kim is 'Taken' by an group of Albanians, Bryan goes on a mission to kill everyone involved in order to get back his daughter.<br/><br/>I was literally on the edge of my seat from the moment of Kim being taken (which is what is shown in the trailers/spots) until the very last frame. The movie is action packed, and while it endorses a massively high body count, the kill scenes start to feel copied after it crosses the twenty mark. There are twists, there are some unknown actors and rising star actors in the feature, but for the most part it's an average action/thriller with a big name star.<br/><br/>Liam (who people will recognize from ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" as the wicked cool 'Qui-Gon Jinn') drives the movie as the sole participant and basically only known actor. I'm going on a limb and saying this is his best performance of his career, thus far. The action is well done, the pace is at a great, quick speed and the ride is fun for everyone able to be admitted.<br/><br/>There's ""eye candy"" for all genders and all ages. There's some quick, clever, subtle, witty retorts that some will chuckle, some will laugh out loud and some will sit there confused. There's a missing element of romance, but this is as I've stated, an action movie. There are a few key scenes that will not be forgotten.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it's a great film. The supporting cast could've been selected better. The kill scenes could've been varied instead of using the same MO for 20-30 men. It does just dip into the world of ""unrealistic"" and has a ""Commando"" vibe on how one man is able to take out 60 men without being much more than flesh wounded. For some, like me, that will infringe the film's rating and overall opinion.<br/><br/>If you don't look at it in that aspect, you'll enjoy it very much. I'm sure I'll be picking up the DVD when it hits the shelves at my local department store and may just end up going to view it once or twice more at the theaters. Who knows? I do know that, anyone who enjoys action in the least will have a good time watching Taken."

The action scenes (almost non-stop) were very fresh; the stunts performed were quite original and you never noticed any switches to any ""stunt doubles"". For an old retiree he sure knew how to handle himself.<br/><br/>You really feel the main character is a complete hero as well as what every dad would want to be in a similar situation - completely in the right although some of his methods could have been defined as unethical (a little revenge mixed with the righteousness of it all).<br/><br/>The relationships between the characters was also quite believable.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","After a rather long set up opening segment, with painfully obvious dialogue and scenes to give ""clues"" on where this was headed, 'Taken' doesn't, well, take us anywhere we don't already know where it's going (from the zillion trailers or simply just the opening set-up) and all the way to the final act. However, what a ride it was. Thoroughly enjoyable action scenes, Liam Neeson (seriously, one of the best actors of all time and we still forgive you for 'Star Wars' Episode 1, even though you did the best with what George would allow) was again excellent and it contained a lot of funny and smart lines, mostly from Neeson. I always enjoy Jean Grey (uh, Famke Janssen) but in this film, she was an obvious one-note, as were all the characters outside of Neeson. Strange, for someone so incredibly non-violent in our reality, he's just deadly in 'Taken' and really shows us what 'The Bourne Retirement Home' will look like once Matt Damon finally grows up. This is strictly for fans of the 'Bourne' films, Fox's '24' series and Neeson. Predictable, yes, unoriginal, well, yeah, and it doesn't trump 'Bourne' (nowhere close) but it was exciting to see what Neeson's Bryan would do next or how he would get out of a situation. I'm glad writer Luc Besson didn't include his staple Jason Statham to play the lead character, Bryan, as he would definitely fit the role. Neeson saved what would've been just a retread  retired  revenge  romp. Bryan: ""I'm retired. Not dead."" Enough said."

","TAKEN with Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen and Xander Berkeley, directed by Pierre Morel.<br/><br/>THIS gritty, violent English language, French action thriller finds Liam Neeson (""Schindler's List"", ""Rob Roy"") playing Bryan, an ex-CIA operative who goes on a rescue rampage when his attractive teenage daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), is kidnapped by Albanian sex traffickers while touring Europe. Once the premise has been set up, ""Taken"" explodes into relentless action. The haunted and determined-looking Bryan, whose physical skills are deadly, has 96 hours to get to Kim before her virginity is auctioned off to the highest bidder. Thus he is prepared to kill, maim or torture any criminal scumbag who stands in his way. As the tag line says; ""They took his daughter. He'll take their lives."" There is nothing subtle about producer Luc Besson's new movie, and the vigilante morality is somewhat suspect, but the hugely sympathetic Neeson makes this non-stop actioner work and many, many viewers will get a kick out of watching the big guy terminate criminals and perverts with extreme prejudice. ""Taken"", which comes with sensational fight scenes, blistering car chases and slick shoot-outs, plays like a hybrid of ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""Death Wish"".

","""I'm retired, but not dead"", Brian Mills, a former CIA agent tells a friend in Paris when he can't understand how he manages to get any kind of information about anything. Mills, played by Liam Neeson with unstoppable force and as an old-fashioned vigilante who fears no one and kills everyone in every room he sets foot in; is in Paris because his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, 25 and capturing the essence of a 17 year-old) was kidnapped by some Albanians while on vacation with a friend.<br/><br/>That's all about the plot, and even if you know how it ends, it's not everything about ""Taken"". It's no coincidence that Pierre Morel, the director of the movie, was the cinematographer of ""The Transporter"" and ""Danny the Dog""; and of course it's less of a coincidence that Luc Besson, writer of those films, wrote this film (alongside Robert Mark Kamen, who also wrote 'Transporter') and produced it.<br/><br/>Besson never ceases to amaze me. This whole decade, he has created a new kind of action piece and reshaped it, again and again. I'm not sure if I know the exact formula yet, but I can tell you some of the elements. I use the word 'reshape' because Besson's writing material is never original, but it never sounds repeated. The same happens with the action itself; whether it's Corey Yuen's fantastic use of cars in 'Transporter', Leterrier's excellent management of the fight scenes in 'Dog' or Morel's wonderful car chase scene around a trailer-or any single frame of a gunshot, for that matter- in this movie, the producer always gets the best out of the directors he chooses.<br/><br/>""Taken"" is so straightforward in his development, and this is respected by the whole cast and crew and assures the success of every moment of every scene in front of the viewer. The parental relationship Besson is so obsessed about and never fully developed (watch 'Dog', ""Wasabi"", ""Leon"", ""Nikita"" to experience the pieces) is the basis of the moving content of the film, and it's written with enviable intelligence. When Kim is kidnapped and his father decides to look for her desperately, we don't know very much about him, or her, or their relationshipAnd somehow that's precisely why we root for him, for a man who burns down every place he visits. By not giving us enough information of the characters, Besson leaves us no choice but to believe in Neeson's confident face-and fate-, no matter what.<br/><br/>Brian, with this confidence, says (and not to a friend): ""I'll hunt you, I'll find you and I'll kill you"". The movie doesn't waste time in unnecessary dialogs, shots, or scenes. This father always goes right to the point, and the camera goes with him skipping everything in the way. As I told you, you may know how it ends, but you can't imagine how impressive the ride in between is."

","Absolutely well crafted movie. Great performance by Liam Neeson- he gets into the skin of the character and his face shows pain of a father, i don't think anyone could have suited for that role better, he was very believable as an ex-agent or ""preventer"" and his body language was also very much to the character. The plot is fast and dialogues short but effective. A special mention to the cinematography will be needed as the director being a cinematographer himself has given the movie an urban sleek look.<br/><br/>There were times in the movie which made me really scary about people i know being in a similar situation, human trafficking, though the its just hinted in the earlier part of the movie. <br/><br/>Though only one small complaint, the editing in the chase sequences was too sharp, it doesn't allow you to grasp whats going on for few seconds and after that its over.

","I was interested of this movie for two reasons: Liam Neeson as a bad-ass and secondly if the what trailer promised was delivered - ruthless action using the idea ""a preferably divorced cop/agent/criminal comes out of retirement for one last job/kill"". The movie delivered both.<br/><br/>The action was pleasantly brutal in the vein of the newer Bond films, the classic Rambo style slaughter is done more low-key and maybe a bit believably: Neeson kicked butt mostly by doing karate chops to the throat which I can imagine is sufficiently painful and efficient - no face punching here, except if the said face is used to punch a wall or perhaps a car.<br/><br/>There was a short torture scene, although it was done by the good guy to the bad guy. Also, I liked how it was clear Neeson wanted his daughter back, period. There was plenty collateral damage and nod towards that a good guy is not exactly good all the time, not all people got what they deserved etc. I don't know how realistic the premise of sex slaves being auctioned was but at least it didn't revolve entirely around that.<br/><br/>I loved how the movie makers had realized 90 minutes is enough. If it is not, your action is not paced fast enough. The ending could have been much better (like, Liam shoots the last bad guy in the head, a scared look from the girl, cue end titles, sort of how French Connection 2 ends), especially how fast the action before that was. Now it was there as if the viewer would have cared about that annoying chick from Lost and her pops.<br/><br/>Some of the dialog was just awful. I don't know what it was but the short monologue by Neeson that was also in the trailer (""I don't know who you are"" etc.) didn't work. Maybe he just doesn't have that something in his voice that would make that kind of stuff work. But in the context of the movie it worked well enough, since it's an action movie and of course describes the entire plot (for the trailer). The annoying chick from Lost was sometimes just terrible to watch, especially since she was supposed to be seventeen.<br/><br/>Final line: it's no Frantic (and I can't remember if it even was that good a movie) but worth wasting 90 minutes of your life. A good enough movie, nothing horribly annoying."

There was also something very unsettling about the ""shopping for girls"" scene as it was so dehumanised.<br/><br/>There was one question though that were left unanswered: How in the hell can they justify casting Maggie Grace as a 17 year old? Four years ago she was playing an 18 year old on Lost and here were at the end of 2008 and she has de-aged yet again and don't get me started on her run - she makes Phoebe from Friends run look elegant.<br/><br/>It is a great action movie with some laughs.

However the trip proves disastrous as both Kim and her friend are kidnapped by Albanian sex-traffickers.<br/><br/>The story unfolds in a very mechanistic manner and as such also plays out in a linear and expected fashion. This does not make for a lesser story, but it does feel too conservative for the film in its entirety, and the end result is a film which lacks the complexities which the themes explored involve. Still it is entertaining and thankfully never falters, though some events are somewhat out of realism's grasp. By the film's end, Taken has a profound impact due to its subject matter. Nothing is overly explicit and the theme of the sex-trade is not dealt with meticulous realism, but it is captured well enough to make it seem tangible. Half the reason is due to the the directors ability to make the characters appeal on a personal level. <br/><br/>Bryan's concern for his daughter is touching, though perhaps a little overbearing first. But when danger comes to Kim, Bryan no longer appears to have any fault: he was right in his judgement. This is not a problem, but in fact a keen reminder of the role a parent plays in their child's life. Neeson plays the role, for the most part, quite convincingly. He shows some genuine concern, and when faced with the task of an action role, Neeson kicks into gear with a riveting performance. However there are moments where he comes across as mundane, and not totally involved with his character. Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen play adequate supporting roles with both showing believable emotion at the dire and horrifying situation the character Kim finds herself in. Though it must said that Maggie has a very strange way of running that can seem rather bothersome; perhaps that is he way of running, as weird as it looks, or maybe she was an ill choice to play a 17-year old.<br/><br/>While an integral theme is that revolving around the idea of sex, there is none shown in the film. Nudity is also not shown though some women come close. Language is almost non-existent though blasphemy does appear every once and a while. The film is quite strong on violence, though it is neither gory or bloody. Fights involve mainly hand-to-hand combat with a healthy does of gunfire. It is all quite engaging and exciting to watch, with Byran coming across as a more complete and violent version of Jason Bourne or the rebooted James Bond.<br/><br/>As perhaps gathered, the film is not exactly realistic though it is the sort of film which could and deserves to be so if it wishes to rank among the best of cinema. This aside, Taken is a thoroughly enjoyable film with intense action, marred by a few inconsistencies and lack of foresight into the film's overall image."

","I love the fact that Taken has been released in here (Lima, Peru) before the United States. This kind of thing happens only every so often, and it gives local critics (such as me) the opportunity to review the movie with a fresh perspective, without the influence of more well-known, possibly American reviewers. It also makes it really difficult for one to have any information on the movie  since it hasn't been released in the US, few people have seen it, so finding stuff about the plot or the shooting is harder. So yes, I didn't know what to expect from Taken. Well, it turns out Taken is a pretty good flick, maybe even better than one would expect from a Luc Besson action flick.<br/><br/>Even though Taken is a pretty by-the-numbers revenge flick, it manages to be compelling thanks, in part, to Pierre Morel's direction. I like it because it gives the movie an undeniable sense of urgency  it is stylized without being too exaggerated, making use of  not so  quick cuts and shaky cam, but without making the film too shaky. (At least it's not Bourne Supremacy-shaky.) Action sequences are exciting, tense, and expertly choreographed. I'm not saying the action in Taken is 100% original and revolutionary, but what Besson, Kamen and Morel provide is exciting enough to make one forget that we've seen car chases in films about three thousand times. I like the way Bryan dispatches all his enemies  he definitely looks like he knows what he's doing  and the way all the action sequences seem to have consequences. They are shot in a gritty, realistic fashion, which means people actually die and the French actually care when Bryan kills and injures people. (This gives way to a subplot concerning a friend of his working for the French government.) If I were to compare this movie with other of Besson's action flicks, I'd say it is, to a certain extent, the ""anti-Transporter."" While the Jason Statham movies were all over-the-top and exaggerated (especially the second one), Taken is more of a reality-based, believable movie.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, the film's greatest strength lies on Liam Neeson's performance. Even though the film's script is pretty average  and sometimes unintentionally funny  the fact Neeson treats the material so seriously makes one believe in his quest. I like the man's voice, the way he makes even the most clichéd piece of dialogue sound so important within the context of the movie, and the way he threatens the bad guys. He always sounds in control, calmed and sometimes even dangerous. One actually believes he's an expert, and that's he's willing to kill the bad guys to save his daughter. He also looks believable during the action sequences  I can't say if stunt doubles were used or not, but from what I've seen, I can say Neeson is really effective at looking like a total badass. The only gripe I would have with his character is that he was sometimes a little too brutal, which made rooting for him a little hard  the way he tortures a villain  using electricity  was particularly disturbing.<br/><br/>The rest of the performances are good, I guess, but here's no one that stands out as much as Neeson. Famke Janssen has a small, thankless role as Bryan's ex-wife. She gets angry and screams and cries a lot, but we really don't get to know much about their former relationship. Maggie Grace is not bad as Kim. At the beginning of the movie she irritated me a little  she and her friend, actually  because they acted a little too stupidly and immaturely for my taste  actually, it is because of this attitude that they get kidnapped  but I eventually forgot that and concentrated on her father's quest. Xander Berkeley and Leland Orser also have small  but vital  roles, but never really manage to take the spotlight from Neeson. The film belongs to him.<br/><br/>I liked Taken because it's exciting and tense, and because it provides with a great performance and solid storytelling. Liam Neeson is as good as he's been in practically every film he's acted in, and director Pierre Morel directs Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen's workmanlike screenplay with flair and style to make the audience forget about the clichés one inevitably finds in all revenge flicks. This is the kind of hero that's perfect for an actor like Liam Neeson: skilled and intelligent, but also flawed. (One feels a little pity for him at the beginning because of the way he's treated by his ex-wife.) I liked the fact that the action was gritty and realistic, and found the dealing of the underworld of women trafficking and the Albanese mafia in the screenplay both intriguing and disturbing. If I had to use only one word to describe Taken, that would be ""intense""."
"Kaliopau","7","0","2","19 September 2008"," Taken
","Definitely the best action flick since the Bourne series. Neeson gave a spell binding performance that we haven't seen him done in years. Good films always has minor let downs and the same thing occurs in Taken. First of all the film was as actioned packed as it could get but some of the fight sense were repeated over and over witch was a bit annoying i wonder if they did this to make it easier for Neeson or did the fight choreographer run out of moves. And the biggest fault of all was the happy ending, i don't know about you but if i was kidnapped, drugged and sold i even being rescued i wouldn't be happy instantly i would at least be a little paranoia or traumatize, not laugh is off and go do singing lessons that is just plain absurd. However i give Taken a clean 7/10"
"pimping_uk","7","0","2","4 September 2008"," Neeson rises above a B level bourne / Jack Bauer
","This film does what you expect, but it covers a few issues that might have been the very reason Neeson signed on. Kidnapping, prostitution, sex slavery, immigration etc.<br/><br/>The action and fight scenes are fine, but too heavily cut at times for you to actually see some of the moves. Some points in the film everyone just gets shot easily and quickly. Which take away the gritty realism the film was trying to achieve.<br/><br/>There are few good scenes with Neeson and Grace on the phone where he tells her she will be kidnapped. Other then that it just about rises above the direct to DVD action movies we Segal doing right now."
