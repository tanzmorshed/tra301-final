","This movie is atrocious beyond words, and the first movie from which I've ever walked out (an hour and 17 minutes into it). The session was full of giggling middle-aged women, wetting themselves with anticipation - I cannot believe this book and movie has appeal. Are women really so bored, so desperate, that this is what gets them off?? The acting was appalling - I guess that's the end of Ms Johnson & Mr Dornan's careers. And I wouldn't be surprised if the actors who refused the role of Christian Grey are secretly relieved they had the sense to reject it! The script was laughable. No chemistry between the two leads. As for the 'eroticism'.....it was completely lacking. Stilted, awkward, poor cinematography, cheesy scripting. Just terrible. <br/><br/>Do not waste your time or money with this."
"blanche-2","1","728","943","12 February 2015"," Yeah, I'm sorry, it is that bad
","""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is based on a badly written book, so why someone thought they could make a decent film out of it is beyond me. Actually I don't think anyone believed they could make a good film, the producers just wanted the money that would come in from all people who for reasons known only to themselves read the book.<br/><br/>I had a free ticket and I had to go in order to do a story on it. Bottom line, I'm not doing a story on it.<br/><br/>Okay, here's the problem, and this is what breaks my heart. We no longer know what good or great is. I am no follower of Ayn Rand, but in The Fountainhead, she predicted the rise of mediocrity, mediocrity being considered great and the norm we shoot for. It only stands to reason that at this point, some things can't even rise to that sad level. This isn't mediocre, it's pathetic. I can't believe there are people complimenting the actors. But then I can, because they have come to accept mediocrity. Something I fight against with all my heart.<br/><br/>There is one other problem. The book sucked; in order to like it, one had to use his or her imagination. The success of this book lay in the fantasy aspect. Sometimes imagination is more powerful than just about anything and can give you an erotic experience. This film doesn't fulfill the most inane imagination, let alone someone who really has a wild and creative one. The only fantasy it can give you is how fast you can get out of the theater.<br/><br/>There were people around me laughing. The ones who weren't left, and from what I found out in the lobby, actually demanded and got their money back. When was the last time you saw people leaving a movie in the middle? I'm not sure I've ever seen it, and I'll guess I've been going to movies longer than a lot of you.<br/><br/>I lament the loss of artistic soul, of creativity, of going for the best. I miss the days when Billy Wilder was a writer and a filmmaker. What are we left with but a horrible book written on a first grade level and the resulting bad movie."

","I don't want to spoil a lot, so ill just give ratings with a brief description on certain elements of this so-called ""film"".<br/><br/>Acting; 3/10. The acting was misplaced, awkward.. not to look at. At least convince us you're an intense guy, Mr. Grey. <br/><br/>Plot: 1/10. that wasn't a plot for a normal movie, it was a plot for soft-core porn.. which had as terrible acting in it as real porn. <br/><br/>Camera work/scenery/etc. 7/10 for what it is.. great camera work i guess and good scenery<br/><br/>Romance; 2/10. I've seen the notebook... that's romance. This is a poor attempt to romance. It tries to tell you they're madly in love, but it's just a weird sexual relationship.<br/><br/>Drama: 1/10. there is no thrill.. no intense things going on. There is no drama in this soft-core-erotic-drama. <br/><br/>""The deeds"" 10/10.. they did it. so.. can't give it any lower points than this. <br/><br/>Overall, it's was horrible acted, plot-less, non-romantic nor drama movie about a girl being horny and the guy doing an attempt of BDSM, which comes down to.. soft-core.. almost nothing different than normal sex with bondage.. boring sh*t. <br/><br/>on that note, go watch the kings man; secret service. that's one of the best action movies i've seen in a while!"

","Okay. So I have not read the book, (being a male), and I went with one of my female friends who HAD read the book, (and she said she had enjoyed it) -- although having said that, she had read it a number of years ago. <br/><br/>We paid our money and we took our seats. The film began; and I have to say that the wooden acting, the cruddy screenplay, the corny dialogue, the ridiculous script, the highly improbable storyline, were all just TOO much for us! (And not just us it seems! As we could hear titters from the audience at large as well coming from dialogue within the story that were supposed to be serious scenes -- so not just us I hasten to add)...<br/><br/>We gave it half an hour and then I leaned over to my friend and said ""Do you think there's any chance they will give us our money back?? What do you think to it?"" -- and thank God she replied, ""Oh thank Heavens you said that; I can't stand it another minute! Lets just get outta here!!!!!!! It's just terrible"".<br/><br/>We got our money back. We complained it was nothing like the book and that we demanded a refund as had only seen half an hour of the movie, and hey presto they refunded my credit card! No questions asked! <br/><br/>I give this rubbish 1 star; and that was for the pretty outdoor scenery! <br/><br/>Don't waste your time with it -- it is Hollywood at it's worst."

","You simply can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The book was unquestionably the worst piece of writing I'd ever encountered, so what the hell were they thinking in making this rubbish? Apart from the tedium of the plod (read plot), the script is cobbled together with hollow dialogue, countless use of retch-inducing signifiers and clich√©, a complete lack of chemistry between the characters and predictable scenarios and outcomes at every turn. I got the feeling throughout the film that both these actors were desperate to get off the set, go home (but certainly to separate houses), drown their shared humiliation with a stiff drink or ten, and set fire to their contracts. Woeful book. Woeful film. Don't waste your money on this drivel. There are Fifty Reasons to STAY AWAY."

","I was in the mood for a great film about a young girl who meets a successful and seductive businessman with sexy results. This was not the case. This film was purely awful. No one can blame me for not being in the right frame of mind for the cinema, as some reviewers are. They see a film and end up having a bad night and they put the entire blame on the film, this is not the case for me. I was in a positive frame of mind, and really in the mood to see what I thought would be a somewhat good if not better than mediocre film.<br/><br/>This film is about two people who have no chemistry ""falling"" for each other. ""Falling"" like off a three story balcony leaving you without the use of your legs for the rest of your life. I'm just going to be blunt. This film is about GLORIFYING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE and a little girl in over her head who tolerates it. The man in the relationship, Chris, in a career-ending performance portrayed by Jamie Doormat, is a control-freak who must be in control in everything he does, including the life of his BDSM buddy, Ana.<br/><br/>Not only does he creep onto her, HE BEATS HER, non-consensually while they have intercourse, he stalks her, HE INTIMIDATES HER and he shows no love for her. If this were any other film, he would be the antagonist. If you're in the mood for a movie that shows what true love is, I suggest you see Mrs. Doubtfire, as that film is about a loving family man who shows his dedication and support to his wife, even after they are separated, and his children, by dressing up as an elderly female babysitter. <br/><br/>50 Shades of Brown gets 1/10 stars from me as I am unable to give A BIG FAT ZERO."

","Sorry but I can't get over Jamie Doran.. I mean he comes from playing a serial killer in the Fall (who tied up women and murdered them) to .. Well. 20 mins of sex. The movie is boring and predictable. The fine line between abuse and pleasure is so thin it's almost non- existent. Lacks any of the raunch or controversy promised, and is instead tiresome, banal and as thinly plotted as a porn. I haven't read the book.. and I have to say I didn't finish the movie. I don't think i missed much by leaving 20 mins early, but it was just boring. If a man had written the book he would probably have been jailed. Its beyond understanding what people see in the book/movie. Unless all the women I know are telling me lies and secretly want to be tied up and abused by a perverted man."
"lycaniism","1","553","773","9 February 2015"," Terrible to BDSM Community and to Women.
","Another sad movie with a generic plot with the Mary Sue / Gary Sue relationship. A relationship so horrid that it reaches a limit when rape is involved. This book turned movie is a mere reminder that 'Hollywood' will create anything without investigating the rather obvious 'unusual behavior' -- which, lets be honest here, isn't unusual until you put a married man and a girl who cannot bite her lip for the life of her in the same room. It is more than evident there is no chemistry on set, and off set. Jamie, you could have done so much better. Dakota, no, just no. Thank you, EL for your horrible outlook on BDSM and your plagiarized mistake of a 'book'. You truly have given writers everywhere a reason to wish they'd never written, and a reason as to why actors never wish to take part in anything that relates to this horrible mess of a movie."
"versispefende","1","285","398","12 February 2015"," Fifty Shades of No.
","As an active member of BDSM community, and having been a part of it for six years, I am appalled by the 'blockbluster romantic movie' that everyone deems to be 'romantic'. You take a Mary Sue - also known as Dakota Johnson to whom lacks the ability to a) bite her lower lip in a 'sexual' manner', let alone say her lines as if she's been acting for several years ( lets be honest here, she cannot act ) / Gary Sue - seen as the bearded wonder that was Jamie Dornan, a married man outside of his acting career with a child - situation that holds no evidence of sexual tension. <br/><br/>The inability to further deepen the bond between Dominate and submissive was, how does one say it, horrible in effort. What appeared to be every 'womans' dream man became a man known for raping a woman purely because of his night terrors, a man to whom devoted taking the idea of BDSM and creating abuse rather than listening and allowing for someone - mind you, who had no sexual ID or preference until meeting him - who was about as 'vanilla' as the ice cream itself, to study and look at the idea of BDSM. To those whom have taken the books route and ventured into the dark abyss that is Wikipedia to figure out what BDSM is, needs to be caned. <br/><br/>The author, herself, takes an already published series turned movie, and makes it into her own idea. A 26 year old billionaire? Unlikely in this day and age with the way the economy is. A college student with a rather unnerving need to say 'oh my' every other second? Really? Is THIS what writing as the point of view of a woman has come down to? It seems like, although we argue against it, and we say that we don't condone it, that the women whom have read this book, have seen this movie, will and have ignored that there is rape, non consensual sex, and heavy amounts of verbal and emotional abuse. Who really wants a man who is going to control their eating habits, sleep schedule and more? Certainly not I. <br/><br/>To be frank, everyone knows this movie is going to gross millions upon its release; why? Because everyone is all hyped up to see a movie with little to no chemistry, to find that the 'unusual behavior' is just another way of life. We magnify all the little things in the world that we've yet to uncover, but BDSM should never be something in the movies, should never be written; especially by women in their 'mid life crisis' age with no idea what the sensation of a crop lashing at skin feels like.<br/><br/>If you want good BDSM, or to understand it, there are people willing to discuss it, websites you can go on - although extremely sexual in nature - to figure out what true BDSM looks like, what it sounds like. When this book was written, it was evident that EL James did not do her own 'research'.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a movie with no plot, with no true build to it with horribly written characters and nothing more. So why spend nearly good money seeing this sad mistake when you can spend that money on getting something to eat and staying inside? Complete and total thumbs down to the movie, the book, the series, and to the author."

","When the end credits began to roll, I was given a fleeting look by the people sitting next to me in the cinema. They were probably checking to see if I was still alive; such was my horror and, quite frankly, disbelief, I had not moved from the same position for at least an hour. A wide-opened mouth, bulging eyes and clenched fists on the armrests at my sides. No, I was not enamoured with the movie. No, I did not find the scenes of bondage shocking. I had simply lost the will to live. <br/><br/>One might remember a famous novel by a famous author, '1984'. Until I walked out of that movie house, I didn't know what had spurned Orwell's mind in the creation of his dystopian society, but now I have a vague idea. Orwell wasn't afraid of being stalked by the government - he was terrified that future society would become the way it is today. <br/><br/>I'm not referring to high-octane sexual fantasies, because we all have our own desires and it's not my place to judge. No, what Orwell envisaged, surely, is acting so terrible, movies so poorly made and producers so incompetent, that the likes of Hitchcock and Bogart are probably turning in their graves. <br/><br/>With laughter. <br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey is a mediocre work by a laughable author of FanFiction, meaning that without the abysmal Twilight series, the TRULY abysmal movie that I have suffered through today could not have existed. Someone get me a DeLorean and a Flux Capacitor; it's time to right a few wrongs.<br/><br/>There is only one sure-fire way to improve this catastrophe and that is, quite literally, with fire. Burn it. Burn it all to ash and spread the cinders across the resting ground of Cthulhu. Without this worthy sacrifice, surely the monster will rise up to wreak havoc upon us deserving mortals. <br/><br/>All in all, I have only one recommendation for the people who will, inevitably, be dragged (ironic term, given the movie) to the cinema/theatre to watch this complete abomination: therapy. Years and years of therapy. But avoid the groups. Once you see Mr. Grey's 'desires' for yourself, you'll probably be afraid to stand in the same room as another human being for, oh, several hundred millennia.<br/><br/>And there's worse to come: rumours talk of a trilogy, to keep things up to speed with the 'books'. What's that sound? Oh, it's just the splatter of the blood I'm currently weeping. I'm sure that's unrelated...<br/><br/>Right? Guys? Oh..."
"rsw7703","1","519","754","11 February 2015"," Keeping it short
","Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan had zero sex appeal, for me anyway. I hoped I was going to see something a bit more provocative than predictable. However, what unfolded on the screen was a story without enough substance. So I grabbed the first hard cover volume from my aunt's large collection of ""literature."" She warned me not to expect much and she was right. I somehow got through 150 pages of poorly written boredom and gave up. I'm glad I saw the film for free. On the positive side, I can report that the Music is by one of my favorite film composers, Danny Elfman. Plus, the soundtrack includes music from the likes of Beyonce, Ellie Golding and many others which helps but does not rescue the largely silly visual acrobatics. Maybe my opinion would be different were I a repressed housewife or middle aged spinster. But that is as stupid a remark as the movie itself, given I am a man."

This guy is the exact thing you want to avoid if you don't want to end up in an abusive relationship.

","Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) <br/><br/>** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Rather silly adaptation of the E.L. James best-seller about a shy, timid virgin (Dakota Johnson) who meets the elusive billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Doman) and soon both of their lives change.<br/><br/>Writing a plot synopsis of this thing is pretty pointless since I'm sure the target audience is already going to know the story. I guess this is where I should admit that I haven't read the book so this review won't be comparing the two or complaining about what the movie did or didn't do from the book. No, this review is just going to be based around the actual movie and for the life of me I can't see what all the hype is about. I don't expect everyone laying their money down to be some sort of film buff but the ""shocking"" material on display here has been going on in European movies for four-plus decades so why it's just now reaching American shores is pretty funny in itself but that's off subject I guess.<br/><br/>As for the film, there are all sorts of major issues with it but we can start with the laughable screenplay, which would have been rejected by the Lifetime channel and in fact, I'm going to guess that it would have been rejected has a five-year-old written it. The dialogue is without question some of the most laughable I've heard in a very long time. In fact, the movie seems to be lost in what decade it is because there are times that the ""F"" word is used and it's used in a way to where it's supposed to be shocking. Really? It's going to take more than that. The entire character development between the two lead characters is another joke and after a while you really can't buy into any of the melodrama and you've just got to sit back and laugh.<br/><br/>The performances are another problem but then again, even the likes of Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor couldn't work with horrid material so I'm not going to be too harsh on Johnson and Doman. With that said, the lackluster direction by Sam Taylor-Johnson doesn't help either as there are many times where another take should have happened. The scenes with Johnson playing the shy girl just aren't very believable because the actress can't sell it. The scenes of her explaining she's a virgin are laughably bad. Doman really doesn't get much to work with and especially since he can't crack a smile and has to give off dumb, overly-serious facial expressions throughout. I will say that the actors have a nice chemistry together but that's about it. The supporting players are all equally forgettable.<br/><br/>Yet another problem is that the film just isn't erotic. FATAL ATTRACTION, BASIC INSTINCT and even something as silly as BODY OF EVIDENCE are just a few recent films that packed a lot more punch than this one. I mean, is sticking an eraser around your lips really erotic anymore? A lot of the lack of erotic-ness has to be blamed on the director who just seems to have been the wrong fit for the material. Nothing from the erotic nature to the serious stuff works and everything is poorly edited.<br/><br/>So, why the two-stars for all the negative stuff? As bad as the film is, thankfully it reaches the level to where you can't help but laugh and be mildly entertained as to what's going to happen next. Again, I haven't read the book so I don't know which one is better but the film is pretty flat from start to finish."

","Despite its unsavory sadomasochistic subject matter, this cinematic adaptation of author E.L. James' erotic bestseller ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" qualifies as puritanical. I can say this because I managed to get through ten chapters of the book before I saw the Universal Pictures release. ""Nowhere Boy"" director Sam Taylor-Johnston and ""Saving Mr. Banks"" scenarist Kelly Marcel have sanitized James' novel and turned it into an antiseptic, ""Cinderella"" fairy tale about an affluent Prince Charming and a book-wormy English Lit major. Not that it matters, director Sam Taylor-Johnston is a woman rather than a man. Johnston and Marcel have forged a film that features simulated sex scenes without steam and cardboard characters without souls. Mind you, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" isn't as abysmal as the amateurish ""Addicted."" Johnston stages several sex scenes where actress Dakota Johnson bares only her breasts, while actor Jamie Dornan displays little more than his carefully sculpted abs and buttocks. Ladies hoping for a glimpse of male genitalia are going to be sorely frustrated because ""Fifty Shades"" is R-rated rather than NC-17, like both ""Shame"" (2011) and ""The Lover"" (1992) where full frontal nudity was conspicuous. Comparatively speaking, little if anything risqu√© occurs until the concluding scene. You won't see anything like the candle dripping sex in the Madonna movie ""Body of Evidence"" (1993); the kitchen sink sex between Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction,"" or the infamous ""Last Tango in Paris"" where Marlon Brando improvised on Maria Schneider with a blob of butter. Subsequent adaptations of James' two novels may pass up on the prudish approach after Universal studio executives have analyzed audience tolerance. Altogether, this soft-porn entry in the trilogy shouldn't hoist anybody's eyebrows.<br/><br/>Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnston of ""The Five Year Engagement"") is a shy, virginal, doe-eyed brunette who majors in English Lit at Washington State University and works at a hardware store. She shares an apartment with her best friend, blond-haired Kate Kavanagh (Eloise Mumford of ""In the Blood""), who serves as the campus newspaper editor. As the action unfolds, woebegone, pajama-clad Kate is wrestling with a cold. Kate persuades Anastasia to pinch hit for her on a newspaper assignment. She sends her out to interview bachelor billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan of ""Marie Antoinette"") who rules a colossal corporate empire. Basically, Christian is the Bruce Wayne of hanky-spanky. An orphan who survived the death of his crack-addict mom, Christian has amassed a fortune, but he harbors a deep, dark secret. When she enters 'The House of Grey,' Anastasia knows little about him. Anxious about her assignment, Anastasia makes a klutz of herself when she enters Grey's office. No sooner has she crossed the threshold than she stumbles and crumples to her hands and knees. Realizing she hasn't made the best impression, Anastasia recovers her confidence and begins the interview. Initially, Christian adopts an icy attitude toward her, but he thaws out once they start talking. Christian finds the way Anastasia chews her lip so irresistible that he cancels his next appointment. Some of Kate's questions shock Anastasia, particularly when she quizzes the tycoon about his sexual orientation. A life-long bachelor who has never been photographed in public with a woman, Christian explains that he has little use for conventional romances with hearts and flowers. A relieved Anastasia leaves Christian behind in his phallic monolith of a building and cruises home. As it turns out, Anastasia is just as captivated with Christian as the latter is with her. Later, they go on a date, and eventually he deflowers her. He wants Anastasia to join him in a sexual liaison as a 'submissive' to his 'dominant.' Christian and she negotiate terms of a contract. For example, the open-minded Anastasia has no problems with being tied up and titillated with a peacock feather, but she draws the line at vaginal fisting and genital clamps. Meantime, Christian does everything he can to corrupt Anastasia, buying her a Mac notebook and replacing her classic Volkswagen Beetle with a shiny red Audi. Ultimately, Christian convinces our heroine to let him show her how bondage can be enjoyable. Nevertheless, Anastasia isn't as gullible as she seems. At fade-out, she gains the upper hand in their bizarre relationship.<br/><br/>The casting in ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" creates half of the problem. Dakota Johnson makes an ideal Anastasia. She gives a believable performance as a na√Øve college student who has just graduated and treasures the kind classic 19th century British fiction that Thomas Hardy wrote. The Austin, Texas, born actress seems wholly comfortable with her casual nudity, and it is interesting to note that ""Miami Vice's"" Don Johnson is her dad and Melanie Griffith of ""Something Wild"" is her mom. She isn't as goofy as her literary counterpart. Sadly, lean, handsome Jamie Dornan doesn't cut the mustard. He doesn't behave like a ruthless cutthroat who owns a billion dollar corporation, and his performance is considerably less spontaneous. Although he wears his apparel well and delivers his dialogue with crisp precision, Dornan looks more like a callow amateur. In all fairness to Dornan, he impersonates a character that doesn't seem remotely believable, and his lack of personality underlines his lightweight performance. The other big problem is the film seems as impersonal as a bargain basement torture rack. Basically, Johnston and Marcel have designed it as a bondage primer that cautiously advances from one elaborate interlude to another without drumming up any melodrama. Primarily, the filmmakers rely more on winks rather than winces as our heroine navigates the dire straits of Christian's sexual calisthenics. Keep in mind, Anastasia doesn't say no until she knows better. Gradually, Christian peels back the layers of his paranoia, revealing himself as an onion that initiates our heroine's tears and fears. When director Sam Johnston shifts the focus from the game of sexual chess between Anastasia and Christian, the film sacrifices suspense. Undeniably, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" will keep your eyes wide open, but it dwells more on tease instead of sleaze."

","50 Shades of Grey. The title suggests a nuanced film where nothing is black or white and motivations are murky and changeable.<br/><br/>Nothing could be further from the truth, I'm afraid. Jimmy Dorman, who plays the titular Mr Grey, has all the nuance and subtlety of a sledgehammer. Further, his supposed sex appeal is non-existent. He's about as appealing as Pennywise the clown, from Stephen King's It, but about twice as creepy! Anastasia Steele, by contrast, gives the impression that she is of sub-par intelligence and is exactly as interesting as listening to your Grandpa's old war stories... for the hundredth time.<br/><br/>There is an utter lack of anything like chemistry between the pair and their entire ""relationship"" is based around him abusing her and her supposedly enjoying it. Now, I don't have a problem with BDSM whatsoever, but the thing I do know about it is that it is entirely consensual between both parties. If it isn't, then it isn't BDSM, it's plain and simple abuse.<br/><br/>Of course, there are those that would argue that, in the context of the movie, the ""consent"" was clear and obvious because the woman was content to let it happen. But that is treading on mighty thin ice, friends, and sounds more like justification, than any real argument as to consent.<br/><br/>In short, this movie offended me and made me laugh all at the same time, which is rare for a movie to do. I think I was more non-plussed that anyone would find it entertaining and that, along with the awful chemistry and poor acting, made me find humour in it. But I suppose I'm an old fart because I find something distasteful about the subject material. I know, it is a work of fiction, and we should all be able to distinguish fantasy from reality, right? Well, yes, but I have the sneaking suspicion that, despite its ""R"" rating, an awful lot of young girls are going to see this movie and if so, then the message this movie sends to them is entirely the wrong one.<br/><br/>But, enough of my preaching. It sucks. I looked at my watch many times during the film and went for a stroll around the foyer about half way through so that I might let my eyes witness more interesting things. There was a discarded movie stub that occupied me for several minutes, before I felt obligated to return to the auditorium for the second half of this dreary non-event.<br/><br/>The fact that they released it the day before Valentine's Day just leaves me speechless with disbelief.<br/><br/>EDIT: Of course this made a ton of money at the box office, so there will be a sequel, and plenty of similar, ripoffs. Remember when we all bemoaned the ""new"" craze of Young Adult, Dystopian fantasy films? Welcome to the next big genre folks! Soft-porn at the cinema!<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Ridiculous, badly acted and lacking anything like entertainment. No chemistry between the two leads. Glorifies abuse and then tries to tell you that is what you wanted all along. Just a waste of your time. Trust me."

","Fifty shades is an awful film no doubt, but it had to be made no question, and here is why. Purely from an economic standpoint Comcast, that owns Universal had no choice. How could they say to their share holders that they passed on such a cash cow, allowing Warner, Fox or Sony to rake in the profits that this movie is guaranteed to make. The board meeting probably went something like this.<br/><br/>""We have an option on this book 'Fifty Shades of Grey- Now this one of the worst books ever to be written, but bear with me here, because this book is selling like hotcakes to desperate housewives everywhere. It's a no brainer we have to make this movie. The great thing is that we don't even need to make a good movie, it only has to be almost as good as the book, and since the book is so bad to begin with, that means that the bar is already set very low. We just can't fail. <br/><br/>It's not Lord of Rings, the fan base isn't looking for great quality, if they were they wouldn't have bought the book in the first place, and that means we don't need to spend much money developing the script. Neither do we need to waste money on any A list talent. Forget Tom Cruise, and Keira Knightly, just get a couple or relatively unknown actors, they don't even need to be that good as long as they can remember their lines. And we don't need to budget for a great director either. Let's face it we are not remaking Citizen Kane here, so keep Spielberg and Scorcese for another project. Heck, we don't even need to pay out for someone like Ridley Scott and he'll pretty much do anything these days. No an unknown mediocre director will do, but make sure that the director is a woman as it will help to deflect any negative PR from those folks that think fifty shades glorifies domestic abuse and the like.<br/><br/>Now here is the best part. Here is how we can make a ton of money out of this steaming dung pile. There are two days in the year when even the most Jockiest of alpha male guys who normally only watch action movies will happily take their significant other to see a chick flick. One is on her birthday, and the other is Valentines day. Since birthdays fall every day of the year, then February 14th has to be the release date. <br/><br/>Oh and as luck would have it, Valentines day this year falls on a Saturday, so not only will all the male schmucks who think taking their girl to see this pic will get them laid later, all the single ladies who don't want to be stuck inside on this evening will come out to see this movie in droves with their girlfriends. <br/><br/>Seriously guys, we've been handed a gift horse. Let's green light this thing and make ourselves a huge pile of cash""."
"thale05","7","130","201","15 February 2015"," A Fascinating, Erotic Film Perhaps Better Than We Give It Credit For
","Before the review, I think I should address one important thing: I have never read the book. That being said, you will not read any comparisons or critiques of what was left out or what was done wrong in the adaptation. I went into this movie aware of the subject matter and judged it just like any other movie. Consider this a fair review of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"".<br/><br/>Honestly, I liked this movie. I know what you're thinking: ""This guy just likes seeing people have kinky sex on the big screen."" No, I don't. In fact, I think mainstream erotic films offer us more than just artsy porn; they can be a fascinating look into the human subconscious like ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and they can be pure garbage like ""Caligula"". I have come to learn that art is not safe whether it's in the horror genre, comedy or especially in the erotic subgenre. Strangely, I found ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" to be provocative of questions about love, compromise, and passion even if it borders on what most people would consider bad taste.<br/><br/>First off, what is the movie about? Basically it follows the relationship between an inhibited English student named Anastasia Steele (played by Dakota Johnson) and a mysterious, young billionaire named Christian Grey (played by Jamie Dornan). They meet for an interview and begin building an infatuation for one another but Grey keeps insisting he does not want a romance with Ana. Instead he offers her the chance to partake in a BDSM relationship in which he is the dominant and she is the submissive. When I look back, the roles match well with their personalities.<br/><br/>There is no real story I could find in this film; rather it's more about the characters. A lot of great movies focus on their characters more than plot; in this movie, it works out okay. Many of the supporting characters are snubbed for the two main players as if to say they are just there for the sake of some filler. Maybe if others found out about Grey's lifestyle and he was caught in media frenzy, the film would have a substantial plot.<br/><br/>I found Dakota Johnson to be incredibly dull in the first act but gradually she becomes more dynamic and confident as the film progressed. It feels intentional seeing how Ana starts off as a quiet, uninteresting woman only to morph into a more liberal persona. Dakota's character has a lot of those ""whomp-whomp-whomp-whooooomp"" comedic moments in the beginning which felt so forced and unnecessary to the tone. Jamie Dornan was decent as Christian Grey. Like his character, he feels in control.<br/><br/>The sex scenes are a lot tamer than I had anticipated going into this flick. Like the rest of the movie, they are shot surprisingly crisp and, might I add, nicely-paced.<br/><br/>It sounds like a simple movie but it wasn't until I asked myself one simple question that it all became interesting: Does Grey love Ana? A lot of Grey's actions I see points to yes unless it is part of a ploy to secure a potential submissive. He claims to require a written contract before ever touching Ana but blows off this condition to passionately kiss her. And once they get to the contract, they discuss their intimate limitations in an amusing, business-like setting. Ana objects to certain practices which Grey seems to willingly extract from their relationship kind of like a compromise in any other relationship.<br/><br/>One of my favorite parts is when Ana confesses her virginity to Grey after revealing his secret life. Even though he maintains he doesn't have normal sexual relations in the bedroom, Grey breaks this code to be with Ana. One might argue it is a selfish act to gain her trust so she may serve as his victim; I see it as Grey finding an opportunity to be with someone he could briefly connect with, someone untouched, someone he sees as good. In fact, at one point, he voices his concern of Ana changing his outlook on life and sounds scared of this prospect. Grey feels constrained by his past which shaped his present only to feel the need to constrain others to his level, literally.<br/><br/>Who knows? Maybe I'm overthinking too much. Some people might be turned off, some might get turned on, some might think little about it, and some might find something special in ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". I only know what I saw and felt.<br/><br/>My Rating: 7/10"
"MsMovie","1","122","189","13 February 2015"," OMG, this is SO bad.
","I have to say right from the start that I read the entire first book and that I thought it was absolutely horrible - badly written erotica at best with a lame plot and a horribly pathetic female lead and a very unlikeable hero (who was no hero to me).<br/><br/>That out of the way, I saw Jamie Dornan was cast and heard they changed a lot of the story for the movie script and thought maybe it would be OK, but it wasn't.<br/><br/>I counted 10 people who left at some part during the movie and never came back, which is rare these days as people tend to stay to get their money's worth out of the price of the ticket.<br/><br/>The settings are nice at times and so is the music, but the acting (Jamie what were you thinking????) was so wooden. It was almost like a Saturday Night Live skit, except they weren't playing for laughs in this movie they were serious, but it was cringeworthy at best.<br/><br/>Christian Grey is no hero, and Dakota Johnson was so understated it was like she wasn't even there at all.<br/><br/>Not a good movie - definitely not a date movie (I was so irritated by it by the time I left, no one was getting lucky!).<br/><br/>The good parts of the movie - really the music is the best part and the end, because it was finally over - could have been a good 20 minutes shorter! The bad parts - the script was like a really bad 1960's Mills & Boon romance, and it was so slow you could honestly fall asleep if the acting weren't so painfully wooden.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a good mainstream movie to watch to get turned on, find one on Netflix, Google movies that are sexy, you'll find something much more titillating.<br/><br/>I am so glad some of the actors who were originally considered decided to say no, this movie could be a career killer! I hope it isn't the number 1 movie this week purely because it would be a shame if this drivel is what Americans actually want to watch and think is sexy. Men of course will enjoy the naked parts, of course they will, Dakota has a nice body, but as a woman, I don't ever want to be as wussy as Anastasia and I sure don't want women in general thinking it's OK to be abused by a guy in the name of sex.<br/><br/>Being tied up is great in a committed relationship, it's fun, it's NOT abusive - BUT in this movie, it's creepy, borderline degrading and just uncomfortable.<br/><br/>The funniest part for me (apart from the script!) was how uncomfortable the men who had clearly come in with their wives thinking they were going to get lucky later, and clearly wanted to leave and couldn't. Hilarious! I gave it a 1 out of 10 because you can't go any lower and the music really was quite good, but everything else, give this one a miss and wait for the UV code to come out - at least you won't waste as much money as 2 movie tickets, drinks, popcorn etc, and there's an OFF button on the ROKU, so you can switch this crapola off and just go have sex with your partner instead."
"lauren142003","10","214","350","15 February 2015"," I don't see what everyone's problem is
","I don't know what people were expecting. I hadn't read the books before seeing the movie and I am assuming that maybe this was a good thing. I enjoyed the film. I do not agree with the lack of chemistry either. There was a weird chemistry which I believe made sense because of the unusual relationship. He is an odd character and she is intimidated and is also very innocent therefore it isn't going to be the usual sexual chemistry that you would find in a romantic film. A lot of people have said there was not enough sex or it was not raunchy enough. Firstly, if there were any more sex scenes it would have got quite boring, and instead we got to see a bit of a story line. Also there is only so much that they can show in a film, surely? What were people expecting? Also one final point in relation to the comments I have seen regarding the film giving S&M a bad name; I don't agree. This is a specific story about one guy who is into specific things and goes about things a particular way. It was all consensual (and it is made clear that it must be). The whole point of the story is that Christian Grey's sexual desires are confusing for Anatasia to understand and that the relationship is quite complicated due to their mutual feelings for each other. I have also seen comments that this film is sexist and degrades women. This film does not promote that at all it merely shows a story of someone who practises in S&M and in this instance the man is the dominant. She has a choice as to whether she wants to engage in this and the film does not say ""this is okay"" and ""woman should do this"". The character was not forced to do anything. I do not get why people feel the need to accuse films of implying or portraying such things.<br/><br/>Obviously this film is not perfect and there are things that could have been better but I enjoyed this film and personally would recommend it to others. I can get quite bored in films but I was not bored at all, I have paid more to see films that are A LOT worse than this."

","I viewed this film and my immediate thought was, ""How come this movie has no storyline?"" This was a film comparable to a nickelodeon cartoon series, or quite possibly worse. If I could rate any lower, it would be a -3 out of 10.

I saw a movie by Disney and i vomited during the first five minutes of it, and that was better than this film. >Go on a date with girl >Take her to nice restaurant >She orders a shrimp cocktail and several drinks >Ask for the check >The waiter places the check in front of me, not in front of her, not in the middle of the table >Look of horror comes across the girl's face >I reach for the check and place my credit card inside >She begins to tremble >Tears well up in her eyes >I can tell she is paralyzed by fear at the oppression she is experiencing >I chauvinistically place the check with the my credit card on the table in front of me, daring her to do something about it >The power of my oppression of this woman surges through my body as I lean back in my seat and stare directly at her >She is shaking with fright, the oppression strangling her voice away >The waiter returns to take the check away >All is lost to her now >Men at other tables begin to stand up and clap >Women all over the restaurant begin to shriek and cry >I feel my erect penis lift the tablecloth in front of me >I ask my date, ""Did you enjoy your dinner?"" >""Y-yes... thank you"", she says behind a mask of tears >I lean forward, a devious, patriarchical smile spreading across my face >And I tell her, ""It was my privilege."""

","After reading a few reviews, I actually felt bad for loving this movie. I wanted to go and see this movie in the cinema, but all my friends trusted the reviews and just didn't come, so I went by myself. To be honest: I ended up crying for about 2 hours after watching the movie because I was extremely touched by Christian Grey's traumas. <br/><br/>I feel like a lot of people don't get the point of this story. This movie is absolutely not about the erotics. It is about 2 people finding each other and falling in love, even though they both have no idea what it's like to have a 'normal' relationship. Anastasia actually sees Christian as a person, while Christian only sees himself as a monster. <br/><br/>I do not have an opinion about any film technical aspects, simply because I do not have any knowledge about that.<br/><br/>I can highly recommend this movie. But I must say: try to get to know the characters instead of focusing on the sexual action."

But little girls and horny housewife's will love it The directing, just went all over the place. The main focus was with aesthetics, no content what so ever.<br/><br/>There are amazing love and or sex story's out there, this in not the case... now let's wait for part 2 and 3.

"mowglilp","8","424","735","13 February 2015"," I enjoyed this movie very much, I'm a guy, am I normal ?
","So my girlfriend and I were invited by a group of colleagues (all female) to see this movie. I didn't know anything about it, except the trailer and I was intrigued, I was anxious to see it. My excitement was over as soon as my (male) colleagues heard I'm going to see it. They started to laugh that I'm actually going to see such a piece of garbage, I was called both a hero and gay. I didn't think much of it until I read all the reviews on IMDb hours before seeing the movie, and that's when I started to have second thoughts about it, seeing how people reviewed this movie.<br/><br/>I'm really sorry this movie has such horrible reviews, it deserves much better. True, there's no complicated script, no fancy acting, no original lines, no adorable love story but maybe we're expecting the wrong things from this movie because it's considered as a romance and I really think it's not. It has nothing to do with romance, it is in fact about two different desires and passions and yet completely the same once you boil them down, two sides of a coin, if you will. It's about a man who has a different sexual desire than most men, who was abused as a child and is now quite proud of what he has become and sees nothing wrong with it... until he meets Anastasia, the only woman who manages to crack his fortress and even though she wants to please her master, she also wants her master to bend down to her desires and needs. Once this is clear, the movie becomes an intriguing roller-coaster of emotions, decisions, psychological struggle and compromises for both partners who both love each other and want each other and yet... can't find a common ground because none of them want to completely give in. How come the majority can't relate to that, is beyond me...<br/><br/>I will surely watch this one again, maybe I will understand why everybody is giving this movie such a bad review. One thing is pretty clear: males just don't get this movie and that's the majority, I would bet it's the same majority of men that complain all their life about how women are soooo complicated and nobody can understand them. If you ask me, if you don't get this movie, you don't get women, or a good majority of them. I read many guys writing stuff like ""do women actually go for that stuff, do they actually want to be abused and raped?"" Well, you're probably the kind of guy who thinks he's awesome in bed, has the biggest penis and his women is satisfied after every 2 minutes of humping and then falling asleep, well... that's why women enjoy this movie, but we act all shocked about it. The fact that over one hundred young women around me in the cinema were giggling at every sexual dominant scene, proves my point and it also proves that they are missing something, but I guess to you they are just dumb. There was also the biggest crowd (of around 95% young women) I ever saw queue up in front of a cinema.<br/><br/>And what's with all the hypocrisy ? you call this an anti-feminist movie after you call it's female audience dumb for watching it ? nice... You complain about the fact that it's abusive and ""oh my god, how degrading to women"", and yet... you rejoice at every action movie or thriller where a mad man is actually beating and raping or torturing women and girls ? how are those any better ? just because the focus is on the hero and how he saves the day, makes it less disturbing ? How about ""12 years a slave"" ? that wasn't abusive and degrading at all right ? no, it's an extraordinary piece of cinematography... right.<br/><br/>Finally, I don't get all these complaints that it's abusive, it promotes anti-feminism, sexual molestation and rape... how can you people come up with such ideas ? Both partners in the movie agreed and wanted it, how does that make it rape ? If Anastasia is down with it and doesn't see it as rape, who are you to tell her she's wrong to think that ? And why all the complaints about this not being BDSM ? who said it should be ? it's not a documentary, it's about the sexual desire of a young man who was abused as a child, it might be twisted in your eyes, but as long as his partner is OK with it, then it's none of your business. How exactly is it abuse and rape if Anastasia wanted it and asked for it specifically ? And you're seriously calling this a porn movie ? I have seen comedy movies with famous actors being involved in more pornographic scenes, but somehow, we think nothing wrong of those movies. By the way, have any of you ever seen a ""true"" BDSM movie ? now THAT'S abuse and twisted! This movie is like a kiss in the park compared to some of the BDSM movies out there."

The main plot in the book probably occupy 2/5 of the entire book but 2/3 in the movie. So you may know that it gets really boring. Some scenes were added obviously like the business meeting.

Yet, giving this kind of impression to the young teenagers is not okay and letting them know that if you are in love with someone you would have sex with him or her the first few times you met each other is acceptable.

","Perhaps appropriately, given its subject matter, Fifty Shades of Grey feels like two, distinct films grappling for dominance over the screen: one, a sensual and stylish romance about a young woman on a path of self-discovery, both in and out of the bedroom ‚Äì and the other, a numbingly explicit Harlequin bodice-ripper brought to life, better suited for Cinemax's late night library than the multiplex. Unfortunately, the lesser one of the pair ends up on top, no doubt due to the creative stranglehold in which author E.L. James held director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel throughout the adaptation process, meaning that viewers get to be teased and titillated ‚Äì then totally turned off (not to mention left with a severe case of blue balls, thanks to an anti-climactic ending that calls to mind an arcade game's ""Insert More Quarters"" display). In other words, Fifty Shades of Grey is a victim of behind-the-scenes drama, neither the glossy and intriguingly tragicomic tale of dangerous sexual politics Taylor-Johnson tried to make, nor the thoroughly smutty romance James clearly felt her story worked better as. Instead, tt's the limpest, most colorless hybrid of the two possible. Any true movie lover will detest James for holding a talented director back in her own little, pathetic show of dominance, though it's possible that some fans of the book may have lusted after an adaptation that, on the contrary, existed solely to allow for visualization of the author's most salacious sentences. That's for them to report. The fans already spoke once, back in the summer of 2012, turning James' novel into the fastest-selling paperback of all time, which suggests more readers share her fixation with raw sexuality than would like to admit."

I was exposed to some of the pitiful writing briefly when I rode in the car with my wife while she had on the audio book. That predisposed me to expect absolute dreck from the movie. I was greatly surprised to find myself laughing early on--not at the movie itself, but at a particular moment in it that was intended to be funny. It was drawing me in, almost against my will. As it went on, I began liking the character of Anastasia. Christian may have been a little eye-rolling here and there, but I still bought into him. I get why some people are trashing this film--partly because the source material is absolute garbage--but it's actually a pretty interesting character study. I should add that my enjoyment of the film was increased because I watched it in a crowded theater. My wife and I were older than anyone else there. The reaction of the audience to the action (yes, the ""action"") on screen was invariably entertaining, sometimes hilarious. Keep an open mind, be a bit forgiving, and enjoy."

","""Lifestyles of the Rich and Perverse"" might be a more fitting title for the unusually explicit bedroom drama.<br/><br/>This adaptation of a trilogy of novels by E.L. James -- which features a modern-day Marquis de Sade as its male protagonist -- has a pornographically narrow focus and a potentially dangerous message.<br/><br/>James, whose real name is Erika Mitchell, has apparently captured the imaginations of bored housewives everywhere by tracing the unlikely romance between socially awkward college student Anastasia and intimidating business tycoon Christian Grey.<br/><br/>The popularity -- and notoriety -- of James' fiction is such that moviegoers know from the outset that the stumbling block tripping these two up, as they attempt to tango, will be Christian's fondness for whips and chains. Thus the duo's first interaction -- which comes about when Ana agrees to fill in for her ailing roommate Kate, a journalism major, by interviewing Christian for the campus newspaper -- is loaded down with dramatic irony.<br/><br/>All Ana knows is that Christian has been tapped to deliver the commencement address at her pending graduation. But we're on to this dungeon-loving Bruce Wayne's real identity. So his sly double entendres are ever so much fun.<br/><br/>In between the zingers, Ana and Christian fall for each other. Yet, as Ana tries to bond with her aloof new beau, she's perplexed by his total lack of hearts-and-flowers romanticism. Until, that is, she discovers that he's an obsessive sadist with an elaborately equipped ""playroom"" full of pain-inducing gadgets and restraints.<br/><br/>Though it's framed in the familiar context of a good girl's crusade to redeem a naughty boy, Ana's eventual cooperation with Christian's perversion, risks conveying the idea that all women are potentially willing victims of physical abuse and humiliation. We're also left to wonder what role Christian's helicopter and fancy penthouse pad play in rendering Ana so tractable.<br/><br/>While responsible viewers might sympathize with Christian's troubled background, both in childhood and beyond, as well as with his passing acknowledgement of the harmful nature of his proclivities, the intent to stir audiences by teasing a supposed taboo is unmistakable.<br/><br/>Sadly, but essentially (at the risk of repeating) this 'fantasy' promotes all the worst things (mostly violence) on the ""person"" (esp women): ie: stalk, do harm (physically n psychologically), prostitute (money), pornography upon women .. and bring down the dignity of men anyway that's my piece... the movie is -10, but the chart doesn't have that option :-)"
"EightMinds","9","137","229","14 February 2015"," Not your average love story
","I am disappointed that so many people seem to have missed the point with this film. Some of the reviews I've read might as well say, there's not enough action in it - it's not an action film! In the same way, stop judging it on what you expected it to be. I have read all three books, and now I have watched the first film of the Fifty Shades Trilogy. It would appear that my opinion differs greatly to others on this franchise. Firstly the film - I was wary after reading so many negative reviews, however I was curious after reading the books, so my husband and I went along. I was pleasantly surprised when he said he actually enjoyed it. It would seem that many of the negative reviews of this film are based on its lack of sexual content, to which I would disagree. In the book the sex scenes got repetitive and a little dull after a while. ""Their eyes met and it wasn't long before they were in a passionate embrace...."" Oh, and everyone has climaxed. Hmm... I agreed with some of the book reviews about how astounding it was that Anastasia went from virgin to sex goddess in 3 pages. However, this annoyance was removed in the film and what you saw was a passionate encounter between two people. I was also pleased to discover that they had completely omitted the inner goddess. That was also one of the big annoyances of the book. I felt that the film was a good replication of the book, and it managed to follow the story line well, without missing out any 'key' details. There were particular cringe worthy scenes that were removed, but I really don't feel this impeded the flow of the story. There have been comments about the flow of the dialogue in the film; however I think this helped capture the relationship between Christian and Anastasia. They had a few brief encounters and then they were having sex, this isn't the makings of a long term comfortable relationship. She's young and has a lot to learn, so of course it's going to be awkward.<br/><br/>I found the books very easy to read. I read one of them in a week. There are no complex words that weigh down the mind, but the writing style is a little juvenile. That being said, I did enjoy the story. This is not your average love story, but I think it does hit on some elements that do feature in every day relationships. Some of the interactions between the characters are relatable, but people seem to forget why Christian is how he is. His troubled past gets overlooked, but it is the reason why he has such a skewed perception on relationships.<br/><br/>I found the domestic abuse claims quite shocking. I do wonder if these people have actually read the book or watched the film. I've heard people say that this is going to set women back centuries! What utter nonsense. At the end of the film, Anastasia asks Christian to show her what it's really like. The results shock her, but she stands up for herself! When he approaches her, she says no. She was trying to make a decision on whether to go through with this or not, and that helped her make her decision. The entire encounter was consensual, which is the whole point of a dom/sub relationship. <br/><br/>I've often heard people say that in those types of relationships the sub is actually the one in control. They choose to relinquish control to the dom, and they can take that back at any time.<br/><br/>I've also heard comments that the book/film puts BDSM in a bad light. The interactions in the book/film are an extreme view of this type of relationship. This is all Christian has ever known, and as he said himself, he doesn't do hearts and flowers. It is my understanding that couple who practise BDSM actually have very healthy 'normal' relationships. They sleep in the same bed, and lead normal lives, however for a portion of their day, they assume roles in the form of dom/sub, and they both enjoy partaking in the activities. <br/><br/>The events in the film are not a true depiction of a dom/sub relationship. It's one step further. However, Anastasia's strength and determination seems to be trying to bring it back into the healthy realms. Just because this type of relationship isn't your type of thing, doesn't make it wrong. <br/><br/>So I may be the only positive review on this film, but I stand by my opinions. It's a good film - it's not porn and it's not domestic abuse. It's a troubled love story. <br/><br/>And, the cliff hanger ended has opened itself up to a compulsory sequel. See you in 2016."
"morganhornung","9","73","118","16 February 2015"," Thoroughly enjoyed this movie
","Everyone completely let down this movie. It deserves way more than what people are giving it. I personally will be buying this movie when it is released. Mob psychology hit this movie real hard. Once a few people started dissing it, other people believed them and wouldn't judge it for what it actually was. This kind of story will obviously not appeal to everyone but it did for some so people need to stop ruining others fun. <br/><br/>Now, for the real review, I thought the actors were great. They had their awkward phase together because they're starting a new relationship and he has a big secret to tell. NOT because they're awkward actors. Don't tell me that in real life that wouldn't be a little awkward. They played their growing relationship parts perfectly. I actually felt like I could know these actors BECAUSE they acted so well and made it seem like everyday life and not the glitz and glam acting of all the famous actors we've put on pedestals. <br/><br/>The cinematography definitely worked for me. They made the movie come alive with the settings, lighting, and angles they used. The different scenes in themselves helped tell the story in a way words couldn't. <br/><br/>I LOVE the changes they made from the book. I'll admit that I was not a fan of the books. The story was decent but I couldn't stand the writing. The movie made way more sense and it was easier to fall in love with the characters. I wish this could've just been made a movie from the start so there wouldn't have been so much bad press already out about it. <br/><br/>I'll end now by saying I am very pleased with this movie and hope all the negativity won't prevent releases of the rest of the story. I'll be waiting eagerly to see Anastasia and Christian on screen again!"

","I sit here with my head in my hands, as i now have to relive the two hours of my life that i wasted on watching this 'film'. I don't quite know how i can put across how bad this film is. My most accurate synopsis is that if you've ever watched a porn film, there will usually be (so I'm told ;-)) a terrible ten minute build up containing terrible acting, cheesy lines, and non believable attraction between the characters...imagine that for two hours and you have Fifty Shades of Grey in a nutshell. The whole affair just seems to fade into one long boring series of encounters, with very little substance to the story, and the supposedly 'steamy' scenes are about as arousing as a flash of your school dinner ladies drawers. The lad can act but his American accent is terrible and much like the book, the script is horrendous, he should sack his agent. the female lead is attractive but again i just don't buy that she would be attracted to the male, and if the film is based upon their fascination with each other, then it leaves you wondering why the hell you're sat there...you actually don't care if they get together.<br/><br/>Its one of those films that just doesn't grab you from the start and it ultimately fails to pick up throughout, make no mistake, had it been at all possible, i would have left after 10 minutes, but i think my girlfriend (who also found it appalling), would maybe have scowled at wasting the money.<br/><br/>Ill sign off with this: WOMEN: wait for the DVD, spend the admission money on a steak for your man, he will appreciate it more. <br/><br/>MEN: At any cost, fake illness ,death,self inflicted loss of limb, get yourself out of watching this absolute dross!"

","""Fifty shades of Grey""is the most mediocre and boring film that I saw in my entire life. I was curious why it is the most expected movie of the year, but It was only marketing and It was a waste of time. At some point I even wanted to leave the cinema room. There is no chemistry between characters. It is full of ""cliche"" (the piano, the red car, the computer, the helicopter and more ....). There is also an totally anti-romantic movie, I don't understand why it was launch on Valentines Day. To bad for the director (Sam Taylor-Johnson) ""Nowhere Boy"" was a very good movie, so I was expecting more, but as somebody said with a poor script or poor book no director can do much..."

The storyline is unique-and gets big points just for that alone! First rate performances by ALL, and Dakota and Jamie indeed, drive this compelling movie into the winners circle! Listen naysayers..this movie gives the timeless PURE LOVE theme, a NEW twist..and a VERY compelling and believable one at that. Anyone that wasn't YEARNING for Anastasia and Grey to find that TRUE LOVE..needs therapy and/or to be honest. The sex was NOT used lightly, and was very tastefully done. That's the magic of this simple story. A new twist on tired themes..fresh faces and performances that make this flick one of the best for 2015. Dakota Johnson is NOW, after this movie, one of the best actresses in Hollywood. Dakota is Talented as she is beautiful-endearing and compelling as an actress can be!

","I have read the books and today saw the movie. I liked it very much. Many reviews have indicated the book/movie is degrading to women. Not so. There are hundreds of movies degrading to women. Just go watch the Wolf of Wall Street if you want to see degrading behavior. This is a romance story with some unusual sexual behavior, but hey they are consenting adults. Christian NEVER does anything Ana does not give him permission or even ask him to do...NEVER. There were a few plot points I would have liked to see in the movie, but overall they did a good job. The sex was tastefully done and not over the top by any means. The two lovers are like rabbits in the books. I was happy to see it pulled back to something more reasonable. Over 100 million books and soon to be over 100 million at the box office. People pay for a good story, so by these measures (and mine) this is a good story."

The way they interact with one another is straight off the pages of the novel! If you did not like the books then do not see the movie because you will be disappointed. The sex scenes in the movie are graphic but they cannot be compared with porn.

"Evey88","9","11","14","6 June 2015"," Loved It
","I think people who have rated this movie so horribly have no idea what BDSM is.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it. I was expecting it to be way more violent considering all of the horrible reviews. I thought the on screen interaction was great. Even though Jamie Dornan may have lacked on the intensity level, I still think he did a great job. I thought he and Dakota had great on screen chemistry. Not sure what all the fuss is about that? I have done my own research and interacted with people in the BDSM community before, so I knew a little bit going in. Just like in any relationship, there has to be boundaries. There has to be trust. No abuse should be tolerated, ever.<br/><br/>That being said, the movie did a very good job at showing her being hesitant to join the lifestyle. She didn't rush in like a bull. There was a contract in place. She was never forced into the lifestyle. It also did a great job showing her emotions when he crossed the line. That being said, I think this movie is meant for a very specific audience.<br/><br/>Was there tons of sex? Yes. Was the nudity ridiculous? Yes. Then again, what did you expect? I mean, really. People that are going to see this movie and are leaving absolutely disgusted -- you knew this movie was controversial. Did you not do research to see what it was about? I don't think that this movie encourages abuse. It's not degrading of women. Just like the BDSM lifestyle, this movie is not for everyone. Many will not like it.<br/><br/>The damage, however, that I think this movie does is spur curiosity. While some may think that's a good thing, I don't think it is. There are A LOT of predators out there that use BDSM to abuse others. You have to tread EXTREMELY carefully if you ever want to get involved in the lifestyle. I think this is going to cause a lot of young people to want to explore things, and be to trusty of strangers. There are people out there that respectfully do BDSM the right way and are respectful of their partners, and it is completely consensual and pleasurable both ways. The fakes that try to use BDSM to abuse others are the ones that you have to watch out for.<br/><br/>Anyway, I loved the movie. I thought it was great. I cried through a lot of it. It really did a great job stirring emotions and creating an attachment between you and the characters. I'm really looking forward to the sequel :-)."
"romneyranjo","7","11","14","7 March 2015"," Contrast to what the haters are saying, I actually find this film OKAY.
","I saw this film last month and to be honest, i actually liked it. I mean first and foremost you have to know that the book itself isn't really good so you shouldn't really expect a lot from the film.<br/><br/>I've read the book and comparing it to its film adaption, I can say that the film's way better. They made it LESS about the s*x and MORE about the ""romantic"" love story of Grey and Steele. Also, they gave Steele's character some humor which for me was such an important element. <br/><br/>In terms of technicalities, the film wasn't ""over-the-edge"" it's okay. Nothing special. <br/><br/>In terms of soundtrack, the film has superb songs! It' actually sets up the mood quite well. I cried a bit when Ellie Goulding's ""Love Me Like You Do"" started playing. Weird right?<br/><br/>In terms of acting, Dakota did an okay job. She started a bit off (her character was supposed to be awkward-cute, but she made her seem awkward in a bad way). Jamie's portrayal of Grey on the other hand was less than okay. He pulled of the sexy and ""let's f*ck"" part but the INTIMIDATING part not quite well. The way he talked also distracted me i don't know why.<br/><br/>All in all, I think the film's still worth watching and is not as bad as to what people/haters are saying. I'm actually giving it a 6- 7 over 10 grade."

Jamie Dornan is so sexy OMG, that eyes on the big screen are like a sea.... I'm giving a rate 6/10 because it was nice to watch but not so perfect. Yet, this 4/10 rate is a little bit confusing.

","OK, I saw the movie first. SHOCKING!!! Over a million people have read this book. Well I decided I wanted to do this my way and see the movie first then read the book. Did I know about some of the story? YES! Of course there are differences from the book and movie. But if they did the book exactly as we read it, this movie would have been 4hrs long. Now, I enjoyed both. I did enjoy the movie version of Ana more. They gave her some strength and also showed a silly side. The integrity of the book holds. Did I have a few issues? Of course. I did take issue of him not sleeping with Ana when in the book he had slept with her more then once. Also the fact that he was talking to a sleeping Ana about his past. Well why not tell her when she is awake. Those were the least of my issues for the movie. I already pre-ordered this.<br/><br/>Now, we all know that the second book, Fifty Shades Darker is in the works. I am PRAYING that the author does not try to put all her power behind the story and drag this out. We know what needs to be in the movie. What is important. All we can now do is wait."
"when-dinosaurs-roam","8","9","11","1 March 2015"," Honest
","Here is an honest review from someone who couldn't get past the books. I've read a majority of the first book, but couldn't reach the end, since I was too disgusted. To put it simply, I'm not a fan of E.L. James or her writing style.<br/><br/>That being said, I did not have high expectations. My mother wanted to see this film, so I decided to treat her, and we went out to go see it in IMAX, no less.<br/><br/>Honestly¬Ö it was convincing. I ended up liking it a lot and this is coming from me, someone who desperately wanted to hate it, because I hated what I had read. It was a pleasant surprise and I'd see it again should the occasion present itself.<br/><br/>The sex scenes were tasteful, dialogue bearable, and the storytelling made their relationship feasible.<br/><br/>I would be more interested in the books, if the film writer responsible had originally written them, since they had skillfully left out what I deemed as nonsense. Sorry, it's just my opinion.<br/><br/>It's easier to hate on something, than to love it. It's easier to be funny by mocking something. It's more interesting to read about someone's hate, than love.<br/><br/>Although I'm not a fan, it's unfair to antagonize others for what they enjoy."

"sarahcargius","7","64","105","14 February 2015"," Not perfect but does not deserve to be vilified
","As a fan of the books, I have been looking forward to this film for a while. Yes, the books are flawed, God forbid anyone should be allowed to enjoy a book that is easy to read, about a gorgeous, unattainable, flawed Billionaire and a seemingly submissive brunette who manages to tame him. Forget the sex, it is repetitive. Every woman wants to be the woman who changes a man & makes him settle down. So the film...well maybe my hopes were too high. However, Johnson & Dornan do have chemistry. It's funny, perhaps even when it shouldn't have been, but there is an element of comedy to the book, so thumbs up on that one. The problem lies with the lack of detail. The first book is thin on plot really. It's all about will she sign the contract? No? How about a weeks free trial of life as a Christian Grey Submissive? Hmmm, yes please! Now will you sign? Er no. The End. The book is written from Ana's point of view & is composed of a lot of her inner monologue, which may not have won the book critics over, but is essential to the plot. This isn't in the film & it suffers for it. It's too rushed & unless you have read the books or are really easily pleased, you'll struggle to root for this relationship, as you can't quite see why she fancies him (despite the obvious), let alone falls in love with him. It needed another half an hour to put some important parts in from the book. Where was the interview with Jack Hyde, setting the scene for Film 2? Where was a proper meal with Christian ordering her to eat; we needed to see more of his issues. The belt scene was great but the ending, which nearly made me shed a tear in the book, was cut short with barely a whimper from the leads or the audience. More sex scenes wouldn't have been beneficial, it's a LOVE story, not a porno flick. Dornan seemed uncomfortable with some of the more 'honest' statements Christian declares: ""I don't make love, I f**k hard"" If you look carefully, you can see him cringing, as was I. In the book, it's quite hot. In reality...well perhaps some things are better left in between the covers of the book. If you love the book, you'll enjoy the film. I wish I had read no reviews prior to seeing it, as I feel I went into the cinema looking to pick holes. I will go back and see it again, more relaxed & knowing what to expect. It doesn't deserve the slamming it's getting from critics. Dornan is a talent & Johnson is exactly the Anastasia I imagined. It's too long a book for every detail to be included and that's always going to be a problem with book adaptations, but vital plots & character depictions were left out. The next film script needs serious consideration. Less art, more true to the book. It's a romance with kinky sex, not an abusive relationship. Christian may be rich and experienced, but Ana has the power in this relationship. Those who say otherwise, do not 'get' this series & would be well advised to steer clear."

I thought I'd give them a chance to spruce up the books a bit, but that did not happen. I was bored after about 30 minutes into it and thought of leaving halfway through. <br/><br/>The acting was OK, but then again both stars worked with what they were given...which was not a lot of dialogue to start with. I wouldn't hang my hat on either of them. The set design was good for the most part and stayed close to the books as far as colors and layout. Other than that, there's really not a lot of positive review for this. It felt like I was watching a bad soap opera."

","Besides being full of clich√©s, I find this film to be sexist and encouraging of prostitution. If it were just a movie about BDSM I would of been OK with it, if it were just a romantic move I would of been OK with it. But promoting this poor girl - rich boy romantic story is getting really old, really fast. As a society we are starting to realize the damaging effects stories like Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast have upon our kids ideals and their ambitions in life. This film is nothing but worse. Cinderella goes for Prince Charming, the Beauty goes for the Beast with Money, and the female protagonist of this film goes for a rich man that would also like to whip her from time to time. What's next? - I don't even want to imagine."

","I think this movie has been greatly misunderstood. I absolutely loved this movie! I enjoyed the book, but like many thought it was very badly written and the whole 'inner goddess' think kind of ruined the story. Besides that, I wasn't a fan of Anastasia, but I rarely like the main character in a book. I think the movie is the best possible version of the book. The director did a great job - eliminating all the annoying stuff from the book and turning it into a fantastic love story with just the right amount of sex to spice it up. I believe there is no other movie like this out there and I'm sure I'll watch it many more times in the future. I agree that the acting was bad at times, but I loved Dakota Johnson overall - she actually made me like Anastasia. I was very disappointed at first when I heard Charlie Hunnam was replaced by Jamie Dornan, but I was pleasantly surprised by him. He might be a bit 'goofy' at times, and not dangerous enough to play Christian Grey, but I still think he added just enough 'darkness' to his character - in particular in the final scene which I thought was incredible. Yes - you could argue that the movie is controversial in terms of abuse, although it was consensual,(I disagree completely with rape - Ana was never raped) but it's a work of fiction and if you've read the books, you know the dynamics are going to change.<br/><br/>Overall I loved the movie and am disappointed by all the negative reviews. Nevertheless - I will still enjoy watching it over and over again :-)"
"spikemaze","10","15","21","3 March 2015"," People hate it because of the hype
","This movie is really not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Many voters haven't even seen it and others have hated it before they saw it.<br/><br/>I was so focused on the book the first time I saw it that I didn't really appreciate the movie for what it was. Then a friend dragged me in for a second viewing and I knew what to expect. I was very surprised because it wasn't as bad as I thought the first time.<br/><br/>No, it is not a masterpiece. And it's missing many scenes from the book - a book that was terribly written and originally was a Twilight fanfic (which still pains me),but had a good story. This is the story, they should focus on.<br/><br/>The sex scenes were not necessary to that extent and they should have cut it short. <br/><br/>Dakota Johnson was not my favorite choice for Ana Steele. She's not tiny enough. But I found her actually very fun and quite good. <br/><br/>Jamie Dornan was a good Christian for me, though many do not agree. A few times his accent slipped, but other than that he did a very good job. Sadly the script didn't give Jamie and Dakota much room to explore their roles. It was too shallow so I applaud them for doing it so well.<br/><br/>But a few casting choices were not so good. Elliot was not a sweet, hot lady killer, but looked more like a creepy drug dealer. Kate was not gorgeous enough and Grace (Christians mom) was too young.<br/><br/>All the criticism for being anti feminism is something I don't understand. We start out with seeing a girl who doesn't have any self-esteem and lets everyone walk all over her. Then she meets a man who gives her confidence to stand up for herself. She finds her own inner strength. Also, there's no rape between Ana and Christian, not in the movie nor the book.<br/><br/>Many from the BDSM community complains that the book makes it seem that you can only be into BDSM if you have psychological problems. It isn't true. Ana discovers that she likes it too and that 'it isn't the how that was wrong. It was the why'. There's nothing wrong with liking BDSM, but it is wrong if you do it to punish and work out your personal problems. <br/><br/>I think it's sad that the movie has such a bad rating on IMDb because it's not terrible. Many horrible movies have better ratings so it's obviously because of the hype that many don't like the movie (or the books for that matter).<br/><br/>Go watch the movie without expectations. You'd be surprised."

In fact, the only complaint I've heard from friends is that they wish Christian had been portrayed by someone else (but reality can never beat our own imagination!). Some of the scenes were combined from the book while others followed the book religiously so it ran smoothly. I was happy to see that the sex scenes were well made without breaking the boundaries of decency. I understand that some people did not enjoy the movie (some never feel that a movie can encompass a book properly), but I don't understand how someone who dislikes a book tremendously can then go see the movie and call it bad!

","Seldom has an R-rated movie arrived in theaters with more pre-release hype, anticipation ‚Äì and misunderstanding ‚Äì than ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" (R, 2:05).

Nevertheless, the nudity, sex, and eroticism are on full display throughout the movie. This film, the book on which it is based, and this review are not for the faint-of-heart or the easily offended.<br/><br/>Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson, daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson) is an attractive and intelligent college senior in Washington State who fills in for her sick roommate, Kate (Eloise Mumford) in interviewing billionaire business magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for the college newspaper. Anastasia (Ana to her friends, except to Christian, who consistently uses her full first name) gets flustered in the presence of this young, sophisticated, supremely-confident and mysterious man. For his part, Christian is quite taken with Ana ‚Äì and take her is what he soon decides he wants to do. He shows up at the hardware store where she works, takes her out to coffee and even comes to ""rescue"" her when she drunk dials him from a bar. Despite how obvious it is to the main characters and to the audience that these two are very, very different ‚Äì and despite the title character's own conflicted resistance ‚Äì these two twenty-somethings cannot resist each other.<br/><br/>In most love stories, after setting up the situation like I did in that last paragraph, I'd say ""romance blooms"" (or something to that effect), but Christian very clearly states, ""I don't do romance."" That doesn't stop Ana from being drawn to this man and wondering about the ""various physical pursuits"" he says he likes and his ""singular"" tastes, as he describes them. As Ana discovers more about the cipher that is Christian, she learns that he is wounded ‚Äì both emotionally and physically ‚Äì by his childhood. She seems to want to comfort this man who acts as if he needs no comforting and begins to love this man who tells her that he is only interested in her for sex.<br/><br/>Being the woman in Christian Grey's life means submitting completely ‚Äì sexually and otherwise ‚Äì to his whims. As he eases her towards an understanding and acceptance of his lifestyle, she has to sign a non-disclosure agreement, he convinces her to have sex (actually ""f--- hard"", as he describes it) and then shows her his ""playroom."" This usually locked room is painted dark red, has a bed and is filled with various restraining devices and implements of sadomasochistic sex play. Ana is shocked, but not necessarily repulsed. She's¬Ö curious.<br/><br/>Christian presents her his thick contract which describes Ana's prospective role as his submissive. He urges her to read the contract, educate herself on being a submissive and ""keep an open mind."" She does all that, while Christian waits impatiently for Ana to make a decision. What follows is a complicated dance in which both parties kid themselves about how it's going. He seems confident that she's warming to the idea of being his sex slave and she is convincing herself that he is becoming boyfriend material. Ana does draw closer to Christian's world in fits and starts and Christian seems to be working harder to draw Ana in than he has probably ever worked before. No spoilers here, but eventually the true nature of each character does come out and the film ends with two words that carry more emotion than any six syllables I can remember hearing in any movie in a very long time.<br/><br/>A given audience member's reaction to this movie will likely be influenced by how she or he feels about Christian's lifestyle, but evaluating this film solely on those criteria misses the point. Yes, the nudity and sex are enticing and anyone paying to see this movie for those scenes will be more than satisfied, but you'll get more than eroticism for your money. Much like ""Boogie Nights"", director Paul Thomas Anderson's engrossing 1997 meditation on the 70s porn industry, this film is an examination of human relationships. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is a love story, a parable of male and female emotional and sexual roles in the 21st century and an exploration of a lifestyle which many people know very little about, but very few know much. Basically, this is simply an entertaining movie. Casting little-known actors in the main roles is very effective and both show more emotional range than I expected from simply watching the movie's theatrical trailer. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson paces the movie well and she skillfully balances the film's salacious nature with its deeper meanings. ""B+"""

You are watching real violence, a real young women feeling really ashamed being humiliated not simply in a private room but in front of cameramen and film crew. Dakota Johnson herself said in several interviews that she hopes that nobody ever watches the movie. ""I don't want my family to see it, because it's inappropriate.

"Robert_duder","7","8","10","4 March 2015"," For all the endless non-stop drivel about this film and its content....its really nothing
","I had really no desire to see this. I'm a mid-30's married male and my wife hated 50 Shades (didn't even finish the first book) and she has no desire to see the movie either. I am a huge movie buff and I write reviews so for some unknown reason I felt compelled to watch this. So I did. First of all...its not that bad. It is mostly entertaining in some sort of bizarre romance sort of way. Parts of the film are so campy that its laughable but could it be any other way? The film is anything but offensive. Does it have nudity? Yes. Does it have sex scene? Yes. Is it absurdly X-Rated and shocking? No, not even close. Its completely an adult movie don't get me wrong but there were far more shocking films in the 80's and 90's with the ""baby blue"" films as they were once known. The bondage is fairly tame when you think about what they could have done and what it sounds like the book is like. The film is mindless drivel but its not horrible mindless drivel, its entertaining enough and I could see some people getting a kick out of it. Its being taken far too seriously and the protesters should be mindful that the more they fight back, the more people are going to be intrigued by it.<br/><br/>The casting is hard to explain. The constant barrage of negative comments against the two leads is not undeserved. They aren't good. In fact in the first half hour or so of the film they are no better than a B-Movie disaster flick. They are horrendous. Then they sort of grow on you in some sort of bizarre silly laughable way. I do have to disagree with many, many critics that they have no chemistry though. I think they do have some chemistry. It isn't amazing but it isn't bad either. In fact the film is made just a little better because they do sort of seem bizarrely connected. Dakota Johnson is insatiably adorable but she is also not a great strong female lead. The character of Anastasia probably sets back women's liberation by fifty years but that's not for me to debate. Johnson grows on you because she is so cute and spunky and a fish out of water so I think she fulfilled the part well enough. Jamie Dornan might be exactly what this character calls for. He seems almost monotone and stoic and bland at times, almost robotic, but is that the point? There is a whole controversy about him being emotionally messed up as to why he loves BDSM and if you want to discuss that...go for it but let's be honest, this is soft core porn not brilliant film making or literary genius. At least they try to make him a complex character. The supporting cast are all decent with no real stand out performers but they do okay. Anastasia's mother, Jennifer Ehle does a solid job as does Christian's mother played by Marcia Gay Harden.<br/><br/>I'm more than a little surprised that they gave the reigns of this film to a film maker with very little experience. I think it was wise of them to choose a woman as a director but I also have to give Sam Taylor-Johnson some credit because honestly the best part of this film is the directing. The script and cast and content might be more than a little campy and silly but the cinematography of the film, the bleak and grey city-scapes, flying over the countryside, the lavish offices....all are done with a great amount of artistic style. I also really actually enjoyed the soundtrack with various covers of classic songs both modern and older with some instrumental music that suited the tone of the film. The fact is that the film is not a disaster. It is absolutely NOT for everyone and if you're looking for a safe and simple romance, this isn't it but the romance isn't bad and the bondage takes a back seat to the character relationship. I would almost say (as ridiculous as it sounds) that the sex scenes just get in the way of what could have been otherwise a simple and campy little romance story. If you're against this movie, take my advice...IGNORE IT! The more people talk about it, the more it'll make. Otherwise just take it for what it is. Its hardly the worst thing I've ever seen. 7/10"

There are so many haters out there making this movie/book seem way worse than it is. The only disappointing thing is that there are many parts from the book that don't make it in to the movie but of course they can't include everything. Dakota Johnson is a great actress and Jamie is the perfect person to play Grey. The Fifty Shades trilogy is a unique love story. For people who don't agree with the BDSM lifestyle I understand but perhaps you should actually read the books or stop being so judgemental. This movie is hot and not a waste of money. If you are very against BDSM then this probably isn't the movie for you. This movie actually has a lot of comedy and its much lighter than the actual book. I personally cannot wait for the next two movies and hope they include more from the books in the next ones."

","After reading all these ridiculous reviews on here i had to post one of my own. Firstly, as a woman who is completely comfortable with myself and who has previously been in an abusive relationship, i can categorically state that this film does not in any way demoralise women and does not at any time promote rape. Ana does these things because she wants to!Do any of you people know what rape is? Secondly, if you read the book and enjoyed it, i don't see how you can't like the film. Sam Taylor-Johnson has done a brilliant job of making the film classy and not in any way gratuitous. Lastly the acting was in my opinion excellent, i thought Dakota Johnson played Ana exactly how she was described in the book with just the right amount of shyness and inquisitiveness. As for Jamie i now can't imagine anyone else playing Christian, the chemistry was also apparent throughout (not sure where people are coming from with that). I think this film is receiving some harsh criticism and for what? It's true to the book, if you don't like the book don't see it!"

In these cases it is only after the end (and only if I got interested) that I go check about the authors, the reviews and so on¬Ö<br/><br/>The present flick was one of those. And after watching the movie (which I found interesting) I went on IMDb and found that pages and pages in the review section were filled by angry or disgusted people who rated the movie 1! I'm talking about more than 1.000 reviews (no joke) which is without any doubt the reaction of scandalized souls. And this is the first interesting thing. <br/><br/>The second is that all the authors were female (E.L. James who wrote the novel, Kelly Marcel who adapted it and Samantha Taylor-Johnson who directed it). And all of them already gave proof to be fine artists (and the present movie was not bad at all in its script, acting or direction). So, much of the criticism should be re-examined with a cooler mind.<br/><br/>Finally, although this surely is an unrealistic film with unrealistic characters, it is essentially a love story and characters' unrealism is not significantly different from that of Oliver Barrett IV and Jennifer Cavalleri (remember Love Story?).

The books (which I have not read) were not aimed at me, and neither is this film. Nevertheless, I will approach it as objectively as I can.<br/><br/>The reproductive urge and underlying sex drive is a major motivation in the animal kingdom, not least for humans. Being blessed (or cursed) with rational thought, humans can cross-pollinate their sex drives with all sorts of extraneous elements: societal taboos, personal moralities, fetishes, perversions and the like. It is undeniable that the book from which this film derives tapped into something which made it a phenomenon in a particular niche market (primarily respectable whitebread middle class women). I suggest that it tapped into some sort of vicarious wish-fulfilment area, giving the frisson of the sexual deviation/s depicted without the actual risk or pain involved.<br/><br/>This is a difficult thing to convey in a film, especially one which finds itself hidebound by the practical problems which face this movie. On one hand, it knows that it is intended to appeal to the niche market which purchased the book in truckloads. On the other, it desperately wants to have mass-market appeal. Despite the film's undeniable glossy coating, this latter quest is tied together at the ankles by the fact that making a romance predicated on tieing someone up and hitting them very hard is fundamentally unappealing unless you are already converted to that particular cause. The camera slowly makes its way down naked bodies in sensuous close-up ‚Äì very nice - following which there is a bit of bondage and a bit of flagellation, and I go ""OK, you just lost me."" There seems to be far more time devoted to the rules, non-disclosure agreements and contracts involved with Christian's little foible than on the little foible itself. And there is an interesting story to be told about two people, each of whom is intent on changing the other against their will, a story touched on but not explored.<br/><br/>Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan look very attractive both in and out of their clothing, and they both work hard, but I didn't find either character very believable, and the relationship between them even less so. Miss Johnson has a dusting of pubic hair which the camera constantly shies away from for some reason, and Mr Dornan's todger is, famously, not on display. For a film which depends for its appeal on sexually frank subject matter, it is astonishingly coy about it and, consequently, not very convincing. Above everything else, it is hugely unerotic.<br/><br/>There is a saying in the north of England ‚Äì ""Neither nowt nor summat"" (translates as ""Neither nothing nor something."") Fifty Shades Of Grey is a prime example of what that expression means."

","I have read all 3 of the fifty shades of grey books and was excited to watch the film, however when i started reading the negative reviews i started to have my doubts as whether i should bother. Luckily i decided to go with my boyfriend and i was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I thought overall the storyline was much like that of the book, yes the sex scenes weren't as raunchy as some in the book but i think putting the scenes in the film would have basically made the film look cheap and tacky.<br/><br/>Everyone who is complaining about the film not being raunchy enough then to be honest just watch porn, the movie isn't just about sex its about how two people begin to slowly grow feelings for each other and the challenges they face such as christians inability to show love and how he seems to always guard his feelings due to his tortured past.<br/><br/>The acting of jamie and dakota was good, yes it isn't Oscar worthy but it made the characters believable and you started to care about them and as the film went on you could see the chemistry growing between them.<br/><br/>In my review i didn't want to give too much away, but don't just read the bad reviews and not see the film give the film a chance. Even my boyfriend (who i had to practically drag to the film) admitted that the film was good, so please give it a chance and i cant wait for the sequel"

","First of all, I've always believed that I was more of a ""review reader"" rather than a ""review writer"" but this movie got me so frustrated and so angry that I felt I needed to write my review. I wanna begin with Danny Elfman score on this film. If you wanna make an erotic movie the smartest thing to do is to put erotic and sensual music. But this movie made me feel like I was watching an episode of Desperate Housewives. This movie sure picked a fantasy score when It should have been better with a more dark twist like the way Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross do with films. Second of all, I can't begin to imagine how insulted the BDSM community must feel about the film. This thing called film was wrong about the whole idea of BDSM and turned it into a romantic high school movie. This idea of BDSM in this film is unsafe and totally erroneous. Then, let's go to the acting. I had higher expectations on the acting. Watching Jamie try to do an American accent was dreadful, watching him try to make a dark Christian Grey was painful. Dakota is a sexy woman rather than a awkward girl described in the book. Every time Dakota bites her lip, made me feel like I was watching Angelina Jolie trying to be naive and awkward, this poor intent of awkwardness was idiotic. Lets go to the horrible pick it was to put ""One line-One scene"" Rita Ora and Luke Grimmes in this film. The only reason Im giving a 2 out of 10 is because of the Soundtrack. This movie was a complete waste of time. I got bored in the cinema and decided to stay the whole time because I already paid for it."

Displaying the right amount of naivety and sexual adventure you would expect from a 20 something woman beginning to explore her sexuality. She portray's her struggle of wanting to be with Christian, without becoming his submissive, exceptionally well. You really feel her pain during the ending scenes of the film, I was really surprised by how moved I was!<br/><br/>Jamie Dornan has proved to be fantastic in this role. His expressions speak volumes and he emanates the dark, moody Christian brilliantly. You can see his confusion around Ana and his internal struggles. He oozes sex appeal and showed tremendous chemistry with Dakota. Christian is very complex character and Jamie nailed it for me. He looks smokin' hot in his blue jeans hung low on his hips!! :-)"

","The version I saw was via a pirate copy marked ""CENSORED"" which probably means most of the explicit shots in the sex scenes have been cut out . . I thought I had to mention this due to covering my back . Apparently a lot of people have been watching this film for the dubious and much hyped reason that this film is supposed to be the greatest aphrodisiac ever recorded in human history . Indeed I almost fell out of my seat reading a report in the Scottish Daily Record that a woman in her thirties had been arrested in a Glasgow cinema for ""pleasuring herself"" ! Hold your horses guys because the paper didn't print a photo of the woman in question due to sub-judicial law so hoping she's going to pop back to the cinema for a repeat performance while she sits beside you is a little bit premature , she could have been a Gorgon for all we know . But I suppose 50 SHADES has something in its favour if audience members are going to risk 5 years on the sex offenders register watching it in public . I do hope the uncensored sex scenes are worth it because if the censored version is anything to go by that woman in the Glasgow cinema might have been pleasuring herself in order to stay awake <br/><br/>The story itself is very one note . Unconfident virgin undergraduate Ana Steele embarks on a sexual relationship with 27 year old multi-billionaire Christian Grey . There's some strange casting going on here . Dakota Johnson as Ana really overplays the shy innocent virgin routine in the early part of the film and Jamie Doran never convinces as Grey . ""I don't do romance and I'm singular"" states Grey . How about ""I don't do acting and I have a single expression on my face throughout the entire movie"" Jamie ? Maybe if Grey was played by someone like a younger Christian Bale who can do a convincing turn as a manly Byronic anti-hero which is the casting that Grey calls for . The characters as played here just do not convince but to be fair to Johnson and Doran it's every aspect of the entire film that's the problem . It's directed by Sam Taylor Johnson who gives the entire mis en scene the look of a TVM on the Hallmark Channel complete with irritating incidental muzak playing over scenes . The source novel is probably complete garbage and if it is screenwriter Kelly Marcel hasn't improved it . Take this brief snippet of dialogue as Grey is just about introduce Ana to his S&M den <br/><br/>""This is my playroom"" states Grey <br/><br/>""You have an X-box in there ?"" Ana asks in all seriousness <br/><br/>I know she's supposed to be an innocent virgin but would any young woman be that na√Øve ? My shopping list has as much chance for being nominated for an Oscar as this film does .

I've read far better executed fan fictions with more passion and emotions than this essentially 'GREY' book. <br/><br/>But still went and watched the film and honestly out of all the Fifty Shades of Grey franchise the trailer was the best.

"madeyjan","8","36","62","13 February 2015"," A real, honest review from an open-minded viewer.
","Here's my 100% honest review of FSOG, coming from a book fan and an open-minded viewer.<br/><br/>Sam Taylor-Johnson's directing of the film was exquisitely done. The angles were perfect and she knows exactly how to create a sensual vibe for the audience. The close-up of Christian's fingers drumming against the desk was a perfect touch, as was every other little moment added in to the movie. Especially, I loved the elevator doors closing between Anastasia and Christian, as shown in the trailer as well. Everything looked beautiful, so for direction I definitely rate a 10/10. <br/><br/>Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan were magnificent choices for the roles of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. Although a lot of people seem to think this, I don't believe Dakota outshone Jamie in any way. Their delivery of each line was almost perfect, though there were a few awkward moments, but I would blame the script for that. Dakota portrayed Ana beautifully- she has the right look, that perfect lip bite and she knew exactly how to act stubborn. As for Jamie, I believe that the role of Christian Grey was made for him. He knows exactly how to play a dominant, right from the delivery of his lines to his actions to his facial expressions. Every little detail was just so Christian, and I loved that. However, he seemed to be a little more awkward than intimidating in the beginning. Of course, I saw more positives as the film continued, so this wasn't a problem in the end. All the supporting actors and actresses played their parts well, too. I thought Eloise Mumford was a perfect choice for Kate, as she absolutely nailed the role. I can't say much for Elliot and Mia Grey, as we didn't see much of them, but they seemed to be good choices for their roles. A stand-out actress for me is definitely Jennifer Ehle, who played Anastasia's mother Carla. My my, she did a fantastic job. Every line was delivered perfectly, she seemed to really become her character and it was brilliant. Overall, for the acting and casting, I'll give an 8/10. <br/><br/>The script. This is where I was a bit unsure. Some of the lines, for example Anastasia's 'why am I here, Christian?' and Christian's 'we don't have 24 hours!' felt very awkward and forced. A lot of dialogue in the book was very, very corny, and even as a huge fan, I can't deny that. I suppose hearing those lines spoken out loud on the big-screen just didn't look or sound right to me. For the script, i'm rating a 6/10. <br/><br/>Finally, the sex scenes. I felt like I should give a separate section for this, just because it's a defining part of this movie. I know a lot of people were unhappy with the sex scenes, but honestly, they were exactly what I expected and more. Dakota Johnson's moans were perfect. They showed just the right amount of skin. The music played in those scenes was both beautiful and sensual. Every scene left the audience wanting more. I believe they should have included a bit more- for example, some of Anastasia's naughty moments from the book would have fit well into the movie, to show the audience of her sexual growth throughout the film. overall, I'm rating the sex scenes a 9/10. <br/><br/>Finally, I'll average my score. Apologies for this being so long, I just felt I should share all my thoughts about each aspect of the movie to help those who are keen to see it. Averaged, my score is 8.25, but I'll round it to an 8/10. Again, apologies for the length!"

Jamie and Dakota have a palpable connection, despite other negative reviews (another reason why I was doubting this movie), cinematography was great, and over all this movie was if not completely then very close to what I was expecting after reading the books. Right after leaving the movie theater I wanted to go back and watch it again, it leaves you wanting to know more about Christian Grey, even when you've already read the books.

","If you like good movies, then this is not for you. If you like movies that are so bad they are good, then this is not for you. This movie is bad. Plain and simple. I've never read the book, nor do I have any intention to ever in my life especially after this movie whom some have even said was better than the book, which means the book is horrible. I know fangirls will strongly disagree and praise the movie regardless of how terrible it is though. It's almost like people who love this movie have never had sex and seeing such badly acted love/bondage scenes on-screen makes their ovaries burst. I have seriously seen bad porn with better acting and plot development than this. Seriously. I'm not just bashing this movie to go along with the masses, it truly is an unbelievably horrible movie. The leads were just bad and not even that sexually appealing. The directing was decent, but that doesn't save the movie from its horrible script and terrible delivery. Even Martin Scorsesse couldn't turn such a horrible book into a good movie. Sadly, this movie is critic proof. No matter how horrible and honest the reviews are, the fangirls and tweens will stampede to the theater and turn this into a franchise that will probably mean the final book will get a two part movie. I love sex. I love freaky sex with a freaky sexy woman. I love porn on occasion. Aside from a sexy woman, this movie combines all of those elements in the worst way. I do give kudos to James Dornan not for his horrible acting, but his decision to join the cast. The movie may be horrendous, but you cant deny that he will become a sex symbol because of it. I give it 1 star plus 1 bonus star because one up side is that women will appreciate men in suits a lot more after this. Not that they don't already."
"trublu215","4","102","201","10 February 2015"," While Johnson and Dorman light up the screen, but the film falters behind the scenes.
","50 Shades of Grey has now reached classic status among women who marvel over this book and while I don't quite get why, I respect the hell out of EL James and applaud her for her ability to make something so daring and racy. However, now that it has now jumped from the page to the screen it has something to it that keeps you watching but ultimately leaves you befuddled about what it is truly about. Objectification, vanity, feminism, masochistic sexual urges, these are all themes this film plays with but just can't seem to pinpoint an exact one it wants to stick with. The screenplay for this is a muddled piece of writing that lazily skates through its near two hour runtime with looks from Grey to Ana and no real dialog that is clever or even remotely interesting. The performances in this film are what keeps you watching. Jamie Dorman and Dakota Johnson are electrifying as Christian Grey and Ana, the two of them definitely took their jobs seriously here both physically and mentally and it absolutely pays off as much as it can considering the script they were working with. There's not a false note with their portrayals here but it does seem hard to judge when so much of the film relies on glares and one word answers. While Kelly Marcel tries to make the fans happy, it ends up hurting the film's chances of actually being good because there's just so much to say here regarding the characters and she ends up not saying anything, leaving us craving more of a connection with the characters that just simply wasn't done very well. One thing that is focused on more so than anything else are the sex scenes. They're intense, realistic and very personal and they remain the highlight of the film considering we learn the most about the characters when they're having an orgasm. There's only so much you can put into a movie especially if the source material is as sordid as this but Sam Taylor-Johnson doesn't disappoint when showing you the savage sexual nature of the infamous Christian Grey. These sex scenes push the boundaries of its R rating and fans of the book should be happy to hear that they can finally visualize some of the titillating details James seems to love to describe in her book. Despite the sex scenes being very well done and carefully filmed, the rest of the scenes feel lacking. Dorman and Johnson are screaming for a better script, its a real shame that Sam Taylor-Johnson and Kelly Marcel are seemingly asleep behind the wheel. Overall, 50 Shades of Grey is very well done in its look and feel but beneath the surface of it all, there isn't much going on outside its sex scenes."

I think that there was enough sex and it would be boring if there was more. After all, this is a movie not an adult video. It is for sure not very erotic but do not forget that these people are not porn stars. The acting was decent and the story was not super predictable. I think Jamie Dornan was a good choice. He has that caring killer look. I don't know how to explain it differently. I enjoyed it although I could also take it if it was a bit creepier.

","The book seemed to appeal to women who, until they read 50sog, had never in their repressed lives read erotic literature but, because it ended up on a best seller list, now had societally sanctioned permission to do so. This might account for its popularity. After all, if you have no basis for comparison, you might think this is how erotic literature is written. Sad.<br/><br/>Sadder still is that the film is only marginally better by virtue of its producers hiring professionals who have tried to turn a sow's ear into a silk purse. Not possible. My guess is that the same women who needed dispensation to read a racy book, now have the same go-ahead for a racy movie.<br/><br/>Last, but certainly not least, the franchise touts domestic violence as love while simultaneously misrepresenting the BDSM community. I hope for the actors' sakes, that they make enough money to live off of for the rest of their lives because this movie will haunt their careers.<br/><br/>As for E.L.

In all honesty had I not left my car parked at the restaurant I would have walked out of the theater within 20 minutes of the movie starting. This movie came down to me as a poor attempt at producing an instructional BDSM porn video for teenagers. Quite frankly I don't understand why every other comment here references horny, middle aged and over weight housewives. I'm far from that, very satisfied in that department; but what I was really hoping for was a reason to dig into the book. And without any doubt in my mind this movie gave me every reason to say NO!

This was never going to be an Oscar worthy film. The book was not a literary gem. I was actually surprised to see that they seemed to give Ana a bit more of a spine which, helped the movie to not just feature her crying from start to finish and, added a little humor at times. They were also able to incorporate lots of little details for the readers that will pick up on the conversations or inner dialog that happened in the book but, just show up as details in the film. Overall, as rumored the film lacks some chemistry but not so much that it is painful. The cheesy dialog was there at times but, it was straight from the cheesy book so no surprises there.

","There has been a lot of fascination of the 50 shades series amongst women. I have never read the books but wanted to see what all the fuss was about. After seeing the film last night I am utterly repulsed that this film was even allowed to be shown. We have come so far giving women equal rights and there is a constant fight to allow women to be given equal opportunities however this film goes against all of this. Grey is allowed to control, manipulate whilst physically and emotionally abusing Anna. Even allowing to dictate her food and drink consumption. She even has to sign a contract allowing Grey to do anything he was wants to her and if she does not abide by these rules he is allowed to punish her by hitting her. Is this the message we want to be sending to young girls? It gives the green light to allowing someone to control, manipulate and hit you. How is that pleasurable or acceptable on any level. This film glamorises domestic abuse and should never have been allowed to be shown. Not only is the plot ridiculous it is also very low budget as the main bulk of the film is filmed in about 3/4 rooms. The acting is equally as poor. It makes me very sad that women are being 'turned on' by this film and are encouraging this behaviour. Maybe if Mr Grey wasn't a billionaire and wasn't so handsome there would not be this same attraction and acceptance."

"martinramos1996","1","37","67","13 February 2015"," Very Bad
","This can be considered one of the worst movies of the century... 50 Shades of Grey is filled with bad acting and is very badly directed. Annoying and stupid, is simply an adaptation of a Fan-Fiction to cinema, from a mediocre novel by a mediocre writer. The importance of this movie (and the book) lives simply on the dirty minds of the 7 billion people that live in this planet. Well, it is not bad enough to receive 1... I gave 2 for trying. I thing that the Raspberry Awards AKA Razzie Awards have plenty of work in this one... In terms of quality I think this would be the ""Schindler's List"" (1993) of the Razzies. It is still better than ""Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas"" and ""Justin Bieber's Never Say Never"" though."
"nicholasgrubbs3","1","13","20","17 April 2015"," Wow. Just wow. (SPOILERS, but who even cares by now. You know what it's about)
","That was, without a doubt, one of the WORST movies I have ever seen in my life. There was so much wrong with this movie I can't even begin to describe it. The pacing was terrible, the characters were horrendous,the overall feel of the movie was just off putting, and every word that crept out of Christian Grey's mouth sounded like he wanted to rape the viewer. I felt personally attacked by that deranged psychopath with a tie fetish. Let's jump right into the overall problem with the movie: it's based off of Twilight. Twilight was a horrible book series, an even worse movie series, and the inspiration for a horrible fan fiction that led to a horrible book series and an even worse movie series. But what I mean is... it was a little too much like Twilight. Like the way the movie was presented made the entire first act seem like an aged-up version of Twilight with all the terrible scenes from the movie. 1) A horrible introduction to the love interest that has the bulk of the signs that they will be together being them staring at each other. 2) The man lead is a selfish and creepy ass. 3) A parking lot scene that shows that the main character is unlikable when she blows off the better guy/friend for something else. 4) Lots of awkward dialogue between the main characters. 5) No explanation as to why we should give two shits about these people. 6) Jumping WAY too fast into the ""romance"". Those are just the ones off the top of my head. Now let's talk about the main problem I see with this movie: THERE IS NO REASON WHY PEOPLE SHOULD FIND Christian GREY TO BE A SEDUCTIVE CHARACTER THAT DRIPS WITH SEX APPEAL. He sounds like he's going to rape Anastasia for half the movie by the way he talks and he does some extremely questionable actions through the entire movie that begs the question¬Ö Why? Why does a man who takes physical and mental abuse as a turn on deserve to be the man millions of middle aged women lust after? Fabio did that for years but he never seemed rapey when he did it. Christian Grey is one of the most backward characters that has ever cursed the big screen. Oh, and let's not forget all the crimes he committed in this movie. I counted TEN by the end of the movie, but those were just the ones I saw and identified. Let's name some now! 2 counts of kidnapping 1 count of grand theft auto 1 count of selling a stolen good At least 3 counts of stalking At least 2 counts of domestic abuse And my personal favorite¬Ö 1 count of rape. Yes my friends.Christian Grey, the man who brought happiness to millions of women throughout America, is a rapist. They even talk about it in the book, but as far as I know they never mention rape (I haven't read the books as I am not wasting my time reading that trash.) Alcohol is a weapon in rape cases and he sure brought the drink out many times when she was there. The writing was also atrocious. Some of those Ana/Christian conversations had me in tears over how terrible they were. It's mostly in the second and third acts if you want to look for yourself. It's like they went from being a ""rapist talking to a teenage girl"" to ""horribly written rich male talking to dumb as a rock woman"" in a few minutes. Anastasia is truly the dumbest character I have ever seen in a movie. CALL THE POLICE. HE IS MANIPULATING AND ABUSING YOU. I know most women are afraid to do this in abusive relationships, but in this case this is the only option. He stalks her everywhere she goes, he has people watching her all the time and more people keeping her friends away from her, he has kidnapped her many times when she could do nothing to stop him. He is a danger to her health and wellbeing and if she had any cells left in that 4.0 GPA brain, she'd stand up for herself and contact the authorities. THEN she would hire the best team of lawyers she can and sue that prick for every cent he has. Did she consent to most of the sex? Yes she did. Does she have grounds to sue the pants off that psycho? Absolutely. Look at the list of crimes he committed and see how much she can get him for: He beat her with a belt. (abuse) He stole her car and sold it (GTA and then sold said car) Stalked her to places when he was not needed/wanted (Georgia and the bar) Kidnapping (She was drunk and he took her to the hotel AND undressed her and slept beside her. Who knows what he did or could have done? AND she was asleep and he said he'd take her home but instead took her to the middle of the forest. There's a few red flags.) Used alcohol to get her to consent to sex due to lessened inhibitions (RAPE) Those issues aside, it was just a boring and stupid movie. The most comedy we get is Anastasia trying to figure out what buttplugs are and some fisting jokes. Overall, just a dumb movie with a lot of nudity and some sex scenes. Over-hyped, stupid, boring, and extremely uncomfortable to watch. VERDICT: 1/10 because I can't go any lower..."

But it doesn't hold, and scenes that are supposed to be titillating, become laughable, almost on the verge of a Zucker type movie.<br/><br/>When you look at it, the audience have got it all wrong, it's not soft core cheeky cheeky viewing, its consumerist pornography, focusing more on the money,the lifestyle, rather than the selling point.<br/><br/>It's this generations Disclosure, this generations Indecent Proposal, even Basic instinct, and I guarantee, if this was made 25 years ago, one Michael Douglas would have taken the lead role.<br/><br/>It's nothing new, the chemistry is beyond poor, and I was left scratching my head.....<br/><br/>This has really made that much money, and in turn, its bore one of the most unnecessary franchises ever produced in movie history.<br/><br/>It's awful, but it looks good, I'll give it that."

I did not read the book, and consciously did not do any research or reading about it, other than comments here. My wife though she read the book, she had a story in her mind, also the imagination of the characters, especially the female. Even like how the hair would look like in certain scenes.

","College student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) interviews young millionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). He becomes obsessed with her and she starts falling for him. However he has control issues and is into BDSM. Can she deal with that? <br/><br/>Ignore all the controversy about this. In many ways this is just another romantic drama about a couple dealing with issues--those issues just happen to be BDSM and control. It has all the romantic meetings, the nonstop love songs on the soundtrack and some fairly explicit (but tasteful) sex. The BDSM is confined to just two scenes and it's not that bad. There is nudity but almost all of it is from Johnson. Dornan just bares his butt three times and that's it. It seems kind of strange that a movie targeted at women has so little male nudity. It's also well-directed and is more or less interesting. However it goes on for too long and keeps repeating itself. Also the character of Mr. Grey comes across as more than a little creepy. The acting varies. Johnson is very good in her role. Dornan is ridiculously handsome and all pumped up but lacks the charisma that his character should have. All in all a pretty good romantic drama."
"Eiriksterminator","7","9","13","26 April 2015"," Don't understand the hate...
","I felt I had to review this movie just to protest against all the hate for it here...I don't understand all the hate for this movie. People are making so many wrong and absurd claims about the content and intentions of this movie, I can only assume most people just don't get it at all. It does not glorify and promote domestic abuse against women, it is not sexist, and does not contain rape. The sex in it was consensual, and it was made very clear over and over again that the female lead could choose to not go along with it and stop whenever she wanted. If people want to explore different forms of sexual practices than what they (and you, the viewer) are used to, who are you to say that they can't do it, that it's wrong, and that it glorifies violence or whatever other nonsense. The BDSM stuff in this was really tame in comparison to what most real life BDSM practitioners are into anyway. And no, on the other end of the spectrum, that does not mean the movie was an insult to BDSM practitioners either. This isn't a porn movie.<br/><br/>Now, this movie is about two people who are very different, and who have very different desires and values for what is and isn't normal in a relationship, who are trying to make it work, and fail, because they can't reach a middle-ground, understandingly enough. They are physically attracted to each other, but that's it. They are too different, so it's kind of obvious it's doomed to fail. The male lead, Grey, has a rather traumatic past, and has probably been shaped by this, making him a control freak who is unable to open up, and give into romance and/or his real emotions, thinking he HAS to keep the female lead, Ana, at a distance, and that he HAS to be dominant in everything for it to work, and that he can't enjoy it otherwise. I guess you could say he has a bit of a psychological issue/condition. The plot/script was fine to me.<br/><br/>Also, several people here are saying that the acting was bad, but I don't agree. They are also saying the movie wasn't erotic, which I disagree with even more. And as for the women in here who are saying things like that the actor playing Ana was ""irritating, and there were too many close-up shots of her"": You're probably either unable to recognize that Dakota Johnson does in fact have a beautiful body (she does), because you yourself are a woman (which I can't blame you for, it's pretty normal for both guys and girls to often have a hard time seeing what it is the opposite sex finds attractive in people of the same sex as them), or, you're just jealous, and letting that get the better of you. I hope it's the former.<br/><br/>Finally, the music and the cinematography were both very good, in my opinion. This seems to be the only points the haters somewhat agree with me on. In closing, I'd like to point out that one person here who didn't like the movie said that the only people who can like this movie or the book are people who are psycho cult fans who live in their parent's basements, and who wouldn't know good literature or a good love story even if it stared them in the face. I find this very funny, considering I am not only not a psycho cult fan, but also actually have a degree in English language and literature. I've even studied abroad, and am quite used to living by myself. So yeah."

I mean there may be a lot scenes that have not been shown to the general public as well as scenes which have not been portrayed from the book but if you would just consider the tremendous effort that the actors have given, it was all worth it.<br/><br/>I actually appreciate that they cut most of those sexy scenes to focus more on the story because people should understand that there is more to this movie/story than the BDSM sexual relationship.<br/><br/>All in all I am in total awe with the actors with their courage on taking up the lead roles and I am looking forward towards the second installment.

Jamie Dornan brought to life the intricacies of Christian, capturing the controlling/tortured soul. Dakota Johnson brought Ana to life with the innocence of the character and her awe/love of Christian.<br/><br/>Due to the subject matter, I doubt there will be Oscars for these people. However after seeing the performances, with the right academy type roles, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson both have the depth and presence that I could see either of them receiving an Oscar in the near future.<br/><br/>Parents, this is not a children's movie.

","Actors have always said that intimate scenes are the toughest, and as I read the trilogy, I kept thinking 'how are they going to do/say THAT?' The look of the trailers is what attracted me to this story, along with the great soundtrack.<br/><br/>Going in, I was focused on Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey. It's a tough role only because of the hype and controversy that surrounds this film. I am not sure if it's because director Sam Taylor-Johnson is a woman, but I was happy that the camera was on Jamie so much of the time, esp. during the intimate scenes. His Christian is so true to what I had in mind yet he delivers much more than I could have ever imagined. Nothing is lacking; he is intense and strict, playful and also vulnerable. We see him struggling with his new feelings that being with Anna brings out inside of him. <br/><br/>I had doubts about Dakota Johnson as Anastasia; they were dissolved within the first ten minutes of the movie. Her Anna brings light and humor to a serious portrait of two people who are just beginning to work their way through a relationship. I had first noticed her in ""The Social Network,"" and she has definitely changed physically for this part. Hardly any actress can go through their career without showing some skin, not even Meryl Streep (she flashed a coworker in Silkwood) and to show everything (almost, that trophy is still at Sharon Stone's house) in the manner that she does is quite brave.<br/><br/>Wonderful to see Jennifer Ehle and Marcia Gay-Harden as the mothers of Anna and Christian.<br/><br/>This film has artistic merit in the acting, directing, editing and soundtrack. I cannot call it pornography. Sex is all in the mind, so what is nothing to some is everything to others. Having said that, I am looking forward to the second movie, which will be made hopefully with all the same actors but with much less controversy."

This movie is about a awkward quirky girl who falls for a tormented billionaire, who hides behind his dark past. When people say this movie condones and glorifies domestic/sexual abuse, that is ridiculous. If you see this movie and think this, then you didn't see the same movie i did. Watching this movie you can totally tell the Christian obviously gets off on what he does to Ana, but you can clearly also see by his looks and his body language, that he feels terrible by what he does as well. Anastasia also enjoyed what he was doing to her (for the most part). Obviously at the end, she craves more of a romantic relationship with Grey rather then continuing with their arrangement, but he just can't give that to her.. well not yet. All in all, this movie deserves a higher rating than a 3.9.

The storyline didn't even make it through the first book. It did not capture the sensuality and rawness. The only actor that came close to matching what was in my head, while reading the books, was Anna. If you've read the books, I highly doubt you will enjoy the movie. My husband had not read the books and he felt the movie was just 'ok.' Of course, he did say there were scenes he enjoyed. Christian's character has no depth and will surely leave people wondering what are the fifty shades, because this film only portrayed two of his fifty shades.

There's SOO much more to this story. I loved the books but I was hesitant about the movie because let's face it, they never live up to the books, you never feel the same way watching it played out. And that's what happened here. The director and El pretty much touched on key points in the book but rushed through it, never giving the audience a chance to connect with the characters and their back stories like you could while reading. READ THE BOOKS PEOPLE- get past the over described sexual encounters and discover much more that is there within the pages! There are worse books/movies out there I promise lol<br/><br/>So my advice to someone who hasn't read the books and are curious, don't see it. Read the bookS first so you have some sort of idea about WHATS going on. the ending and the characters.

","I don't have much to say about this movie apart from the fact that it's the worst film I've seen all time. The acting is awful, robotic and emotionless the whole movie just made me feel awkward all the way through it's just a weird way to portray such a successful book. I don't understand how there can be no chemistry at any point in a film like this. To me both actors had the same look and tone of voice no matter what was going on in the scene.<br/><br/>Seemed to end in some kind of a dire cliffhanger which I'm guessing is leading to other useless adaptations of the book as a film. What I can can safely say is that won't be seeing another one of the films based around the trilogy again.<br/><br/>My advice save your money. Bottom line I wasted 2 and a half hours I can't get back.<br/><br/>I wish I never saw it."

","This film was not as bad as I thought it would be. I've never read the books but I know this is more tame than that. Dakota Johnson plays a good job as the innocent and cute girl Anastasia . because she is cute herself until she meets christian who could be mistkan for a Playboy. Jamie dornan also does a good job but also comes off as very creepy as well as with a crafty mind louring unsesespecting Anna into a contract she never thought shed sign. And before you could say stranger danger he has her over his leg and in his bed. I will say that this film was not bad. Not great but also not terrible. If the sex scenes were taken away it would be almost a rom com. A good job all together and great for valantines if you were to try it out . 8/10 from me üòè"
"TheLittleSongbird","2","6","8","5 December 2016"," Two minor pros far outweighed by several massive cons
","Hopefully, as a heterosexual female student in her twenties with a love of film that spreads across all genres and decades, this will come over as a fair assessment of a film that genuinely did nothing for me.<br/><br/>Have not read the books, though have heard conflicting opinions that has mostly been intense dislike. The reason for watching 'Fifty Shades of Grey' was not due to wanting to hate on it, being a negative person, curiosity but for the reason of being at a film night with friends recently and 'Fifty Shades of Grey' happened to be the film choice. Just for the record, the general consensus ranged from indifference to hating it with a passion.<br/><br/>There are two minor pros. The best thing about 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is most of the beguiling soundtrack, that has a soothing nostalgia and appropriately amorous quality, this is all for the song choices though. 'Fifty Shades of Grey' also looks good, nice use of scenery and very nicely shot.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Danny Elfman's score is one-note and repetitive, as well as too derivative of his recent work. He has composed some wonderful stuff ('Edward Scissorhands' is magical) but this is really not his best work. The direction has slickness but overall is too mannered which really affects the film's tone and pacing.<br/><br/>Regarding the acting, none of the supporting cast are of note, including Marcia Gay Harden, but a larger issue is the two leads and their complete lack of chemistry. Understated can be a lovely quality to acting, as long as it also becomes nuanced and with believability given to the dialogue. Dakota Johnson, especially in the first third, is too understated that it feels more like there is a lack of personality or emotion. Jamie Dornan looks uncomfortable throughout, delivers his cringe-worthy lines awkwardly and is just bland as dishwater with no charisma whatsoever. Chemistry is non-existent.<br/><br/>'Fifty Shades of Grey's' dialogue does them absolutely no favours, dialogue so bad that absolutely nobody (even the best actors and actresses) can do anything with it. It causes unintentional laughter throughout, is embarrassingly clunky and is pure smut. Then there is the story that is so thin structurally, heavy in repetition, so badly plodding and without style or atmosphere that the film feels twice as long, with the sexual elements done far too tamely and the BDSM portrayal deceitful. None of the characters are engaging or interesting, practically ciphers.<br/><br/>All in all, a very poor film with two minor pros and the rest of the film massively flawed. 2/10 Bethany Cox"

If you're some movie fanatic and want to watch an Oscar nominated movie, don't buy a ticket. And if you're a horny pervert expecting to see a porn and then come on IMDb and bitch that the movie was too boring, don't buy a ticket. Go online and find a porno.

Both main actors played the role the book made them to be. Ana is shy, quiet, corny as she was meant to be. Mr.Grey is controlling, sadistic, and as charming as the book meant him to be. There is nothing more and nothing less from them. They played there part perfectly!<br/><br/>The only reason that I deducted a few stars from my rating was there was some eye roll moments that were meant to be romantic but really just came across as annoying. That was my only problem. But of course, if you're with friends you guys will easily just laugh off those moments.<br/><br/>So to sum this up, Don't LET THE HATERS STOP YOU FROM HAVING A GOOD TIME.

"hamass-mujadid","1","57","115","11 February 2015"," Infinite Shades of Beep-Beep
","Back in 2011, after media cogently pressed me, I read Fifty Shades of Grey. Despite its extremely poor prose, I enjoyed the novel. When I finished it, I tried to not be judgmental about it. But now after watching the movie, I have to be. For lay-men and erotica-loving audience, this movie is their ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Clockwork Orange"". For ticket-not-available-for-any-other-movie unfortunate stakeholders, this might work as well. But for critics, dilettantes, and intellectual people, it's mostly a piece of beep-beep. <br/><br/>Not just that, even the cast was pathetic. Although Dakota Johnson fills the countenance of my imagery of Anastasia Steele, she didn't do justice to her role. She was overly dramatic, artificial, and didn't fully understand her character's prerequisites. She's pretty and all, and perfectly looks like ""Anastasia"" but doesn't feel like her, except when the main couple is frolicking, but that's not acting, only sensual mingling, is it not? Throughout the movie, she tries to appear foxy and overly-sensual through her dialogues and expressions, but miserably fails. It all seemed made-up; the kind you come across with when you're watching a college-level theater play. When I hadn't seen the movie, only the trailer, I actually thought Dakota would make the best Ana, but to my bad, she was utterly disappointing. Nonetheless, she was bearable, and somewhat likable, as paradoxical as it sounds. <br/><br/>And Jamie Dornan, or the pathetic-Christian-Grey as you'd all know him by‚ÄîI literally laughed seeing him (hiding the urge to scream or express my depression). The guy is not slightly the kind anyone predicted. He doesn't look like a magnate; he looks like a third-class, high-school, and hey-my-name-is-Swag guy. There's billionaire neither on his face nor in his gait, although I'd have to appreciate his vocal chords, but they hardly complement the other drawbacks. Halfway into the movie, he starts gaining momentum and stability in his character. By then, it's too late. The impression has already been delivered. I had two choices in mind when I heard that a movie was being made of the book‚ÄîStephen Amell and Matthew Goode. I'm happy that people actually considered these two choices. Stephen, especially, was immensely appropriate. Nobody could do it better than Stephen. His incandescence evidenced in Arrow, where he shows all signs auspicious for Christian Grey. Matthew Goode. He would have been a great choice too, given his gait, his voice, and sophistication, as per his performances up to date. But no, they were stubborn on showing their lack of professionalism throughout. I don't know where the senses and credibility of casting supervisors went that they became so lame during the casting process. <br/><br/>I might not have been disappointed had the cast been suitable. The couple devastated the movie in a manner reminiscent of Kristen Stewart devastating ""Twilight"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", you see what I'm saying? <br/><br/>Now comes the director. In modern film-making, direction is no longer a separate department with separate responsibilities. Director is practically in charge of everything going on with the movie. Sam-Taylor Johnson, just like her husband, is pretty mundane, and banal, the only difference being the different departments both handle. She's nothing extraordinary. I mean it's not evasive; she doesn't have that in her. Such directors can only finish the project, not gloom it. They stick with the hard-lined facts, and produce in millimeters, never thinking about the immaterial perspective of film-making. But then, how good can you direct a movie that sucks so badly at content?<br/><br/>This might be the first time I'm criticizing Universal, which for this movie, wouldn't agree on a NC-17 rating because that would lead to a loss of potential audience. Seriously? Fifty-Shades-of-Grey-fans would have loved it. Even R is explicit enough for parents to stop their children from coming to cinemas. What difference would NC-17 have made? Let me answer this ""rhetorical"" question: it would have allowed the movie to elevate the otherwise below-ordinary script. Screenplay writer Kelly Marcel didn't really have any other option than to use explicitness of the novel in the movie, but everybody rejected it. If they had stuck to the originality of the novel (which by the way sucked too), they'd have been able to pull out something that both entertains mass audience, and gets appreciated, if only a little, by true aesthetes. <br/><br/>I would still say that I enjoyed my time watching it. The erotica sure was catchy, and don't be judgmental, everybody gets a turn-on on something that explicit. Also, there's always something sentimental and lovable about romantic movies. The ethereal sexuality was highly complemented by the score and songs. Beyonc√©, in particular, nailed it. In fact, the main reason why the movie is ruling the media nowadays is her exquisite performance. The last trailer, for example, exhibiting Haunted, enjoyed a massive fan following, later providing an esteemed platform for the movie itself.<br/><br/>In my opinion, screenplay writers should have had the audacity to change the theme, mold it to perfection, make it more sound and logical, and not make something that only shows a guy proving mainstream feminists true. The audience, at least the post-modernist one, does not follow a strict line. It's only looking for the line of best fit. Plus, it wasn't the adaptation of a sci-fi novel that there might have been a chance of all logic and equations gone awry.<br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey made James's life a heaven; maybe she was good at luck. The book didn't deserve an applause, really. The movie? Well I'd give it something, considering the effort it takes to make a movie with this much and this kind of sex without turning it into porn.<br/><br/>Five Shades to Grey; I think that'll suffice."
"jchanel85","9","28","52","14 February 2015"," ...because there will always be negative critics
","After reading all three of E.L James's erotic novels, I fell more in love with the ""love story"" even more then the sexual encounters that the two characters experience throughout their journey. Needless to say, the movie encaptured just that! <br/><br/>Leads Jamie Dornan, and Dakota Johnson were a terrific pairing for portraying Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. The novel very intricately describes Christian Grey as a brooding handsome billionaire entrepreneur who invests most of his time in his work and not being very social, having little to not many friends, just acquaintances. Having an obsession for S&M due to being victimized in his youth he knows nothing more, but comes to find love in the end. The same goes for Dakota Johnson's character of Anastasia Steele, whom unlike her devastatingly handsome co-star, has never been introduced to the dominant and submissive lifestyle and for that matter had never even experienced the touch of a mans hand. Always having her head in a book and living her life out as a college student day by day, her character is thoughtful, humorous and witty. <br/><br/>For the women and men whom have read the novel and prepared to witness the on- screen attraction between these two characters, this is DEFINITELY a factor! These two co-stars seemed very much into each others characters as well as portraying their own with remarkable ease. To be able to bring the love story to life must have been (I am assuming) an easy task for director Sam-Taylor, due to the fact that she had chosen to fantastic leads! However, for an rated ""R"" film with more than a million in attendance from the novel alone, to grasp the extremities of the sexual encounters that these two characters experience must have been a task not so easy to portray on film. Between ""vaginal fisting"" and ""nipple clamps"" with much more detail in explaining these many sexual acts throughout the NOVEL, I'm sure bringing this to life on the BIG SCREEN must have been a challenge and would be for any director trying to capture that experience. For most women, we just want to feel loved in every way by a man, whether that means sexually and/or emotionally. I believe this film held its bargain to producing BOTH!<br/><br/>There will always be those who want more out of a film, but being able to portray these acts on a movie screen would be much more like pornographic film than anything else, and I don't think that this was E.L James's intentions when she created the story! Yes, things do most DEFINITELY heat up a bit, but in the long run, the story that is unfolded is one of love as did the novel (if you have read these novels, you would know this). I do agree with some critics that they could have carried out more scenes from the novel on screen, however for a 2 hour film, capturing the essence of both the ""sex"" and the ""attractions between the two characters"" was perfection, classy and tasteful for being a film based off of an S&M novel.<br/><br/>I am extremely happy with the way this film resembled the novel and am hoping that future critics will look more into the love story behind it rather than a film strictly all in response to sex and the acts of sex and nothing else, for this is not what the true readers know and adore about their 50 shades of Grey."
"prospectus_capricornium","4","37","72","11 February 2015"," An Erotic Visual Spectacle with Disgustingly Thin Storyline
","One of today's most popular YA novels, FIFTY SHADES of GREY assumes new life on the big screen with a promise of dark, savage and erotic romance.<br/><br/>The film's backbone traces the sizzling sexual correspondence between young journalism major, Anastasia Steele, and the handsome billionaire, Christian Grey. Their relationship bears perfect resemblance to that of a master and his slave, only that it runs almost entirely through seemingly endless sexual encounters. Other than that, good looking actors, and the utmost loyalty it obviously paid to the book, there is nothing much to expect in this movie.<br/><br/>While it offers a jaw-dropping and explosive sexual panorama, the movie's exceedingly horrible and almost empty script ruins everything.You wouldn't blame the actors, really, for they seem perfectly fit for their roles, in fact, you would praise them considering how still well they carry out their characters amid of the disgustingly thin, resource material they work with. Aside from the biting stares and one word exchanges between the leads, it would be head-achingly difficult to squeeze out any meaningful conversations between the two, that it would be as perfectly fine watching the movie in mute. The film's screenwriters obviously intends to be 100% loyal to the book, and make the fans happy, and they're probably successful, but at the expense of pushing the movie's overall quality past being mediocre.<br/><br/>On the cover, FIFTY SHADES is blazing, titillating and bold, a cinematic behemoth on the scale of seductive and erotic art, but on the inside, this film hauls almost nothing that could be of any sense or substance. This movie might have satisfied millions with all the excessive amount of skins and waist-down actions it presented, but not me. Lol. I give this film 4/10 stars."

","This is one of those movies that you are going to either love or hate, and you are going to judge hard depending on your beliefs and knowledge about the BDSM lifestyle. if your going to watch this movie and have no experience in the true BDSM lifestyle then you need to watch it with a completely open mind. You have to pick up on the details. Everything in BDSM is in the details... and that holds true with this movie. If you go in with a closed mind your going to view it as a soft porn flick.<br/><br/>I haven't read the books, but i have been a dominant in BDSM for 20 years, which makes me somewhat of an expert on the subject. You must understand that BDSM in its nature and at its core is very sexual as are the people that live the lifestyle. In fact, we call those not in the lifestyle ""vanilla"".<br/><br/>Most people will think that a Dominant/submissive relationship is weird or wrong. But most people are actually in one. You are in one at work, its just not sexual. In most relationships one partner has more control than the other... one is more dominate than the other in the relationship. BDSM just takes that to a higher , more controlled level without all the power struggle found in many vanilla relationships. <br/><br/>So I am going to break down a few key subjects in the movie:<br/><br/>1)poor submissive girl, rich dominant man- Not typical. However, this is a way in which they try to portray to vanilla people "" a powerful man"" 2)Most people get into BDSM in their 20s or it comes later in life. Grey being taken in as a submissive at 15 is not at all normal and that is greatly frowned upon.<br/><br/>3)99.9% of girls that get into the life are not virgins. Though I have met a few girls in their early 20s that claim to be. Also most experienced dominants find virgins to be undesirable. We want you to have some clue as to how things work.<br/><br/>4)Consent is always given. In the movie this was done with the contract which is very common. Also a ""blanket"" consent was given by anna when grey told her that should could leave at any time and that his helicopter would take her anywhere she wanted to go. There was no need to repeat this later in the movie as its basically a verbal contract. The submissive understands if he/she stays they are at the whim of the dom, but they may leave at any time. A contract would set defined boundaries and the submissive would not be allowed to leave when they wish. Otherwise this would give the submissive all the power and make the entire concept pointless( called topping from the bottom).<br/><br/>5)Spankings/punishment/bondage are all common parts of BDSM. Spanking is sometimes used as a punishment, but since most female submissives like it, its rather ineffective as a punishment. It is also sensation play as were the ice cubes. Bondage is very common..sometimes simple like bound hands and others much more complex. Punishments are common. Most vanillas see this as abuse.However, the submissive agrees to accept punishments so its consentual. Also TRUE Dominants are very restrained individuals with a lot of self control. This isn't a drunken hubby beating his wife cause she made a sarcastic remark. This is someone, for all intents and purposes, who is an expert at self control and corporal punishments.<br/><br/>6) A submissives safety and well being( including emotional and mental)is of the utmost priority. Aftercare( care after an session) is pretty much standard though it seemed to be lacking from grey. This may of been to make him look more ""dominant"" to vanilla viewers, but it actually only makes him look uncaring.<br/><br/>7)Dominants care about their submissives. Grey was portrayed as cold and uncaring who sort of warmed up to anna. Dominants are actually a lot more caring than their vanilla counterparts... Which to a vanilla seems unbelievable since they seem from the outside to be very selfish. Dominants tend to be more selfless than most vanilla people and some submissives. So this part of the movie wasn't the norm. Though you would find a few like that.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is very mild compared to the real deal and while it captures some of the lifestyle quite well, other parts it doesn't do as well on. And a few it gives a bad ( and inaccurate) impression of. It wasn't near as bad as i thought it would be and i actually quite enjoyed seeing how the lifestyle was portrayed to the mainstream public."

If you're planning on getting your kicks with your partner or using this as a means to broach the subject don't. This movie might have just killed the pun ""still a better love story than Twilight"".

"katiebabsg","6","58","121","9 February 2015"," A Romantic Comedy with dark undertones and eroticism. Takes Out All the BS/WTF and Fan Fiction elements from the Book
","For those who may not be aware, Fifty Shades of Grey was once an erotic Twilight fan fiction that was pulled and published, becoming a massive global hit with over 100 million copies sold. As there are many lovers and fans of the book series, there's a great amount of ""haters"" or harsh critics of the books.<br/><br/>After the movie ended I was completely stunned, as in my jaw dropped. The reason- I liked this movie, more than I thought I would, a great deal more. I really thought I would dislike it and find so many faults, much like the book. If you're a fan of the Fifty Shades of Grey book, you will eat up this movie and love it, hungry for more. If you haven't read Fifty Shades of Grey, you will enjoy the movie for what it is and will be anxious to see Fifty Shades Darker, the sequel, which was announced as moving forward. Fifty Shades of Grey was very entertaining, with many moments of humor and a romance that should appeal to both men and women. It's a perfect date movie, including one for Valentine's Day. Those who are looking for more spice in their movies, Fifty Shades of Grey is the movie to see. The love scenes are well choreographed and sexy. When the time comes for the BDSM scenes, they are extremely well done and very erotic.<br/><br/>Every cheesy WTF moment found in the book with the silly, ridiculous sayings and fan fiction element was erased. The filmmakers made the right decision by taking out the eye rolling trademark phrases and like the ""oh my's"" and ""inner goddess"" Anastasia Steele, the heroine loves to spew. Christian Grey, her hero's trademark line, ""later's baby"" is there, but the delivery of how it was spoken is cute and sweet. Christian's twitchy palms is also in there, and again delivered in a great way. The love scenes and scenes of sexual bondage, torture and foreplay are tasteful and somewhat artistic in tone. The manic, abusive elements Christian portrays in the book are gone. His possessive is toned down enough in the movie that it's believable. His reason he doesn't do romance and needs to be a Dominant, and Ana his submissive isn't far-fetched when it's revealed and explained.<br/><br/>The credit for making Fifty Shades of Grey movie a success are because of four people. Screenwriter, Kelly Marcel, and director, Sam Taylor Johnson deserve major kudos for their work. These two brought Fifty Shades of Grey to life in a way I would have never expected and admired. These two are just important as the actors on screen. The focus is on Ana and Christian, the main couple. All the other characters come and go and rarely have much screen time. Kate Kavanagh, Ana's best friend and roommate played by Eloise Mumford made the most with her role. She ate up the screen anytime she appeared. If given more screen time, she would have been a force of nature.<br/><br/>There have been many opinions about the casting of Ana and Christian. From the press tour and random scenes shown from the movie of Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, it looks like they're all wrong for the roles. Awkward and bad chemistry comes to mind. I'm a happy to say that Dakota and Jamie's chemistry is alive and well in the movie. Jamie Dornan is the one everyone has concentrated on. He plays the role of Christian more than adequately, but there's still a stiffness and remoteness to his portrayal. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but even though I wasn't as enthralled with him as I should, I will say that when it came to the love scenes and BDSM centric action, he made me believe he was a true Dominant. His delivery, whether it was seducing Ana or blindfolding and tying her up and flogging her was, panty dropping, I need to take a cold shower ASAP. This man let loose and wild, no holds barred sexual takeover in the sex scenes.<br/><br/>The one person who deserves more praise than anyone else is Dakota Johnson. Jamie plays second fiddle to her. I had some concerns with her in the beginning. The first twenty minutes are the most problematic. It sets up the story and the introduction of Ana, the college English literature senior, about to graduate, and Christian, the twenty-seven elusive billionaire. Dakota was channeling Kristen Stewart ala Bella Swan from Twilight in the first fifteen minutes, complete with being clumsy and falling to the floor in Christian's office, to the non-stop lip biting. But the lip-biting is a running joke, throughout the movie, but one that fits. The moment I become invested in this movie, and knew it was a winner was the scene where Dakota as Ana gets drunk and drunks dials Christian. That five minute scene shows Dakota's comedic skills, which is throughout the movie. She starts out as this almost fragile, plain and basic young woman, who transforms into a more self-assured saucy, tells it like she means it woman. I would go as far to say she steals some of the scenes away from Jamie. Dakota as Ana keeps her girl next door package, but also brings out her temptress. Simply put, Dakota owns the Ana role and runs with it.<br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey is a Rom-Com with dark undertones. The first half appears to be a romantic comedy and then slowly becomes more intense and serious. The humor isn't out of place, and when we get to that point where Christian shows Ana his red room of pain, as she calls it, you're invested completely, wanting to stay with Ana and Christian, even during their most private intimate moments, no matter how dark they may seem."

Not only was the acting terrible, there was absolutely no chemistry and in my opinion he didn't have the right ""look"" or mannerisms for the part. It was literally painful to watch. They tried to add a little humor and playfulness to the movie, to most likely hide the seriousness of the subject matter, but it was an epic fail. They should have played more on the drama aspect of it and not worried about the subject matter. If they can make movies about war and serial killers, horror films, etc., they should have at least done this movie justice by making an excellent film. <br/><br/>The lack of depth and character development was a huge mistake."

"GranPrew","3","32","63","12 February 2015"," The Best Comedy of 2015 So Far
","There were times during my (honestly more than a little intoxicated) viewing of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" where the movie genuinely made me wonder if I was watching a parody of E.L. James' horrible book. The entire audience and I guffawed heartily at several of the early scenes, and I got the impression that we were all laughing with the film and not at it. Even more numerous were the times where I felt I was laughing AT it, and the times where I was so thoroughly baffled at the characters' actions and their development, or so massively bored by the tame and interminable scenes of protracted S&M, that I almost took a conscious decision to drink myself into a stupor and miss out on the ending; a big emotional moment that will probably lose what little meaning it has as soon as the inevitable sequel rolls around.<br/><br/>Inconsistency in tone is far from the only problem the film has, though. The borderline glorification of abusive relationships, poor acting, bad dialogue and a frankly (James got final say on the casting, after all) surprising lack of chemistry between the leads (Dornan is by far the biggest culprit here) certainly go a long way in making this film a lot more enjoyable at its worst, but the aforementioned boring bits are SO boring, and so unendingly devoted to the book, that whatever schadenfreude I got from them is simply insufficient for me to squeeze out an ironic recommendation. A saddening fact, because I could easily see myself endorsing an intentionally funny parody or an unintentionally hilarious slavish adaptation, but not a mismatched hybrid of both.<br/><br/>I have a feeling that the people involved in the making of this picture could have cooked up a pretty decent parody of the laughable new wave of ""mommy porn"" erotic novels that E.L. James inspired. As it stands, though, they crafted what is probably the single best adaptation that anyone could have possibly made from the source material.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that is not saying much. At all.<br/><br/>Funny as hell, though. Even if I got more titillation out of Alexander Portnoy's liver episode."

I don't want to see them talking, and talking, and continue to talk.<br/><br/>However. Even though I've never read the book, the film showed me a whole new side to it that I didn't realise. This isn't a sex story which to many people think. It's a story about two people who want a relationship, but they want two different kinds of relationships. She's wanting a boyfriend to sleep next to and have date nights but he's wanting this whole dominance thing. This is a love story! not a porno.<br/><br/>Overall, there was a lot of pressure on two upcoming actors and you can not fault them for doing the best they possibly could.

"vistheindian","2","30","59","13 February 2015"," Fifty Shades of B.S.
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is a naive literature student, who goes to interview billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). They both are instantly attracted to each other. However, Anastasia's life is changed forever as she enters Christian's luxurious and sexual world. Fifty Shades of Grey is horrible. A soft-core porn masquerading itself as something more. Laughable dialog and shallow caricatures, although plentiful are the least of its problems. Avoid this movie at all cost, please don't support such horrid excuse for a film.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>I understand the appeal of exploring sexual fantasies. Considering the world-wide sensation that was the novel, there is a lot of curiosity to know what all the fuss is about. That curiosity is what got me to go to the cinema to check it out. I really wish Doc Brown's DeLorean arrives this year so I can stop the past me from making this terrible mistake.<br/><br/>I am not an unreasonable guy, so I'll start with the positives. The cinematography is done well, it looks good. However, polish a turd as much as you want, in the end it's still a turd.<br/><br/>There are two reactions you will have to the dialog: laughter at its absurdity or cringing at its awkwardness. There is no flow to what's being said. They'd be sitting at a dinner table having a conversation and out of nowhere Anastasia will say ""will you make love to me now?"" I instantly thought of Ron Burgundy's meme of That Escalated Quickly. Little did I know I should have saved that meme thought for the immediate gem of a line from Christian ""I don't make love, I f***."" Well at least he gets right to his point. What teenager wrote this script? It makes Twilight feel like Shakespeare.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the caricatures, yes caricatures because these aren't characters. Christian only has one mood setting, deeply brooding. The only other way to describe him is, rich. On the other hand, Anastasia is desperately made to look like a simple innocent small town girl. Oh look she drives a beat up VW Beetle, oh she's from a small town in Georgia, oh she doesn't own computer, oh she still uses a flip phone from her middle school, oh she doesn't have fancy clothes. We get it! Move on.<br/><br/>If you are thinking I am looking too into this, and that all I have mentioned are just means to an end which are the titillating BDSM scenes, fair enough, let me address those scenes. They are simply not sexy, there is no chemistry whatsoever. Most of the time it doesn't even feel like Anastasia wants to be there. If you are looking to be shocked by the craziness of BDSM, except for the last scene it is actually quite mild. There are other movies that handle the topic of sex much better. For example, The Little Death, about taboo fantasies and how real couples deal with them, or Nymphomaniac about sex addiction and how it consumes you, or Secretary about the psychology behind BDSM.<br/><br/>But the most insulting of all, that I can't understand how it is acceptable in the mainstream, is how weak of a ""character"" Anastasia is. The entire movie, she doesn't stand on her own. Even though she is being emotionally abused, she needs a man. Even when she is whipped and doesn't enjoy it, she is still in love with him. What did he do to deserve your love Anastasia? Oh right, new computer, new dresses, new Audi, helicopter rides, and glider rides. Simply insulting.<br/><br/>So please, do not watch this movie. I know I've used the phrase, avoid at all cost, before for reviews of bad movies, but in this case I really mean it. If you are being dragged to see this movie, bribe your friend to not make you go. It's better use of your money anyway. I hate to rant non-stop, but for this movie I had to. If this review saves even one soul from the misery I've endured, I'll consider my life's purpose on this little rock we call Earth, complete.<br/><br/>I was battling to rate this movie either 1 or 2 out of 10, but I opted for the higher rating. Why you ask? Because it managed to get a man in his mid-20s to complain about a movie filled with sex scenes. That's an amazing feat in itself that I must commend.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"
"jadeflowers1","3","29","57","13 February 2015"," Better chemistry with my cup of tea
","Before writing this review I would like to point out I have read all 3 books twice and throughly enjoyed them even though they may resemble fan-fiction to twilight this didn't bother me because I also enjoyed the twilight saga. Now onto the movie.<br/><br/>I had been looking forward to this film for months and I felt that Dakota Johnson and Jamie Doran were great fits for both roles... until I saw them act; chemistry between the two during the start of the film was appalling Jamie seemed so uncomfortable when reading any of his lines and Dakota was either looking down the whole time mumbling her words or just trying to over-act. I didn't feel any character development or a bond between either of them. There was no sexual tension or chemistry between the two what so ever and quite frankly I had a better bond with my cup of tea when I got home than they did on screen. <br/><br/>The filmography was awful it didn't leave you on the edge of your seat wanting more because as soon as a scene started to get good it would instantly fade out and head onto the next one, I felt as if they had taken every part of the book and tried to fit it into a film that only lasted 2 hours therefore leaving only 10 minute scenes to explain very specific parts of the story. However the money spent on the film and scenery was good.<br/><br/>The sex scenes was laughable too... the constant use of body doubles was very obvious to me and frustrated me if you're going to accept a movie role made about S&M at least have the guts to be naked on screen.<br/><br/>In conclusion the overview of the film just put me in a bad mood, I sat there thinking 'what an ass hole' when judging Christan's character which I know that writer E.L James never intended, I felt the film was perceived as a manipulative billionaire who was trying to take advantage of a young virgin using money and charm which is so unfortunate when I know that the books did not intend this. Perhaps the writers felt leaving more out of Christians past would open up doors to the next film but it didn't work for me. Also I did just use the verb writers, but I'm not sure if this film was even re-wrote for the screens, or they had literally just chucked a book at Jamie and Dakota and asked the to read out their favourite parts in a monotone dialect.<br/><br/>In conclusion the film was overrated and marketing shouldn't have spent such a big budget on advertising the film when it was garbage. <br/><br/>Jade Flowers."
"Joytoyxx","1","19","35","15 February 2015"," As expected.
","Yes, i have read the book, and i don't like it at all, but at least it has SOME purpose. Women in middle ages that aren't satisfied with their marriage, miss adventures and aren't a type of person for watching porn consider it pretty fun. Totally understandable, it doesn't really have any art value, but its purpose is FUN!<br/><br/>But talking about the movie... that was a total failure. Seems like person who wrote scenario and made this movie hasn't even read the book, because the story actually lost that only purpose it had.<br/><br/>Wrong selection of actors, first of all. They did awful job, Dakota is so lame in scenes that demand natural reactions, like falling down and being scared, drunk, surprised, etc., and that's the most important part of being Anastasia Steele. And Jamie is nothing but a sissy, which is exactly the opposite of how he should be. It's probably more a fault of director, but he smiles when not supposed to, talks what not supposed to, and that makes Christian Grey in the movie way too different than the one from the book. A lot of important parts from the book are missed, or just changed, the point is lost after first 10 minutes. If there were no good camera work, scenery and so, i'd say that this movie is made by high school kids.<br/><br/>The book can be liked by women in middle ages or horny teenagers, but movie can be liked by LOW IQ-ed people that can't recognize the quality and people who masturbate to bdsm, but didn't have a chance to search youjizz, because i still think that it contains better material than this crap."

","This movie adaptation of the first book from the Blockbuster Trilogy of the E.L James novels, 50 shades of Grey, for me was 50 shades of what to do wrong in a book adaptation movie. First let me express the artistic qualities in the movie and acting. This movie exists only because of the success from the book trilogy that was targeted for women over 30 years of age. Why then make a movie that is basically watching a Twilight movie, this will surely disappointing for the novel fans. I understand why they might get influenced from this vampire movie, since both of them take place in Seattle, but you cant have a movie based on a novel for an audience of women over 30 or at least mature minded women over 20, watching the acting of the twilight saga with bad lines of BDSM or bondage scenes, which by the way this scenes have nothing of BDSM, basically just nipple showing and bad acting. The acting in my opinion was terrible, the adaptation from the novel was horrible and I think I am not going to be the only one disappointed in this movie. I would only suggest this movies for girls from 18 to 21 years of age, who are Twilight fans, since it seems more like a soft porn TV made movie, than a box office hit."
"Kicino","3","28","55","13 February 2015"," When hot rich dominant guy meets innocent college grad desperate for love: story of abused love
","Fifty Shades of Grey is quite a disappointment, although the book is not that good to start with. <br/><br/>Dakota Johnson who plays Ana, the innocent college graduate who is desperate for love but has been waiting for the right person, is pretty and acts alright. But Jamie Dornan who plays the filthy rich young CEO Christian Grey is quite a disaster. Yet I think it is the plot (if there is any), the script, and the direction that kills it. <br/><br/>To start with, the plot was weak, as in the novel. But at least in the book there is some suspense which attracts you to find out what kind of person Grey is and how his haunted past has turned him into such a mysterious and strange person today. This suspense is fascinating as many women like to play the role of martyr/curer so as to ""save"" the man they think they love, even if it means sacrificing themselves. So it is rewarding seeing Grey changes his behavior patterns (eg not do the girlfriend thing, not sleep with women etc) because of Ana who probably wants to be his last woman. This in itself is a conquering feeling that would keep the audience/reader enticed.<br/><br/>In a way, it is almost like a modern fairy tale ‚Äì Cinderella is picked up by the pumpkin-turned horse carriage and Ana is swept off the feet by all those new electronic gadgets, a brand new car, and a helicopter and a glider ride by the man she feels intrigued with, not to mention Grey always appears like a white knight who saves her from all kinds of embarrassment. <br/><br/>What's more, it is the abundance, spontaneous, various, intense and sometimes kinky sex that sustain the fascination in the book. Unfortunately they are drastically left out in the movie, hence making it less interesting to watch. Perhaps the hot sex would be difficult to show in pure graphic language. But better direction would have led the audience to imagine without laying everything out like an XXX rated movie ¬Ö <br/><br/>Even Grey's wealth and taste is lamely portrayed. His supposedly luxurious apartment looks drab and bland. With the empty and heartless dialogues, it feels like a trashy afternoon TV drama with a weak plot, slow pace and non-arousing love scenes only bored and overweight housewives would watch. <br/><br/>And all these is even before mentioning the negative criticism on domestic violence the film receives. Mind you though, Ana wants to know more about Christian and help him. That's why she is willing to step into this uncertainty, even it means letting herself be hurt. But perhaps a sensible woman would leave at such point and only a fictional character would exercise such involvement. Thus as reader and audience, we would feel safe while vicariously entering such risky relationships. <br/><br/>The book itself, despite its mounting sales, is of limited literal achievement. However, I must admit it serves like a manual where it is tempting to try out some new functions. But other than that, the plot, character development, and theme are quite weak. Unfortunately the movie is worse. I would not recommend watching it with your date. In fact, you probably would not miss much not watching it. Briefly scan the book instead, there might be some practical tips you can pick up."

Dornan's take on Christian Grey was extremely boring, lacking all the intensity that the readers love. His words had nothing to them and it was nothing like I imagined in the book. Ana, played by Dakota Johnston was really irritating and painful to watch. It failed to go in to any depth and skimmed briefly through most events in the book.

People are commenting on how her hair and clothes were ugly, well YEAH! You've obviously never read the books, she was meant to dress like that! She goes from the ugly duckling to a pretty 'princess'! I thought it was great how they had snips of humor- i think that was one of the ONLY reasons my boyfriend continued to sit in his chair. The sex scenes were hot, for what they were having to do in front of a camera, I thought they were good. On to Jamie... he was just okay. Looks wise, he was very sexy in his suits and his EYE'S! I think his accent was very, very sexy! But as for his acting? I'm sure he is a good actor, but for Grey? I didn't think he was at ALL like Grey.

","Sam Taylor-Johnson tried, she really did but it seems like she just couldn't get from under E. L. James's thumb. The result is probably the worst ""romantic"" film in the whole history of cinema. There are approximately 16 min that are worth removing from the film and watching separately - and I'm kindly including the timings (you're welcome). They mainly are good because they are steamy (what the hype promised) and the characters don't talk. Here they are: 42:25-45:18; 47:50- 50:50; 1.02:47-1.05:30, 1.19:17- 1.19:43; 1.26:58-1.30:34; 1.47:54-1.49:31<br/><br/>Jamie Dornan's wooden acting and tasteless sets aside,I honestly have really had enough of misguided fans exclaiming that Christian Grey is just ""troubled "" and ""misunderstood"" and Fifty Shades of Grey (both the book - to use the term loosely - and the film) have nothing to do with domestic violence. <br/><br/>Wake up, please and smell the horrid stench of complacency. Bad things happen because we let them happen - both to ourselves and to others. The popularity of an abusive relationship portrayed as romantic has done and is continuing to do its insidious damage - the violence against women remains at high levels and narratives like this are causing substantial damage.<br/><br/>How on Earth manipulating, coercing, stalking, controlling and actually beating a woman is not violence (as emphasised by some of the reviews)? Coercive or controlling behaviour is now officially a crime in UK (and not a minute too soon by the way).<br/><br/>Artistic/Entertainment points aside the film clearly shows a young woman with an unformed sexual identity who may yet be unsure of what she wants and likes - she seems however quite quite sure that she isn't interested in BDSM as a lifestyle and barely interested in it as a sexual practice - she is happy with the simplest sensation-play but she definitely doesn't want humiliation-play, pain-play, immersive submission or any of the other more involved BDSM practices.<br/><br/>The whole of the above is actually summed up in one of the exchanges they have where Anna asks him why would she do it. He says ""to please me"". She then says ""what do I get out of it"" and he says ""me"". <br/><br/>This portrayal of BDSM here is unfair and deceitful - it offends the very principles of the practice which are Sane, Safe and Consensual. Anna doesn't seem to be very interested in the lifestyle, it makes her laugh and she doesn't understand it. The only reason why she goes into it at all is because she is attracted to the ""troubled"" creep who manipulates and coerces her from the very start.<br/><br/>We don't see any after-care nor any real discussions about partner's limits other than the most absurd signing of a BDSM contract imaginable. <br/><br/>Furthermore, a Dominant is not someone who actually enjoys hurting another person - that is not what BDSM is about. The relationship of Dom and sub is intricate but it is based on trust and on responding to the deepest needs of the submissive partner. Popular to contrary belief, a Dom can only let go as far as their sub will allow - not only that but a He/She has to remain in control all the time and make sure that their partner doesn't get harmed by being unable to say ""stop"" when experiencing a powerful endorphin rush. One person at another person's mercy is the fantasy and it is and has to be very convincing for it to work but in reality, the Dominant is fulfilling the submissive's needs first and foremost.<br/><br/>Certain sexual practice is not something that people can be ""convinced"" of. It doesn't work that way. You can't make someone like something they have no interest in. That undermines the very essence of being human - our free will. And if this is not violence then I don't know what it is.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter one iota if a guy ""had a terrible childhood"" or anything like that - how is that relevant? If he is disturbed then it's up to him to get help etc and not to inflict violence on innocent vulnerable women. I don't know what the writer - I use the term loosely - was thinking and I appreciate that the director tried to improve it but this atrocious story is beyond saving."

In the film & book Anastasia holds all the power, she chooses to have sex with Christian in the first place then chooses to explore her boundaries with someone she feels safe with, whereas throughout the book & film Christian is unwilling to push his boundaries - which again is his choice.<br/><br/>We all have boundaries of some sort - they could be from previous experiences, or cultural or religious, there are endless ways for people to have boundaries real or fictional. In life as in the film the important thing is to discuss your boundaries with your partner, what you want out of the relationship and your expectations; in the film & book Anna is much better at telling Christian what she wants, Christian writes rules & tells a sleeping Anna the reasons for his boundaries.<br/><br/>I find the likening to abuse disheartening & reactionary, in the book & film Anna asked Christian to push her boundaries & tries all sorts of physical touch including spanking & whipping, the fact that she didn't like being whipped was part of the story & leads on to the next chapter, it was done within the context of a submissive/dominant relationship where both parties consent, the complete opposite of abuse. Being in a submissive/dominant relationship is as much a persons right to choose as only having sex on Saturday nights with the lights off."

As a former student of cinema, I do pay attention in every single detail and I could actually direct this movie better than who did. There was no sensuality, no erotism, not chemistry between the actors, not a drop of sweat, they didn't even kiss with tongue, nobody had an orgasm, nothing, just some slaps on the butt, duh and for calling himself a ""dominant"" in a BDSM world ""Christian Grey"" was way to amateur, practically a virgin himself, there was not a believable scene in this movie, maybe when she was crying, but even then it looked more like a soap opera. Btw... Jamie Dornan disappointed me. I do prefer him as a serial killer in the British series ""The Fall"". I do blame the director for this poor movie, more than I do the actors. The movies ""Secretary"" with Maggie Gyllenhaal and ""9 1/2 Weeks"" with Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger are my favorites on this genre."

","I started reading the book and thought at first how bad the English was. But beyond the lack of vocabulary and grammar, it was just very wrong to romanticize S&M and sexual violence/humiliation. We are in the modern world where woman work and stand up for themselves. It was kind of a joke to see the innocent, insecure whimpy stupid girl like Ana. I never finished the book because it gave such a wrong message to young girls who have never experienced love. The movie itself makes it worst because of the gorgeous actors and Hollywood-version of something crappy. I could not sit through the end of the movie either. What a bad investment! I am ashamed to say I wasted money on it."

","First I must say I had heard about the book, I saw the book on sale everywhere, and really dismissed it as maybe a cheap porn story that somehow got over on the young general public. But, then as time went on I began reading stories in the news of increased pregnancies among women who have read the book and in some cases were experiencing what they believed were fertility problems prior to reading the book. After reading the novel they became pregnant with out the use of fertility drugs and they say that this story inspired them and helped them relax enough to become impregnated. I just had to see the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is at its core a unique love story about give and take, selfishness and selflessness, love and appreciation. It's about ""The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game"". It's about love hurting and healing. If you're going in for the sexual freak aspect you are missing the underlying story which is quite an emotional ride. See this with someone you love or want to love. It may make a big difference or a new start. The two young actors had great chemistry. I will eventually read the book. Uniquely this is sex selling love."
"ginanaf2","2","13","23","16 February 2015"," Not a fan, but based on the book this was a Big disappointment!
","After a lot pressure from my best friend, I read the first book of 50 shades because I wanted to have a clue of what I was going to see. I was hearing all the fuss about it so many years now, but never really get interested in reading it. I saw the trailer last year and I was intrigued, but only for the film, not the book though.<br/><br/>OK, the book is not a literature masterpiece, that's for sure. Definitely not a fan, but I'm trying to see the good side in all things, and the good side about this book is that it's very graphic, detailed and makes you wanna see in reality what you're reading... Epic love of insanely hot/powerful/dark-sided man with an ordinary girl/later woman. Let's face it!! These stuff sell like crazy. Girls like to imagine prince charming and even more they like it when prince charming has his dark sides (because girls like bad boys), and despite those dark sides, he is devoted to them and love them no matter what. In case he makes a blow-minding sex, it's even better!!!!<br/><br/>You can read it in less than a week. No special thinking, no difficult writing. A ""kinky"" Twilight in nowadays life. And for all the people who say why refer to this book and think of Twilight, it's because the author herself admitted that 50 Shades is based on Twilight fan fiction!!!<br/><br/>Now for the movie: For God's sake, tons of people were waiting to see this book come to life, just don't disappoint them like that!! Pay more attention in the cast, the screenplay, everything. And if it's not good enough, postpone it as long as it takes to find the right ingredients to make at least a decent movie that will entertain ESPECIALLY the fans of the book! But no no no.. <br/><br/>So amateur work.. it's like they were hasting to finish the film, get the money and run out of the door. No plot, no character development, no CHEMISTRY!!! My God, I'd seen in the trailer the scene with the kiss in the elevator and I was waiting to see it sooooo bad, and what did I get??? NOTHING!! No passion, no flame! A simple line, and a ""kiss"".. Where was the tension, the passion, the desperation??? All these things are obvious in the book, no matter how badly/simply written it is. This scene was very important for the plot, to see the passion that Christian has for this girl. That he cannot wait until she signs the contract, in order to kiss her... And we see a scene with nothing... just nothing!! The elevator walls were more passionate.. <br/><br/>From that point, I knew that it was going to be a total disaster.. The movie was 2 hours, the audience was laughing during 90% of time. And I bet that 75% of the people, were fans of the book. Beside me was sitting a girl almost 15 and she was laughing. Come on people, it's a drama film, don't make it into a comedy. Where was the dark side of Grey???? oh wait, yes.. in the end.. ""I'm fifty shades of f*** up..."" (roll eyes)<br/><br/>So many cheesy lines, empty looks..bad bad bad sex scenes. <br/><br/>OK, I wasn't expecting to see porn, it's rated R, but have some passion in the scenes, please!! Please!!! In all sexual encounters in the book, Christian talks to Anastasia. Do not put all the dirty talk in the film, but SOME of it. It's important!! The line that he says again and again in the book it's ""You're mine"". WHERE THE HELL WAS THAT???? Oh wait, yes, I heard it.. ONCE!!! And not in a sex scene! <br/><br/>Leaving the theater, all the fans were disappointed.<br/><br/>Terrible screenplay, terrible direction. I don't know if I should blame the actors because it's really the director that leads them. OK, Dornan was obviously bad choice for the role. He didn't want to be in there. Dakota was fine for me. Nothing more, nothing less than I had pictured of Anastasia.<br/><br/>The music and the photography were very good, and that's where my 2 stars are going to.<br/><br/>I really hope they put more effort in the next two films. Fans deserve to see their dark love story as they read it.<br/><br/>Do not forget that it's thanks to them, that this has become a bestseller!!"

At some points you start wondering if you are watching a romantic movie or some cheap porn.The actors were not very good either but who could blame them...this definitely cannot be their dream part.

","The reason for why I liked the movie, is based on the setting itself of the very movie, the dark and mysterious weather and the lightning in the rooms and sky. I think the acting was good, and I really like how the movie pushed itself over the limits of what was okay in movie-making, based on people's opinions. I'm 14, male, and I watched this movie with some male friends and some female friends, and I really enjoyed, and amused myself at how people show disgust of this movie, just because it contains some pornographic material. Where I live, in Oslo, there was even a protest outside Colosseum cinema. I really wanted to provoke them by saying ""I want to be just like Christian Grey when I grow up"", however I saw the movie at a different cinema. I think the movie was good, and I think people would leave better reviews if it was not for the modest pornographic material. And hey, everybody watches porn, right?"

I went with a female friend, who said she enjoyed the movie, so I suffered this torture for her sake. I literally reached a point where I was about ready to start crying from boredom. Even the sex scenes became boring. It was like, don't they do anything else? The whole movie was pointless. We never find out why the characters are motivated to do what they do. They give us 10 minutes of sappy dialogue, then they go have weird kinky sex, which has no passion, then they talk some more, then more weirdo sex, then more talk....you get the picture.

There's no romance in there, no chemistry, just abuse.

"Mr_Ram","6","12","21","15 February 2015"," Immature reviews and misguided judgments
","Rule 101 of reviewing movies: Only reviewers who finish a movie have a right to an opinion of that movie. <br/><br/>The book trilogy is not the movie (and I never read it). What's more, rape and abuse are controversial words and sensitive topics. They also mean non-consent. Both lead characters as presented in the film are highly-vulnerable, consensual adults, utilizing safe words. This film does not promote rape or abuse. If anything, the filmmakers over-stress the consensual nature of Christian's playtime and Ana's intrigue.<br/><br/>It's telling that men - so many of whom are adolescents or under 20 - have ripped this film apart on IMDb, without considering how many women in this world have an interest in, or a fantasy about, Sub roles or BDSM lifestyles. Part of the same anger toward Ghostbusters remake with an all-female cast I believe has a related hatred in Fifty Shades. There's just something about female empowerment that scares so many men.<br/><br/>Fifty is flawed. It's not the best movie ever. And I felt the ending was jarring and awkward. But it's hardly the trash that so many have attempted to throw out. It's a sensual story with complicated themes featuring emotionally vulnerable characters who are pushing each other in directions that neither has experienced before. Consensually."
"bates_carter","1","17","32","14 February 2015"," Disappointment wrapped up in a hot mess with a side of seriously?
","Though I was relatively late to the 50 Shades craze, I eventually read the series and was pleasantly surprised that it was somewhat more to it than just porn between pages of a book. However, I was curious to see how this would be translated into a movie that could be publicly released without an X-rating, yet stayed true enough to the intense sexual-ness that it was more than just a glorified Lifetime movie. Lofty expectations, I'll admit, but still possible I thought. Apparently, I was wrong. I understand people were looking for hot sex scenes because, after all, that is the core of the book. But was it really necessary to completely bypass at least a little plot and character development to get there? Again, apparently yes. It definitely helps to have read the books to get any understanding of what is supposed to be going on, but it is a small consolation after wasting two hours and spending a small fortune in tickets and popcorn. If you are going in blind, meaning haven't read the book, and just looking for some steamy sex scenes to get your motor running, you would be better off streaming free porn on the internet. At least they are honest about what you are getting. It was not the worst movie I have ever seen, though none come to mind at the moment. That being said, the only thing I left with was feeling fairly certain that, if I ever had to, I could pick out Dakota Johnson's naked breasts and buttocks in a police lineup considering how much time we were given to study them throughout the movie. Maybe the next installment should go straight to Showtime or Starz. At least I am already paying for those channels anyway."

"sam-victoria","5","11","19","15 February 2015"," Surprisingly, was not as bad as I anticipated.
","Fifty Shades of Grey was a film that was looked down upon very heavily by movie critics and journals all around the country. Right from the get-go, when the film was announced, people who had read the psycho-erotic book about the man who tortures women for pleasure all knew that revamping the book into a film was going to be a horrendous idea.<br/><br/>The film got very cheesy and boring at times (especially with all the times Christian mentioned that he had to ""go back to Seattle"" because he was confused, or move to some other place because he is a ""monster"" and is incapable of love, and other loads of crap), as well as a bunch of other cringe worthy scenes, like the first time he took off his shirt and randomly leaned in and took a bite of Anastasia's piece of toast. Like can someone please explain to me why(?)...<br/><br/>But with that being said, the film was actually very suspenseful and aroused curiosity heavily many times throughout. The acting was looked down upon by all critics everywhere, and to be completely honest, it wasn't actually that bad. The plot was the one thing that was a bit repetitive and ""back and forth"", but in the end, it was a very interesting story about a man who had a very rough childhood and let his past grow on him into adulthood, making him the quote-on-quote ""monster"" that he is. Not to mention all of the deep erotica scenes were portrayed very well. It was definitely way further from any sort of BDSM pornography I've ever seen, but still managed to show how much of a sexually obsessed monster Christian was. In my opinion the film deserved a 5 on 10 because, much like The Interview (getting a 9 rating in the first 3 weeks of it's release because of biased reviewers), this film needs to be evaluated at a personal standpoint because everyone has different taste in these types of ""unique"" and sort of contrasting types of films. Also make sure you go watch this movie in a packed theater because your experience will be much more enjoyable if everyone is watching it with you right by your side."

","Well, I read all three books. The first two book is kinda filled with lots of steamy stuff but third book is more interesting. Me and my fianc√© had a chance to go at a pre-screening of the movie. And to tell you the truth, this is probably 98% match with the book. People complain no matter what. ""It's not like the book...blah blah...Oh, its like the book. No new material..."" But I say, this is not everyone's cup of tea. I like it because it has sensuality. People think this movie promotes violence. I don't see any violence in here and neither does my fianc√©. These are acts of two adult, consenting to perform BDSM. It is not full on torture to mean and hurt anyone. Again, its not for everyone. So if you don't like it. Stay away of it rather than putting negative comments and confusing people. I understand this can be new to some people and be little uncomfortable but that's what everything new is going to be like.

"agataaliceee","6","5","7","26 February 2015"," One film and so many questions
","What am I gonna do with it? How am I to judge it? This is my first question that I asked myself after watching Fifty Shades of Grey. After leaving a cinema, I could only say: ""chapeau bas"" for those who promoted the film effectively, anyway currently the film brings the financial success, but when it comes to reviews of critics and audiences the situation is much worse.<br/><br/>I am one of the people who have read the Fifity Shades Trilogy, despite its simplicity of language and the use of such obvious ways that cause many women are reaching for the book. Can say that I read the book in one breath, but this is not the type of reading that changes your outlook on life, just something to read for simple entertainment.<br/><br/>I went to the cinema with the hope that the filmmakers would squeeze the best flavors of the whole story. What have we received from the combination of all components?<br/><br/>Initially, I was sitting excited by the fact that just I was watching the most awaited film adaptation of the book in 2015. After 10 minutes the emotions subsided and I had the impression that Anastasia came to do an interview with a young man who accidentally was dressed in a smart suit and seated at a desk in a luxurious office, not with authoritative self-confident and proud of his success in business president of the holding company. In the first minutes of the film the actors seemed ""wooden"", almost like they read their roles, although in my opinion Dakota Johnson coped with the role much better than Jamie Dornan.<br/><br/>Every minute was better but still the number of good scenes could be counted on the fingers of one hand.<br/><br/>Personally, I would prefer that the filmmakers focused on the psychological side of the story and in particular showed internal dilemmas of Anastasia - follow heart, break the desire and pick the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, or think rationally and withdraw from this strange agreement.<br/><br/>Only in the last scene of the film I saw this what I was waiting for - true emotions which became too late. Maybe it was intended effect of the makers so that the audience was hungry and wanted to see more.<br/><br/>Strong advantages of the film are nice shots, good directing, scenography - visually the film feasted my eyes on but unfortunately it lacked that spark. I understand that the story of Anastasia and Christian was shortened on the need to create the script, but the people who did not read the book, may in certain moments of the film wonder what's going on?<br/><br/>Another great advantage of the film is the music which drew my attention, it is well integrated into the image.<br/><br/>I have the feeling that the filmmakers treated us as if we were Anastasia because we want more ‚Äì the true feelings, hearts and flowers. The filmmakers remind me of Christian, who offers us a pleasure on his own terms. And the question is ""What would we get out of all this?"", Christian answers: ""me"", and filmmakers: ""a film just a film"".<br/><br/>Have you lost control?"

I don't think people realize that most movies based from the books usually don't compare to the book. Stop going into it with high expectations like it's going to be exactly equal to the book and just enjoy it. All key points from the book were not in the movie as expected.

","WEll... I did read the books, and I did think they were alright... <br/><br/>What I don't understand is the expectations I had prior to watching the movie. The books are basically about nothing, but Christian and Ana going at it everywhere. And that pretty much sums up the plot of the three parts. There is that minor Leila thing in book two, but that's just ridiculous, so lets not even mistake that for a twist or part of the story line. So in all fairness, it would have been rather surprising had the creators turned this mediocre read into an enjoyable movie. They could have at least tried though...<br/><br/>Spoiler, I think <br/><br/>First thing that irritated me: Christian Grey... I do think that everyone who read the books had their own Christian and Ana imagined, and the creators could not have found a Christian that would have been approved of by every fan, but this guy is... is a joke. He is ripped, I gotta give that to him, but apart from those abs, he does not really have anything else to show for it. He is supposed to be this mysterious guy, that is just so charismatic and so ""grey"" ha ha, that simply thinking of him should make us blush. Instead we have a guy, that looks like an underwear model and is capable of showing absolutely no emotion. <br/><br/>Second thing that irritated me: The complete lack of chemistry between the leads. I actually found Ana to be okay, I mean all she had to was biting her lips and looking innocent. She kind of nailed that part. But whenever these two were in a scene together[ which is like 88% of the movie] it just felt odd. There was no tension, no sparks, none of that romantic bull. Only lip biting. <br/><br/>Third thing that irritated me: We all know, Fifty Shades of Grey is based on a fan fiction, which was based on Twilight. That's fine, I could not care less actually. I did not really like Twilight either. But there was that scene when Ana and Grey went for a walk in the woods. Seriously, I swear I had seen that somewhere else before. The content of their conversation may have been less pg-13 though... There were other similarities to Twilight, which is just plain horrible. <br/><br/>To sum up, it is a film that you might be able to suffer through once, with the right amount of pop corn nearby. I would love to mention something I liked about it, but apart from Eliot being extremely attractive, nothing comes to mind. Grey had a nice apartment... Yep, thats it."

","I was intrigued. I haven't read the book and I probably never will. There must be better fanfiction about the ""plot?"" than the actual novel, written by people who do understand the power play and the complex psychology behind the BDSM world. There is just none of that here. The author didn't do her homework at the time. Wikipedia is just not enough or me or anyone, and probably highly offensive for members of that community.<br/><br/>Storyline aside (nonexistent), I am surprised at what Taylor-Johnson accomplished with such poor base material. There was little she could do to hide the flaws, as some of those are actually inherent to the story itself. (multi-gazillionaire and helicopters? seriously?) But I believe she did a pretty good job and I admire her for it, all things considered. Sam, get the money and run. Or stay to earn more, it's up to you. You are a free individual. Respect.<br/><br/>Dakota Johnson did great work, she gave a strong performance. Those who don't think so probably forget that these characters are quite shallow to begin with. To me, she gave the shy submissive a nuance of playfulness more than appropriate. (I might be biased because she is a cutie pie. OK, she's the only reason I watched this)<br/><br/>The role of the dominant is clearly fantasized over the top of the highest Dubai hotel. Jamie Dornan did what he could. Could have been much better, though. But again, this is not a faithful BDSM representation of sex. This is just extrapolating the kinky side and adding a troubled millionaire with mommy issues to the mix. 0 personality. Grey is not a real person. How to bring a fantasy to life escapes my understanding. Clearly didn't work.<br/><br/>Regardless, I watched it to see what this was all about. I get the fuss. I really do. Many ladies out there who are not sexually satisfied. But there is so much better erotic literature out there that it's painful. The story is sloooow, meaningless and often just plain idiotic. Ladies, raise your vibrators and claim your right to be satisfied. Tell your partners what you want, where to touch you. Communication is the key to pleasure (even with yourself). Something Grey doesn't seem to understand. Regain control. Give up control. Whatever works best. <br/><br/>Anyway, if this film brought you happiness, I'm happy for you. I truly am. That's the goal.

","He're the deal. If you read the books and hated them or it you refused to read the books on principle, then I have no idea why you would see the movie. You are clearly going to hate it. For those I described who saw it? The joke is on you because they have your money now and you have contributed to the monetary success of the film. Congrats, Sparky. <br/><br/>Clearly, this was not a great literary achievement as a trilogy. The writing is poor, Christian has a serious creep factor and Ana was whiny and spineless. However, I think the movie is an improvement on the books. <br/><br/>I didn't hate the books... and while I am not am not turned on by BDSM (and skimmed some of the rougher scenes in the books) the sex wasn't what gave me the ick-factor. It was their relationship outside of the bedroom that seemed borderline abusive to me. However, as I said before, it seems like the movie may have improved upon that a bit as Ana seemed to have some spine, some spunk here. <br/><br/>I was excited for Jamie Dornan as I enjoyed him in Once Upon a Time and I do not find Charlie Hunnam to be attractive in the least. But I found Jamie's performance to be really stiff and awkward...he never felt comfortable in the role. Christian Grey is needs to embody the confident billionaire. Jamie didn't pull that off and it was disappointing. Hopefully he'll loosen up a bit for the next two films. Dakota Johnson, on the other hand, I thought was great. I do think it odd though, considering mostly women will see this, how much nudity there was of Dakota and very little of Jamie. Maybe this was an attempt to bring in the male crowd?<br/><br/>So I give the movie a 6. I thought it did well with the material it had to work with and quite honestly, I thought it kind of hot. As long as you don't take it too seriously as a statement on relationships (I worked at a domestic violence shelter, the books did bother me at times) or care about the accuracy or lack-thereof of the BDSM lifestyle (it is fiction after all), it can be an...interesting...ahem...way to spend a couple of hours."

","Cliff notes is exactly what I put in the summary. It's the best way I can describe it. But if you feel like reading my rambling review. read away I went into this with an open mind knowing partially what the book was about (haven't read it) and came away very disappointed, although I probably shouldn't have been. I just figured something carrying so much hype would be better. It wasn't the worst movie I have ever watched but it is very much below decent.<br/><br/>Although it had brief moments of being humorous and sexy it just didn't work, I found it to be boring, the acting sub-par, I almost think they should've cast Taylor (Max Martini) as Mr. Grey but that's neither here nor there. It was shot well like a big budget movie, they did a good job of showing that Mr. Grey had plenty of money, I think the only thing they did right was the soundtrack.<br/><br/>But I try to remind myself that maybe this is just the women's version of hardcore porn (even in the movie they cut the sound down and crank the music up when the sex scenes come up) just that its toned down to less nudity and less point of view type stuff. You have the rich, handsome, arrogant man chasing after the modest, quiet, passive lady and he shows her so many things. But hey I don't sit back and critique any porn that I watched with oh the acting ruined it or it was unbelievable. I watch it for what it is PORN. So maybe I'm just viewing it from the wrong perspective"

"snaidu422","8","6","9","20 June 2015"," A Tied-Up Viewing.....
","Things out of routine always interest us as they provide us an excuse from the same boring itinerary. So a movie like ""50 SHADES OF GREY"" would naturally pique interest of the general audience as it advertised itself as a movie dealing with sadomasochism (S & M) bondage included and yes! it is based on a bestseller of the same name by E.L. James.<br/><br/>While we jog through the wafer thin plot which mainly deals with the protagonist Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) meeting a business tycoon Charles Grey (Jamie Dornan) while being stand-in for her friend during an interview session. Grey falls for and through what appears as an innocent courtship pulls her into his world of pleasure and pain. He makes it clear that he does not want any emotional attachment (no touching him, no sleeping on the same bed, no dates) and also sends her a copy of an NDA which he expects her to sign.<br/><br/>While Anastasia takes her own time in deciding to sign the contract, she finds herself falling in love with Grey and experiences Grey's weird taste in love making which also involves punishment if she disobeys him during their sessions.<br/><br/>Anastasia soon gets tired of this one sided relationship which is not going anywhere.<br/><br/>Dakota Johnson is excellent as Anastasia Stelle, her innocent charm and most of the child like lines give you the perfect protagonist as against the ""in control"" women in porn flicks. Her performance is noteworthy in scenes when she discusses the contract in depth with Grey and the final outburst.<br/><br/>Jamie Dornan, underplays his character and gives a nod to Dakota Johnson, as the film truly belongs to her. But yes, there is a spark of fine performance especially in scenes where he explains his childhood trauma and the switch from suave businessman into a sadistic lover.<br/><br/>Kelly Marcel's screenplay is fantastic and does not actually dump you with love-making scenes for no rhyme or reason, but actually uses these scenes to actually let the audience have a grasp of how Anasatasia is changing in character and the pain she undergoes emotionally. The screenplay at parts does give you a feeling that what you are watching is nothing but glorified porn, but to Marcel's defense, that's what the novel does on which the movie is based.<br/><br/>Music by Danny Elfman is excellent as always, and adds a little something during the love making scenes which in fact is in sync with the characters emotions during those scenes. The music is what makes this movie different from other porn flicks.<br/><br/>The reason I keep categorizing this movie as porn is because what do you categorize a movie which has 7 minutes of love making scenes every 15 minutes or so? But, we cannot say we were not warned about that? And yes! lot of people walked into cinemas because of that promise......which the filmmakers did not break.<br/><br/>Sam Taylor Johnson's direction is top-notch, giving a classy touch to what could have been just another film with naked bodies. He handled the scenes with the emotional content really well and with a lot of help from Seamus McGarvey (DOP) who used his lens to cover the beauty of Vancouver and giving us a sweep of the Grey world as well as a modest look at the Steele world.<br/><br/>Would I recommend it to anyone? Yes as long as I am sure that the people I am recommending this film to are not sick of S&M, Bondage and other forms of unnatural love making.<br/><br/>I would rate it 4 upon 5"
"jaggedyer","1","7","11","14 April 2015"," Fifty shades of disturbing!
","This is a bad snuff film. There are no redeeming qualities in this movie, the protagonist is a prick the, the girl is stupid and vulnerable. Then comes the the incredibly over-the-line sadomasochism sex scenes. Which by the way, are more like a horrible porn film. How did this even pass an ""R"" rating? I guess the main feature of the film is that she somehow ""changes him"". Which I don't really see depicted and quite frankly is nothing like the book the movie was based on. There is actually nothing I liked about the movie. I think the acting is poor, the character development is poor, the directing is poor. I feel like the creators just made ""cheap shots"" with all nudity and explicit depictions of disturbing sex scenes to compensate for their lack of talent to put together a decent movie."

","I think this movie is most enjoyable for those who HAVE read the book. <br/><br/>Don't think of it as twilight fan fiction, don't think of it as porn. This movie is supposed to be hot and intense, and it is! Some of the scenes surprised me, but in a good way. If you are shy about sex scenes, seeing boobs, or talking about sex, then you probably won't enjoy this movie. <br/><br/>There were some scenes or conversations in the movie that didn't happen in the book or were altered slightly. But, I think that they did a good job at keeping a good balance to being true to the book while also keeping a good pace and interesting dialogue for the movie. <br/><br/>The first sex scene in the red room was my personal favorite and I think they made a great music choice as well as the way they showed the scenes. This movie is slightly more graphic than the average R rated movie, but it's rated ""R"" and not ""NC17"" for a reason. <br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed it and would hardly change a thing about it!"

IMO if people like the book they will like the movie. Dakota did an amazing job of portraying every facet of Ana. Dakota did an amazing job of portraying every facet of Ana. I am a huge Charlie Hunnam fan, actually he is the reason I finally gave in and read the books, I was upset when he backed out and doubted at first Jamie being cast¬ÖHOWEVER after seeing the moving, Jamie is Christian, he brought the stiff, standoffish, cold, older in manner than years Christian from book1 to life, I could see his struggles with realizing he actually felt real emotions about a woman, the struggle with changing for her, staying away from her. Honestly, after watching the movie I can't see anyone else as Christian or Ana. In book 2, Fifty Shades Darker, Christian really starts to evolve and we learn more about him and I can't wait to see Jamie bring FSD Christian to life. The ending had me in tears and I went home and immediately started a re-read of book 2 Fifty Shades Darker. Applause to Jamie Dornan, Dakota Johnson, Sam Taylor-Johnson, Kelly Marcel, EL James and the entire cast and crew for bring Fifty Shades of Grey to life in such a splendid, classy, funny, sexy manner!!!

While I was one of only a few men at the theater, I thoroughly enjoyed the story being told, the acting, and the psychological subplots developed in this film. I had not read the book and went to watch the film with an open mind, and I'm glad that I did. They do a good job developing the characters, and the film was nothing like I thought it would be. Those who are viewing this as simply a sexual film either have not seen the film, or are unfortunately missing the larger questions about love, relationship, and how people show up in this world.

All the people giving it low scores are people who hate the books. And yes I get it, it's a controversial book. But honestly, I knew it was going to be good because I love Jamie Dornan he did a perfect job as Christian. He was sexy and funny. But Dakota Johnson she totally killed it. I expected her to be very serious but honestly, she was funny and she made me laugh. Specially when she called Christan when she was drunk. I do agree that the books are not perfectly written but the movie was so much better and the sex scenes weren't even that uncomfortable to watch. They were limited. Kinky but limited. To me this movie is not about sex. It's a wonderful love story about a girl trying to fix a broken man. And you can see his vulnerability and his feelings. I personally loved it :)"

The overall plot is similar to romances like Pretty Woman and filmed in a quite cold style, but very professionally made and really very similar to the book.<br/><br/>Dakota Johnson has delivered a very nice performance, Jamie Dornan also plays his role quite nicely even though visually he isn't such a good fit to Christian Grey. But the overall romance story flows down very nicely and is fun.<br/><br/>The erotic part has been filmed very nicely, it doesn't show too much but in some scenes there is really some hard whipping and BSDM play. It shows in an interesting way how someone into BDSM tries to introduce someone new to this into this sexual play. Really good performance. Even though some people may claim that this isn't the real way how this looks in real live it's a nice approach. And it has been filmed in a way that it's not too hard, still a bit funny or with the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>So I was positively surprised and cannot understand why there are so many one star ratings."

"Bunuel1976","6","12","22","23 February 2015"," FIFTY SHADES OF GREY (Sam Taylor-Johnson, 2015) **1/2
","Last Friday's theatrical screening of the long-awaited film adaptation of the literary phenomenon that gave rise to the dubious ""Mommy Porn"" subgenre was decidedly the noisiest one I have ever attended: females (who, unsurprisingly, made up the vast majority of the audience) gabbing relentlessly to each other throughout, women talking directly to the screen, another who gagged on her popcorn and a chubby girl who commented out loud that she would not allow anyone to whip her like that¬Öas if any one would ever care to or she would even feel the pain?! I was only vaguely familiar with the novel until mid-2012 when it became a daily topic of conversation among female colleagues at my workplace! Eventually, curiosity got the better of me and I downloaded a .pdf edition of the trilogy (I would not dream of spending money to acquire them legitimately!); the low level of writing on the first book (especially) was even more off-putting than any of its would-be objectionable content turned out to be...but I soldiered on and read through the first and second novel ‚Äì even if by the time the film version came along three years later, I am still stuck in the initial stages of the third book! Anyhow, learning that several of those same female colleagues had decided to attend a screening of the film and make a ""Girls' Night"" out of the event, I cluelessly decided to join their party uninvited...<br/><br/>The millions of fans of the novels worldwide immediately had their own ideas regarding who would be ideal casting for the central roles of disturbed billionaire Christian Grey and plain ing√©nue Anastasia Steele...but, in the end, these fell into the laps of Irish model-turned-actor Jamie Dornan (handsome, sure ‚Äì but even more wooden than any of the instruments of pain/pleasure at his disposal in the infamous ""Red Room of Pain"") and the admittedly beguiling Dakota Johnson (the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, no less); tellingly enough, the latter was invited to present at yesterday's Oscar ceremony but Dornan was not. Nepotism, perhaps (after all, the film was similarly breaking box office records worldwide)...but I do not think so. From the rest of the cast, only two names rang a bell for me, incidentally both saddled with the thankless roles of the parents of each respective protagonist, namely Oscar winner Marcia Gay Harden and Jennifer Ehle. I do not recall if it was like that in the first book as well but I was surprised to see that the major secondary character of ""Mrs. Robinson"" was only whispered about a couple of times but never actually appeared. Indeed, some people seemed surprised by the abrupt ending expecting the film to be a reductive adaptation of the trilogy...as if Hollywood would ever lose an opportunity to take two more trips to this goldmine in the coming years!<br/><br/>While I found nothing all that salacious about the book's copious erotic passages myself (I have been an avid reader of Georges Bataille's novels from 75 years previously after all!), the film's even blander depiction of them is disappointingly tame...so much so that the rumours I had heard that the sex scenes where going to be filmed in silhouette and the fact that it has actually been banned outright in several backward-thinking territories are totally laughable in retrospect. Johnson's small ""mammalian protuberances"" (to steal a phrase from the late great Frank Zappa) get the most mileage but Dornan is not averse to filling up with screen with the occasional close-up of his bare bottom (""a perfect 10"" according to the most adulatory among my female friends ‚Äì who, nevertheless, also took time out to spot a couple of goofs that escaped me and google a difficult word)! But, then, there are no glimpses of blood at all in the film or, come to that, pubic hair during its 15 minutes of sexual content overall!! Needless to say, this was more of a studio marketing ploy to keep the film from being slapped with a forbidding NC-17 rating rather than a case of artistic cold feet on the film-makers' part. Still, as it is, director Sam Taylor-Johnson will remain most notorious in years to come for having married an actor 23 years her junior (Aaron Johnson, of KICKASS fame) than for having helmed the steamy film version of FIFTY SHADES OF GREY!! What with the film hurrying through the narrative and skimping on the juiciest parts...but, thankfully, Christian's irritating habit of tilting his head and Anastasia's cringe-inducing and somersaulting ""conscience"" have been jettisoned!!<br/><br/>It is all the more a pity, therefore, that one learns how director Johnson counts The Velvet Underground's 1967 counter-culture classic debut as one of her favourite albums since what is on display in her own film is worlds apart from the full-blooded BDSM relationship depicted in the shattering ""Venus In Furs"", the song which made me fall in love with this all-time favourite band of mine in the first place! Equally fitting would have been The Stooges' ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" from their own John Cale-produced 1969 debut (incidentally, I got to see Cale live at a London concert in October 2012)...but, at least, we do get The Rolling Stones' 1978 hit ""Beast of Burden"" on the eclectic soundtrack that also features classical pieces and contemporary pop stuff. Just as the literary works did not really break new ground (it just slyly appealed to the lowest common denominator and hit the collective jackpot..or is that G-spot?!), so the film follows in the wake of much older (and much better) films that had tackled the controversial theme of BDSM far more liberally and artistically, among them Mario Bava's THE WHIP AND THE BODY (1963), (my own No. 1 film-maker) Luis Bunuel's BELLE DE JOUR (1967), Henri-Georges Clouzot LA PRISONNIERE (1968), Yasuzo Masumura's BLIND BEAST (1969), Radley Metzger's THE IMAGE (1975), Walerian Borowczyk's LOVE RITES (1988), Roman Polanski's BITTER MOON (1992), etc.!"
"linzyag","8","21","43","14 February 2015"," Why this is a great adaptation for Fifty Shades of Grey
","***Personal post form blog DO NOT COPY**** To start, I have read the Fifty Shades trilogy and I loved the books. I think E.L. James wrote such a unique, fresh, and empowering love story. Anastasia is a strong women who knows who she is. Christian has his issues, but with the both of them together, figuring each other out, helping each other, it's very touching and loving. <br/><br/>For the movie adaptation, I have been following everything about it since the news came out. I've watched the trailers(multiple times), watched interviews, read other reviews. I was going into this movie with a decent level of expectation. This is actually happening! And I have to say that I really did like the movie. <br/><br/>First off, Dakota and Jamie are perfect for the characters. Their chemistry is spot on and I get the feelings that I got from reading the books. Also I think Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel, added what needed to be added to be a great film. I love how Sam brought in the right amount of pleasure for the book lover fans and new people seeing Fifty Shades for a first time. <br/><br/>The colors, scenery, and the whole look of the movie was exactly what I had in my head. From Christian's apartment being the way it was to the floor plan and furniture. And of course the red room was exquisite. The clothing in the movie for both Ana and Christian had both perfect fits for their personalities. <br/><br/>When it came down to the final week and I was looking at early screening reviews, I was getting really aggravated. It is not a law saying that you have to read a book before its a movie, but with book having backlash since the beginning, I think it might have been better. Many reviews from people and news outlets, were writers who haven't read the books and would end up given the movie a bad review, calling it dull, lacking, not kinky enough. And other would just say it was horrible, and didn't like how it was put together. Yes, there were parts missing, but it is an adaptation, you have to give and take to make something standout and be pleasing. Many movie goers can probably say that they get bored with the very typical love stories that are shown in movies, but I think Fifty Shades(book/movie) proves otherwise. Like the stars and makers of this film have been saying, I have never seen a movie like this before. It is fresh, emotional, and is kind of genre-less. Of course there were parts I wished that they added more from the book or elaborated on more, and for the sex, those who have read the books know the sex is hot and kinky. And for this movie to be rated R, showing a lot of nudity, the scenes are still very hot and drawing. <br/><br/>No adaptation of a book can be perfect, but in the end Fifty Shades of Grey was an excellent movie. It was new, it was different, and something fresh to see instead of the usual love story. A great book has become a great movie and I hope other die-hard fans can agree. ***This post is from my blog, please do not copy my work?***"

After I saw the film, I wasn't let down in any way. I knew that they wouldn't be able to add in certain scenes from the book due to the R rating, but other than that they pretty much stayed true to the story. The people who called this ""porn"" certainly haven't seen porn before because the sex scenes were just like any other rated R movie sex scenes. They really weren't that graphic.

Mainly due to its naked nature in the portrayal of passion and sexual pleasures that has been duly debated all over the community. Barring the hatred, one cannot simply ignore the Polished cinematography and sound design that has been provided. The sets, the ambience, the tonality hit the right note in every frame. Moreover the performances by the main two leads, added the professional touch to it.
Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan as Christian Gray shined well.
It takes a lot of courage and a bit of sincerity to say yes to such provocative yet challenging roles. Some credit should go to the director herself as well!
Sam Taylor-Johnson, did a phenomenal job in her own right. She managed to handle all the nuances regarding the above mentioned characters and carefully crafted the odd but sparkling relationship between them. Alas! The same cannot be said about the other roles. Drifting away from the norm, In this abyss of luscious journey; In the hindsight of passion and intense love; the deeper prospects are not profoundly addressed; but a subdued approach is followed. The subtlety sometimes dragged the screenplay a tad bit though. The sensual scenes, the erotic moments; never seemed vulgar. Although the BDSM aspects at times felt borderline abusive. But it depends on an individual's perspective too. As someone might find it pleasurable; others may find it offensive and far away from a rational thing.
The distinctive viewpoints are obvious, But to consider it as a trash is far fetched and nothing but an intentional ignorance. Sexual likings and All these sensitive stuffs are always borderline controversial. These things can easily go awry oftentimes but that doesn't mean it always needs to be under the microscope of criticism and sort of a plaything for the hateful audience."

Extreme gives Christian the strongest ability of control. And control always deal with balancing, thus calmness. If you watched carefully, Christian was so calmed in every scene. Like what he said, that's his way of living.
Ana is the female protagonist of the book, portrayed as being shy and self-conscious. When Christian first meets Ana, she is a student studying English literature at Washington State University, Vancouver and living with her best friend Kate. She is a virgin, and somewhat naive and idealistic in her views of romantic relationships."

It's about a sexual development in a boy that went wrong because of adult intervention. Anastacia feels the deeply wanted need for intimacy that only can be reached by using the behavior styles (dominancy) that was missed during the abusive relationship years ago. A film with great music, great sc√®nes and real outstanding dialogues, no word is said to much and no missing words eather..... A film about relations and holding ones own morale borders and the widdening of the borders because of the caring love for a person with a inner conflict between, love, lust and intimacy."

","for my surprise, i have to defend the movie. i read half of the book a couple of years ago and it was really stupid. i hated it. so i expected the movie to be even worse. but compared to the book, the movie is actually OK. it's watchable and you won't get bored at any time. of course, the whole story is probably stupid and unbelievable and many people will get upset or offended by it. i don't think there's anything to get upset about. the story is slow. this is the first part out of 3, so nothing special happens. the sex scenes are nice, the chemistry is average. the dialogue could have been better, but it could have been a lot worse. the good thing about the movie is, that they could skip some really cheesy parts from the book. i think if there wasn't such a huge advertising campaign around this movie, most people would say, that the movie is OK. but now everyone was expecting something like titanic and got disappointed. i expected something like twilight and it came out better, so 6 stars from me."

The film always had a lot to live up to. But i think they did it well. A few of the scenes jumped through quite quickly without explaining what was happening so I'm hoping maybe when they release the DVD there will be some uncut scenes added or bonus scenes. I think you understand Ana quite well but you miss some of Christians Depth, and how he really feels about Ana. But overall i really did enjoy it, the scenes played well, and were a lot more raunchy than i was expecting. And very funny in places. A great start to the series. I think most people love the second book more so hopefully more detail next time please.<br/><br/>As for Jamie and Dakota, I think they had all the chemistry there, and did it really well. I think the script was more lacking than the actors playing them.<br/><br/>The directing was great and the overall look and feel of the film was great. i think the book to film sets were exactly as they should of been, and felt they kept true to the books.<br/><br/>Great film did exactly what it said on the tin :)"

It was all consensual. The movie itself was really good they followed the book and got most of the key points and there was also a little comedy in there!

"Parexus","1","10","18","26 February 2015"," 50 Shades of Suicide
","Well, I watched it and as per expected it was atrocious. Am I surprised? No. Fifty Shades of Grey was a book that somehow managed to get published and I have no idea how. It's as if the writer was a mom and rummaged on her 14 year old daughters computer and found a sexual fan fiction about some popular YouTuber and changed the names around and edited some of the stuff, made it longer and threw it at a few publishers. It became controversial for the absurd sexual content and a specific tampon scene. The movie takes this story and gives it a massive budget, and throws it on the big screen for you. <br/><br/>What are the good things?<br/><br/>The first hour of this movie is so bad that its actually good and pretty entertaining, the camera-work and soundtrack are honestly not half bad and Dakota Johnson is very attractive. That's honestly everything good I can name.<br/><br/>What are the bad things?<br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey is the worst big budget movie I have ever seen in my entire life. They try and go for subtlety and foreshadow a few things in the beginning but it's done so badly that it calls for a few awkward moments. The acting is sub par at best and the way the characters communicate to each other is ridiculously unrealistic. The first hour may be so bad its good, but the second hour is extremely boring, and it's just hard to watch. This movie honestly gave me anxiety. <br/><br/>""BUT ITS NOT MADE FOR GUYS!!!""<br/><br/>Honestly, I watch a lot of movies and I do watch a lot of movies people would consider chick flicks and have enjoyed some of them. It's such a ridiculously stupid argument. Maybe if you're a girl who doesn't watch very many movies ever and doesn't care about writing or anything like that, then they'll probably enjoy it. Good for you. But this movie if you actually take grasp of the elements that signify whether the movie is good or bad, then this swims deep into the bad side.<br/><br/>Fun fact: The guy who plays Mr. Grey has quit the franchise, seemingly due to his wife not being okay with it. <br/><br/>Should you see this?<br/><br/>If you're curious you can go ahead, the first hour of it would be fun to make fun of with friends because of how terrible it is but the second half is god awful."
"anomis_ananda","1","10","18","26 February 2015"," The biggest paradox in movie history
","Let's start with the fact that this is probably the biggest box office hit. And then add the fact that no matter how many people paid to watch this, it still has a rating of 4,2 here. And then add the fact that 4,2 out of 10 is extremely overrated for this... whatever it is, but it isn't film, since film is art.<br/><br/>I don't know who wrote the screenplay and I'm not even willing to read that much into the crew list, but it was horrendous! Read the books and even though they were written in an exceptionally low class way, I still enjoyed the first one - second and third were a complete pack of bull, containing the same words and lines all over again. This however, even though it kept so close to the book's storyline, was as if my 13 years-old niece had a sudden infantile hormone rush - naive, boring, immature.<br/><br/>The cast was ... no words. Bad acting, bad acting, bad acting. I feel sorry for Jennifer Ehle and Marcia Gay Harden, whom I completely adore, but I just guess that even the greatest of talent can't pull such a BS up - it's a mission impossible.<br/><br/>The director must be brain-damaged, or at least he left me so after seeing this. It looked like a really bad and cheap melodrama - something that would be aired on a very unpopular TV network, to fill the gap at 2 pm, when everyone is taking an afternoon nap.<br/><br/>Who was the editor?! Does that person have Taurette syndrome*?! There was this strange jumping from scene to scene, cut here - paste there, as if he and the director were on some serious drugs! It's like the editor had no idea what he was doing, having an involuntary reaction of his muscles to line up certain scenes. Or maybe it was a kid who did this, or maybe they used Icq to do it...<br/><br/>The plot was definitely something I would like to discuss. I know I've said I liked the first book, and it really didn't look this bad when I imagined it rolling in my head, as I was reading it. But what was the idea with the entire concept of a timid girl, that has to get a crazy rich dude, who's actually a sadistic nutjob, and tame him?! That guy was bad news since the moment they met, with the entire obsession he rushed into tracking her down and sticking up to her behind. Then, we get to the point, where she's practically begging him to beat the hell out of her, which ends up being 6 hits with a whip on her butt, and she then decides he's the worst guy ever and cries her eyes out?! What's wrong with you, girl? You didn't have enough brain to think this through and now it's his fault for being invited to smear your make-up? Not to mention the speed this entire thing evolved since the beginning...<br/><br/>I wonder if I write a bad fanfic of this low-standard piece of literature/motion picture, would it become a bestseller and a box office hit?<br/><br/>It's not that I want my money back, as much as I want those 2 hours of my life back. That was such a waste... To be honest, I'd give it a 0 if I had that option, but let's say I'm giving a 1 for the effort and work of the entire crew - they still had their time devoted, even if the result was such a disappointment. Why did I watch it? Curiosity. Curiosity killed the cat. It killed me too.<br/><br/>*No offense on people with Taurette syndrome - just using it as a metaphor."
"scrapmetal7","1","10","18","22 February 2015"," A Dull Film that does Nothing Right
","This movie has several problems and almost no virtues. Let's just go down the line. <br/><br/>1. It's boring. No matter what a movie is about, there is no excuse for being boring. This movie in particular, which is supposed to be so hot and erotic, should be engaging. It is not. The filmmakers' sole mission was to get people into the theater, but they felt themselves under no obligation to entertain them once they were there. Once the tickets are bought, mission accomplished. You are not in good hands here.<br/><br/>2. Jamie Dornan. Little Jamie Dornan, who is trying to portray an uber-confident, menacing, Nietzchean superman, just has no way to pull it off. With his boyish wave of sunny curls, he seems like he could play a farmer's hardworking son in a period piece, or an innocent young sailor like Billy Budd, or maybe an earnest young priest in an episode of Murder She Wrote. Christian Grey was supposed to radiate sexual menace. Jamie Dornan radiates kinda wanting to ask you to a prom. (It also doesn't help that he is very short). Grey is supposed to be serious and commanding, but when Dornan tries to be this character he just sounds like a robot. He would be an excellent choice to play C-3PO in the Star Wars revival because he's definitely got the moves, but if he'd have to work on giving his voice some personality. <br/><br/>3. Christian Gray. This character makes no sense. He sets all these rules on this woman he's trying to court, but that's really it. That's all he does. He thinks up rules and gets her to come to his house. Because of the awkward flow of the movie this makes even less sense, because he sets these rules and then breaks them, but still acts like they're inflexible. Maybe this makes more sense in the books, but I will never know. He is also a big douchebag. There's no other way to describe him. Ana drunk-dials him and his reaction is so dorky and lame that it would be great comedy if it were intentional. ""Have¬Ö have you been DRINKING???"" Uh¬Ö. OK¬Ö.. Then he shows up at the bar and angrily flexes on the most harmless character in the movie as if either of them were badasses of some sort¬Ö It's a moment that really just falls flat.<br/><br/>4. Anastasia Steele. The character, not the actress. Anastasia is a frumpy cipher who works in a hardware store and is pursuing a useless degree. You know the phrase ""she basic""¬Ö. well, she basic. The only thing I can figure out about her is that her lack of personality or motivation makes her non-threatening to other women. As long as she is nothing and has accomplished nothing, none of the women readers feel as if she reflects badly on them.<br/><br/>5. The visuals. This is a bleak, joyless, sterile movie. A movie that is supposed to be sensual and erotic should be something you can't take your eyes off of, but this movie is almost challenging to watch. Everywhere they go, inside or outside, looks like the inside of either a clean or a dirty bucket. Also, the movie spends way too much time in closeup on the leads. I got really tired of their boring, expressionless faces.<br/><br/>6. The supporting characters. Anastasia's friends are just supposed to be pieces of a support structure that holds her up for us to like¬Ö but the problem is that they are actually more interesting and likable than she or Christian Gray. Eloise Mumford plays Anastasia's roommate Kate, and she is supposed to be superficial and shallow, but supportive. The problem is that Eloise Mumford is more interesting and fun than anything else in this movie. She lights up the screen whenever she's on. Anastasia has a young suitor named Jose, who is a photographer and likes her a lot. He's actually a little too good for her, but she friendzones him rather mercilessly. He does give Christian Gray an opportunity to act like a douchebag in a very funny scene though. She also works with a nice young guy at the hardware store. He is easygoing, friendly and supportive, and is also interested in her for some unfathomable reason. She can't stand him. Well, the guy is tall. Really tall. Tall for women is like big boobs and blue eyes for men¬Ö. There's no way she would physically prefer little Jamie Dornan over her tall co-worker.<br/><br/>7. Story. Ultimately, the movie can not possibly succeed because the story is just so stupid. The fetish/BDSM elements are shoehorned in so awkwardly and they never, ever work at all. The story would make more sense without the dungeon and the contracts. Those aspects are really just obvious metaphors for Gray's sexual impotence. Not very sexy at all.<br/><br/>8. Dakota Johnson. Well, she basic. They really would have been better off giving this to Sasha Grey. She could have livened it up considerably and wouldn't have been nearly as dull.<br/><br/>Funny side note... after I wrote this I noticed that it was my 51st movie review on IMDb!"
"streamofstars","7","25","54","12 February 2015"," Not as bad as everyone is saying
","Fifty Shades of Grey is directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, with the screenplay by Kelly Marcel, based on the novel by E.L. James. I haven't read the book, so I have nothing to compare it to. I've seen the book reviews and read the hype and it made me curious. So after seeing the film, I've come on here to find a very low rating and I'm quite surprised. It is definitely better than what many are saying.<br/><br/>The film is beautiful to look at. The directing, cinematography, and production design is stylish and polished. I think Sam Taylor-Johnson does an amazing job. Dakota Johnson is wonderful as Anastasia Steele. She is innocent yet sexy, playful but strong. Jamie Dornan is fantastic as the handsome, tormented businessman, Christian Grey. He is serious and intense, and is everything I'd imagined Christian to be. Both actors, besides being ridiculously good looking, do a fine job and play off each other well. They are definite stars of the future.<br/><br/>The love story part is realistic and romantic. Anastasia being in love for the first time, is swept off her feet by Christian but also feels emotional and confused about her feelings for him. The sex scenes are tastefully done, but I was actually expecting more explicit scenes from the way some people went on about them.<br/><br/>It's disappointing and unfortunate that it's getting such bad reviews, because there's many more films out there that are much worse than this. It's got a little bit of everything. Drama, romance, sex, humour, and a killer soundtrack. What more do you want? And as others have said, go see it with an open mind. It's not an award winning film, and the story itself is pretty clich√©d, but overall I really liked it."
"Lacrimosa_Rose","9","16","32","14 February 2015"," Unashamed to say I loved it
","There's some really beautiful cinematography in this film and an amazing soundtrack to back it up. Characters are all fairly true to the novel and where the book was a little cringe- worthy to read the film is beautifully clean and well made. The scene where Christian and Ana are flying over Seattle in the helicopter was partially good in my opinion and paired with Ellie Goulding's 'Love Me Like You Do' made the sequence particularly emotional and brought tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>I think the casting was well done as well; Jaime Dornan is very easy on the eyes and plays the part of an aloof, intimidating businessman extremely well whilst Dakota Johnson lends herself well to the quiet, yet appealing, college student. I think some aspects of the book could have been better developed in the film, such as Christian's relationship with his family, but I'm sure that we will see much more of that in the two film yet to come. One thing that annoys me is the response of certain individuals who have watched it;<br/><br/>It's annoying that so many people are calling 'rape' over this film. Um, NO - every sexual act within the film is consented to by both parties which, as far as I am aware, does not constitute the allegations that Ana was raped. Yes, Christian is violent towards her and has some unusual tastes. But consensual BDSM is not rape. And BDSM is not necessarily conveyed int he right light in this film. But it is a film nonetheless - just one facet, one view, of the world. And if you thought that last scene was shocking you should go and read the book. It's worse. <br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey doesn't romanticise violence. It is one element in a complicated storyline of how two individuals learn to overcome their past troubles and differences in taste.<br/><br/>Enjoyed the books, loved the film and would definitely recommend it."

I can tell they cut out a ton of material from the book, but I still enjoyed the story, and I understood the reasons for Christian's behavior and tastes. I get it. It didn't seem far fetched to me. Dakota Johnson by the way did a FANTASTIC acting job. I was pleasantly surprised by that. Yes, there's lots of sex in it. I'm not sure why it didn't get an NC-17 rating because it is so explicit, yet I loved it. I did not feel like I was watching a porno. There are a couple of lines that are super cheesy, but that is because they went off of the book script and the author is so bad. All in all, I really liked the movie! It made me want to get the next book to see what happens, but I'm not sure I can stand that 1st grade level writing."

"bebebets","9","18","37","13 February 2015"," Don't listen to the Critics
","The critics are not the targeted audience. This movie was intended for the fans and it delivered. I went to the movie last night, one day before the actual premiere and I must say I enjoyed it immensely. The audience was 98% women, no surprise. (If men were smart they'd be at the movie theater;) since it was all women.) Every one of us left the movie giggling, talking about how awesome it was and that we just can't wait a year to see part 2. I read all the books and it was definitely true to the books. I'm sure the fact that E.L.James was a co- producer helped. The casting was brilliant. All of the actors embodied the characters so well. The general consensus at the theater was that Dakota Johnson was surprisingly really good in her role of Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey, well he was just perfection personified. Another surprise was that there were some quite funny & witty moments.There were also some intense moments where you could literally hear a pin drop. I would personally like to thank E.L.James for choosing those amazing jeans Christian wears, Omg, sexy doesn't even describe it! I disagree wholeheartedly with the critics who say there is only 20 minutes of sexy scenes. The entire movie has undertones of sensuality and the scenes that do include steaminess are beyond spectacular and fulfilling and honestly quite racy. Dakota is absolutely stunning in her unabashed nakedness and Jamie, hold on... pause for breath, Jamie is simply GLORIOUS. With regards to the boardroom meeting, critics have said it was laughable and that there was no actual sex. I completely disagree; subtlety and the use of words can be one of the most enticing and erotic things one can experience. It gently guides the imagination to explore the unseen. It's one of the reasons readers enjoy books because it's not all there in front of you, it allows you to interpret it on a more personal level. One of my favorite scenes was the first time they have sex, Wow,wow, wow. That was so hot! Jamie, I was in love with you before, now I'm obsessed ;)<br/><br/>Of course the Red room scenes were pretty sensual as well. If I were rating this movie solely based on entertainment value, I would have given it a 10+. I gave the movie a 9 out of 10 mostly for technical reasons. I am no expert, but I would have enjoyed a few more things. I would have liked the music (which is brilliant by the way) to have been louder, more intrinsic to the movie. I know the movie has ""shades of gray"", maybe that was intentional, but I would have liked more color. The screen lacked a bit of luster, color & vividness which I think would have brought out the scenes more.I also would have enjoyed the famous quotes of the movie like ""laters baby & you are mine"" to have been more pronounced, more audible, instead they were whispered. However the audience was looking for those phrases, most of us sighing when we heard them. I also wish the pace wasn't quite as hurried, but then again it is a movie and there are time restrictions. I guess in the end it all felt like it went so fast because we were all glued to the screen. With that said, if you are a fan of E.L.James' books, Run to the theater. It was definitely worth the wait!"
"audaxego","9","20","42","13 February 2015"," Haters, stay home.
","I hardly ever write reviews but the scores and ignorant reviews for this movie annoy me.<br/><br/>First point; if you didn't like the books then REALLY don't bother watching the movie because they really stuck to the book. Actions or thoughts are not explained better in the acting than they are the book so save yourself the trouble and please DON'T write reviews as they're not relevant to fans.<br/><br/>I saw the movie in a packed theatre yesterday and loved it! Fanning made Anastasia a witty, funny character with personality and that was my biggest fear. That she might've been portrayed as a Twilight's Bella again; flat and boring. Dornan performed well but the first scenes didn't draw me in as much as I wanted to because the tension wasn't built well. The pace was a bit too quick compared to the book. From the moment she gets to his place I think it starts building up better.<br/><br/>Dornan did his best. I saw him act in 'The Fall' and 'Flying home' and I'm sure he knows how to act. His American (fake) accent didn't bother me much, he was bossy and pushy enough to a point where it bothered me less than it did in the book. Would Bomber have been a better choice? When it comes to looks, maybe but I'm not complaining. The casting for Elliot and Taylor were fine, Mia/Rita Ora's overacting bothered me.<br/><br/>The sex is definitely present. In a full (European) theatre there was an utter silence during all that (almost) full nudity. But hey, not complaining. It definitely gave me more than what I expected in that area. These are 2 people who consent in doing this, so let's skip the 'rape' drama. As these books sold over 100 of millions I'm guessing this is exactly what so many people fantasize about.<br/><br/>All in all great romantic movie with a European feel because of the elaborate sex scenes. What bothered me was the chopped ending that made me think about 'The Hobbit'. To chop it off like that was unnecessary since the second book provides enough matter to make an interesting story.<br/><br/>Enjoy this guilty pleasure and don't feel bad about it. The fine soundtrack that starts with 'I put a spell on you' doesn't hurt either. Definitely a movie made aimed to please."

"pthef","3","15","30","13 February 2015"," Disappointing
","I went to see this without any particular expectations. I heard the sound and fury all over the social media from fans who loved the book to people saying it was all about rape and abuse. I saw it, ironically, in that grey area. It starts out (and continues through much of the movie) with some romantic-comedy elements, funny parts that a couple times had me laughing aloud. But it was also, in many ways, formulaic. How many times do we need to tell the story of Prince Charming romancing the pauper girl, after all? I think we all saw ""Pretty Woman"" in the ago. We all read and/or saw ""Cinderella."" It's been done too many times. Come up with something fresh already, for God's sake.<br/><br/>Now, I didn't see anything I would fairly call ""abuse"" in the movie. There were several sex scenes in it, a few spankings, and a lot of teasing. Christian was going on all the time about her consent and I don't recall an event of him treating with her outside her consent, which she always gave him. Anastasia was, pardon my French, prick-teasing Christian throughout the movie, and Christian was trying to purchase her affections. I'll also say the whole sub-theme of anyone with alternative sexual predilections being portrayed as psychotics or trauma-mommas is also overdone, and it misleads people about what's honestly a big segment of peoples' sexuality, and I find that hatred of S&M practitioners to be prejudiced and sad. I won't spoil the movie for those wanting to see it, but it ends, I thought, with Anastasia being the emotionally abusive one, and as the final credits rolled, I decided I had fondness for neither character, thinking they deserved one another so nobody else had to be saddled with them. They were both bleeding assholes earning none of my empathy. In all, FSOG tried and failed. Save your money and see something else."

"without-regretts","8","17","35","15 February 2015"," Build your own opinion before hatred is spread!
","Yesterday on valentines day I watched this movie with my wife because she was so thrilled about it since the first news spread the internet about it. The whole cinema hall was packed. We needed to buy the tickets weeks before the movie even premiered. To some research this movie is now sold out in most of the cinemas here for the next days completely. But enough about those facts. <br/><br/>Because I expected this hype and in the end the only surprise I experienced was that I really enjoyed this movie. I never took care about this hype of it because which dude really takes care about just a flick in general. But my wife told me this and that and because we always do anything together I watched it with her. But like I said I really enjoyed it. But believe it or not the sex scenes weren't the reason why I enjoyed it for me they were more a less a means to an end. But I found the actors very entertaining, the chemistry was nice and Greys character was just ""WTF"" in so many ways (wouldn't work in real life) but it was so strange that it was entertaining on the other hand. Because normally you don't see people talking like that with each other. In some ways it was fresh and new. And in the end of the movie I really wanted to know what the heck is wrong with him, what happened to him, why is he like he is and what about here? I really wanted to see the next movie immediately and I think this is what a good movie is all about even with a topic like this. <br/><br/>And like many others said. Most of the people are just trolling around and sometimes I really hate it that nowadays everyone can say what they like on the internet even if they don't know anything about anything. I was always the type of person that I tried before I build myself an opinion and not the other way around. <br/><br/>In the past I didn't get the Harry Potter hype then I watched it now I like it. I didn't get the Bollywood hype then I watched some and liked some. And the same with this movie. You don't have to like the movie or the original books but please before you spread your opinion through the internet build yourself a own opinion and read the books or watch this movie first then you can say or write whatever you like. But knowing nothing and writing anything isn't smart at all. <br/><br/>Because even if you do not like the subject many do otherwise the whole thing wouldn't be such a success. And if you just don't like and don't want any business with it then why do you infest so much time into writing hate / dislike threads about something you don't like instead of putting the same amount of energy into something you love.<br/><br/>Last but not least. I really enjoyed the story didn't care much about the sex scenes instead of some teenage guys behind our seats ;). But if you put all those hatred beside this is a story about an abused guy who can't handle himself and who hates is personality so much to block every deep feelings out of his system even realizing that this isn't even possible anymore since he found her. Behind all this sexual topic there is a huge love story and a character who is struggling because of his disturbing past. And this is the fact I like about this story."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","12","23","15 February 2015"," Fifty Shades of Zzzzzzz
","It is sort of a sad commentary that Fifty Shades of Grey is threatening to become the perennial erotica of the 21st century. At a time when nudity and four-letter words have made their way onto basic cable and the internet provides free porn 24/7, here is a commercial product that offers steamy sex that is ‚Äì in a word ‚Äì quaint. You go in expecting something hot and spicy but if you put it on the Scoville Scale it would barely register above a bell pepper.<br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey is, of course, the adaptation of E.L. James' phenomenal best seller, a mediocre book that was born as fan fiction and, truth be told, stayed at that level. The good news, however, is the she can take comfort in the fact that the book turned out much better than the movie. The book, while mediocre as erotica, not only contained steamier sex scenes but explained great chunks of the story that the movie fatally leaves out. It also had a grip on the idea of the dom/sub relationship, what the roles are, and how the agreement is arranged. The movie uses them as a punchline.<br/><br/>The story is really just the old claiming-of-a-young-girl bit. We meet a young college student named Anastasia Steele (played by Dakota Johnson, the product of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) who meets-cutes a billionaire (who doesn't?) named Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) after conducting an awkward interview with him that peaks his curiosity. They fumble around with pleasantries and end up on a date that ends up at his home wherein he offers a deal that she will become his submissive. He, you see, is into S&M and has had a series of girls through his home that he convinces to sign a contract that, for a time, make them his submissive. He can have sex with her (of which he has plenty) and he can dominate her, but he can't love her (awww!) She falls in love with him and the complications over his stone heart become the fulcrum of their problems.<br/><br/>I've actually described the plot much better than the movie does. It fumbles in fits and starts, until their sexual relationship kicks into gear, and even then the sex scenes never feel organic to the plot, they feel more like intermissions. Yes, the sex is plentiful, but it is presented in that soft-lit, heavily edited Playboy video sort of way with lots of music that makes you realize that no one had any real interest in pushing the envelope. The nudity remains tightly at an R-rating, the breasts and the backsides (mostly hers) are plenty, but anything else is seen in a fleeting glance ‚Äì which actually might be a plus since the movie is being shown in IMAX.<br/><br/>But somewhere in between the mating rituals, the characters have to interact, and here's where the movie finds its fatal flaw. While Dakota Johnson gives a very natural performance, Jamie Dornan plays the key role of Christian Grey as just terrible. He's a block of wood. He has no screen presence, and he recites dialogue in a monotone like he's reading it from cue-cards. The scenes in which he's supposed to dominate Anastasia feel awkward because he doesn't seem in control ‚Äì it almost seems like she's dominating him. He almost seems afraid of what he's doing. It doesn't help that the key moment when Christian is suppose to explain why he can't love Anastasia ‚Äì which was in the book ‚Äì is missing.<br/><br/>My ultimate reaction to Fifty Shades of Grey was boredom. Here's a story about a woman experiencing sexual adventure, but the movie is so tame that it seems kind of pointless. When you think of all the great sexual adventures on screen Last Tango in Paris, Nine and a Half Weeks, Fatal Attraction, Shame, Secretary (a much better movie about a dom/sub union) you realize that this is a movie that talks a good game but when it takes the game to the field, it isn't ready to go all the way."
"shawneofthedead","4","19","40","12 February 2015"," Fifty shades of dull, though not as dreadful as you'd expect.
","Few movies come with more baggage than Fifty Shades Of Grey. The bestselling book on which it's based has been criticised for everything under the sun: destroying literature, shaming women, and completely bungling the portrayal of BDSM. The film itself, though outfitted with a female director (Sam Taylor-Johnson) and writer (Kelly Marcel), has come under fire from various women's rights and religious groups, all pleading for it to be boycotted upon release. Articles about how stars Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson can't stand each other have gone viral. It's hard for any movie to struggle free of so much controversy, but you have to give the filmmakers credit for trying. The final film isn't, strictly speaking, very good, but - in doing away with some of the more odious elements of the book - becomes surprisingly watchable.<br/><br/>One fateful day, literature student Anastasia Steele (Johnson) takes the place of her sick friend to interview up-and- coming young billionaire Christian Grey (Dornan). They're instantly drawn to each other: Ana can't stop thinking about him, and Christian can't stop himself from seeking her out. But it soon becomes clear that their relationship won't be, as Ana hopes, a ""normal"" one. Keeping himself at an emotional distance, Christian reveals that he would like Ana to consider an unusual sexual request: he wants her to consent to be his submissive, to allow him to control everything about their physical relationship within the walls of his ""playroom"".<br/><br/>There are a few things that do work about the film. In the book, the character of Ana feels trapped - not just in an unbalanced relationship with a creepy guy, but by E.L. James' awkward and frequently laughable prose. Shorn of an inner monologue about her sexual awakening that's liberally peppered with phrases like ""Oh my"", ""Holy cow"", and ""inner goddess"", Ana actually becomes a welcome focal point for the movie. She may be dangerously drawn to Christian, but she also seems to maintain a fairly strong sense of self - she constantly questions why their relationship needs to be precisely as he dictates, without any concessions to the way she would like things to be.<br/><br/>As a result, Fifty Shades plays with a little more romance and feminism than you might expect. It's here that Taylor-Johnson and Marcel's influence on the film really asserts itself. There's an occasional burst of fizzy humour in the way in which Ana and Christian interact, particularly when they are (literally) negotiating the terms of Ana's sexual contract in his icily professional meeting room. Ana is the one with the upper hand in this scene, and many others - she's guarding rather than giving up her freedom. After all, as some have argued in defense of Fifty Shades, Ana has every right to decide how she wants to be treated in the bedroom - even if that means having her hands tied up above her head and being spanked when she disobeys a direct command.<br/><br/>Ironically, what works rather less well is the film's constant and strangely dull focus on sex. Presumably, the allure of kinky, alternative sexual practices was what contributed to the success of James' book. There's plenty of nudity here, with gags, whips and cuffs galore, and it's certainly one of the most explicit films ever made by a big Hollywood studio. But it barely conjures up any sort of genuine tension: sexual, erotic or otherwise. The plot, such as it is, flags frequently, clearly unable to bear the weight of a two- hour running time.<br/><br/>There's also the rather troubling problem of Christian Grey. Try as she might, Taylor-Johnson can't completely excise or explain away the more questionable aspects of his character. It's in the book, after all, and so it's replicated - rather unfortunately - in the film. Christian's intensely specific demands are meant to be rooted in his difficult childhood, but the psychology breaks down after a point. In the second half of the film, especially, Christian feels less like a dangerous romantic prospect than an obsessive stalker. He turns up in Ana's home after she's placed plenty of distance between them, and sends her a flurry of desperate e-mails demanding that she look over her contract.<br/><br/>This is the film that will make - or possibly break - the careers of its two lead actors, both relative unknowns who are now, for better or worse, enormous movie stars. Johnson acquits herself very well: she lends Ana a tremulous charm but also a feisty spirit that suggests she won't give in except when she really wants to. Everything about this film is a tough line to walk, particularly her character, but Johnson navigates her way quite effectively through her copious nude scenes and clunky dialogue.<br/><br/>Dornan doesn't fare as well. Perhaps he was never really comfortable with what he's called ""heinous"" sex scenes, but he's an almost magnificently blank presence here - both in and out of the bedroom. He's so stiff - and not in the naughty sense of the word - that he seems dead inside. That might be intentional, to some extent, given Christian's stubbornly closed-off nature. But it means that he never quite conjures up the right chemistry with Johnson.<br/><br/>Apart from fans of the series (and even they had their doubts), there weren't many people expecting great, good or even mediocre things from Fifty Shades. It seemed to be headed for horror: a dreadful adaptation of a dreadful book, an offensive joke played on the world at large. Well, it's not quite as bad as that. The film is problematic and unforgivably dull in parts, given its subject matter, but anyone turned off by the very thought of it might find themselves surprised by how watchable it is (most of the time, anyway). It's certainly a better adaptation than the book deserves - and that's really a minor miracle for a film struggling beneath the weight of so much controversy."
"park94","9","26","58","14 February 2015"," Captures the story
","I loved the books, all three. The story of Ana and Christian captured me completely. After seeing the reviews and rating given to the film I went to be disappointed. How wrong I was, within the first five minutes of watching the film I was captured again. I didn't move for the next two hours. It had warmth and humour,tension and emotion. Seeing Jamie as Mr Grey when cast I wasn't sure but will they ever find a Mr Grey to push everyone buttons. But he played Mr Grey brilliantly, he had all the facial expression you needed to know what he was thinking. But for me it was Dakota, she was excellent. Ana was funny and loving but so strong and in control. If you loved the books you won't be disappointed. I will be seeing it again and very soon. Can't wait for Darker and Freed!!"
"missallysunshine","10","24","53","14 February 2015"," O.o I don't get all the negative reviews...I will be going to see the movie again
","Maybe Spoilers here!<br/><br/>I went to see the movie today and was a little afraid after seeing the rating. But as a hardcore Fifty Shades of Grey fan I was ready to jump in and give it a try.<br/><br/>So I will be quick with my points<br/><br/>~ Dakota Johnson..Stunning..she was cute..charming...and classy she brought Anastasia Steele to life in front of me just the way I had pictured her from reading the 3 books.<br/><br/>~ Jamie Dornan...yes his accent came through sometimes but I didn't notice it enough to make a big deal of it like some people are seeming to. His acting to me was great, his body language perfect, his look is amazing, he is a stunning man and a great actor. Too me he was intense, intimidating and kept me begging for me. <br/><br/>~ The sex...was wow...kept me on my seats. I was a little afraid about seeing the red room in person and I thought they did it tastefully and to me it wont scare away people who have not read the books. <br/><br/>~ Chemistry...who says they don't have Chemistry? or that the actors hate each other? You even see in the interview where they said Jamie would cover her up, they obviously have to care about each other and I never see any bad vibes between. Their chemistry in the movie was great, something most women are gonna be dreaming of having.<br/><br/>~ It followed the books perfectly without being boring. They added their own flare to scenes to keep it from feeling like it was read straight out of the book.<br/><br/>~ The ending was done just the way I imagined, it leaves us open and wanting for the 2nd film especially for anyone who hasn't read the books. My mother went with my group and she has never read a page of the books. But she left the theater wanting to know when the 2nd movie was coming out so she could know what happens to them. <br/><br/>~ I expected there to be many haters of this movie, and its not going to be every ones cup of tea but I believe that its going in the right direction and the 2nd and 3rd movie will have more variety as anyone who has read the books knows where the plot goes. We can focus on romance/sex/ and then add some action in there and suspense.<br/><br/>~ I love Dakota and Jamie. I hope they don't go through reading these and be to hard on themselves. They did a great job, so let them ignore the crap reviews and realize the real fans are here to support them!! <3 <3 <3"

","The first and most important thing I can say is I wouldn't be proud to say I produced this film. Although the acting was faultless the content of the film was awful. There are big chunks of the book that are missing and I left the cinema feeling let down. As someone who enjoyed the books I would advise reading them rather than watching the film. Dakota Johnson's performance is amazing and she fits the role of Miss Steele well but the production let her down. I am guessing that a squeal is on the cards as there is a lot of content that is not explained. Definitely would not recommend paying cinema prices to watch this film because I regret doing it myself."

The acting is terrible, and there is no chemistry between Dakota and Jamie, I don't think Jamie suited Christian and Dakota was just bad. It didn't work. I cannot believe the amount of the book they have left out! Also they have added scenes that don't even exist in the book but also add nothing to the film. They have also changed some scenes which makes no sense at all as again these scene do not make the film any better if anything they make it worse. I have read all 3 books and really enjoyed them, the film however will not make my top 10! Xxx"

"deltaforce7","1","8","14","1 March 2015"," 50 reasons not to watch this garbage
","This movie might have been somewhat better, but its producers and directors did everything in their power to ruin the whole useless thing even further. They could've made a movie about a dumb girl with a pointless go-nowhere education, go-nowhere job who found herself in this Ersatz-Cinderella sort of story where the Prince turns out to be a monster and so on. But this is where the makers of this flop show how lost they are and how they have no idea what to do with this sorry piece of pseudo- literature. The only one minor redeeming value of this movie is the depiction of the main female characters. Both female roommates are shown as rather brainless whores one of whom finds herself stupidly confused while trying to figure out a difference between mindless whoring, prostitution, and romance. So, this Ana character keeps slowly and boringly contemplating how should she prostitute herself out to this sicko guy, although with all her dumb drinking and with her being just a loose girl she might not even remember who did what to her, when and where (getting educated but not getting smarter is what plagues her). But I am afraid that I am inadvertently making this awful movie sound more interesting than it really is. Because truthfully, this is a slow-dripping, boring, pointless crap. No, it is not really ""sick"". It doesn't explore any ""dark sides of human nature"", since the characters appear so 2-dimentional and uninteresting. No, it is not sexy. There is no attraction between the main characters and they are dull to watch. No, it is not in any way more dramatic than a wet sponge. No, there is no interesting dialog in this movie. No, there are no unexpected plot twists. Is there any plot there at all? I didn't notice any, really. No, there are no valuable lessons that could be learned from any of this. Truly, this ""50 shades"" thing is an empty shell of a movie based on an empty shell of a book made for empty shells of women. I just can't imagine a non-brain-dead person watching this travesty. Hollywood proves one more time that there are more than 50 ways to produce garbage that can still be sold, re-used, thrown out and re-sold again as long as there are ""consumers"" out there who would buy any annoyingly-marketed trash."
"alwaysdewright","1","8","14","25 February 2015"," Awful. Just, so, horribly awful
","Let's get it out of the way: 50 Shades of Grey is one of the most laughable pieces of garbage I've ever sat through. I'll admit I read the first book, so I knew the quality (or lack of quality) the screenwriter would be working with to turn this joke of a story into a film. But honestly they could have produced something decent, at the very least tried to make it artistic or potentially thought provoking. The Secretary or 9 1/2 Weeks covered similar themes, and they seem poetic compared to this. In the end it's a mess, a boring slog of a mess that drags on and on until it climaxes with a tiresome yet lackluster ending (Really? That's the worst you want to do to her? Snooze...). No spoiler here: the movie ruins itself.<br/><br/>Let's talk about acting. For all the hoopla, I really don't see the draw of Jaimie Dornan or why he is in movies. Yeah yeah, I should watch The Fall. But really, he used to be a model? Is that why he's here? I love how much people are fawning over his workout regime, like, Wow! He did sit-ups and drank protein shakes to get a 6-pack, that's crazy. Honestly, for someone trying to be ""The epitome of male beauty,"" he looked mediocre at best. I know all the lonely house-moms who've been waiting anxiously to personify their dirty little fantasies into an actual human being are dripping wet for this guy. But seriously, never once did I find myself have any emotion toward Dornan or think, ""Now that's an attractive man."" If anything I couldn't get past his stupid mouth, how it would crumple like a wilted sprig of ivy any time he tried to make sounds come out and hide his accent. And that's the true failure of this film. It wasn't the few sex scenes or the whips or floggers that made me or the audience uncomfortable. It was EVERYTHING ELSE.<br/><br/>Watching 50 Shades reminded me of watching a sequel that went straight to DVD. IMDb says the actors learned all their lines in 5 days. That's really not shocking. The dialog consisted mostly of, ""Hello Anastasia,"" ""Hi Christian,"" ""Did you consider the contract Anastasia,"" ""I'm still thinking about the contract Christian,"" ""How about now Anastasia? Have you considered the contract now Anastasia?"" ""Maybe in a bit Christian."" I felt like I was being forced to watch two people with no idea how to flirt or function in society try to reason through installing an Ikea bed using only their feet. ""How will we put the boards together Christian? Should we use a screwdriver?"" ""Yes, Anastasia [*furrows brow, stares blankly at the floor], we could use a screwdriver"" [*Anastasia bites her lip. Christian continues to stare blankly into the ether. Screwdriver is seen for half a second]. That actually sounds way more entertaining compared to this movie.<br/><br/>In short, Dornan couldn't act his way out of a cardboard box (even one for that king-sized bed from Ikea), and the film pays a huge price by casting him as the lead role. That being said: bless Dakota Johnson's heart. She really gave it her all in this movie and tried to make a steak dinner out of a baloney sandwich. She's relatable, plain and pleasant and does a fine job at her job (though anyone would appear great next to that block of wood named Dornan). The lack of chemistry is palpable, or bitterly dry (I don't know which is more accurate). You can't blame the girl. I couldn't imagine lying on a bed naked while cast and crew stare over you expecting you to moan and pretend to be turned on by a man with the personality of a washing machine pesters you over and over about a contract (Seriously give it a rest dude. You sound super rapey about the contract. And quit waking her up all the time. Let the poor girl sleep). Dakota's a decent actress, and I hope she pulls the rip cord and distances herself from this franchise before she gets typecast as ""full frontal"" girl.<br/><br/>If I took anything away from this film, it's that sadly human beings will do anything for a paycheck, and an audience will pay to see how boring it is. Mediocre has become the norm, and this film doesn't even make the grade. There's nothing good, or original, or edgy, or thought-provoking about 50 Shades. It feels dated, and designed to be fantasy porn for those too vanilla to try anything risqu√© in their own lives. Truthfully, if the main character wasn't a billionaire, or white, or attractive, this movie wouldn't be so popular. It would be a drama about horror, rape, and abuse and real issues people don't want to talk about. 50 Shades is a false portrayal of kink and a subculture that is already misunderstood. Really people just want to see two semi-attractive bodies rub up and down on each other and maybe daintily slap each other with whips (LOL, the kink in this movie is such a joke!).<br/><br/>For a movie gaining so much press because it covers the topic of sex, I wish I could have told it I had to work early in the morning and needed to go to bed. Nothing could ever make me watch this film again or convince me to see the sequel, even if they cast me over Dornan."

","For the past 20+ years I have watched one or two movies daily from various genres. I have watched some very low budget films that were pretty good, some blockbusters that were not as good as expected. Then I watched 50 shades. If this were a low budget, I'd say it was a good effort to make a mainstream film. The fact is that this movie costs 40 mil. to make, and I wonder, what on earth did they do with the money? They certainly didn't spent in on a skilled screenplay-writer, director or good actors.<br/><br/>That being said, if you watch the movie with a set of mind with very low expectations and not taking this film too seriously, it can still be entertaining. The first hour or so I really did en effort to look beyond the 4/10 rating IMDb has given so far, and not having read the book I was kind of interested in were the movie was going to. Unfortunately, after that hour I completely lost interest and I couldn't care less about the superficial characters that looked so hallow and uncomfortable and made me want to slap them in the face with a chair.<br/><br/>Near the end I had the feeling I was watching ""50 shades of parody"". It wasn't romantic, it wasn't dramatic, it was empty in every dimension.

Many of the reviews here are similar in grammar and tone, I was starting to think it was some kind of conspiracy. I actually believed there was some kind of anti-fifty shades of grey movement happening on the internet. Shockingly, I was completely wrong.<br/><br/>How to sum this movie up... pretty much everything that has been said here is true. The acting and plot outside of sex scenes absolutely plays out like the stuff you would see in softcore porn. Clich√© after clich√© right down to the core, I really can't stress enough how awkward and downright tacky some of the lines, or even reactions in the movie play out. While reading reviews here, I saw the phrase ""sophomoric writing"" pop up many times, now I understand why. <br/><br/>The totally out of place and blatant lip biting, the ludicrous thirst showcased by Anastasia from the very first interaction with Grey is completely out of character and unbelievable for the type of person she is supposed to represent. Half of what she says reads and sounds like lines someone as awkward as her would come up with an hour later in the shower (alone). Christian's character has his owned forced one-liners that are obviously a service to book readers, I won't even bother with it because it has been covered extensively in other reviews. All I can say is I would be in for a few years worth of spankings after all the eye-rolling I did through this movie. <br/><br/>I am convinced the writer's views on romance and courtship have never surpassed the preconceptions developed during her teenage years, when everyone dreamed of being swept away by a mysterious figure with the potential to make all their material dreams come true. This movie is nothing more than a fan service, and I would expect no one but avid readers of the book to enjoy or even be able to take it seriously.

"CharlieGreenCG","7","28","64","11 February 2015"," So... what is the film actually like?
","It has sold over 100 million books in over 52 languages worldwide. It has become the UK's fastest ever selling book. It is the most talked about literature subject of many years. Heard of it? Yes! It is Fifty Shades of Grey!<br/><br/>Given this success, it was almost guaranteed to be adapted into a film at some point. So Hollywood obliged and churned out a film quickly for fans. Presented with a world-premiere at this years Berlinale film festival, we have just seen. So ... what is the film like?<br/><br/>For those unaware of the book's narrative, it follows the story of Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), a college graduate who takes her friend's place at an interview with a young, billionaire tycoon - Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). But, what Anastasia soon finds, is that Grey is not all he seems, as she is invited to join him in sexual encounters.<br/><br/>Brought back to the basics, it is essentially a story of a prince meeting a princess - just that the prince has several strange passions. 'I don't do romance, my tastes are singular' he says ... which is an merely an innuendo for over-the-top sexual endeavours, which include - but not limited to; bondage, whipping, ropes, dominance and submission.<br/><br/>Obviously this is the talking point of the adaptation given its nature. So, how has this been translated from the book to the screen? Mainly it is slow-motion effects, close-ups and aerial shots with heavy breathing. Not to say that this is restricted from the novel's original ideas, as there are many nude shots in its twenty- odd minute sexual scenes (in the total running time of two-hours).<br/><br/>The two leads of the film, Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey are also noteworthy of some mention. When first announced, names such as; Clooney, Gosling and Pattinson came to mind for the role of Grey, with Johansson and Lawrence up for the role of Ana'. Ultimately the roles went to Dakota and Jamie Dornan ...<br/><br/>Visually they both look the part. Dornan as Grey; the Bruce Wayne- like billionaire, who lives within the finest luxuries (yet a dark twist). And Anastasia, as the awkward college grad who seems out of her league. It starts shallow with some awkwardness, conferences and business formalities. But soon transforms into bulk sex scenes with some small intercepts between.<br/><br/>Helicopter rides, skyline view hotels, and kinky sex-rooms (playrooms) are all the range, as the film pushes erotic boundaries like no other. Where most dramatic romances have about one bedroom sex scene, this, by comparison has at least eight. Likewise in the comparison, Fifty Shades' is more explicit than them too.<br/><br/>Visually, director Sam Taylor-Johnson has shot it with style. In terms of sound it also compensates from Danny Elfman's backing, plus tunes from Beyonce, Ellie Golding and many others providing lyrical pleasure.<br/><br/>Raising questions such as why is the sex-weirdness so important, and what are the Fifty different Shades of Grey? Much is left on edge and - as fans of the novel will know, it ends of a cliff-hanger. Which, conveniently gets you to read the following two books (which have just been announced as upcoming films too).<br/><br/>The big question, should you see it? Yes, other than divulging fans of the book, it does actually contains some potential of intriguing story too - other than the erotica, come pornography headlines.<br/><br/>Read more at: http://www.gonewiththemovies.com/reviews/fifty-shades- of-grey-review.php"
"liz-chvatal","10","29","67","12 February 2015"," Honestly, I commend them...
","Why did I give this movie a 10, you ask? Well, I will happily tell you. The movie, even though it is based off of the book, is nothing like the book. I am not hearing the words ""inner goddess"" 60 times nor am I reading ""gasp"" more times than I blink. Every character that was in the movie was perfect, hand picked, and well done. Ana is a lovable young girl and Christian isn't as Alpha Male as the book describes. It's actually quite fun to watch these two interact on screen during their conversations. Ana, which in the book, is a more naive character, is portrayed as intelligent, witty, and sassy, which is a nice change. Christian, although seemingly dominant, shows the softer side of him throughout most of the movie.<br/><br/>Now, to those of you who haven't seen the movie but are rating it based upon the books just sound ignorant. At no point in time does E.L. James state this IS what BDSM is, this is HER fantasy, something that she has been thinking up for awhile now, this is what SHE wants. Everyone's fantasies differ, that's what makes things like this so taboo. Assuming that this is what the BDSM style is like is simply ignorant. I don't think they have a reason to be offended because she's ""Not portraying the right BDSM lifestyle"" Is there really a ""right way""? Some people cover them selves in leather, others are chained, others use ropes, women and men can both be submissive and dominant. At NO point does she out right say that this IS what BDSM is, and that's it. No, she doesn't.<br/><br/>Another issue that is being brought up is rape. When in the hell does he rape her!??! At no time in my reading of the books does he ever rape her!? Did you even read the book!? What!? Also, she agrees to this lifestyle and she is the one who willingly submits (she even ASKS him some of the time). When she says ""NO"" or ""STAY AWAY FROM ME"", he does. I'm really not seeing any rape here. You can't rape the willing (which is also known as 'consensual sex') Weird concept, huh? Also, boycotting it for domestic violence?! Please, this movie was ANYTHING but that. At no time did he out right beat her or even get close to doing that. Unless you think it's abusive to aggressively make out with someone in an elevator unexpectedly. Eh. I was honestly trying to find even a HINT of domestic violence...I came up with nothing.<br/><br/>You're probably sick of reading this by now, but, a few more things to add to the table. Boycotting this movie because it's ""Violent"" ""Against Sacredness of Sex"" ""Rape"" ...have you even seen the movies that are out right now!? I would rather watch a woman asking to be whipped than a child in American Sniper get his brains drilled out by terrorists. Or a girl who is portrayed at 16/17 years old in The Boy Next Door completely naked and sucking off 'the boy next door' (underage porn much? even if she is really 25, her character is NOT). Oh, and that SAW Series!? What the hell you guys, really? You're OK with someone sawing off their leg and playing games with people, but not with Ana and Christian!? Last thing: How sex should be sacred. PLEASE NOW, that is a joke in today's society and if you think this movie takes away from that, please pardon yourself from EVER watching Game of Thrones, Dexter, Sons of Anarchy, ya know, those super popular shows about killing and sex and crime? Why aren't you boycotting those?! How do those have such high ratings?"

"Jackierym1","8","15","31","14 February 2015"," Yes, yes...maybe more.
","Jamie did an amazing Christian Grey as did Dakota with Ana. The movie stayed pretty close to the books, in a sense. The sex scenes are not as scandalous as some people have said, and they're actually pretty brief. Unless you're ultra conservative, those scenes won't freak you out. I've seen more explicit scenes on some very famous cable shows, like Masters of Sex. I really enjoyed the movie but I felt it was rushed. Because so many details were omitted, at times it felt like it jumped from scene to scene without anything tying them together. I understood where they were going with each scene but only because I've read the books. I think they missed the mark by eliminating details and conversations between Christian and Ana that appear in the book that humanize Christian and make him more lovable. He's quite playful in the books and you can feel his love for Ana growing as the story goes on. That's not as clear in the movie. It ended as it should, as it ends in the book (mostly). But even the ending lacked depth, which it has in the books. What leads to the last scene in the Red Room, what follows, Ana's words for Christian and his to her are cut short in the movie, which made it seem a bit cold. There's a lot more emotion in the book. Those of us that know the books well (100 million or so) would have gladly sat through 20 more minutes of the movie to have those added details in there. If you've never read the books or just hated the movie because it had too much sex, you didn't like the story or whatever, there's no changing your mind. Good thing this movie wasn't made for you, and it's going to make loads of money despite your negative criticism, which means Fifty Shades Darker and Freed are coming. Ha!"
"ohyeahdarnell","7","15","31","14 February 2015"," Fifty Shades of give it a chance.
","If you read the book and truly know how the story is, the movie is great. The chemistry is good. The writing is cheesy but its still worth watching. I think Dakota is the perfect Ana. Though i wasn't looking forward to having Jamie as Christian, i warmed up to it. This story is beyond the sex, people need to realize this. There were laughs which were acceptable but at times people laughed at things that didn't need laughter. But i digress. I saw give it a chance and know that it isn't a porno, its part one of a twisted love story. I love the cinematography and i think this franchise will grow on to people rather than people ""knocking it before they try it""."
"elle_for_all","3","15","31","13 February 2015"," The story can be explained a little bit more
","First, I would say that this movie did have some great scenes to illustrate the relationship and the character of Ana and Christian. However, as a viewer like me, who haven't read the book, I can hardly understand why Ana is ""devastated"" towards Christian. They did have some romance, some enjoyable sex between them, but then escalated to fast how Ana get annoyed on the terms of the contract and then the frustration towards the extreme BDSM. <br/><br/>I can understand how Christian Grey as a controller, but I can't have the same feeling inside Ana. It seems that Ana enjoyed having fun with Christian, wants to know more about him, which Christian didn't satisfied every of them, and suddenly Ana wanted to leave him."
"Athul_A_S","4","7","12","26 March 2015"," Disappointment In The End Of a Tremendous Build Up
","Being a box office hit means nothing. The book series is the main reason for this film's success as the movie itself offers nothing but so many nudity. The romance flick between Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey is not at all well portrayed and if you have read the book you will be scratching your hair. The movie seems a rushed one as it mainly focuses on sex scenes rather than a romantic movie. The portraying of Christian Grey was good but same cannot be said for Anastasia Steele, even though Dakota Johnson offers the sexy side of Anastasia Steele. When we watch a movie, it has to look natural,feel natural , but in Fifty Shades of Grey many scenes appear very artificial which normal audiences won't go with. Expecting a greater sequel to this series, I end my words."
"adamheywoodks","Null","7","12","17 March 2015"," Terrible
","Really terrible. Don't waste your money. I'm required to give a more in-depth review, though I feel as if I've already said everything that I can. So here goes...<br/><br/>First: the acting. It's insulting. Dornan's attempt at seductive comes across as just creepy. Reminded me of Hannibal Lecter's introduction in The Silence of the Lambs. Johnson's turn fares slightly better. She's at least believable. The supporting cast turn in polished, but ultimately negligible, performances. Their forgettable characters just flit in and out of scenes, punctuating the viewer's boredom with merely a variety of things with which to be bored.<br/><br/>That being said, the writing is probably to blame for the performances. The cast can hardly help what's on the page. It feels as though the studio randomly selected somebody off the street, gave them a basic outline, and a weekend in a Slovakian slum to finish the task.<br/><br/>Yet even this is not the worst part. The writer is just adapting a story. No, the root cause is that the story just isn't very good.<br/><br/>I think that covers it. I could continue, but to do so would validate the film more than it deserves. Like I said, don't waste your money. This review is more entertaining.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money."
"xosabrinashen47","10","22","49","13 February 2015"," Fifty Shades of Grey was actually a beautiful movie.
","Just finished watching Fifty Shades of Grey and I gotta say... the film was beautiful. Yes, I am using the word beautiful to describe this movie. I went into the theater completely prepared to be embarrassed because of how graphic it was supposed to be, but I was extremely surprised by how I actually felt. I watched all of the scenes that were made available and thought that it all seemed a bit awkward, but it was only because there was no background music or noise. Watching the actual scenes in the movie was a whole other experience. <br/><br/>The movie is getting a really bad rep because of the bad writing and graphic scenes that are in the book that it is based on. However, the movie is not just a ""sex movie"" like everyone says. It's pretty hilarious and romantic. The sex scenes were extremely dialed down and they all served a purpose. If you thought the pointless sex in The Wolf of Wall Street was acceptable, then you would be more than okay with the content in this Fifty Shades. Before I watched Fifty Shades of Grey, I watched a lot of interviews with the cast of the film and was confused as to how they could possibly describe the sex scenes as being classy and elegant. But then again, all I had to compare it to were scenes from Game of Thrones, True Blood, The Wolf of Wall Street, etc... After watching this film, I can honestly say that I completely agree with the cast. There was nothing ""dirty"" or ""wrong"" about what I was seeing on the screen. Sam Taylor-Johnson, the director, did an excellent job with this movie. She made it very tasteful and easier to accept. This film could have gone in a very bad direction, but thank god it didn't. <br/><br/>For those of you that think that this movie is glorifying abusive relationships, think again because I think that it actually empowers women. I'm sure that you can argue, with quotes from the book, that I'm wrong, but there are many differences between the film and the book. Let me remind all of you that the book is a little over 500 pages and the movie is only about 2 hours long. Obviously, they had to cut a lot of things out, including the blue string scene that I'm sure a lot of people are aware of. In my opinion, they cut out many of the scenes that were considered controversial. I watched the movie looking for signs of an abusive relationship, but I really didn't see anything of that nature. In fact, all I saw was this confident and empowered woman that made all of her own decisions. She was not forced to do anything that she didn't want to do. She wanted to explore Christian's dark world and her own sexuality. You can argue that Christian abuses her physically and emotionally, but he does what she tells him to do. When she says stop¬Ö he stops. He tries to make it work with her.<br/><br/>Moving on to something lighter, the comedy in this movie is on point! There were many ""laugh- out-loud"" moments that gave the movie a lighter mood. Those scenes were there to show that Christian and Ana's relationship was not all dark and serious. I mean they are both young people in their twenties that should be having fun! <br/><br/>Dakota Johnson gave a phenomenal performance and did everything right! She was confident, awkward, shy, and funny all at the same time. Jamie Dornan also did an amazing job as Christian Grey. They had great chemistry. <br/><br/>I guess what I'm trying to say is that you should give the movie a chance. If you hate the book, it doesn't necessarily mean that you will hate the movie. I have read many reviews, written by skeptics, saying that they ended up loving it. Don't let the bad reviews or even the book itself stop you from seeing the movie. I was not disappointed at all with the finished product, even though they cut out a few scenes that I loved. It is perfect just the way it is. (I apologize for any grammatical mistakes... Unlike Ms. Steele, I am not an English major)"

"darrendweaver","1","10","19","21 February 2015"," 50 Shades of dullness
","Undoubtedly the most hyped film of the year so far with much anticipation from the millions who've already read the book, and those with 'singular' interests. There are so many poor qualities in the film, it has little or no redeeming features.<br/><br/>The cinematography looks fine, but the film lacks substance. Many other reviews will point out the flaws, but the main problem is I wasn't able to engage with the story or the characters. The exercise seems to have been just to fling parts of the book on the screen and see if it sticks. The film is always choppy, with many unanswered points left dangling - but the sex scenes are introduced to distract the audience from these discrepancies. If the sex scenes were actually good, it would probably have worked - unfortunately they aren't. Many films have dealt with this subject in a far more engaging manner (Last Tango in Paris, which engages through excellent performances).<br/><br/>Yet, the demographic it is aimed at will all flock to see this film, despite what any reviews say - they want to see Christian Grey brought to life. Personally, I could see someone like a young Pierce Brosnan doing a far better job, who would possess something that might be alluring to Miss Steele - charisma. Jamie Dornan lacks this quality, as does the film overall.<br/><br/>It is a boring film that will make so much money. On the plus side, it will help fund other, more interesting and engaging films."

You could also go to the pub and enjoy some chips, which should be nice. A pint will also be nice to go with the chips.

"ceocelebfae","3","10","19","16 February 2015"," Poor Direction, Terrible Screen writing and Bad Acting (except for Eloise Mumford)
","1) The pacing of the movie was far too quick. It was as if director Sam-Talyor Johnson and the screenwriters went into making the movie with the mentality of ""Well everyone read the book already, so everyone knows what the movie is about, so it isn't like we have to put any real focus on building such silly things like characterization, plot building, etc..etc.... The movie felt like a visual cliff notes version of the book, which worked to it's detriment. <br/><br/>Also, I feel that, this movie alienates those who didn't read the book. There was actually a man that I overheard coming out of the theater questioning what was going on in the movie because he hadn't even heard of the books. <br/><br/>BAD MOVE Directors and Screenwirters. Very bad movie!! <br/><br/>2) The only genuine actress in the entire movie is Eloise Mumford (who played Kate). She is the ONLY actor in the entire film that I felt was actually giving an truly believable performance, or even a PERFORMANCE for that matter. Everyone else (especially the two leads) felt like they were either phoning it in, and / or reciting lines directly from the book in a really bad staged reading rehearsal. This pure lack of character portrayal made the entire movie seem unrealistic and therefore, none of the relationships felt authentic.<br/><br/>To Eloise Mumford, you are singlehandedly the reason why I give this film 2 of it 3 stars, and I hope to hire you in a future production of mine. <br/><br/>3) The music was great, but POORLY used. <br/><br/>4) The movie was far too comedic, which I didn't expect at all. Why was the movie so funny? For one thing, I didn't believe anything that Mr. Grey and Anastasia Steele were saying because the performances were so bad it made even the most serious dialog seem light hearted and comical. Lastly, the movie goes by so quickly that I wasn't fully immersed in the world of the story anyway (except of course when Eloise hit the stage). <br/><br/>Overall, watch if your curious, but don't expect a cinematic masterpiece here."

","Well, I read the books several times and I still am. I saw the movie and I think it was perfect! But before I watch the film, I wanted to know what people who had seen the film could well think. There is a huuuuuuuuuge enemy team and the opposite. I read all opinions about fifty shades that are against it.<br/><br/>It is right to have an opinion, but look, it's yours. Just do not generalize about feminist subject or anything else. Oh and yes, stop judging. There is a lot of people who are practicing this kind of sex. I do not judge you because you do not like Facebook or because you eat McDonalds, etc. Whatever... <br/><br/>In the movie and the book, Anastasia was not forced by anyone to do it! She and only her decided to do it. This can be degrading for you, but maybe not for her ... and for all others who are practicing all that sex and stuff.<br/><br/>For those who hate, if you do not like it, just go away and go live your life! I mean, yes, OK you do not like this, and you think this is the worst movie ever! Good for you! But people who have not read the book and have not seen the film have their own opinion about it.

"nenaangelica","9","18","39","13 February 2015"," You must read the books to fully appreciate this movie
","First of all to all the people complaining that the book was terrible, I ask you this: Did you really think the movie would have been different than the book? If you didn't like the books there were high chances you weren't going to like the movie! what a surprise? Now if you are a fan of the books then this movie is one of the best book to screen adaptations I've seen! many of the lines were the same. Jamie performed way better in the Fall than in this movie but he wasn't bad, I wish he had shown us more Christian like Dakota did with Ana! I loved the way she did it! Perfectly summed up the way Ana would be.<br/><br/>The sex was good and enough for the movie, again Jamie's acting didn't fully express Christian's character so it looked a bit forced but all the scenes in the movie were in the book and I thought they did a good job of portraying the rawness of it without it looking like straight up porn. Kudos to Sam Taylor-Johnson for that.<br/><br/>The ending was exactly like it ended in the book... in the book it goes a bit further since Ana is narrating but that was unnecessary for the movie. The thing that people need to realize is that these books cannot be read on their own, they are not their separate stories, it is part 1, 2, and 3 of the same story, and of course there are many things that you will not see in this movie. I am very anxiously waiting for Fifty Shades Darker and hoping that the chemistry between Jamie and Dakota improves and that Jamie gets more into Christian's head. By book 2 their love story develops a lot more.<br/><br/>The music was beautiful! Beyonce and Ellie Goulding were my favorites! Finally to the people complaining that it's not realistic, of course it's not! it's fiction! a fantasy! it's not supposed to send any kind of message! E.L. James wrote these books for fun! So you need to take this story for what it is.<br/><br/>Overall as a fan I loved it! it was definitely fun to watch! Only reason this review gets a 9 it's because I feel Jamie could've done a lot better!"
"ceniceros86","10","33","79","11 February 2015"," Great Film
","So I got the privilege of going to the fan screening last week, and I was nervous, because I feared that with the TV Spots that meant the movie might not be great but you know what it was! I was excited because Dakota & Jamie have modeling background, so they are comfortable with working their bodies in front of the camera. The music with the scenes were pieced in together beautifully. I like that Dakota brought forth her natural sass, charisma and humour and Jamie has this ability to be cold one moment, and look adorably cute the next. The fact that Sam is a photographer was also something I was excited about because the shots of the city,and the shots of the different angles of certain scenes with Jamie & Dakota in the red room, his bedroom or her room, as well as the view of the city was so wonderfully pieced together so I look forward to seeing the next two adaptations if all three are a part of it. People might dislike this film because its not exactly like the book, but people have to remember its an ADAPTATION, or perhaps because they think they had a different vision of what the characters looked like, but this is Sam Taylor Johnson's vision of the characters, and she saw qualities or ways that these actors portrayed these characters that she knew were perfect for HER vision, or maybe it's because of what you feel about what their love story entails, but you know, just because you don't like it, don't push your thoughts and hate on other people, respect what others like and dislike. Watch it if you're a fan of Dakota, Jamie or Sam, or if you're a fan of the books, or if you're curious to see what it's about, but just have an open mind ;)"
"priscillacollard","9","12","24","14 February 2015"," Don't Be Fooled This Movie Was GOOD!!!
","I usually don't leave reviews for movies i've seen, but i feel this movie is getting such a bad name that i had to put my two cents in. This movie had so many things going against it before it was even released and a lot of viewers let that cloud their minds. With that said this movie was no SOFT CORE PORN! I'm tired of hearing it referenced as such, as of today i've seen this movie twice and enjoyed it both times. True this movie can be a little confusing if you didn't read the book and that's why i'm giving it a 9/10 rating. BUT on the acting Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson are right on key. Critics stated that Dornan didn't bring the depth to his character but i have to disagree with their assessment. I felt that Dornan brought a kind of awkward not comfortable in his skin kind of feel to Grey which is how Grey is in the books, he isn't comfortable with himself but puts on a the front of a cold and calculated individual and Dornan brings that to the screen in flying colors. Johnson brought Ana to the screen is such a way that we all felt for her when she struggled to except Grey's world and we were able to connect with her on an emotional level. I'm not going to go into depth and tell you part of the movie or the book because those would be spoilers so with that i'm urging viewers that have not read the book to go into this movie with open eyes, don't focus on the bad publicity this film has been getting for it's sexual content and it's BDSM content, focus on the love store woven into this movie, and i hope the people that do watch this movie feel the need to read this series, there is a lot more to this series then meets eye. I hope there are more open minded people out there then close minded."

","First what I should mention is TRIGGER WARNING this movie is not suitable for people who are/have been in an emotionally abusive relationship. This movie managed to get so much attention, so please, do not write me ''it is just a movie, chill'', young girls are going to watch this movie and what will they see? They will see themselves in the role of Ana, young, poor and inexperienced woman with low self esteem and no self worth. The movie/book will make them believe that what they need to find is somebody to ''take care of them''. And then the problems start. The care taker, Christian, is portrayed as this ''damaged'' person who is into bondage stuff and needs saving. What's really going on there is so much different and so horrifying, honestly. If you know anything about BDSM, you know that its about intimacy and bringing pleasure to both partners, who both agree to this. What is portrayed in the movie/books IS NOT BDSM. Ana did express her dislike for being spanked, but Christian didn't really care. Even though she did have a safety word for when in red room of pain, after she'd use it, Christian would mock and ridicule her for using it, making her feel sorry for doing so. The only way of making sure Christian stays around is doing what his sick perverted mind desires, and since Ana has no self worth, she will do all of that. This is not okay. He controls her every move and is turned on when she refuses him (mm... kinda sounds like a damn rapist) He holds her away from family and friends, manipulates her actions so they would fit him, controls what she eats, even. Girls will think it's fun when a boy does this to them, girls will think this is how he expresses love. Girls will stay in an abusive relationships, because the man just needs ''saving''. These things don't allow me to enjoy what is happening in the books/movies and honestly I have no idea why would the author would even go to write something as disgusting as this and why someone would go and make a movie out of that. So please, if you can, do not go and see this movie, do not give money to people who made this and are glamorizing abuse and rape. Go watch anything else or give money to people who support victims of abusive relationships. If you still go watch this, at least educate yourself about what's wrong with this movie and tell your friends about this too."

Thats the way the directors are filming it. they want to make it classy, not trashy, thats what porn is for and many of you that think its the same thing well the movie is not based on that. As far as being badly written, its not. Im not high scholar or a English major of some sort, i thought it was very well written and even the author herself said that she wrote the book for herself and never thought it would get this big. so for all of you that are heavily criticizing it, stop it, because it will not be JUST like the book.

This movie is just the same as twilight with the dialogue and plot a love triangle with more hard core sex and whip's and chains that will make Catwoman look like child's play. This concerns me about society it's almost like we have become so dumb. Now let me start off with this the movie does have so hard core porn nudity in it but it doesn't pay off with character's. The main actress is actually fine but its like she never goes anywhere as a person and becomes just like every stupid woman who needs a man in her life to save her from something. I would have been fine with the film if they didn't do that. How many times must you go to a film and you have a woman acting stupid and always needing a man. It was so clich√© and Mr. Grey is very stiff and wooden (pun intended) as a character. This movie is so bad that its funny and kind of sad that as a society we have just gotten dumb. Now the BDSM part was actually fun to me because its fresh for the audiences today who act like they don't do that kind of stuff at home. It was just the fact that the movie gave Ms. Steel no arch she didn't become strong. I would have believed it more if she became more like him and being more into S&M and liked it and felt free and didn't depend on a rich man to save the day. Its just stupid and it makes you think how most people get around in the world and how to make money. Just do what ever a rich man says. Or like the writer of this book did. Copy from another shi*y book and make more money then you could ever imagine. It's no creativity in this society. I'm done, if you want to go see this movie fine but you might as well just watch so hard core porn because the sex scenes don't even pay off"

","Jamie played his part to the T. His intense looks, the enjoyment, and the internal fight he was having; showed up very well on the big screen. Dakota was great. I didn't like Ana in the book but walked out of the movie loving her. The humor is well written and acted. Wish they could have made it a longer movie, 3 Hours would have been better. There are a few things missing from the book to the movie that helped make it more clear that he is trying to keep her safe and to care for her. There are also some thing that help link book one to two. I'm wondering how they will work it. I believe many people that are too vanilla can't over sex acts to see the movie for what it is. It is a love story. As for the music, bought the CD and have not taking it out of the car in 5 weeks. I drive about an hour every day and don't skip any of the tunes."

","First of all i don't understand why so much hate on this movie?And why did IMDb website open voting process when the movie wasn't even shown at the theaters?Haters are going to hate but leave it alone already!<br/><br/>Now down to the movie...After the very long anticipation and excitement for the movie i experienced two feelings after seeing it. - Astonished -Frightened<br/><br/>Film is totally fine and doesn't contain abuse or anything that hurts female population at all! Everything is consensual and negotiated. By the end of the film you will realize,ironically that Anastasia is in charge.<br/><br/>Film is fun to watch with partners and reason for that is Dakota Johnson.Yes, her sense of humor that was given to a character needs to be praised all the way.She makes the film a romantic comedy that will soon give new dark twist that makes this movie intriguing in the first place.She is not annoying and i like her character more in movie than from the book.Both of them, even Jamie Dornan has developed sense of humor that makes this movie entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>Now i have some worries about Johnson...i feel like she has given too much of exposure to herself for this film without being aware of the consequences. I would be so woesome if she fails in getting what she wants and that her career of acting will flop afterwards. Because she is such a great actress.<br/><br/>Cinematography and Soundtrack for this movie are perfect! And i have no complaints about that. Plot is okay but the dialog wasn't so great. It was cheesy. But Hey!All the Nicholas Sparks movies have cheesy dialogs but better rating for some reason, and who gives a darn about that.<br/><br/>Sex scenes were not shocking or controversial but very well done in artistic way.Praise Sam Taylor Johnson for that.In particular one i like the most is Anastasia losing virginity. That scene was simply beautiful shot.Angles,background music and the most gorgeous part was when the camera was directed to the ceiling where we can see reflection of Ana and Christian having sex and that part reminded me so much of an artist √âdouard-Henri Avril.<br/><br/>The movie is simply beautiful and i hope that people will stop complaining about it. I gave it a 10 just because this movie deserves more and has so much more in its source material. Hope this helps. Looking forward for the sequels."

","I have never seen such a lifeless, underwritten script make it to the screen, let alone with such a budget. A slow build up, I was expecting, but where was the suspense? This is a story about sex and yet there was no obvious reason why they would have sex. It was all mechanistic tease, no enjoyment, no orgasms. When Christian finally gets Anastasia in his Playroom he doesn't seem to enjoy himself anymore than when they did it 'vanilla' style. There could have been so much more detail here, so much more characterisation - we can assume that Gray can only orgasm in a bondage situation, but where was the evidence? Think of 'Some Like it Hot', with Tony Curtis feigning lack of interest while Marilyn Monroe lies on top of him - and that was a far sexier film. I like this director's work - her film about John Lennon was funny and poignant - but this script was almost unfilmable. The depressing thought is, and this evidence proves it, that box office failure was inconceivable, however bad the end result. Dakota Johnson does her best and brings some humour and vulnerability to the role, and manages to make the abrupt changes of mind (mostly) believable, despite minimal support from the dialogue. But Jamie Dornan is just pleasant, a nice looking boy like you might find waiting at your table in a Dublin restaurant. Totally miscast, too young, merely eye candy. (Reminded me of George Lazenby in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. But that was a movie with a *story*.) Meanwhile, if you want the eye candy then there's plenty of pics of Mr Dornan available on the web in various stages of undress. There's plenty of pics, and indeed films, where you can see people having sex and giving a damn sight better impression of enjoying it. Save your money. Please."

","I did not read the book and I submitted to my wife's desire to see the movie. I lobbied for an alternate choice since I biased myself reading reviews. I still went with an open mind, and we usually take turns picking movies anyways.<br/><br/>The audience was 98% female, perhaps 50 people total. Yup, I was the only guy there I could see. The previews included warnings to shut off your cellphone and not to put your feet on the chair in front of you... This did not stop 3 from doing that.<br/><br/>My legs were starting to ache sitting thru it all. I am not sure if that was the chairs fault or a result of boredom.<br/><br/>There is no action, and the sex is reminiscent of those zalman king shows on TV... A little T&A but not much else. That's OK. Ana is a confessed virgin waiting for the right guy so you tend to think she is fairly simple and straight-laced... what she saw in Christian who does not do romance, and in such a short period of time is a mystery and artificial. I slightly chuckled a few times from the dialogue. The story in general isn't so bad I suppose... and the ending is probably the most believable emotional scene. I've seen worse movies and scores of better movies. I can't in good conscience give it a 1. My wife said she'd give it a 6, but that number has been falling since last weekend. We likely won't see a sequel... Unless there is nothing better in the theatres at that time."

With the help of real love, and not lust we all confuse at our early age with. BDSM also has its right, with consent. Just like prohibition has its right to repeal. So why? 3/10 that's low..

","I read the books, so I wanted to see how they could turn it into a movie. I give it to the actors especially Dakota Johnson. She was perfect for the role and she played her character really well. Those are some intimate scenes and thanks to her performance, weren't weird to watch.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise to me is its funny! The book is serious with lots of sex details so to see them lighten things up with comedy was great. I loved seeing it in a theater full of women. <br/><br/>Did I think this book was a romance for the ages and a soon to be classic novel no! So I didn't expect this to be a ""Notebook"" type movie. I wished it could have been a little longer so you get more character detail. The music was used great in the film. <br/><br/>I will see it again because I think it's a fun girls night out film. It's funny and nice to see how they give a shy innocent girl more power than she realizes she has.

"maria-555-810221","2","13","27","14 February 2015"," 0 Shades of Gray...
","(I have to mention that my review contains spoilers and that I have read the complete trilogy before seeing the movie.) What's wrong with the screenplay? If I wanted to watch the summary of the book I would have stuck to the trailers and the exclusive clips...<br/><br/>I believe that the consistency of the movie's plot was completely nonexistent. It was like several scenes of the book were stitched together, in a way that someone who hasn't read the book, before seeing the movie would be totally lost. I've seen lots of movies based on books and at least most of them had the required consistency to be able to respond to the concept of a ""movie based on a book"" and that implies the adaptation and the absolute visualization of the book. <br/><br/>They failed to convey the fundamental and broader idea of E. L. James book alongside to the proper presentation of the characters and images contained therein.Consumed in their effort to bring to life the two protagonists, thus lost the dominant romance and prevail awkward, bizarre and completely without chemistry, sexual scenes.<br/><br/>The absence of fine details that define the characters of Anna and Christian led to the misconception of the form of their uncommon relationship. Ana was presented as a giggly, inexperienced, superficial, young student who was dazzled not only by Grey's stunning outward appearance but also by his insane wealth. While in the book we were constantly aware of her thoughts and believes, since the narration of the events was from her point of view, in the movie it was taken for granted that that would never happen. Therefore, details such as her facial and body reactions were those which would form the nature of her character in the eyes of the viewers and prevent us from seeing her as a superficial middle-class girl who longs for the financial support of a wealthy man in exchange for sex, or actually, sex abuse. <br/><br/>Gray was presented as a cold man who likes to induce pain to women during sex. Even his infamous obsession with control was insufficient. And certainly he didn't seem at all to be a sexy dominant, able to seduce Ana with his intimidating charm and personality. Instead, he seemed to be sick sadist, that he actually cared only for her body and the satisfaction of his sexual needs and nothing more. <br/><br/>The main concept of their romance was how love can change everyone and guess what; we never had the chance to watch that in the movie. The actors seemed to have zero chemistry and their acting sometimes reminded me of a high school play.The rest of the cast, well I think there was no other cast than the two of them. I wonder why the other actors, that 'appeared' in the film, were even mentioned. That was a shame. <br/><br/>Finally, I have a crucial question; How are they going to proceed with the second movie without having mentioned in the first one that Jack Hyde hired Ana in SIP? I mean isn't Ana's first day in work how the second book starts? And moreover, what about Jos√©'s gallery show? Isn't that the reason that Christian asks Ana to meet him again since he's responsible that she doesn't have her car? The movie was a complete disaster. <br/><br/>I am a huge fan of the trilogy, and yet I wouldn't want them to proceed to the next two sequels. I think I'm gonna stick to the books..."

His opinion by the end of the movie was he was pleasantly surprised that he enjoyed the story, the characters and told me he would see the second film when it came out. The director Sam Taylor-Johnson did a phenomenal job, as well as the actors. Both nailed the characters and the chemistry was great! I was nervous about the sex scenes but they were nothing but tasteful! They were just enough to make you hold your breath, but not gasp. The editing was smooth and the story was very true to the books. Cinematically this movie came in right on point. It is not as others may of told you ""a porno"" as I said before it was very tasteful, for those who know/ have heard/ or read the book you know what it is about, so obviously, yes, sex will be in it.

Although while I will admit this film is not for everybody, anyone who enjoyed the book will probably enjoy the movie. People really shouldn't take this movie too seriously and go into it with an open mind. Obviously there is strong sexual content but that is basically a given since it is based on a book that's primary focus is sex.

","I have not read the books, and I won't. I have heard nothing positive about them, and I don't do much reading anyway. I always knew though a film adaptation of this book would end up being a box office juggernaut and I was right. One of the highest grossing films of 2015, Fifty Shades Of Grey was commercially successful but was a critical flop both with audiences and critics. I had to check it out, see what the fuss and critical panning was all about. Here goes¬Ö..<br/><br/>Very well shot, regularly amusing, superbly lit, a top notch soundtrack, well acted and with just enough flirtatious chemistry and banter, Fifty Shades Of Grey took me by surprise. I ignored all the negative buzz and reviews, blocked people out of my head and just sat back and watched it. My main criticism is aimed at the sex. Whilst there's enough of it, it never gets to hot and steamy levels. Those scenes barely register an 18 rating, I think that rating goes towards the inappropriate spanking and hard whipping scenes which must've been awkward to film. The film didn't need to be 120 minutes plus, most scenes are just snogging and a story this thin cannot sustain such an inflated length. What also annoyed me is the fact that one of my favourite singers, Rita Ora, who I have the hots for, was barely in this, she had one line and like 10 seconds of screen time, if that.<br/><br/>With that negatives out the way, I thought Dakota Johnson was excellent. This is her most ballsiest, raw and brave performances, taking on a role that could potentially be career poison turned out to be something unforgettable and vulnerable. I liked Jamie Dornan, playing it straight with deadpan delivery and seriousness, I didn't find any campy aspects and I thought he too was taking on a role many wouldn't dare. I think that there's more desire and cravings than there is chemistry between these two, and I appreciated that difference. Although the scene where Ana discusses the contract at a ""business meeting"" with Christian showed chemistry and some sly humour. Supporting performances were fine, but there's no meat there. Actresses like Jennifer Ehle and Marcia Gay Harden were pretty much wasted, considering their talents it's a criminal waste, as with Max Martini.<br/><br/>If there is going to be a sequel, it needs to be more explicit and sexy, to earn that 18 rating. The story needs more meat, stray away from the books and make for an interesting side plots and twists then maybe the film could earn some brownie points. One of the best things about this film is Ellie Goulding's ""Love Me Like You Do"". That says a lot when a song is one of the highlights."
"TxMike","Null","5","8","20 May 2015"," Not that sexy and not that interesting.
","I had decided long ago that I had no interest in seeing this movie. But recently I noticed that my public library had bought several BluRay copies and I could get one with no wait. So I figured, ""What the heck"" and now I know what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>I have no idea how well it translated from the book(s) but I imagine that the target audience is mostly romantic women. It is about a simple woman quite accidentally meeting a very handsome, wealthy and self-assured young man who takes an interest in her. What woman wouldn't like that fantasy?<br/><br/>The main problem I have with the movie is it asks lots of questions but provides no answers. The handsome and wealthy man loves kinky sex but keeps any woman he likes at arm's length. On a couple of occasions it seems like they will address that but don't. And then it ends with what can only be interpreted as setting it up for the first sequel. <br/><br/>The young woman, just finishing college, goes to an interview assignment in the place of her roommate who is feeling bad. Dakota Johnson, daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, plays that role as Anastasia Steele. By all indications she is a regular hard- working girl with normal morals. She is taken aback by the attention but learns to enjoy it. But she is not sure she wants to sign the contract he requires.<br/><br/>The wealthy young man, raised as an orphan, is driven to be the best in what he does, and loves to dominate. Jamie Dornan plays this role as Christian Grey. He flies his own helicopter, he is generous with gifts, he runs a foundation, but he is trapped within the demons we never find out about.<br/><br/>Then, as the movie ends right after he tells Ana goodbye, he gets up abruptly from a board meeting, we figure he wants to pursue her but it fades to the credits. <br/><br/>Somewhat entertaining but overall a movie that cheats to get your attention. I don't plan to see the sequels."
"A-L-Ourson","9","5","8","14 March 2015"," ""Fifty Shades of Grey"": Beautiful People Having Believable Sex
","""Fifty Shades of Grey"" has been getting a lot of bad reviews, but in truth, it exceeded my expectations. I did read all of the books, just barely, as the third one was a little hard for me to get through. Against books alone, the movie is amazing. The film manages to do something that the books did not: make the characters likable.<br/><br/>Throughout reading the novels, I often wanted to punch Ana in the face. Her ""Inner Goddess"" and constant blushing, to the point that I thought she might have suffered from some kind of medical problem, grated on my nerves. Not to mention, she didn't own a computer or have email. Seriously, you cannot go to college without email. Not believable in this century. The movie removes that problem by saying that Ana's computer is down. Instead of being a girl from the wrong century, she becomes a broke college student who can't afford new electronics.<br/><br/>Throughout watching the movie, I wanted to hug Ana constantly. Dakota Johnson is officially my new celebrity crush. It was hard for me to understand the novel's portrayal of everyone adoring Ana, as she seemed to be awkward in an unlikeable fashion. In the movie, Dakota Johnson gave me comprehension of how someone could be super awkward but also super f**king adorable. Not only is she drop dead gorgeous with an absolutely amazing body, she smiled and giggled so charmingly, I understood why everyone loved her. I respected her power play during the business meeting, where she just left Christian there (payback for him ditching her after graduation). And her angry and final No! at the end of the movie was far more powerful than Ana's reluctant exit of the book. My favorite scene of Miss Johnson's had to be when she was drunk, I could not stop laughing at how endearing she was.<br/><br/>Jamie Dornan. Hot. Great abs and really nice butt. He is the perfect choice for Christian. I know that fans got really mad when Charlie Hunnam pulled out, but as much as I like Charlie, I think Jamie's boyish personality and looks make him more suitable for the part. Charlie is sexy, that is for sure, but Jamie is kind of sexy/nerdy, making him a more believable 27 year old billionaire. I also liked that Jamie played Christian akin to a commitment-phobe rather than a totally stunted man. Yeah, he is controlling, but Jamie played it up like Christian is f'd up, but also just like your average 20 something year old guy who doesn't want to stay the night at his girlfriend's place. His portrayal was more believable and easier for me to connect to him as a character. I thoroughly enjoyed how he played the sex scenes. I actually saw him clearly as a dominant; he didn't overact the control aspect, he just seemed like the type of guy who would do whatever he wanted in bed and would drive his partner crazy in the process.<br/><br/>There are definitely some faults in the film. Some of the writing is corny, but you kind of have to expect that in a romantic film. In terms of plot, if you already read the book, you know that it is a very basic relationship story, nothing too climactic happens; I didn't mind that because I knew it before going in, but my boyfriend was extremely bored with the film and its two-hour length. I know people complained that the sex scenes were too tame, but I don't actually think that is the case. It was definitely like soft-core erotica, but we still got to see a lot of nudity, and it was tasteful. If I just wanted to see two people going at it uncoordinated and fully nude, I could just watch porn at home.<br/><br/>All and all, the movie was entertaining and even better the second time I watched it because I knew when the corny lines were coming, so it wasn't as comically bad. I can't wait to catch the sequels and see how Johnson's giggly charisma and Dornan's boyish charm add to the rest of Ana and Christian's story."

Along with this the actors did a magnificent job to make comedy brilliantly intertwined in the movie. Their decision to act so dreadful was a great way to bring comedy into the already fantastic movie. Plus the corny dialog was great to really remind you of the book's writing, which is rare, as adaptations are rarely so similar. However the best part of the movie is the valuable message it gives. All you must do to get mysterious men to open up to you is perform lots of weird sex activities, which is what we really must realize.

","I loved the movie. I really felt the chemistry between Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan. They were just what I imagined Anastasia and Christian would be in the books. I don't see a reason why there are harsh comments saying Jamie is not ""fit"" to be Christian Grey, and that it should be played by actors like you know who. I respect other's taste of choice, but I really think Jamie did great. He had that Christian Grey authoritarian impression but he also showed a bit of Christian's vulnerability in his eyes. And Dakota was perfect for Anastasia Steele with her charmingly innocent features, and sass with a touch of sexiness. They make you love their characters no matter how grave the situation they are in.<br/><br/>There were some good parts and lines in the book that was not acted out in the movie, but that was okay because they were just minor stuff anyway. I was glad because the sex scenes were sure intense but was done in a refined way than what ""others"" expected from the film. I like the ending, it leaves you hanging for more. Just like in the book. There were moments were I laughed, was near to crying, and got captivated and infatuated. Which was perfect. And i felt Ana and Christian's pain(which was profoundly exhibited), and where it was coming from, which is important for the audience to feel. These moments tell you that THERE IS MORE to Fifty Shades of Grey, than simply showcasing eroticism and BDSM, or the rubbish stuff harsh commentators say about it. (Maybe they didn't even watch the movie or read the books, or if they did, then I think they didn't try to delve in enough to the story for better comprehension and approach.) I'll definitely buy a copy of the movie. :)"

","I read all three books. Yes I agree I would rather have seen other actors in this movie. But to my surprise they made it work. Most bad reviews are coming from guys that have no clue and people that focused on sex only in this movie. Only a beautiful, rich, confident man and mutual chemistry can get away with being Mr. Grey. So guys don't try this at home. Focus on the journey not the sex and you will understand why women are drawn to the books and this movie. Inconclusion: Not rape. Both parties consent to the sexual act and explored limits within means. I hate pain not my thing. But I did enjoy everything. I will continue being a fan. Looking forward to 2017 Movie"
"thesar-2","2","8","15","23 March 2015"," Half-Off Discount! The Twenty-Five Things Fifty Shades of Grey Made Me Ponder
","1. I'd really rather watch a movie about Anastasia Beaverhausen. <br/><br/>2. The only difference between this movie and the vampire movie, Twilight, is the lack of fangs. Oh, wait. Neither had any fangs. <br/><br/>3. ""Fvck the contract. You think it's a little redundant, don't you?"" asks Christian. Yes. Yes. Yes. And YES.<br/><br/>4. Oh, and the two-hour suspense of Miss Wishy Washy's ""will she/won't she"" sign the contract is as riveting as watching a bill get debated on C-SPAN.<br/><br/>5. I've seen more nudity, sex and fake bondage on YouTube. With the safety function on.<br/><br/>6. Considering Anastasia has the mind ‚Äì and almost body ‚Äì of a 5-year-old, the police should really look into Christian's porn stash. <br/><br/>7. ""Listen to me: I don't do romance,"" says Christian perfectly as this is about as romantic as a hot tub filled with bleach. <br/><br/>8. Confusing an adult playroom with one that contains an ""Xbox and stuff"" makes me wonder if the target audience saw this as a double feature with The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge out of Water.<br/><br/>9. People might have wondered where Arnold Schwarzenegger was had this kept its original title of Predator. <br/><br/>10. We saw Walter White teach more chemistry in all five seasons of Breaking Bad than the director did to these two ""actors"" in this one movie.<br/><br/>11. A third grader could conduct a more stimulating interview, even without the use of the internet that seemed to be absent in the college student's research. <br/><br/>12. Laughably, homophobic actor, Jamie Dorman, gets asked by his costar, Dakota Johnson: ""What are butt plugs?""<br/><br/>13. There's more ""grey"" in this than The Grey. <br/><br/>14. Anastasia's constant excuse for lack of emailing is that her computer is down¬Öin one of the most technically advanced cities in the world. <br/><br/>15. ""Seattle? That's where we're going?"" is the perfect question to ask someone who you know lives there and is headed home¬Öand you have the brain of algae.<br/><br/>16. Too bad Kristen Stewart's clone experiment was a failure. But, on the bright side, if Dakota Johnson continues to ""act,"" Kristen might very well be knocked off the top of the worst actress list. <br/><br/>17. It's an insult when you realize this doofus ditz is based on Bella from the Twilight series. And that's saying a lot when you know how awful Bella is.<br/><br/>18. Actually, Bella still has the prize as worse on screen chick. Bella's smart enough to use and destroy her many men. Anastasia holds but a tenth of those smarts.<br/><br/>19. Really, the safety word should be ""R-Rating"" as this was so incredibly safe, it should've been PG-13.<br/><br/>20. Anastasia strings Christian for so much of the movie, I almost wanted to tie her up myself. With a noose. <br/><br/>21. At least they perfectly matched the soundtrack with the manipulative lead character.<br/><br/>22. Unbelievably, this makes the similarly disastrous Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor look competent. Score one for Tyler Perry. Sadly.<br/><br/>23. I always say, ""To each their own, as long as it doesn't harm another."" Way to go, America, for eating up this horrible crap with unredeemable characters that set women back 90 years.<br/><br/>24. It's one thing to be introduced to a bumbling and tripping fool of a character, but for her to go around and around in circles and barely learn a single thing for two hours is just exhausting. But, in the movie's defense, it really does make you want her beaten up by the end. Preferably non-sexually.<br/><br/>25. Spoiler Alert! The truly laugh-out-loud, writer-just-gave-up ending was Pretty Woman, but without a climax, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings, but without the yearning for chapter two and The Matrix Reloaded with knowledge of what's coming next. It seriously reminded me of Wile E. Coyote falling off a cliff and holding a sign that read ""How about ending this cartoon before I hit?"""
"chilichilipepper","3","8","15","22 February 2015"," An honest review (from a male perspective)
","Now, some disclaimers. I am not one of the people who give movies a 1 that I don't like, or a 10 for ones I like. I have rated very few movies as a 10. And none as a one (in fact, I think this is my lowest rating ever) That being said, I am not the target demographic for this movie but my girlfriend wanted to see it. She enjoyed the book, but isn't a huge fanatical fan about it. So well, we went and saw the movie and even she agrees that it was a piece of junk.<br/><br/>First off, it completely ridicules the BDSM culture. I'm not a ""member"" per ce, except for some light handcuffs and spanking stuff, but I do know enough from having friends involved in the culture that this film is basically to the BDSM community what tons of other movies have portrayed gays, lesbians, blacks, insert stereotype here in a negative light. It was astoundingly insulting (and in the FAQ here, the reason is answered quite thoroughly) Second, the acting was atrocious. The actors made Keanu Reeves look like an Oscar winner. The script, from what my girl said, was fairly faithful to the book (which I don't know what says it better: that this book is that terrible that the film was faithful, or that the film was faithful to a terrible book?"" Third, the pacing , directing, and overall whole movie had the feel of a high school production. There was not a single moment where I had any personal investment into any of the characters and due to the wooden acting I really didn't care about anything that was happening. In short, I watched it and the entire time I just waited for the end.<br/><br/>I cannot believe this movie pulled in 400 million world wide and is still going semi strong. And as I said above, I'm not the target demographic for this movie, being a 40 year old male. However, my girlfriend hated the movie even more than I did (and she's right in the target age group).<br/><br/>Overall, don't waste your time. I give it 3 stars generously. Really, it is a terrible movie. I might actually read the book just to see the comparison, but if like my girlfriend said it is pretty similar to the movie, I don't know if I want to waste my time twice."

","50 shades of Grey was both a waste of time and money, i recommend if you just wait until it comes out on DVD. As someone who refused to read the books. I had decided to see what the fuss was about by watching the movie with a friend. By 15 minutes in i found myself scrolling through my Facebook and twitter feeds because i was downright BORED!!!. But i suppose if you enjoy dreadful acting, the occasional nipple scene, an unrealistic and predictable plot then this here movie is for you!. I had a curiosity to see if i would find this movie sexy the way i know many women found the book but unfortunately i did not, the girl who played the main character was not nearly as good looking as she could have been and neither was the male lead. The casting for this movie was poorly done and it really showed, i found when 'Christian' was supposed to be sexy he kind of looked... well... constipated.

","It is apparent that the director and the writer of 50 Shades of Grey have never been anywhere near a Dom/sub relationship in their life, let alone be authoritarian enough to make a film about one. As a person who has been both a dominant and a submissive I am appalled that this film even pretends to discuss the envelope this world is seeded in. From the wildly unbelievable characters, and their increasingly irritable incomprehension of each other to the childish explanations for such relationships and complete lack of integrity in any scene presented makes 50 Shades of Grey about 51 points from even coming close to being a 101 on Dom/Sub relations. <br/><br/>This film is nothing more than a conservative judgment call and an attack on a world that they clearly demonstrated they know absolutely nothing about the fundamentals of, let alone any whipper of insight. <br/><br/>One star out of five...

","I saw it last night and I did not like it but not for the reason I was expecting. The film has a technical story telling issue in that is has no ending whatsoever, but what bothered me is much deeper than that. <br/><br/>When I took my wife to see this I thought I would get an inside glimpse into the secret fantasies of middle-aged women. I thought the popularity of this story was an admission that women secretly want to be dominated. What I found out was the true fantasy of women is to annoy a man into changing, and that fantasy is the main appeal of this story. <br/><br/>The male character in this movie I actually somewhat respected for the first half of the film, he was very clear and direct about what he wanted, so clear that he put it in writing. The female character would constantly follow the same pattern of agreeing to what he wants then complaining about it until he changes. The entire film is simply watching this pattern on repeat until the story ends with no conclusion. <br/><br/>For those wanting insight into the female psyche I would avoid this movie, I don't think you will like what you find."

And if it were the slightest bit more intense than bondage and spanking, they'd harp on how revolting it was. To my mind, yes, there was no overarching plot, but then again not all successful romance movies have had to have that, and it was the first installment in a trilogy, so the build-up should be understandable. It's a BDSM story, after all, isn't it?<br/><br/>And the acting? It was beyond reproach. The chemistry between Dakota and Jamie? It was absolutely stunning. The only catch is that the storyline sounded flat and not fully developed, but maybe that's the point? Maybe that's a new subgenre of romance?"

","As the heroes journey has no bearing here, it's the one 'who is now' which angers men for making their journey in betterment not factoring in. Dakota Johnson is so sensitive that her affect swallows the screen through performer empathy. The choice for internal not external is perfect for subjective literarism so the film gets lost inside her mind and nearly can't swim out. It's incredible how she sells every beat. She hangs onto the safeness of the role for dear life to remain endearing, and bravely crosses into eroticism which is very strange for pop cinema, as in they thought the popularity of the book was really about sexuality, not power, so it comes off extremely awkward. The man is less exceptional and I wonder how someone might have sold the character into an artform, where every scene you read nuance and interpretation creating a calculus puzzle between them. That her sexuality is the only thing she can offer is what disappoints men who accuse the female hero fantasy of sitting around, doing nothing, and getting some great reward for it. How the self-insert myths clash is very much 'war of the sexes.' Of course that is the surface reading and arguable. See the way she attempts to reverse engineer him through his kinks is anything but passive; and the way the story infuses sexuality being the person 'inside out' is a serious cinematic study that allows Dakota Johnson to larp as a believable subject for Bertolucci or Lyne. With the female director Sam Taylor it's admirable work inventing all of this for seeing. Often cultural phenomenons breach great truth and warrant a serious contrarian's look; in spite of its box office power hints on an artform there which she mines for through those awkward sex scenes which belong better on the page. This was awkward because it attempts the literary and puts in a serious effort to discover the cinema there; the director attempts to earn the brand, whereas the polished streamlined sequels by Foley went down too easily as commercial products. Meaning this shows a process to good or bad."

"roseswest","10","12","25","2 March 2016"," Powerful! Deep! Real!
","I was intrigued to see this because of all the bad reviews and the one good one. I thought this movie was great and had great depth. There was good chemistry between them. She was healthy and loved herself enough to say no. He had never met anyone that he couldn't control and had feelings for. He was obviously in need of healing from all the abuse he suffered, and she gave him a taste of what real love is, and set boundaries of what she would and wouldn't accept. She was not seduced by his wealth and power. In real life, I believe people are attracted to others because they trigger unhealed issues within them. She gave him an opportunity to begin to reevaluate his behavior and childhood abuse. She opened his heart as much as he could allow and triggered an opportunity to begin to heal if he so chose. Everything in this movie was consensual between them which confirms our own free choice and what we are willing and unwilling to accept. People can only abuse you if you allow them to. Real love is not abusive. I thought this movie was important and a mirror for all of us in relationships. I admire her strength for being able to walk away and say no, despite her attraction, desire, and love for him. There are great lessons here for anyone who truly wants a healthy and loving relationship and healing of their past issues, which will always follow us into the next relationship until we do the real work of facing, dealing, releasing, and healing our own issues and needs for love. For anyone who has no interest in that, then this is not the movie for you. Relationships are powerful mirrors and an opportunity to heal and evolve. It was a powerful relationship, one in which each will be forever changed and forced to look within. If you are only interested in a superficial, feel good relationship and unwilling to do the deep inner work, I can see why you wouldn't like this movie. I loved it! It was nice to see something real.

","If you are considering watching this for any other reason than to jack off at the movie theater, kindly save your money for something more worthwhile. This is a shameless effort by Hollywood to justify porn as something resembling a work of art or story. Porn is not made to be artistic, neither is it made to do be beautiful, it is meant to stimulate the brain towards sexual passion. Nothing more, nothing less. Watching this would be no different than visiting RedTube in a dark room alone with a bottle of lotion and some tissues. <br/><br/>As an avid writer, I can tell you that one thing has remained true no matter what form it embodied: pornographic content does nothing to benefit story. Sex scenes, passionate love scenes, naked men and women, none of it does anything to create a decent story. The only reason people see movies like this is because of something famously called ""sex appeal"". Want more people to see your movie regardless of how bad it is? Throw in some cleavage and scantily-clad women!<br/><br/>Why would I, a guy, say such a preposterous thing to regular porn viewers who see it as ""okay"" or ""acceptable""? Because believe it or not, porn is wrong. Crazy, right? It twists the mind and turns women and men into nothing more than tools for your pleasure, instead of the beautiful humans beings they are on the inside, complete with personalities and virtues that are of greater value than their breast size, waist curvature, or penis circumference. Women and men are complex beings just like you and I, and obviously they do not want to be treated like a filthy rag that you only use when you need it most. By purchasing a ticket for 50 Shades of Grey, or even liking it on Facebook, you are telling everyone that you have little respect for women and men alike, and that your pleasure is more important that the lives of an entire gender.<br/><br/>Do not watch 50 Shades of Grey. Do not justify it as ""mommy porn"" or ""wholesome media"", because it is neither. It is trash, even worse, it is a foul disease. Avoid it like you would the Bubonic plague (or Ebola, more fitting), because it will do nothing to benefit your life other than destroy the intimate, beautiful relationship that you might otherwise have with a significant other. When someone asks you if you are seeing 50 Shades of Grey, tell them, ""No, I can watch porn at home, and for free."" and then shock the world by not watching porn and maybe talking to someone of the opposite gender to get to know them without the ultimate goal being to sleep with them. You'd be shocked at how meaningful the world becomes when everything is not about sex. <br/><br/>Let's show Hollywood that we want the art that cinema can be, and not the lowest form of ""entertainment"" that we as humans have seen fit to create."

","First things first, I read the books. I honestly found some parts of the books annoying, the over-usage of certain words, the sophomoric writing, repetition of various incidents throughout the entire trilogy blah blah blah... But most importantly, I loved Ana and Christian's love story. I know it's been speculated that the books have no plot, but that's just a debatable matter. The fact that Christian transforms throughout the books is plot enough for me. <br/><br/>I wanted to love the movie so badly. I wanted it to work, just to shove it on the faces of haters, BUT I'm not going to lie to myself, I did not enjoy the film AT ALL. <br/><br/>Personally I thought Dakota tried really hard to give us the best version of Ana, and I appreciate that, but more often than not, it just didn't work for me. Jamie on the other hand...I mean, really now? In every part of the film, I cringed whenever he had to say something. I get that he's Irish (right?) and his American accent isn't necessarily on point, but surely that doesn't justify the fact that he 'sounded like he was rehearsing his lines 99% of the time' (in my opinion). The movie is based on a love story of two individuals who fall in love with each other , yet, when Ana (Dakota) confessed her love to Christian at the end of the film, I couldn't help but wonder, ""When did that happen?"" From reading the book, it's almost like love at first sight for the two characters, yet when they first met, I couldn't wait for the meeting to end (it was that horrible). Bottom line, I didn't witness any chemistry between the two whatsoever. <br/><br/>What happened to mercurial Mr Grey, the control freak we all hate to love, Mr 'I F#ck Hard', the tortured guy who meets the love of his life? I did not see him. <br/><br/>I really did want to enjoy the movie...so very much. I wanted it to portray accurately (not perfectly) what I read from the book, but what I saw was not even close to Fifty Shades. And the S.E.X, isn't that what drew most of us to the book in the first place? Yet, what I saw was a tad of Ana's a$$, boobs and pubic hair. And miraculously five seconds of Christian's a$$. Other than that, it was Ana's accelerated breaths and writhing pale body that slightly depicted the sexual content of the book. I was hoping to see the dark dominant I've read about, but what I got was a hot Irish model who didn't seem to know anything about BDSM.<br/><br/>Hopefully the second one doesn't disappoint as much. That's all.<br/><br/>Sadly, A disappointed fan."

","So , first things first , i was not going to watch this movie. I had no plans at all. People told me that the book had some pathetic writing ( understandable since it's a twilight fan fiction ) and i didn't bother much about the movie too. But it was close to the release date when a lot people around me were super excited about the movie and couldn't stop about how good this movie was going to be , which is when i changed my mind , and boy , it was a really bad decision.<br/><br/>First of , this is an ambitious project with little to no context trying to build up a story arc and cash in some money from the fans of the book and i guess the only thing that helps the movie stand on it's feet is Dakota playing the lead as Anastasia Steele who is a student of literature trying to get a few stories and roundabouts of famous personalities. There are specific reasons why the movie has got a very bad rating from me and I will also explain why it has received any rating at all .<br/><br/>1 ) Story :- Now the movie's plot is kiddish and mediocre. If you thought Jupiter Ascending was a linear plot wait till you get a load of this. The story revolves around a literature student Anastasia Steele who gets a golden opportunity to interview a millionaire business tycoon Christian Grey, all because her friend ( who was supposed to do the interview ) fell sick, such convenience. So the plot continued , giving exposition on it's way , spelling out Christian's life piece by piece , telling us about his character which gradually evolves into a rude and self obsessed sex addict who wants to play a dominant role during his sex play. The movie is a perfect "" how to make clich√© "" book. The plot is extremely linear as it progresses and i must say the director had the courage to give a stupid cliffhanger at the end of the movie teasing a potential sequel in the near future. And as you watch the movie you can easily draw the similarities between this story and that of twilight. Nearly every character in this universe can be associated with the Twilight one. Christian with Edward , Anastasia with Bella and there are lot of parts in the movie which seem like it's completely ripped off from twilight. ( which is a bad thing ) <br/><br/>2 )Casting and Characters :- Casting in this movie is bad , downright stupid. The only character i guess who stands out in the whole movie is Anastasia ,who is played brilliantly by Dakota. Dakota's acting is perfect and she does her best to portray herself as a dynamics et piece in this rather dumb plot. It can be clearly witnessed how Dakota's performance though good didn't flesh out well as the character she was playing was shallow and had absolutely no proper introduction, depth of realization or even a subtle back-story or motive. On the other hand is the man of the movie Christian Grey played by Jamie Dornan, who manages to single handedly bring Dakota's performance down to the ground. Let me be serious about this fact here. This movie is about relationships , and if you expect any kind of chemistry between them you would be surprised to see none here. Christian tries to be dominant and acts the way the script tells him to making him look like he is forced to act out the actions he does. His character is more of a burden for a viewer over the already burdened plot. There is absolutely no connection between the two characters and the couple didn't resonate their vibe perfectly the way the audience would have expected. On a whole Dakota yes, others , hell no.<br/><br/>3 ) Direction :- To be frank I had absolutely no clue about the director of this movie Sam Taylor Johnson. I haven't watched any of her previous projects nor have I heard of her works. And for the very first viewing of her film , I can say with complete assurance that she has her own artistic angle to her direction making nearly every shot as vibrant as possible. Every single scene of this movie ( though named fifty shades of Grey ) was vibrant in every aspect. Colours were overflowing on the screen with lighting captured perfectly with a subtle touch of minimized lens flares. Sam Taylor has the ability and talent I can say to create beautifully shot moments in a movie but can fail terribly to create an atmosphere suitable for the characters to evolve and grow with the plot. One of the best examples of other talented but snubbed directors i can give is Steven Shainberg who directed the movie secretary. It had more or less the same plot as this but the direction allowed the characters to grow on the audience making them understand and feel for them.<br/><br/>On a whole Fifty Shades Of Grey is nowhere close to the hype it was building up. The story is mediocre and clich√© in many levels with blunt protagonist Christian Grey, and a relationship that feels forced with no context from both ends. There are only 3 reasons according to me why one should watch this movie.<br/><br/>a ) Dakota's performance <br/><br/>b) Recognition of the director Sam Taylor Johnson who has the ability and talent subdued by this movie <br/><br/>c ) Some sleep"

","From my side its hard to describe best or worst but I am %100 percent clear that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. <br/><br/>First of all I am not against the BDSM but this movie shows us how to rape and emotionally abuse women and act like problem guy and get ""ahhh he had some problem then he become like that"". What an empathy! And some of people whom like the movie says next movie She will torture him and end of the series they will marry and have a child. What a crap! <br/><br/>I did not read the book and I thought that this movie is about seduction state between powerful guy and vulnerable weak girl But while I watch the movie my face turned Tarantino's face which is sour facial expression when you eat lemon. <br/><br/>This movie is insult and this book is too. This crime is being done for women but There was a few guy in cinema hall, only girls whom as thirsty as Bedouin and funny things is that they all satisfied about it(I mean most of them).I have heard the whispers. <br/><br/>The writer is about fifty years old and probably her mechanism doesn't work at all. That's fine that she fantasies about harsh stuff but She cant use it with a girl whom is maiden. That's made me about this movie or the subject horrified. <br/><br/>Ps:that's why I love trier and I like nymphomaniac very much. It disturbing as every trier movie but its logical."

","If you've read the books you're expecting a lot of steaming sex, bdsm and luxurious environments. And that's exactly what you'll see in this movie. I was a bit afraid that the producers should romanticize it but no, it's exactly like the book. Dakota Johnson is absolutely perfect as Anastasia Steele, the virgin college student who meets the dominant business man Christian Grey. Jamie Dornan is handsome and very sexy with intense eyes. Maybe a little bit stiff (I'll forgive him for that). <br/><br/>Something that I really appreciates is that they've brought a little bit of humor in the movie. <br/><br/>Looking forward for the next two movies."

","I never wanted to read the books but I saw the movie. Fifty Shades of Grey is Twilight, without the religious cr**, sorry to say but the relationships in Twilight didn't feel genuine or plausible - supernatural aspects aside - and thank goodness she doesn't wait four books to put out. The film is sensual, not sexual even thought there are b**bs, bushes, and f-ing in it. It's a BDSM love story that reeks of teenage drama and desperation but it's still fun to watch, what does that say about?<br/><br/>Sam Taylor-Johnson delivered a tasteful movie despite the dicey subject. Fifty Shades is well shot, the cinematography is beautiful and luminescent - sorry about that word - literally bringing to light BDSM practices. She suggested sex without showing it, to be honest she showed quite a bit. But once again, the movie is sensual and not arousing - at least, it didn't arouse me. Taylor-Johnson also got some pretty surprising performances out of her actors. Jaime Dornan and Dakota Johnson were surprisingly very good.<br/><br/>Jamie Dornan is exceedingly good in this role, not that he is a bad actor, but I wasn't sure he could pull it off. He does though, he plays mysterious and domination well, and also clearly shows how Christian Grey loves the crack the whip. Dakota Johnson as the young and innocent Bella, I mean Anastasia is brilliant, she probably would have been a better Bella than Kristen Stewart - sorry but it's kind of true. <br/><br/>I hope Dakota Johnson had a hell of a pay day out of this movie because however tasteful it is, she's naked a lot in this film.<br/><br/>Chessy dialogues and unnecessary innuendos aside, Fifty Shades of Grey is not that bad.<br/><br/>@wornoutspines"

The plot where a young girl meets a boy with a certain kind of interest when it comes to sex. To u out there writing 1 star comments please make yourself familiar with what movie you're about to watch before raging all over IMDb. The story is about a guy with these types of interests. He's not a romantic type, he likes BDSM. If you google that movie u can read clearly that it's not a typical ""romance"" movie, but quite the opposite. Fine it was not what u thought it would be but that's not the movies fault it's yours. So don't go and give it 1-stars because u don't know what movie you're about to see, that's just retarded.<br/><br/>Otherwise I think that it was very good, it had good filming and solid acting. Could get a bit repetitive at times but apart from that it was good. I watched this with my girlfriend on valentines day and we both thought it was good. <br/><br/>So if you're familiar with the story and want to watch a movie about this kind of stuff, i can recommend this movie for you."

","Saw pretty early on the much buzzed about ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" film I wanted to even though I hadn't read any of the E.L. James novels. Well I must say for the most part I was impressed as the film did have a story and it tried it's best to show relationship and chemistry between the two characters as it did deliver on it's theme showcase of plenty of sex, skin, bondage, and domination it was plenty for the eyes! A good film if you like to see little sex games! I guess the story in the books are much the same, anyway a college student Anastasia Steele(Dakota Johnson)a virgin is a girl getting ready to start to life out in the real world of work and relationship well that gets off to a big lift when she meets a business guy named Christian Grey(Jamie Dornan)the passion and seduction soon begins. As it's a take flight romance of control and hot sexual games that features bondage, rope, blindfolds and tie ups for Anastasia. Even though the scenes are not X they still are hot and go deep for an R picture with the nudity and skin! This picture sends a message that all of us have a sexual nature and a side domination and control that needs to be discovered and enjoyed with someone it proves that being erotic can lead to love."
"FlickChick82","7","21","50","11 February 2015"," Better than the book
","It is good, there isn't one extra scene or out of place. The only thing that comes to mind is underused sex scenes and a particular scene which takes place in the garden. The focus is on the leads and this leaves other characters looking like extras but that's fine by me. The script is so much better than the book, all the lines are perfect. While reading the books, Anastasia would usually get on my nerves, but it's entirely different story watching this character on screen. She is already in this first installment of the trilogy a confident, strong person, unlike in the books, where we get to see that transformation in the third book. Chemistry between Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson is there, that's for sure, perhaps not an animal kind of attraction, but it's palpable. Both actors have done an amazing job in this movie, so well, that I truly became interested into finding out whether there could be future for them or not, even though I knew how it all unfolds because I had read the books. I also liked the ending and am curious to see the sequel. I would recommend this even to those who haven't read the books."

They have taken an R rated book and turned it into a M15 lifeless exercise in boredom.<br/><br/>There is zero chemistry between the two main characters The sex scenes are so tame that it leaves little point to the rest of the story as it was very thin to begin with.<br/><br/>Because of the M15 rating rather than R as it should have been it means that all the sex scenes have really choppy editing as they couldn't show any full frontal nudity. It also meant that when there is spanking done they can't actually show her being hit.<br/><br/>Please don't make the next two books into films as I really don't want to have my next two valentines day evenings wasted with drivel like this."

","I thought the director did a phenomenal job at bringing the story to the screen. I know that's going to ruffle feathers but if you read and understood the true meaning of the story you would understand that this was not meant to be a lovey dub-by romance at all this was a story about a creepy guy who learns to fall in love with a very innocent person. If you walked into the theater expecting Cinderella your gonna be disappointed. This is not your typical love story it is dark and messy and may not be for everyone. Many people complained about the lack of chemistry but they are not supposed to have chemistry! Its a I want to control you and I am in love with you relationship.

"njoy828","7","11","23","14 February 2015"," Perfectly Average. Degrading? Stop making people feel ashamed about having a sexual appetite.
","I went in with extremely low expectations. I watch movies and TV shows with sex/violence & whatnot, so it would take a lot to make me uncomfortable. <br/><br/>Good Points:<br/><br/>No Narrating<br/><br/>Right off the bat, I appreciated that there was no narrating. 9/10 times a movie based on a book has narration ‚Äì most movies botch the narrating. I'm not dumb, I can watch and comprehend.<br/><br/>Directing <br/><br/>Not too shabby at all. Had a solid mood, it was taking itself seriously and didn't overdo things. Music/shots all OK. <br/><br/>Acting<br/><br/>Durnan's (Grey) character and acting was perfectly understandable. He actually had lines, unlike what I was expecting. I felt that there could, potentially, be a guy out there that acts this way. He had quirks, but there was nothing strange/alien about his behavior. Even the way he presented his fetish was very matter of fact - this is what he likes and that's all there is to it. I assumed that the way women in this movie would act around him was going to be comical; most simply acknowledge that he is handsome and successful ‚Äì but he's not someone to throw yourself at. My assumptions from the hype was that women, - for lack of a better term - ""can't even"" just by looking at this guy and this will highlight how weak women are and blah blah bullshit. <br/><br/>Johnson (Ana) sold me. She was a mousy girl, she wasn't some blubbering idiot like a lot of the reviews I've read seem to state. She had personality, she wasn't some moron that didn't have a point of view. Ana was particularly taken by Grey in a way where she felt an attraction that she hasn't felt before. I'm not sure why her attraction/intrigue towards him and his fetish's automatically equal to her then being 'a weak woman'. It's even more insulting to call a woman weak just for being curious and turned on by someone in a way where she feels overwhelmed. I don't see why people need to be ashamed of what turns them on. People act like these feelings doesn't occur ever in life - it certainly does. <br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>I thought the plot was going to be laughable, I only laughed when laughing was due. I certainly didn't think it's the best written script or the best plot, but it was interesting. Grey and Ana's relationship didn't seem like some kind of otherworldly romance, it was just your basic complicated relationship, particularly cause this guy has very specific fetishes. I went in not knowing anything about the fetish and came out thinking that it is a perfectly understandable sexual appetite to have. Sex is so overly hyped that anything to do with sexuality is way too taboo for people to even function normally. Look at how Americans react to being LGBTQ. I found this movie progressive in highlighting that sex is multifaceted. Why be ashamed of sex and sexual habits/fetishes, if the party's involved are consenting, where's the harm?<br/><br/>Sex<br/><br/>The reviews that keep claiming this is rape, I'd like to define rape for you: rape is when an individual that is not consenting and is forced into being apart of a sexual act. Rape, by the way, is not exclusive to women. There was not a solitary instance in which Grey forced Ana to do things beyond her will. He even took the measure of drawing up a contract in order to have her consent (the paperwork wasn't properly signed because they were 'breaking rules' she verbally ‚Äì explicitly would give consent towards everything). He had her do research, both negotiated on what she is/is not into. He did not shy away from stating exactly what he wants. I thought feminist and the like always rage that men don't know how to get consent and pressure women into everything, this man is being 100% transparent about what he wants, what he would like to do and is letting her decide if she would like to engage or not. Even, at the very end, a brutal ""punishment"" occurs, only because - of her own volition - she wanted to experience it. Please note, I'm not saying that women or anyone should be ""punished"" but, if you are explicitly asking for something, you are responsible for thinking about its repercussion before engaging in something you don't like. For instance, take someone who has never had sushi, they hate the smell, the idea of raw stuff etc., but, if the person then states, ""But I just want to try it, to see what it's all about"" - fully aware that this is something they may not like ‚Äì they've committed to trying it, and if it's found foul, they stop eating it. The individual wouldn't then claim that the sushi is responsible for being so ""mysterious"" that it left you no choice but to try it. The sushi never lied about being sushi.<br/><br/>Sex scenes: In the theater I went to; pin drop silence. Everyone was interested in what is about to happen. <br/><br/>Bad points:<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was the weakest, I couldn't grasp what was special about Grey to Ana's character it felt forced- but that fact doesn't mean that there isn't a story happening. <br/><br/>Conclusion: <br/><br/>My reaction was 'wait, what... it's over? But..."" I realized that I was into the story and liked the resolution. I felt humbled because I had all these prejudices going in, in the end, I had a good time and am looking forward to the sequel.<br/><br/>There are far worse movies out there. This was a movie about a relationship that is overwhelming for both involved. Both felt confused/uncertain and excited. This film told their story well."

","This movie... is just awful. The books were awful already so I guess I couldn't really expect anything different. But this film is really just the romanticized version of rape. This has nothing to do with actual BDSM, it's abuse in its finest form. What this movie does is pretty much encourage rape as well as tell guys that no doesn't necessarily mean no and could really just mean yes. I just hope that no couples went to see this movie to ""try out something new"" in the bedroom. Always remember that you need CONSENT!!

"jfdadalt","1","7","13","20 February 2015"," Many shades of errors part 1
","As widely expected the movie on the first part of the trilogy was a success in terms of audience just after release. Does it really deserve all that credit? Sincerely, not. I waited a whole week before going to theater to watch it, looking for a calmer and less crowded room, and this way I would have already been reading comments in the media over the movie, pros and cons.<br/><br/>In general, movie adaptations of books require a huge and thorough work so each character's identity and personality are kept with integrity. From the perspective of someone who has not read the book, E.L. James work can be seriously threatened with a bad vision, casting doubts on whatever has led to such an explosion of her books sells. Many articles has been written to analyze and explain Ms. James's success, henceforth leaving room for doubts only over who indeed made the movie. I am not going any further down this road because the movie is indeed awful, full of meaningless conversations and poorly describing the edge between drama and romance that can be so easily felt by reading Ms. James's books.<br/><br/>From the point of view of those who actually read the romance, the situation is dreadful, a real catastrophe. Hollywood was unable to reproduce the story, showing the opposite: it has given us a lesson on how to destroy a good script. It is true that the main factor drawing attention to the books of Christian Grey is how the sexual relationship between him and Anastasia Steele evolves. Therefore, how could this movie be conceived as an adaptation of the book if sexual content was decreased in order to reduce censorship to attract more public? Isn't obvious that in this case much negative repercussion has to be generated? The issue here is that if sexual content is correctly portrayed in the movie, pornography becomes an inadequate categorization and should not reflect negatively on the actors, because with regard to this book, bringing their nudity exposed is necessary for immersive ends. The decision on not to show a frontal nude of Christian Grey was a bad start.<br/><br/>Adaptation ended up with severe mutilations that will compromise links with the remaining books, shall the trilogy is indeed recorded. Mainly between the first and the second books as nothing was explored with regard to Anastasia's job interviews and the SIP. Yes, this is key to put spectators in the problems of the second book and the conclusion of the third. A huge error on adaptation, from the movie's director to the very Ms. James who allowed this absurd amputation to happen. How will this be preserved in the following works I have no idea, although some corrections are possible.<br/><br/>Is it possible that this and other ""cuts"" have the purpose to just make something that resembles the book so that in just two hours of timespan it makes possible to increase the number of times the movie is exhibited in a day, thus yielding more money? Couldn't just 30 more minutes of movie track fit to make any sense of what the characters and their psychological conditions are? <br/><br/>The movie is wrong since the beginning when Ana interviews Christian. It seems that the people who made the movie have not read the whole trilogy, or if they did, they did it probably while driving in traffic and without paying much attention. That interview deserves attention if there is any intent to make Christian's perspective of it too as Ms. James made it in the end of the third book. If there is no will to construct that part of the third book then yes, there is no need to focus on that interview much, but if they do it, I can only feel sorry of how this will be showed up.<br/><br/>Adaptation of the book to the screens should have kept more dialogues between Ana and Kate, fulfilling the need of more scenes to make spectators acquainted to Ana's problems. This way people could also feel more immerse and feel the characters, especially when a movie is not about action such as this one. Not to mention some chronological steps that became inverted in the movie generating confusion and loss of sense.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no room here to show many majors of those barbaric mistakes.<br/><br/>I do not know what has been planned for the next movies, if they are ever made. I must confess that in order to fix up the whole thing this first part should be thrown to garbage, as it is rubbish, and must be remade. Maybe the best could be to look for a European director, one that is more compromised with art. A helpful thing could be to look for one or two critical readers of this trilogy in order to help build these movies because it seems, again, that the people who made this first one did not read anything or if they did, did not paid much attention on key elements that help to put the story into context. For example, where is the big ""U""-shaped sofa in Christian's living room that is necessary for the family to sit and wait for him while he is disappeared in the second book?<br/><br/>Make a ""non-disclosure agreement"" with them but do not hesitate in doing so ;-). There are plenty of nice and more sophisticated things that can be done to save and make the movies more just to the original books without consuming too much of spectators' time. It is possible to save the horrible movie you have done already. I put myself at your disposal if you like as the first thing I want for everyone is a good movie and people like me, who enjoyed so much this book and read it more than once undoubtedly has the means to give you different and valued opinions and perspectives."

","I have read the book and out of all movies that are based on books, I thought this one was portrayed the best considering what type of book they had to work with! At first I wasn't fond of the casting when I watched the preview because I pictured Christian Grey as a dark haired gorgeous eyed beauty but once I watched the film I don't think that they could have picked any better now! Jamie Dornan did an amazing job as Christian Grey and really showed his personality and emotions. I was very satisfied with the humour of the film as well. I do not think this movie is very romantic however nor is it meant to be like a lot of people think. It is 2 people trying to fuse together a relationship from two very different approaches. Like a lot of people who can't help but fall in love despite the differences of wants and needs. Christian Grey has layers to him which unfold throughout the movie which keeps you engaged and curious in his character. You see the power he holds and then as the film continues you see that Ana is gaining more power over him. There is a lot more to this film than just sex. All this talk about abuse, blah blah, it is consensual and she agrees and disagrees to what she wants and he respects that! He has a secretive dark past like a lot of people in this world. If people could just see that and not just rate this movie 1/10 because of the sexuality of the film. Overall, I was very impressed and cannot wait for the next part of the film!

It is certainly not the whole basis of the movie - neither was it the whole point of the book. It is a seriously good film.

The book is definitely not the greatest literature, and even being a fan, I admit that the writing fails several times and it is not the book you exactly want to tell everybody proudly you read it...but f**k that...it's for our pleasure. Of course, there are many people who don't enjoy, or don't take any pleasure of it. Some will say that it's a smooth porn, others will tell that the BDSM's scenes are too sweet to be really close to what it is, and you will find those hating Anastasia being hit by a rich guy with a strange taste.

Funny several times, has hot scenes, but it's not a porn. The book is not a porn, so as the movie. If you are expecting to see some 'parts' of the cast: forget it. Like I said...it's not a porn. Only Anastasia gets more of her body exposed, but you won't see her womb...it's pointless...although I think she could have shaved her low countries lol. The soundtrack was pretty good, the cast acting got over all of my fears, although I have not enjoyed the chosen actors for Kate, Eliot and Mia. Jamie and Dakota has given life to Christian and Anastasia in a way much better acting than I was expecting. The movie, I would dare to say, has the power to conquer even those who did not read the book...but of course, you have to keep your mind opened and, please, stop creating monsters over this simply and catching story. If you allow yourself, you might find out that this movie is actually nice and enjoy the rest of the story. Hope my 'not professional' opinion serves you well."

","The movie wasn't bad. People here have over-sensationalized the movie; parroting to the tune of what the popular media machine wants them to believe. I am a woman (young and not middle aged I am in my 20's) and this movie was not degrading. It is a powerful love story between a man and a woman and it shows how love helps shape two people to create a unified whole. <br/><br/>There have been worse movies out there namely; ""Pretty Woman"" that degrade women as a whole. ""Pretty Woman"" offered audiences a look at glamorizing prostitution like there was some pot of gold at the end of the prostitution rainbow. Any Disney princess movie degrades women (young and old) on a larger eclectic whole by teaching young women that only the beautiful get their dreams to come true; such an American sentiment. <br/><br/>I have recommended that the only fault of this movie is to read the books. If you want to feel more in touch with these characters than reading the books is needed. Many average individuals no longer pick up a book to read and you surely are missing out on this story if you don't read. No book to film adaptation is perfect. If you want to go watch a love story that isn't your typical sort of love; this is your movie."

","People are misunderstanding the plot of the story. There is no abuse or rape whatsoever in the story and it wasn't in the movie either. These are all consenting adults. Also people are mad about Christian's past which was not shown in the movie. Whoever has read the book, will have to admit that Christian redeems himself in book 2 and 3. Christian's character changes after the break up. At the end of book 1, he is portrayed as a heartless monster, and that is what they showed in the movie. Which is how it's supposed to be. I don't think that should have been a big deal. I admit some important scenes were not in the movie (the boathouse conversation and the hotel conversation in bed in Georgia). But hey for a 2 hour long movie, it should not be expected."

","Before I begin my review I would like to say that I have not read all of the books yet. I am currently reading book one. Also, keep in mind that this is my personal opinion and I am by no means trying to offend anyone. Now for my review of the movie: <br/><br/>I believe this was a great movie. It exceeded my expectations. I had no yet began the book when I saw it and I was basically expecting lots of sex and not a very great storyline. But, to my surprise, it actually had an extremely intriguing storyline! It was very interesting to see a dominant type of person, almost a dominatrix. Jamie played a wonderful Christian Grey because he portrayed that dominant character but he also showed that he was being changed by Anastasia. It was quite interesting to learn of him being the way he Is because he has a mental issue due to basically being molested by an older lady when he was younger. I thought that Dakota played Anastasia perfectly because she showed how awkward yet curious Ana is in the book(now that I am reading it). I thought that, despite what many people have said, the two actors showed the exact chemistry they were supposed to. I have heard many people say that the movie did the book no justice, but to be completely blunt, DUH. Books are always better than movies, if the books are good( which in my opinion these books are great so far), because movies could not possibly fit all of the details and perspectives from a book into a movie.. Unless of course you would want to watch a six hour long movie with internal diegetic( hearing the actors thoughts but only so that the audience knows what they are thinking). I was absolutely hooked on this movie and I'm completely consumed with yearning to know what happens next. I believe people are being ridiculously picky when reflecting and reviewing the movie. It was overall a wonderful movie and people have way too high expectations of it in relation to the book. It followed the book as well as it could and , to be honest, it followed it pretty damn well. I am agitated at the fact that this movie has currently gotten a 4.1/10 rating when it deserves much better. Also, when movies get bad ratings, many times, they don't finish out the series. So I'm asking all who read this to please consider what I have said and reconsider your judgments and reviews of the movie so that you don't contribute to the possibility of them not finishing this wonderful series. It would ruin it for the people who actually truly enjoyed the movie, i.e. me, and who knows they might make the next two better than the first for those of you who critiqued the movie negatively! Thank you for taking your time to read this and I truly hope I have changed a few minds. Again, no offense was intended this was just a friendly opinion and interpretation of the movie and the reviews I have seen."

","I had low expectation, so I was delighted (as a result?) to find that the movie actually had me thinking philosophically, and moved me emotionally (primarily the female character). The depiction of the male protagonist was thin, but the depiction of the female had depth and was outstanding, and the sex scenes artfully done (and amusing when noticing the ways they kept it an 'R' rating).<br/><br/>The movie is as good a Hollywood gets (which, on a life scale, is about a '4') - but that is no fault of this movie - since it accurately reflects the deficiencies of our current cultural mindset (in all its deplorable un-glory), especially concerning sex - it depicts (by default) where our culture fails - on the art front and on the romantic/beauty front - where you live in a world where base sex is the norm. Here, they hit on three of the four crucial ingredients - mind-numbing physical attraction, the human-only high art possibilities, and the romance (which the story presents as THE main conflict). It misses on the 'miracle of new life' ingredient (but then there are two more installments - and I can't remember how the book ends), but then so does our current society, so not fault to the movie or story.<br/><br/>I 'listened' to the entire series in the car (my wife played the audiobook for me on long car trips), and I can authoritatively say that this movie takes the critical, and artful, qualities up many notches - it was not aimed at the housewife humping the washing machine - and it was restrained in plot tamperings (which is the norm for movies - but understandably, since it is hard to keep a creative screen writer down).<br/><br/>I see a lot of '1' reviews - which reflects the juvenile (and sheep-like) nature of the reviewers rather than the actual quality of the movie, which was a 10."

","When I found out about 3 years ago that they were making a movie I was trilled. Then they cast Charlie hunnam. Thankfully that didn't workout because Jamie Dornan nailed the part. I could not have asked for a better representation of the character Christian Grey being brought to life. Dakota Johnson did a great job as well. This story is very much a love story and they really showed the relationship development between Ana and Christian. Jamie played Christian in such a way that you have no choice but to love him. <br/><br/>And the humor....wow! I was not expecting it to be this humorous but it really completes it! I'm just thrilled with the result! I can't wait to see Fifty Shades Darker!!! Great job by the cast!!!"

For everyone putting doubts and hateful comments to the movie, it's just a movie. It's a love story between two characters that show love in a different way than others. Sam Taylor Johnson did a phenomenal job directing and portraying each scene with such magnificence. I give it a 10 over all! Go see the movie in theaters February 13, 2015! You will not regret it! Oh and another thing is that the protection and care Jamie and Dakota have for one another one set and off set was just amazing. There is nothing like it! I'm excited for 50 Shades Darker!

The actors are amazing, if you actually read the book then you will understand many things. Yes there is sex but honestly most adults that went to watch this movie was in there early 20's, i mean even old married couples went. Honestly it's so sad that so many people have brought down this book because of sex. Let's not forget about 'Deep Throat"" with Linda LoveLace, everyone went to see it and that was real porn. This wasn't even PORN PORN. It was what you would expect from a love movie... just a little more than Nicholas Sparks movie's sex scene (I saw the same making love scene they had in this movie in the notebook). You have to understand where Christian comes from and understand his story and then you can understand his choices. Ana chose all this and Ana chose to be with him and actually do some of his things, he even made sure she was okay with everything. The acting to me was fine. He had to have some of his accent. Christian has an accent in the book. Everyone has there right to state there reviews but honestly its not a bad movie. It's romance novel with a twist. You all have had sex before, everyone has... this movie isn't a shocker so honestly if you want to go see it go see it, don't let people pre judge you over something that is worth it.

"squirrel_burst","5","10","21","14 February 2015"," Will Everyone just calm down?
","I'm going to admit that I didn't have very high expectations when it came to ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". I went in figuring it would be quite the experience to see what I estimated would be a ridiculous erotic drama with a lot of sex, made for its audience of 30-something lonely housewives. Actually, and you can tell this is me telling the truth because I'm admitting this, the movie is better than you think it would be. I'd even recommend it if you're the audience it's targeting. The film stars Dakota Johnson as Anastasia ""Anna"" Steele, a naive woman who becomes infatuated with the world's most eligible billionaire, Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). There's drama aplenty when she discovers that Mr. Grey has a very peculiar sexual appetite.<br/><br/>I really thought that this picture was going to suck and that if anything, I'd get a kick out of it by chuckling to myself (quietly, to avoid being noticed by the adoring fans surrounding me on opening night) but I really was pleasantly surprised. At least on a technical level, this is a very competently made film with an eye for good cinematography, some decent erotic sequences and a story that leans more towards pleasurable than agonizing. What I didn't foresee was that whoever was in charge of putting this project together really knew what they were doing. It's as if they read the novel and instinctively knew that there would be some significant backlash towards the film simply for existing and they asked themselves ""what can we do to work around some of the weaknesses in this material?"" Firstly, I felt like director Sam Taylor-Johnson knew that to make the story (which is very melodramatic, and not in a good way towards the end) bearable, some humor had to be injected in it. I can't really give any examples off-hand, but the movie felt self aware. It knew that people were going to make fun of certain passages of dialog, so dodges a bullet by poking fun at itself. Not too much, just the right amount.<br/><br/>Even if you find that you have trouble swallowing the story and you can't stand the numerous sex scenes throughout, there won't be any denying that the cinematography present is quite good. There are three scenes that really stuck out for me. The first is a ""business meeting"" between Anna and Mr. Grey in which they are sitting in an office as the sun is setting. The diminishing sunlight peering through the windows and reflecting off of the glass table looked absolutely gorgeous. I loved seeing the warm glow reflect off of the two characters as they discussed their relationship in cold, calculated ways. The numerous sequences where Mr. Grey shows his would-be submissive some of the perks of living the high life were also very pleasing to the eye and there are a couple of shots where we see Jamie Dornan framed through objects that I thought showed a real eye for composition. Looking quickly at the cinematographer Seamus McGarvey's body of work, it comes to my attention that he's done a number of films. If I take one thing away from ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", it's that when I take a look at some of his works (which includes 2014's ""Godzilla"", ""Atonement"" and ""Anna Karenina"") I'll pay special attention to his shots.<br/><br/>The faults, I pin mostly on the original source material. It's pretty clear that this movie is based on an elaborate fantasy put onto paper that just happened to hit the right note with certain audiences. Like in so many of these quasy-abusive romance-driven stories we've gotten since ""Twilight"", the main character is plain, kind of dim and can easily be substituted for the reader. For this reason I didn't find myself to be particularly drawn into the romance in the plot. While I found Mr. Grey to be interesting because of his mysterious past and exotic tastes, the pure virginal Anna is so wishy-washy about what she wants that I came to strongly dislike her. At over two hours, this movie is also way too long. If I can learn everything I need to know about a world as wacky as the one in ""Existenz"" in 97 minutes, there's no reason for ""50 Shades"" to eat up this much of your time. On a personal note, I was also disappointed to see that there really aren't that many big, memorable scenes in the film aside from the erotic ones (which, surprisingly, didn't really do it that much for me, despite the ample nudity). People have been protesting this film because of ""sexual violence"" and ""deviant behavior"" but come on... really? This is not that scandalous when you consider that the internet has been around for how long now? This movie was not made for me. I saw hardly anything that even looked like a glimpse of anything resembling a giant monster, a time-traveler or a crazed serial killer. It doesn't really appeal to my more refined tastes of solid dramas and soul-crushing honesty with romance thrown in either. You already know if ""50 Shades of Grey"" is going to be for you based solely on what you know about the plot, even if it isn't much. The picture already gathered far more attention than it deserves because it doesn't strike me as particularly good or bad. For what it is though, it is well made and I do think that the legions of ladies who gobbled up the novel (or want to give hints that they might want to try some bondage themselves) will not feel like they wasted their time with it. In a way, I'm disappointed that viewing ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" on opening night was neither a catastrophe or a wildly erotic romp that ended up with me grabbing more phone numbers than I would know what to do with. Oh well. (Theatrical version on the big screen, February 12 2015)"

I enjoyed the romantic parts, they were cute. The leading actors did a wonderful job of portraying Christian and Anastasia. The female(let's call her Ana because I can't remember her real name) was the right mixture of awkward, and funny. She was pretty, and really gave emotions. You could tell when she had a ""what the bleep"" moment. Also the leading male. He was handsome, and as he put it ""fifty shades of bleeped up"". Overall it was a good experience.

I don't think anyone whose in the right mind would want to see this movie. The line between violence against women and sexual pleasure from torture is just so thin. So it is so hard for the public to distinguish whether this is an outcry of a middle age women or just promotion of sexually violence against women in general.

I enjoyed the dialog between Ana and Christian, the acting overall was pretty good. The sex scenes were pretty tamed compared to a typical book fans imagination. My biggest complaint overall is that they left out key character development moments and I hope they will release an uncut version to rectify this."
"Nodriesrespect","9","19","46","13 February 2015"," Christian Virtues
","Rarely has a movie elicited such heated controversy well before anyone actually had the opportunity to view it. Based on the first in an astonishingly bestselling series of novels by Erika Leonard (E.L. for short) James, its catchy title had already been punned to death (Fifty Shades of Chicken, anyone ?) prior to the ""official"" film version, numerous YouTube send-ups and unauthorized adult adaptations notwithstanding. Pretty much every aspect of the material would be endlessly debated, from casting choices to the tale's ""questionable"" sexual politics, prior to the movie hitting theaters just in time for Valentine's Day of 2015. I haven't read the books cause I'm a guy and when it comes to ""erotica"" I prefer pictures to the printed page. Rest assured that there will be plenty of other reviews (in fact there already are) to compare one to the other.<br/><br/>What pleases me most about the film is that it has singlehandedly ended the drought of big screen skin flicks. Porno palaces are but a distant memory nowadays and while there has certainly been a considerable display of nudity and (not always) simulated sex on art-house screens, it is rarely presented as a pleasurable experience, thereby reducing audience stimulation to nil. I fondly remember the heyday of the sadly late Zalman King, back in the '90s, when polished soft-core porn (though, it must be stressed, always told from a female point of view, courtesy of King's significant other Patricia Louisiana Knop) like TWO MOON JUNCTION and WILD ORCHID played to packed houses. When he withdrew to the more carnally conducive channels of cable TV, there was hardly anyone left to pick up the sexual slack at mainstream multiplexes. One notable exception was Canadian (of Armenian descent) Atom Egoyan who abandoned art-house for the lurid delights of CHLOE and WHERE THE TRUTH LIES. Yet at the end of the day, these were still men treading on a woman's turf, claiming to do her carnal bidding but prohibited from accurately adopting her gaze because of their gender.<br/><br/>Fifty Shades, the novel(s), has reclaimed literary eroticism for a female audience, hence the innumerable inferior spin-offs it has spawned to date. The movie attempts to achieve the same goal for its cinematic counterpart. Rumors of the book's graphic depictions being drastically toned down have not prevented yours truly from being pleasantly surprised at just how far an R-rating will stretch nowadays as this plays mighty close to NC-17. Another kicker was just how knowingly Kelly Marcel's solid screenplay toys with the genre's attendant clich√©s, starting with its impossibly glamorous setting (Christian Grey's offices peopled exclusively with eye-popping runway model types in identical tight-fitting business suits) and the lifestyles of the idle rich most of us can only dream of. One of porn's most enduring hallmarks is that it takes place in an idealized fantasy setting where no aspect of daily drudgery can detract from the sex and this film is all but an exception but still satirizes the concept simultaneously.<br/><br/>Above all, this is a romance, for much of its duration (meet cute and initial courtship) a rom-com even, and a highly effective example of the form at that. The only difference being that the love and laughs, of which there are plenty (most of them intentional), are embellished with extended sex scenes of an increasingly BDSM slant. Members of said BDSM community have, of course, already spoken up that both novel and film completely misrepresent their erotic enclosure. Like so many, they are missing the point. The whips and handcuffs are part of Christian Grey's personal obsession which is at the center of what essentially amounts to an updated Gothic romance. I really like the fairytale flourishes added to the material, from Bluebeard (the secrets of the Red Room) to Beauty and the Beast (Christian allowing Anastasia to visit her mother in Georgia even though he can barely stand being without her at this point), elements that further enrich the tapestry woven by Misses James, Marcel and (drum roll) director Sam Taylor-Johnson. For the latter, this is the definitive rise from the ranks of relative anonymity after an intriguing contribution to 2006's porn anthology DESTRICTED showed she could handle screen sex and the early John Lennon biopic NOWHERE BOY proved she was capable of coping with actors. Needless to say, both abilities serve her exceedingly well on FIFTY SHADES.<br/><br/>The beautiful daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, and resembling both, Dakota Johnson is sure to become a household name after her turn as audience identification character Anastasia Steele, combining gauche inexperience (innocence rather than naivet√©) with out of left field sophistication as she gets the 27-year old billionaire to do her bidding. This fantasy figure was always gonna be tough to cast but Irish-born Jamie Dornan (former Calvin Klein model, so that gets potential body issues out of the way, but especially memorable playing the psycho on TV's THE FALL) surpasses all preconceived notions and expectations by bringing a human dimension to what was very much in danger of ending up as a walking clich√©. It also doesn't hurt that both actors strike sexual sparks off one another for the heavy breathing final act. Taylor-Johnson elegantly captures every nuance of the characters dancing around each other, sniffing each other out, building genuine eroticism through a succession of scenes, even (especially, in fact) when everyone's fully dressed. She only drops the ball once, switching to decorous slow motion when Christian wields the whip, literally softening the blows, an understandable if ill-advised tactic to render S&M more palatable stretching all the way back to Just Jaeckin's STORY OF O. The cliffhanger ending has me chomping at the bit for the surefire second installment. Honestly !"

","I've just read lots of negative reviews. Let me say IT IS MY HONEST OPINION. Start with that fact that a half of people haven't ever read this book. OK, they go to watch the film and then start to criticize it. Maybe it wasn't so marvelous as everyone expected but it also wasn't so bad as someone say. There is one big drawback: you cannot understand anything without reading a book. Maybe that's why there are so many negative comments. Most of us see only sex in this film. Try to see more, than body. Try to see the soul of Christian. His love, his feelings. There is nothing banned in the film. They are adults and they can do whatever they want. Anastasia isn't a small girl, she is a woman and it is normal for her. I can give ""ten"" to this film, because I've read the book and understood what it was about. If you haven't read the book, you can see some immoral aspects. Maybe it is not for ten but NOT FOR ZERO, OF COURSE"

","I'm assuming a lot of you rating this title have not even read the book so yes going to see the movie BASED off a book without even reading the book was probably not the smartest idea you had. Without reading the book you have no idea what to expect, you think it is a love story but no it is about a tormented man with deeper issues than having to control everything. For those saying Jamie's performance was bland: he doesn't really have a personality in the book at all. He's very serious, and hardly jokes around so his performance based on what others are saying sounds spot on. With the sex scenes being watered down.. What do you expect? To even get this to the theaters and not sent to the porn industry it has to be watered down. To those saying the pair has no chemistry: they hardly have chemistry throughout the novel as well for Ana is still having a hard time accepting the fact the man she loves only wants her for one thing. I have not seen the movie yet but I loved the novels and any book to screen adaption I have seen that is more than 120 mins long ends up being almost identical to the book because it shows they took their time with production and wanted to make it as detailed as possible. I am simply rating this a 10/10 out of protest for all of those judgemental people out there trying to discourage the fans."

","Let me just say, I have read maybe half the first book, and so have not read all the trilogy. Firstly, I watched this because my wife wanted to go and not because i believed it would be a great movie, as i felt the story and the author is possibly the worst i have ever read, worst story, and writing is well just terrible. So i had little hopes for the movie, and well it didn't disappoint. Acting...woeful. Dakota really? Terrible acting, really really terrible script, but i suppose the script is no worse than the actual book. All i can say is this...if the book was written by a man, it would never have been published, let alone successful. Why women get off on the story of a wealthy successful man using his wealth and power to coerce a young innocent woman to become his slave, using her merely as a sex object just amazes me. I'm a man, and this story puts women's liberation back fifty years. Why women find it alluring that a man uses a woman as a sex object i just cannot imagine. And to make it all worse, the script and the writing quality of both the book and script is so poor, so amateurish it is actually quite embarrassing. Com on women of the world, how can you find this story anything but sexist and all those other clich√©s that women have been fighting against forever. Come on girls, WAKE UP!"

","This movie is sick, sick, sick, sick. It's labeled as a romance but there is nothing romantic about it. Soon after they start dating Christian expresses an interest in exploring a subculture relationship with Ana involving controlled bondage. During a dinner at his parents' house Ana reveals she will be leaving the next day to visit her mother in Georgia. This infuriates Christian as Ana reveals she wants a relationship that is more romantic than sexual. When the guy is more interested in sex then anything else that is not romantic and when Ana leaves Christian surprises her while she is drinking with her mother which I find kind of creepy. The is a little bit better then the book but it's still sick. Rather then waste your money rent something that actually is romantic like the Notebook or better yet get it from the library and give the money you would have used for this movie to an origination that helps abused women."

"bryanbotha777","2","6","11","24 February 2015"," Wow, this movie is bad
","So I watched this movie last night, and I felt the need to sign up to write a review, I have seen many movies so far in my short time on this earth, but let me just say, that this has to be in the ""bottom 10 movies of all time"" list. <br/><br/>I had a fair idea what the movie was about, my wife really enjoyed the books and I went in with an open mind. The beginning of the movie is so rushed, so much happens in such a short time, and the relationship is catapulted from infancy to a much deeper relationship in a ridiculously short and very forced space of time.<br/><br/>What I find even harder to comes to terms with are the characters, you are never made to feel any sort of connection with them, and they are hard to relate to. perhaps woman find themselves connected emotionally to Anastasia because of the whole ""average girl, average life, which takes a twist"" fantasy. But as a Man, I cant relate to a Wealthy, Conflicted, Dark entrepreneur with a BDSM fetish. But in the same breath, Grey is the only character in the movie with depth, and the only character anyone is really interested in.<br/><br/>I am sorry to say but Anastasia is boring, no one really cares about her, I don't think? and if you do, why do you? she is average, with a normal boring life, she lacks substance, I don't want to get to know her, why would I?<br/><br/>Overall the movie warms up, very, very slightly around half way through but soon takes is right back to the rather silly sexual relationship that, again, at risk of sounded like a stuck record, lacks substance.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is very hollow. The acting was questionable and the actors had no chemistry, and seemed to force a connection every time required."

It took about an hour and a half just to get into their real relationship and the sex..

","Although it seemed like something was missing (don't know exactly), I really enjoyed the movie and I think it was well written and directed and definitely made Anastasia more funny and strong than she is in the books. I think Dakota did an excellent job! Jamie on the other side was good too but, I must say, it gave me a slightly different impression from what I saw in the trailers. But overall, I think they did a great job and their chemistry on set was really good. I favored Ana in the books anyway so I guess that's the reason why I thought Dakota did a far better job than Jamie.<br/><br/>P.S. For those of you who think of this as an abuse, rape, violence etc., your sexual life must be really boring. But you do enjoy horror movies, where people are slaughtered or other genres where violence is indeed promoted. Something must not be right with you I say..."
"johnaston86","2","8","16","16 February 2015"," Poor
","Let me start by saying that I've never read the books, my girlfriend has and I haven't seen her so excited to see a movie for a long time, so I went along with her to see it with an open mind.<br/><br/>Put simply, it's a poor film. Poorly written with some really poor acting. The two lead characters are wooden with no real chemistry, I'd guess they were working within the confines of a pretty poor script so I'll let them and the director off a little, but this was still reminiscent of a low- budget B movie. <br/><br/>It's beyond my understanding what people can see in this movie, maybe the book was better, maybe not, I'll never know... Unless all the women I know secretly want to be tied up and flogged I don't get the attraction or the point of the film.<br/><br/>My guess is that even the people who are genuinely into BDSM are going to think this film is a terrible reflection of their way of life, the feminists will be jumping all over it (Although, in my opinion, there's nothing in it that's degrading to women. To each his/her own, if 2 consenting adults want to experiment, what right does anyone have to judge them?), the poor blokes who got dragged along to see it are going to slate it (me...) but the hundreds of thousands of fan-girls/women will still flock to see it in droves and ensure that the film makes a ton of money, the sequels get made and Valentines day gets ruined for another couple of years.<br/><br/>Having said all that, my girlfriend enjoyed it, so each to their own I guess.<br/><br/>For me the only reason it gets 2 stars is for the soundtrack, which was excellent."
"waydon-240-10112","3","8","16","15 February 2015"," Sooooo disappointed
","Well one of the most anticipated movies for years, waited ages for it to become reality and unfortunately what a let down. The actors had no chemistry at all, Jamie Dornan was certainly no Christian Grey in looks, attitude or charisma. Dakota Johnson, was to be honest a surprisingly good Ana, just a shame the chemistry wasn't there with the lead. The film it's self felt disjointed, and lost in places. I hoped they would stick to the book as close as possible but again unfortunately not. The reason Stephenie Meyer and J K Rowling books to films were so successful was they kept close to the original, knowing that's what the fans had brought into. Kate just disappeared, Jose, never got a chance to apologies, no job interviews or new job for Ana, and where was Ethan?. The whole film revolved around the two leads when they were together, which would have been great had the leads had any chemistry or they stuck closer to the original story line. The soundtrack was most defiantly the best part of this movie, I will be purchasing this but not the DVD of this movie, I shall stick to the original books."
"theoriginal_M-E","3","8","16","14 February 2015"," Fifty Shades of Grey
","Fifty Shades of Grey, the story that stole the attention of many readers. You read the book and obsess over how great and hot it is, so to hear a movie is released, hell yeah! Well, unfortunately, the movie is a big disappointment to all the book readers. <br/><br/>To start it off, you can basically tell that the characters weren't fit for the role. In the novel, Anastasia and Kat are meant to be young, but look a bit older than described in film. Christian Grey is described as a dominant and Anastasia innocent looking and clumsy. However, in this film, it seemed as neither actor were particularly engaged in their supposed character. Dornan did not look like a dominant in the film as he wasn't engaged in his character. You know, clench your jaw, growl, be aggressive. However, he sports a baby face naturally and his actions seemed awkward and scripted, it did not convince the viewers in any way whatsoever. Johnson spoke as if she was reciting her script lines, with her actions planned and unnatural, as if she wasn't acting on instinct. Like her pencil scenes, she looks like she suddenly remembers 'Oh bite the pencil!' and it just carries on through the whole film like so. There is also a scene in the film where Grey takes Anastasia for a walk and opens up about Mrs Robinson. He didn't really radiate any feelings and it felt like he wasn't engaging himself with the character. When the two characters are together, you do not feel the chemistry between them. Both act as if they are awkward with each other and although it was widely rumoured that the Johnson and Dornan actively disliked each other off set, they should be able to put that behind them when on set and do their jobs to the best of their ability. <br/><br/>The movie also skips crucial scenes from the book that actually makes up both characters and would help viewers understand the characters more. Although there is a mention of dildos and vibrators in the film, it is never used; therefore it doesn't truly express how dominant Grey is. Also, there is a bit in the book where he shaves for her, expressing how he owns her and dominates her. However these scenes are overlooked, affecting the storyline. <br/><br/>Speaking about the storyline, in the book the majority of the book is based on Christian Grey and his past, although in the film, it feels like the whole movie is based about sex, which is a disappointment, because it was rumoured that the author of the novel E.L James was on set and helped direct some scenes, and it still turned out this way. The camera was also bad quality, with the scenes blurry at some points, and the camera angles were making viewers not engage themselves in the film, which is also disappointing.<br/><br/>When reading the book, it reaches out to the readers and they engage themselves with the book, but in the movie, it seems like a comedy with their dry humour and their awkward scenes, causing laughter at unintentionally funny scenes. It's pretty obvious that this novel had a huge impact of their readers, causing people to obsess over this book, so you would think the director would at least take their opinions into consideration for characters and the movie, but it seemed as if the director ignored fans requests and were rushed to get this movie completed and released, despite being satisfied with the outcome or not.<br/><br/>The only positive thing to say that highlighted the aspect of the film was the soundtracks that were played throughout the movie; it at least made the film more appealing and sexy."

","Fifty Shades of Gray is based on a book. Neither the book or the movie has in my eyes big poetic / cinematographic value. It sounds bad, but despite that i actually enjoyed the movie very much, and the book as well.<br/><br/>As far as book goes, it is something about it, i don't know what exactly and i cant put my finger on it, but i could not put the book down, when i was reading it. I just wanted more every time i was done with one chapter. Im aware that the authors writing is very poor and far from professional, but for some reason i didn't mind it at all. <br/><br/>And with the movie it is similar. There are a lot of great things about it. For example i really like the soundtrack, i think it sets the mood perfectly. Also the work of director and cameraman is very impressive in my opinion. The choosing of the actors don't bother me at all. I think Jamie Dornan is perfect for the role, I wasn't very sure about Dakota Johnson as Anastasia at first, but she fits the role perfectly too. Her performance was very impressive and believable, I admire her for what she has done. She also brought very cute wit to the character. I also liked the work of costume designers and the transition they had made in Ana's wardrobe during the movie (i noticed that her clothes were different and more settle when she was a virgin oppose to the one she wore after, which were more feminine). The only thing I'm considering is very bad is the script. I think the writer did very poor job. I also wish that the movie would not move so quickly, i mean the scenes were one after another with fast momentum and the dialogs wasn't continuous enough because of that. But i understand that to slow down the movie momentum is quite a task, because to put 500 pages in 2 hour movie is difficult. Also, for someone who did not read the book it could be quite hard to understand Christians reason for his lifestyle, because most of it is explained in the second book. <br/><br/>I think most of people expected from it too much, thats the reason why they don't like it and they are disappointed. But i really loved it. Maybe because I'm not very demanding viewer. <br/><br/>Overall, its not movie which will won an Oscar in the future, but its enjoyable and very consuming, you will be drawn to it very quickly. I also hope they will make sequel very soon, but use another writer for the script please. <br/><br/>(I'm sorry for poor English, or if i wrote something that doesn't make any sense in grammar way,I'm foreign)"
"throughwolfseyes97","10","15","35","15 February 2015"," the movie was well-balanced, there was well-balanced intercourse and romance, funny segments¬Ö Perfectly good drama/romance movie. So I give it 10/10
","Oh, stop messing around!<br/><br/>First of all, I don't know why everyone is confusing this first part of the movie for a love story, when, in fact is pure chemistry between two people. Nowhere in the first book or the movie, the author shows growing love between the characters, instead there are signs of sexual seduction. In the book, there was intercourse on every second page and if the movie was made with that much intercourse, it would surely be porn and when the announcement was made, that there would be a Fifty Shades of Grey movie, no one said it would be that kind of movie.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there are two kinds of people, the ones who enjoy the regular intercourse and the ones who are more for the kinky staff. So I have to say that people who thought that this would be porn, would be disappointed by the lack of kinky staff in the movie and the other types would be disgusted by that way of living. I don't get why people don't get the bigger picture here, that this man has been sexually abused since he has been a child. So, naturally this is the only way of living he knows. So the point of this trilogy is his emotional healing. I must say I'm not very good at noticing chemistry between two characters, but I personally think that both of them were suitable for their roles. Many people think that Dakota was bad at her acting, but I will give them one advice: re-read the book again and notice how she is reserved, shy and distrustful of herself. When I saw the movie and saw how she was acting, I realized that she could not have gotten the role any better than that. As for Dornan, I know that every woman has her own sort of envisioning 'GREY' and it's normal to be disappointed, but it does not give them the right to talk bad about him, because he did his part excellent. In the end, the movie was well-balanced, there was well-balanced intercourse and romance, funny segments¬Ö Perfectly good drama/romance movie. So I give it 10/10 P.S. I noticed mainly the comments are written by guys, so I suppose there are a bit jealous of CG's world, so I suggest to stick to action movies."

Many people say, that they gave it a low rating because there was not enough chemistry, romance and the actors are not what they ""imagined to be"".<br/><br/>The actors you guys wanted to play Christian and Ana have refused the roles because they didn't want to be fully naked and have sex on scene, and this should be respected.I mean if randomly someone knocked on your door and said "" we want you to be fully exposed in our film"", would you accept the offer? Highly doubt that<br/><br/>And yes, many parts were missing and dodgy in the film, such as when Ana was sleeping, and Christian sat on her bed and told ""her"" about his past. Or the oral sex in the bathtub. Well, that would've been too much for Dakota.<br/><br/>Overall, I am happy with the film because the actors looked a lot like the ones I imagined to play Ana and Grey.

They hit the nail right on the head with how I imagined Grey's house, closet, and clothes would be. I felt that both actors (Dornan & Johnson) did an excellent job. Johnson is perfect & toward the end after the ""Show me how bad it can get"" scene, I felt myself almost get teary eyed because you could just feel the emotions. She sold it well! Dornan REALLY grows on you as Grey and his body was on point! Their chemistry, I thought, was great. Lastly, I'd like to add that some of these reviews are so harsh...it's a movie people! Lighten up!

We all have fantasies, remember she does what she wants in the room of pleasure so those who claim ""abuse"", she is of legal age,giving consent and actually going back to him. It's not just a ""porn movie"" there's more to it than that."
"rmaldonado2","10","13","30","16 February 2015"," Excellent!!
","I absolutely loved the movie. The movie elevates the book in a very classy and elegant way. The casting was absolutely perfect. Dakota was sassy, spunky and beautiful. Jamie was/is the perfect Christian Grey. In book 1 Christian is detached, cold and distant. He has never loved or been loved before. His attraction towards Ana confuses him and makes him unsettled. Jamie Perfectly captured the essence of Christian in book 1. Can't wait for the next movie where Christian realizes he loves Ana. I'm sure we will see a different dynamic between Ana and Christian... And we will see Jamie absolutely steal the spotlight!!!. I was a bit surprised at the react of some folks with the ending. If you read the book the movie ends exactly as the book (Ana leaves Christian). The driving back to the apt by Taylor and the crying would have been a bit too much. The movie had a perfect ending."

","THIS MOVIE WAS JUST OVERRATED and ruined the books. can't believe how i wasted 124 minutes of my life the actors were so unprofessional ..too much tension and awkwardness between ""Christian"" and ""Anastasia"" ,they didn't even had chemistry Dakota doesn't fit the role and Jamie tried..but you can see he is married because i couldn't feel any emotions between them. The movie didn't followed the books and they skipped lots of essential things. In the movie.. the action happened too fast.. one second Christian was visiting Ana at work and the next second they went for coffee? <br/><br/>it was just too funny and i just felt awkward for them they shouldn't do a 2nd or 3rd part for their seek poor movie"
"termeh_k","1","9","19","17 February 2015"," Worst Movie ever!
","I just can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this crap. The movie is more like a cheap porn than a real movie. Poor acting as well. Plain as day and THE worst actors.Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, The sex is about as sensual as a log of wood thrown on the road. One must ask, how is it possible that a movie company would bother to advertise such a disgusting movie.Normal, intelligent grown up person won't go to watch it.I'm seriously shocked how anybody is able even to like such book or movie. The movie was only marketing and it was a waste of time. There is no chemistry between characters. It is full of ""cliche"" (the piano, the red car, the computer, the helicopter and more ....) I wish I could give this a rating of 0."
"kikay10000","7","9","19","15 February 2015"," It's very INTENSE but definitely FABULOUS!
","The film adaptation of E.L. James' best selling novel is a story about a college student Anastasia Steele being blown into the world of Seattle's billionaire Christian Grey. A world that is so beyond her innocent mind. Also, it has turned into a life changing experience for her especially after meeting him for an interview.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, I just knew that the movie is really going to be ""Intense"" and ""Awkward"". But in the end, I did not prepared myself to be so shocked by it; even though that I've read the book for like thrice already! Its beautifully made, and I salute the film's director Sam Taylor-Johnson for giving light into the story without making it too hard for its viewers. Giving its viewers a chance to really focused into the love story itself, and not the sex part. Though it cannot be avoided, but still, she made it in a sensual kind of way. And if you've read the book, it is quite obvious that it was much more detailed and shocking than the film adaptation.<br/><br/>For someone who've read it, I really like the idea that the flow of the story in every scene in the film was just the way it was described in the novel. Even if there were some scenes that were cut, and altered just so that it could fit into the time frame of 125 minutes of running time. And as I keep on saying, it's a movie. What you see is what you get. But if you've read the book first, then watch the film adaptation. It's when that you'll understand each character, and the story itself; their feelings, emotions, and what really goes into their minds. Then again, the flow of the story will never be put into detail in the film. A visual story that will just go along the actors acting.<br/><br/>As for the two main characters, Dakota Johnson really did blew me away. For she is definitely Anastasia Steele; she really is that awkward, innocent, clumsy, and smart girl in the novel. I mean, I just love the way she presents herself as a simple girl. Plus, her lines and actions just makes everything more hilarious. And then there's Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey. Now that is something that I would really like to write about. Honestly, I just can't find his whole persona as the character itself. Although there are times that he is Christian Grey, and then in some scenes, he is not! But I can see why they have chosen him is the lead actor. Jamie Dornan has this mysterious and unpredictable personality which is very important in the story. For it's not about Christian Grey being way too handsome. He should be portrayed by an actor who can really go deeper into the painful and darker world of Christian Grey. And that's where Jamie has fit the bill.<br/><br/>Then there's the supporting casts. Every actor and actress in the movie really did well in portraying their roles. Especially for Eloise Mumford. For she really did well in acting out Kate Kavanagh. But I just don't get it why Rita Ora is Mia Grey! I mean seriously? She doesn't look anything like her! I just don't know what these producers were thinking when she passed the audition. Also, it was kinda sad that there were four characters that were not included in the movie. Hopefully they will be included in the sequel.<br/><br/>For those of you who didn't know, there were about 14 songs (including the instrumentals) that were mentioned in the book. But only 6 of these made it into the film adaptation. As for ""Crazy in Love"" and ""I've put a spell on you"", these songs were mentioned in the book two.<br/><br/>Lastly, I would like to point out. That if I were someone who haven't read the book at all. Only knowing about the plot story itself. I don't think that I would have enjoyed the film. For it's way too straight to the point. The important details that should have been there were left out. Only those who've really read it will know what I'm really talking about. Moreover, my main focused when I was watching the film was to get into the visual love story of Christian and Ana. And not the sex scenes. So if that's what the other viewers were really rooting for. Then they are missing the whole point. I'm just glad the they did not include that very disturbing ""Tampon Scene"". For it would have been insanely disgusting. All in all it was fabulous. And I' am definitely looking forward to the film adaptations of ""Fifty Shades Darker"" and ""Fifty Shades Freed"". Laters Baby!"
"adikedar","8","9","19","15 February 2015"," To all you women out there - give it a try.. At the end of the day, there is a unique love story!
","I absolutely loved it!<br/><br/>To all the haters - you clearly didn't understand the movie, nor read the novel. You can't see the Bold and the Beautiful and compare it with Breaking Bad. Two completely different shows with different story lines. Similarly, you can't go and see 50 Shades and expect Dallas Buyers Club!<br/><br/>I have personally read all three novels, and whilst they may have been poorly written, there was a unique love story underneath it all. It was amazing to read how she managed to change his perspective on life, and all that he's known, and likewise it was quite a transformation for her. More so, it was heartbreaking to see in the film that sometimes love just isn't enough. You can meet your soul mate, but unless they come with baggage you are willing to carry with you, it won't necessary work. <br/><br/>Now with that in mind - I thought the movie paid tribute to the book, and the (exceptionally) limited sex-scenes were tastefully done. His red room was exactly as one would picture in the novel! She played an amazing Anastasia, whereas he could have been replaced by a better choice. Given that isn't a possibility though, Christian is a 28 year old man at the end of the day and Jamie Dornan did a good job. He's dark, and in constant pain, and that showed through his character. I thought some important scenes from the novel were missing, but all in all, it was great."
"MattBrady099","2","9","19","15 February 2015"," Atrociously bad
","Fifty Shades of Grey more like Fifty Shades of Abuse.<br/><br/>The story is about a literature student, interviews the wealthy, intimidating Christian Grey and instantly develops an attraction to the enigmatic man. Grey is likewise drawn to Ana - but will only agree to a relationship on his own terms. Both will discover a place where want and desire intersect.<br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey was a movie that I had zone interested in, because I was in that bad mood where if I see a best selling novel being made into a movie which is a clich√© now, and now there did it with Fifty Shades of Grey which by the way the book sucked ass, yeah I red the book and I had no idea why it was a best seller it's basically porn on paper. What's more annoying is in the UK there are people on the Radio and everyone I met who was looking forward to this movie and my Question is why. The people on the Radio keep making top stories about it making it the hot headline and I'm here thinking ""That's really new worthy. There's loads of usual but amazing things happening around the world and this peace of sh't makes the headline. My hope for humility is slowly fading away"". And that's not all, I'm not kidding you here but there actually made a headline of it's reviews it's getting and this never happened before when it comes to movies. So after seeing Fifty Shades of Grey I can say it's not as bad as people say, it's actually a lot worse then I thought.<br/><br/>Now let me give you the positive things in this movie: Dakota Johnson was the only good actress in this movie, she did what she can do with a god awful script that she had and shes the only one in this movie that gives it her all. The movie is shot really good as well, it fitted the movie very well, but beside's that all those good things can't hind the fact that this is a abomination against humanity, it brings shame to cinema and it should be burn in hell.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about Mr. Grey The Psychopath, now I got to ask you this what do women see in this guy, I mean his not charming at all, his cold, he's kind of a ass-hole and what he want's to do is hurt you with sex, and the actor himself isn't really that good at all. And she doesn't enjoy it she only does it to make him feel good so in the sex scenes she's not enjoying it, she's getting hurt by this guy and after a while she get's crossed with him and then she runs off then start's to have thoughts about him and how she needs a man in her life so she goes back.<br/><br/>The writing in this movie I don't know if it's for comic relief or to be taken seriously, because the writing in this movie was absolutely atrocious and it's the most cheesiest dialogue ever put to film, it's Twilight dialogue bad.<br/><br/>Now is this worse than Twilight and I can't believe I'm saying this but yes it is. I found a movie that's more awful and more laughable than Twilight. I hated this movie, I hated it, I hated it, I hated it. This is the worst movie of 2015, I can't wait to forget this film. You better off seeing Kingsman: The Secret Service, I haven't see it myself yet but at least that movie looks well made and effort went into it."

Yes, the books were badly written, yes, the movie was not amazing, but it was exactly as I was expecting.<br/><br/>The script could never have been great as the story line is weak but it was funny in places and followed the books perfectly. Jamie Doran was new to me as I had never watched 'The Fall' but I give him full marks for what he had to work with and made a perfect Christian Grey.<br/><br/>As for all the reviews slamming the movie as De-grading to women and rape... did you actually watch this film? It was about 2 consenting adults exploring 2 different relationship worlds.<br/><br/>I may get criticized for my reviews but I standby how I feel, a light hearted, easy to watch film, by far not the worst I have seen, and not the best. I will certainly be hoping for a sequel in 2016."
"Hamdi-127","5","9","19","15 February 2015"," It was exactly like the book - It was good
","I actually don't understand why everyone here were so displeased with the film, it was exactly like the book and if you didn't enjoy that, then why did you go see it? I know this will seem funny to you but as a Muslim I just red the book simply to see what all the commotion was about so I just skipped all the sex scenes because that just disgusts me and in the movie I just closed my eyes every time they had sex. I admit it's weird falling in love with such a perverted maniac but he did have some really good qualities, I mean he was always honest with her, he took her on that glider (and I actually loved that scene), he visited her in Georgia. Not to mention that he is ridiculously hot! But his acting were 1 of the few things that were not so good! Every single time he said ""laters baby"" in the book I thought of it as cute and casual but it was just awkward and laughable in the movie. I really liked her acting though, she was exactly like I pictured Ana, funny and doesn't look weird when she bites her lip. The scenery was splendid, I have to give that 10/10 and the soundtrack was flawless ( I loved the helicopter scene with ""Love me like you do - Ellie Goulding"". Rita Ora and the guy playing Elliot were there for like 2 second so I'm not even gonna review that. So overall I liked the script (kinda funny, respecting the book, and ending exactly like the book but was more like a cliffhanger), most of the acting was good (when he crawled on the the bed without a shirt and ate some of her sandwich and when he was in her room right before they started having sex was kinda good, so he wasn't all bad). The plot was good but in the book she did sign the contact so I don't get why they changed that. So in general I liked it."
"screene","2","9","19","14 February 2015"," don't waste your money on this film
","Well first of all I have to say - I've read the books. And I never really understood the hysteria about ""how bad it is, and how desperate someone should be to read it""... I wondered how someone could read 100 of pages that he/she doesn't like at all?!Just to be ctitical? for me it was in fact an art of easy going novel, a simple story, which makes me wind down. It was not at all a ""piece of excellent literature"". But as I remember the author never said such things either... However I liked the atmosphere, the way it was represented. Of course there are a lot of passages I've just skipped, but all in all it was a relaxing book. Therefore I was quite curious about the film... and I was highly disappointed. At not a moment I was caught by the action. The actors didn't managed to reproduce the tingly atmosphere. Especially Christian Grey is an absolute miscast, Jamie Dorman never ever has this necessary charisma and attitude. Dakota Johnson makes it better, for her and the soundtrack the second star. In conclusion - if there comes a movie sequel I will stay away."
"karolina_aina","2","9","19","14 February 2015"," So How Grey are you?...
","The only thing in life that is non-refundable is time. So please do not spend 2 hours of your life on this movie. This is my first review. I thought about writing this review 30 minutes into the movie. I have decided to see it on the Valentine's Day surrounded by couples who expected to see intense, sexy scenes which would probably ""warm them up"" before a romantic night. I have not read the book, but I saw multiple girls reading it on the tube, so I though it must be good right? <br/><br/>After the movie ended people in the cinema were looking at each other and you can hear them asking ""That's it???."" Yep, that's it. I have watched many erotic movies that have much better plot. It is not a cinema movie, it is a poorly written television film with a big budget. The acting was quite good and I do feel sorry for the actors, because they had to play somehow with very poorly written script. The movie is just senseless and does not deliver what it was supposed to deliver! The sex scenes were supposed to have a shock factor, engage us and make us reflect on our sexuality. But sorry, handcuffs or spanking is nothing new or shocking in today's sex culture. I bet half of the people sitting with me in the audience enjoy much more intense sex life. This movie was as if it was targeting teenagers ( if I was 16 I would have probably enjoyed it), the paradox is that at 16 you probably would not be allowed to see it. The movie tried to show that some women like their men being dominating during sex but why to waste 2 hours of someone's life to state the obvious..."
"carrbm","8","9","19","13 February 2015"," I liked it - Contains Spoilers
","There are a lot of haters and negative reviews about this movie, but I really liked it. I think the actors did really well portraying the struggle between Grey's extreme dominance and Ana's need for more. I know the difference between rape and blind exception and Ana was neither of those. She was never forced and anytime she said no or stop he did. Even at the end when he did not want her to leave him. He knew he went too far, but then she had to know her limits to understand his. She hated what he did, but she also knew she asked for it. All she had to do was use the safe word and he would have stopped, but she didn't.<br/><br/>Now most of us think in the real world, if a good girl like her got into something like this she could use the safe words all she wants and the man probably would not stop. He would probably do a lot worse than just spank her six times. That is why this fictional story is about more than sex. That is what drew me in anyway. My opinion only of course. I mainly wanted to write at least one positive review of a movie I liked very much!"
"jilliancaldwell","8","9","19","13 February 2015"," Follows the Book pretty closely
","I enjoyed the movie myself. Seattle was beautiful and the characters were beautifully portrayed by great actors. I loved Dakota Johnson as Ana. She gave the character a confidence boost she didn't have in the books and some very surprising comedic relief. Dornan did a good job as Christian and made me believe his characters reaction to Ana. It followed the book pretty closely and I would gladly see it again. I don't understand why everyone is hating so much on this film. If you'd read the books you'd understand the relationship a bit more between Ana ans Christian. I liked how Ana made the decision herself to enter the relationship between her and Christian. I also found it interesting how it ended, and I was happy with how it happened."
"kiragurry","10","14","33","16 February 2015"," A Compelling Love Story That Most Are Too Naive to Appreciate
","I can guarantee that half of the people who are giving this film bad reviews have not even read the book. As with any film based off a book, the book is always better. Fifty Shades of Grey is an excellent novel about a love story between two people; an innocent girl whom has never fallen for anyone in her entire life and a man who had a devastating upbringing. Those of you who are calling this ""rape"" and turning your nose up against it because it's not something that our society is generally open to are pathetic. Anyone who reads the book can tell that there is no way in hell that this would ever be considered rape. The descriptions that E.L. James uses in the novel make it very clear that there is a deep and enchanting love between Anastasia and Christian, something that cannot be described in words. The character that is Christian Grey lives the lifestyle that he does (a lifestyle that practically comes to a halt once he meets Anastasia) due to a traumatic experience as a young child and the fact that an older woman exposed him to it at the mere age of 15. So before you go slamming the entire storyline, the author, the director, and the film with your words- get your facts straight. Anastasia was not once raped by Christian and there is a lot more to the story than seen in the movie. The novel is one of the best that I have ever read and although the novel is better, the movie is excellent as well. The cast and crew put a ton of time and effort into this production and they should be rewarded for it. It takes a lot to star in this kind of movie and I think that Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson put on a very commendable and compelling performance."

","I have read the books even though i had my reservations in reading such a book. It was a shock in my system nevertheless i took it like a normal book. Obviously if you compare notebook and this you will see lot of differences in the definition of the terms love and romance. Anyway going to the movie. When the casting was introduced I was not too thrilled but decided to give it a chance to prove otherwise. Jamie was sensational in the fall just as he was in this movie. Dakota proved me wrong as well. The movie is not a just a romantic movie but has dark thoughts and emotions. Dominant vs submissive. I didn't understand why people gave negative reviews. People talk about the abusive relationship of the characters but yet forget other movies which have more violence in them yet i don't see people going to the streets and demonstrate against it. I actually loved the movie more than the book. My main criticism was that there were scenes which could have been added to show more tension between the characters. Christian should have been more dominant - in some areas it lacked power and felt as if power were shifted. Other than that i felt that it was a very good movie. So please hurry up for the next ones:-)"

Why do woman in action movies wear next to nothing and wear high healed boots while running around with a gun? It is because it is sexy and sex sells. This does not belittle a woman.

","I know that many are afraid that this film shows too much too its audience, but remember, it is only rated R. If the producers wanted to, they could have added everything from the book, and it would have definitely have been NC-17. I can only hope that the director's cut is released on blu-ray. I am also quite sure that the film has a low rating on IMDb due to its supposed ""filthy nature."" However, I assure you that this film is no worse than shows on HBO, like True Blood, or Dexter.<br/><br/>For those of you who refuse to give the film a chance, shame on you, never judge a book by its cover, or the film its made into. It is definitely no worse in context than the Twilight Saga! It is nice to see Melanie Griffith's daughter Dakota in such a provocative role, shows shes really out to make a star of herself. She is completely captivating as Ana Steele. Dornan as Grey, however, I was not enthused with, as I think they could've made a better choice there.<br/><br/>The love scenes are very tastefully done, nothing like pornographic like many are saying.

","Basing a film off a popular novel is no easy task. Fans of the series are going to constantly judge based on a picture they painted for themselves while reading. I strongly suggest leaving your emotions about the book behind, movies and books are made to stand on their own. Which is why they are only based on said literature. For myself, Fifty Shades Of Grey (the film) exceeded any expectation I may have had. I personally find the books very redundant, and repetitive. However, what captivated me most about this story and these characters is the development of these people. Also, the realization of how much love can influence another person, and the limits you test when discovering another person. The film was able to capture these moment within these characters far better and more intensely than the novel even came close to. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan completely invited me into this world they created, leaving me inspired. I believe Sam Taylor- Johnson (director) did a brilliant job with his direction of the film. It beautifully stood on it's own- apart from the first instalment of the book series. Fifty Shades tests peoples comfort zones, and brings you into a world many are not accustomed to- leaving most, curious? I felt a large range of emotions while watching this film... I felt love, I felt pain, and I felt scared. Many films, and scripts lack the dialogue and moments to creative these rooms of emotion. Moreover, I need to give a special shout out to the films soundtrack, which provided extra ambiance for the viewers. The music beautifully tied in to the dialogue and the movement- I am enthralled. Movies markers take note! Furthermore, I have a hard time enjoying a film to my maximum potential. Being a theatre graduate, and studying performing arts for 10+ years, it is hard for me to get lost into the world of film when not presented 100% authentic. Fifty Shades Of Grey did NOT disappoint. Between the lovely and ridiculously talents cast, director, producers, screenwriters, and etc. I give this movie ten stars. Amazing Job. I am left wanting more. Fifty Shades Darker, cannot come fast enough!"

","The script of the movie and the scenes they changed in the movie made Christian less awkward. I hated the cast before I saw the movie, now I can't imagine anyone else playing those parts. There was a few scenes not in the movie but then again they contain sex and they cut quite a bit of those scenes to stay in the R rating. All the main scenes were in the film, most were the exact same but a few were remade, which were 10x better than the book! The cast was amazing, Mia didn't look as weird in action verses in the still photo. Christian is more human and less distant. He actually steals a bite from Anna!! So looking forward to the second movie!!"
"Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","5","10","22","12 February 2015"," Fifty Shades of Grey Review
","My Thoughts:<br/><br/>So first off the story/plot. The first thing at least I noticed is the pacing is very slow. The main story really revolves around will Anastasia Steel (Dakota Johnson)/won't she sign the Dom/Sub contract that Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) gives her. Anyone going into this movie thinking that she is an innocent and controlled woman is sadly mistaken. Yes at the beginning of the movie Christian pretty much stalks Anastasia until she agrees to go out with him but she has a lot more control and she knows it and uses it to her advantage over Christian multiple times throughout the movie, even demanding they sit down and have a business meeting to negotiate over the contract. Yes she is innocent in the terms that she is not very sexually experienced and Christian makes mistakes by instead of being by her side and educating her in what he desires he provides her with a contract that has a lot of scary and intimidating wordage in it as well as telling her to ""Google it"" I don't know about you but if you put in the word Bondage in Google that is likely to scare anyone away.<br/><br/>Now let us explore Mr. Grey some more. This guy is a walking contradiction. We are at first given the image that this guy is a over the top controlling personality who has the ability to read a person and then get them to operate at peak performance. But it seems that Anastasia is his kryptonite. And I want to make something abundantly clear Christian Grey is up front with Anastasia Steele the whole time with what he desires hiding nothing. He goes so far as to provide her with a multi-page contract explaining everything in detail about what he expects. He doesn't force her to sign it and as previously mentioned he wants her to make changes to the contract. But he is also very confusing as he tells her that he doesn't do normal relationships, he doesn't sleep in the same bed as the girl, and a number of other things and then completely does them, which would confuse the hell out of anyone in a relationship. He also doesn't do anything to Anastasia that she didn't tell him to show her. There is one scene where he tells her that he wants to punish her but again he doesn't make a move to do so until Anastasia tells him to do his worse and let me tell you folks I have had worse punishment as a kid then what he did to her.<br/><br/>Lets talk a little bit of Anastasia Steele. As stated earlier she is not a complete innocent going into this situation with Christian. Yes she is not sexually experienced especially with the idea of a Dom/Sub experience but hell unless you are into that or have friends that are into that and open with telling about their experience not many people know that part of the sexual experience. But she is manipulative as well in this movie. She knows Christian wants her to sign that contract and be his Sub and she dangles that repeatedly over his head to try to change him. And that is another thing, Christian is very up front with her about what he wants and throughout the movie instead of taking him on at face value she goes out of her way to change him into what she desires. And I talked this over with a friend last night that it is a running storyline in Hollywood were we fall in love with someone for what they are showing us be it the dangerous bad boy or the angelic beauty and then doing everything in our power to change that person to fit what we desire to be our perfect companion and that just doesn't line up with real life. Yes people do change over time and in relationships there is a give and take but we have to accept our significant other for who they are not who we think we can change them into and that is what Anastasia is trying to do in this movie, she wants Christian to conform to her ideas of a relationship. Now I am not saying that she should conform to his either but if you both have two different philosophies on what a relationship entails you might want to think about dating someone else.<br/><br/>My review ran over the 1,000 words allowed on IMDb so if you wish to see my full review please head over to www.shepfromtamp.com<br/><br/>My Recommendation:<br/><br/>Rent it."
"cmm_baby69","10","27","73","11 February 2015"," I liked the film, I liked the books so here's my review despite the haters...
","Just watched the film and despite all reviews and commentary on how watching it perpetuates abuse and rape I have to disagree. One I read the books when they first came out and back then I didn't see Ana & Christians relationship as abuse and I still don't think that now. The movie is good I quite enjoyed it I understand that others may not feel the same way but director Sam Taylor Johnson did a wonderful job bringing the story to life as did Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan. Dakota's portrayal of Ana brought substance and sass and Jamie did a great job as Christian. I don't agree with the amount of crap being said about the film to me it is a love story as most fans of the book would agree on that being said there were a few things from the book I wish they would've included but overall I was happy with the end result and am looking forward to the other two films to be made especially since Fifty Shades Darker was always my favourite in the trilogy. So if your a fan of EL James work watch the film make your own opinions on it and if you're not then don't see it keep your comments to yourself. <br/><br/>So ill rate it a 8/10 overall and the soundtrack is amazing."

Geeze..<br/><br/>I think everyone else have already expressed how BAD this movie is. Within 2 minutes I knew it was bad. The acting is just terrible and the ending is just as lame as the beginning. People don't have to read the books to know that this is not how the story ends..... I guess that leaves room for books two and three to be made into a movie or TV series. <br/><br/>I just hope they get better actors and add a decent and not predictable storyline. It should be OK to go away from the book to make the movie better."
"iudeanvalentin","3","7","14","19 February 2015"," Mediocre movie with huge income due to bad publicity
","This movie can be described as an over-advertised movie for a ""different"" idea but with poor execution. Acting is lazy, almost forcing you to hate it. The conversations between the 2 main characters are weak, don't build a relevant plot and fail to achieve a certain level of ""aw"". This movie has earned it's box office income based on the bad publicity people gave the book. Specially about the ""R-rated"" content. Perfect example of how a mediocre movie with an exquisite plot can beat the box office. Clever release date, perfect publicity and smart trailers. This movie should be watched sitting on the couch on a rainy Saturday, not in the cinema."

","This is a story about two stereotypical paper figures. I don't believe in the characters at all, and you feel all the way through the screen that Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan feel the same. The first half of the movie is extremely slow and uninteresting. They are building up to the first sex scene, which I don't even want to see. When the sex finally happen I'm surprised to find that this is where you find the interesting parts of the movie. Their relationship becomes a little deeper when questions like ""what do you want to do to me?"", ""Do you wanna hurt me?"" and ""Why do you wanna do this to me?"" rises. I'm sad to find that this isn't what the story focuses on, but instead it insists on showing her weakness and his superiority, which really doesn't need to be underlined yet again by her tripping or him buying her expensive stuff. <br/><br/>So, if you wanna see Dakota Johnson biting her lips endlessly and Jamie Dornan trying to look intense and interesting, but instead looking bored, this is a movie for you. If not? Rewatch Nymphomaniac!"
"kaelamckay","3","7","14","16 February 2015"," Disappointing
","Let me first clear things up by saying I was hoping for this movie to be one of those so-bad-it's-good. I happened to pick up the book while at Barnes & Noble and I read a few excerpts. The writing was so unbelievably clich√©d and cheesy, I found myself laughing out loud in the store. Unfortunately, the movie was not as entertaining as the book, mainly in part because the dialogue was a bit better. Don't get me wrong, there was still plenty of hilariously corny lines that had me dying in the theater, but aside from those instances I found myself just...bored. Stuff that I didn't particularly care about happened. The tone of the movie fluctuated quite a bit to where I didn't know whether I was watching an erotic movie or a tacky romantic comedy. The sex scenes were racy, I guess, but they lacked passion, and for me, were just there. This is probably because the two lead actors had no chemistry whatsoever. I'll give credit where credit is due though; Dakota Johnson gave a pretty good performance. Another problem with this movie is that the Twilight parallels are blatant, right down to the creepy-but- supposed-to-be-charming boyfriend, the pathetic puppy dog best friend, and the awful dialogue (though this one is better acted). So, all in all, I didn't so much hate this movie as I was just bored of it and I actually fell asleep during it. Don't waste your money."

Both Dakota and Jamie did a amazing job!! For those saying the book is much better, I think that movies are never going to be exactly the same as books, I mean, if there's a movie ""exactly"" like the book, why bother having a movie version of it? Since you're much satisfied with your imagination anyways.<br/><br/>Overall, I think although the movie has omit some scenes and details, I have no trouble understanding the plot at all!!

"maggiev-77","9","7","14","15 February 2015"," It's not Porn, it's a love story
","Well for starters I think it is a shame that people have written a review based on the fact that they haven't read the book or have heard what the content is supposedly about and the preconceptions this has alluded to in their mind, especially believing it's a pornographic movie/book depicting domestic abuse towards women. There is know forcefulness, it is all CONSENSUAL. Seriously, in today's society has no one learn't to be open minded or does everyone walk around with their eyes closed shut.<br/><br/>Books are always going to be better than the movie and I think the first movie in this trilogy was surprisingly done tastefully. For anyone who has been following news bits about the movie then they would have known that no full frontal was going to occur. That's why we have imaginations people, it's not necessary to see things completely actioned out. What people also have to remember is ultimately, this is a love story. It is a trilogy for a reason and the beginning is the most important journey to the conclusion.<br/><br/>Having said all that the script wasn't all that bad although there were a couple of points that probably needed clarification, especially if you haven't read the books. What happened to Ana giving Jose a serve after trying to kiss her. If you're going to have the almost kiss you need the berating considering he has his part to play in movies 2 + 3. I think there were a couple of scenes a bit rushed, like when Christian met both her mum and dad. They were kind of blink and miss moments.<br/><br/>I think Jamie Dornan played his part perfectly and it will be great to see how he evolves over the next 2 films. I think when you looked at his eyes you could see the warring of his emotions. Dakota Johnson was really good also which I did not expect but they both had great chemistry on screen and I think the 2 leads were chosen very well in the end.<br/><br/>Edit: Went and saw the movie a second time and fell in love with it even more. I picked up on a few things that I hadn't heard or noticed before so I have changed some of my remarks.<br/><br/>To whomever the director/producer/screenwriter is, please don't be afraid to make the next 2 movies around 2.5 hours long because I think they will only get better but there are crucial moments in the next 2 books that shouldn't be rushed. I also applaud the way the sex scenes were done, hopefully that will be similar in 2 + 3 as there is nothing like imagination.<br/><br/>Look forward to Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed when they get the green light and hopefully they turn the haters it to fans."

","Fifty Shades is not a bad movie. Yes the writing of the book wasn't that great, but what I loved was the story of these two people. The movie was everything I had hoped it would be. Dakota Johnson brought humor to Ana which played out perfectly. Jamie Dornan did amazing as Christian, being how he is very guarded and secretive, so I am glad they didn't give everything away in this first movie. There is a whole lot more to learn and I can't wait for the next movie. All the music in the film was great, and some from the book was added. Of course it couldn't have everything from the book into the movie but I thought it stayed pretty true. hopefully people will see that this was not Porn, and this was and is a love story!"
"annatom23","10","32","89","9 February 2015"," Amazing!
","I absolutely adored the movie especially Dakota's acting as Ana. She portrayed the character very well and gave Anastasia a strong role. Even though she was the submissive, she was actually the one with all the power. Jamie Dornan's acting was also SUPERB. Loved every part of it and can't wait for the next two parts. Although I believe the book was not written very well, I believe the movie is simply amazing. I would recommend everyone to watch it and please don't judge the movie until you've seen it. It's actually very differently portrayed from the book. As I mentioned earlier, while the book portrayed Ana as weak and submissive, the movie shows her stronger and more bolder. P.S. I'm going to watch it again and again and AGAIN till I have memorized each and every word. ;)"

","This film rarely interested me i sat in my chair restless and counted the lights in the cinema. When i did watch i felt nothing but sheer anger. To see so many women turning into giddy school girls over a lead character who is basically promoting domestic violence. Women have come far in today's society and to see them lusting after the idea of a man who is going to control them and tell them what to do like some 1920's husband and sickening. Forgetting the storyline for a second the film itself was absolute garbage. The the characters were completely one dimensional and may as well have read on screen from the script. It was in fact not even sexually arousing which i believe it was meant to be. i have never been less excited to see boobs in a movie. Such obvious product placement was laughable worse than james bond film sponsored cola. Everything was just so unrealistic. also Christian grey is clearly a psychopath. Just do not watch this movie!"
"jdesando","Null","11","25","12 February 2015"," Even nuns would approve this lukewarm potboiler.
","""My inner goddess is dancing the merengue."" Anastasia Grey from the novel, Fifty Shades of Grey <br/><br/>You're approaching this filmed version of the wildly successful sex novel Fifty Shades of Grey in the right way if you think that quote is sophomoric, typical of a na√Øve English major stepping out into life. It is a silly statement, and the heroine of the film, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), is less na√Øve than she is a thrill seeker.<br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey is a torture of unfulfilled curiosity about S-M, for the heat is low on the chili pepper. Although Steele's exposed breasts supposedly lead to greater erotica, they rather are the limits of exposure and the wrong signs of sensuality, which should emanate anyway from words, not just flesh.<br/><br/>The purveyor of the sexual fantasy, the dominant Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), is a sadly repressed, secret misogynist, whose introduction of Ana to the pleasures of his red room (handcuffs, whips, et al.‚Äîthe usual but just more finely turned out) turns out to be an exploration of low-level power plays rather than a turn on. In fact, her role as submissive eventually turning dominant is never fully explored here, just hinted at, but enough of the hints, please: She's a power bottom; I can feel it even if I can't see it.<br/><br/>Mr. Dornan may be the problem, or perhaps director Sam Taylor-Johnson is, because the actor is a much better model than actor. At the least, he needs to have depths that can be explored, but here he seems cyber-like stoic. When he says, ""I don't do romance. My tastes are very singular. You wouldn't understand,"" the hidden promise that he is complicated and ultimately lovable never reaches the audience.<br/><br/>In other words, although it takes quite a bit of bad sex to bore me, this antiseptic delivery of pleasure is just that, or just what you would have expected from boring Bella Swann of The Twilight tortures (Anastasia being based on Bella, I am told). Bella was boring, Ana is boring, and this film is boring. Yet in the cold light of analysis, Johnson is the best part of the film, a not particularly beautiful woman, all the better for us to identify with, and a semi-naif adventuring out without a map.<br/><br/>To witness Ana panting from the first time she sees him in his perfectly tailored suit covering a perfectly sculpted body is to question immediately what kind of a Romantic she really is (or maybe I'm carrying my love for 19th-century sensibilities too far into the 21st). Again it could be the director calling for some over-the-top acting.<br/><br/>Hundreds of years ago, Geoffrey Chaucer included a story in his Canterbury tales that explained what women really want‚Äîmastery over men. Now that's telling it like it is, and I suspect this tale, which goes into three novels, will end up the same way. The film is only a disappointing beginning.<br/><br/>But getting anywhere meaningful through flabby porn is too slow and stupid, even for a broken-down Catholic boy in whom the S-M-leaning nuns instilled a life-long interest in passionate sex only to discover it's not in films that promise to bare it all but rather hidden deep in the Cinderella story.<br/><br/>Mother Mary, help us all in this dead-zone time of year, where good movies are much scarcer than good sex."

"MeMeTellem","7","5","9","28 March 2015"," An Open Mind is Required.
","Now bare with me. The acting in this movie is very melodramatic. The movie didn't give Christian and Ana enough time to get to know each other; one scene she was in his office and the next, in his bed. Movies don't need to be long and drawn out but they don't need to be speedy fast either. However, there were some scenes that were quite hot. The scene where Christian says ""if you were mine you wouldn't be able to sit down for a week"", when they had sex for the first time, and the first time he gave her a taste of what he likes with a bit of wine and ice while her hands were tied to the bed frame. This movie does undress its actors a lot but none of the sexual moments read pornographic. If you've read the books or noticed the previews then, you should know that Christian likes Bdsm. What was shown in the movie was more of kinky sex than bdsm. However, what was described in Christian's contract was definitely pornographic bdsm. It seems like most people have not discovered bondage,submission, dominance, and other sex forms like it until this movie, which explains why they are so grossed out. There are different pleasures out there other than regular old sex. Don't be so judgmental. It's kind of ironic. Anna too was disgusted when she researched Christian's liking but he told her she doesn't have to do anything she's not willing to try and some of what she tried, she ended up liking. She had to get out of her head and go into it with an open mind. There are some reviews on here that say ""is this what women like?"". Well that is up to the woman. Women like to feel needed and wanted and women like to give love and receive the same, or more of it. The way Christian chased after Anna was like he needed her and the way he so desperately wanted to have his way with her was how badly he wanted her. He too was falling for her but it interfered with the way he liked things and she just couldn't adapt one hundred percent. She wanted the same love from Christian that she was willing to give him. But, he isn't ready to fall in love with her. So far as Rape goes...How was Ana raped? She did not say no to him during their sexual acts, he asked her did she like this and that and she complimented him on his skills when they were done. She was free to stop at any given moment and leave which he reminded her of in the movie."
"kregwhitmore","1","5","9","20 March 2015"," Fifty Shades of Why
","Once upon a time, a television executive discovered the ""Twilight"" books, and became such a super-fan of the poorly written drivel that she decided to take up the hobby of writing Twilight Fan Fiction.<br/><br/>Somehow, this developed into the novel that is ""Fifty Shades of Grey"".<br/><br/>She has admitted to being aware of the fact she is not a great writer, and that the book is her ""midlife crisis, writ large. All my fantasies in there, and that's it."" Allegedly, she was as shocked as anyone that the book's popularity escalated so quickly and that suddenly she had film studios negotiating for the rights to turn her version of Twilight into a major motion picture.<br/><br/>The film adaptation is just as bad as one might expect given the facts I have presented you with. One gets the impression that both writers really don't have even a rudimentary understanding of what BDSM is, how it actually works, and that everything they know about it is based on every bad cop drama that's misrepresented or otherwise created an aura of terror around that subculture, things they've seen but didn't understand at an adult ""bookstore"", and maybe a glance at a Wiki article on the subject.<br/><br/>This resulted in the perpetuation of the ignorant perception that BDSM is synonymous with psychopathy and that it's really just domestic violence dressed in leather and carrying a whip. Needless to say, this really angered people that actually do participate in such activities - especially those that consider it a lifestyle. I myself having a working knowledge of the subject and an open mind, find it irritating and obnoxious. The film has all the eroticism of an episode of ""Saved by The Bell"" and honestly that show is more arousing.<br/><br/>Yet, inexplicably, there is a sequel in the works.<br/><br/>My advice, if you have yet to see this film is to never watch it. It's not even so bad that it's good...it's just garbage with a big budget.<br/><br/>If you went to see this because all of the media hype regarding how kinky and risqu√© it was supposed to be, and that part of it piqued your interest...and you were hoping to get at least a glimpse into that world, I highly recommend watching the documentaries ""Sick: The Life & Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist"", and ""Graphic Sexual Horror""."

","Firstly, I'm very surprised to see all these horrible reviews on the movie.

Within the first 10 minutes, I actually liked the movie and by the time it was over I was satisfied. I thought both Jamie and Dakota did an excellent job portraying Christian and Anastasia. Jamie's English accent could have been better but overall he did an amazing job. Most of my friends who read the book liked the movie also. I think some people expected way more from the movie but it's important to keep in mind that movies are always different from the books, and it's impossible to make a movie out of an entire book. There are always going to be plenty of missing elements. Also, it was Sam Taylor-Johnson's first time directing an actual movie. I think if they had got someone more experienced the movie would have been much better. For example, I felt like the producers expected us to know who Kate was. I was totally confused in the beginning and there were many times where I had to keep turning to my friend to ask her who was who and etc. However, that doesn't change the way I felt about the movie. It was well done and I will definitely be going back to watch the sequels if there are any."

"rosamartinez1","10","12","28","20 February 2015"," My brief thoughts on FSOG
","I absolutely loved the movie. Everything about it. When I first read the books I had no particular actors in mind. Once I found out that Dakota Johnson was Ana Steele and Jamie Dornan was Christian Grey I reread the series and found that I loved them as the characters. Once I saw the film I knew it was right. Jamie did great at playing Christian's cold, distant, unemotional self. And Dakota did great at bringing Ana's bold and smart yet na√Øve persona. All I know is that I can't wait for the sequels. Jamie will get to show more of Christian opening up to Ana. And Dakota will get to show how dominant she truly is over Christian."
"MrsMoreau","10","12","28","17 February 2015"," Flawless adaptation of the book
","OK - I don't normally write reviews on here but I am really tired of this movie getting slated - probably by people who hated the book - who are then in turn obviously going to hate the movie, what did they expect?! but the fact is, for the 100 million people that have read the book and loved it this film is absolutely perfect. Let's face it, it was almost guaranteed to be a success as long as they didn't change anything, they already got the casting spot on so there was no real way it was going to disappoint the fans. I went into it ignoring the bad reviews, as I ignored the bad reviews of the books - I love both the books and the movie. I found myself, within the first five minutes of the film starting saying to my friend that it was already better than I expected, Sam Taylor Johnson did an excellent job with this film, it is beautifully shot, Dakota Johnson is 100% perfect as Anastasia, it's uncanny how she is exactly how I imagined her to be when I read the book, she has the exact right balance of innocence and confidence, she was perfect, Jamie Dornan too, was the absolute perfect Christian Grey, and the chemistry between the two of them was palpable, you fell in love with them instantly. I was really impressed with how certain scenes were handled in the film, dialogue that could have easily come off as cheesy was well acted and in some parts intentionally funny - there were a few great laughs in the cinema and it was the perfect balance. I think everyone was most concerned about how the red room scenes were going to be shot, and i have to say, they could not have been done any better, it was shot beautifully, their chemistry was amazing and the soundtrack was perfect, once again exactly how I and I am sure every other person who loved the book imagined it to be. Every single set int the movie was spot on to the book, showing that so much attention to detail went in to making this movie. The contract scene was absolutely brilliant too, really funny and well handled, both actors handled the humour of the situation perfectly and it only added to the belief in their relationship. All in all, i would go as far as to say I have never seen a film adapted from a book where literally every single detail was perfect, it had the perfect balance of sex and romance just like the book, nothing was missed out that was of importance and in some parts, it was an improvement on the book, if anything the film highlighted in more detail how messed up Christian is and how strong Ana is, it was really beautiful in parts. I absolutely loved it, and all the haters who have slated this movie fall into the same pile of all the haters who slated the books, the fact is you can't argue with 100million book sales and a 250million dollar opening weekend. The fans of fifty shades will not be disappointed with this movie, it was absolutely, completely perfect and I cannot wait to see the next one, I only hope the rumours that Sam Taylor Johnson won't be directing the next ones isn't true as she did such an amazing job on this one. <br/><br/>So my review of this film is without a doubt 10 out of 10 - the attention to detail made this a flawless adaptation of the book, and the millions of fans that had so much fun reading the novel, like me and my friends, would find it impossible to find fault with this movie, the actors and director encapsulated perfectly what I am sure, every person that read the novels have been imagining for the last three years. Loved. it."
"niagass","10","12","28","17 February 2015"," Totally delivered
","I found the movie to be very entertaining and left wanting more. The adaptation from book to film was spot on. Of course there were parts in the book I would have loved to have seen make the film version,but in reality my minds eye version would have been something unwatchable. Dakota and Jamie's performances were brave and I never saw them acting not once. The theater was filled with people all ages ranges and diverse ethnic backgrounds couples groups singles. I was not surprised. The books did not sell so many copies for no reason. People loved this story. The scenes were tasteful and overall I felt the actors embodied the roles of Ana and Christian. I read all three books and know the story well."

","Whether you are a fan of the books or not it doesn't have any relevance to watching this for the first time. I am not sure of what people's expectations are of a movie from a book. While the book is not going to win any Pulitzer prizes it has been a massive seller since 2011 which is plenty of time to find the cast and write a screenplay and this movie is what you get. <br/><br/>Do the haters out there not realize that this is the first part of a trilogy ? Did you have you face and body inserted into this movie and that was what let you down ? What were you truly expecting ? This is a movie that replicates the without going across the line, it does not represent violence to woman, this movie is a modern day love affair with a kinky sexual twist. Nothing more and nothing less. <br/><br/>I suggest for all the professional women journalists out there that are canning this movie do two things: 1. Watch this movie for what it is........... Escapism and Fantasy 2. Have a look at your own vanilla sex life and try and push the boundaries you might find there us something out there you might just like and I don't mean making you Husband wear your panties as he probably already does. <br/><br/>Harden up people and enjoy this movie for what it is."
"peter-eldon","8","18","46","12 February 2015"," ""Bridget Jones enters the dark side of the Secretary""
","When the innocent English literature student Anastasia ""Ana"" Steele played by the beautiful and charming Dakota Johnson steps in for her sick room-mate Kate Kavanagh and visits The House of Grey in Seattle for the first time to interview it's 27 year old mystical billionaire owner Mr Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) the tension sparks off right from the start all the way to the end, leaving you with a great cliff-hangar. The innocent and naive Ana stands by her warm-hearted values and beliefs as the cold Christian seduces her right from the start and implements his control, while helplessly falling in love with her.<br/><br/>With a roaring temperature the moods keep swinging and rising as long as the film goes on, Presenting you with intriguing and sometimes scary insights to the secretive world of Mr. Grey and the early experiences that have shaped him into what he has become. Both Christian and Ana have concerns with their growing fondness and attraction of each other, while also loosing control over their feelings. You do ask yourself where it all will end, as well as the ever-growing feeling of who is controlling who is playing in the back of your mind.<br/><br/>You find Ana battling with her strong feelings towards Christian, as she struggles to understand and accept why she has to submit to his desires and issues. Christian who keeps letting his own grip on his detailed rules and control decline to the attraction of love, forcing him to deal with his dark side and let true love and emotions flow. One thing is for sure; money and power can't buy love!<br/><br/>Director Sam Taylor-Johnson has made an exiting and playful film with an electrifying tension and build up of E.L. James novel and is a very good portray of todays time and humanity. The way he has created these characters on screen and the kind of people they are portraying are absolutely spot-on. I believe a lot of people can say they know somebody similar to the characters of Ana and Christian. Fifty Shades of Grey also gives you the impression that everyone is a product of his or her own experiences and society. They also get it right with the casting, the editing, parts of the soundtrack and cinematography, especially while showing the more dramatised intimate scenes and the "" seductive glamour of the high-end rich city swagger life"".<br/><br/>A lot of people will be leaving the cinema with a secret crush on either or both Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan while feeling they want in on some action! With it's long waited premiere nicely screened during Valentines, Fifty Shades of Grey will most definitely be one of the hottest Valentines Day in a long time. P.s. not to mention the bondage gear sales reaching skyrocket levels around the world. I've not seen a film like this in a very long time and I am really looking forward to watch the next episode. Tip: Watch this film with your partner or date!"
"titch_goodman","10","14","34","17 February 2015"," I think it was a really good film.
","I must admit I loved this film. I think Jamie Dornan was wonderful in this. Very big part to play and I think he was brilliant. Dakota was amazing in it absolutely stood out and fit the part. I believe all the characters played their parts really well and I was very impressed. I want to go back and see it again and can't wait for the DVD to come out. Really looking forward to the next film. Don't change any of the cast as it really would take the effect away from the film.Yes some of the scenes were saucy but that's the point in this type of film I do not believe you would have got the full effect if these were not in it. I think the way it was all done was a really good job and I really did enjoy it from start to finish only wished the next film was out to so I could follow it straight after.."

","This was a fantastic movie (never read the book) but my heart was pounding the entire movie, how often do you see something truly unique hit the big screen anymore? I went with my wife and we loved it.. All you can think the entire movie is could you imagine?? Or holy wtf!?! Totally mental yet completely awesome and would recommend anyone with an open mind to go. I was not a fan of the cast before going in to see it, but I thought they pulled it off. Christian Grey was intimidating and powerful and Anastasia was innocent and quiet and the dominance was produced and such a strong way it blows you away. Definitely like a porno on TV but get over it people enjoy going to American propaganda like American sniper where they praise people killing others yet we get all uptight about some nudity and sex scenes.. get over it."
"calzadilla-238-651746","10","14","34","16 February 2015"," Most Underrated Movie at the Cinema
","First off... this movie DOES NOT degrade women. If anything it is the exact opposite. -- You find reviews that love it.. and you find reviews that hate it... makes you wonder. This movie would be a great psychological experiment of people. To me this movie is flawless and a great adaptation of the first book. In my eyes the only people that would not like this movie are people that are not very sexual or that do not understand how things can be communicated through sex... which I am sure did not like the book either. -- a lot of critics talk about Twilight... this movie is nothing like Twilight as everything in this movie can be REAL as well as the story just makes Twilight look like miserable fantasy. This movie is about a powerful guy who has a soft side for a girl... who is very innocent and has qualities he has always wanted... as the movie develops you start to understand this. The movie takes you through a change of the characters... this is what makes it a great movie. -- Gladly it ends in a way that keeps you satisfied yet lets you know there is more to tell. Some say ""soft core""... the movie has a lot of sex obviously but sex is not the point of the movie... and NO WAY is it ""soft"" when they do do it. My girlfriend and I both enjoyed the movie."

","My husband took me for Valentine's Day and after reading all 3 books I was very excited to see the characters come to life on the screen. I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying the plot and dialogue follow the book closely, and because of this some people may not understand or appreciate the movie as much. For instance, the phrase used often in the book, ""laters baby"", sounds very strange out loud leading people to say the scrip is crap or the actors were 'awkward'.<br/><br/>I've read reviews where people say the movie is 'sterile' and not steamy...that is the whole point! Christian Grey is a control freak. And to the people who think this book promotes violent or abusive relationships...please! It's a fictional series, and if you don't agree with it, don't watch it! Very entertaining, erotic and I can't wait to watch it 100 more times, not to mention see the 2 sequels!"
"janaina-bondoc","10","14","34","15 February 2015"," Surprisingly good movie despite the criticism.
","I went into the theatre with an open mind, and got positively surprised! Sure, there are a few sex scenes, but that is to be expected. It is an intriguing film with a lot of good elements. People seem to hate on this movie because it is popular, or because they haven't seen the movie itself or just expected it to be terrible. Most people seem to miss the story behind the sex scenes, and I was impressed with the movie despite it's bad reputation. People seem to judge this movie because of the sex scenes, and that's the problem. They don't see the actual story of the movie, because they're so focused on the sex scenes, and not on the deeper story below the surface. I thought this movie was very original and has a great story. This movie is for open minded people, unfortunately this world has a few of those. I recommend everyone to see this movie with an open mind."
"alwaysholiday100","10","14","34","15 February 2015"," Great movie just like I expected!!!
","Well first off, I read all 3 books twice! I LOVED the books just liked I LOVED the movie and cannot wait for Fifty Shades Darker, and Fifty Shades Freed. Fifty Shades of Grey was an excellent movie, some are claiming it was a ""porn"" when it definitely was not a ""porn"" Dakota Johnson who plays the role Anastasia Steele had parts where her breasts show, there were also parts of the movie were you see flashes of Anastasia Steele and Christian Greys (Butt) but really how can that be ruled as a ""PORN"" no its not! They had intimate parts of the movie just like I would expect from reading the books and if you read the books you would expect that as well! Second some claim it was not ""Sexy"" enough that I cannot understand either, the movie was very sexy, two people who fall in love at different terms is what I saw in the movie Fifty Shades of Grey. I am also reading comments where people are saying the two Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey did not have a ""connection"" WOW, is all I can say. I don't know what anyone expected for them to be all over each other?! That is not how the books played out at all and that is certainly not how I saw the movie! Christian Grey was very wise, very calm and knew what he wanted he was not looking for love when he met Anastasia so he didn't exactly know how to act toward the feelings that were rising. Anastasia was in college and in fact a virgin and did not know a thing about that kind of relationship. I just want to end this off with saying the movie was exactly how I thought it would be, the movie was amazing just like the books. People are downing the movie because they claim it is all these bizarre things! If you read the books or if you didn't read the books I am sure you heard people talking about them you knew what the books would be about so you knew going into seeing the movie what the movie would be about! So really no one has the say so to down this movie by calling it ""porn"" 'down grading women"" or anything because everyone knew exactly what this movie was going to be about! Great job Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan!"
"sarahellis_06","10","14","34","15 February 2015"," Well I loved it.
","I think people need to calm down....it was a good movie. The book to movie adaption was one of the best I've seen. The books were junk food books, little guilty pleasures and that's what the movies will be. I didn't get the feeling of ""rape"" once. Yes he's a control freak but everything they do she agrees to. Sometimes people just need to relax! If you don't like that sort of thing don't read the books/go to the movies. I'm all about the feminist movement but I had no problem with this movie. I didn't feel like it belittles woman or promotes violence against woman. It would be different if she didn't agree to it or said no but that's not the case sooo."
"Sarahyeah","10","14","34","15 February 2015"," Why all the negativity?
","I have no idea why the reviews are so bad, it's well acted and the story is true to the books. They have removed the awful inner goddess nonsense too which made it much better (no 20 something woman would ever speak like that!) I would have liked more from the other characters, however, they have had to condense a book into 2 hours. Hopefully, the next 2 films will expand on these characters. <br/><br/>There is a lot of controversy surrounding the subject material, but it is very apparent that their relationship is based on mutual trust, understanding and consent. The film highlights this more than the book does, so be assured that it in no way 'glamourises' domestic violence (frankly, to compare this film to victims of domestic violence only does an injustice to them and further alienates people who enjoy a BDSM lifestyle)<br/><br/>I get the impression that the media (and people who are not fans) enjoy looking down their noses at this film, and anyone who enjoyed watching it. It is not an art-house film, it does not pretend to be. It's a fantasy love story about a couple who are figuring out how to be together when they want different things from each other, which is really what most relationships are about - compromise. Although not art house, it is beautifully shot. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed reading the book you will probably like the film too. Don't worry about what the professional film critics say you should be reading or watching! They are not the target demographic so their opinion is pretty much redundant here. It may just be the case that a few bad reviews came in, it snowballed into 'mob mentality' and then everyone wanted to jump on the hate bandwagon. <br/><br/>I was glad to see a woman on screen with normal pubic hair, boobs and a healthy figure. After a while seeing stick thin women, or porn star types gets a little boring not to mention depressing. To those who have said she is plain or flat chested, this is what a normal healthy woman looks like and I feel sorry for their wives or girlfriends (if they have them) if you don't see this. it is also important to remember that this was written by a woman, directed by a woman, screenplay by a woman about a woman and female sexuality. The sex scenes in the books and film mainly focus on her satisfaction and enjoyment, not his, which is probably why it has been so successful with women world wide (men, this is important for you to understand!) <br/><br/>I didn't agree with the implied mental illness associated with a BDSM lifestyle, however, E L James has said that she didn't know much about it before she wrote the story and as she never expected this to go much further than a fan site, this can be put down to ignorance.<br/><br/>The humour in the film makes it more than just a 'sex film', its a rom com...with a dom (couldn't help it!) <br/><br/>I am only giving this film a 10/10 to make up for the abundance of unfair harsh reviews, its more like an 7 or 8/10. It does what it was intended for, provides a fantasy for 2 hours. Im confused as to what people expected from this film. Also, there are a few cheesy lines in it. <br/><br/>and finally, who doesn't like a film with a naked Jamie Dornan in it! Come on people!"
"mrsveronicagrey","10","14","34","13 February 2015"," What I loved and what could have been BETTER
","I believe as for the display it was very well shot, they chose good scenes...but of course, a lot of her internal dialogue wasn't portrayed. I did not get that sense of them falling in love. Of her being wowed by his world. It was too short in my opinion and they should have insisted more on scenes that reflect how Christian and Ana feel about each other. The ending was surprising! I wish they stayed more true to the book, linger more on the key situations and their eye contact, how frustrated they felt about each other..insisting more on the leitmotifs. Sure, the lines did appear, but they are SO IMPORTANT in the book, and the movie just seems to skip that. Felt superficial because of that. Except the ending. That is where Dakota and Jamie proved they can act very well!"
"geno-young","3","8","17","19 February 2015"," If you didn't read the book, don't see this film
","I'd like to start by saying that Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson did a fabulous job portraying Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. I have read the first book (Yes, straight guys do read erotic dramas) and I must say that their portrayals were dead on with the characters that I envisioned in my head as I was reading.<br/><br/>As far as the film goes, as much as it pains me to say this, this was a terrible adaptation which didn't do the book justice! Sam Taylor-Johnson and Kelly Marcel ought to be dragged out into the street and shot!!!! What kills me is that the film had a lot of potential with the sexy lineup of actors and top notch set designs and IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE!!!!! <br/><br/>My bone of contention with the entire film is the fact that it sort of jumped into the story with both feet in, opposed to there being any sort of build up. There is no introduction to the characters and very little plot. The opening sequences of the film is missing at least a half hours worth of detail and character intros crucial to any good film. It's as if the writer who obviously has read the book felt that since she was already knowledgeable about the extensive foreplay in the early chapters of the book, that was grounds for her to omit large portions of the story and kind of just jump to conclusions. Not taking into account that over half of the film's audience has never read one of the books, let alone all three! If I hadn't read the first book prior to seeing the movie I would have been completely dumbfounded and bewildered by the entire thing, which explains its resounding disapproval!<br/><br/>There is no reason why 15 minutes into the film, Christian has already taken Anastasia to breakfast and told her that he isn't the man for her when it seems that they have just met! There is also no reason why 25 minutes into the film they have already F *CKED each other three ways from Sunday, and we still don't have a good feel of the identities of each character.<br/><br/>The entire film has gaping holes in it, that can only be filled if you read the book and know what really happened! There are amazing sexual scenes, most notably the bathroom scene, and other great scenes that were either completely omitted or severely condensed and censored (THE BATHROOM SCENE). All in all, Great Book, Phenomenal Cast, but terrible directors and writers!<br/><br/>THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE CENTURY, I can only hope that the next two films clean up this mess that dares to bear the same name as the greatest erotic novel of all time!"
"pewshda","5","8","17","17 February 2015"," I'm a guy who had zero desire to see this movie, but I'll be honest.
","First off, I've never reviewed anything on here as far as I can recall but to give you a little insight on my tastes and the general level of quality I view, It's rare I watch anything below a solid 7 on here. I'm the typical TV-Drama kind of person who likes Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Homeland, True Detective, Game of Thrones, etc... in other words not the person who wants to watch Fifty Shades of Grey.<br/><br/>Now that we got that out of the way, I was asked to see this with my Fianc√É¬© for Valentine's Day and while I put up a fight about it for a while I realize I can sacrifice 2 hours for her on that day -- At least we had a nice Dinner beforehand.<br/><br/>I'm going out on a limb here and giving it a 5/10 though... a 1/10 seems just too predictable for a bad review and almost comes off as trolling to me. Don't get me wrong, I did NOT like this movie and have no desire to ever watch it again but I'll try and stay within the realm of honesty here.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>1. I was uncomfortable seeing this in a theater filled to a sold-out crowd of strangers, luckily we got one of those 'couples' seats which had no other seats next to us and that helped me out a bit -- I went into this knowing it would be awkward watching this content with someone I've never met on one side of me and everywhere else... Crisis averted.<br/><br/>2. The two main characters didn't really bother me like some reviewers are saying, I wasn't a big fan of them or their acting but it didn't seem much different than any other average movie and I think some people are being a hair overly critical of this. They're both attractive people as well, she's got nice eyes that's what I noticed most of the time.<br/><br/>3. I could appreciate some of the Cinematography... because I am into this stuff as a creative person myself, the shot of them reviewing 'the contract' in the office during sunset was visually pleasing to me for example... there was some decent camera work, set design and so on in that department but most any movie these days has a little.<br/><br/>4. The movie was far less ""Rapey"" than I was expecting, yeah at the very end of the movie was literally the only spot I ever felt like it really became somewhat 'abusive' throughout the entire thing it was tame and both parties seemed on board with everything going on... I think this was wildly blown out of proportion by social media and the reviews I have read. I am guessing that the 2 subsequent stories and/or movies may get worse I have never read any of them and have no desire to.<br/><br/>From an 'abuse' standpoint this is really mild and not anything the level I was expecting from comments on Facebook and the general hype based criticism following the story/film. I feel like I am defending the story or film here which is not the case I am just trying to be reasonable and honest here, there are either a TON of overly sensitive pussies out there or I'm missing something.<br/><br/>5. The Sex scenes were decent, totally soft-core but I've always thought the whole being bound thing was hot way before anyone ever thought of this book or movie. Nothing felt ""rapey"" again like I said earlier, the only abusive thing was the very end of the movie otherwise she enjoyed everything she got. I know the whole BDSM community is offended by this story/movie, whatever as well -- I don't think it's really so terrible enough to get in a tizzy about it but I think they're just more annoyed by all the 'newbies' thinking this is what it's all about.<br/><br/>6... The best thing about the movie was all the idiotic women giggling over the obvious carryovers from the book, certain lines or reactions and even some of the sex scenes had giggles coming from everywhere and uncomfortable dudes pretending to yawn... I know how that works guys, you weren't yawning you were uncomfortable.<br/><br/>I'm going to end this right here, it's the most poorly executed and written review because I haven't proof read anything and just word vomited... but hey, it's Honest.<br/><br/>I feel like I should relinquish my man-card by giving it a 5/10 and not 1/10 like all the other cool people but what the hell... I'll just go back to my quality viewing habits and everything will be just fine.<br/><br/>Fin."

","So despite the damned censorship, this movie can't be described in any other word than abysmal. From acting, actors to plot, practically anything made me want to jump out the theater after 30 minutes. What the hell were I expecting ??? This Ana is just another version of Bella (uh, familiar?) and her constant frowning, lip biting, blushing annoyed the hell out of me. How on Earth can someone rich, wealthy like Christian be attracted to her ? (Not this version, though, he's in cringe mode all the time) So the book is terrible, but it's nowhere near this bad, the whole cast look like they are too embarrassed to be in this junk .Conclusion: Save the money for future generation."

","The movie was terrible...a terrible waste of time. The acting was horrible. I believe a 5 year old could have more cinematic experience than these actors. Their 'seductive pauses' were anything but seductive; and the 'sexual' content was lacking at best. You see the same pair of boobs constantly, and they're nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the same repetitive content, with no explanation, lingering, 'holding you' to make it to the end are a disappointment. When you finally make it to the end, it's so anti-climatic, you're just hoping the movie will end.<br/><br/>Both of them look 30-something in reality, and he is supposed to play a 27 year old? And what's she supposed to be 23? HA! And, what 27-year old billionaire ONLY drives Audi's? Just goes to show you, that they couldn't even afford to rent some cars to use in the background (Bugatti, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Porsche) -- I'm sure they got a good deal from the Audi endorsement, but...jeez they missed the mark! I wish I could get my money, and even more importantly, my time back, as this waste of time doesn't deserve the accolades it is getting for 'opening weekend success'. The book should get the credit, because the actor and actress let down the audience.<br/><br/>Spare yourself and wait for this movie to come out on a premium channel.

","Well....I didn't expect much. I read the books more than two years ago. (Yes, the writing was bad, as well as the storyline etc.) However I kinda liked it-THEN, because don't we all love fairy tales. Don't we (women) all want a guy who whoos us away and all that?!? Yes Christian introduced her into BDSM, so what. Yes that contract thing was totally ridiculous, so what. But I think a lot of women lost themselves in the story and dreamt of Christian and imagined him and the way things happened in our own way....BUT..seeing it on screen,realizing that there is no difference between 50 Shades of Grey and a cheap, lousy sex movie, apart from ""in that cheap, lousy sex movie there is actually stuff going on"" made me feel sooooo bad, because that book became real on screen and it showed me HOW BAD IT ACTUALLY IS!!! How bad the movie is and how bad the books are. And don't let me get started on the acting! Jamie...a piece of wood, Dakota...not good either! This cast...is soo bad!! But then, how could they have been anyhow, if everyone and their mom would have picked someone else anyway! And i believe that no actor would have been able to make this work...because in the end 50 Shades of Grey does not belong on screen! It's simply rubbish!!! I can't think of one good thing in that film..wait let me think...mmmhhh...the soundtrack probably, I guess. <br/><br/>But then, there's always the film industry...and with this movie/book will happened what happened before....with ""Lord of the Rings"" (good movie), ""Twiliight"" , ""Hunger Games""(good movie)...they will drag it out and torture us with two more sequels, although the critics say otherwise! But because there are so many people watching this movie (you, me, him, she, your neighbour....), they will make enough money to do so! And people will go and watch it..not because it's a good movie, or story, or the sex is good--NO, because this movie is like a car crash..you can't look away!! So the only thing is not to go and watch it, so that they can't make enough money for a sequel! But I guess that ship has sailed!"

","After seeing all the negative reviews I expected to not like the movie as much as the book, but I did. The beginning felt a little rushed but it was still good and followed the book well, which a lot of movies made from books don't always do. I love that Jamie Dornan was cast as Christian I thought he played him well. However I think they could've casted Anastasia better. Dakota Johnson played her well I just think she looked a lot older than 21, which is how old Ana is supposed to be. They could've casted someone who looks younger than 21 and that would've been better. Ana's roommate Kate was casted well too just like I pictured her when I read the book. I don't get what everyone's been saying about how Jamie and Dakota have zero chemistry, I thought they were great together, their scenes together were hot!! If you read the books you'll like the movie."

","As a purely layman movie viewer I do go to a lot of movies at the Regal nearby. I am the husband who was dragged to this movie by a wife who read all of the books and was infatuated. This review is just for you husbands and boyfriends that might wonder if you are wasting your Saturday afternoon or evening. You are not. When you include the storyline it is probably the best soft porn movie I have ever seen (and I have a seen a few). Most are so stupid they are hard to stomach. 50 SOFG was well written (actually much of the book verbatim I found out later) and very entertaining. The last thing in the world I like is chick flicks but this really kept my interest the entire time. Add helicopters, sports cars, and gliders to the mix and it was very good. I can't believe I am saying this but I will see #2 when it comes out as well. Anyway, it was well worth the ticket price for men.

","An abomination for people who have the sexual preference of BDSM. <br/><br/>False love, cinematic rape .... Thank you, Mr Grey...<br/><br/>You show us men how to rape our women and how to break their consent in ""rape-bonding"" intercourse.<br/><br/>I am terribly disappointed that the film is presented as a serious thing.<br/><br/>It is an insult to the community of people practicing BDSM in compliance, comfort and contentment.<br/><br/>For information:<br/><br/>BDSM is a variety of erotic practices involving dominance and submission, role-playing, restraint, and other interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent on self-identification and shared experience. Interest in BDSM can range from one-time experimentation to a lifestyle. Unlike the usual ""power neutral"" relationships and play styles commonly followed by couples, activities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the participants' taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of informed consent of both the partners becomes essential. Participants who exert sexual control over their partners are known as dominants or tops while participants who take the passive, receiving, or obedient role are known as submissives or bottoms. Aside from the general advice related to safe sex, BDSM sessions often require a wider array of safety precautions than vanilla sex."

","The novel is literally the first erotica I've ever read and I didn't even like it though it is fun and interesting in some way. The movie version is dull except all sex/BDSM scenes, however, I don't think it's that bad, considering it's based on, to many reviewers, such a crap book. Kudos to the director, screen play writer, and especially Dakota Johnson who actually delivered a solid performance.<br/><br/>Jamie Dornan's rendition of the protagonist Christian Grey, on the other hand, is simultaneously good and awful. He's simply a wooden doll when it comes to acting but this weakness also enables him to successfully bring Christian Grey to life."
"jtindahouse","6","8","17","14 February 2015"," Well executed but drags on a touch
","It's common knowledge American audiences aren't particularly comfortable with explicit sexuality in film. Look at Martin Scorsese's unbelievably brilliant 'The Wolf of Wall Street', all anyone could talk about was how much graphic sex there was throughout - completing overshadowing the masterpiece of a film itself. So I don't envy the filmmakers charged with the task of bringing the infamous '50 Shades of Grey' to the big screen. If they went too far with it people were going to be offended and if they didn't go far enough the fans would be let down. Keeping all this in mind I think they did a pretty good job.<br/><br/>You'd have to have had your head pretty firmly under a rock not to have heard anything about the rigorous casting process that went on to find the two leads for this film. You'd hope with the amount of thought and effort that seemed to go into it they would have made some good decisions. I'm pleased to say they did. Dakota Johnson particularly impressed me. She especially nailed the early scenes where the character of Anastasia Steele is still shy and awkward. Her transformation through the movie was well acted and believable. A very impressive performance. Jamie Dornan was not the first choice for the role of Christian Grey, and I have to admit that before going into the film and based entirely on looks, I wasn't entirely convinced. Any doubts I had though were erased pretty quickly and he encompassed the role very well. He found the perfect balance between charm and having a dark side that the audience wants to know more about.<br/><br/>125 minutes run time is pushing it a little for my liking because all the extra 20-30 succeed in doing is to frustrate the audience that we've already seen the extent of what they're willing to show us. It could never be said that this film pushed the envelope - if anything it certainly leans further towards the safe side. Having said that, had the film pushed any harder people would most likely have simply dismissed it as pornography. As previously mentioned I don't envy the decision makers in this instance. The actors sell it though and make the two hours very watchable. It also contains an interesting ending that I'd imagine wasn't an easy sell to the studio."

","I will admit that I read the reviews for this film and they were very discouraging. The opinions ranged from bad lighting to bad chemistry between Dakota and Jamie. Being a serial reader of the books I grew skeptical. I didn't want the books I love to become a movie I hated. So I decided the minute I bought the ticket that I would proceed with caution and an open mind. I am so glad I did.....<br/><br/>50 Shades of Grey was refreshingly sexy and thought out. The movie flowed as the first book did...at an introductory pace. We learned who Ana and Christian were, where they came from, and how those separate journeys lead them to each other. The chemistry was spot on and the cinematography was great as well. <br/><br/>Jamie portrayed the sexy, damaged, control freak wonderfully. Ironically Dakota gave life to Ana while dominating Christian's heart through beautiful confidence and humor. The intimacy was handled with care. When they made love they made love and when they got kinky it was refreshing to see something more enticing than plain ole missionary. Just saying. <br/><br/>Overall I gave it an 8 because there were book scenes I looked forward to that were excluded. Also, its only the first installment of a trilogy. With Dakota, Jamie, and Sam on board for Darker and Freed, Im saving the best rating for last ;-)"

","I have read the books, all 3! This movie followed the theme and important scenes in the book. The beginning portion of the movie was too rushed. The relationship between Steele and Grey was going from meeting for the first time, to all of sudden talking about being in a relationship. There was a lot more depth or quality interactions that led up to the initial sexual interaction in the book. The sex scenes were steamy. The serious scenes with lines, lacked delivery by actors. I'm not sure if it was lack of chemistry or the fact that they were so uncomfortable doing these scenes that they were not focusing on the lines and being realistic in the delivery. It seemed corny at times. There were one liners that added a little humor into a supposed dramatic movie, which made it feel childish. I wished it could have focused more on why Chrisitan Grey is the way he is, instead of spending 1/2 the movie with soft pornographic scenes that lacked depth, follow through and feeling. I'm sure this is to be continued in the sequel. A lot of hype, and I'm sure it will make a lot of money in the opening week. Dakota Johnson will get many more B and C grade acting jobs for her ability to bear all for the art. However the movie needs a lot more work and maybe even new actors."

I don't understand how people can say this movie was horrible or how it ""degrades"" women.. The books are a FANTASTY of a WOMAN. What is wrong with that? It's not fair when people who have no read the books, nor watched the movie, are talking bad about it when they don't even know what they are talking about. Even for the people who have read it.. If these books are not your style, then don't read it. Don't talk bad or try to discredit somebody's hard work. If these books were as bad as people are saying it is, how exactly did it make $100 million dollars in a 2 year period? These books were not meant to be a romantic English literature novel.

You can show the inner world of any of his hero, the ability to become different. You are very talented and a great actor.

The singularly tolerable thing about this movie was the soundtrack, but even then the horrendously filmed BDSM scenes have pretty much ruined any song by Ellie Goulding or The Weeknd for me.

Dakota Johnson did absolutely amazing! She was strong, sassy, vulnerable, and sexy. She grisly became Ana, but even better than the book portrayal of her character. Sam Taylor-Johnson looked more towards the under tones of the film.

","For everyone who didn't like the movie, either 1 of 2 things must have been at play: Either you don't like that type of genre of book or movie.<br/><br/>It's not a movie or book about porn!<br/><br/>It's more about Mr. Grey and Anastasia finding themselves and more about Christian working rough his F'd up life to finally find love and be happy... And yea, you don't get that in the first book or movie, or in the second or third books! Rather it's a combination of all three books that makes you realize that...<br/><br/>So if you didn't like it, I'll just assume either you don't like romance (even if it's F'd up) or you just haven't read the other books....stop expecting from the movies and go read the books with no expectations....you'll see what I mean<br/><br/>For those of us who read the books and enjoyed them, the movie was a pretty good adaptation. Of course the beating the book was more severe and there was that other beating in the book (the first time he spanked her) that affected her but didn't make it to the movie but so what? It's a movie...can't be perfect! For the most part, I think it captured the essence of the message...<br/><br/>And for those of you who can't tolerate the beatings, there's a reason for everything...go read the book! ***SPOILER ALERT*** Christian learns to deal with his F'd up life and doesn't beat Anastasia anymore....so get over it and read the damn book.<br/><br/>Of course they'll be those who read the books and didn't like them or read the books, loved them but didn't like the movie...this happens all of the time...

She is becoming stronger and putting her faith in another person when so many people in her life have let her down and he is learning that he doesn't have to control everything in is world I order to find happiness.

","This movie will appeal to some people and not to others. Some may be interested in the love story alone, or the Dom/Sub factor, or both, however unorthodox that the love story itself is or not depending on the viewers own taste, history, curiosity, filters of their own perception,etc. I thought that the leads did have great chemistry, despite another review's opinion that I have read. The writing was done much more tasteful than it could have been for some people that live that sort of private life, So you can see that the producers and writer were careful in some respects not to offend some viewers that may be startled by this sort of subject. The intricacies of relationship dynamic and how each of the lead's characters try to understand each other and heal from their own emotional and mental wounds from their childhood present an interesting dynamic of why their characters are drawn to each other as if to balance out each other's opposites in characteristics and approach to life and how to be happy in it in their own way and finding a way to do that together while at the same time being drawn to each other in a very passionate way. <br/><br/>Regardless of any review that a person reads about this film they would not only have to pay to see it themselves to decide for themselves, but also take into account that some people will give it a review opposite to your own once you see it depending on your own taste and comfort level. <br/><br/>When does the movie sequel come out for book 2 and 3 with the same actors to tell the rest of the story? You can't start a story and not finish it - it would be wrong to not complete it for those who paid to watch the story from beginning to end. Make the 2nd & 3rd movie."

The acting was really poor, zero chemistry, really forced faces and talking, awful accent by Jamie. Awkoward at times, really makes you want to leave. Well... maybe I went to far with that ""shitty erotic movie"" thing. This is actually worse, in those movies women are treated as... well, women. This movie shows Anastasia (Dakota) as a sex toy with long hair and beautiful eyes being abused in many ways. Some years before this would've make the director go to prison... or at least it would've made the same middle-aged women that now call this ""art"" being REALLY mad. This movie has nothing to sustain from, there's no ethical/philosophical theme brought to the table, just two people having sex, he abuses her, she tries to make him change with her ""love"". Really boring overused stuff.It doesn't get deeper than that. I really want to say something good about it, but I just can't, even the music was poor.

It was not about romance or even about sex - as everyone says - it's about controlling a person - Anastasia -, controlling every detail, every aspect of her life, even sex... and also telling her in many different ways that he wants to hurt her. <br/><br/>The movie is bad. Boring, too long, no chemistry between the actors... The story is OK (so so). At least Anastasia is not as submissive as Grey wants but she tolerates a manipulative,jealous, controlling and abusive guy just because she wants him to love her...

"terrikascottwalker","9","6","12","21 February 2015"," I Enjoyed Fifty Shades....
","First, let me begin by saying I truly enjoyed the film. I appreciate the complexity of the characters and the strained connection between them. I think, in my humble opinion, that many of the reviews I have read are more appalled by the subject matter and not the human experiences that define the story. When you read the novel, you understand that one of Grey's devastating flaws is his inability to connect with others....his inability to be emotionally intimate. So, those moments in the film where you see him actually emotionally present with Ana are accompanied by his inherent resistance to exist in spaces where he lacks control. The actor who portrays Christian does this beautifully. He is not warm and fuzzy. He is an adult coping with haunting images from his childhood, and an unusual sexual appetite born out of an inappropriate relationship that an adult female began with a wounded teenage boy. <br/><br/>That's the story. It is what it is. I hope that reviewers are not hating on the film because the subject matter makes them uncomfortable. For me, I can't watch scary films or films with gratuitous blood and guts or films that depict rape of any kind. But I'm not going to be critical of a film for covering subject matter of which I personally might be uncomfortable. Shawshank Redemption was an amazing film, but I didn't watch the rape scene. Never will, but its inclusion in the film doesn't take away from the authentic representation of complicated and exquisitely developed characters and a truly compelling story. <br/><br/>I believe that Fifty Shades of Grey was a beautiful depiction of a very complicated relationship between two people with parallel desires that reside in two vastly different planes and their struggle to find a place, mutual ground between them, where they can both feel safe. And at the end of this film, the end of the first book, Christian learns, maybe for the first time in his life, that physical punishment is an inadequate means to control someone else's emotion. He wanted Ana in his way without her genuinely wanting him in return. That didn't work...neither did his punishment. It hadn't occurred to him that in his desperate attempt to control everything, he could lose the one person who'd genuinely cared for him. Let's not forget Ana is no helpless victim. She was very clear about her position and when Christian crossed the line, she walked away. <br/><br/>Just an alternative perspective.....<br/><br/>-TDSWALK"

","50 Shades of Grey lurks into a dark world we don't see many Hollywood films venture into. Even though this movie is a book adaptation, it shines with originality as well as character. If you're someone who has read the book, and also never like movie adaptations, save yourself some time; this may not be for you.<br/><br/>For those looking for saucy dark romantic film, you may want to check this out. There is little chance you haven't heard something about this film. The book was big a few years ago and finally made it to the big screen, and for good reason. The story is grasping and keeps you interested throughout; even though it seems like its never moving onto the next act. That's actually one of the beauties of it: it flows very well and ends with you at the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Once we are introduced to the two main characters, you don't feel the chemistry right away. In fact, you don't really feel it most of the film. This is not because of poor acting or writing, this was intentional. The story unfolds into a plot that is subtle and minuscule. But as the movie progresses, you start to see a darker and darker tone, and much closer and needed chemistry between the two main characters. This is what absorbs you into both the characters and the story, something that not many films do. There is no romantic clich√É¬©. Don't expect the ""two people meet fall in love fight then fall back in love"" formula here.<br/><br/>Go into this film with an open, clear mind. Erase what super-fans have told you and keep all bias opinions out the theater door. Do this, and there will be a unique story on the big screen waiting for you."

It is a romance but told in a different way I enjoyed it and would watch it again bring in the next one. There may have not been much sexual tension in the movie but there was some Ana (Dakota) pulled it off by looking more nervous of Mr Grey which then the audience was able to turn that in to sexual tension between them both. Slightly upset that I missed the teaser at the end of the credits for the next one so i will be trying to find it on YouTube.

","For starters, I only managed to get through a portion of the first book before tossing it into a donation box. The writing was repetitive, unimaginative and reminiscent of an ammeter, teen fantasy diary rather than a novel. <br/><br/>Jamie Dornan: Honestly, I never knew who he was until I watched the series, The Fall, which he plays a very intense character - serial killer. I adore his character in this show. He is understated, serious, methodical, and a brilliant antagonist to Gillian Anderson's role. <br/><br/>Sadly, his skills as an actor are overshadowed by poor dialogue, piecemeal scenes and terrible continuity. Just like the book(s)<br/><br/>Dakota Johnson: Another actor I've never heard of and it is hard to tell whether she is good at her craft due to the horrible dialogue. <br/><br/>The two lead actors had zero chemistry between them. Because of this, their scenes together were lack luster and even the sex was boring and uninspiring. <br/><br/>Christian Gray is damaged goods. He is emotionally stunted due to abuse at a young age, and worse yet, molested by mommy's predictor bestie in his teen years. Alas, that may have been a better story if someone else wrote it. <br/><br/>The worst part about this movie? How many people rushed to the box office, dropped their hard earned money in the hands of an industry that knew this film was built on a load of tripe, though, they cashed in opening week due to the hype over tripe. Much like Twilight, you'd think movie goers would have learned their lesson. <br/><br/>Sex sells, yes? But that is a completely different industry. Don't waste your money on this film, or the books if you value your intelligence and brain cells. The creators knew this was a baseless cash in. Don't line their pockets for a poor product."

","Amazing. Loved every minute. Great chemistry between Anna and Christian. True to book. Yes some stuff missed out but you can't put every scene from the book in the film. It would be too long. Can't wait for 2nd film. Yes the ending is sad but it's the same as the book. The whole thing is very well acted especially the ending. Lots of funny bits in it too. It is not porn, it is a beautiful love story. If you haven't read the books then you need to before watching this. Christian is the way he is due to his rubbish start in life. Anna sees through him and seeks to make him love himself. Everything he does is because he loves her. It just takes him awhile to realise and admit that he does. It all turns out fine in the end. Love Grace and Carrick and Kate is gorgeous. Elliot is not as gorgeous as I was expecting."

","Having read all three books, my imagination showed me a movie that no one will ever be able to remove a reality. Therefore, from the movie did not expect the impossible. Realizing that for the same time and a half hours, a priori, does not really convey those moments and those nuances which firmly established history book version. The main task of directors, actors, as for me), meet people read visually trilogy - and that they came out with a bang!) But there is a contingent (not small by the way), whose motto - ""Why read when you can see"", ignore that they had no right. As far as it was possible to combine the main, plot points and atmospheric (specific details, dialogues, situations) in such a short period of time, in this regard, the team reached the fifty golden mean, and Dakota and Dornan supplemented and completed the picture. 10 solid 9 for filming but those are not big highlights of the novel, well, especially for the performance of the roles of the main characters, applause, curtain)<br/><br/>P.S. People who so vigorously trying to make a reasoned, well- founded criticism of this film, clearly demonstrate their implication complexes, problems, and so n. By the mediocre - indifferent, and the ardor of angry comments proves exactly the opposite. Thanks to the team for their work. Well done!"

","As a movie that has been hyped in all different ways - BDSM encouraging, feminist offender, female-freedom inspiring - we can say it surpasses all expectations. And that's not much.<br/><br/>Inspired by the novel by E. L. James (which has been called sophomoric and amateur), the page-to-screen transition has been done successfully. Even if you can feel the exact lines taken from the book sounding cheesy among the speech adaptations, all the worst lines are gone, but you can find lots of Christian's I-can-play-the- piano moments.<br/><br/>The movie goes fast-then-slow, paced strangely between little gags and seriously-taken moments. It never stops, though.<br/><br/>Dakota Johnson steals the movie for most of the time. Her performance is so builded-up as the movie goes that you can actually feel the journey she's going through. Jamie Dornan, as unfittable as he might have looked in the previews, ""is"" Mr. Grey. His shadowy behavior and self-trust is perfect.<br/><br/>Luke Grimes, Rita Ora, Eloise Mumford, all fitting their roles. Jos√É¬©, though, seems too forced. Supporting roles are reduced to a minimum, making the whole movie feel like an intimate observation of their relationship.<br/><br/>Sam Taylor-Wood seems to have done her best with the source material (even with the original author limitations on her work). It's a rare situation when the film surpasses the book by miles. She knows almost exactly when to play funny and when to go hard. Cinematography is top-notch, even if the aerial shots look reminiscent of Twilight. <br/><br/>It's a beautiful movie that tries to go deep, steps back and then ends abruptly just when you wanted more."

"composertrevor","7","4","7","21 July 2015"," Similarities with other films
","Fifty Shades of Grey has a formulaic quality that puts it alongside films such as 'Maid in Manhattan' and 'The Devil wears Prada'. At the beginning, Anastasia presents herself to Christian Grey and his assistants in a frumpy outfit that hardly fits with the professional environment. In 'The Devil wears Prada', Andrea has an identical situation in being outside the fashion statements of Runway magazine as she also arrives at the office looking frumpy. Both characters get sucked into their respective new worlds - Andrea into the corporate fashion hypnosis, and Anastasia into Christian Grey's hypnosis. Just as Marisa crosses over into the world of Assembly man Chris. Marshall as the Manhattan maid, so Ana's situation is similar. In both cases, the basic human activity is girl meets boy.<br/><br/>Chemistry between Ana and Christian is not as flawed as some have asserted. Ana is slowly trying to understand the strange new world she is entering, and this develops as the film unfolds. Members of the BDSM world who say they wouldn't do what the film's characters do fail to recognise that everyone is different. What Christian and Ana do is unique to them, and so cannot be attached to a text book life style.<br/><br/>There are some reasonable sub-plots, small though they are. The two mothers and Ana's friends and family provide the contrast.<br/><br/>As a romantic/erotic genre, I wouldn't expect the film to be an intense set of character studies that might be found in other films. Fifty Shades of Grey works on its own terms, even if those terms are unique."

","I thought I've seen some bad movies in my time. But this does take the cake. And the cigar. And the cherry on top. This thing (I'm reluctant to call it a movie) is so ridiculously, incredibly bad that I'm genuinely feeling sorry for myself for having wasted 2.5 hours of my precious life on this. And even the fact that my wife now appreciates the effort that I've made by watching this with her can't make me feel any better.<br/><br/>This film fails on every level. The nonsensical script feels like something that was written by a 15 year old who'd been watching too many music videos. We all know the source wasn't great literature to start with, but the script apparently stays close enough to the novel, making it just as bad if not worse. <br/><br/>The acting is depressingly irritating. Jamie Dornan's character is supposed to be a charismatic dominant. Instead he is a robot with a single voice tonality. Dakota Johnson is trying her best not to laugh, and I can't blame her really, but unfortunately it does nothing for her acting. And since most of the screen time is shared between those two their lack of chemistry is too obvious.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is nauseatingly predictable. Not a single courageous choice there, nothing memorable or emotionally involving.<br/><br/>Lastly, I think this movie completely outdid itself by making sex scenes not sexy. Arguably BDSM isn't everyone's cup of tea, but not every sex scene here is BDSM. And yet this surely was the first movie I've ever watched where I found myself falling asleep during almost every scene involving some kind of intimacy. In fact, I felt compelled to skip forward a few times because I just couldn't be bothered with watching those two make sex look unappealing.<br/><br/>And now I know that I'll probably have to spend another 5 hours watching the second and third installments of this thing, and it's enough to make want to hit the bottle.<br/><br/>No redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>1/10 (way too generous)"

","I was wary of watching this film when it first came out, I heard a lot of negative things about the book and decided it wasn't my cup of tea. However, a lot of my friends who were my own age couldn't stop talking about how much they loved it, and a lot of them assured me that the biggest problem I had with the book, (misinformation of BDSM, romanisation of abuse) wasn't as bad as sounded it. I read a few extracts from the book and found the writing style cringe worthy, so I decided to watch the film, hoping I could at least enjoy the storyline. Turns out I was right about Fifty Shades Of Grey from the start.<br/><br/>Ana is a weak, one dimensional protagonist and boring overall. Christian was actually a rather interesting character, however he is not likable as a human being, and because of that, I found it hard to route for him.<br/><br/>Fifty Shades Of Grey portrays BDSM as a relationship where the dominant has control of every aspect of the submissive's life. This is not true. A relationship between a dominant and a submissive is just like any other relationship, the only difference is that sexual activities include SAFE and CONSENSUAL violence from time to time. As Ana's dominant, Christian controls what Ana eats, doesn't allow her to drink or smoke, makes her address him as Sir at all times and does many other controlling things. This is NOT how BDSM works, this is blatant abuse. I'm not even going to talk about how he neglects to inform Ana of what he's going to do to her before actually doing it. <br/><br/>Overall, Fifty Shades Of Grey is a boring, ridiculous and unrealistic story with cringe worthy dialogue."

","One must try - and inevitably fail - not to adopt a patronising tone when reviewing FIFTY SHADES The novel, whose literary merit is neither here nor there (and certainly not there) - launched a new genre of its own - Porno Lite - and so, I fear, will the movie. I'm pretty sure bondage involves more than a few smacks on the bum and lots of kissing, which seems to be about as far as an 18 rating allowed Sam Taylor-Johnson to go.<br/><br/>The movie's fatal flaw is the lack of chemistry between the two leads. They are acting out an attraction they clearly do not feel. Dakota Johnson tries to play it feisty and vulnerable but comes over as a bit bland. Jamie Dornan, who was glamorous and creepy as the serial killer tracked down by Gillian Anderson in THE FALL on BBCtv, is not glamorous enough here - and rather deficient in creepiness. Apart from his under- used dungeon playroom, even the furnishings in his billionaire bachelor pad (and his suits) look as if they came from the high street rather than high-end designers. The whole movie is - sorry about this - more M&S than S&M.<br/><br/>If there is to be a screen sequel - FIFTY SHADES DARKER - I wonder, without much enthusiasm, if some of the contraptions briefly glimpsed in Christian's chamber of horrors will be brought into play. How far can the line between porno and mainstream be blurred? It was much more stylishly crossed in 9 1/2 WEEKS."

"JSValentine","1","7","15","5 March 2015"," Fifty Shades of romanticised domestic abuse
","Right. First thing's first, before I launch into an enraged monologue, I will attempt to review Fifty Shades of Grey as a film, as this is technically a film review. It is awful. Not so-bad-it's- good awful. Not hilarious awful. Not even a friend made me watch it and I fell asleep awful. Actually awful. I have personally never seen either of the lead actors in anything else but I've seen better acting in the amateur dramatics plays in my local village after everyone's had six too many pints at the pub before the evening performance. Not that they can be entirely blamed of course, when the film (and, I'm assuming, the book, which I never intend to read) has utterly no plot and the writing is genuinely embarrassingly bad. <br/><br/>So yes, the film is terrible, but now to the real issue. I had heard a lot of the controversy about this film and feel strongly about some of the issues raised, but felt as though I should watch the film so that my arguments would been grounded in actual knowledge, so as not to seem hypocritical or ill-informed. So I sat down and watched it. I can honestly say I have never been so traumatised in my life. To add some context, I am a great lover of horror films, and this film was the most terrifying experience of my life. I cried on multiple occasions during the film and when it finished, I sat in a state of shock for a whole ten minutes, my body shaking uncontrollably.<br/><br/>As someone who has been a victim of domestic abuse in the past, I tend to avoid films that depict violence, control and emotional manipulation in the context of a relationship. Films such as these are usually marketed as psychological thrillers. Not romances. The way in which Fifty Shades was marketed genuinely appals me. The fact that audiences are being told that domestic abuse is not only acceptable because 'he had a tough childhood' but also romantic and desirably is utterly disgusting. It's not only unpleasant, distasteful and misogynistic, it goes much further than that. It is violating, insulting and most of all actually traumatic for people like me. For a film to bring back old memories of abuse is bad enough. For that same film to convey that those experiences were not horrific but in fact romantic and exciting is utterly unforgivable.<br/><br/>If you have been a victim of abuse, do not under any circumstances watch this film as it will cause you a great deal of pain. Anyone else reading this, understand that Fifty Shades of Grey is a horrendously misinformed mistake that should never have found its way into popular culture."
"Joymorrisjackie","1","7","15","19 February 2015"," 50 shades of disappointment
","I usually don't write movie reviews I'm not a critic, I'm just a Moviegoer and a book reader. During late 2014 while I was bedridden my friends constantly suggested that I read a book that was very popular at the time called ""50 shades of Grey"". It was actually a trilogy, a love story an erotic novel. More attracted to biographies, I still decided to give it a try. Although called ""mommy porn"" by many critics, I disagree. I felt it was entertaining and interesting. No, it's not English literature.!! You know this when you go and buy the book, so that should not come as a surprise. Nothing wrong with some light reading every now and then! I found the books to be entertaining and what you might call ""a guilty pleasure"". <br/><br/>The casting and the chemistry are the number one priorities to make this story work on film. This is what I found TOTALLY lacking in the movie version. The movie version is not sexy. The book is so much better. The screenplay is a watered-down version of the book to the extent that those of you who never read the book will not understand the relationship between these two characters in the film or understand the reason why this girl could ever fall in love with a man like Christian Grey. In the movie he just comes off as a creepy stalker with no real or deep feelings. The film looks more like a bad summary of a real movie. <br/><br/>Jamie Dornan who plays Christian Grey has a serious problem with his Irish accent and it kind of spills out. There is also a lack of depth in his character. It is one dimensional during the whole 2 hours and five minutes. Making it hard for the audience to empathize with him. He comes off as moody, never seductive, playful or sweet which would have made us root for the character and the love story. All qualities that come off very clear in the book along with his mercurial personality which shows off his more scary and unstable side. This is also missing from the movie! Looking serious all the time is not the same as being dark and mercurial. I left the movie theater feeling that I should have spent my money elsewhere. Let me remind you that I am writing as a fan of the book trilogy, not a hater.<br/><br/>Part of what makes Christian Grey a likable character is seeing his lighter playful side which usually comes out in the book when he's writing emails to Anastasia It is here where you start to see their more light and playful dynamic. At no point in the movie is there any sort of reference to this side of him. <br/><br/>There are pivotal moments in the book that show you who these people are and how they function and affect each other which were absolutely ignored in the movie. How can you justify the characters actions if the back story to them is not exposed? How can you empathize with the characters when you never get to know who they are? <br/><br/>Let us review some of the information that was missing:<br/><br/>1- In the book Ana is uncomfortable with Christian's wealth and dislikes the fact he is constantly showering her with expensive gifts. It makes her feel cheap. In the movie that doesn't come off, on the contrary you could even think that his money Is the reason she likes him to begin with. Not having that made clear changes the whole storyline and the dynamic of this relationship. The movie does a poor job of making this clear.<br/><br/>2- To understand the outburst of passion in the much publicized elevator scene, you should have been given a better view of what was going on between them from the beginning. That scene made no since in the movie, it came from no where and it was lacking the HEAT that these two people feel for each other. It was played way to safe by the actors and director. It did not look like a ""fuck the paperwork"" kind of first kiss. <br/><br/>3- Christian's family dynamic is completely ignored!!!!!. His relationship with his parents and siblings is absolutely ignored in the movie and would have given the viewer an idea of the loving environment that gives him his good, grounded and honest side. It marks the contrast and explains the duality that is Grey. <br/><br/>4- When Christian finds out about Ana's virginity in the book, he freaks out and is in complete shock. He is upset with himself for not having noticed just how innocent this girl was. This says a lot about him. The movies approach is cold and impersonal. Her virginity comes off as something to deal with as fast as possible so he can move on to kinkier things. In the book you see he cares for her more that he can comprehend. Again in the movie he doesn't really seem to care much about anything except the contract. <br/><br/>5- Ana's relationship with her roommate is also a key element. During her whole relationship with Christian Ana's roommate (kate) is terribly critical of Christian, feeling he is dangerous for Ana.. In this movie, the poor girl does not exist at all! She might as well been a ""prop""...... which brings me to the following point: All the actors in the movie aside from the two main characters seem to have been hired as ""props"" since they don't tell their story or add to the main story at all. What a waste of hired talent. As a fan of the trilogy I give this film a painful two thumbs down. <br/><br/>I would have been happy with ""plain old vanilla"" but what I got instead was an empty ice cream bowl.!!"

","I haven't read the books, but I had read a lot of the reviews before going to see this with my wife, so I could give myself a head start on what to expect. I found that a lot of the reviews were actually really unfair and based on a pre-conceived idea of whether the film would be good or bad - which is no way to review a movie. Open your eyes and be honest with yourself about how it made you feel, not what the media hype and controversy says! So, with an open mind I watched. I was entertained in parts, intrigued in others, and disappointed in a number of places. The main problem for me (having not read the books) is that there are too many questions/things that didn't add up, which made it frustrating to watch, and there were some parts of the movie where I was starting to get a bit bored...<br/><br/>The screenplay isn't great, but I hear the book isn't exactly a masterpiece, so that makes sense. That did limit some of the acting in parts, but on the whole the character portrayals from the key names were superb. I 100% bought into the character of Christian Grey because Jamie Dornan made him believable, genuine, and intriguing - he is clearly a very deep character with many layers that unfortunately weren't explored enough (not his fault). I was less convinced with Dakota Johnson's character, mainly because she spent more time biting her lip than doing anything useful - but I understand the reasons why. The problem with her wasn't the acting, but again the character didn't have enough background to convince me - her behaviour confused me because I think key details about why she thinks/feels the way she does weren't explored.<br/><br/>The contract scene was fantastic - it was slick, smart, well acted, and by far the best scene in the movie. The sex scenes weren't bad, leaving just enough to the imagination, and not so over-acted that they seemed cheesy.<br/><br/>The stand out piece for me was the soundtrack, which was moody, seductive, modern, and set the mood well for each scene.<br/><br/>Overall, the film left me with too many questions, sure they might be answered by the sequels, but at this point there's just blank space. It definitely promoted healthy discussion, and some of the acting was impressive. Bottom line, it is far from a classic, but a guaranteed money maker (as opening weekend proved)."

","I am about to throw down on the Fifty Shades front. There are spoilers if you haven't read the books or seen the movie.<br/><br/>Anytime a movie adaptation is made, it is hard to live up to the book and there is always outrage over the actors selected. It's hard to meet the vision of the characters that are created in a book. I personally am a fan of actor, Jamie Dornan, and I thought he was great as Christian Grey. I was indifferent when it came to who played Anastasia, but Dakota Johnson did fine.<br/><br/>The movie played pretty true to the book. If you didn't like the books you aren't gonna like the movie. The parts of the book that made me roll my eyes, made me roll my eyes in the movie. The lines from the book that were cringe worthy, (""Laters, baby"", anyone?), were cringe worthy in the movie. That being said, I was a fan of the actual storyline from the book, so I enjoyed the movie. This isn't a romantic comedy people. It is about a man with a troubled past who has ""singular"" tastes when it comes to being with women. These tastes stem from that troubled past (which people seem to forget). He falls for a girl who has never been exposed to his type of sexual lifestyle but is interested in him enough to give it a try. The reviews about how this story degrades women, how it has set us back, and that it's domestic abuse kill me. Did these people actually read the books or watch the movie? Everything was consensual and when she decided it wasn't the lifestyle she wanted ‚Äì guess what? She left. I personally thought the sex scenes in the book were really repetitive so I was glad that the movie wasn't just chock full of them. There are obviously a few and they show as much as a Rated R movie can allow.<br/><br/>This isn't an Oscar award winning movie, but it isn't as bad as some reviews would have you think.

Dakota Johnson is slightly better than Jamie Dornan but sill pretty bad.There was something seriously wrong with the cast choice...<br/><br/>Jamie and Dakota have zero on-screen chemistry in my opinion and everything about their relationship seemed incredibly forced and predictable. Their ""romantic""adventures are just as exciting as watching a freshly painted wall dry. <br/><br/>The other major problem with the movie was that the lines were a mere copy-paste from the book. There was no creativity or imagination when it came to transforming the book into a movie. The line 'Laters,baby' was by far the worst. It was so unnatural that it made it look like the actor was actually reading the script right there rather than acting. The only reason why this movie is selling out theatres around the globe is because people are curious and have no idea how bad it actually is. When the movie was finally over and the lights were on again,everyone in the room was laughing and commenting on about how much of a joke it had all been.<br/><br/>Having just said this, I only regret that this is a trilogy and that we're going to have to go through two more films (well, not me anyway,because I won't waste another penny on this).

A seemingly taboo theme gets loads of attention; but it's so incredibly awfully made that no one particularly cares.<br/><br/>The movie comes off as a soap opera, an episode of The Bachelor, and an excruciatingly soft (read here: barely explicit) porno all in one.<br/><br/>While folks joked that they wouldn't be able to hear the movie over the din of vibrators; the loudest thing in the auditorium was actually countless men snoring, having been dragged along by their dangerously unfulfilled wives.<br/><br/>I'm afraid it did not receive a rose. Fifty Shades gets a big 1/10, simply because IMDb does not permit a zero. Easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen."

","Soo... I've purchased the first book and had to put it down because I just couldn't tolerate it. Then, today I was sitting at home, lonely and bored, and was like ""what the **, I should go see that damn movie"". I prepared myself in advance, sneaking some booze in (later, it proved to be insufficient so I had to purchase another drink). So yeah. I've enjoyed the imagery, the clean-shot scenes, the soundtrack (which was too good for this movie) and, yes, the dialogue. I found it to be HILARIOUS! And apparently it wasn't just me: many people in the cinema laughed out loud during what was supposed to be ""serious and sensual scenes"", and I and the girl next to me kept making snide remarks like ""don't go in there, Ana!"". Other than that, the movie was surprisingly BLAND. No sexual sounds of any kind, no blood or bruises, and the ""most awful punishment"" was just six whips on the butt? I left happy knowing that my (currently non- existing) sex life is more exciting than that, but also worried because the movie ended abruptly, suggesting that there will be two more coming out? Nooooo! Yet, my only regret is wasting $13 for the ticket. Oh well. Verdict: watch Silence of the Lambs instead. Hannibal Lecter is way more sexy than Christian. I only give it a 2/10 because I liked the imagery and soundtrack and because I feel generous today.<br/><br/>On a side note: did anyone else noticed ugly sores/burns on Christian's body that looked like ringworm? What was that?"

To those that have no obvious clue, maybe you should study just a bit on the D/s lifestyle and how it encompasses SSC (Safe, Sane and Consensual) and note that during the movie Anastassia was asked, repeatedly, if she consented.

"nicodiezmckenna","10","9","21","21 July 2015"," Overall, a good movie.
","Fifty Shades of Grey is an excellent love story about Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. I found the movie full of emotions which I feel that people can relate to. I feel as if some people expect this to be a pornography, which it is not. I have heard bad reviews mainly because it wasn't as explicit as people desired. In terms of an erotic romance it ticks all the boxes. Most of all, it leaves you wanting more which is a perfect thing to do, especially if the next movie isn't out till 2017. I do not recommend watching this with anyone that you would be uncomfortable watching sex scenes or seeing nudity. 10 out of 10 for an erotic romance movie and not a pornography!"

","To be honest, I never have high expectations of movies that generate so much hype before anyone even saw them, but sure I was curious to see what this is all about. I was stupid enough to think US producers finally came to terms with sexual topics but then again, it doesn't get any more dull than that. The acting and the entire cast are into this and they are trying their best to deliver some sort of performance, but the script is so shallow and the dialog so cheesy that I wonder how many people will be brave enough to ask for their money back as in the end you are left with a feeling of being totally ripped off by Hollywood! If you want to see some real taboo sexual topics, go watch an European production, cause nothing will even come out of the US without being hand picked for the entertained minds...shame this time there isn't even a hint of entertainment!"

","This is the first truly great adult romance I've seen. I was surprised that even my wife rates this as one of the best shes ever seen, and at age 66 she's seen a LOT of movies.<br/><br/>By adult, I mean you actually have to be an adult to enjoy. My grandson had taken a date to see this movie and was totally embarrassed. my daughter heard about it from him and developed a negative impression, even though she has never seen the actual movie.<br/><br/>The love story is truly one-sided in the first book. Ana falls deeply in love with Christian almost from the first moment they meet, but his childhood traumas cause him to be unable to give or receive love in the normal manner.<br/><br/>However, Ana is a surprise to Christian almost from the first moment he sees her. To fully understand the movie you have to look at the subtle clues. Ana tells you them at the very beginning. She is NO DUMMY. She has a 4.0 average in college. So she not going to be easily hood-winked into a situation that would destroy her.<br/><br/>from the first, it is never Christian in charge, it is always Ana. Just watch as everything Christian says he would never do, or even consider doing seems to fall apart.<br/><br/>He would NEVER sleep in the same bed with a woman, but from their first night - he does with Ana.<br/><br/>He never kisses a woman without a NDA - but he does with Ana.<br/><br/>He never takes a girl in his helicopter - but he does with Ana.<br/><br/>He never has to negotiate the Contract with a SUB - but he does with Ana.<br/><br/>And the business meeting where he is totally in control, Ana ends up running over him like a freight train at the end.<br/><br/>In the end it is his own foolish act that destroys the relationship and leaves both of them totally devastated, and ONLY Christian has to change in order to salvage that which they both will need to survive.<br/><br/>A modern day 'Pride and Prejudice' story which, when viewed through the lens of understanding, blazes off the screen and takes you along on a fantastic roller coaster ride.<br/><br/>Hats off to the author and director, and the bravery of two young artists to pull this off."

","I literally followed the progress of this movie from day one. Saw it tonight at an early screening and absolutely loved it! I was completely satisfied! It was different enough from the book so it wasn't verbatim, yet still stayed true to the story! I was on the fence with the casting, simply because I wasn't entirely sure about the sexual chemistry between the two. But after watching, I'm VERY satisfied! They were absolutely GREAT together! The sex scenes were tastefully done, yet still raunchy and sexy as well as sensual! The soundtrack was great as well! Had me in goosebumps at several points of the movie!

","I was extremely worried about seeing the movie having read the trilogy 10 times (going on 11) and so I was not expecting too much just so I wouldn't be disappointed. I was VERY pleasantly surprised on how well the story was portrayed in the movie. Obviously it will never be as good as the book (what movie is?) but I will definitely be seeing the movie again, tomorrow actually. It was believable and really captivated the entire audience. Many complain that the movie was awkward but if you read the books you would understand that its supposed to be awkward. This love story is not a typical one and that's the thrill of it all. If you're a prude (which most of these critics seem to be) you will not like this movie. People also complain that this movie glamorizes domestic violence which is just ridiculous. I do not want to spoil the movie for anyone but I will say that the film deals with two CONSENTING adults and again, if you're a prude, don't watch the movie. I absolutely loved the movie and I cannot wait to see it again, a must see!"
"missBradshaw","10","16","44","13 February 2015"," Loved it!
","I think people are there are too picky, or simply it's high expectations due to the whole built up of that movie, I have seen it last night and it's what I thought it would be:) of course it wasn't going to be ""detailed"" to the movie, that's obvious, it would of been a soft porn in that case. OK so the book wasn't the best written book clearly, having said that it's about the movie not the book here, its entertaining just like the book was and to take lightly, in the end it's simply a love story. About the acting for sure Dakota was breathing Anastasia, she nailed it and couldn't imagine anyone else but her for this role, she was just great. As Jamie, also I think he's perfect for the role, Christian is not a warm outgoing character so it's obvious he wasn't going to jump up the screen. As for the chemistry with Dakota in the movie, here's my thoughts... i think Jamie who is not the most experience actor, was in the position at the time that I think may have prevented him to fully be emerge so do speak within his character and substantially Dakota, he had a newly wife on tow on location about to give birth so I'm sure being in that phase, may have impare his acting, again, as passionate etc wise I mean. Would he had been away from family, maybe he would have had more time to connect with Dakota and maybe more sparks could have been seen, my humble opinion that is. I have seen in the past when spouse is around the ""acting"" gets different. Hopefully for the sequel the wife will stay away during shooting and he will get a bit more ""into"" character and get that sparks that is the the books between the characters.<br/><br/>Again, entertaining movie, nothing massively absurd, simply a different love story than Hollywood through at us regularly. Well directed and if you are a fan of the book you will like."

","This wasn't a movie that I would be interested but, as my wife had read all the books and wanted to see the movie I decided to go along and watch the movie with her.<br/><br/>One way or the other I wanted to see if all the media hype around this movie was justified or not. The lead actors weren't known or interesting to me, so I wasn't expecting some off the wall interpretations.<br/><br/>The story plays around a young woman that replaces her friend in an interview of a young wealthy business man, and is attracted by his charm and wits, as he is to her.<br/><br/>The next almost two hours of movie we can see their relationship growing, into his kinky sexual preferences that she sometimes doesn't understand, trying to make him love her the ""normal way"", without physical pain. Which she only endures because he is rich, otherwise this would be called sexual harassment.<br/><br/>This said, the story is kind of flat, monotonous, and doesn't prove or show all the explicit sex the media is trying to sell to us. People that I talked to that read the books said that the movie doesn't show 1/10 of the sexuality of the original story ‚Äì rating oblige??!!. The interpretations seam competent com a slight relevance to Dakota Johnson over Jamie Dornan. For someone that didn't read the books, it seemed like a competent movie but not very interesting and It was made clearly to make dividends on the popularity of the books."

Christian Grey practically physical abused Ana Steele. So romantic. If heloved her so much then why would he even hit her. All he does is just strip her and have sex with her. For those who tell me that you need to read the book to understand why he hits her and practically rapes her, then I guess you could say that the book is stupid.

"ironhorse_iv","3","5","10","28 February 2015"," This was indeed, Fifty Shades of F*** up!
","My safe word should had been 'turn off', because this movie was indeed torture, when watching. I don't know why I watch, such crap. I guess, I was really hoping the movie was going to be, 'it's so bad, it's good'; type of a movie, which it wasn't. Based off the bestselling Twilight Fan Fiction-turned erotic novel of the same name, the adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey tells the story of Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), a naive literature student, that falls in love with wealthy Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), only to find out, a dark side about him, where Grey is consumed by the need to control everything. Can Anastasia Steele saved Christian Grey's tormented soul or will she submit to his every demand? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the movie, this movie was truly painful, insulting, and really dumb to watch. The movie never reaches a satisfying climax in the awful third act. The whole movie felt like just one giant setup for the sequels. A movie like this, should be a stand-alone movie, as it's the introduction piece. The movie is directionless. No wonder why director Sam Taylor-Johnson & author E. L. James fought endlessly about the film's direction. I went into this, with extremely low expectations. I was really trying to give this movie, a chance, because the source material was already pretty bad. I knew, coming in, that movie wasn't going to be in the same highbrow levels of writing, that great taboo erotic films, had such as 1962's Lolita or 1967's Belle de Jour. After all, the book was indeed, hilarious bad, with its bad dialogue, awkward story-telling, and unrealistic tone. A lot of the story seem clich√©s, influence, or rip off from better works, like 2002's Secretary & 1972's Last Tango in Paris. Much of the novel's charm, come from the laughable narrative and outrageous sex scenes. I was really looking forward to that. Sadly, it didn't have, any of those things. Since the narrative was indeed missing from the film; it was really hard to connect to what Anastasia was really feeling, during her time with Christian. It was a lot more define and clear in the book, because we understood, what kinky stuff, she was passive for, and what she wasn't. It's hard to figure out, here, because the sex was too tame and similar. One minute, she's having an organism, and then she's having fears for her safety. What? It doesn't help that most of the dialogue that they were feeding her, are very confusing, convolute, inconsistent or hypocritical. She says, she love Grey even though there are hardly anything that justifies it. She barely knows him. She has been told over and over again that Grey doesn't do romance, yet she's forcing herself to do this, for reasons, that are never explained. I guess, it's there to show, now na√Øve and inexperience; young women are, when it comes to love, but it comes across as too annoying childish for a serious adult melodrama. I really don't hold it, against Dakota Johnson's acting, because that felt more to the writers faults for not fleshing out their characters more. Johnson actually makes the whole thing pretty bearable thanks to her coy sense of humor. Even during the handful of serious parts, she really sells her character's innocence and struggle. Meanwhile, Jamie Dornan as Grey is just awful with his wooden delivery. Honestly, he's the weaker of the two leads. Due to the movie portraying him as a mysterious complex person, we don't really see any good redeeming likable qualities with his character, besides Grey's money and his looks. It's feels odd, for Anastasia to have feeling for him, because his cons really out-weight his pros. She really have to blindfold, to not see the mentally unstable, stalkerish, and manipulative, that he's putting out. He's almost rife with misogyny. The connection between the two seem too much of a fantasy. It didn't help that both actors, had little to no chemistry with each other, both in the sex scenes and their dialogue exchanges. Both looks very uncomfortable. Simply put, romantic leads, Johnson and Dornan do not like each other. The movie sex scenes were lame, compare to the edgy nature of the novel. The film, tease the audience, with all the weird things in the red room, but all you see, is nearly normal sex. The film tones down or removes most of the creepier parts of the book, including the infamous ""tampon scene"" to get an R rating than an X rating. I don't know if that it was the wisest decision. While, yes, it makes the audience more comfortable, watching the film; it also makes the movie, a bit safe and dull. Nothing, they did was really that strange. This movie does an incredibly poor job of portraying BDSM culture. The film also a bit sexism, when it comes to nudity. Clearly, this movie is made for women, and there is barely any male nudity. Dakota Johnson does all full frontal and it's Rated R, but if the man does it, it's turn into a rated X movie. Very odd. While, the sex scenes are nothing to look at. The way, how the rest of the movie was shot was beautiful. This is one of the highlights of the film, besides the use of establish songs as background music. While, the book and movie seem silly at first glance, it does have a somewhat harmful message that the studios is willing to mislead the audiences for, for money. The movie acts like a romance movie, when in truth, it's a movie with a lot of abuse. Why would anybody fantasize being in extremely emotionally abuse relationship like this? It's odd that many of older woman's fantasy is a book that demeans women. Overall: This movie is pretty awful. Don't recommended, watching. This is 50 Shades of not okay."

","After hearing all the hype about the book series I decided to see what all the buzz was about. I am not going to lie the writing was very confusing and sometimes not the best, but the story line is what got me hooked. This book is not about abuse, even though many non-readers will disagree. Everything in that happens in the book is consensual between the two characters. They both have an understand of what each other expects from the other. Christian Grey had a traumatic past and that is what shaped him to be what he is now, with the help of Elena. He is no abuser or does he intend to hurt women in the abuse sort of context. The point of the whole series is a person changing for the other, not because they are forced, but because they love one another. Ana and Christian have to learn about what pleases the other more to make it work. <br/><br/>Enough with the book, I think the movie did a pretty accurate job depicting the storyline. Of course many individuals did not take a particular liking to the book. I think that the director did a great job of making the sexual scenes very tasteful and did not blow them out of proportion. It is hard to make a movie out a book that features such sexual material, but Sam prevailed. Jamie Dornan had a difficult task of becoming Christian Grey, but he perfected it. He came off as very seductive and charming throughout the film. His performance on the interview scene was very convincing. Dakota Johnson wowed me with the part of Ana. She perfected the whole innocent act and made me believe that she really liked Dornan's character. The drunken call scene was a perfect addition to the movie and made have a couple laughs. The overall soundtrack went amazing with the movie. It made me feel each scene and in turn made the movie flow together. The locations where the film was shot were very realistic and believable compared to the book. It truly made the pages come to life. <br/><br/>I believe that you will have more appreciation of the movie once you read the book. It allows to compare and contrast the scenes. On contrary to all the negative reviews/critics, I am a fan of both the movie and book."
"irenebog","2","5","10","25 February 2015"," Zero eroticism
","OK, let's be honest. Everyone who had read the book (myself included) knew that it wasn't the most amazing piece of literature. The story has been told a million times in all the possible versions, the only new thing and the reason it got so much attention, was the ""singularity"" of the sex scenes. Now, that was the book. When you move to the screen however, you know that it's not possible to reproduce the effect of the book- as most of the book consists of Anastasia's thoughts and feelings- and of course it wouldn't be possible to depict what is described in the book. So, what I expected to watch - after so much waiting and speculation about the cast- was at least chemistry and tension between Johnson and Dornan. But there wasn't such a thing. Not even the slightest amount of it. The first thirty minutes of the film I was waiting to see magic happen, well it didn't. The rest of the film I just felt uneasy- that's the only sentiment communicated by the actors. It is definitely not worth watching.The acting is indifferent and falls flat. The only element of the film that lived up to my expectations was the soundtrack other than that, I don't think that it even remotely deserves to be called a ""romantic"" drama."

","This movie has motivated me to register at this web page. The movie is just nothing. There is no truly emotionally developing story in it or sexuality. I personally got annoyed and irritated by Anna's non stop biting lip and breasts. It feels like movie consisted of these two elements interleaved by some action. The scene of her ""first sex"" did not differ much from any other ""sex"" scene in the movie. And not like I am demanding porno, it would certainly possible to express the excitement and passion much better, even without constantly showing her boobs (which are not even that great). After this movie all I wanted is to visit Seattle."

They cut out the relationship between Jose and Ana which didn't take anything really away either and obviously trimmed down the sex - a lot - but they had to fit the whole book into a two hour movie and keep it in a rating where the audience would be more widely spread.<br/><br/>If your a lover of a good love story then this is a must to see."

","50 Shades is known for the ""sex"", but it actually has a good storyline. I enjoyed the way the movie was ""cleaned up"" so that the story shined brighter than the sex scenes. Speaking of sex scenes, I thought they were done tastefully (considering this movie was based on an erotic novel.) I've seen MUCH worse on the big screen....i.e. Unfaithful starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane and more recently Addicted starring Boris Kadjoe and Sharon Little. I have to admit that I was very disappointed when they cast Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele, but I WAS WRONG!!! They did a great job! After seeing Dakota Johnson and hearing her voice in the film, she was the perfect pick for Ana....she looked and SOUNDED so sweet and innocent. WELL DONE! I can't wait for the sequels"

","I didn't know what to expect, after reading the books, and negative reviews. This is the first movie review I've written in my 48 years, but I felt the need to come to it's defense somewhat. I felt it was more a love story, than soft porn, as some suggest. The people who have read all three books are the only ones who can understand why Christian has this dark side. Those who have not, should not be so quick to judge the ""type of movie"" this is. (there are far more explicit series on cable like Game of Thrones). I was also skeptical of the actors and if they could portray the characters well....I was NOT disappointed, in fact quite the opposite. I felt the steaminess from their first encounter. From her sweet voice, you feel her innocence....from his intense eyes and stern brow, you feel his seriousness...all the way through the movie. There is some comedy to lighten the mood, just when it's needed. There's just enough bedroom action to make it real without going too far. Well done! And I give it 9 out of 10, not because it's the best movie I've ever seen, but because it's exactly what I envisioned from the book. This is one that DID live up to the book."

I did not go to the film for a cultural experience, I went for fun and it lived up to my expectations. It is a film from a woman's perspective. I think that maybe some of the official critics are not the target audience and therefore probably had a pre-conceived idea that they would not like the film and therefore regarded the film with disdain. The sex was dealt with and portrayed very tastefully and not too much nor too little. There is even a reference to Jamie Dornan's previous role as the Belfast Strangler, Paul Spector, when Dakota Johnson asks him if he is a serial killer. Enjoyable film"
"harpenfluit","3","5","10","15 February 2015"," Not that bad
","Yes, the story is a bit shallow, but this movie is better that the ratings suggest. I think it's partly caused by the 'taboo' subject. BDSM gives a lot of giggles and discomfort by many people. I heard it around me when I saw the movie with my sub. The acting is good. Especially the two main characters do an excellent job. The BDSM is for a vanilla movie in a good way shown. Many aspects are indeed how it works in the BDSM community, although some aspects are a bit over the top (contract), but it's the comic relief, the movie needs. The bindings were not always safe, but it's a movie, not an instruction manual. It's a pity the movie (and book I assume), suggests that a dominant, has a traumatized past. Well, that's not in the real world and most people choose the lifestyle , because they simply like it. Overall nice movie, good acting, it's a nice chick flick about a subject more people want to explore than they are willing to confess. ;)"

","I'm one of those people who have read ALL three of the books, and yes, Chris is abusive but if you all were to actually READ THE SERIES you would see that, oh my gosh, after the first book he stops. I won't say any more but before you judge, read the books. If you were to actually read them, you would figure out 1) Why he is the way he is and 2) That he changes! Yes, I agree, I was shocked and slightly horrified as well but I actually read the series and now believe I have the right to say: Christian Grey is not that bad! He only hits her twice, and, sadly, she asked for it that last time. After that last beating, he never touches her like that AGAIN, EVER (unless she wants him to and in the books she enjoys getting spanked). So, before you start complaining, read the books. The people who have would know that the abuse stops after she leaves him (they do get back together) and when you learn why he is the way he is (the brief scene in the movie doesn't even start to explain it) you would realize that he is ""Fifty shades of f****d up"" for a reason."

","I don't see why so many people hated this movie. I loved it. I read the book a few years back and I hated it. I was scared I would hate the movie too but I fell in love. I have watched it so many times already and can't get enough. Just open your mind and you will enjoy it. If you are sensitive to the subject of sex or pain, obviously don't watch it. Jamie Dornan is already a great actor so I wasn't worried about how good Mr. Grey would be. I had never seen Dakota Johnson before so I had nothing to base it off of. But she was good. I'm confused as to why people say the actors sucked. Sure there was a scene at one point that was a little bad but oh well. Still loved it. But all in all, it's my new favorite movie.

","This movie was an eyeopner.<br/><br/>I've heard a lot about it but wasn't interested at all for serveral reasons. I haven't read the book... Yet. But it will be done after seeing this film. I normally prefers documentaries when reading & fiction of this kind isn't normally my cup of coffee, literally speaking. Well, the rumors predicted (in my opinion) a camouflaged pornmovie with the urge need to shock & utterly bind the audience with dire perversions. I was way wrong.<br/><br/>Instead of being a shallow tale about perverse fantasies, it was a recall about differences between extremes & had a virtuously political announcement.The two hours that passed during the first glance felt like 30 min which made me watch the movie directly afterwards for another round. I cannot deny the tensity & the subconscious effect that the characters sumbit.<br/><br/>When I read the negative comments about the this movie I feel confused... I'm uncertain of their expectations but it is an abomination to reject this creation as a faulty creation.<br/><br/>The thresholds between dominance & naivety is tastefully described. I for instance, is very dominant in my daily professional situation but partially submissive when it comes to interaction with my family. Which means that I'm susceptible to commands even though I daily give other persons the same treatment.<br/><br/>This movie was/is a refreshing relief that give different sides of a coin. I absolutely loved it!<br/><br/>I must admit, it had a few flaws but still it gave me a reason to affirm the differences of Grey & Steele & their portraits were/are breathtaking. I think that Dakota Johnsons version of the naive Anastasia is perfect & Jamie Dornans Christian Grey-improvisation is adjacent.<br/><br/>A quick conflusion: I usually don't like movies based on Fine literated tales. I don't like superficial creations that where made for the mainstream but this was different.<br/><br/>It is harsh, direct & naked.<br/><br/>I love every second of this film!

","I inhaled the books the first time although I didn't like everything about them ( the way they were written, certain unnecessary scenes etc. ). So I am a fan, but I'm still critical. What people forget is that this is fiction and not a documentary. It's fan fiction of twilight and nobody believes vampires are real now either do they? Furthermore I really think they did a great job at turning such a book into a movie. All in all I really enjoyed the movie. Probably because I laughed the first half of it. Most of the things in the movie seem awkward and funny, but it seemed to me like they meant it that way. It was kinda cute and I really enjoyed Dakotas performance. The sex scenes were steamy enough, I wasn't interested in watching porn. I think most people who enjoyed the books will like the movie as well unless they're easily manipulated by mainstream opinions of over sensitive people. Keep in mind, that some things spoken out loud are VERY different than when you read them in your head. I had fun, and I'd watch it again."
"osbornb","8","6","13","19 February 2015"," You need to know BDSM before judging so harshly
","First, I'll begin by saying, if you don't understand the world of BDSM then you're probably less likely to get what Fifty Shades of Grey is really about. Second, if you didn't read the novels, that's another hit against you, and why your probably not grasping what this story is truly about. There's a reason why the heat and chemistry between Doran (Christian Grey) and Johnson (Anastasia Steele) isn't completely developed as of yet, it's not a romantic film, not right now. It's about f'king and that's what Christian Grey and has made that perfectly clear to Ana and to the audience watching the film, that he's not the romantic kind of man in any sense but that Anastasia is changing him. It's because Grey has never had a relationship with a woman, a romantic relationship that is. He doesn't abuse woman in any sense either. All of the women Christian has had a relationship with sign a contract stating that it is okay for him to do the things he does in being his submissive. Otherwise he would never lay a finger on these women if they weren't in the least OK with it. These masochistic women want Dorans character to treat them like that, to hit them, spank them, whip them, do as they are told and if not then they are punished by Christian. That's the whole BDSM sexual desires and way's of the BDSM environment. If your looking for romance, then stick with Jane Austin and movies such as the Notebook and steer clear of Fifty Shades if this isn't the type of sex you want or even fantasize about.<br/><br/>Christian is guarded and shield's his heart because of his childhood and doesn't know what it's like to have a real romantic relationship with a female, until he meets Ana. <br/><br/>Johnson did great playing the innocent, shy and introverted Anastasia Steele and Doran caught my eye when I watch the Netflix series, ""The Fall."" He's got this intense charisma about him that just makes me wet. I like a man who can take control and he gives you the feeling of wanting to bend your ways to him and let him into you, completely. <br/><br/>I didn't care for the actress who plays Kate (she was just kind of dead weight and I think the producers really didn't put a whole lot thought into casting some of the supporting roles for this film, they could have done a lot better in that sense. But over all I liked it, since I have experienced BDSM before it's not forced in anyway, it's a mutual relationship between two people, who are willing and whom are okay performing these acts together. People need to realize that this isn't in anyway shape or form abuse against women. So, STOP already with the liberalism abuse against women bs. That's why there's always a contract involved, so no one gets hurt or can turn around and sue the other individual performing the sexual acts.<br/><br/>I hope that in the next film for Fifty Shades Darker, there's a but more intensity and charisma between Doran and Johnson, things need to start heating up in the second one or it will fall flat on it's face. Too bad Dorans married in life, because it might benefit the movie if Johnson and Doran developed a relationship outside of Fifty and really got things heating up on and off camera."
"alrightbecs","1","6","13","18 February 2015"," 50 Shades of Disappointment
","As an erotica fan, I find this movie insulting.<br/><br/>Despite the book's literary shortcomings, the plot isn't that dreadful. However, in this movie the majority of the plot was abandoned. Having taken into account that producers would have to shorten the plot, they seem to have compressed it down by only, of course, using the 'saucy' parts. This may be what viewers have gone for, but the build up towards it has been taken out almost completely, which makes it hard to follow, and instantly makes the story less important and meaningful. It removes the romance and takes away what motive E. L. James decided to write the novel on.<br/><br/>If I could've given this title 0/10 I would've. I guess the only thing I can offer with this one star is the soundtrack. Despite Elle Goulding's awful song."
"ella-masen28","1","6","13","17 February 2015"," Disgusting
","So obvious to the audience that it is just a brushed of version of a 'Twilight' FanFiction. Just like 'Twilight' it portrays an abusive relationship, that for some reason people are going crazy over.<br/><br/>Why anyone would want to watch the glorification of an abusive relationship is beyond me. The film degrades BDSM by not showing an accurate portrayal of what a BDSM relationship is actually like. Christian is not a Dom. There are countless times when he ignores Ana's requests to stop, or doesn't respect her boundaries. He also stalks her, like all the time.<br/><br/>50 Shades also degrades women. It teaches people that when a woman says ""no"", it's okay for you to carry on. As if we don't have enough trouble having people believe women in our rape culture. I really feel for women who have had to live through abuse, such as the stuff shown in 50 shades, and then see their misery and pain blasted all over the media and portrayed as ""romantic."""

","""""You'd kidnap me?"" ""Oh yes,"" he grins. ""Hold me against my will?"" Jeez this is hot."" - Definitely not rape, from 50 shades of grey.<br/><br/>the 50 shades of grey movie was much less painful to experience than reading the horribly written, edited, and disturbing novel. This movie doesn't even extend into the ""Cult Classic"" category with it's nightmarish acting, horrific dialogue, and warped concept that offends the BDSM culture itself!<br/><br/>""He reaches between my legs and pulls on the blue string¬Ö what! And¬Ö a gently pulls my tampon out and tosses it into the nearby toilet. Holy (bleep). Sweet mother of all¬Ö Jeez. And then he's inside me¬Ö ah!"" - True love, from 50 shades of grey.<br/><br/>Acting: 1/10 - There's a lot of things that you can tell about a movie from the actors. During many interviews, Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan express contempt for one another (if not the film itself). This followed into the movie. The acting seems almost robotic, lacking in personality.<br/><br/>The gooey sexual content: 1/10 - Porn was never meant for mainstream theaters. This is another example on why. The book ventures into bizarre forms of paraphilia and gender abuse that readers can't seem to get enough of. While many were making their pants moist, or pitching a tent for the tampon scene, the film had to be heavily edited from the ""Fifty shades of sexual abuse"" guide, in order for it to enter into theaters.<br/><br/>The atmosphere: 6/10 - The atmosphere along with the camera editing did indeed help make it slightly more tolerable. But what it didn't do, was keeping the men in the audience from laughing, saying ""This is just diluted porn"" to get up and walk away, or keep the women from sneaking out of the theater, hoping that nobody saw that they paid for it.<br/><br/>Overall: 1/10 - Porn is porn, whether we want to acknowledge it or not. There are many websites of men taking advantage of women and beating them while the woman says ""More please"" if that's what you're into. Attempting to add a storyline to porn doesn't often turn out well, and this goes double when you edit said porn and put it in mainstream media. This movie holds no stable plot to satisfy those who are seeking a good story, and it's offensive to women enough to spawn boycotting campaigns, it's offensive to the BDSM culture because it depicts a practitioner as being someone who takes advantage of their partner, and ultimately, there is absolutely no saving grace for this movie other than the tampon scene not being added. This movie holds no comedic value to compensate for its horrible performance in the sense that ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" does, and it holds no strong plot, storyline, or acting for it to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>""Next time you'll be in the cargo hold, bound and gagged in a crate."" -50 shades of grey<br/><br/>This movie will stand strong as being one of the largest money-makers this year, but its performance score will remain below the Spongebob Movie.<br/><br/>Don't torment yourself by watching this movie, and don't give someone who gets work inspired by twilight your money. God Speed, ladies and gentlemen."

","I've already seen the movie twice now, and to be honest, the first time I actually was a little disappointed, or you know the books are always better, but when I saw it the second time, I began to understand it a little bit better and realized I actually liked it. It IS a bit like what's in the book and a lot funnier. Honestly, I like Ana a lot better in the movie than in the books, and think both Jamie and Dakota (also Eloise as Kate, 'cause she's cool and awesome) fits perfectly for the role as Christian and Ana. <br/><br/>Of course, it's almost funny to see fifty shades of Grey coming alive into a movie. The book is very intense and it's difficult to make a movie as intense as the book. That's the only thing that I feel is missing in the movie. There IS a lot of things that's been cut out, but yeah, I'm satisfied anyway!<br/><br/>The thing is, I've read a lot of the reviews just now and think there's a lot of people who's expecting too much of the movie, and the ratings' an understatement. I mean, i've seen like 20 review's in a row who has rated the movie 1 star. Of course, it's your own opinion, but there is a lot more to the story in this movie (and book) if you really look into it. I think it would be soo much better when there's a sequel, because then the people will get to understand more of the story of Christian for instance. His past, his story, his reason for why he is like he is.<br/><br/>Sequel, FIFTY SHADES OF DARKER? I hated the end, because I wanted to see more. I DO know what happens next, but I want to see it, and it's just a sudden end, like whaaaat, why is this happening? It ended so quick and I was really sad at the end. I really hope for a sequel. If the ratings are bad right now, I do know the ratings will fly up to the sky when the sequel's out, 'cause the first movie will then make more sense. Unless you've read the books. But I've read the book and I think it's amazing. <br/><br/>The movie deserves more credit then the movie is given. At least my opinion."
"szn-1","2","6","13","16 February 2015"," The Screenwriter Killed the Essence of The Book.
","I didn't go in expecting an Academy Award winning movie, but after hearing how much EL James fought to keep the movie as close to the books, I was disappointed with what they came up with. No... didn't need more sex scenes, but definitely could have added another 1/2 hr to develop the storyline and other characters in the movie. Books were definitely much better. Movie cut out way too much that helped create and develop the emotional attachment and chemistry I felt while reading the books. Storyline was too disconnected and rushed, and some parts out of sequence from the book. Friendships Anastasia has between her friends and Christian's body guard weren't developed enough either. Plus they make his body guard just seem like a chauffeur in the movie.<br/><br/>If you didn't read the books, you wouldn't understand the significance of when he says ""Laters Baby"" and when she says ""Yes Sir"". For example, in the books, Christian & Anastasia ' s emails back and forth were written a bit more formal with subject lines that were fun and teasing each other back and forth. . And always signed off by Christian with ""Laters Baby"". Both big phrases that became key to the books so much that you could buy t-shirts and other stuff with the phrases on it after the books came out. But in the movie, they're just words that wouldn't make sense if you didn't read the books. Book one wasn't my favorite though. Boring compared to the other 2. So I'm hoping the next 2 movies will be better written and more connection with the characters.<br/><br/>Hopefully they will hire a screenwriter & director who read all the books and knows what needs to be left in the story line."

Those who have considered devoting a VIP ticket for this film - please reconsider. your wallet will be angry with you. 3.Those of you who have left the theater with an odd feeling you've already seen it before somewhere - you are not alone! 4. Clause 3 explained - Ask any shrilly teenager to name that movie: A rich stud, tormented by a secret, falls inexplicably for an average, dazed girl, whose selfish mother neglected her and puts her own interests before her daughter's. The girl is baffled by this Greek God's interest in her, and (rightfully) feels unworthy. Being very protective and flirtatious on the one hand, but telling her she should stay away from him on the other, the girl is very much confused by these mixed signals. The girl, so smitten with his Adonis looks and charisma, is willing to take on whatever crap he is about to lay on her, just so he would be with her. Oh, and there are also some sucking, but of a different kind. ANY GUESSES? 200 points for the righteous winner! 5. I know, I know. E L James has never hidden the fact that her book is an erotic adaptation of *that saga will shall not speak its name*, but for the love of God, do we really have to see it twice? only with the addition of nudity and lots of sex?! 6. It is beyond me how a book written by a woman, a screenplay written by a woman and a movie directed by a woman turned out to be no more than a sleazy B class soft porn intended, solely for the pleasure of male viewers!! Gee, thanks a million dearest MPAA, for letting me sit through more than half of the film watching Dakota Johnson's 13-year-old-boy, nude, unshaven body, while showing none of Jamie Dornan's ""assets"". That was exactly what I envisioned and hoped for!! 7. For those of you who are still considering watching it, keep in mind: IMDb rated this movie at 3.8 ...

There wasn't even a point to her being tied aside from ""oooh look at our edgy, kinky sex"". But it wasn't. It was pretending to be.

"lalor_151","4","6","13","13 February 2015"," Movie was satisfying, but I was left disappointed.
","I am a die hard fan of the Fifty Shades trilogy having read each book 3 times, so as expected I could not wait to see the first instalment of the trilogy as a film. One word to explain how I felt after watching the movie is... satisfied. Yes, I just felt satisfied. This disappointed me because I was expecting amazing things out of this movie and didn't even come to close to feeling the way I did when I read the Fifty Shades of Grey book... maybe going in to the movie my expectations were too high. Here is a brief summary of all my thoughts.. (not going to lie couldn't wait to get this out of my system)<br/><br/>To begin with, the movie did not live up to the hype and energy executed by the trailer. If I'm too be brutally honest, I enjoyed the experience of watching the trailer more than the film itself. Jamie Dornan was not what I had in mind as Christian Grey, and sorry to be using this word so many times, he was just satisfying. Physically I think he suited the role of the aesthetic Christian Grey quite well, but emotionally he did not do much for me. I know that Christian is an emotionless prick but still there is a beautiful richness to his character thats delivered so perfectly in the book. That intensity and fire that embodies Christian Grey was not delivered on the screen. The control that he exudes and his dominance over Ana blinded by his love for her was emitted from the movie and a major let down for me and the character of Mr Grey. And more importantly the way he begins to slowly fall in love with Ana throughout the book was not made obvious at all in the movie. This is what I loved about the book and the whole trilogy- the progression of his love for her- shock horror no, I did not read the book because of the kinky sex. Sadly, if you have not read the book and just watch the movie, I don't blame you if you think it's just a porno. I PROMISE YOU ITS SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT! <br/><br/>To be honest Jamie Dornan's acting was mediocre. And someone please explain to me what the hell was up with his accent! The American accent was so off, and made him awkward to watch. <br/><br/>On a lighter note, Dakota Johnson both played and fit the role of Anastasia Steele beautifully. She was exactly what I had pictured in my head. She was not a let down, her acting partner was. The scenery exhibited in the movie was amazing! Greys apartment and play room was spot on! And as so many have raved by now, the movie surprisingly was very funny. I never laughed once whilst reading the book so I must admit that was a pleasant change. If anything the play room scenes were exhibited the best. Done tastefully, evoking that thrill and anxious anticipation within in the audience, without scaring them away, But lets be real- the best thing that came out of the movie was the soundtrack- Ellie Goulding, The Weekend and Queen B were ahmazing.<br/><br/>If there's one piece of advice i can give to all those that have not yet watched the movie and are going to..... PLEASE READ THE BOOK BEFOREHAND...BOOKS 2 AND 3 T00 ! You still will probably be disappointed with the film, but will appreciate the story and the book for the good piece of writing it is."

I cannot wait until further movies are released so it is all revealed. The chemistry of Anna and Christian works well on screen. The scenes are believable and you are kept wondering of what happens next. Although BDSM is glamourized in this movie, it is a reality of what happens in some relationships where there is a dominant and a submissive involved.The movie is straightforward throughout with no long unnecessary scenes so it kept me entertained.I am not sure why this movie has had such negative reviews, perhaps people do not really want to ""like"" something that has been so popular so they choose to oppose the trend."

It's the same love story that has been favored by female readers for centuries in a way or other. From Cinderella, to Beauty and the beast. This fantasy of taming a not approachable man with your love. Unrealistic and unhealthy as this is, those kind of books bring the kind of drama that keep some people turning the pages. I thought the concept even if not original had potential. No inner goddess, no holy cow, no graphic scenes (because they wanted to stick to an R rating) no repetitive scenes, and you could end up with a decent story. Add that to Nowhere Boy director, a Danny Elfman score, and a visually appealing setting and I thought the movie could be one of those cases in which the movie is better than the book. The book is more character driven than plot driven so I wasn't going to complain about the lack of a beginning a climax and an ending.<br/><br/>Well, I was wrong. The movie is not as bad as I thought it could be but Kelly Marcel lost a great opportunity to get rid of the horrible dialog. One thing is Reading ridiculous lines like ""I don't make love I f*** hard"" ""I'm going to f** you into next week"" ""What have you done to me?"" and another seeing them in the big screen. Ridiculous! Everybody knows that EL James is not the best writer and she wrote this piece for fun but I thought the scriptwriter would have a Little bit of respect for her reputation and try to get her name attached to a decent script. I know that giving the nature of the material she couldn't do much but still, something could've been done at the scrip department.<br/><br/>Besides I thought that the whole point of the story is that these couple who are very different from each other, who don't know how to have a healthy relationship, who try to get what they want through manipulation were slowly falling in love. Nothing that I saw in the movie made me feel they were really into each other. Part is that the actors have no chemistry but also that the script gives them little to no room to create characters that convincingly convey how much they are into each other. Scenes that were supposed to be romantic (yes romantic, because disturbed people like Christian fall in love too) turned out to look cheesy or creepy.<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality of these two is how they fall into each other but Kelly Marcel seems to have been more interested in presenting sex scenes. There are plenty and they are not particularly graphic but with the exception of a couple of sex scenes outside the Red room the rest is just...meh! I felt like they were there just trying to say, ""look we are presenting sex scenes in an artistic way!"" <br/><br/>Also I can't believe I'm going to say this but Christian Grey in the book I can totally understand and is better written. He was hurt, had certain vulnerability, he was a good mix of arrogance, Jack-ass attitude and mystery. Kelly Marcel and Sam Taylor didn't bother to give him more background, more sass, a hook for the viewers to understand why Anastasia was drawn to this man. It looked like she was after the money because other than that, what else is there to draw an intelligent manipulative college graduate into a world she doesn't like?<br/><br/>Talking about the sex scenes. It was really necessary to insert a pop-song in each of them? Danny Elffman's score is one of the few redeeming qualities of the movie and you get distracted by the pop songs.<br/><br/>I thought that Sam Taylor Johnson had good intentions with this film.The scene in which Ana and Christian are discussing the soft and hard limits was brilliant. Besides she inserts some themes here, some themes there. Those themes are part of the book but the sub-par prose doesn't let you appreciate them. Kudos to that but she missed the opportunity of making this movie more Secretary and less twilight.<br/><br/>Dakota Johnson's Acting is decent and in certain scenes she displays a strength that Anastasia didn't have in the books. She's very expressive and carries the movie well. I think her performance is another redeeming quality of this train-wreck. A lot of book readers are always claiming how Anatasia is easy manipulated but I think any woman who wants to change a man for whatever reason has a tendency to manipulation, too. That's not unconditional love. If you love some one take him for what he is and if he is not what you're looking for leave. But if you stay it's because you're as damaged, controlling and manipulative as he is. Dakota plays this woman who tries to turn a disturbed guy into her prince charming quite decently.<br/><br/>Dornan's casting was a huge mistake. His horrible performance reinforces this idea that the only reason Ana is after him is his looks and his money because he gives nothing sexy, interesting, intriguing, magnetic about his character. People who haven't read the book would be wondering why so many women fell in love with Christian Grey. If Charlie Hunnam (who I think could have saved this movie from the disaster it became) wasn't available they should have postponed filming till they found a guy who could portray the role. I've seen Dornan act in the fall and he's not good but he isn't as bad as he is here. <br/><br/>So overall I'm glad I didn't pay to see this movie but saw it in an advanced screening."

Considering all he thinks about is sex all fricken day. They don't really elaborate on his intelligence and wit that help him create the business he owns. They could've done that in 5 minutes but whatever.<br/><br/>Ok so let's focus on what the main story is about. The girl they picked for the story is the. absolute. WORST.

"Pheeke","5","3","5","11 May 2016"," It's kinda vanilla.
","This movie wasn't at all as bad as people make it out to be. It's kinda vanilla, not very kinky.<br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey is about a young literature student named Anastasia Steele. She meets a handsome billionaire for an interview called Christian Grey. They start a romance that is complicated by his sexual desires.<br/><br/>They made this movie out to be very kinky and it's not. It's a bit erotic but mainly I thought it was unintentionally funny. The dialogue and delivery makes it look more like a spoof than an actual movie. I loved the scene where they discuss the contract, that was very funny (and i think it was actually meant to be) if the rest of the movie was written that cleverly this would be a fun erotic romantic-comedy. Dakota Johnson isn't awful or anything but she's given very little to work with. Her character Anastasia Steele (her name alone) is so forced and just not a real human being. Jaimie Dornan as Christian Grey has even less development, he's a bit boring. Seeing as this movie is made for a mainly female audience I didn't understand why we had to see Dakota Johnson naked so often and Grey barely, that just doesn't seem fair to us girls.<br/><br/>I think that if you go into this movie with a bottle of wine expecting to laugh at the cringe- worthy dialogue, you could enjoy it.

","Frankly, I'm not sure that there is a rating low enough to accurately describe Fifty Shades of Grey. Universal Pictures and Focus Features, along with producers Michael De Luca and Dana Brunetti took E.L. James' badly written book series and made them into bad movies. <br/><br/>The only reason that Fifty Shades of Grey gained the amount of attention and popularity that it did was because the subject matter is considered by the general public to be taboo. Taken as a whole, the books and films are a colossal insult to and a highly inaccurate of the entire BDSM community. <br/><br/>If Christian Grey were a real person, he would be shunned by the community.

","The plot is idiotic. An intelligent well educated college senior interview a handsome rich guy and falls for him. He is a nut case who does ""not make love. {He} f*cks, hard."" He also is a sadist. He won't let his women touch him. OK, maybe our co-ed likes that. Except that she is a virgin until she sleeps with this guy. She also has nothing in common with him. She is a romantic, he isn't. She likes to do things together, he doesn't. The two of them don't do anything together except have sex, don't talk about anything except how screwed up he is. What a deep and exciting relationship. Just the kind of guy an intelligent well-educated college senior would fall in love with. You betcha.<br/><br/>Our guy also has built some gigantic business empire even though he is only in his twenties. Recent examples of that are quite rare and involve people who produced new things, such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Not our guy. He says that business is based on knowing people, and he knows people. Apparently my more than 30 years of teaching in a business school was all misguided. I was under the impression, and taught others, that entrepreneurship, inventiveness, management skills, finance, risk assessment, and productivity were among the important things that determined business success. All irrelevant as long as you know people, it seems. The usual Hollywood stupidity about what business is, what business does, and how business works.<br/><br/>Our guy is more than just a business whiz. He has done it while overcoming a crack-head mother and an abusive childhood. He also plays classical piano brilliantly. He flies a helicopter and also glider planes. He's tough as nails in his business dealings, but under it all he has a heart of gold, giving tons of money to noble charities. One hackneyed angle after another.<br/><br/>Now about the sex scenes. Plenty of nudity and some SM. When you strip out the Hollywood crap and phony baloney garbage, what you have is the core of the movie - simple SM pornography, though actually not much of it. What's this junk doing getting ratings on IMDb? Does IMDb also rate stag films and Hollywood starlets' sex tapes? If it rates this pile of dung, why not those, or to turn that around, if not those, then why this?<br/><br/>The ending isn't really an ending. It leaves the relationship between our hero (?) and heroine (?) hanging and is an obvious come-on for a sequel, of which I understand there are to be two. The development of those is obvious from the story line in this one. The basic line will be that our hero will be tormented by his love for our heroine, and in the end she will re-make him and save him from himself. An SM-porn version of Pretty Woman, I guess, stretched out into three installments. Sounds awful. This one sure was."

","I have the impression that I must be too much of a romantic type woman with a strong character - I can see myself in Anastascia in some ways. I believe moviegoers are watching this film based on the big talk about sadism and sex scenes. These things do exist in the world and must be discussed and even shown. No one seems to see that this is a beautiful love story, in which the WOMAN is the dominant character and na√Øve as she may be, intelligent and mainly in love, she changes a relationship from what he requires and learns from her. With her denials, he suffers and sees how wrong he has been and finds out he has NEVER been in love before. The sex he was so proud of performing was ill, sickening. So much so that he hid it from his own family - he was ashamed. He knew he was sick. He knew he was a loser. But love is more powerful. I do think that in the written trilogy, sex could have been cut out a lot and that the author could have possibly more deeply developed the beautiful love the couple experienced. And talking about the actors, Dakota and Jamie's chemistry was just it - a perfect couple. Congratulations chiefly to Sam Taylor-Johnson, a truly intelligent woman and extraordinary director. Her expertise, savoir faire and understanding of what was endeavored, will be missed in the next two films. many people must think the way I do. look at the box office and the instant projection of the actors. it was just not only sex... just my personal thoughts..."

"Horst_In_Translation","4","3","5","21 January 2016"," Better than expected
","You can probably see what my expectations were like for this movie when I give my review such a title and rate it only 2 out of 5. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is a pretty controversial film from earlier this year that was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson (""Nowhere Boy"") and the base material was adapted by Kelly Marcel (""Saving Mr. Banks""). So there is some talent included here and without having read the book, I am fairly certain that they did the best with E.L. James' material that they could. Casting decisions are okay too. There is actually an Oscar winner in here (Marcia Gay Harden) and the two leads are pretty attractive and also not too bad on the acting front. For Dakota Johnson it may be in the genes looking at who her parents are.<br/><br/>The story is about a young woman that discovers her sexuality slowly when she runs into a billionaire, whose preferences are somewhat different from the norm. There are a couple cringeworthy moments here, for example that she has to be a virgin, but all in all, it's not a complete failure what it could have been too given the material. The main theme of the film is discovering their own and their partner's sexual identity. Unfortunately, from that perspective it is not really working. The characters' actions are just too wishy-washy and completely change in an unrealistic manner during several sequences of the film. Sometimes she is totally into his stuff, then the exact opposite. He says he is not a romantic and yet he does some romantic stuff on several occasions of the film. There were several parts where it just didn't make sense.<br/><br/>So yeah, maybe this is a pretty good watch if you are horny or if you have tendencies that resemble the ones from the characters in the film when it comes to your sex-life, but other than that, it is not a particularly good watch and also way too long and occasionally dragging at almost 2 hours and 10 minutes. The material is simply not deep enough for anything over 90 minutes in my opinion. I cannot recommend the watch and it is pretty ridiculous that there will apparently be at least 2 more movies. Talk about milking a dead cow. All for the box office success and I would be massively surprised if those sequels will be any better than this one here. Thumbs down. Also not big at all on the Oscar-nominated song. Pretty weak film all around."

The scene where she was in the bar was really hard to watch.<br/><br/>I felt like the creators of this movie were of the mentality that if they just add enough sex scenes in it and the cinematography is good, people will like it.

One of the worst endings i have seen in my life, seriously how did the people behind this movie decide to make the ending that way? This movie was anticipated to be extremely controversial and over the top in many ways, i for one did not witness any of those.<br/><br/>The premise was kind of interesting and the first half of the film was not as bad, i was actually thinking - wow, maybe this is not going to be as horrible as almost every reviewer here have deemed, unfortunately they were right and the second part and the ending just affirmed my low expectations for this movie. The biggest problem was that the movie did not ''grow'' as the time passed, it just stayed the same throughout, hence it wasn't enjoyable. Also the songs and soundtracks chosen for various scenes were just horrible and didn't fit at all with what was happening at the time.<br/><br/>Some people dislike the movie, because, in their opinion, it is derogatory towards women and since it is a widely known mainstream movie it reaches out to many people, it could harm the relationships of men and women, ehh just some classic feminist ranting, i simply disliked this film, since everything was off as i stated above and i did not find this controversial or shocking in any way. The only emotion i had during this film was boredom, because of its linear plot and slow pace.<br/><br/>I only wanted to watch this, because from what i had heard, the over-whelming majority of women really liked it, however the majority of men i know thought it was thrash. In my opinion, this is due to the fact that women really enjoyed seeing a normal woman being put on a ''pedestal'' by a very wealthy and handsome young man, who can give her everything in exchange for sexual pleasure, despite that casual women don't usually like bdsm, they were ready to put that aside just to care for the sad and love seeking woman. Men on the other hand, although, on paper this should be a movie most men would love, disliked it, because it just did not meet their expectations, just like it was in my case. Lets get real for a second. Nobody wants to sit through two hours of nothingness just see a couple of poorly thought through sex scenes, which were promised to be super controversial. Men just rather watch regular porn, i would get if it would have something else to, interesting plot, etc., but unfortunately there was just that.<br/><br/>Is worth watching it? No."

"sarah-haverty","9","3","5","13 March 2015"," Surprised at the low ratings- I went into this movie blind!
","Warning- contains spoilers<br/><br/>First off, this movie brings up a controversial and touchy subject, which I will comment on later, I was not expecting anything like bdsm to come up, however. Jamie Dornen is hot and I like him as an actor, I could detect his accent, but for me, I didn't think it took away from the film (besides, the character Chistian was adopted and from where, no one said). However, I do agree with some of the comments made about Dakota Johnson. I would've expected a woman with some curves, someone resembling Scarlett Johansson. I did think that Dakota's acting was decent, contrary to what I've been reading in reviews. Her character was not comfortable with sadism, and the actress also seemed uncomfortable- I thought it was a good fit. I must admit, I didn't read the book, so my perspective might be lacking, but I thought the level of sadism the script went into was appropriate for this kind of media, going too far would be intense for unsuspecting viewers- movies are intended to be appealing to broad audiences for the most-part. To be completely honest, I was worried about where the movie might go, and I was not really that into it until the end, when she left him. The way the split was captured was breathtaking. After receiving his worst, she left- to me it looked like she realized that she couldn't help him- that the pleasure he's able to get out of another's true pain is a sign. I also like how it was made clear that Christian was afraid of intimacy- of being touched, for example. I got the feeling that his sadism was a way to have a sort of intimacy without getting close to women. I can't speak for how the book ended, but I think the movie brings up a good topic with a good ending, especially since sadism and masochism are rising in popularity (or at least becoming more visible). S&M is not just another way of being, it is a damaged way of being. But I do think there is hope for recovery- though people have to save them selves (possibly get help). I've never been a fan, but I've noticed more conversation about these topics. There are ways of being 'abnormal' or divergent if one so chooses to be, without pain... Without dominance and unequal partnerships.... Overall, I liked this film, it gave me a lot to think about."

No- brainer. <br/><br/>I'll tell you right now, the book was better than the movie. But most books are.<br/><br/>I saw the movie, thoroughly enjoyed it! It was hot and the soundtrack was phenomenal! And hello! Two words: Jamie Dornan. He is gorgeous. The movie was silly and fun in parts which broke up the seriousness of the movie. Jamie played his part so beautifully! 'Christian' is a detached, broken, disconnected man, who thinks he can never be loved. That's exactly how he came across in the movie. 'Ana' is sweet, funny, unassuming, and loving. That's exactly how she came across in the movie.<br/><br/>This is a love story with some kink. Plain and simple. And Ana really is the one with ALL the power. If the critics read the books, they'd know this. E.L. James portrayed that so beautifully.<br/><br/>There will always be HATERS (critics) out there who think this book is nothing but abuse, beatings and promotes violence, even rape. What?? Have they actually read the books? Do they even know what BDSM is? Safe, sane, consensual is what those in the BDSM community promote. It's no different in this movie.<br/><br/>The ""show me how bad it can get"" at the end of the movie was difficult to watch, but! Nailed it. Christian is so conflicted between wanting to accept love and what he has been used to. It comes out beautifully in this part. So at the end, when he pushes her over her limit, he realizes that. But it's too late. She gets angry and leaves...thus, leading into the next installment, DARKER.<br/><br/>Okay, here's just a few little itty-bitty things I had an issue with, but not enough to lower my rating. The scenes seemed VERY rushed to me. The sex scenes were HOT, but they didn't have them talking like they did in the book. And that was when the connection was made between them. Especially Ana's first time. He spoke to her seductively, and it is when they actually made love. But it wasn't in the movie, so it lacked a bit of the intimate connection there. <br/><br/>Some of the scenes, such as when Ana went to visit her mom, were very rushed and some important things were left out. Meeting his family seemed rushed to me as well, IMO. I loved the texts. I wish they did more. And they will in the sequel. I hope.<br/><br/>What people need to remember is, this movie is an 'ADAPTATION' of the book. It's not going to be verbatim or it would've been a 4 and a 1/2 hour movie. It was hot, sensual, sexy, beautiful! And funny! Dakota is such a great actress. I wasn't surprised by how funny it was because once again, E.L. James has a sense of humor along with her wicked-awesome talent as a writer. <br/><br/>I'm shocked at all the low ratings from the critics. Obviously E.L. James knows what she is doing with over 100 mil copies sold. This story/movie is so different and refreshing!! <br/><br/>So if you've read the books but haven't seen the movie yet, I have a very good piece of advice for you. Go with an open mind. Wide open. Not any preconceived notions or expectations. I believe you won't be disappointed. <br/><br/>I cannot WAIT for the sequel."
"gintare-r","10","10","26","14 February 2015"," Absolutely loved it!
","I am not even sure, why the ratings are so low here for this movie, but I personally enjoyed it from the beginning till the end! Of course I was a bit disappointed that they couldn't put the whole book in one movie part, but what can I say, thats the movie business! Movie was intense, sexy and interesting (keep in mind that I haven't read the actual book)! Awesome movie! Cannot wait for the second part! Dakota Johnson acts great in this movie! Just added her to my lesbian crush list :) Story plot is awesome!Oh, and I absolutely love the soundtracks of this movie! Cannot stop listening , even after movie! Main actor is sexy enough to act for Mr Grey! Loved it and recommend to watch to all!"
"gatorprincess815","10","10","26","14 February 2015"," This movie was excellent, lived up to hype.
","I loved the movie. I thought Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan were excellent.I know the movie left off quite a bit from the book, but so do most movie adaptations. I thought the movie captured the spirit of the books well. The movie also added some things I wish had been in the book. The only think I wish they would have kept in was the silver balls. The sex scenes were OMG! so hot. <br/><br/>The thing about the movie that the movie didn't have was it added more layers to Christian Grey. Now the 2nd and 3rd books you have more layers to Christian, but you don't see it in the first book, but in the movie you see it. I think you have to give a lot of credit to the filmmakers for that, but also give kudos to Jamie Dornan for getting that across in his performance. His performance of Christian's vulnerabilities was understated, but there. I loved it, he is the perfect Christian Grey. <br/><br/>I have seen this movie twice. I loved it the first time, but I loved it even more on my second watch. If I could I would watch it a 3rd and 4th time. I can't wait for the sequels to get here. <br/><br/>I loved how they ended the movie leaving us wanting more but also doing it in how Ana and Christian first met with an elevator. Very well done Sam Taylor Johnson. <br/><br/>From forevermore Dakota and Jamie are my Christian and Ana."
"Rebecca-mendez2005","10","16","47","12 February 2015"," Fantasy-not a love story
","Dakota Johnson is amazing. Matched the expectations. Men should watch it to know what women need! Great cast. Nicely done Quite entertaining. It's a good escape from the boring routine day to day life especially when you work with bunch of weirdos at work. Fantasies are out of reach, that's what makes them so desirable. Good job Dakota No shame no regrets. I watched it to see how Hollywood did bringing the words in the novel to colours on screen. Nice job well done. The guy playing Christian couldn't really do the character justice. He is okay but Dakota is the perfect match. Will watch it again. But there's one problem. Have to wait a whole year for the darker version. And on the same note, Vancouver! Wake up! Next time when the Grey crew is herein our city make buzz about it. Tanw a break from being so serious. Life can be fun too. Good job Dakota."
"cheryluk","9","9","23","13 February 2015"," Like the movie as I love the book!
","People should stop complaining about the movie when they didn't even enjoy the book! I saw a lot people left a bad review of the movie when they just go with their female friends as a company before they read the book even they don't like the book. If you are just attracted from the trailer and want to see some sexual scene then don't go watch this movie, not even go as a company because the movie won't be what you are expected and you will feel the movie is killing you. I have read the book and I enjoy it so does the movie. The only thing I don't like is the movie story goes too fast, it will be better to have a bit longer, otherwise it looks like Ana fell in love with Chris only with one sight, but it actually takes longer than that for her to be attracted and I wish that they chose someone else than Jamie to be Christian Grey. I like the movie so those who haven't read the book and who didn't enjoy the book please stop complaining and don't watch it. If you didn't enjoy the book story, you won't enjoy the movie for sure, if you haven't read the book, the movie is too short to tell everything, so please read the book!"
"westfield-john","10","8","20","11 June 2015"," Filfy Shades of Nudity
","Did you know how different the shades of nudity can be in just one movie? Dakota Johnson tried an interesting approach with Fifty Shades of Grey. I've counted endless hours, and I'm still not finished. Sometimes soft, then in broad daylight, or in the pale smile of the ascending moon. It is so simple, and yet illustrative. I did not notice this before. Or would ever anyone think about the shades of the nipples of the woman sharing the same bed with you? Raising the blind, letting them down again, alternating the ambiance in room with the light regulator, just to take notice of the amazing shades? In fact, who does have a light regulator at all? I wonder what impact choco cream or mustard honey could have, under neath the leather stripes, bound and shackled, greasy and gross. OK, let me watch this movie again...until I'm satisfied. 10 out of 10 for this amazing replay value."
"kmelectrics","1","8","20","14 February 2015"," What a pile of rubbish
","I only gave the film a 1 star rating, as i can't give it no stars, unfortunately. The books were infinitely better than this mediocre rubbish, which begins with a warning of ""strong sex"" If the film had been intended as a comedy- it would have failed anyway; though the crowds of girls & women who found parts hysterically funny ( for no reason I could fathom, unless large quantities of alcohol had been imbibed first) ( which might be the best foreplay to watching this movie. The ""sex"" was tame to nonexistent, the characters, for the most part, were in-believable, and the script so generic it defied belief. When I read the first book, i HAD to follow up with the second, and then third, immediately.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the hype will only catch me once; I expect the next two films to flop dramatically, once the public know what they aren't going to get for their money. <br/><br/>Don't waste your time or money."

I have nothing more to say on the matter so I'm going to link this here so that people can educate themselves https://www.xeromag.com/fvbdsafety.html f you are going to play with bondage or spanking or resistance play or role-playing, it's often wise to establish a ""safeword,"" which is a code word that means 'Stop, now, I'm serious.' This word should be something you won't forget and that won't come up in any other way. Many people use ""Green-Yellow-Red:"" Green means ""everything's fine,"" Yellow means ""Don't stop, but don't do anything harder than that,"" Red means ""Stop everything right now."""

","Why anyone would spend anything to see this sicko film is beyond reason. Bondage is mental illness in action.<br/><br/>Sex between a loving man and and woman is great but this retarded film perverts it into something dark, scary and awful. <br/><br/>There have been romantic and erotic films made that deal with love and sex in a healthy positive way but this is not that kind of film. not even close. <br/><br/>And the perverts behind this mess release it on Valentine's Day - - that's really sick. <br/><br/>Looking for a great romantic film - try ""The Way We Were"", ""A Man and a Woman"", ""Ghost"", ""Blow-Up"", ""Romeo & Juliet""(both 1969 & 1996), ""Ever After"", ""When Harry Met Sally"", ""Splendor in the Grass"", Officer and a Gentleman""."

","Well, this is my first review here, as I never felt I wanted to share my thoughts about movies publicly, until this very moment... Gosh, this film was very brutal and I do not mean sex scenes. Broadly speaking, actors, dialogs and all that jazz came across rather fake and completely unnatural.. not mentioning the plot with the contract and T&C's... what? Even the sex scenes seemed not interesting, you usually get much saucy stuff in movies for 15's! SO over all folks, such a waste of time... The only, ONLY decent thing in this movie was music.. that's all and I really mean it... SO if they plan to shot a second episode, than I am moving to Moon... I am giving this film ONE star and that is only because I cannot give it a ZERO!! :)"
"clara-arfs","8","7","17","13 February 2015"," What makes the movie really impressive...
","Can't believe the movie called Fifty Shades of Grey is as low rated as 3,4. How is it to come? Me myself became really impressed by the way the producer built the movie. When you see Christian Grey with Anastasia, flying a helicopter - while the sounds of the most perfect soundtracks goes on.. There's no words! I almost cried.<br/><br/>I have really tried to find some consequences and bad sides of the movie - but it's really hard! Of course, I'm still a bit concerned about what really lies behind Mr. Grey's bad behavior (since I haven't read the books), but I hope that the coming movies will expose that...<br/><br/>My love for this movies is, as you can see, overwhelming. It has it all - the actors has it, the architecture has it, the music has it, the art director has it, the artists has it, the movie makers has it, the producers has it - the taste of HOW to make a great movie. Looking forward to the next two..."
"josephanthonyquinn","1","4","8","16 July 2015"," sex scenes are lame, plot is ignorant and insulting
","A baser reason one might watch this is to see the sex scenes, but even those are disappointing. The BDSM stuff that is actually shown is the kind that non-kinky folks might try just to be mix things up a bit in the bedroom. When I hear about places banning or cutting scenes, I wonder if the filmmakers encouraged this to build a rep. There are loads of better sources for bondage scenes out there, making this movie totally worthless in that department.<br/><br/>Now it would be interesting to explore the dynamic that might result if two people fell in love where one of them is way into BDSM and the other is categorically turned off by that stuff. It would be cool to see love set against an irresolvable sexual preference in that way, and to explore the process of discovering how much trust and respect between people is really involved in BDSM stuff. Unfortunately this movie doesn't do those things.<br/><br/>Instead, the film tries to convince us that the only reason someone might be into dominance role-playing is if he's a controlling selfish jerk who is not capable of love. The movie's only victory is a completely failure to communicate, both between the characters on screen, and between the filmmakers and their subject matter."
"sweeeetmikey","1","4","8","15 July 2015"," It makes me cringe knowing there are two more movies coming soon
","FIFTY SHADES OF GREY review by Mike Smith <br/><br/>Literature student Anastasia Steele's life changes forever when she meets handsome, yet tormented, billionaire Christian Grey.<br/><br/>When I write a review I try to find at least one good thing about every movie. That being said, Fifty shades of grey had NOTHING to contribute to my cinematic love. The cast is terrible; Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan have no on screen chemistry. They don't keep us interested in the film because they can't act. At one point Charlie Hunnam was attached to play the main role of Christian Gray and after wasting a hour and fifty minutes on this abortion I really think he would have brought some acting to this train wreck. The writing is crap and Christian Gray came off more like a stalker and a creeper. Anastasia Steele seems like she is slow and dumb. One thing that pisses me off about this movie is that if Christian Gray was just an average guy, not a billionaire, the tone of the movie would be completely different. The music is just dark ominous tones or crappy covers of songs.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the sex scenes, there is nothing special about any of it. So what, you see her boobs not a big deal, but the sex parts (which is what the books are built upon) are nothing to be excited about. I should have just watched a real porno! There would have been a better story and much better acting. It makes me cringe knowing there are two more movies coming soon. Cheers and remember I watch the crappy movies so you don't have too.<br/><br/>0.5 out of 10 <br/><br/>edited by Samantha Locke <br/><br/>Twitter: FatMikeTPK <br/><br/>Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/FatMikesMovieReviews"
"btwsfinest","8","4","8","19 June 2015"," Liked it, Really liked it. Sorry folks!
","OK. I literally just finished this movie on Redbox. I liked it, I really liked it. I guess I'm a weirdo since everyone else seems to seriously hate it. Let me preface this: I haven't read the book, I'm a 32 year old wife & mother. I enjoyed every second. Okay, so the story line is a bit far fetched. He's an elusive, intimidating billionaire under 30 surrounded by beautiful women all the time at his office. He meets this mousy, plain college student & is immediately intrigued. I didn't buy that part. The acting and chemistry between the 2 actors were good enough for me. The sex scenes were nice. Just enough, not overboard. I'm tempted to start the DVD over and watch it again. I like it that much. I wanted it to go deeper into Christian's back story but I'm sure it'll get there in part 2 or 3."
"Wirxaw","8","4","8","15 June 2015"," Magnificent.
","Well, what can I say. It's not Titanic, which I haven't watched nor ever will. It's probably not some... top of the line romance with actors not only enthralling, but also literally disturbing in a pleasant way to both genders.<br/><br/>It's a movie made to feel uncomfortable and... relevant.<br/><br/>Some may discuss the matter of BDSM quality and nature presented in the movie. I doubt it's worthwhile. What's shown in the movie is... a joke, a breeze compared to real BDSM. After all, Hollywood is not shooting porn. There are other sources for that, plenty.<br/><br/>I will admit that the premise of the movie, which is inspired by the book I probably won't read, is indeed clich√É¬©. Take some Disney prince, add Twilight girl and then seal it with BDSM. People are right when they say that the movie isn't really refreshing the genre.<br/><br/>But the way the relationship is delivered... it's something that's hard to describe. Some people might smile and find themselves there. Some might visualize their dreams. Some - learn something about themselves, discover the answer to certain... confusions.<br/><br/>So as a sick pervert, I can say that Mr. Grey was played out... extremely well. He's been there. All the joys, all the wonders of hormonal cocktail have been opened to him. The very idea of romance is plain, if not disturbing. Christian doesn't find sex by itself to be the reward. When a child shoots a toy pistol with juvenile glee - an adult looks at his hands and realizes that he has once held a gun that took lives. He knew that he will never see it as a toy. Christian does not need romance. He can afford to be laid ""on cooldown"" by the best models. He can afford any... doll. He had 15 already. Hell, 95% of all women would die for the chance that Anastasia had.<br/><br/>This brings me to the question of the main heroine. The amount of retarded in her is probably palpable even to female audience. To keep her virginity only to lose it on one night's stand of sorts, then to be littered with money, toy with the lover, even test him... She said she fell in love with him. She said she wanted to understand him. And after 6 whips, she collapsed? Boy, now that is a very, very spoiled child. Any girl her age would probably swallow such whipping naturally, but she just had to... Well, to be honest, I think it's artificial. It's the cliffhanger for the sequel, nothing else. She is female, she is dumb, and she had to act out.<br/><br/>But back to the subject of Grey. Some people say that he didn't love her, that he can't even love. These people... I'm afraid to live in the world where they procreate. Perhaps they should read some Great Expectations... or just live their American dream. Smarter people might say that his chivalry was nothing short of outright ""purchasing"". I beg to differ. It is the innocent, unbending, yet cute nature of hers that sparked his interest. Like I said, there's nothing he couldn't afford. For all the gifts he gave her, he could've already made her disappear and be his slave until she outlives her use. Why would he bother to not only charm her, but also clearly explain his reasons of the contract, prepare her, reassure and even tolerate getting ""changed"" by her whines? There's a good line in the movie: ""If you agree to be my submissive, I will be devoted to you"". Few men know what they want in life, and when it goes along the line of ""skirt"" or ""family""... well, bad things happen. But some men want something else, something often not tied to physical standards. Something emotional. Such men remain loyal, because their sole desire has been achieved. He could toy around with any female, but he fell in love with her character. The only thing she'd need to do - is to live by his standards, because he can't go the other way around(and nor should be, he isn't exactly Jose). This would fill his heart with something he couldn't get from physical ecstasy alone.<br/><br/>After all, if she really loved him... not his wealth or his looks... she would tolerate things that would make 6 whips feel like feather licking your cheek, compared to the reality that we live in. Because he loved not her physique - she was god damn ugly. And not her ""accessibility"", that's not a concern for a man like him. He loved that (supposedly) intelligent mind, romantic, daring and brave. He loved her so much that he allowed her to change him. And that's saying something.<br/><br/>Well, I hope this review explained some possible misunderstandings that people could have, but I still end on the same note I started with:<br/><br/>""The move is personal. You either recognize it or you don't."""

This has been one of the worst movie experiences we have ever been through. The plot is very polluted with nonsense that makes little to no sense at all, and the dialogue is so cheesy and predictable it is as if a 12 year old girl who reads too much Fanfiction wrote it.<br/><br/>Seriously ladies, is this really your idea of an erotic fantasy? I've watched porn with better plots and more believable romance.<br/><br/>It really is no wonder why the main stars want more money for the sequel, after all, there is no way this doesn't damage their careers.<br/><br/>There really isn't much more to say about this movie, except: It was a crap flavored Ice Cream Sundae with more crap on top, sprinkled with little pieces of crap, and then topped with nice fresh steaming crap...

"SamanthaShani","9","4","8","3 April 2015"," Fully enjoyable.
","I have never read the books, nor felt the urge to, and I fully enjoyed this movie. I didn't find it offensive, in bad taste, or insulting to my intelligence. It seems that a lot of the negative reviews criticise the content, content that is milder than some sex scenes I've seen in other movies, and that the negativity towards the books has intruded people's thoughts about the movie, so people cannot see it as a stand alone. It's pretty much a classic love story with a twist. All the one star ratings seem pretty unfounded, and a lot of reviewers come across as pretty desperate to be intentionally spiteful towards the movie. I, for one, am looking forward to the second film."

","I read the reviews before I watched it and I thought I'd give it a chance and maybe just maybe everyone else was being really mean because it was ""mainstream"" to hate this movie. Well, I was wrong. It truly and undoubtedly is an awful film. I don't understand how it had enough funding to actually be filmed and produced. Who the hell would put their money into a film like this? It's truly the worst movie I've ever watched. Even the sex scenes (more like rape scenes) were just disgusting. I didn't find myself even remotely interested in what was going on. Hell, I feel even worse for making my husband watch it with me. it was a waste of two hours of my life that i'll never get back.

For example; step one in BDSM is trust and to never ever dismiss a safe word. This is a classical case of rape culture where rape and sexual assault hides behind a kink. <br/><br/>I hate seeing this movie normalize and especially idealize a relationship that is genuinely dangerous.

With that being said, the content of the movie was just awful. Acting was decent, but the sex scenes were not very titillating due to the false relationship between the Sub and Dom. I felt bad for her and found it hard to watch. I figured a Sub/Dom relationship consists of two people who desire that type of relationship.

"valeria-83","9","4","8","1 March 2015"," What is all the fuss about???
","I don't understand what all the fuss is about? Fine, I get that people criticize the books - they are extremely poorly written. The author really needs to learn how to write properly. Its similarities with Twilight is pretty obvious from time to time, but that is because it IS a fan fiction of Twilight (at least to start with).<br/><br/>But there is nothing wrong with the story, in my opinion. It's a love story about how to different people fall for each other and tries to work out a good way to be able to be with each other. This is what the story is all about, and to see the full context people should judge the story after reading it to the end (or watching the last 2 future movies). It's impossible to judge it completely without see the whole picture.<br/><br/>About the naughty parts... People scream that Mr Grey is an abuser and rapist etc. He does NOT rape Ana in the movie (or in the books - EVER). He does NOT do anything she doesn't want to do. The sex scenes were erotic, but how prude is the audience to react on those? (The last scene made me uncomfortable though, but it was on Anastasias initiative, and she could have said the safe word, but she didn't). And those who say this is not what BDSMis about at all, that this is giving BDSM an ugly face and is worse than BDSM... I have been involved in that world, I have read a contract pretty much EXACTLY like Mr Greys. I have been to parties with rooms looking like Mr Greys... I have seen WORSE things happen to other submissive' than what we saw in this film. This was NOTHING. To be honest, this is not BDSM at all - people who practice BDSM shouldn't care about this movie, because pretty much everything being done between Mr Grey and Anastasia can be done in the most ordinary relationships: 1. Spanking while having sex? Fine. Spanking is pretty common in vanilla-relationships. I bet most of you have been spanked once or twice will having being sexual active - admitting it or not. If you really haven't: it can be a real turn on. Just FYI. 2. Being tied up? Oh, thats not all to uncommon in vanilla either. Can also be hot, if its done with a person you trust. 3. Blindfold? Not to uncommon either. Taking one sense away will activate all the other senses so much more. If you have not tried it - you should. As said earlier; EVERYTHING (except perhaps the last scene) can happen in ordinary relationships as well. All of you who scream what a rapist and psychopath Mr Grey is... HOW FRIKKIN POOR ARE YOUR SEX LIFES?? :/<br/><br/>I think the movie are underestimated. It's good acting, Dornan as Mr Grey wouldn't have been my first choice, but he grew into the role in some way. He is a good actor, and if I didn't know he came from UK I would never have guessed it (thinking of the accent). Dakota was AWESOME as Anastasia. She had the looks, the personality, the innocence... She WAS Anastasia Steele. The script was not the best. They had shortened down a lot of important scenes, and it was some flaws from time to time. Its forgivable, though. Hopefully the sequel will be better. The actors worked well together, their sex scenes were steamy in a sensual and beautiful way - not the pornographic way, as some might have expected. I think people are giving the movie such low ratings either because they already decided to hate the movie or expected porn (and was disappointed when they realized its a love story). Some people probably give it a 0 and scream ""abusive to women"" just because so many others are doing it, and they would be ashamed to admit that the movie is actually pretty good. <br/><br/>I think its a nice love story, seeing how 2 so completely different people fall in love with each other, and how Ana succeeds to heal such a broken soul as Mr Greys. (I have read the other 2 books). I'm looking forward to the next film! <br/><br/>And please, I would take Mr Grey any day of the year instead of Edward Cullen! Who wouldn't???"
"sbsammy2003","5","4","8","25 February 2015"," As a fan of the book, I wan't impressed
","I wouldn't go as far as some others have by calling it the worst movie ever made, it had some highlights and after breaking box office records one can surmise that is has a strong appeal. However, from book to movie this adaptation was below average.<br/><br/>I was never happy with the casting, I always thought that Christian Grey was a very muscular and tall man, similar to Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, and I imagined Ana quite petite- I felt that Christian was physically dominant over Ana in this way. Jamie and Dakota are a very similar build and the contrast between the two is not clear, they're just two normal people. As for Jamie as Christian Grey he did not capture the ever dominant, possessive, obsessive tortured billionaire- and not as charming and charismatic as described in the books. I saw little appeal to be honest, perhaps after those high expectations.<br/><br/>While he looked more like Christian than Charlie Hunman, I wonder if Charlie was better suited? Dakota I felt was very bland, I did not believe Christian would obsess over her, she was just another girl. <br/><br/>A lot of the sex scenes were toned down for the movie, and a lot of characters were cut out. I can understand this for time constraints but it felt very rushed to me.<br/><br/>I heard the rumors that Jamie and Dakota didn't get along during filming and if that is true it explains a lot, there was very little chemistry between the two.<br/><br/>There were some moments that were good, the elevator kiss and the first sex scene were good, but not necessarily as good as they could have been. <br/><br/>Having said all that, I'll be back for the sequel. Don't judge me"
"halexjack","9","4","8","25 February 2015"," What did people expect?
","I have read a lot of the reviews listed on here, and I have to say I do not know what you expected from the film. Seeing as it was based on poorly written books I think the they have worked wonders. I loved the books even though they were not literary masterpieces. I loved the love story that wove through the 3 books, and this is what the director has chosen to go with rather than just the S&M angle. There is no rape or domestic abuse in the film so where people get that from is beyond me. All the sex is consensual and I think very well done. Jamie Dornan played Christian brilliantly even if occasionally you could occasionally just hear a slight Irish lilt.. in the book he is a control freak and very closed off so how else was he supposed to portray him?? I was not keen on Dakota Johnson when I heard she was playing Ana but I think she grew better as the film progressed. I loved the ending it left you wanting more, and I really hope that they ignore the harsh reviews and listen to the majority and make the other 2 films as it is a trilogy."

","Superb movie!, the right ingredients, a bit of fresh air in the dull & monotonous movie industry. In my opinion & my wife's, Dakota & Jamie carried out the roles with no flaws. Luckily, I have learned not to trust movie critics or other reviewers, I usually trust the box office: $409M & counting...<br/><br/>My wife & I apply the theory of relativity to every aspect of life. Everything can be seen from many different angles, there are usually more than two sides to every story, there will be many opinions about any given subject, etc.<br/><br/>We have been married for 16 years & together for 20, and are very excited about this film and will be trying some of the soft core stuff we saw.<br/><br/>Gotta go, have to find my favorite tie."
"cesarbau","7","4","8","19 February 2015"," Dark corridors of sexual euphemisms
","(Spoiler Alert: This Cesar Marciano review may contain details that certain readers would rather not know or realize right away.)<br/><br/>In ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" every set is spic and span, rooms and corridors straight from the pages of Architectural Digest. Every piece of clothing is a fashion statement on casual coolness or formal impressiveness, as in Vogue or Esquire. Every rack or drawer whether in a hardware store or a dedicated sadist's ""playroom"" is in perfect order. One can be in awe over pieces of equipment that are clearly new and arranged impeccably, as if they're to be used for the first time. <br/><br/>And so are the people in the most successfully marketed movies in recent years. The secretaries of billionaire Christian Grey look like they didn't have to go through an interview, though they were picked along stringent standards of elite model agencies or fashion reality shows. The supporting characters such as the parents have the perfect jobs and the right temperament, their exits and entrances carefully plotted and counted, their needs and desires clear-cut. Read that: mostly nonexistent.<br/><br/>None of the supporting personae actually questions any other non-character's action, nor raises objection to anything, come to think of it. Everyone seems to be oblivious to the story's explosive central theme, namely dominance and submission in sexual relationships. <br/><br/>Everyone except The Dedicated Dominant Master and His Reluctant Submissive Trainee, whose sole purpose is to dig, no matter how shallowly, into the minute details of what can be a potent aphrodisiac in sexual relationships but at the same time a psychological and moral Pandora's box.<br/><br/>Its psychological strands can fill up a college textbook. The moral issues revolve around what is at its core a deeply religious set of questions: Do our bodies really belong to us? Is pleasure a sin? What role does sex play in the hierarchy of values? <br/><br/>The model-agency handsome Dedicated Dominant Master is presumably a young woman's dream. He's got the money, a stable of sleek cars, a condo unit in every city he needs to be, and above all the time to engage in his singular passion. He's got not just her number but her exact geographical location on his mobile phone. So very badly does he need to extract a narcissistic sexual high from the model-agency-pretty college graduate that he plies her with costly treats, rewards and even concessions, insisting that she signs what seems to be a legally binding consent form. <br/><br/>The Reluctant Submissive Trainee seems to be drawn to the training process and sample excitation sessions, but she's of two minds about the rules and consent form. Dressed up in ad agencies' mandatory designer suit, she negotiates The Sex Contract's details right in his headquarters' conference room, no holds barred, businessman-to-businesswoman, striking out several items that could be hair-raising for ordinary people like us but are really quite normal and delightful to ""The Dominant"" and ""The Submissive.""<br/><br/>""Fifty Shades of Grey"" titillates with its tautly choreographed and intelligently edited scenes of initiation into the dark corridors of sexual euphemisms. Pain is pleasure, and pleasure pain. A low point in a person's life is the ""high"" of another. There are ""50 shades"" of playroom pleasures, a number of them bordering on violence and courting permanent physical damage. Also, the ""first time"" doesn't just apply to the still-a-virgin heroine but to many who have flocked to the theaters. The frisson of the ""first time"" -- ahhh this could be the key to this movie's wild success. Virgins are queuing up for tickets. Masters-wannabes are jotting down mental notes on how to train a slave. Dress rich. Act rich. Reward rich. And punish hard. <br/><br/>Dakota Johnson's sensitive performance as Anastasia, infused with vulnerability, is enhanced by director Sam Taylor-Johnson's attempt, which works very well for the most part, to make a human out of an inflatable doll. To those involved with casting, model-agency handsome Jamie Dornan proves to be a good pick for the role of The Magnate With a Quirk That Tabloids Must Not Find Out. Dornan subversively exudes not the macho-ness expected perhaps of porn-flick studs but a sweetness of character that is the opposite of certified all- male.<br/><br/>Dakota and Jamie's rewards may not be great in heaven, but in the film world, they certainly will be. In fact they already are. I've just been told that there will be a sequel.<br/><br/>Ah, what the heck. It's only sex."
"samjmolloy","8","4","8","18 February 2015"," It's not as bad as all the negative reviews are saying
","I went with my husband and was quite wary as to whether he would stay for the duration. I have read all the books he has read none (no real surprise for a guy). There is an actual story there which we both discussed afterwards. My husband said that he could understand how Mr Grey is the way he is as he has been conditioned that way and doesn't really know any different until he meets Ana. It's a film yes, it's fictional yes, but there are troubled people like them in the world. They are both quite alike yet so different and after reading all 3 books it is a journey that you go on and are sucked into their lives, the erotic elements in the book become tiresome after a while yet still capture your imagination but you want to turn the pages to see the relationship develop and to see Christian and Ana evolve. I was disappointed that the movie left so many things out in the script from what you get in the book. The movie didn't really provoke your imagination as the books did. It did seem a little disjointed at times and I think the sequels will be so much better"
"euroGary","7","4","8","17 February 2015"," Can't wait for the out-takes...
","First I had to negotiate the Odeon Leicester Square's bizarre pricing policy (although the cinema's signage stated seats cost ¬£16, the box office boy told me they were actually ¬£17 - some sort of first week supplement, apparently. Fair enough, but update your signage to match, Odeon - false advertising is not good!) Then I could settle down to watch the most talked-about film of the year.<br/><br/>The plot is largely Mills and Boon territory - student Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) interviews rich-yet-sexy businessman Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for her university's newspaper. He is enigmatic, remote and mysterious; she na√Øve, virginal and innocent, so - as these things always go - they are instantly smitten with each other. Christian romances her with his smooth talk (""I won't touch you without your express written permission"" he says romantically) while Anastasia dithers about whether she wants to agree to his demands.<br/><br/>The wrinkle in the plot is, as is well known, Christian's bedroom activities: he's a 'dominant', and wants Ana to be on the receiving end of his collection of ropes, handcuffs, whips (and dildos, mentioned but never shown - a bit like Dornan's flesh-and-blood one). But the sex scenes make little use of these utensils: indeed, by some standards they're relatively tame - if a little more frequent - than some material seen in films nowadays. The lack of a full-frontal shot from Dornan has been widely commented on, but I think it was the right decision: the mysterious and enigmatic Christian would seem a little less so if we saw everything he has to offer and, let's face it, many men don't look that impressive frontally naked unless they're erect - and Hollywood was never going to show *that*. Perhaps if the film had been made in the UK or Europe?<br/><br/>Given the clich√©d nature of the material, the acting is acceptable. Johnson (who looks very much like her father Don, lending an unexpected dimension to the close-up shots of her and Dornan kissing!) makes a likable and believable heroine, caught up in something completely new and perhaps disgusted that she finds it exciting. The Irish Dornan delivers a passable American accent (but why not hire an American actor?) and, with subtle twitches of the lips or soulful glances of his mis-sized eyes, conveys a bit more depth to the stereotyped romantic hero. Plus they both look very nice naked, although given director Sam Taylor-Johnson's liberal use of close-ups, it's not always possible to tell whether we're seeing Johnson and Dornan's bits or those belonging to the many stunt players listed in the cast list. The set-designers - not usually a group of people I think to praise - do well too, from Ana's cheerfully chaotic apartment, through Christian's expensive interior-designer-sterile apartment, to his red-themed rumpus room.<br/><br/>Is the film worth seeing? Yes. It has more depth than the books' smutty reputation would suggest, and I am sufficiently interested in the characters to hope the open ending is closed in a possible sequel (not having read the books, I don't know how the story ends - or even if this film covers all the story written by E L James).<br/><br/>And I can't wait to see the out-takes section of the DVD..."
"Annabelle3149","7","4","8","17 February 2015"," Fifty Shades of Conflicted
","Okay, so...I watched this movie at about 9:50 Sunday night, and thought it wasn't very good. In fact, I have it a 4/10. The next day, I went again (with a different person) and watched it from a different perspective. (As if it were just a movie, not based off of a book) and realized that it was actually pretty good. <br/><br/>However, I think the reason that the reviews for it have been so awful are because they changed the movie from Rated ""NC-17"" to ""R"" which meant they had to take a fair amount out in order to make it acceptable to the public eye...and people under the age of 18. My personal opinion is that this was a mistake...I think a fair amount of the drama and the angst in the book was diminished because certain parts were no longer able to make the ""cut"". This, made it less appealing to those who had read the book and it was a bit disappointing. There were parts in the book where Christian took Ana's panties and refused to give them back, there were times when sex scenes were much more graphic, and in a way I think people looked forward to these events in the movie. (Yes, I realize how nasty it sounds, but admit it to yourself, that's a big reason why people read and watched.) Yes, in the movie he took her panties, but it wasn't made entirely clear to the viewers and you wouldn't pick up on it unless you were thinking about it and had thoroughly read the book. <br/><br/>There are also those out there who know that Fifty Shades of Grey was based off of Twilight. So, not only were there the Twi-haters that were out to wreak havoc, but there were also the Femi-Nazis that couldn't stand Ana, and believed that she was subservient. The movie was bound to tank as far as reviews go, but that doesn't mean that it was necessarily a bad movie. I just think that some fans were let down, because that ""electricity"" that they had come to know in the book, just wasn't there in the movie because it had been down-rated<br/><br/>One more thing that I have to get off of my chest: Just because you liked this movie does NOT mean you're into BDSM. Sorry to burst your bubble, but the book and even the movie didn't directly explain or fairly depict the lifestyle, so just because someone thinks they want to try kinky sex does NOT mean they're into the actual BDSM life. Being a submissive or a dominant is a huge responsibility and it takes a lot of trust, and care. I sincerely hope this movie doesn't cause an influx of people into the BDSM community, not only because -as I said before- I think that people are going to be misled, but also because I think it could cause a lot of problems. <br/><br/>If you're going to try these things...be in a safe environment, PLEASE. Don't let someone you don't know well tie you up or whip you. Go to a club if need be, and stay safe. Get it off your chest. But, do it in a safe, sane, and consensual way. <br/><br/>Anyways, now that I've babbled on forever and expressed my opinion. I have to say...I liked the movie. Yes, I was a little disappointed because of the drop from NC-17 to R, but I still have hope for the rest of the series, and think that the first movie was well-written and directed. I have to admit, after watching this, there is NO way I could be an actor/actress. It would be too difficult to keep a straight face, so props to Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan for making a great book come to life in the best way they could with the restrictions they faced. Thank you for reading."
"carroyo08","8","4","8","17 February 2015"," Not a bad book to movie adaptation
","First off I read the books multiple times and I enjoyed them. I had to watch the movie twice, since the first time I spent the majority of the time comparing the book and movie. Which left me wanting more and feeling confused.. After watching it the second time I was able to enjoy it as just a movie. I loved it... Dakota did an amazing Ana she added so much humor I was not expecting. She was better than book Ana at least for me. And Jamie Dornan, holy hotness! He played Mr. Grey perfectly he didn't show feeling or emotion which is how Christian is described in the book. He would smile or give you just a little taste of the walls crumbling from around his heart. And there was chemistry for sure! Anyone who didn't see it was blind and or deaf! The sex scenes were perfect and tastefully done. The redroom was perfect exactly how I had pictured it in my head. The last scene... You could feel and see the torture behind Christians eyes and the pain he felt after Ana told him NO and left. That last scene literally broke me, I had read that so many times in the book, and to see it played out exceeded my expectations. Was it different than the book yes but I thought Jamie and Dakota put everything in that scene and left nothing to be desired! The music/ soundtrack was amazing I had to have it and I have it on repeat! The only thing I want to say is I missed some of the banter between Ana and CG that was in the book that did not make it to the movie. Things I thought were crucial to understand the story if you had not read the book before. But I blame that on the screen writer and hope that they have a new screenwriter for the Fifty Shades Darker film. All in all I would watch this movie over and over and can't wait for the coming sequels because you know that will happen!!"

","There was some room for improvement but they followed the books pretty accurately leaving out some but that is to be expected. They did a great job on the characters and it was awesome to see one of my favorite books come to life. As far as the abusive relationship nonsense I am getting so sick of seeing this. If you give it a chance you would see that Ana is a strong in dependant woman who changes Christian for the better . He doesn't do anything to her she doesn't want and when she is unhappy she makes it pretty clear. I think a lot of viewers on here are being way too harsh. This would have bee a difficult movie to make and they did a fantastic job."

I just finished watching the movie and i must say it's sad that it has so poor grades on IMDb. The movie was very interesting and almost 2 hours passed like nothing. Dakota's acting was simply great,while Jamie's accent was weird in the beginning but after when it gets hot you forget about that and just watch the movie.

","I read the reviews and I wonder, who are these people and why they wanted to see this film in the first place. I think they came to it expecting a regular porn. Well, it's totally not that. It's a romance, people. Yes, there is a lot of sex scenes, it's erotic, but not more, because it's really about relationships. How it's never the imagined ideal, no matter how great it looks on the outside. People are flawed, and so are relationships, and Anastasia tries to build a relationship with a very beautiful and successful, but very conflicted and emotionally damaged young man. It's totally beautiful. I cried. The actors are very well chosen (I read and enjoyed the books, and I think they're perfect for the role). The acting is terrific, too. Dakota is totally heartbreaking, she perfectly enacts the very vulnerable, yet strong willed, and passionately in love young woman. Jamie is dashing, very confident, a perfect Grey. In short, I enjoyed the movie very much and am going to see it again. Looking forward to the next installment!"

Five minutes into the movie I knew I would hate it. The icing on the cake was the scene after she interviews Christian and he says ""Anastasia"" at the elevator, it sounded so put on and fake. And I found this through the whole movie. <br/><br/>The acting is horrible and wooden. The main actors American accent is SO bad. He can't keep the accent up so very often during the movie he slips up. The girl is slightly better but still bad. The two of them have absolutely no chemistry. None at all. The lack of chemistry is what makes so many of the scenes laughable. She looks very old for her age and she looks tired most of the movie. I found all the acting scenes put on and I couldn't take one scene seriously. I spent majority of the time laughing out loud. The only reason I didn't leave the cinema is because my friend paid for my ticket. Oh and I went to go get some extra food to get myself through the second half of the movie. The sex scenes.. well because the two leads had no chemistry and can't act, I found myself laughing and cringing again.<br/><br/>And who the frek cast Rita Ora in this movie?

Fifty shades of grey was hard for me to get through without nodding off.<br/><br/>I didn't think the acting was heinous on Jamie Dornan's part, but I did find him to be a bit robotic. I believe the script didn't help him out at all.<br/><br/>I actually couldn't stand Dakota Johnson's performance. All the overreacting and nauseating Mmmmm's every time Christian touched Anastasia was just too much. The lip biting was supposed to be innocently sexy, but it made my skin crawl. She didn't do it right. I hated her voice. I'm not sure if she was trying to sound like a breathless pre-teen most of the time, but if she was; she did succeed at that.<br/><br/>Christian would scarcely put a finger on her and she would be writhing and wriggling around like he was doing something more. There were times when he wasn't doing anything at all and she would moan and act like he was.<br/><br/>During some of the bondage scenes, you would swear she was being beaten based on the expressions and sounds she made. It was way too much for just one wimpy smack on the bottom, very unrealistic.<br/><br/>I didn't find anything good about this movie. The soundtrack was too loud. Everything was just wrong.

I am surprised how everyone has been so nice even to writer while taking interviews and when TV Programmes are on.Books are like this biggest global phenomenon. It is nothing new for centuries men has dominated women. Now you can see them doing it with consent in a lavish environment. <br/><br/>I strongly believe in equality of sexes. If you do not then this is the movie for you if you like to be dominated -BDSM is for you. <br/><br/>Movies like these are disgrace to women,in general. On one hand we are trying to empower women and on the other hand they are being manipulated and bribed to be in abusive relationship.It is no different than somewhere in Middle East somebody having sex slave.<br/><br/>Yes, women sexual needs should be liberated and women should explore their own sexuality but that never ever means in such a disgraceful way !! and men shouldn't have right to abuse women. It is not provocative romance.It is abusive relationship.Full stop.(Even if you get consent) As consent itself is a very subjective and debatable question. There is lot of gray area there. Anatasia being virgin also says she wouldn't know what her limits would be. <br/><br/>This is movie in time warp maybe when there were women slaves. Girls if you are looking for some sexiness Look at Magic Mike for some hot body and what women equality really means. Why is that only way women sexuality is ever spoken or shown in movies is in rape or when she is being dominated/abused. <br/><br/>As for Beauty and the Beast Syndrome - I guess by this time we should know you can not control or change anything except for yourself. Women who still thinks they need men to explore their sexuality should stop and start taking things in your own hands and in between your legs literally. YOU DO NOT NEED ABUSIVE MEN TO SHOW YOU HOW TO FEEL PLEASURABLE BY GIVING YOU PAIN. <br/><br/>Clever Marketing ! but do not fall for it.Everyone wants to know what Fifty Shades of Grey is. Save your money and buy music track as it is only saving grace as movie so desperately needs it. <br/><br/>Great work but how did ever ...ever Film board give permission for such nonsense !! <br/><br/>What an influence it would be in countries where men already like to control women. They would think oh West is already doing it we should as well."

","I don't usually write reviews, but today i'm feeling obliged to do so since i vehemently criticised people who did't bother to watch the movie and, guess what? They were right...<br/><br/>Firstly, I'd like to advise readers that I've never read the book and therefore my opinion does not regard the literary work. On the other hand, i assume it is bad - according to what i saw - and will not do it anyway. <br/><br/>So, why shouldn't you see it? I am not being presumptuous or anything, but the reason is that the movie is unbelievably and utterly bad. Everything is wrong since Its foundations. The badness does not contemplate one single part of the film, but goes from the actors to the plot itself. As a matter of fact, I can resume the entire feature in one single sentence: ""A girl gradually 'falls in love' with an unbelievably multitasked (and sadomasochist) billionaire"". That is it. Seriously, that is it. Nothing really important happens besides this. <br/><br/>Then you have the acting. The actress slowly improved in the middle of the story, however and until so she was truly horrific. Alternatively, the main actor was not that bad. His role did not require a magnificent performance, but still not pretty watchable. The rest of them don't really matter that much, they were just plugging holes anyway.<br/><br/>So, why 3 instead of 1? Because I don't think it was such an awful spectacle to deserve the very lowest grade. Nevertheless, it will not acquire any good reviews, since it completely failed to captivate the audience. The songs were quite catchy and there weren't the nasty parts the internet has been talking about - it is probably from the book - but still not a good idea.

"airka5984","8","5","11","21 February 2015"," enjoyed it and would see it again even though it wasn't perfect
","I'm really surprised to see all the terrible reviews for this movie. What I have noticed is many of these bad reviews seem to be from guys, or people who didn't read the book or didn't enjoy the book, or just aren't into this type of book or film. <br/><br/>I did read the books and I did enjoy them a lot. It's fiction, it's not supposed to paint an image of reality. The book and movie is for entertainment purposes. Maybe I'm not great at analyzing the components of movies, but I just don't see how all those reviewers thought it was that terrible.<br/><br/>I give it an 8 because I did enjoy the movie, and I want to go see it again. There aren't many movies that I would pay to see more than once. Not sure but maybe I enjoyed the movie so much just because I really enjoyed the books and I was biased going in. Either way it was a decent movie. I dragged my boyfriend with and he is not really into romance movies so this was not his choice of movie to see. He doesn't go to theaters unless it's hugs blockbuster film with lots of action and adventure...and maybe some super powers too. He agreed to see it only because it was valentine's day and while he did squirm uncomfortably in his seat for over 2 hours waiting for the end, he said it wasn't bad. He gives it a 5 out of 10 saying It was average. Of course, he didn't have the expectations that I had because he hadn't read the book. I think he was more curious to see what the hype was all about.<br/><br/>I thought the actors that were chosen worked out just fine. It's usually hard for me to accept the outcome of a movie made based on a book because I already have an idea in my head of what everyone looks like. There was no possible way to fill those roles and make everyone happy at the same time so in that case I think those involved in making the movie have every right to choose who they feel works best, it's there thing after all.<br/><br/>I did like that the movie when along with the book so well, I recognized tons of specific dialogue and scenes directly from the book. I really can't stand it when a film adaptation of a book is created that has too many changes or when they completely butcher important parts. I do wish that some scenes weren't cut out, and if I had it my way they wouldn't cut out or alter anything from the book but then we'd be settling in for a 12 hour movie. I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little disappointed that it only had an R rating because I don't feel the true soul of the story can be portrayed accurately when so much is dialed down or omitted. Maybe if it had been even more graphic then it wouldn't be referred to as a wanna be soft core porn-romance film. Maybe everyone would be so shocked by the intimate level of detail that the movie would be in a category all it's own.<br/><br/>On more complaint...Oddly enough I felt that the movie had a kind of fast pace to it. It was actually pretty long, longer than I had expected. I too couldn't stop moving around in my uncomfortable movie seat but I still didn't want it to end. It's hard to explain but even though I thought it was long, when the end came I felt myself wondering how it had gotten there so fast. I felt the pace of the whole movie was fast, how it progressed so quickly. Perhaps I'm just used to how the book went...when you read a book there is much more detail, the author depicts each character, prop, and setting with descriptive sentencing so the reader can form an image to go on. When it's all just out there on the screen in front of you, you have to take it in so quickly or you'll miss it all together. So I thought the progress of the story went quickly even though it followed the book very accurately.<br/><br/>Again, I enjoyed it and would see it again even though it wasn't exactly what I had imagined it to be when I read the book."

","Warning: There ARE SPOILERS in this review. Please don't read it if you haven't seen the film yet. Thank you again. The original source does contain images, videos if you would like a more visual review. <br/><br/>I RATE THE FILM 2/10, only because there were some nice cinematography effects and I enjoyed some of the lighting.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL Source: http://laura.productions/?p=1963<br/><br/>Best, <br/><br/>Laurara Monique (Film Critic)<br/><br/>MY REVIEW: <br/><br/>After watching 50 Shades of Grey, I can't help but wonder what the future will be like for my children and the many generations to come. When I was little Titanic hit theaters and it was the biggest hit for that time. Titanic was a true romantic film that focused on the BEAUTY of women as they are not as SLAVES. Women should be treated with love, respect and loyalty‚Äîespecially in the bedroom. Now, that's not to say I'm not a little kinky where it counts, we all have our quirks but this went beyond our what could be considered a 'normal,' fantasy. I'm sorry to say that 50 Shades of Grey was nothing more than a pornography that was given an extremely high budget. And because the rise of addiction with pornography across the nation, it's no surprise so many people ""LOVED,"" the film.<br/><br/>First, why in the hell do you women think it's perfectly fine to be compared to this unrealistic image on a screen? Film is supposed to be magical and there was NOTHING magical about this film. There was nothing unique, funny or inspiring. But, I can say there was a lot of lust, abuse and control‚Äîhey if your into that, sweet, see a psychologist(if it's to this degree). I am a women and I can acknowledge that we are ALL BEAUTIFUL and we deserve the absolute best in life.<br/><br/>I have three questions for you to consider: 1.When watching the film could you GET OFF to the scenes? 2.When watching the film did you just look forward to the sex scenes rather than the plot? 3.What made this movie artistic? (If you think this film was artistic then please let's debate this out).<br/><br/>If you answered yes to any of the questions then you are viewing pornography and technically making the women/man you love feel less perfect. Pornography has destroyed so many marriages and it's destroyed the way that men and women view one another. Instead of looking at your date and thinking:<br/><br/>""Gosh, I love his smiles, eyes, personality, goals, careers and how spontaneous he seems to be as a person."" It's become us undressing them with our eyes and imagining the way it would feel to get down with your DATE. Keyword there is DATE‚Äîisn't having sex meant for those married or at least in love? I've never been able to just spread my legs with a stranger I met at a bar. It's an accomplishment I'm very proud of because it reminds me that I was able to stay a virgin until I was married.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, the choice is yours to make and the consequences always come good and bad. If psychologists have something to say about a film and it's effects on the brain, the scriptures warn us and I have common sense to see this is yet another antic of those that pull the Hollywood strings. Don't be another puppet.50 Shades of Grey destroying relationships and youth? Yay or nay? We want to hear what YOU think. Blessed Be."

","The movie was good but not great. And here is why. If you haven't read the books ‚Äì I would not recommend seeing the movie. I really couldn't understand how someone could understand what was going on. I think Dakota Johnson did spot on job and very much portrayed the Anastasia ""Ana"" like the books. I think Jamie Dornan did a good job with the material that he had. I think that his mysterious aura, past demons and a deeper understanding of him is revealed in book 2. I do think overall that certain parts of the movie there was opportunities to fly a few more sparks.<br/><br/>I read the trilogy three times and understood there is no way to show the complete story (1501 pages) in a two-hour film. So, a lot people didn't understand that the movie was ONLY PART 1. So right when you were starting to get into the movie, it pretty much ended abruptly, and the screen went black. It should of stated at that time Part 2 Fifty Shades Darker coming in 2016. Universal has thankfully hired a new screenwriter for part 2. I'm excited about that because book 2 really gets into the guts of the story the characters and why Christian Grey is the way he is."

","I have zero expectation for this film as the review is soooo bad as well as what i have heard from my friends. But I just want to see how bad is this film. To my surprise I actually like it, and I thought the leads have good chemistry (while most reviews say they have zero chemistry.) To be fair after reading some of the reviews in IMDb which gave only 1 star, I realized all of them are guys and a lot of them keep using words to insult those women who likes it. I feel, they don't like it because it's not erotic enough for them. (Which in a matter of fact, I don't find the sex scene erotic at all and I was expecting something more intense.) But from the romance point of view, I think it's sweet and I love to see how much Christian actually love Ana yet he didn't realize. (I guess it is a girl thing, we like this kind of feeling.) So I feel the reviews are very personal and a very bias one."

","I liked the first book (others were not interesting) that was the reason why I watched the movie. The actors did not meet my expectations, especially Mr. Grey, his family, Kate and Ana's mother. Jamie Dornan was absolutely not sexy in this movie and because of this, not suitable for the role. His family looked like the Cullen family (vampires), Eliott and Mia was a disaster (in real life they look good, I do not know what happened to them). In the book they were handsome and beautiful. The only nice-looking person in the movie was Taylor (although I remember him as a black guy from the book), even he would be much more better Christian Grey despite of his age. The film was full of stupid scenes, Mr. Grey was sometimes more gawky than Anastasia. It was not an erotic film, rather a comedy. The visualization of the e-mail and text exchanges looked very cheap. I did not like Dakota in the movie, but as a young actress I think she did the best of she could. The apartment of Christian was modern and sophisticated in the book, in the movie it looked as the flat of an old guy from last century. I think that Hollywood is able to create much better book adaptations and this book gave them a good chance. Unfortunately the creators of 50 shades of Grey could not take advantage of this opportunity."

While watching the film I started to get bored and felt like the film was starting to drag (even though it is 2 hours long). There was a big hype about the film for about 2 years but it isn't what they make it out to be. If you want to watch 50 shades of Grey just watch the trailer all the good parts are in the trailer the rest of the film isn't very interesting. You may think I am being a prude but I am only young so I didn't care about the naked scenes if anything it spiced up the film and this is what makes people want to watch the film, women want to see Jamie Dornan naked if that is why you want watch the movie go ahead otherwise I wouldn't waste my money like other people are complaining about."

Quite surprised how short it seemed though, there was a lot that had to be crammed in, might have had a better result if it was a 3hr showing? (I would not have had a problem with this, my partner may have done). There is no way this could be seen as demeaning, this actually happens people, a way of life for some, a given choice.

I was there with a girl and we both enjoyed it a lot. Cant wait this movie to fallow up on the other 2 book editions. Hope all the negative feedback is ignored. I do not put myself out as specialist on rating this movie but I think I do have a good personal opinion about a lot of them out there. I would say negative feedback comes mostly from men with singular tastes of produced movies and would agree myself that it was something I did not expect to enjoy.

","Upset with myself for giving in to the hype of the film and seeing it on Valentine's Day. In A way I am glad that I saw it because I was uninterested but yet curious about the book due to a review by a friend. I have now been enlightened as to why she gave me the advice to steer clear of the book and also what the story is all about. I'm sure that the book is slightly better than the movie, as most cases are. The movie had sub-par acting, no background to it's characters or elaboration whatsoever & really no story to it. There is a boy meets girl plot with a bland, far-fetched twist and it can't end in a way that anyone will enjoy. Apparently the budget was spent on the fanciness of Christian Grey's lifestyle. The characters are not relatable or likable whatsoever. I actually hate Christian Grey and could not see how Anastasia could ""fall in love"" with a man anything like him! (especially due to the few characteristics that she displayed and the little background they gave her) They bestowed Anastasia half a personality and yet Christian gray, this impervious, elusive, fancy man, found her intriguing. It seemed as if he was the only guy that had ever noticed her so she liked him.. her being ""in love"" is childish to say the least, she did not seem to like the kind of person that he was or know anything deep about him. There was an obvious physical attraction and initial intimidation, not to mention he is a billionaire running his own company(in which no details were revealed). A normal girl's reaction to Christian Grey's behavior should be a restraining order due to his irrational behavior. He is a stalker with a lot of personal issues & childhood trauma (that neither I, nor Anastasia know much about). The whole movie, and I'm sure the book, was unrealistic. I am completely unbiased and could see things from a lot of different views but this is simply not a good film. I am convinced that people went to see this movie for Christian Grey & really all it is good for is provoking fantasies... but no amount of evocative images or elaborately framed thrusts could save this story.<br/><br/>2 Stars for the lighting and ambiance done right & for featuring one Rolling Stones song."

I feel the movie is about a couple who fall in love each impacting the other, like most human beings have between one another when they are falling in love with each other. True love is about the attraction, the passion and then of course the sex.The author and movie writers definitely brought that to the book and the movie theaters.

She won the lottery when she married the kid from Kick Ass so I guess she doesn't care what she puts on film for people to watch. <br/><br/>The producers should have never let E.L. have that much control over a script. Did anyone see the Secretary with James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhall? Did anyone see the remake of Thomas Crown Affair with Pierce Brosnan? It seems like those two films got merged and made into this pile of whatever it was. <br/><br/>I've heard the novels were plenty more graphic, so if that was the case, slap an NC-17 rating on it and get some actors that can act and make the film E.L.

"J-Star","8","5","11","16 February 2015"," Surprised me by being much better than its reputation
","I went to see this expecting the worst. Having read comments mainly from the BDSM community and literary commentators I presumed this would be a horrid experience. <br/><br/>It was not anything of the sort. This movie actually works quite well. Fifty Shades of Grey is not deserving of its bad reputation. People would do well to completely ignore the haters - and the swooning fans - and make up their own mind. <br/><br/>The story starts as the Twilight saga: the impossible young man gets infatuated with a bumbling virgin. And then the similarities end; these two stories go their separate ways. <br/><br/>The characters... <br/><br/>Anastasia is no wuss. She takes initiative, she communicates, she negotiates and she marks her borders. For being a complete amateur to romantic love, sex and BDSM she holds her own really well. The one thing I do not like about the character is that she(!) does not respect his(!!) limits. Then I remind myself: she is the amateur. She does not understand that a dominant needs their own limits. What she does is realistic. She is credibly portrayed by Dakota Johnson. <br/><br/>As for Christian, I pretty much expected him to be ignoring safe-words left and right. He does not. Despite some stalker tendencies, he actually respects all of Anastasia's limits when she states them. He actively seeks consent. He checks her state of mind before proceeding. He is not quite as credible though. More on that in a moment.<br/><br/>The visuals...<br/><br/>Flawless. There's nothing to complain about here. I especially liked the glider scene. <br/><br/>The story...<br/><br/>It works. I don't know what people are complaining about here. Christian and Anastasia's relationship proceeds through the steps smoothly and without being too convoluted. The one thing that makes story less credible is that the scriptwriter / author tries too hard to make Christian dysfunctional and incapable of romance, when in fact he is quite good at it! His supposed troubled background is conveyed only through spoken exposition and it does not match how we see him act. I cannot help but to think ""Lamp shading!"" when Anastasia calls him out on it. <br/><br/>What gives the story some zest is when Christian makes mistakes, like walking out on Anastasia after her first spanking and - more crucially - when he allows her to force him into a pain session. Supposedly he had been in her position for six years, so he should have known what a train wreck that would inevitably turn out (I suppose this is where the BDSM community gets their knickers in a twist). <br/><br/>But as a plot element to create tension and drama, this works! Not to mention it is realistic; had everything gone without a hitch we would be looking at a truly impossible story, not to mention a very boring one. Add to that the film tells us very clearly ""this was wrong, he just messed up"". You cannot - unless you are emphatically damaged - assume this is correct BDSM and with that the critique that real life practitioners have been delivering falls.<br/><br/>In summary: I think Fifty Shades of Grey does the job, defying its poor reputation and delivering a(n almost) credible, visually pleasing story. It surprised me and thawed me from my initially frosty expectations.

","This is a movie about a dumb girl in a sexual relationship with an abusive man, the end. This movie was boring! Dakota and Jamie did try to save this movie but the dialogs were too stupid, too boring. this felt a lot like twilight, i felt like watching Edward and Bella honeymoon, I enjoy twilight more than fifty shades of grey. this was not sexy neither romantic i don't know why they keep romanticizing this story, i didn't care about the characters at all. this is a movie you go watch with your friends to laugh because the dialogs are so stupid but the acting is so dramatic it makes you laugh, specially the ones where they talk about the contract. I really don't know what else to say about this movie, this is romanticizing by teens and women all over the world saying they want a relationship like this, and this book is an evidence that literature this days is dead. visually was kinda good but Entertaining? Na."
"ejulz","3","5","11","16 February 2015"," Soft Porn?
","Casting: Bad. Dakota and Jamie have no chemistry at all. The two have too many awkward & dull scenes together. I am not sure why they did not catch this mismatch before finalizing the cast members. Are the IMDb reviewers better at doing casting jobs than professionals?<br/><br/>Acting: Dakota's acting were mostly off up until the last 20 minutes of the movie. She seemed to struggle with the ""innocent"" Anastasia Steele, but she improved as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>Jamie's acting was so bad that would make Pinocchio jealous. Unless, of course, if the director wanted him to act like a wooden person, then if that's the case, he did a magnificent job. Pinocchio would be proud of his new brother. His outward appearance were acceptable for the job but his acting skills didn't fit the bill. He wasn't a believable troubled dominant.<br/><br/>Direction: Too many unnecessary stretched scenes and they were one after another. Story development were disturbingly slow that made my mind drift outside of the story most of the time. Many scenes were unbelievable or unrealistic. And the movie did not make an attempt to explain them why so. For example: Mr. Grey is the head/owner of a multi-billion dollar company but he has endless amount of free time to impress and wander with Anastasia. He travels around with her to ""kill time"" in the movie.<br/><br/>Plot: Very thin. Almost none. Maybe its made intentional to leave some for the sequel? I'm not sure but I know this movie almost doesn't have any plot at all.<br/><br/>Story: Unconvincing. Again, no attempts were made by the movie (director's and writers' fault) to convince the audience of the unbelievable parts of the story.<br/><br/>Writing: Amatueristic. Too many laughable lines and scenes. Mr. Grey initial meet up with Anastasia lasted ~10 minutes or so only but this short meeting started his obsession with her for no reason. <br/><br/>And I've lived in a town (SF) where BDSM is almost common and I have a clue or two about them. The movie has about as much or even less clue as I am about the BDSM. Contract? Pushed too much.<br/><br/>Nudity: If this is your reason for seeing this movie, then you will be satisfied. There were abundance of it. Dakota did all of her nudity scenes well. She didn't look awkward or uncomfortable on any of them, that's as far as I can detect.<br/><br/>If Jamie's nudity is what you're after, well, he's shirtless on almost half of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall: Again, not an enjoyable movie to see. Many laughable lines, scenes, and acting. The high ticket sales is explainable by the success of the book and brilliant marketing (using the news media to plug the movie, etc..). And lastly, because of being one of a kind of movie. Porn (almost) in the movie theaters.<br/><br/>So, is this a soft porn?: Nope. Almost though. The movie didn't cross the line to be considered porn. But this is the farthest a movie can go before it crosses the porn category. Lots of nudity. A few scenes of two naked bodies grinding. There were pounding. Bushes everywhere. Moons after one another. etc."

"david_ash99","8","5","11","15 February 2015"," works well as the first part of a trilogy
","Initially I didn't like this movie because it didn't seem to work well as a stand-alone film. Later, however, I learned that the novel on which this movie is based is the first offering in a three part series--and it makes much more sense in that context. The stage is set well early in the movie: Jamie Dornan is Christian Grey--a successful young billionaire whose sexuality is the subject of much speculation. Dornan is believed to be gay. In truth, however, Dornan is attracted solely to women--but he finds himself completely unable to relate to women except through sadomasochistic acts. Dakota Johnson is Ana Steele--a young college student (and later graduate) who is attracted to Dornan and is willing to explore sadomasochism but requires a more complete relationship.<br/><br/>Although we learn more about the backgrounds of the two main characters--especially Dornan's--they do not really progress psychologically beyond this basic impasse that is established early on. Thus the movie lacks a sense of resolution, but as the opening act in a trilogy, it may work quite well. I haven't read the later books to know how things progress.<br/><br/>Some have characterized this movie as condoning the abuse of women but I do not necessarily see it that way. Within the limited constraints of his sexuality, Dornan is actually quite respectful to Johnson. For example, at one point he wants her to sign an elaborate ""sex slave"" contract. It isn't clear if she ever signs it, but she takes the opportunity to have a conversation with Dornan about her limits or boundaries--Johnson will do this and won't do that--and he seems quite accepting of her limits. He doesn't hit her outside the context of agreed-upon sadomasochistic scenes, and when she says 'no' to anything--which she does more than once--he always backs off.<br/><br/>At the same time, this type of relationship is too limiting for Johnson--and that psychological conflict is explored here but never fully resolved. We can, however, hope that future movies develop the story further."
"mary-anne1988","6","5","11","15 February 2015"," 50 Shades of Prejudice
","Yes, I found the movie kinda silly. Yes, I found the acting a bit mediocre. But my biggest disappointment, much bigger than with the film, was with some extremely sexist and misogynist comments (which were supposed to be critical to the MOVIE) that I found on this page. Comments such as ""you women are all ridiculous for liking this kind of movie"", ""if that is what women like, then I lost faith in humanity"" and ""you deserve to be raped for liking man like Christian Grey "". For you, sexist and fascist men who live in a bubble of prejudice, I'll tell you something: you know absolutely NOTHING about what women like. How dare you judge a woman because she enjoys reading books/ watching erotic movies? Have you by any chance ever seen any woman say to the winds that ""men are all a disgusting and ridiculous for watching porn since the dawn of humanity""? Do you judge your (men) friends for watching porn movies? What do you think gives you the right to curse a woman by the films she watches or books she reads? I'll tell you one more thing, in case you do not know it already: you're a big of a coward, that's what you are. A coward who is afraid because women are taking charge of their sexuality without fear of talking about what they like and don't like. You're a coward and a fool because you think women have to be what you want them to be rather than what they really are. Because women are taking control over their own bodies as THEIRS, not as objects belonging to the men around them or to the society. You are a big coward, that's what you are. And I hope in my heart that one day you marry a silly, submissive and dull woman that doesn't question your coward and sexist attitudes because you do not have the balls to be with a woman who is determined and knows what she likes (in sex and in life). And no, I'm not an old unloved ugly with-no-sex-life lady (before you come up with your typically sexist and ridiculous comments). I'm (very well) married, thank you, and with a feminist and wonderful husband that yes, TAKES ME to the movies to watch 50 Shades of Gray because he knew I liked the books a lot. <br/><br/>And regarding the film (now down to business), although I found Jamie's acting mediocre, I was positively surprised with Dakota. She brought a graceful and delicate air to Anastasia that maybe in the book had not been so well portrayed. I loved her performance! I do think though that the writer could have taken the plot to the next level, making it better than the book and a more fluid history. They had the tools to do so. But I believe that the directing also had it share of blame. I read some professional reviews that the director was very inexperienced, and maybe that explains some flaws in the movie in general.<br/><br/>Overall, I found it an entertainer film. For me particularly lacked some scenes from the book that I missed, but I think it is a good program for a Friday night with the girlfriends or the boyfriend."
"jeph_b","8","5","11","14 February 2015"," Boring but a bit Sexy, Good Soundtrack
","I tried to watch this film with an open mind, it did have some positives so I'll start with them... Bear in mind I haven't read the book:<br/><br/>The Soundtrack was pretty good, some of the soft-core porn scenes where quite sexy, the actors are good looking, and the film eventually ended...<br/><br/>Another point of note, those claiming the film is about rape, can't be more wrong; in fact, the sex is so consensual, that 90% of the films dialogue is spent debating will she or won't she sign a contract to be his sex slave. The word prostitution comes to mind more than rape.<br/><br/>The plot was straight forward, it started with lots of boring slow dialogue and staring, then a soft porn scene, more boring staring and dialogue, porn scene, boring, porn, boring, domestic abuse, boring, credits.<br/><br/>The script and acting was poor and didn't capture my imagination at all, there were several poor jokes which I didn't find funny, such as 'I don't make love, I f***', yet the mostly female audience seemed to giggle away like school children to; must just require a female sense of humour i guess; the only moment I laughed at was when he said something along the lines of 'but first I need to get your consent in writing'. Meanwhile the sex scenes, did somewhat make you sit up and take notice. They aren't particularly shocking except perhaps for the scene where he beats her up with his belt.<br/><br/>The characters are non-believable and hard to relate too. Mr Grey is supposed to be desirable, however he's actually a complete prick who apart from a set of abs to be proud of, and being very rich, has nothing going for him at all. Women aren't that shallow are they? He stalks her, lavishes her with expensive gifts and refuses to be romantic in any way shape or form. It's the perfect clich√© that doesn't exist, rich handsome multi-talented manly fella who can't love because of his past, but she's going to 'tame' over the course of 3 movies I guess. Also, when does the billionaire entrepreneur who worked his way up from being an orphaned son of a hooker have time to master playing piano and being a helicopter pilot, all by the age 27? Not to mention his other extra curricula activities...<br/><br/>The female lead is a very week character too, so they expect us to believe a girl would be a virgin up until her college graduate year, and then a guy comes along and shows her his 'play room' and she doesn't run a mile? <br/><br/>Rita Ora was very disappointing, only on the screen for about 10 seconds, I expected a larger role for her...<br/><br/>The film is a return to 90's style erotica movies, like Wild Things and Basic Instinct. Only it isn't as good. To be fair the makers of this film are always going to be up against it; The book was popular I believe, not because it was a literary classic but because it was raunchy. It was always going to get made into a movie, but should never have been given the hype and the build up which this one has. If it is trying to be a soft-core B-movie which goes straight to DVD then it does a good job, but hyping it up and releasing it for valentines day is wrong, because millions will turn up and be exposed to something that in the end is rather tame.<br/><br/>All in all it's worth watching if you're curious; probably better than most people on here who give it 1 star, but please don't waste your money on it, download or wait till it's on TV!"

","What can I say, another director who cares more about making the money, rather than actually making a decent film. If your going to make a movie based on a controversial book, then go the whole 9 yards with it, Don't just tip toe around the topic. That's the feeling I got from this film, If anything; a couple more cuts here or there it could possibly of been a 15. I think that's the certificate the director was secretly going for (More money, more viewers) but realised that was not going to happen. Other reviewers have touched on the Twilight series comparison, I have to agree it's going down that route. To summarise; another poor adaptation which will leave many fans of the book, scratching their heads, thinking: was that it!"

I would classify this as soft core BDSM. A riding crop, flogger, a bit of spanking, lots of binding, and yeap that's about it.

","I must be one of the few straight men to have read the book, but five years ago everywhere you went you saw women engrossed in copies of it (which charity shops are now awash with), so I thought it might provide some useful insights into what women actually seek in men rather than what they say they do. The suposedly all-important Sense of Humour is little in evidence in Christian Grey, unlike the vast quantities of dosh and very expensive presents that he liberally sprays about to facilitate the charmless and very basic advances that unless allied to fabulous good looks or or the sort of wealth that enabled Bruce Wayne to found the Wayne Foundation would never on their own have got Christian Grey to first base with Miss Steele. (Both book and film are extremely vague about where his vast wealth comes from, other than the fact that he is using it to attempt to End World Hunger; but the carbon footprint from his private helicopter alone probably undoes all the good work his philanthropic endeavours facilitate.)<br/><br/>There is actually more sex in the film than in the book (which not surprisingly devotes far more space to his billionaire lifestyle - and precious little to his supposedly busy life as a hot-shot businessman - and with the haggling over the contract before their sub/dom relationship can commence), but it remains as chilly as it's inscrutable anti-hero and it's presumably the undivided attention that she's getting that women reading the book - and watching this movie - crave rather than the sex."

How dare they make a movie that absorbs you like a sponge. Shame on them! Cinematography was amazing, and it was so dark, you could barely see what was going on! How can I watch a movie if I can't see what's going on? I mean, what were they thinking? Are you complaining that it was nothing like the book? Well, that's why I quit going to the library, if there's any good books there, they'll find them, make a movie about it, and the movie is just going to wreak compared to the book, because the movie won't have any pages to it, and it will give you salty reviewers something else to belly ache about! ( Sighs) So that's out of the way, let me jump OFF the band wagon now. Fifty Shades of Grey is anything but an exciting film. It's not intended to be. What we have here, is a man who has close to everything, and yet close to nothing at the same time. He has more money then he knows what to do with, and he lives a life many of us can only dream about. He has it all, right? Wrong. He is deprived. He's almost a lost, tortured soul. If there's one thing Mr. Grey doesn't know how to do, it's how to love a woman. He can fall in love with a woman, but he doesn't know how to love one. The way he's built, as a person, something messed up in that brain of his, wants to dominate his partner. He's a dominant. He wants YOU to be his submissive partner. This time, however, its a little different. Mr.Grey seems to have finally connected with someone. someone he wants to get to know a little better, someone who he wants to protect. someone he wants to...dominate...still....in a love like relationship. He makes it clear what he does, and he does not want to make her uncomfortable doing this either. So the film patiently drags us through drama hell, it takes us 40 minutes into the movie before he even shows her his ""Play room"". ( And, no, sweetie, he doesn't have a X Box.) If you don't like romance, if you don't have patience, and you are not tolerable of people who think a little different, stay away from 50 Shades of Grey. And please, if you have anything bad to say about this movie, keep it off of the reviews. because we already have enough reviewers bashing this work."

","I have not read the book. This review is mostly about realism of the main characters of the movie. In some movies I notice that they really well match the logic of real life. E.g after my own divorce I noticed in some divorce-related movies that the scriptwriter certainly has observed very closely how a divorce evolves. I had similar feeling about this movie. <br/><br/>I (a boy) was abused as a sex toy by an old woman in preschool years. Based on my experience the psychological profile of main male character seems very realistic -- yes that's the way one can feel and act after abuse -- request endless weird/cruel proofs of love and still not believe. Also the female character seemed quite realistic -- compassion was driving her into the relation with that quite weird person and at same time she had quite good ability of psychological self-protection so she resisted to falling into that abyss. Of course in the movie everything is amplified.<br/><br/>I guess that one reason why many reviews say the movie is nonsense -- mostly people have not been in such situations (good for them). <br/><br/>I admit the acting could be better :-)"

To start with, it's not a piece of art, it's just another romcom, a teenager movie. And no, it's not porn, erotic scenes are very decent imho, the camera always stops before showing too much, and if someone believes teenagers nowadays would be shocked by these scenes, you don't know what you're talking about. I expected the protagonists to be lousy, yet I must confess they are convincing in their roles, and believe me I had a prejudice against them! 
I find the story be very suitable for today's young generation - in this material world obsessed with sex and false images here there are the two characters being authentic ( she is a virgin at more than twenty, no false breasts, quite common facial features, romantic, looking for the human being beyond the public image and the wealth; and him, looking for a true, ingenue and smart girl) - something unusual among the plethora of in-human movie characters.

","FIFTY SHADES OF GREY is a film every bit as bad as you've heard. The screen adaptation of the best-selling erotic novel exploring the topic of bondage, you can tell this started out as a piece of Internet fan fiction, based on the TWILIGHT saga, that became inexplicably popular. It's like a cheesy Mills & Boon romance with some unexpectedly dark subject matter involving violence against women, and yet some women seem to get a kick out of this. I don't see why.<br/><br/>As a film, this is a dog. Badly-scripted by someone with a tin ear for natural-sounding dialogue, and with embarrassingly wooden performances from the two leads. The much-hyped sex scenes feature extensive nudity and lots of athletic moments, but not once is any of it erotic or appealing. Instead it feels cheap, tawdry, and rather sleazy. I can't believe they've made sequels, either."

At least Breaking Dawn has an actual plot, but I think I've heard Fifty Shades'plot somewhere else, like, it's oozing in every adult-romance novels there is. The only difference that those chick flicks dealt with normal sexual preference instead of BDSM.<br/><br/>When I first heard about BDSM theme of the novel (haven't read it), I thought it'd be about a BDSM maniac guy and his one hell of twisted life. But, after watching the first half of the movie, I thought, ""What the hell? It's nothing twisted, it's totally chick- flick!""<br/><br/>I'm never a big-fan of chick-flicks, and it's hard to determine which one's more irrational; zombie's falling in love, sparkling- skinned vampire, or impeccably gentleman-like BDSM maniac. I think I'd opt for the last to be the most impossible. Yup, bottom line.<br/><br/>I don't understand what the big fuss people were talking about this movie. Honestly, after the first half of the movie, I practically sleeping in the second half. It's everything to be expected from a chick-flicks; a hot, billionaire, impeccable gentleman, and proper guy falling in love (well, maybe, since I never read the novels and most likely would never, thanks to this infernal movie) with an innocent young woman and (most likely) would change him someday. *yawn* It's too chick-flicks, I can barely stand it.<br/><br/>Acting aside, they're just as wooden as Kristen Stewart, everybody could see that. For me, it's nothing more than a delusional fantasy of every girl. Well, who wouldn't fall for a hot, billionaire, impeccable gentleman, and proper guy even if he's a maniac? You get a new car, new laptop, a room that you could decorate all you want, and a romantic date every weekend. And then you get to have your own personal health-monitor and not to be afraid of venereal disease when you're having 'fun' with said guy. Now, sparkling-skinned vampire becoming even more and more realistic. Blah...<br/><br/>Honestly, I prefer sparkling-skinned vampire. Sure, both guys are impeccably gentleman-like. But the vampire was consistent throughout the movie(s), while the BDSM maniac doesn't even sit well with his own contract. It's just doesn't make sense."
"Perse_phone","2","2","3","27 October 2016"," Fremdsch√§men at its very best!
","Boy, boy, boy. I don't know where to begin with this one.<br/><br/>Okay. So, did I expect much? Nope. Because I (kinda) read the 1st book of this glamorous series called ""Fifty Shades"" by one E.L. James. Morbid curiosity got the better of me... ""Kinda"" because I was very much unable to finish even the first book. To even get to the 50% mark.<br/><br/>But. I told myself that the movie had to be better. Firstly, because of Jamie Dornan, an actor who crossed my radar way before that whole train wreck of a film (and book). I really liked him. (Still do, although I hope that he won't be branded too much by the whole ""Christian Grey"" affair.) Secondly, the movie had to be better because a film couldn't possibly contain all these god-awful and painfully cringeworthy ramblings and inner monologues of one Anastasia Steele... those of her ""subconscious"" or her beloved ""inner goddess"". That brings me to thirdly (and lastly): because the script could only be an improvement of E.L. James' writing, or so I thought.<br/><br/>Well, to be totally fair, the film actually manages to not be as dreadful as the book it's based on. Kudos for that. But that doesn't mean it was good in any sense of the word. Far from it.<br/><br/>The film (same as the book) is a series of scenes of ""Fremdsch√§men"" strung together, to say the least. ""The cringeworthy"" simply never stops. The extremely cringeworthy dialogues between Christian and Ana. (Oh man, are they ever not?) The cringeworthy way Cristian Grey's stalking behaviour (and behaviour in general) gets romanticised. The cringeworthy (and wrong) portrayal of BDSM and people being into more, let's call it colorful sex. People taking home the message that Christian's general behaviour is okay because ""he's a Dom"" doesn't make it any better.<br/><br/>It's funny (or not), how Christian always says ¬ÑThat's not something I know"", ¬ÑThis is who I am"", ¬ÑThat's not how I do it"", ¬ÑYou'll like it"", and at the very same time, while arguing that he doesn't know any other way, he's trying to impose his lifestyle on Ana. A lifestyle that she knows nothing about, that is obviously very alien to her. And is not at all ""the way how she does it"" or ¬Ñwho she is"". But ¬Ñshe'll like it"", it's for her pleasure after all, according to Christian, who, strangely enough, never once considers that Ana won't, in fact, like it. The thing is, Ana is clearly not very keen or enthusiastic about the whole BDSM idea, about playing the role of being submissive (because she is only that, playing a role, or trying to, as opposed to actually being submissive). Of course in the wonderfully world fantasised by one E.L. James, she'll either learn to love it later on (in the sequels). Because of him, Christian (imagine lovey-dovey eyes). Magic d*ck, come quick. Or, Ana will cure poor Christian of his bad, bad deviancy. Because looove. Either way, both are a total bag of utter nonsense, or, you know, cr...p.<br/><br/>Oh, and don't get me started on the ""reason"" for Christian's deviant preferences. Because clearly, the only possible explanation for this kind of sexual deviance, for straying from the norm and liking BDSM and/or other fetishes has to be, gasp, an abusive childhood. Wow. Way to go, Mrs. James. Really. Chapeau. (No, wait. Are you bloody serious? ....)<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality of the characters in the film is that Ana doesn't come across as the total blubbering, naive and insecure virgin that she is in the book. Emphasis on total.<br/><br/>Also, what I don't get is (some) people being shocked at the degree of nudity in this film. Seriously? This is a film based on erotica, an erotic novel, or an erotic romance book in the very least. And it's (or wants to be) about BDSM ‚Äì a sex fetish. So (kinky) sex scenes and nudity are to be expected. Come on.<br/><br/>Well, to come to an end here: compared to the source material, this is practically a master piece. The acting is okay, as far as that is even possible considering what the actors have to work with. But compared to other films, I'm sorry to say, this was a disaster. On all counts. Ultimately, even the best actors (and writers) couldn't turn this into a grand film without throwing away the piece of rubbish that the book is and completely rewriting the story from scratch. I guess, you simply can't turn sh!!t to gold... I'm still amazed how they managed to fill two whole hours with barely anything happening."
"Hassan_Scarborough","1","2","3","18 December 2015"," Absolutely painful
","This is the reason why directors and screen writers need to refrain from deviating from the source material AND this is the reason that just because a book does well that doesn't mean that Hollywood should rush to-yet another-meal ticket to make fast money.<br/><br/>This film was agony to watch from the very beginning. This is the first film I have watched where, I wasn't completely literate of the source material, but knew enough to make an accurate assessment on how the story should progress and this film is so far from that it's not even funny.<br/><br/>I had heard that the two stars were poorly cast and that they had the chemistry of a box of cereal, and I must concur. To me even though the chemistry was bad, it's the casting of every actor in this film that's bad. I know, give the actors a chance. Not when I spend my hard earned money. I'm not a fan of this novel based series. So when my money goes into it, as with any investment, I want a return on that investment and this was just a complete waste of money and time.<br/><br/>Just absolutely painful to watch. To me the only time it's okay to deviate, even the slightest, is when the order of events are so intricate that is would be hard to condense the film down into a reasonable time frame, even if it is spread out between more than one film. I get that sometimes the person cast may not be the most accurate choice as the characters are depicted in the source and in some cases, the only choice available, but I simply don't see where that would be the case with this film.<br/><br/>Not to mention this was the lamest execution of BDSM that I have ever seen. Submissive NEVER need to be convinced. They are like that from the very beginning and voluntarily give themselves to their dominant. They already know the rules and they already have a clue as to what they want done to them. There is NEVER a negotiation. It took me out of this film entirely."
"shanemmy","5","2","3","25 May 2015"," Not the worse movie out there but disturbing when you actually think about it
","Warning : Possible spoilers OK, so i've read all 3 books. Not the greatest piece of literature but i actually liked it, although found #3 the most interesting. Considering how explicit the books were I curious to see how they would bring this to the big screen without it just turning into a Porn film. Watching the film i thought it was much over-hyped about the s%$ scenes. The scenes are very short and these days, you see just as much nudity/action on a TV show like Game of Thrones. Now, these books were written as a romance, but it's a very confusing version of romance and a very confusing understanding of BDSM. Now, the film could have been romantic ... billionaire falls for Average Jane, they fall in love and the scenes in the Glider/helicopter are a bit romantic (hey, who wouldn't want a Billionaire to sweep them of their feet and take them on a helicopter ride) But... this is no romantic film and having now watched it on Blu ray, when you watch it again, you realise how controlling Christian is over Ana and it is really disturbing to watch. I found the final scenes in the film difficult to watch. The spanking thing was not out of pleasure or some kinky BDSM thing, it was out of control and it really was hard to watch. There is no real chemistry between the stars or that they geniuinely loved one another. I can see why people are up in arms that this film promotes domestic violence. Before i saw the film, i thought that was rubbish just based on the book, but the film just seem to potray a real control freak who just thinks about hurting his girlfriend for cheap thrills. It's sad that this film tries to disguise itself as a romance or even a film about BDSM, but it barely covers that sort of stuff. It really is just a film about a messed up guy and his messed up relationship. I thought i liked this film initially but watching it again, i'm not really sure. As for the acting well, there are heaps of well known actors in this film but they get barely any screen time. So many characters from the books, quickly slotted in for a few minutes screen time with no real purpose. I like Jamie Dornan but i didn't think there was any chemistry between him and Dakota Johnson. I don't think she was a very good fit for the role. Overall, not the worse movie i've ever seen, but it is definitely a bit on the disturbing side as a disturbed romance."

","This is a movie you will never forget. Many people think this movie is bad because of all these sex scene , but actually this movie is not !! Sex scene is just part of this movie , the more important is the relationship,affection, and love story of Anastasia and Christian. Just like the director says , this movie is just like a real life fairytale. Christian is like the prince, very rich and handsome, every girl dream of. And Anastasia is the princess. This movie is just so well made. The acting between Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, the music, the scene ( Grey House,Charlie Tango, the helicopter scene, Christian Grey's Apartment,the ending,etc) it just perfectly made!! The characters acting are just so touching and full of chemistry, that when you watched it you may feel like crying(so sad the ending).

"topsi91","8","8","21","8 March 2015"," Amazing movie indeed, but I need to ask something...
","My comment include spoilers and it is my honest opinion. Be aware of the spoiler alert I am giving you. So my review of the movie is: I don't get what everyone's problem is with that movie and why many people don't like it. I don't get. I thinks it is a really good one. I love Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey. HE is the perfect for that role! I hope so much that there will have 2 more parts of the trilogy. I liked how the story is shown - not on the pervert side, like we see it in the books. I liked how Jamie Dornan's eyes are full of pain at the end, like should be with Christian Grey personality. I liked the music and etc. There are only few things I wish could be different. First, I wish the movie was longer 'cus I want to see even more details. Second, I wonder why some scenes in the trailer are missing in the movie and why some of those scenes are actually better captured in the trailers than the ones, shown in the movie.I didn't enjoy that much. And the biggest problem for me is, why some scenes are missing, some important scenes, like the one I have seen picture from, where Ana left Grey and they are in the rain - she is outside, and he is running in the rain. I want to see this scene desperately. Also, when they make love for the first time, in the trailer were shown how Jamie look Dacota, like he really want her - I wish that was included in the movie as well. Also I think could be better captured, you know.. In general I definitely adore that movie. But I wish to be shown more of the true story and by that I mean, We want to see how desperately C.Grey LOVE Ana and he can't live without her. So if you read my review, I really will be pleasant to know that in the next move /I hope there will be next movie/ you won't cut or change scenes, there will be included the scene when he finally allow Ana to touch him and etc. And for the current movie - I want to see the scene in the RAIN! PLEASE! I HOPE there will have extended version of the movie with more scenes! Do not disappoint the people who love the movie already, like I do love it still."

The first act is entirely forgettable and the last act is stuck in this weird loop of Christian and Anna making up and Christian seemingly beginning to change and then suddenly he decides not to have any character development. I wish i could say I hated watching this movie but truth be told I don't have any strong feelings about it. The only scene I really liked was funny and it wasn't unintentionally funny.

"margulanabutrlov","9","1","1","25 March 2019"," Fifty Shades Of Grey Review
","When her roommate falls ill, virginal student Anastasia Steele (Johnson) steps in to interview billionaire Christian Grey (Dornan) for her student newspaper. The pair are instantly drawn to each other and begin a whirlwind affair of pleasure and pain in front of a series of ridiculously large windows.
Arriving with all the appendages of a modern blockbuster - a Beyonc√© tie-in, a trailer YouTubed 193 million times, a LEGO parody - Fifty Shades Of Grey is one of those movies that the ""internet"" had condemned terrible, sight unseen. The truth is a little more mundane. Sam Taylor-Johnson's film of E. L. James' Twilight fan fiction-turned-phenomenon is neither so terrible to be laughable nor so brilliant to be powerful. Instead, we get a sparky first third, a rote obsessive love story, anodyne kinkiness, contentious sexual politics, slivers of skilful filmmaking and a promising turn from Dakota Johnson.
The set-up is a simple one: bookish Anastasia Steele (Johnson) meets Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), a business tycoon hiding a troubled past, a lust for BDSM (not the driving school) and a penchant for playing really miserable tunes on the piano. He lavishes his wealth on her (a first-edition Tess Of The D'Urbervilles, a snazzy red Audi) hoping she'll sign a contract to become his ""submissive"". She yearns for a more typical movie-and-a-Nando's-type relationship but tests her 'hard' and 'soft' limits anyway.
For the first 45 minutes or so, Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel play this smart. Firstly, they strip away the book's ropy language, all the ""Holy mackerel!"" this and ""inner goddess"" that. They also seem to pitch the action on two levels. The fans get their big moments - the first clinch in the lift, Grey's catchphrase, ""Laters, baby"" - but sceptics can glean the sense that the filmmakers are wise to the ludicrousness of it all. From the slick-haired secretaries at Grey House to a business meeting where the agenda includes vaginal fisting and genital clamps, the tone is playful, even flirting with satire.
But eventually the fun starts to flag. As the emotions get more intense and we begin to learn the motivations underpinning Grey's need for dominance (why can't he just be a perv?), the film gets bogged down in repetitive, earnest romantic drama. There are dull family meetings, greenhouse confessions, even a gliding sequence, something not seen in a cinema since Pierce Brosnan's heyday. The less sure-footed Taylor-Johnson's movie gets, the more insistent Danny Elfman's score becomes.
Even the naughtiness won't keep you gripped. In James' novel, there are 14 sex scenes that fetch up one flogging, two spankings, five tying-ups and 38 orgasms. The movie dials this back to four or five sexcapades. After a beautifully edited bed sesh, the antics in the infamous ""red room of pain"" are antiseptic, each visit more overblown and less sexy than the last. Peacock feathers, whips and the inventory at Tie Rack all get an outing but little of it displays any character insight or erotic edge.
Dornan looks the part but feels more befuddled than broken, failing to eat up the screen as you'd hope. Johnson, ironically, dominates. She gives Anastasia both a strength and sense of humour, be it taking the piss out of Grey (and the idea of the character) in a drunken phone call or busting little moves to Frank Sinatra's Witchcraft. She gives Fifty Shades Of Grey more colour than it has any right to have."

","Somehow I had to see this movie as I picked it up by intuition in the local library. It was full moon the night I watched it...and boy it was powerful! 
The story gripped me and I could feel the fear, lust and passion during the sexual scenes. This is not a movie about an SM relationship however...it is much more in my opinion. Especally when you watch the sequel '50 Shades Darker' and upcoming '50 Shades Freed' (february 2018).<br/><br/>Let me explain; I did a little research on the Internet and it somehow puzzled me that both the movie and the books had very bad reviews. While at the same time from the books more than 100 million copies have been sold Worldwide! It was a real hype at the time. So what is going on? 
My take on it is that somehow the author had the genius to connect with a deep collective wound that resides in all of us: sexual abuse and repression. You only have to look at the statistics; 30/ 40 % of women sexually abused...smaller percentages with men. And history books that are full of plundering gangs and armies....killing the men and raping the women. <br/><br/>I could feel the struggle and growing strength in Anastasia when she was torn between love and the feeling that the abuse was not Okay! 
And without spoil anything for new viewers...something of love continued, and the promise of the 3th movie ""50 Shades Freed"" tells you where it is going. <br/><br/>And maybe if you watch these three movies you will just like me experience some liberation from this deep rooted wound, and feel more free and trusting in your own sexual relationship. 
Looking forward to the 3th movie for sure!"

I loved this movie and I can't wait to see the other two :)"
"superdds","10","9","25","15 February 2015"," O, the movie missed the main Thrust of the book!
","The photography is stunning. The music is moving. The movie captures the overall spirit of the book. Dakota Johnson has become the real Anastasia Steele. Christian Grey's office, apartment, cars & helicopter showcase his wealth. The sex scenes were tastefully done with class. Having read the books, the plot was compelling and easy to follow. The sexual tension and interplay was captivating.<br/><br/>But, the movie completely missed what made the book so popular with its predominately female readers. As much as the viewers love the movie, there is the feeling that something has been left out from the book. Some say that the lack of character development made the movie boring. Some blame subplots that seem to go nowhere, but that's not the problem. After endless analysis and reviews, the ""Fifty Shades"" fans still can't put their finger on what's missing in the movie.<br/><br/>The book didn't sell 100 million copies because of the extraordinary plot. There are thousands of Cincerella-type stories in romance novels and fairy tales. The story of the young innocent girl coming of age with an older, wealthy, prince is not unusual. It happens all the time, both in literature, and in real life. Yawn.<br/><br/>So, what makes this book so special that it became a worldwide phenomenon? It's not the bondage. It's not the pain. It's not Christian's childhood with his resulting 50 shades of Grey. And it's not the sex. A lot of sexy books don't get translated into 52 languages. What makes this sex in this book different? Why have women in particular made ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" one of the best selling books ever?<br/><br/>Orgasms. Lots of orgasms. Lots of female orgasms.<br/><br/>For most of the book, Christian is a slow, patient, and considerate lover. He has enough experience to expertly and predictably bring women to the peak of sexual ecstasy, and maintain that that euphoria, until he pushes them over the edge, to an earth-shattering mind-blowing orgasm. Then, to the delight of the reader, he does it again and again until Anna is totally spent.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is not a single orgasm seen (or even mentioned) in the movie. A couple of times, Anastasia tilts her head back with obvious pleasure when Christian kisses her neck. The movie almost showed him kissing her panties, but quickly cut away. And, once the actual sex starts, the scene shifts to the couple lying together afterward. No screaming or moaning.<br/><br/>The book describes exactly how Christian did it. It described in great detail where he put his fingers, how he moved them, and how she responded to his touch. From Anastasia's detailed descriptions of her bodily sensations, the reader could experience her orgasms with her. You could vicariously feel the same tingling, the warmth, the wetness, the tightness, the fullness, and how Anna's full consciousness is delightfully focused right there her ""at the apex of her thighs"".<br/><br/>As Christian performed oral sex on Anastasia, the female readers can visualize how it feels, as if his tongue was pushing their own right button, so to speak. The descriptive passages may remind the reader of their own whole-body quivering orgasms of years past. Or, the reader may get some insight about orgasms that would allow them to feel the same exquisite pleasure that Anastasia felt. The reader may fantasize that their own husband or boyfriend has mastery of such skills, or that he cares to use them. <br/><br/>The movie missed the whole point of why Anna would even consider the BDSM contract. It's not because she was in love. Christian knew that, in spite of his words, the real magic happens when he takes the time to slowly build to an intense long-lasting climax. He understood the importance of savoring every delicious detail of Anna's breasts and vagina, worshiping her clitoris like never before. As the lyrics of the Pointer Sister's song ""I' so excited"" say, ""If you move real slow, I'll let it go."" In the movie, we never got to witness Anastasia letting it go.<br/><br/>Anna's own orgasm is critical to the plot of the story. For an inexperienced young woman like Anastasia, who has never has sex, who has never masturbated, and never experienced the joy of orgasm, you can see how she would never want it to end. ""I have never felt so happy in my life. I would do anything to please that man."" <br/><br/>At least 1/3 of the book is dedicated to sex that ends with Anastasia's orgasms. That explains her motivation, and also the motivations for women to purchase, read, and discuss the book. Millions of readers of the book want to feel the satisfying release that Anna felt.<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting that the movie should have shown the graphic sexual details, but the subject of orgasm could at least be simulated. Or discussed. Or even mentioned. The screenwriters missed the boat. Or the man in the boat!<br/><br/>I still give the movie a 5-star rating. It reminded me of Anna's sexual awakening that was so joyously described in the book. <br/><br/>But ""O"", it could have been so much more."

","I haven't read the book so I can't compare it to the film, but I went to the theater expecting this flick to be a real dog and I was very pleasantly surprised. I think there is a basic truth exposed here (so to speak) which is that in almost every relationship men and women have different ideas about what the ideal partner should be like--how the other should think and behave--and each is more or less frustrated when the other person fails in some way to meet that standard. I was totally engrossed in watching this theme play out in this film.<br/><br/>I don't think this is a movie for everyone, because there are some fairly explicit scenes, but having seen ""The Story of 'O'"" when it originally came out in the '70s as well as the more recent film ""Secretary"" with James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal, I wasn't shocked in the least by the short scenes of BDSM in ""Fifty Shades"". By comparison with those movies--which granted were not seen by many people since the first was a foreign film and the second was an indie film--this movie is fairly tame and the sex scenes are actually quite artistic.<br/><br/>Anastasia was really quite a strong female character. I admired that, and evidently so did Christian Grey."

","I don't know that there is anything I can say that hasn't already been said, but just in case you missed the memo, this movie depicts an abusive relationship without any of the self-awareness required to pull such a theme off. The lack of chemistry between Anastasia and Christian made for painful viewing, even when he wasn't beating the crap out of her or degrading her at every available opportunity. BDSM requires consent and loving aftercare among other things, and this movie (and the original book) fail to capture the necessity of tenderness in such relationships. I could go on, but you're better off googling this movie and seeing a detailed run-down of everything wrong with it anyway."

The innocent and naive Ana started to realize she wants him, despite his enigmatic reserve and advice, she finds herself desperate to get close to him.

"melissalouise-keen","4","6","15","13 February 2015"," I will not be awarding an A to Sam Taylor-Johnson
","Making this movie was always going to be tough job, it had a lot to live up to considering the hype of the book and it's revolutionary nature. Everyone has there own Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, so how should I review it, on the books translation to film or as a Hollywood movie. As a translation from the book, the opening sequence, the interview, probably the most critical scene in the film was lacking the sexual tension the book creates. Most of the dialogue expected from this, cut out and changed, almost beyond recognition. The scene was watchable because of Dornan, not because of the script. It was this and other vital parts such as the bath scene which were lacking in the movie. Yet, the creation of some scenes, the walk in the forest, (oh please!!!)was very much romanticising these characters.<br/><br/>The film seemed to glue scenes together into a mesh of bondage,sex hints (to call them sex scenes would be giving them too much credit) and humour but not actually touching the darkness of Christian Grey and the contrasting innocence of Anastasia Steele. Christian Grey seemed to be established as rather fluffy and misguided straight away probably so it could be deemed acceptable to a broader film audience and Anastasia Steele still managed to keep the feminists happy by making a stand against Christian Grey's lifestyle early on. Not so noticeable were the parts of Christian Grey's anatomy which were disappointingly absent in the film. Yet Anastasia Steele's female form nearer enough fully exposed.<br/><br/>As a Hollywood film, let's think where we've seen spanking before and Steven Shainberg's Secretary comes to mind. I think the intensity of the spanking lifestyle was better conveyed in that movie and perhaps Taylor-Johnson should have watched that movie for inspiration before directing this film. However, Christian Grey is a glamorous character and that is where this film excelled, the Escala set, the wardrobes were all good. This movie was constricted by guidelines for what is believed to be acceptable in the cinema and I don't think this book perhaps should ever have been a 2hr4min film. A TV adaption would have been much more effective. Television is where sexual revolutions on screen seem to be made nowadays. <br/><br/>In summary, if your a book fan, don't go see this movie. If you're looking for some entertainment and want a Christian Grey with his fluffy slippers on, then go see this movie."
"katesweetieee","10","8","22","18 March 2015"," Sadly most people don't understand this movie
","Tastes of movies obviously differ if the movie Fifty Shades of Grey received so many bad reviews. I guess people really did expect to see some hardcore porn (absolute control and screaming pain) judging by the reviews saying that the sex was too little and too tame. I never read the books , I only went to see the movie. So I guess if the book was as explicit and pornographic as people say, it is understandable that people that are into those kind of books are disappointed by the movie, which is everything BUT pornography! It is quite a serious movie with deep meaning. If you expect a violent S&M porn and instead get a serious-themed movie about the psychology of humans and what attracts us to one another. Our weaknesses and strengths in relationships and how vulnerable we are when we are in love- coupled with the deep effects trauma can have on the way we act and feel, I can see how you can be disappointed. I, on the other hand, was so happy that the wonderful director made such a great movie out of that book and thankfully saw way beyond the S&M. I can honestly say that it is the best movie I have seen in a long time. Maybe even since Pretty Woman and Titanic. What do I like about the movie? First the basics: photography, light, music, set, location are all great and create an amazing atmosphere through the picture. The way the sex scenes are depicted is a work of art; classy, erotic and romantic (all which a porn is NOT!) The plot: very deep too especially if you are able to look beyond the S&M (which sadly many people don't want to do). Just imagine you are a normal middle class girl and then the most famous, richest good looking guy in town takes interest in you. Then as you think you have found your dream come true, you start falling in love with him wishing for candle light dinners, long walks, romance etc., you find out your guy is into S&M and refuses to be romantic. It's hard for you to just say no to the relationship because you are attracted to that guy, he is so damn good looking, rich and most of all honest from the beginning which makes you feel safe. On top, you don't know S&M which makes you curious and you think: maybe he is right? And then you have the sub-plot of a traumatized boy. You can wonder: how do you become such a distant, pain- loving human incapable of romance and closeness? And can such a person truly fall in love? He has probably never known true love so he sticks to what he knows: pain and dominance. Can she ""heal"" him from that? Should she ""heal"" him from that? And this is not to suggest that all people who prefer S&M are psychologically sick but Christian surely is. Wow. Deep topic. Amazing topic. The characters: I think ""the distance between the characters"" that everyone keeps seeing is necessary to support the plot and I am sure it was wanted this way and did not happen because the actors had their real lovers on their minds (seriously?). Christian is that way for a reason, he has never learnt to be close and romantic¬Öhow can he then show that side and yet be dominant? And yet there are moments when Ana gets that a little bit out of him and those rare moments are the special ones I think. Those are the fifty shades I suppose which I can imagine are a lot clearer in a long book than in a short movie. But a traumatized person doesn't just change 180degrees because he meets a girl he likes. Especially in such a short time. Plus there must be distance between them. There is the S&M between them. I think this ""stiffness"" and ""lifelessness"" is what suits this movie 100% and it is what makes it mysterious and great. It makes you think and wonder and this IS chemistry. But of course, if you expected porn, then you shall be disappointed. It is just amazing and sad that professional reviewers don't want to or are not able to see the greatness of this picture. The psychology in every frame of every shot. In picture, sound and acting. Everything so thought through. In my opinion, Oscar to Sam Taylor- Wood! <br/><br/>PS. Shame she won't be doing the sequel just because so many people want to see trashy, cheap, porn."
"guptilla1480","10","8","22","7 March 2015"," Good movie
","I thought it was a very good movie. I think the actors acted how the book intended, and I think that if you weren't too shallow to get lost in the storyline that it also had a great storyline. A lot of people probably didn't like it because they were expecting an all out porno and didn't think to bring their brain to the show. If you pay attention, there are subtle hints as to what's going on and why. I've seen some people say that he ""raped"" her, and the only scene I can think of that being even close to the case is where he used his belt and she cried, but if you pay attention, she wasn't crying from physical pain but because she was mad that all he wanted was to hurt her and not have any sort of a relationship. If you've read the book, thats IMPORTANT later because you find out WHY he wants to hurt BRUNETTES, (the other 15 girls that slept in that room) So since I paid attention I found this to be an excellent movie to watch."

Both actors play well even though I read many bad comments about Jamie D I think he played his part very well, he is supposed to be weird, he is supposed to be different and with many characters. That's why she is confused by him. The only recommendation for the producers is that they need to do a better part on linking parts and pieces- not everyone reads the books. I do think that would be helpful if they did some kind of explanation on how much time has passed or what she or he is thinking in the meanwhile.

However, I would recommend reading the books first or at least the first book so as to get an idea of the magnitude of the love story, the emotions, the flamboyance, and the fragility of the characters and how they are so beautiful for one another. Be wary of the trash talkers of the story of 50 shades, clearly most of them are narrow minded and or they haven't even read the books or seen the movie. However, like it love it or hate it.

For any readers like me, we will go to watch this movie no matter how low the rating is. In fact, I can't even remember when was the last time I felt strongly about having to watch a movie on its first day of release.<br/><br/>Secondly, the movie is pretty true to the book, and I am glad the director Sam Taylor-Johnson didn't make it like a porn movie but rather an artsy one. Dakota Johnson did a fabulous job. After watching this movie, I'm sure everyone will agree that she's really Anastasia Steele coming out from the book. I look forward to seeing her career taking off from here. As for Jamie Dornan, he's doing a pretty good job too. But the thing is, I don't think anyone can really portray Christian Grey. It's not just his look, but also his strong characters, i.e. intense and intimidating, but in the meantime...desirable. So I think it's fair to say that Jamie Dornan has done the best he could, and I enjoyed watching his performance. I also want to mention that Eloise Mumford as Kate Kavanagh is a scene stealer. She left a strong presence every time she was on the screen.<br/><br/>Finally, Beyonc√©'s song ""Crazy in love"" went really well with the red room play...<br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie deserves much better than 3.3..."

Interesting to see Christian develop as the movie progresses and get little glimpses into how his childhood has impacted on the person he has become in adulthood. Also felt that Dakota Johnson was perfect as Anastasia and did a great job portraying the insecure nature of her character as well as her inner struggle regarding the fate of her relationship. I am disappointed by the links made by some people in the media between this film and domestic violence.

","Listen, I don't think anyone was expecting this to be cinematic greatness. The source material is horribly written and the dialogue is awkward. That being said, I hated the casting in the trailer, but both actors grew on me during the film. There isn't really a plot to the movie, it's essentially just about the relationship between C&A, so if you go in expecting a dramatic story with a splash of BDSM then you'll be disappointed. I felt like the movie was well done and the female director took care in showing a controversial topic. I'm not sure why people who are anti-BDSM would see the movie, other than to stand on a soapbox and declare we are all morally bankrupt. However, with the limited knowledge of the BDSM community I possess, this is very far from an accurate depiction of a true Dom/Sub relationship. In the real situation, the sub has all of the power and she (or he) is allowing things to happen and respect of the word No or Stop is at the forefront of this lifestyle. While wholly improbable a naive 21 year old virgin would get involved in BDSM, I think it's important to watch the character progression, particularly of Christian. People are uncomfortable with the ""abuse"" and quickly leap to judgment of the spanking etc, but the gentle feathers and light spanks are done for pleasure."

She isn't quite as needy in the book, verbally. People have been rather harsh on this trilogy because the media only wants to publish the sex and not the actual plot. The actual story, the love story, part of it all is quite touching in hoping that we can meet that one person who can change everything we thought we knew about ourselves and at the same time helps us move on from pain we have experienced. Keep in mind this is only the first movie in a three part series (or 4 if they break the last book up). So saying that this sucked and what a horrible ending blah blah blah, would be like saying at the first Lord of the Rings(fellowship of the ring) was just a waste of time, in which many people did think so until the other two Lord of the Rings came out. I urge people to give it a chance because as the story progresses it becomes less about sex and more about there feelings for each other. I loved this movie. It was great to see something I had only imagined on a screen and not just in my head. Stop focusing so much on the fact that there is nudity(we are adults get over it) and try focusing on the plot and for everything that is good in this world read the damn books first. END RANT."

","Let me start off by clarifying that I watched 50 Shades not with the sole intent of bashing nor adoring it. I knew what kind of book it and its series was. I went in for the cinematic experience and to feed my curiosity: can a garbage book produce a good movie? The answer to that question is no. <br/><br/>My biggest problem was the pacing. Nothing substantial happened for the longest time (this is what happens when you have a meek person - no confrontation, no substantial drama for the LONGEST time). I kept waiting for any climax, plot-wise, mind you, and it did occur! Right at the very end, but at that point, I didn't really care one iota for either Ana or Christian. I was too busy nodding off. People who went into this for a lovey-dovey Valentine's Day 2015 had another thing coming. What would have normally constituted the MIDDLE or TWO-THIRDS of a romance movie, constituted the end. Why? Because the execs like their sequels and so does 50 Shades' author, E. L. James. It's all about milking that cash cow.<br/><br/>Ideally, this would all end here, so the message it could get across is one that condemns, rather than condones, stalking and abusive behavior. Unfortunately, 50 Shades spent far too many minutes building up an idolizing portrait of Mr. Grey and his fancy schmancy lifestyle for it to have come across as that. It can't even be passed off as effective satire.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Jamie as Christian was wooden. The guy was likely working on perfecting the American accent (which, sorry, did not happen) or feeling foolish without his beard. In his defense, he has the creepy vibe down-pat, probably from playing a serial killer in The Fall. The same can't be said of Dakota. Her Ana was just as I imagined her to be. It takes skill to play so daft a character.<br/><br/>If you're looking for racy content, you're better off watching TV series like Game of Thrones, Outlander, or dare I say, Sex and the City. The movie takes so long to address Mr. Grey's kinky side, you'll have forgotten the real reason you're tuning into 50 Shades in the first place.<br/><br/>2/10 because the dialogue could have been more cringe-worthy (no inner goddess, subconscious telling me all the things, not even a mention of fifty shades!), Dakota at least tried, and the music saved me from complete slumber. So yes, it could have actually been worse. Instead, it was just a really bad movie, regardless of the source material. 50 Shades does not stand on its own feet as a movie. Whether that's a good or bad thing is another question entirely."

","I cannot believe I persevered with this truly dire film, hoping at some point it would redeem itself. No such luck unfortunately, minutes of my life I'll never get back. The leads had zero charisma or chemistry, and with such a poor script I guess it's no surprise, so the writers can shoulder some of the blame.<br/><br/>Really speaking though, while it would have been somewhat predictable casting 'known' more suitable leads, it would have at least made things a tad more bearable. I suppose the dilemma is finding Hollywood 'A-list's', that are willing to gamble their career. <br/><br/>Anyway to sum it up: creepy, icky, awkward, unconvincing, z-movie, lame, wooden, worse than 'Show Girls' (rating-wise; as I thankfully haven't seen that pile of poo), actors & film crew who must've thought OMG have I really involved myself in such an embarrassingly bad project (oh heck at least I'm getting paid loads), Thunderbirds puppets delivered lines more convincingly and had oodles more presence, worse accents than Dick Van Dyke (""Chitty bang-bang, chitty chitty bang-bang!"" üòÅ), unsexy, not a jot of romance, more cringe worthy than watching your folks getting frisky.

She did just that. Even the author agrees that the books are badly written. She says that she is normally more disciplined. Also as someone in the BDSM lifestyle, everything is so wrong about what is done. The playroom is awesome though but for instance the knot tying around her wrists is done with a very lazy knot that is not secure and can tighten done to easily cutting of blood flow.

Screw the plot, this is a movie based on a book, if you wanna rate the plot, rate the book. <br/><br/>Anyway, I gave this six stars, but I haven't really decided fully on how I feel about the movie. So, of course there's a lot of things missing from the book, but they did a pretty good job with keeping in the essentials scenes. <br/><br/>The cast, well first of I think that Jamie Dornan is a handsome man, and it is pretty hard to find an actor that everybody finds attractive, so just go with it, they aren't going to change him because you don't like him. But I can see what you guys say, when you're talking about the lack of chemistry between the leading characters and since this is very important, it downgrades the movie a bit. <br/><br/>I like that Dakota Johnson isn't the most hot, sexy and perfect woman, because that's not how Anastasia Steele is described. They are following the book quite well, and that's very pleasing because too many times has a movie destroyed a book. Christian is a very complex person to portray and many people may not be happy with the way Jamie played him, hell maybe I aren't happy about it, but there is so many haters in here, who just wants to hate because they can. And I know that everything this movie (book) is showing/telling is horrible. The way their relationship is.. It is just wrong, and nobody should want to be in a relationship like that, but to be fair they had to agree to it. Safewords and all. So you can't say that it's wrong, you might think it's wrong, but both people are agreeing to it. <br/><br/>Anyway, back to the movie.

Jamie is not intimidating in the least and brings none of the complexity to the character. Dakota has none of the personality or innocence to portray Anastasia. The movie doesn't show you any feeling or motivation, and the story is packed full of feelings. The sequel will be odd because I didn't see in this movie where these two cared about each other at all.

","I have read all the books and was simply amazed with the movie. A lot of people who have not read the book will never understand the story behind the movie and give unfair reviews.<br/><br/>I think a lot of controversy surrounds the fact that a man is hitting a woman and yeah there is sex involved big surprise. If people only read the book you would know that was coming. This movie is not about domestic violence, remember the character agreed to doing the things that Christian Grey wanted to do to her. She asked for it! The books tell the story of why Christian Grey is the way that he is, there is more of a story to tell. What is shown in this movie the 1st book is about Christian's world and it's setting up the story line for the other books/movies.<br/><br/>Even though I loved the movie I found that the story was kind rushed by skipping pieces of the book and I can see how some scenes could lose people, for example where they were drinking wine out of flowered tea cups instead of wine glassed, it was because she had just moved and she had the proper glasses still packed. Or the photo shoot Christian Grey offered photo's for Anastassia's roommate and all of a sudden they are in a photo shoot. What happened that lead up to that, was left out and again could confuse a viewer who hadn't read the book.<br/><br/>For those who are apposed the S&M in this movie really should have gone to see another movie or read the book first as this is not for everyone. There are Disney type movies that might be better suited for your viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>I thought the actors did a wonderful job although in the book Christian Grey had blue eyes not brown. I hope in the future movies that they incorporate more of the book into the movie and not rush it. Even if they had to do a part one and part two, it would be well worth it as this movie was excellent.<br/><br/>Will I watch the other movies absolutely looking forward to it.

"atomic-cocktail-ent","2","4","9","18 February 2015"," No Shades of Humanity
","So I finished watching the dreaded - and dreadful - Fifty Shades of Grey. It really was a struggle to get through this movie. I only read part of the first book and thought it was problematic due to the Domestic Abuse that happens throughout the story. Although it has been somewhat toned down for the movie, it still remains the same.<br/><br/>I'll go through the Pros first. The cinematography, wardrobe, lighting, set direction, and soundtrack (with the exception of Ellie Goulding) was top notch. However, the old adage, ""You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear"" really is true in this case. Everything was very sleek, modern, and sophisticated, almost sterile, recalling Mickey Rourke's office and apartment in 9 1/2 Weeks, but on Steroids. <br/><br/>The Cons are everything else. Dakota Johnson's acting was probably the closest to being the most competent out of everyone and she seemed close to being human in the few moments where she asserted herself and stood up to Grey (which I wish there were more of). She did have little bits of humor I thought were cute. Otherwise, she constantly bit her lip (the Ana character also does this a lot in the book), which was annoying. Once or twice would have been okay, but it was distracting. She constantly had this sickly, unhealthy look in her eyes and face. She is supposed to be vulnerable, but there's a difference between vulnerable and just plain weak - she was definitely the latter, whether consciously or unconsciously. <br/><br/>Jamie Dornan fared less well. His Irish accent slipped out a few times and he seemed like he was reading through his lines instead of truly emoting or becoming Christian Grey. Not that Christian Grey is a human enough character anyway, or anyone else in this film, for that matter. My biggest problem with this film (other than the Domestic Abuse) is none of the characters seem real or true to life. The dialogue was weak, awkward, and stilted. It did not flow naturally like real dialogue is supposed to sound. Everyone, including the lead actress (although she was the most ""human""), was very two-dimensional. When you watch a film, you want to feel like you're going through the character's emotions and struggles, you want the couple to get together, to overcome their problems and obstacles. That just wasn't here in this film. I struggled to make sense of why these two people even get together in the first place. In real life, I would've gotten a restraining order on this guy, no matter how ""hot"" or rich he is. There are several instances in which stalking takes place. She asks for space constantly and he never gives it to her. I could go on, but you get the (twisted) picture.<br/><br/>As far as the sex itself (which is what many people have raised a fuss about), it's nothing to write home about, although it was tastefully presented. This movie is surprisingly vanilla for a hot-button topic like BDSM. You will not see real BDSM in this film. I would suggest seeing a classic erotic film like The Story of O, 9 1/2 Weeks, Belle du Jour, or something more recent like Secretary. I have seen more explicit sex watching Cinemax at 1:30 in the morning. It was nothing groundbreaking. The sex scenes seemed more like music videos than anything. Ana doesn't even have an orgasm. For a movie that was made and produced by women, it seriously shows a lack of demonstrating to women how female pleasure should be presented on the screen.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the lack of chemistry between Johnson and Dornan. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but I have seen lots of cinematic on-screen couples with far more heat. There were moments when there is an obvious lack of chemistry such as the scene where a photographer takes their picture at Ana's graduation ceremony. When the same picture shows up in a copy of a newspaper later on in the film, it is obvious the two clearly dislike each other (on and off the screen).<br/><br/>Honestly, this movie was very depressing and although I made fun of it in the beginning, toward the end I felt uncomfortable and disturbed. Even though I didn't pay for it, I felt guilty that I even watched it, even out of curiosity. This is not empowering to women and it is not a relationship anyone should aspire to. Yes, I realize it was a fantasy that E.L. James created based on Twilight fan fiction. Of course you must have a suspension of disbelief whenever you watch any film, but in this case I could not. Money and power does not excuse the fact that abusive relationships can and do exist. Real life Anas haven't been so lucky. Many of them end up in shelters, on the run and in hiding, or dead. <br/><br/>Does this mean anything in this movie could cause people to abuse others? Not necessarily, no. But if anything else I hope something like this starts a discussion about how we should help Domestic Abuse and Domestic Violence victims get on the road to living a better life. I hope women realize a relationship with a controlling man, no matter how materially generous of physically attractive he may be, is destructive and unhealthy. I hope this inspires other filmmakers out there to make better films that show sexuality in the context of a healthy, happy relationship. That's what I hope people get out of this above all else."

","Let me start by saying this film is critically awful. The script is laughable and the whole Christian Grey character just reminds me of a spoiled rich child who constantly wants his own way (I expected him to throw a tantrum every time Anastasia turned him down).<br/><br/>However, going into the cinema and expecting this to be the worst thing ever created in human history, I found that I actually quite enjoyed it. The script is so bad that's it's funny and I thought the two main actors did well with what they had to work with. But whoever hired that writer and cast Rita Ora (though she was only in it for, what, 15 seconds?) needs to be kicked out of Hollywood!<br/><br/>Moving on to the sex scenes...honestly, I've seen worse in True Blood and Game of Thrones. There isn't anything particularly graphic and there's nothing that will make viewers feel uncomfortable (unless they've never seen an R rated movie).<br/><br/>I know people are slating this movie for ""raping their intelligence"" and so on, but just go in with an open mind and a light heart knowing that it's not going to be Academy nominated or Oscar worthy (more like a Razzie winner) and you'll probably get a kick out of it.

It's not that I think that all chick flicks are bad, but when it comes to making and promoting film for a women audience, then the executives of the production company are probably not going to put a lot of effort into. They'll simply look at When Harry met Sally, Love Story, and Pretty Woman and slap together what they think works. <br/><br/>So more then often, movie studios will turn to romance novels as a quick way to make more movies for women. The setups are very similar; a woman who wants more out of life meets a mysterious man who changes their perspective and then something comes in between that will tear the two apart only for one of then to realize that they were wrong and get back together and live happily ever after. The Twilight franchise is probably the most obvious example, yet is one of the most successful of the chick flicks. Now we go from vampires to¬Ösubmission erotica in Fifty Shades of Grey. <br/><br/>Fittingly enough, we open in the grey Seattle where Ana Steele (played by Dakota Johnson) is filling in for her journalism major friend to conduct an interview a young corporate executive, Christian Grey (played by Jamie Dornan). The interview starts out awkward, but the young stud seams to have interest in the young innocent. She encounters him again ad the hardware store she works at and asks her to a coffee shop outing. Though she initially leaves, he goes as far to send her a first edition of a Thomas Hardy novel to show his interest in her. <br/><br/>She still seams resilient to his advances until he takes her home after getting a phone call from a drunken Ana. When he doesn't take advantage of her, the two start dating and the two seem pretty good. This all comes to a halt when Christian reveals that he has a hobby on the sidelines¬Öbondage. Yep, he's into the handcuffs, whips, and other naughty things that shock Ana at first, but agrees to go with. She signs a non disclosure contract and agrees with Christian that they are playing and not ""sleeping together"". <br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey sounds more like a soft-core porn story then a genuine movie. Though the hard R rating is well earned, I don't know if I say that it went as far as it could have gone. I have seen erotica dramas that are far better (like Last Tango in Paris and Chloe) and most people have already gone as far to call this a waste of time even before it was released. It came and gone and honestly, it could have been worse. <br/><br/>Oh it's badly written (I mean laughably bad dialogue bad), but I can tell that director Sam Taylor-Johnson tried her hardest to make this more thrilling then anything.<br/><br/>Dakota Johnson has a lot of talent. So does Jamie Dornan. The two have genuine chemistry and try their hardest to make some bad writing work. It doesn't even come close though I still applaud their effort. The novel of the same name, from what I'm told, is just as empty and bland, but the production seems to want to make this work. I'm clearly not the target audience, but I think that the same audience who loves the book will still like this<br/><br/>There's not much else to say other then it had an odd ending that seems to only set up for a sequel. It'll probably receive one, but it's not on my pleasure list.<br/><br/>I'll give this four sexy handcuffs out of ten. Some people are really outraged by this project coming to the big screen, but its something I can live with."
"barbies_kwl","8","4","9","17 February 2015"," Amazing
","Amazing film. Don't know what people expected really as you can't get everything from the book in a 120 minute film. Although some parts from the book<br/><br/>were missed out that I expected would of been put into the film but then again you can only put so much in. If you want all the details then you should of read the book really!<br/><br/>I personally think they chose the correct bits from the book to go into the film, and it was an easy story to follow if you are one of the minority who hasn't read the book before the film. Although a bit gutted that 'vanilla' was not included. Found It very funny in some parts and thought the characters were well matched to the actors/actresses. Looking forward to seeing how 'Fifty Shades Darker' will come out. Can't wait for It to come out!!"
"carmat79","6","4","9","17 February 2015"," better than expected
","I enjoyed the books In a guilty pleasure kind of way but they were no great works of literature . I did wonder how on earth they might make it into a movie without it being a full on porno . I think the succeeded in getting the essence of the story without it being to graphic In fact maybe it was toned down a bit much to the point it wasn't even very sexy. I thought the leads were going to be terrible but I didn't come out hating them or the movie so that was a bonus. overall it was enjoyable but no wow factor I will see the next movies when they come out without dreading it to be the train wreck I was expecting."
"lazlips2003","9","4","9","16 February 2015"," Perfect Balance
","It is visually brilliant. Locations and cinematography all well done. It has a perfect balance between the sex and the relationship. The book describes almost every sexual encounter they have but you cant have it all in the film, otherwise yes then it would be edging on pornographic. Especially the tampon scene. Lol! The sex scenes were great if your not a prude and Jamie Dornan plays a very sexy and convincing Christian. I liked how they built the story between Ana and Christian. The acting in the beginning seemed a bit dodgy but it got better throughout the film. Cant say the same for the other characters in the film though. I'm glad they were not in the film much. Ana's drunk phone call was hilarious and very well done. As this is a trilogy book adaption it has an unsatisfying ending because you seem to only had a brief glimpse into their relationship together. I guess this is because you can't wait until the next instalment! Lol! For someone who has read the books I am really pleased with this film adaption. It really brings the books to life! Roll on 2016!"

"simona-meow","9","4","9","16 February 2015"," Great movie if you've read the books
","I understand some people are upset with this movie just because they haven't read the books. It shouldn't be that hyped up and marketed but it kind of was a really smart move. Firstly, this movie was made for all the fans who have read the books and have been wanting to see it come alive on the screen. Everyone's imagination of Christian is different and you can't please everyone so they really tried hard. Anastasia is perfect though. I do agree it should be longer and more concise, but it totally satisfied my wishes and my imagination with a lot of similarities from the book. Totally loved how they put in more humor and it was just fun to watch. Please, read the books firstly and you'll probably love the movie. Also, the music was nicely incorporated in some of the scenes. I missed Ms. Jones though. A lot of people still compare it to Twilight, though that one was bad but i still kind of liked it."
"jzbmill","8","4","9","16 February 2015"," Better than expected
","After reading all of the bad reviews this movie got, I went in to it with low expectations and actually thought the movie was better than I had hoped. I loved the book series and I thought the movie was well done for a 2 hour movie. The actors and actresses were as I had pictured from the book and there was as much sex appeal as is probably allowed for it not to be x rated! I had my doubts as other reviewers about the choice of the actors but they worked for this movie and had great on screen chemistry. Of course the books were better than the movie because there is a lot more details that were left out but overall well done! I only hope the next one in the series comes out sooner than later!"
"changeswillcome-7","9","4","9","16 February 2015"," 50 Shades of Grey : is not for everyone
","I saw the Movie 50 Shades of Grey last night by myself on a huge imax screen :) : I liked the movie story & yeah .... naked guy with a 'healthy body' he works out just a little without using 'steroids'; yuck! that's my opinion. is my (of course that is my opinion) knew the movie would get 'bad' reviews while I was watching it. I could feel the uncomfortable vibrations of people around me. This movie is not for everyone. <br/><br/>Yet I know how opinionated people are too. Not everyone is going to 'understand' the point to this movie; meaning not everyone is on the same levels of understand or have same interest & experiences in their life. I think the reviews are harsh and very critical. It's nothing like a porno: seriously; like Wow! Story has a deeper meaning and it's called 'Think' deeply past the 'ego' and experience life. I don't listen to reviews or based my opinion on reviews: I think and feel for myself. This is not just about 'sex' yet would take a person with an open mind and deep insight to understand the point the writer was making: not everyone would be capable of understanding. Not everyone is a perfect actor or actress: If people expect these people to be Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie : well then don't go see it: of course it's not the NoteBook: it's not suppose to be. Just saying .... I liked the movie for my own special reasons :) Respect"
"Mylie123","8","4","9","16 February 2015"," Was good but it could have slightly been better
","I personally feel that the heavily negative reviews are coming from people who haven't read the book and have expected heavy sexual content in regard to people's perspective of fifty shades of grey. Watching the film the other day, i noticed there are moments where you wouldn't understand why or how certain things are happening if you didn't read the book. For example, Ana's reaction to the books wasn't towards the fact that Christian bought them for her, but the fact that they were $14,000 each. For me the film portrayed key aspects of the book but obviously what you read is not always directly portrayed the exact same way on screen. I adored the way Dakota and Jamie took on their roles and i feel that the storyline has gotten people confused. <br/><br/>Instantly people assume the film to have very kinky sex on top of a lot of genital showing, but the idea of the film is to show the build up of romance between Ana and Christian and that Christian has been a very dominant man for all his life until Ana comes a long and that both their perspective of things are shared with each other. What people don't understand is the kinky sex is Christians way of dealing with specific issues and emotions and that Ana is the key to unlock this and gets him to gradually start releasing these positive emotions, realising that there is more to life that what it is that he is doing. Ana allows Christian to open up and actually love which is the key point people are missing with this film. Hence why Christian had 'vanilla' sex (normal sex) with Ana in his bed which was the first time he has ever done that with woman. <br/><br/>The reviews would be a lot higher if people managed to understand the storyline better and had less of these artificial expectations of the book through gossip. FINGERS CROSSED FOR A SEQUEL!"
"cynthfair","7","4","9","15 February 2015"," Not as bad as being made out to be
","I'll start with this - don't go in expecting Gone With the Wind (movie) or a film adaptation of a classic such as Grapes of Wrath - you won't get it. Tone down your expectations. Going to follow with this - unlike many other reviewers who had an axe to grind from the outset (if you think the book sucks, wth are you even going to the movie adaptation???), I do not. Read the books, don't consider then Pulitzer material but then I also don't think they were such trash that I've read better first grade essays. The acting was okay, by the end you can buy both of the leads in their roles. The plot, well see above. The material - honestly if you have an issue with it, you should never have read the book OR saw the movie. In the end this movie will appeal to certain demographics and others were going to trash it no matter what. Many of the ""issues"" being protested about the movie are flat-out wrong and people are reading far too much into it and the book and can't get past their own issues. I'd say if you can go in with an open mind you won't feel like you wasted your money or time - just don't go in with a minor."
"maria_gr79","7","4","9","15 February 2015"," what i expected
","I read all 3 books and liked them. The movie was more or less what i expected. We should all keep in mind that hard core sex scenes could not be put in a Hollywood movie that wants to make money, so in a two hour film there should be unfolded 3 things: the (complicated) personalities, the love story and some BDSM sex that doesn't offend the big crowd but doesn't disappoint the fans of the book either. This said, all 3 things could be done better. During the movie I had the feeling that everything was happening too fast in order to fit in a little bit of everything. Like there was no time for explanations! It was important to be clear in the movie that the main connection between the couple came from the fact that Ana was a virgin and because of that Cristian became obsessive over her. ""You are mine"" is what made it difficult for him to let go of her and yet it was completely gone from the movie. For someone who haven't read the book, it made no sense why Cristian look devastated when he lost her. Overall, it could have lasted half or even an hour longer and explain better some important details or give time and film better some sex scenes! I liked the 2 main actors, but the rest of the cast was not good."
"stamfragk98","4","4","9","15 February 2015"," Disappointing.
","First of all, I gave this film a rating of 4/10 and this is not because I'm the typical male viewer who despises this film just because it's a chick's film and I'm not your typical female viewer who hates this film because well, let's face it, it sucks... I actually gave it such a low rating because having read the book, and even though I wasn't such a big fan of the series; I mean the reason I started reading was out of curiosity... Anyway, I didn't like the book, I don't hate it, but then again I don't love it either... But, if the book was kinda annoying then this film is the epitome of boring! Why such a fuss when the sex scenes aren't that shocking, the acting is below average and the plot, well... Everything happens way too fast and from my point of view, it does get boring. Not an amusing film... Personally, I would recommend this to people who are just curious to see what this is about, (definetely not to its books fans) and to any dump couple who wants to play naughty. 4/10 Please don't waste your time."
"tamarahkirton","4","4","9","13 February 2015"," Better than the book, but that isn't saying much...
","I went into this with fairly low expectations. I have read all three of the books, the first one was passable, by the second and third the writing was so awful that it was laughable.<br/><br/>The two main characters are cast pretty well, there was some chemistry which worked for the most part aside from when they were in the bedroom or playroom. <br/><br/>The sex scenes are almost cringe worthy and somewhat lacking given the premise. It didn't help that the audience of the cinema was nearly all comprised of middle aged women (acting like a bunch of annoying teenagers) who were there on a girl's night out.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are shockingly one dimensional. Ana's flatmate is as close to a 'real' person but even she is woefully lacking. <br/><br/>Mercifully the film has skipped over / cut out a lot of the far more annoying bits of the novel but it doesn't really seem to get off the ground. <br/><br/>There are quite a few lines delivered in the film which the audience interpreted as humour, but I doubt they were all intended that way. <br/><br/>Not bad for a film that has origins of Twilight fan faction, but I don't think I'll be rushing out to see the second and third adaptations. At least, not on opening night. I have already promised my other half that I will under no circumstances make him sit through those too.<br/><br/>5/10 for effort, (it should really be a 4.5). Most of that is for the soundtrack and a nod to the director who managed to make a not utterly terrible film given the source material."
"elena_ataur","10","8","23","5 March 2015"," I really liked it contrary to the sadistic sexual scenes (most have been cut anyway)
","Although many said to me not to watch the movie, I did. And I must say I did not feel disappointed at any moment. The chemistry between the two leads is amazing, and setting aside the whole sadistic sexual scenes, I do believe that there was a lot of intensity and the plot was actually quite deep. I would watch it again for sure. <br/><br/>Some compare it with twilight, although I don't know why as we are talking about different plots thus I see no resemblance other than the fact that both male leads where born in May. <br/><br/>Anyways, I would suggest to watch this movie it really does worth watching. The whole concept of two polar opposite characters to be drawn to each other like magnets works really good and it can suit any style of romantic."
"natalievoss9","10","8","23","15 February 2015"," get a grip on yourself
","The movie does not at all degrade women ?? I honestly don't know what everyone is ob about. All Grey does is whip her and normal everyday people who practise BDSM have done worse than that. If it's not your thing, don't degrade the movie since it is not bad. The movie as such is well done with Music and all and also exemplifies that Grey is not into the (Huge tits and ass) but of course no one mentions that. The movie is filled with passion and some people should stop complaining that it doesn't make them wet cause they think Dakota has no sex appeal. all in all good movie with a great cliffhanger for those who haven't read the books"
"facebook-239-881268","1","8","23","14 February 2015"," Very good book, awful movie
","I am a big fan of the book trilogy. The director Sam Taylor Johnson did an amateur work. There is more sexual tense in Gone with the wind between Rhett and Scarlett than in 50 shades of Grey. We can not see any feelings between Anastatsia and Christian. The film is showing unrelated scenes without any transitions. This is as if the director would have taken out of the book some chapters without being able to link them. Jamie Dornan is unable to show any feeling. We can neither see on his face nor on his body how attracted he is to his partner. He is spoiled.<br/><br/>We started a petition to stop the damages. It would be a shame if she would be allowed to direct the adaptations of the two other novels."

","The emperor has no clothes. Or rather he does, they're just really really dull.<br/><br/>Behold the sexploitation film. The bottom of the barrel in exploitation sub genres. And it's a deep barrel! Sexploitation is just one step short of outright porn. Except sexploitation doesn't rate as high a porn. At least pornography gratifies its audience. But 'Fifty Shades' doesn't even rate as high sexploitation.<br/><br/>Behold the great American novel, the bottom of the barrel in print. Based on the recent successes of 'Twilight' and 'The DiVinci Code' and 'The Hunger Games' (the first novel to ever advertise itself as being plagiarized) the American reader is dumb as rocks. Raised on 'Sweet Valley High' and 'The Babysitters' Club' the American reader cannot be expected to comprehend any type plot, character development, or writing prose. It has to be dumbed down, mashed up, and spoon fed to them.<br/><br/>When I first heard about the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' novels I was just as much up for (no puns intended) some good erotic fiction as any other reader. I read the first twenty pages of a bootleg version before I fell asleep. To sum it up in a single word it was ""juvenile."" It read like stereo instructions, as if the words had merely been randomly assembled by a computer program rather than a typing monkey.<br/><br/>The mere names of the characters are laughable. Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele? Seriously? Were the names Hester Prynne and Seymour Butts already taken? How can any reader take this seriously after reading those names? <br/><br/>The setting is equally as cardboard. An office. Move over 'Claiming of Sleeping Beauty' this erotic novel takes place in an office.<br/><br/>So no matter what your personal tastes the last thing you want anything to be is boring. That's what 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is, boring and juvenile.<br/><br/>Then came the media sensation! The novels were plugged left and right as being ""erotic"" and ""controversial."" As I already stated they're as ""erotic"" as stereo instructions and the claim of controversy would be more convincing if these novels weren't SOLD AT THE CHECKOUT LINE IN GROCERY STORES!!! Come on! How ""controversial"" can it be? <br/><br/>Finally last night I chose to embrace the horror and get it over with and finally watch a bootleg version of this movie. How bad could it possibly be? I figured, if I could endure 'Cannibal Holocaust' 'Cannibal Ferox' 'Riki Oh' 'Salo' and ALL THREE 'ILSA' movies I could certainly survive this.<br/><br/>I braced myself (no puns intended) for this ""controversial"" ""shocking"" ""erotic thriller"" which barely got an R rating to see..... bare breasts. That's right! The most shocking scenes in the movie feature bare breasts. That's it!!! That's the big ""shocker!"" Bare breasts! Dakota Johnson's flat as a board bare breasts. I can name PG movies that feature bare breasts! <br/><br/>Staying true to the novel it was boring as sin. Well I guess I should have expected as much.<br/><br/>This only reinforces what I've said all along. Who is the target audience here? There's no shortage of actual porn. And porn fans will be bored to tears. The only way they'd enjoy this is if the role of Anastasia Steele was played by Tanner Mayes and the role of Christian Grey was played by ten black men.<br/><br/>At the same time other people won't be interested in seeing this trash. So who was the target audience to begin with? <br/><br/>'Fifty Shades' is pure hype built on nothing. The emperor has no clothes. Or rather he does, they're just really really dull.<br/><br/>I was very saddened to learn that this film was produced by Michael De Luca. The Michael De Luca? The same screen writer of one of the greatest films ever made 'In The Mouth of Madness'? Now I hate 'Fifty Shades of Grey' even more!"
"zbtasnets","9","3","6","1 July 2015"," Don't know what is BDSM - you wont like this movie
","To all of those who doesn't know what BDSM and Dominant/Submissive relationships are: this movie shows domestic violence. I agree but if you want to know why this story/movie is not about domestic violence keep reading (SPOILER ALERT). At first to all ¬Ñnormal"" people story goes like this. A rich guy basically lures young female into his sex and bondage acts because HE likes it. And then the female agrees, story evolves, and in the end female cries and leaves the relationship because this cruelty isn't her thing. That's about it. Now lets look at the movie from Dom/Sub perspective with the drama that holds the story going. The rich guy was abused when he was young. A slightly older woman seduced him into her webs and made him fall in love with Dom/Sub scene. (Now this is an example that it works the other way too: female as the Dom and male as the Sub. So don't talk about how this movie glorifies acts of violence towards woman.) But then something bad happened, as we can see by the scars on his body. And now he is left to submit strange women not just one that would be his own. And then he finds this young female student. And he sees himself in her. So at this point he wants to make her his own BUT he would treat her right and wouldn't let anything bad happen to her (like those scars on his body-he wanted to make it right for someone). As he, she also is new to the BDSM scene. But of course her soul is not into the scene and that is the reason she leaves. Because in the end, you can't push one into BDSM ‚Äì this is a thing that grows on you, it is not learned, you simply love it or hate it. And that is also why in the next books she ¬Ñnormalizes"" the rich guy and not the other way around. And as for me personally this movie was pleasurable because the guy was hot and I'm like a sub to the scene. A nice romantic story which of course is a dreamy one and does not relate to reality."

","I must say that having not yet ventured into any sexual activity, let alone BDSM, I went into this movie for the mere curiosity surrounding it. And much like the Twilight movies, I found myself bored and unpleased. Basically this movie is about nothing, and not in the good Seinfeld way. To tell you the truth, the only parts with some actual excitement to them were the more spicy ones. It's nothing too extreme, but still sexy in a small way. While the movie does have some good set decoration and wardrobe, that's about all the redeeming qualities about it. The leads share little chemistry, the dialog is awful and the script is about as pointless as it gets. Let's be honest here, I know this is for the ladies looking to see their fantasies on screen and I don't condone that. Still it's clear that apart from those ""bold scenes"", there isn't much more to this movie and its future sequels.<br/><br/>Rating: 1/10"
"AdamCatalyst","4","3","6","2 May 2015"," Dialogue Writing
","This will be a very short review, focused on one single aspect of the movie... the dialogue writing. The dialogue writing in this movie is among the worst of the thousands of movies I've watched. Off the top of my head, I cannot recall any movie that has dialogue as bad as this. I have never read the book, so I have no idea if this is a product of staying true to the source material, I am only judging it in the context of the movie. Characters speak in terribly obvious and unnatural exposition, with long pauses after sentences, so the audience can presumably absorb the subtext. You could shut the picture off altogether, as virtually everything happening is explained in mundane detail by the characters. The dialogue is written at an English level and pacing that would likely be deemed too slow for a children's movie. The movie wasn't for me, so I'm not a good judge of it overall, but as a human being who reads and watches films, I can say the dialogue writing was insulting to my intelligence. Advice... keep your expectations even lower than they may already be."
"boomankeeper","5","3","6","6 March 2015"," was OK
","OK so being my first movie review that I felt I had to do, I thought the movie could have followed the book a bit more closely. If who ever decides the ratings on these movies wanted to make it nc17 the producers needed more flesh to be shown. The acting could have been done better and Ana was OK, but she just seemed awkward. The lip biting was very forced, at least it looked like it. There were a lot of things that was not explained in the movie that needed to be explained. The supposed emails they were writing back and forth did not look like emails bit rather like IM's. Having read the books, I feel that this movie did not do them justice. The books are not as poorly written as some say, they need to stop over thinking the writing and take the book for what it is not for a classic. I really wanted this movie to be really great but in the end it just left me shaking my head wondering if the producers had even spoken with the author or bothered to read the books. E L James, great books, but dear fight for your movie, it's worth it."

Back to the film, I kept up with everything leading up to the release of the movie and I had read the many reviews before viewing, and now I personally feel the film has been highly slaughtered by many viewers, saying this I strongly agree with everyone has a right to their opinions. The film was everything I hoped it would be, like book Christian I fell in love with film Christian. Acting was amazingly done by Jamie and Dakota. Directing was very well done.

As far as film adaptations from books go, I thought it was done quite well in the limited time of a film.<br/><br/>Fascinating, erotic, sad, quirky.<br/><br/>It has a bit of everything really, but not quite enough of any of it.

Anastasia interviews Mr Grey for her friend who is the editor of a University paper. Anastasia looks like a nice girl. During the interview, Anastasia ask Mr Grey if he is gay. He does not date. He does not want a girlfriend. Mr Grey - Christian, takes a fancy to Anastasia and tells her about his problem - straight dominant look for a submissive. He presents her with a contract sitting out the terms and conditions of their relationship. Anastasia does not sign the agreement but falls in love with Christian and allows him to take advantage of her - including a spanking and a wiping. This dominant / submissive relationship is not something that most of us know much about.<br/><br/>The film leaves out some of the characters in the book, the Mrs Robinson is talk about in the film but makes no appearance. A flash back of Christian being the submissive might have been good. It might have given some insight to how Christian's developed his interest in punishing the woman he loves. <br/><br/>The book has been referred to as ""Mummy porn"". The film is a well made and good enough for the public to want to see more. Apart from the punishment, which is very mild in the film. Nothing to upset Mummies. So they will all still be dreaming of a Mr Grey coming into there life. To get the man of your dreams, they might put up with a spanking! Clearly both Christian and Anastasia are in love with each other. It does not have a happy ending, well the ending most people would expect.<br/><br/>I liked the film and the cast were good. So have an open mind and enjoy it."
"c-hallett-smith","1","6","16","15 February 2015"," 50 Shades of Wasted Time and Limited BDSM Knowledge
","Couple years ago managed to force myself through the first book to see what the fuss was about. I have literally read fanfictons with more substance and far better sex scenes. Went to see the movie with my sister to see if they'd managed to adapt it into something tolerable. They haven't.<br/><br/>The movie is just as awful. Bland. Dull. Absolutely NO chemistry between the two leads, which is sort of important in a supposed 'romance' movie, I was very tempted to leave less than halfway through and get a refund. The plot is very almost non existent, there's no logical explanation for Grey wanting Ana, there's no VALID back story for the reason Christian is ""F*ed up"", extremely limited character building and no substance. <br/><br/>The script is beyond poor, some lines that were supposed to be sexy were downright laughable and there were awkward laughs shared by people in the cinema on more than one occasion. The acting was wooden (I've seen my younger brother act more convincingly) and both leads were far from arousing, even to one another it seemed. <br/><br/>And for those of you who have looked extensively through the reviews on here, I'd like you to know that the men and women who have rated this higher than a 3* and claim to see no abuse, have probably never participated or even looked up the BDSM community. <br/><br/>The consent in this movie (if you can call it that) is questionable at best, and the fact that he doesn't even CONSIDER her input and tentativeness towards some things in his contract shows that. He tries to OWN her. He stalks her and controls everything she does from the moment they meet. That is not a consensual relationship. That is abuse. It sickens me that young women BELIEVE that this sort of behavior is OK. <br/><br/>BDSM is nothing like anything in this movie. In a BDSM consensual relationship EVERYTHING is on the subs terms. Absolutely everything. If the sub says stop, you stop. If the sub is happy, you're happy. If the sub says no, you don't push it. What Ana and Christian exhibit is a controlling, manipulative relationship, please look up BDSM and be safe if you're wanting to try and spice up your love life. DON'T USE THIS MOVIE (OR THE BOOKS) AS A LEAD BY EXAMPLE."
"monicahaaf17","1","6","16","15 February 2015"," 50 shades of ABUSE
","Fifty Shades of Grey is a tale of stalking, domestic violence, abuse, and torture, dressed up like a love story! My honest to god biggest fear of 50 Shades of Grey is not that people will watch it, because people will, but that abusers will use it to brainwash their victims more than they already do. That more women will be left wondering why this isn't making them happy when it's suppose to. And more women will be hurt in worse ways because ""this is what everyone else wants."" If someone you care about likes 50 Shades of Grey, ask them if they would be okay with you being in a relationship like that. Ask them what they would do if you came to them and told them your boyfriend is controlling what you eat, what you wear, what you do, and is making you do sex acts you aren't comfortable with. Ask them what they would say if you told them that a man you just met is stalking you at work. Ask them what you should do if a man tries to get you to sign a consent form for sex or asks you to marry him 5 weeks after meeting him. See what they say."

","I have read all 3 books and couldn't put them down. I became obsessed with their love story. The first movie, was exactly what I pictured the characters to be and I thought Dakota Johnson played Ana perfectly. One thing I wish they added was more from the emails. The emails in the book are what made me love their relationship. They had such witty and flirty banter. While the movie showed some, they did not show all. Nor did they show the email signatures (which Christian and Ana would purposely change in the book to flirt or mess with each other). I felt as though the emails back and forth showed a lighter side to Christian. But all in all, the movie was great and I can't wait for ""Darker"" and ""Freed"" to come out cause that's when their story gets really interesting."
"mare_94","10","7","20","5 March 2015"," Perfect!
","I'm not judging this movie because of some sex scenes, or story like in book. This movie is some incredible story about relationship on totally different way and its really perfect in any way. I usually not watching movies two times, but this movie i think i will watch over and over again. Story also has some parts which shows how people are thinking in special situations and dangerous situations, also how much they are ready to get in circle of love with someone who is covered and closed. So for I'm giving to this movie rating 10 cause it's the first movie which makes me feel fantastic. Congrats for writer of book and producers who makes this story more more interesting ;)"

","After reading many disappointing reviews I wasn't expecting much but was really pleasantly surprised. Went to see it with 5 of my girls and everyone of us really enjoyed it and seemed a bit miffed as to why it had been slated so much. <br/><br/>I did feel Anastasia lost her innocence pretty quickly compared to the book but when you have to cram a whole book into a couple of hours something has to give. Excellent performance from Dakota - Anna was just as I imagined her to be from reading the book. I was sceptical about Jamie Dornan playing Christian Grey but I did warm to him towards the end. Cant wait to see the next two films! Well done!"

","Don't care what people say I really enjoyed it and it's obvious loads of other people did as well. What people are saying about it is a lot of very exaggerated bullshit but everyone's entitled to there opinion. I for one cant wait for the next one. Yes the books were better as in more detailed but that is what happens in book to movie adaptations. Some people are going on and on that it's poorly written well if that's the case it wouldn't of been published and I would like to see you do better. I think it's completely idiotic when people say that some of it constitutes as rape, the only time he really hurts her is at the end and that was still consensual she may not have liked it but she agreed to it therefore it's not rape"

Dakota is absolutely stunning and does Ana justice, perfect just perfect. At first I wasn't sure about Jamie Dornan being cast as Christian, and it wasn't until I actually watched the film and saw how he portrayed Christian that I thought ""they got it sooooooo right with him!"" Fans of the books will love it. Can't wait for ""Darker"" and ""Freed"" E.L James should be so proud of her work, so many people love it!

","I usually don't write reviews, but I feel that I need to write this one. I have been a fan of the books since they came out. I thoroughly enjoyed reading them and couldn't wait for the movie to come out and I was not disappointed. I really enjoyed it and thought it was AMAZING!!! The movie was true to the book as much as possible. Of course, some scenes in the books were left out of the movie, but if they were put in the movie then it would have been a four hour movie. I was a little apprehensive regarding the people playing Christian & Ana, but I have to say that Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson were perfect for the parts. They both brought out the characters beautifully.<br/><br/>For people who are giving bad reviews, you really didn't understand the movie. It's not just about BDSM and it's not about an abusive relationship. It's also not PORN like people are making it out to be. Yes there is a lot of sex, but there are a lot of movies out there about sex. The sex scenes in the movie were done tastefully. It's a story about a complicated and troubled love relationship between a successful young billionaire and a sweet innocent young girl. Christian has a troubled past and is used to things a certain way and he meets Ana, who changes his ways even though he fights it. The books go into more depth of their relationship. What they do in their relationship is consensual. He never rapes her. She wants to try new things, but tells him her limits and he abides by them. <br/><br/>People are saying that it's all about abusing women and degrading them. That is not true. This is not the 1950's. It is 2015 and there are tons of sex clubs all over the world and have been for years. Some people like that sort of thing. Who am I to say that it is right or wrong! There have been movies out there through the years regarding Rape, Molestation, Serial Killers, War, Abuse, etc. How come it's okay to do those types of movies, but it's not okay to do a complicated love story with BDSM? What is so different? I know that people are entitled to their own opinions, but they shouldn't cast judgment or make reviews unless they have read the books or seen the movie in full. People should read the books before they go see the movie, then maybe they will understand the love story better.<br/><br/>Also, people are bashing E.L. James and saying that she was a horrible writer. I totally disagree. I thought her writing was Amazing! If her writing was so bad, then why did she sell over 100 million copies of her books. <br/><br/>I sincerely hope that they do the two movie sequels as soon as possible. I am really looking forward to seeing them!!!!"
"KillerRomance","10","8","24","23 February 2015"," The BEST Movie ever made
","As me and my Boyfriend watched this movie on Valentine's Day, None of Us knew what to expect. We heard all the Good and Negative reviews, but out of curiosity we checked it out, and plus it looks great on the Trailer.<br/><br/>Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) a virginal and Pretty English Literature Student had a twist of meeting her Destiny in the form of Handsome but Troubled Billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), and then as they dig deeper into each other, the more they get into a passionate Sexual Love Affair. Sooner or later, Christian tells Ana a dark Secret that he has different taste in Sex, and under many discussions, exclusions and making compromises for the sake of their Love, they go through so much to make their relationship work. Then the roles switch by Surprise. It was Ana who is in Total control, and Christian who is the vulnerable one, she finally breaks him as soon as he is shown the importance of Intimacy.<br/><br/>It is a modern love story of two different people reaching a compromise, and unlike other love stories of two people without not a single dysfunction or flaws. I had been a long term victim of violent assault in the past and lived in a woman's refuge (and recovered from trauma of being manually choked, punched, kicked, broken bones, plus getting my job back, and found a private apartment at the same time.)<br/><br/>This is not a movie about abuse, nor is this movie about rape, there is no forceful sex, but about two consented Adults. The movie is classy, and very Sexy love story, with humorous moments. The script is like watching a beautiful visual book, Both Dakota and Jamie do have amazing sexual chemistry, that goes with the music score and soundtrack. The Beautful Dakota Johnson is an amazing and bold Actress, and Jamie Dornan IS Christian Grey, There is something about Irish Men not just only down to earth, but they are the most beautiful men I ever laid my eyes on. And because of that, I decided to watch the movie the second time by myself. I've been talking about Jamie a lot lately and my Boyfriend is giving me Clint Eastwood looks, so I will watch Jamie when he isn't looking ;p<br/><br/>However we both enjoyed this movie and we saw it with an open mind. This Movie had everything, great plot, mesmerising script, heartbreaking moments, comedy, intense sexual passion, steamy love scenes, including kinky with rough and tumble sexual foreplay, great acting, great photography, good directing, amazing soundtrack and music score; what is not to like? Except leaving you the need to watch it again, it is that fantastic. Leaves you wanting more, keeps you smiling for days; what a truly unforgettable and enjoyable Film. The Best Movie I ever seen in my life. I look forward to seeing the sequels fifty shades Darker and Fifty shades Freed. I also ordered the DVD, and now got the Book Trilogy. 10/10"
"AndyPandy58","10","8","24","23 February 2015"," Jamie Dornan deserves respect and much better reviews
","For me, Jamie Dornan got the Christian Grey of the first book spot on. He is intense, guarded, a man used to being 'in control', whose world was turned on its head by the young naive Ana Steele. It must have been difficult to try and match the imagination of the millions of fans of the book but for me his performance was electrifying, mesmerising... in the final scenes he managed to show us the twisted,tortured person that scared Ana away in his body language and facial expressions alone... He was somewhat restricted by having to deliver key quotes from the books which sound odd when said out loud.... I think Jamie deserves praise for this role not all the poor reviews. It was very brave to take on such an iconic role and I feel he has not been given the respect he deserves for having done so. If he decides not to play Christian in the next movie this will be a shame but I am sure that he has a great future....don't listen to the bad reviews Jamie.. you are a great actor.."

","This is a stunning film that features some of the best acting, directing and editing I have ever experienced. The lead actor is fantastically well endowed and his lady friend displays a body of a goddess. If you enjoy adult filmography as much as the cinema viewer next to me I promise that this is not a film to missed or to be unprepared for. Firstly you should bring a large box of tissues (male viewers) and a pulsing devise that is subtle yet powerful (female viewers). Secondly this is not a production that should be disturbed by edible treats, if you are viewer that needs popped corn I discourage this greatly as it hinders the full bodied experience that excite the senses. Lastly please try not to excrete any bodily fluids over the person seated next too you or become handcuff to ones own seat. <br/><br/>In conclusion this film, despite leading to my humiliation at my local movie theatre is excellent."

","This movie is just an insult on the whole human race... especially to our women. I apologize to women around the world, rest assured that there are plenty of men out there that don't treat women like this in REAL life and actually respect them as the important mothers, sisters and daughters that they are in our societies. Only reason why I rated it 2 and not 1 is it made me realize how not to ever treat a women so there is something good that came out of it I guess. But overall very saddening experience... especially on valentines day??? Buzz kill. #whereisthelove<br/><br/>I think we need to start being way more strict on Hollywood because most movies making it to the big screen are really poor efforts at being artistic. Most of them don't even convey important messages anymore! This movie in particular! Who funds this garbage anyway! Seriously cannot remember the last time I watched a movie and it left me thinking about it for longer than 10 seconds afterwards..."
"Allisonjane46","1","5","13","15 February 2015"," No chemistry!
","Pro (there is one): pretty cinematography Cons: lifeless, bland, no chemistry between the main characters, corny lines, horrible writing, boring, weird casting choices, very few and tame sex scenes, insincere and forced ""passion"" and bad acting<br/><br/>My fianc√© and I wasted our Valentine's Day night watching this. There were times in the movie where the dialogue or the line was so corny that the entire movie theater laughed. I had relatively high expectations for the movie. I read the 3 books a few years ago. While they certainly reeked of Bella and Edward, and poorly written erotica, this movie is worse. It was so boring. A very poor adaption of an already poorly thought out story. <br/><br/>Jamie Dornan was not good a fit for Christian Grey. I have see him in a few other things and enjoy his work. I'm not sure if it was the writing or him, but everything he said came out awkward and overly rehearsed. The American accent did not work great for him either. Dakota Johnson I did not really like either for this role. I have never seen her in many thing else but while she fits the character of Ana more than Jamie fits Christian, I feel like her acting was not great. Everyone else in this filmed absolutely sucked at acting as well (or maybe it was the poor screenplay - I don't know). I noticed they took a lot of stuff verbatim from the book - it was a lot better left on paper. A lot of the lines, like I said, just sounded unnatural and weird. <br/><br/>One thing this movie lacked a lot of was the natural grace and realistic dialogue that good acting has. The actors and the screenplay sounded very unrealistic and nothing anyone would ever actually say in real life. It was just not relatable - it totally missed that very important aspect of believability and naturalness. Everything sounded over produced and scripted. <br/><br/>This movie also has one of the most severe cases of lack of chemistry that I have ever seen between two main love interest characters. I didn't feel like it was believable at all that they liked each other. It felt like a lot of weird fake forced passion from Christian's end and again just really unnatural. <br/><br/>Not to mention, the movie was super boring, even more so than the book. The plot seemed very predictable and I am not exactly sure where the climax of the movie was supposed to be. I guess the end - but it was a pretty dry climax. <br/><br/>Neither my boyfriend or I enjoyed this movie and I feel like I wasted my money. Way over hyped. There are no real redeemable qualities about the actors, writing, sex or anything else that a good movie has. I do applaud the great marketing campaign this movie committed to for most of 2014. Unfortunately it was a lot of hype for a major let down. I really wanted to like it but it is probably one of the worst movies I have seen in a while."

Is THE DIRECTOR and PRODUCERS FAULT!!! and now that face of this disaster are Dakota and James.....let's be fair.<br/><br/>The movie is a ""sunday afternoon movie"", for young girls that don't know nothing about sex, life and any experience. BUT, let's be clear. THAT IS WHAT THE BOOK IS!! No more than that. A fairy tale of the Prince Charming with money and a little bit hot?<br/><br/>I read the books, expecting for something else, looks like wrote it a teenager with 15 years old. And of course, I pay for them, and contribute with the success and crazy sales. Even when doesn't like me. The same with movie. <br/><br/>Is a shame that Hollywood spend a lot a money in a movie like that, That could be a better movie, better than the book. And we are NOT talking about a Hard Porn. <br/><br/>Can you imagine with Christian Bale (remember him in American Psycho) and let's say...figure it out.

"alysgeorge","1","5","13","15 February 2015"," Terrible film!
","When the books first came out, I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. The way in which these books are written is simply terrible. Poor effort. Although an okay storyline.<br/><br/>I agreed to go and watch Fifty Shades of Grey yesterday, feeling a little dubious I must admit. I felt that they spent a lot of the time playing music which didn't really even fit the scenes. Then moments which were meant to feel sexy and seductive, had the opposite effect and made everyone cringe in the cinema. Some were actually laughing at how ridiculous the whole thing was.<br/><br/>I really didn't think it could be any worse than the books, but yet it was. I suggest watching the film, so that you can see for yourself how horribly made it was. This film could have been so much more if they tried harder. Worst film I have seen in a very long time. <br/><br/>My friend and I actually felt uncomfortable the whole way home after watching this.<br/><br/>Also, Christian Grey was a terrible actor in this, Anastasia at least tried on her part"

","I seriously don't think that any of the actors or actresses have got enough recognition for this movie. Regardless of some other views, I think Jamie Dornan fitted the role of Christian Grey perfect. He is an amazing actor and this showed how versatile he is. I'm from Jamie's hometown and everyone loves him here and couldn't be as proud that we have yet again another top class actor. I found it gripping through out with plenty of ups and downs just like the book. I also loved the fact that so many big artists, such as Beyonce and Sia produced music for the soundtrack. This movie lived up to my expectations. Looking forward to hopefully Darker!!!"
"jazzie_77","6","9","29","12 February 2015"," As good (or bad) as the book ;-)
","The book wasn't that good, but it was nice material to read on the beach. But it is more a romantic love story with a lot of playful scenes, where slowly he opens up and you will learn more about his past.. the other books has less sex scenes than the first book.. and focuses mainly on their difficult relationship, his past, and some dark figures which makes it more a thriller than a kinky story. And the 2nd en 3rd are even worse than the first book haha, but in the end I wanted to know how it ended, so I think the writer did well after all ;-)<br/><br/>But... the book was never supposed to be a pornographic book or movie.. it just tickles your imagination... And it was meant for a broad public... So how can you expect the movie to more exciting or kinky than the book as a few reviews mentioned on the internet... <br/><br/>I think the movie was as good (or bad) as the book.. Dakota Johnson plays Anastacia well.. there is some joyful playfulness in her role, where in the end she's more in control... I liked watching her. And Mr. Grey.. well... Jamie Dornan, wasn't so convincing in his role as very young CEO... But as a strong lover he does fine I guess for a lot of women ;-)<br/><br/>The movie actually follows the book quite perfectly.. So I'll give it a 6 out of 10... It wasn't disappointing as I didn't expect so much, it wasn't overwhelming either."

","When I was waiting for see it I was nervous, because I thought that the sex scenes were going to be way more explicit, but it wasn't. I love the story and how Anastasia force herself to please Christian, even though she wanted him to be more romantic. Also I really like how Christian yield to Anastasia, despite of the terms he imposed. The movie made me feel a roller-coaster of emotions because it went from a sexual scene to a romantic and dramatic, one of them heartbreaking. I think that you have to be very mature to see it and understand the world of BDSM, it is not awful at all, it is great, definitely advisable and very clever due to the decision to moderate the strong scenes making it suitable for more ages, at least in Argentina it was rated SAM 16 C/R (only suitable for ages +16 with warning)"

","I LOVED IT.... The actors played their roles brilliantly & are exactly how I imagined them to be, especially Jamie Dornan he is the PERFECT Christian Grey & very very HOT. His acting within the role was superb his attention to detail came across amazingly, I also think Dakota was very true to Ana & did a fantastic job. The pair of them had brilliant on screen chemistry together.<br/><br/>I think it is a great adaptation of the book, obviously not all the sex parts of the book are shown in the film (if they where there would be one about every 3 minutes..) I feel the film compliments the book perfectly & I liked that not everything was in the film as I could fill the gaps in myself & knew exactly what Ana was thinking. People who have said it's an insult to the BDSM community well all I can say is people have to remember that this one persons perception of that life style.. E.L James wrote her book based upon her perception of two people with two very different lifestyles joining together. It's not a factual book & certainly does not claim to be one. It's a fantastic love story & written well by E.L James, with amazing attention to detail, fantastic scene setting & is very descriptive. The director of the film did a brilliant job making it very tasteful, beautiful & enticing just like E.L James did with the books. <br/><br/>I'd also like to comment of those reviews that say Ana is raped, there is no rape in the book, half of the book is about contracts / agreements & consent. She is not abused & people can throw these terms around far to quickly & loosely. Ana agrees to what she's comfortable with & willing to try, she also has ""safe words"" to use so at any point she can stop any situation she's not 100% comfortable with, Also just because Ana cries do not mean she's emotionally abused either.<br/><br/>Not everyone will enjoy the book/film but that's the case with ANY book/film. Someone will always find something they don't like or disagree with etc. <br/><br/>I personally can't wait to see the sequels, My only niggle is I wish it was longer & hope the next two are at the very least 2.5 hours long :) All the negative reviews that are simply not constructive just sound like narrow minded people to me, but every one is entitled to their own opinion and this was mine :)"

They meet each other by chance and fall in love. For now you might think that you've seen it hundreds of times and you are definitely right about it. Most things in this movie is so well known and familiar that it bores you. Accordingly, if you continue watching it as another complicated love story, you might walk out of theater or order a cup of coffee to keep yourself awake. What I tried is to look at this story in a different perspective, something alike to Nymphomaniac or even more, Blue Is the Warmest Color (the comparison does not necessarily mean they are equally good). At the end of the day, not many films, at least in Hollywood, talk about BDSM or dominant/submissive sex experience.<br/><br/>Having said that, I was very surprised that the film is R rated. And it's not only a rating, it perfectly describes what approach director Sam Taylor-Johnson took while filming it. To shortly say, it could have been much more erotic and as they say, book has lots of it. <br/><br/>I will try to talk about the love-story side of Fifty Shades of Grey. We all know it's shitty cause it's very average and not original. By saying that I mean everything, including relationship lineup, dialogues, character development and extremely predictable ""twists"". Instead, I will focus on Grey's fetish - BDSM. <br/><br/>Dornan's character is an absolute clich√© of rich playboy - handsome, full of gadgets, self confidence and kindness. But his sexual life is nothing alike of others. The only way he gets sexual satisfaction is pain, pain of other partner who is always submissive. In any world, one can not easily find an absolute submissive person, who is ready to enjoy the physical stab because other person does. So, Christian has to negotiate with Anastasia step by step, tries to talk her into his dangerous game. Miss Steele is ready to try for sake of love. I don't want to spoil anything, if its possible, so I'll just generally tell the idea. <br/><br/>The film provokes many thoughts on BDSM: whether it's normal; whether it's naturally born attraction or later formed due to specific life events. Fifty Shades of Grey gives a definite answer, which you might not agree, just like me. But it does give an answer. Another deal-breaker is how another person can accept this sexual behavior and if the denial is really about the pain or humiliation. <br/><br/>For Grey, bandaging, spanking, slapping is a form of endearment, a form of loving and the only way to experience orgasm. He means nothing degrading by that. To the contrary, Anastasia perceives it in a different way - the way most of us probably would do. While she sometimes enjoys it, since Christian seems to be very professional/good at it, there is a part of her that feels wrong, as if being submissive has nothing to do with love.<br/><br/>As I mentioned above, this film has some similarities with Nymphomaniac, which also talks about masochist sex. But the latter is more sincere and open about it, showing sexual desires more naked and a it is. For me, Trier's film was sometimes too hard to watch, too explicit and very true. While Fifty Shades of Grey demonstrates BDSM in more acceptable way, which I enjoyed to watch. I mean, it maybe something most of us have never experienced, but I have to acknowledge that each sex scene was beautifully shot, perfectly shooting the pleasure of both parties. The biggest complain I have is that it could have been more +18. In it's core, dominant/submissive sex has nothing to do with shame or diffidence and filming this scenes with shyness does not feel frank enough.<br/><br/>As for Blue Is the Warmest Color it had more explicit sex scenes that, everyone agrees, was one of the most pleasant scenes in years. So what director Sam Taylor-Johnson could have done is to adopt the same attitude by filming her movie in more ""pornish"" way that would be equally acceptable. <br/><br/>Even though Dakota Johnson is an exact pretty face a girl like Anastasia should be, her performance was far below average. Her tears, drama scenes were somehow irritating. But Jamie Dornan was quite much better, especially in the last sex scene, where he finally gets what he wants and you can see it in every move, emotion and wrinkle on his face.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman, who has created some magnificent music for Good Will Hunting, Milk and Big Fish, did nothing special for Fifty Shades of Grey. In fact, at the end of the movie, I remembered none of track played during the film. Only Beyonce's memorable song captured the spirit of film perfectly.<br/><br/>Oscar nominee cinematographer Seamus McGarvey did not have much to do here, but he did picture several sex scenes in a very good way, focusing on important parts (!) sometimes, moving through bodies of lead characters and giving glimpse on their faces. It created an impressive motion that kept audience engaged in sexual act, at least, sometimes.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you are looking for groundbreaking, philosophically deep discussions on sexual behavior, Fifty Shades of Grey will disappoint you. If you are going to watch it as a love story, it will disappoint you. But if you try to look at it as a discussion of BDSM and not generally accepted sexual life, it will definitely provoke some controversial thoughts"
"degoeijt","3","4","10","19 March 2015"," Frustrating, pointless, a missed opportunity
","I personally didn't read the book before watching this movie (and now I probably never will anyway), so I can't make a comparison between both.<br/><br/>I didn't like the movie one bit and felt like there was absolutely zero chemistry between the two lead characters. It makes you wonder why they're attracted to each other and the characteristics of both figures seem completely off.<br/><br/>Jamie Dorman attempts to portray the character of Christian Grey who is supposed to be this dominant, wealthy businessman that wants his counterpart to submissively surrender to fulfil all his sexual needs. Why he chooses Anastasia is beyond me, as he can certainly find a lot of way more attractive women to fulfil those needs than her, who are as 'innocent' as she is or are willing to play that role. I get it, Anastasia isn't used to anything sexually and that arouses Grey's dominant nature, but when she constantly argues with what she wants to do and can voice her opinion and wills time and time again, it just doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Dakota Johnson portrays Anastasia Steele as this innocent girl with no sexual experience to speak of, yet suddenly goes all out with someone she barely knows and interferes in all kinds of SM role playing that she doesn't know anything about. I mean she even asks Grey, when he talks about his 'play room' with a seductive face (well again, attempting it), if that's the room where he plays on his consoles like the XBOX, Playstation and whatnot. Has she been living in a cave all her life? Then she enters the room and asks all these dumb questions about what everything is used for, yet a couple of scenes later she's making up a contract and acts like a very confident young lady, who knows exactly what she wants to try and leave out.<br/><br/>The characters; the relationship; the lack of plot; the awful acting; it all just doesn't make any sense and it makes for a really terrible movie.<br/><br/>This movie will still do great in the box office though, because of the enormous hype surrounding it, which is the reason why you can't even blame directors for junk like this. If there's a demand for crap, they'll squash one out and collect the money.<br/><br/>Disappointing, as the concept could make for a psychologically thrilling movie. Sex is a very complicated and weird phenomenon and the struggle between what's normal and what's not, and what crosses the line and what doesn't, could make for a really interesting screenplay. Especially when both characters would actually unmistakably fall in love with each other and if there was actually a lot of chemistry noticeable between the both of them. None of which is seen in this movie.<br/><br/>Truly a missed opportunity."
"kmdk72","9","4","10","21 February 2015"," Great film for fans of the book!
","Great movie, better than the book. I like the fact that it wasn't as ""sex"" heavy as the books. I believe that the sex scenes in the book got way too repetitive and took away from the story. The movie on the other hand, told the story without getting bogged down by sex. It did leave out some important things that Christian said in the books that bring the readers to a level of understanding as to his character. The book was great at showing Christians need for sex with Ana ( which I believed in his mind was his way of showing he cared for her and needed her). That didn't come across very well in the movie. The chemistry between the two leads was great and believable. Both Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan did a fantastic job. They sold the love story between Ana and Christian and I can't think of any other actors I would have like to have seen in the role. I am looking forward to seeing it again and can't wait for the sequel."

","Movie represented book very good. Of course not every detail could be included but I think that both Jamie and Dakota portrayed the characters correctly and caught the spirit of the story. The chemistry between Jamie and Dakota was great. Sam Taylor Johnson gave class to the movie. I hope that they bring her back. Don't listen to the critics make your decisions but go see twice so that you can get it all in. I found that the first time I saw it I was reviewing what was left out from the book. Instead the second time I went and watched the movie for itself. I loved it the second time around. I may go see it again. Can't wait for the DVD and for Darker!"

"gracelin777","9","4","10","19 February 2015"," I don't understand why the rating is so poor...
","I personally think this is a great movie.<br/><br/>Though Jamie Dornan could have probably done better on portraying Grey as a more intense and cold person, I do think the current version is decent.<br/><br/>Love how director match the scenes with different piece of musics, from gentle and mellow songs that go with romantic getaway to fast-paced intense musics that go with hot sex scenes. After all, we witness how the album is being rated on iTunes Store. The score is currently 5/5.<br/><br/>This movie is unlike other traditional love stories. You might find it impossible for a rich billionaire to fall for a college student, but you can't deny the story line is very distinctive and attractive.<br/><br/>There are people who read the book and complaint about how the movie doesn't follow the book well... all I care is whether I enjoyed the movie while watching it. It doesn't matter whether it matches with the book. Harry Potter movies derail from the books, but people still like it."

","I don't know why people are hating on this movie. You knew what it was about. If you didn't like the books of course you wouldn't like the movie. I thought it was great. I loved the books. I wasn't expecting much from the movie. I thought it would be like Twilight. Done horribly. But it wasn't. It went by the books perfectly. The actors were great. Dakota Johnson did a fantastic job portraying Ana. Jaime Dorson's accent could've been better. And I feel like they could've been more into it. But they still did good. And about this rape/abuse nonsense? I don't get where you guys are coming from. Not once does he have sex with her without her permission. And she could've left at anytime. (Which she does). So if she had felt abuse.. She would've stopped him. She's 22. A consenting adult. And that last scene, she asked him to do his worse to see what it was like. He did.. She hated it.. And she left. They were awkward at the beginning for a reason. That's how they were supposed to act. They had great chemistry, though I feel like they could've been more into it. I'm done ranting.. I just wanted to share my opinion. You all knew the plot before you saw it. And went in ready to hate it. Others enjoyed it. Move on."
"Dpointkowski","8","4","10","15 February 2015"," See The Movie For Yourself And Then Decide....
","I have read all three books and I thought the movie was not going to be as good as the book. But, I was completely wrong! I also thought Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson did not fit the part for Christian and Anna when I first heard they had been casted. But, boy was I also wrong. However, due to the nature of this book I did expect a lot of sex scenes, which encompassed about 20 minutes of the movie. But, I thought the sex scenes were tastefully done and left your imagination up to deciphering what was not seen on film. <br/><br/>I think many of us get distracted or cannot get past the (graphic) sex scenes in the movie, to actually understand the deeper meaning of this story. There is a REASON--a vital reason, why Christian is the way he is. The fact that he opened up to Anna about his personal life while she was sleeping portrays his vulnerability and I felt like he was being pulled between two worlds--the one he wants with Anna and the one he currently pursues with his singular tastes. <br/><br/>I feel like Dakota played Anna in a similar, but very different way than the Anna portrayed in the book. She was curious, awkward, naive like the book, yet towards the end she became more strong willed and confident in what she really wanted. I really enjoyed her performance. As women, I feel like we love to get inside a person's mind and try to change them. I think that is why Anna is so fixated on Christian, because he is tormented and scarred. He has secrets that Anna wants to heal. He is so complicated and confusing that it intrigues Anna to really get to know the person he is under the surface. For men, I know they see with their eyes and are not as emotional or desperate to uncover a person's real story. There is so much tension that can be felt between the two characters and once the movie ends it will certainly leave you wanting to see how the 2nd installment turns out. <br/><br/>This movie was very well done for a book based on BDSM and I think if you at least have read the books or if you can go into the film with an open mind you will thoroughly enjoy it, it might be a little awkward to see with a bunch of strangers, but the movie is well worth seeing and I cannot wait to see the next one."
"mirooka","7","4","10","15 February 2015"," A great movie for fans of the books.
","Okay, first, I'd like to get this out of the way - this movie was made for women. WOMEN. W-O-M-E-N. Women are it's main target audience. Every guy you'll see watching this was probably dragged there by his wife/girlfriend/partner or he lost a bet. So any reviews made by men that mock the movie and laugh at the women who actually like it - don't get your anger about not being able to make it stand up on the keyboard. This movie was not meant for you, and you reviews are being backed up by other equally sexually frustrated men.<br/><br/>Now on to the movie itself. The plot is pretty much sticking to the books, with a few changes, here and there. The script is no different. Dornan (Christian Grey) says exactly the same things his character says in the books, while Johnson (Ana Steele) has a more feisty dialog than her literary equivalent. (Ana shouting ""Red"" at Chrstian at the last scene was a nice touch, and I was really impressed about how much Dornan was in-character and stopped on the spot.)<br/><br/>Though not a romantic-dramatic masterpiece, the movie has its emotional moments where you can really empathize with Ana (and sometimes even Christian). The sex scenes - and the characters sexuality - play a big role in setting the tone to each scene, and Dornan and Dakota spend an impressive amount of time inside each other's mouth. Personally, it was hard for me to watch the sex scenes without thinking about the fact that Dornan's wife, Amelia Warner, was heavily pregnant with their daughter during the shooting. (The sex scenes were shot last.)<br/><br/>The acting was excellent. People that complain about the 'dry' script, or how ""awkward"" Dornan and Johnson look, obviously never read the books. It's one-to-one, exactly how the fans wanted it. I'd really like to praise Dakota's acting - she was witty, and funny, and she changed the emotion in her voice according to the scene. It was a very pleasant surprise, because in the trailers she sounded really monotonous, which made me worry. Jamie's dialogs were exactly what you would expect - short and without much explanation behind them. He was very introvert, and portrayed Christian beautifully.<br/><br/>Regarding the sex scenes - though not as racy as I expected them to be, it has been a long time since the big screens of Hollywood saw so much breast and ass and moaning and groaning. Dornan was controlling (excuse the pun) all the way, like he knew what he was doing, and he expressed both pain and pleasure, at the same time.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is a great treat to fans. E.L. James promised to stick to the book - and she was true to her word. Taylor-Johnson (the director) did an amazing job in bringing this best seller to life, focusing more on the romantic aspect of the story, while the sex, which got rougher as the plot went on, was used to indicate the inevitable climax (again, excuse the pun).<br/><br/>I recommend watching it with close friends or boyfriend/girlfriend, but only if you're really close, because most chances are you're going to behave in a way only the people closest to you are allowed to see."
"sarahdill04-19-286256","8","4","10","14 February 2015"," True to the book
","Honestly people, if you have not read the books don't judge the film so harshly. The movie stuck very closely to the book while leaving out one of my favorite scenes. The acting was a lot better than I had expected. Jamie Dorian's American accent could use a little more work but Dakota Johnson was great. She looked beautiful in the film and her acting was on point for Ana. All I can say is do not go in with too high of expectations. The story did seem a little rushed at times but you can't get every single detail into a movie. I think I would have liked Dakota doing commentary throughout the film so we could hear some of her thoughts. Overall, I loved the movie and thought they did an excellent job. Looking forward to Darker and Freed!"

I don't get why it got such bad ratings most people didn't read the book so it's understandable. Then people who read the book say its not like the book. people fail to realize its a movie and the book is way to graphic. Don't TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS.<br/><br/>I personally enjoyed it i know its a story and its fake if you go to watch this movie under the impression its real and that your going to see some crazy sex no. Its more of the chemistry between the characters and Ana the main actor being empowering and not completely submitting to Mr. Grey. so its full of twist and turns. there are no explanations. so read the book because you will just get thrown in a movie that will make u feel awkward."

There was no surprises or the thoughts, where is that part of the book. They defined it very well. It gives us the incite of what to really expect from S&M and BDSM , great movie for couples. This book made into a movie is good for men, because we all know men don't really like to read they are more visual creatures. I am sure that after more couples watch this movie there will be more communication and incites to make their sexual relationships steamy and loving. I so can't wait to buy the movie. I rated this movie 10 out of 10 very impressed. I so can't wait for the others to come out. Thank you for letting this book be captured into a motion picture."

I saw all the negative reviews and though oh boy, not expecting anything.<br/><br/>Now for the surprise, the movie is pretty cheesy, some of the conversations and replies boy oh boy however it is pretty darn entertaining. It is sexy and provocative and I seriously suggest that you watch it with your partner/date in the comfort of your home as this movie is will end in 99% guaranteed sex on your side whoever you are male or female. It has great music and the movie is actually Romantic... let me rephrase it, after I watched the movie and knowing that it would pretty much finish on a cliffhanger as it is part of a trilogy I went on wiki and read the plot for all 3 books. Things started to make sense and I can see very clearly the romantic side.<br/><br/>The movie is a romantic story, call it a modern beauty and the beast but with a lot of kinkiness and BDSM, will he love her? will he change his ways for her? will he be able to show compassion and romanticism? will he accept her and her ways and be solid relationship? who knows... bring on the other 2 movies:))"

This movie is getting a lot of criticism when there are plenty of movies that are far worse. First of all, the movie was adapted from the book which was exceptionally toned down in all aspects, less possessive, less obsessive, etc. Johnson did an amazing job making this movie into a story and not just an Erotic film. They storyline itself was incredible, the sound track fit perfectly and i personally loved the soundtrack. Sure there are a few cheesy lines, but i found that some of the lines that were cheesy were directly from the book. All many sexual scenes were cut from the book, the lines remained. I read all the books and i personally love the movie more. The actors have an amazing chemistry and the actress who played Ana Steele played her exceptionally well. She made her strong and independent, do i need to even explain how good Jamie Dorian is? They were made for these roles. Yes (spoiler) at the end of the movie there is a scene of abuse, but the film addressed this very well. Ana doesn't just run away and doesn't just accept it she addresses it. throughout the whole movie Ana asks many questions about these ""messed""(abusive? not really) up things Christian wants to do..<br/><br/>And there are many movies that are far worse...think about any lifetime movie, there are movies about boyfriend girlfriend physical abuse, rape movies, murder movies...so lets relax okay..

","I honestly believe this movie is not for those who haven't read the books. When I started reading the books, I was kind of shocked that they would try to make a movie out of it. It's one of those stories that's good to read, but hard to make into a movie. Movies these days do best when there are a lot of explosions or action going on, and this is not one of those stories. Also, reading the books gives you further insight into the characters and why they are the way they are. I feel that they both portrayed the book character's personalities well, but without knowing what's going on within, the movie just makes them seem weird. I couldn't imagine liking this movie too much if I hadn't read the books, so I can see why it's getting all the bad reviews. I do encourage people to read the books. I actually liked the second two better than the first, because you get more of the story and more closure. I really don't think this story is about BDSM. It has a sweet ending, and they both go through quite a bit of character development, especially Christian.<br/><br/>The actors selected to play Ana and Christian are both excellent choices.

Now to me that makes no sense because that is what's in the book and people know this. So why are people slamming the movie saying how appalling it is to objectify women like this blah blah blah. That is what is in the book! At least the first one anyway. Plus we all need to remember that this is just a film and not a personal insult on you people who are so offended by it. <br/><br/>I do think that there were some important parts of the book that were cut from the movie but we need to understand that they can't have every single detail in the film otherwise we'd be sat there for half a day. Also people you need to realize that yes the sex scenes needed to be tamed down otherwise it would be classed as a porno. Just bare in mind that as far as i know, this was Dakota's and Jamie's first time doing a film with sex in it so at times they may have appeared abit wooden or awkward. I think Jamie did a great job portraying Christian and Dakota was perfect for Ana. The film itself was pretty good, not brilliant but still good. I think the second and third one will be better and i look forward to watching them."

"tijanadmitrovieuropemail","10","3","7","20 March 2017"," Why Am I Giving It A Ten
","I watched Fifty Shades Grey yesterday March 19 2017 from my European Union Croatian HBO Telekom Provider at my Asus S 200 E Notebook with Windows 8 Pro 64 Bit installment. God knows I tried not comparing 50 Shades Grey which is a second part of the novel thrillogy and a first part of a cinematic thrillogy to an original 9 1/2 Weeks but it is just impossible not to. I read every novel from a thrillogy and the first I read was a novel Fifty Shades Freed 23rd September 2013 as a to be continued first (...) part of a novel thrillogy which would be a third part of a cinematic thrillogy scheduled for a premiere February 2018. I am not going to be reviewing pros and cons but an overall cinematic impression. From my respectful perspective, I would not utilise any part of this cinematic artistry for a sales and marketing campaign. That written, Grey's cinematic fashion is awful. It is as if director utilised a fashion designer retro creativity to remind viewers of a fashion from a 9 1/2 Weeks cinematic artistry which would be ridiculed with a denim street fashion. Secondly, Christian Grey is not handsome enough for a suit nor for a denim. I would rather visualise Grey in a some kind of an uniform. In such a manner, it would become rather interesting for a director to destrict his uniform appearance to submissive because, in a matter of a Fifty Shades Thrillogy, Christian Grey is a submissive even though cinematic story evolves around submissive philosophical tutorials given to Anastasia Steel. In my not so humble opinion, this would be a difference between 9 1/2 Weeks and a Fifty Shades Thrillogy which an author El James, due her a wee-bit infantile approach, did not successfully disclosed to a reader nor to a viewer. Nevertheless, I am giving it a ten for this childish approach even though I would never invest my rationalised financials into this cinematographic piece."
"Portrait-of-a-Statue","10","3","7","19 October 2016"," Compelling Love Story Dragged Down by Hype and Bad Source Material
","Christian Grey said ""I don't do romance."" Neither do I. I've never read a ""romance novel"" in my entire life, let alone one that was universally panned as being badly written. I didn't know who Jamie Dornan was, had never seen Dakota Johnson in a movie or TV show, and hadn't paid much attention to magazine articles or reviews of Fifty Shades of Grey. I first watched the movie long after everyone else had moved on. <br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey, considered on its own merits, is a compelling movie.<br/><br/>Let's start with ""rich."" Christian Grey is very, very, very rich. The director, art designer, and set designer created a beautiful and believable billionaire's world. It was also tasteful and elegant. The world-class artwork is evocative of the Pacific Northwest, the location of the movie. Kudos on the sumptuous environment and for the discreet way it was handled in the film. We inhabited the world and were able to appreciate it without having it shoved down our throats. No one ever talks about how much the helicopter cost, for instance.<br/><br/>The costume designer dressed Christian in understated and very expensive clothing. Classic suits are a good choice for a young billionaire. Dressing well in ""grown-up"" clothes lends him gravitas. And, well, when you are working with Jamie Dornan's face and body, you don't need to go fancy. Showcase the face and body. Both are off-the-charts gorgeous. <br/><br/>Anastasia Steele's world and wardrobe were also handled well. Totally believable. <br/><br/>Let's talk about the lovers. Anastasia and Christian had a prolonged ""meet-cute"" that worked. The office scene in which Anastasia interviews Christian was an expertly handled introduction for viewers. She's a virginal, very intelligent but unsophisticated student. She's not meek though. She challenges him. He's hyper-controlling, even of himself, and highly successful. There's sadness there. Anastasia reaches something within him. <br/><br/>Dornan took a lot of heat for his portrayal of Grey but I think he was brilliant. Dornan's body movements were tight and his voice was modulated because he was, wait for it, ""controlled."" Christian is a damaged man and he moves and speaks in a way designed to protect himself. Dornan's eyes gave away what he was feeling. Those eyes became more and more expressive as his feelings for Anastasia grew. <br/><br/>Dakota Johnson's Anastasia was sublime. She was utterly naturalistic in her acting and utterly believable. If Dornan's eyes were the key to understanding Christian, Johnson's mouth was the key to understanding Anastasia. Johnson can do more with a nanosecond flex of the muscles on the side of her mouth than most actresses can do with 10 lines of dialogue.<br/><br/>The dialogue was the biggest problem with this movie but I've come to understand a lot of the dialogue was verbatim from the book. Too bad. The dialogue was sometimes but, thankfully, not too often, laughable. ""I'm fifty shades of f....ed up."" We have to give the actors credit for selling some lines that were real clunkers. <br/><br/>Finally, let's talk about the sex scenes. I thought they were sexy, each scene in its own way. Christian could be remarkably tender with Ana. When he wasn't being tender, nothing he did shocked me. But I didn't need to be shocked. It's a love story. I cared about the characters and enjoyed seeing them enjoy each other. Dornan and Johnson had chemistry and beautiful bodies. Okay. I'm in.<br/><br/>The scene in which Christian beats Anna with a belt was the catalyst for their break-up. I don't like to watch men beating women but it's important to remember that she asked him to do it and that is was ritualistic. ""Count, Anastasia."" That's what redeems the character of Christian here. If he'd beaten her in anger, it would be a very different story. And he was clearly upset afterwards. And devastated when she leaves him. <br/><br/>Here's my advice. If you haven't already seen Fifty Shades of Grey, try watch it without expectation. Watch it without reading too many reviews (except this one, of course.) If you're thinking about watching it again, watch it knowing that the director and actors paid great attention to detail. Fifty Shades of Grey is an understated movie surrounded by hyperbole and pseudo-controversy. Tune out the noise. Let the movie speak for itself."
"cyberboy_uk","7","3","7","19 June 2015"," What, you thought I wouldn't recognise you??!
","In a way, I didn't really recognise it since I read all three books, in the Fifty Shades trilogy, in one weekend. Now, the movie had obviously been something I was dying to see. But it did take me quite a long time to take the opportunity to watch ""the year's most talked about movie!""<br/><br/>Originally I had even bought tickets to see the premier but the wife ended up being ill that day and so we got a refund. We never bothered to re-purchase them though, partly because of the reviews we'd read, and so it's only now, having ordered the DVD, that I got to watch it. Also with it being the disc containing the unseen ending I decided to watch that instead. This means I haven't actually seen the theatre version. Having heard a few views online, and thinking it was probably somehow censored for the intended audience, I decided it was more likely to be how the ending should have been. <br/><br/>The start, though, was a horrible disappointment. One of the things I loved about reading the book was getting into the mind of Ana, her chatty style and how I had connected with the character. To find this was not there was hard to take. As I remembered it, I was hooked on her way before Mr. Grey was introduced so to skip through in some kind of simultaneous introduction felt like being cheated. Especially when the fall through Christian's office door was awfully fake and just highlighted how the depth of the book's beginning had been skipped. <br/><br/>However, there is a big but here. OK, so the start seemed bad, BUT I was already invested in the story and the characters having read the book. I quickly found myself reacting to events, enjoying and living what was going on. And that's without even getting to a single sex scene. Perhaps there was always going to be difficult choices to make as to what to cut from the book, and what not to, and so at times it did feel like something was missing. Like how it suddenly skipped to Ana receiving copies of a book from Christian as a gift, like an RKO, out of nowhere. <br/><br/>As for the actors, Christian was suitably intense if not slightly less bold than I had previously pictured. Ana, unfortunately, was styled with a fringe which is pretty much my number one pet hate what it comes to a woman's appearance. I don't think I've seen anyone look good with a fringe, or bangs as some people may call it. Especially not on Mia, by the way, who was nothing like I imagined. On the other hand Christian's brother was probably just right. Ana's role was overall played pretty well as I rarely found myself thinking about how she was acting and lived along with her emotions instead. She still wasn't what I had pictured though. There is an early drawing/art idea somewhere for Ana online that is exactly what I'd pictured so it's a shame that wasn't followed up on, for me anyway. <br/><br/>Before I started to write this review I was undecided should I give it 7 or 8 out of 10. I think from the above it sadly has to be the 7. It's close though, as while the movie progressed I realised the beauty in not having Ana's thoughts transferred, from the book, to the screen. That was, that I found myself hearing those thoughts in my head whilst watching. It was a bit like the director had assumed the majority of people watching this would have read the book already and have preconceptions of how it was going to be. So a bit like in the book, you had to picture for yourself what it was like. In the movie you had to imagine what Ana was thinking for yourself. <br/><br/>As a movie overall it was a typically decent Hollywood production that flew by as you easily experienced the show without really seeing a masterpiece. This probably justifies the rating and highlights why many seem to have been disappointed with it. Obviously a lot of the explicit description found in the book was left out of the movie as quite simply they wouldn't have been allowed to broadcast it in mainstream cinemas otherwise. I can't help feeling, that in the right hands, an adult film production, of this story, could have been better and broken boundaries on both sides of the line. <br/><br/>Although, it wasn't quite the constant arousal inducing spectacle of the book, it certainly got the juices flowing, so to speak, and was certainly worth watching. Even if it was a bit like trying to watch yourself roll your own eyes in the mirror, I will want to see the theatrical ending at some point, not to forget the next movie. Also something I've been wanting to do, but haven't so as to give this film a chance, is read the book again. That way I'll be able to check, did I really fail to recognise the characters I enjoyed so much when reading it a few years ago? Or should the director be the one deserving of punishment, now, instead of the adorable Ana?!"
"inell_hite","7","3","7","17 June 2015"," Not THAT bad..
","I read all three books, and I hate to read lol. Idk maybe it was hard to stretch out 350 pages to a hour and a half. Or maybe they couldn't fit it idk. The acting ehh, wasn't horrendous. They could have found a better Grey, to me he wasn't attractive at all, not alone the drop dead gorgeous man James described in the book. I think Ana was played very well. She seemed very innocent and sexually lacking, just like in the book so idk why people expected ""more sex appeal"" from her. She was a virgin, HELLO!! Anyway, I think whoever read the book should watch. It's always fun to me to compare. This is something I actually watched before AND after I read. Can't wait until the next one comes out. I do hope by then the actors can do a better job acting. I wish they would replace Grey but it really wouldn't be right being it would be a sequel. All this nonsense about domestic violence is ridiculous. The ""worse form of punishment"" scene may be straddling the fence, but other than that you cannot compare the two. The BDSM relationship is kind of the basis of the story and this man, so people complaining about him being controlling is pointless, what else did you expect? Then I take it they didn't read the book. Like I said before, if you read the book you should watch. If not, this really wouldn't be your movie. You wouldn't understand and would be compelled to post bad reviews and walk out demanding refunds. Smh at that still."
"mcampbelljh1","2","3","7","15 June 2015"," Sex may sell but a story helps..
","I don't fault the actors who had to perform to this script which was void of anything meaningful or redeeming. The only saving grace was the likability of the actress playing Anastasia. She had potential which was wasted in this movie. <br/><br/>Sex is one thing embedded in a good story it can even add some interest. This is not. <br/><br/>How this book was ever so widely read is beyond me. To make a movie out of this crap was really bad decision making by the studio exec who approved it.<br/><br/>All this movie was is soft porn. Like a porn movie it had no plot or story line. Skip it and find a real story to watch."
"rfayz","1","3","7","13 June 2015"," Man, you swallowed those blue pills faster than any previous victim
","If the title 50 Shades of Grey, aside from the obvious play off a character name, is meant to imply some sort of moral ambiguity or complexity on the subject of love, sex, and kink, then there is definitely a case for a class action law suit here.<br/><br/>Full disclosure: I have not read the book. I know some who have read it, in full and in part. The impression I got from what talk I heard of the book was that it was just an unusually successful dirty book. I'm male, I have access to the internet, and don't feel enough of a sense of guilt over my dirty thoughts to have to dress them up in a story to read to give them good taste. Now, for the romantically inclined who are rolling their eyes right now, I beg you to not misunderstand me. I do have a sense of romance, and can enjoy a romantic story. If the movie is any kind of reflection on the book, however, you won't find any romance there. That isn't itself a bad thing if the movie is just serving to scratch an erotic itch for you. I'm willing to bet this movie will fail miserably in that department for you as well.<br/><br/>The principle issue with this movie as romance is both characters seem to suffer from some form of personality disorder. Our male lead, the not-so-secretly kinky billionaire Christian Grey, is supposed to be the archetype of the bad boy the female gets to ""fix"" and settle down with but this aspect of his character is handled with no grace at all. The script literally has him telling us that characterizations of him being heartless are based on just simple fact. He warns her, in about three different ways, that he and the whole love thing don't mix. He's in the market for a sex slave and¬Ö he is more than willing to engage in polite and professional negotiations about it while he cuddles with you in the bath, and takes you to dinner with his family. Aside from the contradictions, he also suffers from Twilight syndrome in that most of his words and actions would be huge red flags that would have any woman reaching for a Taser or panic whistle and running.<br/><br/>Not a problem for the sheltered Anastasia Steele. (Excuse me as I groan every time I speak that name). Upon meeting the apparently dreamy Grey she offers very little hesitation in the ""play room"" and seems to be having a good time in the steamy scenes¬Ö that she judges him intensely for because they are painful and demeaning. There is the most hilarious example of this that I can't even give you as it would qualify as a spoiler being essentially the end of the film.<br/><br/>If you wanted to see this film because of the sexual content, lower your expectations. The movie is rated R, there is nudity and simulated sex. Most of the ""kink"" is in dialog, and the two actors have zero chemistry with each other. The lack of chemistry combined with awkward and questionable character behavior throw a cold shower on any eroticism. One odd note, if you're a straight male whose girl wants you watch this with her, don't worry, it was directed by a straight guy who apparently had little regard for this movie's target audience. It suffers terribly from male gaze, as the camera is on the woman way more than the man. As I said though, it's little comfort as the scenes just don't work. I watched this with a friend and we were hoping the much cuter guy who shows up for a few seconds in one scene in the hardware store would appear again.<br/><br/>To readers who have seen this movie, can someone help me? There is a scene where Anastasia wakes to find ""eat me"" and ""drink me"" signs on the bed side table, and the ""eat me"" tray looks like it has big blue pills. Are these pills? Are they candy? Can someone tell me what they are? I've never seen anything like it and I certainly wouldn't have popped them in my mouth without a second thought! Is this a Matrix sequel? Seriously, the blue pills are bothering me!"
"jtamargo","8","3","7","3 April 2015"," Hot and steamy
","I really enjoyed this movie. I would change the rating to adult as the subject matter is more adult oriented. I believe there are many phases having to do with the subject matter of Mr. Grey's preferences. Ms. Steele's curiosity about Mr. Grey's background leading to his preferences were perfectly played by Dakota Johnson. She was very believable as the innocent Anastasia Steele. Jamie Dornan is so convincing as Mr. Grey. I like how his character handles Anastasia. The door to the future is left open for anything and everything concerning these two. I will be waiting for anything that Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson do together as they do have good chemistry on screen."
"shubham-bhute16","1","3","7","20 March 2015"," The editing, awful.
","The movie clearly loses its plot at the start of the story. Background score is good but the pace of the story does't match it. Acting is below average which fades the chemistry between the original characters. Some unnecessary scenes at incompatible situations makes the story boring. The camera work is flawless but doesn't balance other mistakes. Talking on the pace of the movie, it slows down eventually and story goes nowhere. Those are the times during any movie when you feel you should check out our cell phone or something to just let pass the time. Though the movie is of about just more than two hours, there's not much material. Conclusion: The book is better than the movie."

","As probably many men before I was dragged into the movie by my girlfriend and a common friend of ours. At least I was paid both the entry and the tortillas with cheese sauce because otherwise I would have left the movie after the first 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Note I haven't read the book so I'm only rating the move here.<br/><br/>ACTING: I really find it hard to understand how the main roles can be cast so badly. Both Christian and Anastasia seemed to display no credible emotions until the very end. Beside that the few emotions Ana actually displayed were too cheese even for movies from the 60s. E.g. That constant lip-biting and leading the pencil to her lips can't be considered serious acting. This might have worked during the glorious times of Marilyn Monroe but today the image of a naive and innocent girl is just too outdated and not credible at all.<br/><br/>PLOT: What plot? After we left the cinema my girlfriend actually told me she missed some major plot. The whole movie resolves around how Ana meets Christian and is more and more subdued to him until she suddenly realizes he's a sick psycho when he hits her with his belt six time at the end of the movie as a form of punishment.<br/><br/>MESSAGE AND PG-RATING: I don't know about any other countries but the movie is rated 16 here in Germany. I seriously don't understand why. The movie clearly displays abuse of women because the obviously more sexually experienced Grey takes advantage of Anas naivety to virtually make her his sex-slave. There are several nude scenes involved where you can see bare breasts and buttocks. Just this alone should have called for an 18 rating. About the message of the movie? I don't know, but one has to be seriously naive in order to believe that a relationship like that one between Ana and Christian can actually work with one of them deciding over every aspect of their sexuality. <br/><br/>Wasted time, there's nothing else to say here."
"ivana-grloman","5","3","7","17 March 2015"," Better than the book
","I can understand the bad reviews this movie got, since it had a bad scenario to start with. The book is pure example of trashy literature and I'm surprised that they even managed to make the movie that is more bearable than the book itself. To be honest, I'm so happy i didn't have to hear once again those stupid Anastasia Steel monologues all through the book and the famous inner goddess bs.. or the annoying remarks about price tags.. <br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is, these guys who made the movie deserve a recognition for making it better then the book, which is very hard to achieve these days since it's always other way around.<br/><br/>It's not hard to enjoy this movie once you silence the desire to experience something uplifting or new or in anyway creative, and once you convince yourself to just want to be entertained by a fairy tail like soft-porn story. <br/><br/>My first attempt to watch the movie was a fail, I stopped after the interview part, annoyed by stupid , clich√© like scene where she falls while entering his office.. After few days I tried again watching just to see then end, and after 30 minutes I'd say movie kind of hits on and might appeal to women just because you get the feeling..OK, she is not trying to be a complete dumb chick...don't ask me why, that is the only plus point that I see in this movie.. <br/><br/>Both actors are in my opinion fine, for what is asked from them they did their part and I don't think other pairing would have done it better..I'd like just to express my condolence to them for making bad decision to be part of a movie that will just drag them down with it. Don't get me wrong.. there are worse movies.. just there is something about the thing when you decide to do a bad, almost pornographic movie...it kind of sticks in people's minds and we are easy to judge it if it fails to impress us.<br/><br/>And one last thing to add...the bad chronology of all three books will really mess up this movie..if they even think about making the sequel...

She wouldn't be able to walk, nor go for a next round right after. It's completely crap.<br/><br/>Now for the movie itself, I watched it because most times movies don't follow the books very well. I watched this and some parts were sexy and others not so much, such as the beatings. Yes, the guy was pretty sexy and had a sexy voice. However, what I was expecting was a lot more ravishing I guess. No woman is going to be aroused by this, some parts yes like what he says. <br/><br/>I knew all along that when people who are into ""rape"" themed sex on paper saw this, they might rethink that after seeing that crap with their own eyes.

","I can honestly say that whatever marketing company marketed this book must be amazing, any company that can get masses and masses to spend money on such despicably written insult to literature must be amazing. The only feat is on the marketing company for the movie as well. Such trash. Makes me ashamed that I am a woman and the success of this franchise makes me realize that indeed women are stupid and men treat us like idiots because general population of women who contribute to the popularity of this series shows just that. Also it is clearly an indication of how much of women are sexually repressed and unhappy with their sex lives that even such badly written stuff helps them imagine a better sex life. I am so glad that no respectable actors have accepted to be part of this movie, I would have hated to see any decent actors reputation be tarnished with this movie. The actors are awful, Mr Grey looks like the dude from Cruel intentions with curly blonde hair had a love child with Barney from how i met your mother and he is the resultant weird looking kid. Anastasia (i even hate her name) needs to get her nose done! I never encourage plastic surgery but my god the girl could use it, get some lip fillers, decent teeth. Actually she should stop appearing on screen bcos she is so displeasing to see. Everyone in this movie is awful at acting. In defense of the actors it would have been near impossible to produce decent acting with those awful lines and scenes anyway and all the actors are straight from starbucks i presume so considering that...they are barely alright... Also no human ever lives this storyline ever, none of those sentences were ever said by anyone ever. Also casting what looks like a 35 year old for the role of a virgin? deserves a belly laugh really, she has crows feet and lines all over her face and the fact that her teeth are mostly worn away from the fact that she is OLD. If the writer of The story of O was alive she would have sued that her amazing book has been reduced to this...this is basically twilight mashed badly with the story of o. its a sham and just like this stupid modern culture that allows Kim kardashian to be famous and miley cyrus to sell records so these kinds of trash makes it to the bookshelves and to the movies and does well and nurtures the ongoing success of bad mass produced books and movies that make younger generations stupider and stupider.

I spent the entire length of the movie wishing I was anywhere else in the world. <br/><br/>There was so little chemistry between Christian and Ana that the view has a tough time believing they are falling in love. Ana is basically an abused woman who doesn't know enough to leave the man who is abusing her.<br/><br/>Although, I must admit, movie Ana is slightly less annoying than book Ana, which is good because I don't think I could have handled 2 hours of that annoying crybaby. I get that her character is supposed to be naive, but she doesn't have the maturity of a woman who just graduated college with a degree in English Lit. She has the vocabulary of a teenager, which makes watching sex scenes extremely awkward and uncomfortable.<br/><br/>As for Christian being sexy? Jamie Dornan is hot. Absolutely. Christian, on the other hand isn't. I thought maybe they'd make him more likable than his character in the book, but I just don't find what boils down to physical abuse sexy. <br/><br/>The movie touches on the sub/dom culture, but in the end, it's as though it was written by a 14 year old girl with no sexual experience to draw on. The main characters are flat, and the secondary characters aren't developed at all. Kate seems flaky, Jose seems like a stalker, and Elliot seems like an idiot. Ana's mom seems like she is on some sort of drugs and Christians family is super creepy. Not sure if it's bad casting or bad writing.<br/><br/>See it if you must, but I don't recommend this to anyone. There are so many better ways to spend 2 hours out there!"

I don't recommend this movie to anyone because it's a big pile of nothing, the ending was so awful it didn't conclude anything about this movie. BIG WASTE OF TIME! If you want to see some movies a little similar to this than watch ""Basic Instinct 1 & 2"", trust me you will save 125 minutes of your time not watching ""Fifty Shades of Grey""!"

","Poor, poor movie. I don't even know where to start. This is probably the 2014 movie that managed to have a great box office, and be the worst movie of 2014. Don't expect anything of this movie. All you should expect is, bad acting, bad movie editing, bad cinematography, bad everything. The storyline escalates too quickly and yet the film is boring. The dialogs are terrible and honestly if you want to see something related to this genre, just open your google browser and search for porn.

","50 Shades of Grey is without a doubt the worst box-office hit that Hollywood has ever produced.<br/><br/>It's an (unintentionally) hilarious tale of two dimwitted individuals who have an absurd sex affair. Certain Anastasia Steele, a virginal student, is so horny that she apparently can't figure out that a douchey billionaire Christian Grey who wants to spank her ass, might actually hurt her. So to figure this out, she ASKS him to whip her ass really hard. And when he does, she gets upset and leaves, thus concluding the ""romance"". It's pure comedy gold.<br/><br/>None of the characters have any idea why they do or say things, and neither do the actors. The whole story is filled with contradictions and even paradox. The script in this movie is truly something special. To see two grown-up people trying to utter those asinine lines and making total fools out of themselves is why this may be worth watching. They were sitting there behind a conference table and discussing anal fisting and butt plugs like two politicians who are negotiating a peace treaty.<br/><br/>Neither actor has much to go on with in terms of characterization. Their characters can only be objectively described using oxymorons. Dakota Johnson who plays Anastasia sticks with shy schoolgirl routine. Jamie Dornan who plays Christian sticks with being confused or annoyed. Sam Taylor-Johnson who plays the director apparently has no clue about what to do with this mess either. She was basically handed an explicit porno book ... uh, I mean ""erotic romance"" and asked to make it into an R-rated movie. So she cleaned it up, made it pretty and shiny. The music tracks play almost non-stop in this movie. Rumor has it that E.L. James (the wicked witch who spawned this 50 shades franchise) was haunting the production set and screaming in a bullhorn, ""Don't touch my story. Undress Jamie Dornan now!!!"" Maybe this is why the pacing is out of whack and editing is strange at some places.<br/><br/>The ""erotic"" scenes are by far the most boring part of the film. When Grey made a speech and said, ""I don't make love, I flog hard"", for some reason I expected to see Jason Statham vs. Amy Smart type of action (Crank). Instead we get a few sleep-inducing commercials for hygiene products loosely inspired by 9 and 1/2 weeks. Anastasia gets blindfolded all the time which paralyzes her and makes her gasp for air. Not sure why. The so-called S&M sequence was a welcome comic relief though. Someone decided it would be funny to accompany this burlesque show montage by ""Crazy in Love"" song played at 1/2 speed. They were right because it made Beyonce sound a bit.. stoned.<br/><br/>So there you have it. Cheesy, sanitized, visual re-enactment of atrociously written porn fanfic, which in terms of filmmaking fails to measure up even to the crappiest sexploitation flicks from the 70s, somehow grosses half a billion. Isn't that true magic of cinema, or what? Well done, Universal. This thing was promoted and advertised in every corner of this planet, from Cambodia to Zimbabwe. And the person who thought it should be marketed as a romantic Valentine's Day movie certainly deserves some sort of award. Maybe a golden cactus butt plug or something, because that was pure genius. <br/><br/>I normally don't rate movies with ones or tens, for even the worst movies (I've seen) have some sort of creative spark behind them. or at the very least serve as means for some silly people to express themselves. But in this case, I fail to see anything other than desire to exploit gullible masses and make profit out of nothing. A product of abysmal quality that was simply slapped together and put in pretty packaging to be marketed and sold -- not dissimilar to the malfunctioning 50 Shades lube (no joke)."

","This is my first review but I had to write something about this movie. It was a very disappointing one. I left the movie half way through. Christian seemed pretending to be someone he clearly wasn't. Anna was better in her performance but soon joined Christian's league. In the beginning of the movie, I got a feeling that Anna was trying to be intimated by Christian more than Christian doing something to intimidate her at the interview. He almost seemed boyish. When Anna trips at the door to Christian's cabin, it was one of the most predictable scenes that one could see. Their discussions over the clauses in the agreement for whatever he wanted to do, was a joke. It was a very wooden performance. This subject did not seem to be a new one but even with that, they could have made a much better movie had they not tried to force a wolf's skin over a lamb."

HORRIBLE cinematography, scenes didn't transition smoothly and it left you feeling very awkward. The two unfortunately did not pull off the desire the books makes you feel during the sex scenes. In the book Christian Grey is seen as a serious, no messing around guy but the entire time he talks in the movie, Dornan is smirking oddly and doesn't give the same ominous sex appeal that is so vividly described in the books. Also, the entire time in the movie all I could hear was Dornan's thick accent.

","So... the much anticipated literary phenomenon that is Fifty Shades of Grey will now forever be known as the biggest flop and worst literature to film conversion known to man of that I am certain!<br/><br/>It's so bad that it surpasses some attempts by Hollywood to convert classics like Austen and Dickens to film and the actors either had American accents (which is weird considering they were set in say Victorian England) or worst still the ""English"" accents of said American actors or vice versa (the Americans sound more Australian or South African and the English sound like country hillbillies which is painful to experience) <br/><br/>I was well aware that this movie was the bread part of the 50 shades trilogy (the books all three, kind of like a sandwich, book 1 & 3 are a bit bland you are not sure what the fuss is about but the filling part of the sandwich, book 2 convince you that the overall sandwich is not bad, but a sandwich is still a sandwich, you're not going to get a gourmet experience but it's better than dry bread) so my expectations were not high but it was just so blah! There was the general lack of passion or feeling, the sex yeah whatever, it doesn't automatically depict either passion or feeling and considering the film weighs on the two leads it missed the mark by a continent. <br/><br/>First Jamie Dorman + Christian Grey = wrong! Without going into the bad casting choice, his looks etc... he is fifty shades of f***ed up so is it so wrong to actually want to see a range of fifty different emotions on his face and I am so over the dark and broody Edward Cullen/Mr Darcy I'm so tortured hero routine (ironic I know since fifty shades began as a Twilight FF). Can a girl not get a witty, charismatic anti-hero with underlying sarcasm like Jane Eyre's Mr Rochester because without it we get the Mr Grey they just gave us, who kind of comes across as a creep (all those online memes from a few years ago about the books begin to make sense). Then Dakota Johnson's Anastasia generally had no problem with her, she was exactly the kind of mousy I expected, (no female empowerment there) but the last scene, Anastasia's reaction to the beating and though I have never experienced corporal punishment in that situation but I am no stranger to it from my childhood and let me tell you after what she experienced be it 6 or 60 hits with a belt... when the shock wears off the rage is of such a magnitude you have planned in your mind murder and revenge in 100 different ways, and then comes the shame and self-loathing and yet she, Anastasia... cool as a cucumber, a few crocodile tears -_- <br/><br/>So to overall it was just cringe and the two stars I gave it was actually for the soundtrack, the best part of the movie was its movie soundtrack"

","I am a huge fan of the book. I love that it's different from any romance novel I know. But this movie which is an adaption to the book that I refer to is really disappointing. I think Jamie should return to acting school because the only thing that is good about him is his look and if that is the only good thing about him than he should have been a model not an actor. I love Dakota. I think she is funny and beautiful in a way that not many people see. The lack of chemistry in this movie does not go unnoticed and of course that is another disappointment from this movie. And maybe for those who have read the book, I believe you notice that the story in this movie was told way too fast. This is the main problem that I have with the movie. It's just too fast! They forgot to put many little details from the book into the movie and because of that I could not have the same connection with the movie that i have with the book. For those who haven't read the book, I suggest you not to watch this movie because you WILL be disappointed with this movie, especially if you are just curious about all the hype that is fifty shades of grey.

(If one can even consider Twilight fan-fic a real novel..)<br/><br/>Needless to say I had very low expectations going into this film, and my expectations were mostly correct. There were a few nice set pieces, and a couple of moments where the filmmakers obviously tried to rise above their source material. That's the only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1.. <br/><br/>Aside from a few OK scenes though, this movie is mostly awful.. There was NO chemistry between the two leads IMO. And for a movie whose subject matter is based almost entirely around S&M, there was extremely little to be found here. I did not expect the film to be a pornography, but considering the book reads like grocery store soft-core, I was surprised that the movie was so tame.

Done in the style of other erotic dramas‚Äîie. 9-1/2 Weeks, Eyes Wide Shut, Unbearable Lightness of Being and Last Tango in Paris‚Äîthis film differed by focusing more on the fringe life style of sadomasochistic sex. Unfortunately, even the most brilliantly filmed sex acts are a bore without a story to support it‚Äîno exposition of characters, no climax, no conclusion. <br/><br/>Former model Jamie Dornan portrays Christian, a successful and confident telecommunications executive and self-made millionaire who is so intrigued by Anastasia, a recent college graduate who interviews him on his biography, that he manipulatively seduces her into his private sanctuary of sadomasochism. <br/><br/>The lead characters spend so much time exploring each other's animal appetites that there is little time for dialogue. And, what dialog exists leads the audience on and on with no explanation of why the dominant Dornan became such a recluse that he compels his submissive mistresses to sign a lawyer-approved unorthodox non-disclosure agreement for engaging in a sexual relationship with him. <br/><br/>While newcomer, Dakota Johnson, does an amiable job of portraying Anastasia, an intellectual virgin probing the enlightening world of power and sex, Jamie Dornan's character is so unemotional and so lacking in personality that he should stay out of movies and stay on magazine covers. I expected at least some kind of interesting plot justifying Christian's perpetual rebuking of Anastasia's affection and his contempt for her curiosity in her trying to learn about his ""troubled past."" The movie seemed to be building to some sort of thematic climax but the ending was so abrupt that I was surprised and disappointed to see the credits roll. This was no Last Tango in Paris and not even in the same league with 9-1/2 weeks. This film is as much of an enigma as its title. <br/><br/>By Chris Kaufmann"

Christian acts more like a stalker and serial killer than a person or even a guy wanting to like not even love her. The whole sex/tie up/spanking/blindfolding (that is not even a tie-up game) session is more like a spider tying up a dumb fly than bondage at all.

","Fifty Shades of Grey captivated women's minds everywhere. It had them all enthralled in the world of BDSM and excited them to new possibilities of pleasure. This movie, however, does not do that. The actors Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson have very little to no on screen chemistry. Where Christian Grey is supposed to be seductive he comes across as abusive. The stiff, unfeeling, almost uncomfortable portrayal of the character detracts from the audiences willingness to fall in love with him. There is no charm. Dakota Johnson proves herself to be new to the silver screen. She's awkward. Throw the two stiffs together naked and it just makes it worse. Their robotic sex scenes don't make you squirm in your seat with anticipation. They don't end leaving you satisfied. In fact it's more like a sex education video where it's so scientific it's not sexy. Their scenes together are devoid of the passion that is essential to any remotely romantic movie.<br/><br/>Sam Taylor-Johnson was a poor choice to direct this purported ""erotic drama."" Her angles were questionable and the way she directed the actors was uninspired. It was as if she marathon-ed the Twilight Saga and told them to mimic their respected counter parts. The result is a drab retelling of the national bestseller. She also chose to downplay their sexual encounters, so that instead of steamy sex scenes you get some PG- 13 love scenes. There is almost no nudity and very few swear words. If she had just allowed it to be more lewd or less naked then she would've had a movie worth seeing on her hands. A more aggressive approach to their physical encounters and pleasure would have improved the quality of enjoyment for all involved.<br/><br/>The plot line is also a problem but there was nothing the movie makers could have done there as it follows the book precisely (minus a few sex scenes.) Nothing of consequence happens to actually make it feel like you are watching a story. Instead it's as if you're listening to a boring friend regale you with their boring love life.<br/><br/>Good points about this movie: <br/><br/>Marcia Gay Harden makes an appearance as Christian's mother. <br/><br/>The Red Room was actually pretty impressive.<br/><br/>Anastasia Steel's red dress (The one that she wears while negotiating the contract) was lovely.<br/><br/>The lighting for the movie was beautiful throughout.<br/><br/>This movie is one that you can skip.

","I was sorely disappointed by this films overall lack of details... Not in terms of the sex, but in key elements that were relatively crucial moments in the book. Of course the actors cast for the roles ( all roles) have much to do with my disappointment in this film. Sadly, Jamie Doran, as adorable as he is, was the wrong man to portray Grey and Johnson... Somehow she reminds me of Kristin Stewart, whom I personally think is the worst actress to ever be blessed with hit roles & movies in the Twilight Saga. OK, so I went a little off track, Johnson isn't that bad, maybe even a great actress in other roles... But perhaps it was the overall disappointment in the screenplay that made me cringe during this film. I was not expecting this movie to be as 'B' rated as it was. √∞≈∏‚Äò≈Ω√∞≈∏‚Äò≈Ω"

I can't believe people compare this movie with raping woman, does person clear doesn't know a sh..t what that mean.Other way there wouldn't be so many women submitting so many plastic Surgeries, to look people are not real. I really enjoy the book and the movie, Its very sensual and exiting point of view this book had about relationship between woman and men. of course in an movie or book the fiction are more exaggerated than the reality. I don't really see any men smelling an underwear the way Christian does. But i think most of the woman who are in a relationship or marriage will like to have Christian grey looking into your eyes and saying:"" I don't make love ...I just f...k hard"". Just the little passion any relationship needs. Not to much and not to little."

However I think the only one that was even slightly similar to the book was Jamie Dorman(Christian Grey) the rest of the acting was cheesy and just awful. <br/><br/>Disappointing doesn't even come close to how me and a few friends felt, it made us feel physically annoyed at how they completely destroyed the imagery of the book, they missed out every crucial part to the book, the ending was just god-damn awful as well it didn't even go through the entire scene between her and Christian. <br/><br/>This is definitely a film I think that should be started from scratch and re-done and directed completely by E.L.James as she is the only one that clearly seems to have the right creativity to produce something like this. <br/><br/>To some it up. <br/><br/>Don't Waste Your Money!"

","After watching the movie, I cannot stop being disappointed for almost every single moment throughout the entire film! It just, you know, kind of having so many confusing scenes which causes audiences misunderstand what's going on, what the film actually features about. One more point is that the film doesn't show how important the 2 main character are because they played their scenes constrainedly. I think that they should have some more scenes so that they can link together and make the audience easily get to the main aim of the director or the film maker. For the rest of the series, they should have considered more about which necessary scenes they should put on so that the audience can enjoy them positively not like with the first one."

","It is finally here, the movie every housewife saw opening weekend and every boyfriend was dragged to, and i feel sorry for what they had to sit through for two hours. For a book that was so highly praised by so many people this film was all kinds of terrible, from it's plot (or lack thereof) to its characters and dialogue this movie just failed to deliver in any way. Now i know i am not the target audience for this film but even if i am not the target audience i have to be able to have at least a half decent time watching it. Right from the very first Anastasia and Christian scene this move was just so cringe-worthy and a complete bore-fest. This movie did a terrible job of creating and introducing these characters, one comes across as a weird, over-controlling freak (some words i cannot include here) and the other a very confused ,dumb and poorly written woman. Whoever wrote the dialogue for this film whether it was the same as the novel or updated for the film needs to retire their writing career because the conversations between the two leads are so boring, all the lines seem very fake, like this writer has never had a normal human conversation. Most of this crappy dialogue is the writer's fault for writing it but also Jamie Dornan was just completely bland in this role, his delivery of the lines were so robotic and fake that you didn't buy what they were saying for a second. I do believe that Anastasia did a half decent job while having to portray one of the dumbest characters who is completely incapable of making any kind of rational decision. Her scenes when she is away from Christian are more bearable, it is when they are together that it just gets unbearable to watch.<br/><br/>Now, the plot was just so plain and simple that for a whole 2 hours the movie went absolutely nowhere. The movie was not building up to any kind of event, it was just a series of conversations and sexual activities all spaced out over the two hours. Whoever read the script and thought that THIS would be able to capture the viewers attention the whole time was dead wrong. This film did its very best to make me fall asleep, but i fought it because i had to see what stupidity they would come up with next to keep the film going. This film was just filled with many, many weird and awkward conversations that just make you wonder why on earth this woman is interested in this man and why this man is so interested in this woman. With a bit of unsexy sex thrown in there a few times and one of the worst endings in film history this movie was a disaster waiting to happen. If it wasn't for Dakota Johnson actually making her character at times amusing this would have somehow been even lower. - 2.9/10"

If you've taken the time to read the books, and if you do waste two hours of your life on this movie you'll realize how bad the movie skips around making no sense at parts. My cousin will hate me forever now that I made him go see it with me. In the book it's about 2 people that are gorgeous obviously, why the hell did they cast Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan!? The other guys in the movie were all hotter than Christian! And as for the raunchy sex scenes, well sorry but not raunchy enough in my opinion. If you're going to make a dirty book into a movie go with a porn company and do it big, do it right. Give us all what we want. And use a sexier cast please. I've seen better acting in porn movies haha. It doesn't even deserve one star. Oh and for them to go into such specific detail about what Taylor looks like in the book and to make him some creepy white guy in the movie was just wrong!"

","Not sure what all the fuss is about I really enjoyed this film as did most people I know that has seen it, but I guess everyone has to be a critic! I have read the book which firstly I think helps! you need to understand the characters. I think Dakota Johnson was a perfect Ana, the way she portrayed her nervousness, insecurity and her innocents and the growth that is shown as the plot develops. She nailed Ana which was a hard thing to do because the book itself was based much upon her internal dialog. And Jamie Dornan was the perfect Mr Grey! he really did a great job portraying Christian's mystery, moodiness and tortured soul. And As for the people who are saying it insights abuse etc. They need to understand that Ana has all the power she's is the one who is calling the shots. People need to look past the 'sex' and see the story for what it is. I have seen movies which demonstrate much worse! like glorification of murder, drugs and violence. Yet people are up in arms about some consensual spanking? really!! <br/><br/>I think they did a good job getting it all into one movie. but I think they missed a few key elements that would have helped understand the characters better but all up I loved it! the soundtrack the acting all of it! and as I suspect the next ones like the books will only get better as it goes deeper into the storyline and characters."

","There is much talk about 21st century women turning away from emancipation. Or at least from inconvenient parts of it, like struggling, uniting, committing, and unattractive hassles like 'thinking things through thoroughly'. 50 Shades of Grey is part of that movement, but more importantly: the audience full of bitter 40-something women are exactly that.<br/><br/>There is something very wrong with the semi-whispered remarks, the uncomfortable giggles and the disingenuous laughter - the atmosphere in the theater is almost poisonous. Come to think of it: the atmosphere is somewhere around 5 shades of grey, all shades in the very dark and gloomy spectrum. I used to find these observations about 'women my age' confusing and worrying, but nowadays I find them fascinating, so I sat all the way through this movie. What an insufferable drag.<br/><br/>Days later I ran across a remark from Jim Jefferies: ""To all the people that like 50 Shades of Grey... Have you heard about porn? I think it will blow your mind!"". That says it all - happy April 18th y'all!"
"Kaelhin","8","3","7","23 February 2015"," Not all bad
","I know this movie has gotten completely panned. But as a reader of the books, I wasn't expecting much, knowing the graphic content. In fact I really didn't want to see all that was explained and explored in the book. Some things are meant to be left to the imagination.<br/><br/>That being said, I actually thought the movie was just fine. It kept mostly true to the book. Though, I wish they could have included more of the quick banter and smart wit between their emails...and also include more of Grey's actually ""trying"" to be the better / more romantic boyfriend. <br/><br/>It ended just as the first book did and just as I had expected. Which for those readers who couldn't get beyond the shock of their sudden separation, is a real travesty. Because in the future books and as the story goes, their real relationship and love and trust is built and real love story grows. While it's a warp-speed relationship, Its not any worse than The Bachelor on a speed dating / courtship kind of way. <br/><br/>And for those of us not into Bondage and Master/Servant relationships, I thought this was a very tasteful way to explore that side of some people without being completely porn. The ""Red Room of Pain"" was actually quite intriguing and almost beautiful. <br/><br/>Anyway, not sure if there is ever going to be a Movie 2 or 3...given the current state of the actors. Seeing Jamie Dornan's interviews, while I LOVE him in The Fall and on OUAT, I could tell he was very awkward talking about the film. Especially due to his wife and child. I get that. But he is also in the acting business and the Hollywood industry. If she can't get over it, then he'll have to quit or they'll split. It's just part of the job. We're all grown adults here and it s a shame that it would pull away from all the acting he can do.<br/><br/>For a crazy, raunchy subject, I thought the movie was quite tasteful in what it portrayed. I'm a hopeless romantic and while this type of relationship is not for me it was interesting to see it portrayed. I am hoping that movies 2 & 3 will help see it through to the end and have a Happy Ending."
"herbqedi","8","3","7","23 February 2015"," Well-directed and well-acted voyeurism delivers well on its objective
","I come to the movies to be entertained. I was very much entertained. I came this movie partially to see a character study featuring a virgin on the verge of college graduation coming of age at the hands of a self-advertised millionaire sadist who considers himself soulless. That is precisely what i got. THe other attraction of this movie, of course, was the opportunity to watch B & D sex set against a trashy love/lust story. This obviously is not for all tastes but just as obviously, given the box office, attracts many and half of the people I know who went once have now gone twice. <br/><br/>I see a lot of IMDb critics giving this movie one star on the basis of calling it soft porn. I won't deny that this film is right on the edge of soft porn and that if you don't like voyeuristic sex and soft porn, you should not go into the theater. Is there anyone who bought a ticket who did not know to expect ""the sexual abuse of a young woman being used as supposed entertainment."" I read this quote verbatim in at least three reviews. Like anything else, if you know you find such things so abhorrent, that's all you'll think about, then you SHOULD NOT GO to see this film.<br/><br/>Me, I like well-made soft-porn laced with occasional humor. As someone with what I consider a healthy and open-to-anything libido, I also enjoy watching naked bodies engage in kinky sex, especially when set up properly. For this kind of movie, the direction was incredibly crisp and cogent. Christian Grey was exactly the menacing, narcissistic yet charming control freak he was supposed to be. I found it impossible not to be overwhelmed and seduced by his power. I certainly found it easy to believe that Dakota Johnson would be. Marcia Gay Harden's brief turn as Grey's adopted mother is wonderful. <br/><br/>Even the many one-star haters seem to indicate that the direction and pacing (fantastic in my opinion) were not bad. I would say the best I've ever seen in a borderline soft-porn movie and among the best I've every seen for a trashy love story (Think Butterfly, The Other Side of Midnight, and Once is Not Enough). I'd also ask how a movie with decent direction could get ONE star (3 o4 4 would be more reasonable). I reserve ONE STAR for total disasters with totally incompetent direction like Homer and Eddie. This was slick, well-directed, and in my opinion (perhaps the biggest actually pertinent major disagreement with the critics) uniformly well-acted especially by the supporting cast and Johnson. I also did find the chemistry electric with Jamie properly stiff when he found himself confused by letting Anastasia into a heart he had blockaded and a soul he was convinced he didn't have.<br/><br/>As for the bodies shown, the nudity, the devices, and the choreography of the sex, I've never seen better. One problem I generally have with the borderline soft porn genre is spending two much time on mechanics. Most movies based on trashy novels also spend too much time dwelling on emotionally ravaged faces not quite executed bu mediocre actors. This movie never stopped coming at you with excitement, intrigue, and sex long enough to stagnate like that. <br/><br/>So, I had a great time and enjoyed it thoroughly and most of the 100+ women and 8 other men in the audience seemed to enjoy it on that basis as well. After all, they got what they knew they were coming to see."
"Mr Nuff","3","3","7","21 February 2015"," A Review from Someone Who Likes This Stuff
","I'm a man in his early thirties who's written and read a decent amount of erotic fiction, most of it involving some sort of BDSM. Most of my relationships have been ""regular"", but I fancy myself a dominant when I am involved with a willing submissive. For this reason I had to see this movie (I hadn't read the book). I had to see if this movie was ""real"" BDSM and whether the main character was truly ""abusive"". I also had to see this movie because I couldn't trust any of the reviews. The first 10 or so user reviews on IMDb I've read rated the movie low because the main character was reportedly a bad guy or because they had high expectations for the dialogue. I didn't mind either of these flaws.<br/><br/>For those interested, yes, this is one representation of a BDSM relationship. While Anastasia is naive and apprehensive throughout most of the movie, there is sexual bondage, domination and submission, making it BDSM. Some of the action flirts the line of Safe, Sane and Consensual, but that doesn't change the definition of words. Christian Grey is somewhat abusive. There is nothing as bad as I've been led to believe, but there is severe jealousy and light stalking, not unlike you might see in a movie about a regular relationship. For me, the movie could still rate a 10, because I don't need all my main characters to have the golden morals of Superman. Flawed characters make for better stories. The problem with Fifty Shades is the *lack* of story.<br/><br/>The buildup is quite good. The characters aren't brilliant and the dialogue is definitely unnatural at times with Christian spouting one-liners reminiscent of made-for-TV movies. The sex scenes weren't overly titillating, but they were moderately hot and seemed to be edging closer to some hot grand finale. The actors are nice to look at in their barely-R-rated nude scenes. In my head, the movie was getting a 6/10 for the first 30 or so minutes.<br/><br/>But then the movie stalls. The characters stop growing, the plot goes in circles, you wonder where the chemistry went. Why do they still like each other? Finally, it's over before anything significant happens.<br/><br/>I can forgive lackluster dialogue and stereotypical characters, but the lack of sexy, BDSM, and plot in a sexy BDSM movie is unforgivable. Watch Secretary instead."
"girly_shu","7","3","7","20 February 2015"," There are some flaws but overall I enjoyed it.
","To start with I would say that the movie is hit and miss. I do not agree with the one-star reviews though. There is more to that 'porn' as some people are describing it and limiting it to. Some of the lines were a little ridiculous I agree. And some of the lines were pretty funny! So to me it was a little bit of comedy, erotica, drama, romance. I am still deciding how I feel about Dakota Johnson as Anastasia. At first I thought she was super awkward and shy and boring. But I think she became more and more confident as the movie progressed. She has some witty and funny lines. Jamie Dornan did a great job as Christian Grey. Of course as I woman I thought he was super hot and in the sex scenes, which by the way are done very well, he knew exactly what he was doing. I have not read the book so I did not know that it's not just about the sex in it. But the movie is clearly revealing that there is a deeper reason as to why Christian is how he is. I think the first movie was an exciting opening and definitely makes me want to see more and know what's going to happen next. I have friends that have read the books and say there is more unexpected to come. So I will definitely see the other movies."

The lack of Ethos made some parts early on in the movie a bit cringy. <br/><br/>I think the movie had good actors. The atmosphere in the movie was also really good.

","For some of you wonderful film lovers who perhaps know a little bit of life and the language of this art form, it will be hard to recommend Fifty shades of Grey. For the rest of you, if you hang in there for a while, you might see at least a particular body part you so craved, or, who knows, some new yoga move? Lets face it, sex or no sex, you have to admit, Dakota Johnson is a cute, if not interesting beauty to look at. She has the same gift her mother had. A vulnerable adorable charm that wins anyone with a heart over. Jamie Dornan, as Christian, seems to have let her down, aiming for the stilted brooding rich male - save for some, he's pleasing enough to look at. <br/><br/>Director Taylor Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel can both take the hit as a team for the soft stroking and pandering. Whether it was a choice to be conservative for the sake of Hollywood standards, or trying endlessly to tease us and keep us wanting more, they missed miserably and should donate their salaries to a battered women foundation. We have a right to expect more out of the shot list cannon, approaching the intensity of sexual relationships. The screenplay lacks any type of depth or daring beside simply hanging on and playing it safe to the book. (reminder hear to children reading, books work on a different tone and mood level than do films) Expect more! Though I like a little spice in my sauce, even if its just a little, this film is hardly brow raising and little to no breath of new air much less dirty mud in the sexual arena. There is more tantalizing sexual thrill on the local news channels. I can't go on. There is nothing here left to address. The Film cannon is little less than a soft porn. The acting, cinematography, and story is average at best. The directing could have been done by my mother. I think hi of my mother but she is no director. But I still think Dakota was the one bright spot, perhaps not so much in that she worked with very little else help, but because you can see to her shining potential. NOT ALL WILL BE LET DOWN? Of coarse not. People or the youth with less film knowledge or perhaps simple life experience will find it matching the tenors of the Twilight film saga. And then kids will want to know what all the hype is about. So I believe it might be an average film to see on one of the down loading sites. To the director; It is obvious that there is no good message here, If anything it speaks sadly to the state of these empty vessels you call characters. With that said, there is no 'pushing the envelope of seduction.' So Sam Taylor-Johnson why do it? Much less do it in such a boorish manner."

World record breaking cinema attendance.<br/><br/>It was a good erotic story. Well timed and the plot was well managed. I personally enjoyed the movie maybe because I never read the book. <br/><br/>Women starting losing it when the billionaire Christian Grey filled the screen at his office rocking a black suit but I later heard that he did not match the description from the book. Maybe Wentworth Miller would have done a splendid job with his huge sense of seductive charm. Voice. Aura. Facial expressions and so forth. But Jamie's appeal was more than enough.<br/><br/>The story was excellent and did cater for an intelligent audience. Women became bitter by the ending but I was only there for the ride. Maybe, if we could have it our way, have Tyler Perry write the screenplay. Yes explicitness is not his area but he would have worked around it.<br/><br/>Anastasia wasn't your Halle Berry hot but she killed it. Guess Hollywood are giving average looking females a chance. And I also guess casting a really attractive woman would be typical. Anastasia was just a student. And a virgin.<br/><br/>Some speculate that Ian Somerhalder would have been perfect as well or Jonathan Rhys Meyers but it doesn't matter now. The movie was shot down and killed.<br/><br/>I really believed that Christian was a billionaire because of the words that were coming out of his mouth. And his level of humility. He wasn't rude or trying to be an @ss. And neither did he avoid being one.<br/><br/>On the erotic part...Basic Instinct and Monster's Ball did it better."

"Myjoyandlight","4","3","7","14 February 2015"," Too tame but a little more tolerable than the book
","I found the hoopla surrounding Fifty Shades of Grey to be annoying and confusing. The book reads like a thirteen year old girl wrote it with added inspiration from watching her parent's assorted collection of adult videos. Therefore, I wasn't expecting much from the movie. I knew that it would at least be tolerable because we wouldn't have to hear the main character, Ana's, inner dialogue first person narrative: Holy cow, holy s***, oh my, my face is flushed, his gazing gray eyes, etc. (really, the first narrative was horrendous). I digress.<br/><br/>The movie was watchable; however, it was very tame. The sex scenes weren't anything out of the ordinary. In fact,I am sure that most movie goers and television watchers have seen the same if not more in other rated R movies and premium cable television shows. There was a little bit of spanking, which didn't come across as even naughty. There is tapping on the rear with a leather riding crop approximately two times, and a flogger is used very gently. Mr. Dornan stays clothed a lot, and Ms. Johnson bares it all in virtually all of the love scenes, which got rather old pretty fast. The true BDSM is nonexistent in the film. Why? The film company may not have been willing to deal with the backlash.<br/><br/>I believe that this story is fascinating because . . . Uh, I don't know why. The true highlight of the Fifty Shades of Grey movie is the soundtrack. That I actually paid money for, and I highly recommend spending your money on the soundtrack and calling it a day with Fifty Shades of Grey the movie unless you like being teased.<br/><br/>*On another note., Mr. Dornan plays the lead role as a serial killer on the show The Fall. His talent shows so much better than this movie. I suggest watching him play that role."
"Gordon-11","Null","7","23","15 February 2015"," Very enjoyable, much to my surprise
","This film tells the story of a university student who interviews a successful, young and handsome billionaire, Christian Grey. He falls for her, and they embark on a mind game of physical and mental control.<br/><br/>It turns out that ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is more a romantic film than a film about alternative sexual practice. Christian Grey is portrayed to be super handsome and charming. He has this irresistible charisma, and certainly knows how to make a lady smile. How Christian Grey charms Anastacia to be very sweet and Romantic. An yet, he has this dark side which needs to be unleashed. The film does not concentrate on this dark side, as Anastacia is actually so good at playing mind games with Christian. The end result is an engaging and intriguing struggle between the two.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", much to my surprise."

","I have NO idea why so many people are so judge-mental and critical against this film! If you like the book, you should like the film, it was pretty much the same, and I loved the book and loved the film. I personally thought Ana fit the description from the book perfectly, awkward nervous meek and shy, and Jamie Dornan did a perfect job at depicting the character of Christian, dominant, a bit cold and aloof, but also damn sexy and bossy and passionate. I thought the film was very well done and I liked it, so anyone who doesn't like it, well I think they're wrong. Stop judging this film so harshly and giving it such low ratings people, seriously, what's your problem."

I think the haters of this movie thought it would be an erotic adventure into the dark world of S & M..., where'as it was a thought provoking experience into the ""why"" of those into that lifestyle.

","I really don't understand what's the bad thing about the movie... People are giving their own reviews with the notion that this book and movie are real... It's call fiction , and there is nothing wrong about escaping reality once in a while ... After all that's what movies and books are all about, if we are going to criticize movies like that let's start with Disney movies ... Making little girls grow up with the notion that there is a Prince Charming when in reality there is no such thing...<br/><br/>I went to see the movie with the mentality that I will put faces on the character's from the book , so maybe that's why I wasn't disappointed I know that there is no way a 19 hour audio book can fit in a 2 hour movie... In my opinion the lead character's were amazing and they made it work with what little material they had...<br/><br/>The movie has humor, romance , erotic scenes etc... I believe people will like it if they just think outside the box, and look the movie as an escape to explore once sexuality, the movie or the book is not telling you to do all those things... I assume that we are mature enough to know that stalking is bad, and is all depends on how we interpret the movie or book. I always see movies and read books with an open mind, and a possibility for more this is a different kind of romance... <br/><br/>New things are not bad, don't give me wrong I love the old time romance but just because I love them that doesn't mean I need to lash out at another type of romance ... Like I said it's just a movie (Fiction)... Not reality so if you willing to see it that way you won't get disappointed after all we are not professional critics... We are just simple people given our own opinions..."

","I just have to say this is a GREAT movie and I can't wait until Fifty shades Darker is released. The way Christian Grey seems all gentleman on the outside and mysterious on the inside is how everyone seems in today's world. How the books and movie interpret a single persons life leaves people more comfortable with themselves. Some people will realize that their dark secrets wouldn't compare to others. Everyone seems mysterious at first until you get to know them and everything just slowly reveals itself like in the movie. <br/><br/>I am going to order it in advance like I did this one!!!!

"rjsf96","2","5","15","14 February 2015"," A Glorified Porno for Repressed Young Women
","Understandably you may have been led to believe from Fifty Shades of Grey's marketing that it is edgy, racy and sexy. It is none of the above, yes you heard me correct and have been sorely mislead, but at least the marketing was highly successful.<br/><br/>It is necessary to understand how the film came about, no pun intended. It was adapted from the poorly written book of the same name by ""author"" E. L. James, which in turn was adapted from a fan fiction of 'Twilight', all of this figures. Many of the plot points and events are parallels to the 'Twilight' saga and lines like ""I'm not the man for you"" feel directly lifted from it. <br/><br/>But at least the film gets some things right, which is another way of saying barely anything at all. The film is well shot which is unsurprising when it is Seamus McGarvey who photographed the exquisite Avengers. However, this becomes redundant when the film you are photographing is utter trite. <br/><br/>The music though, sounds like the things of wet dreams, yet never quite reaches the full potential of composer Danny Elfman, who is somewhat underutilized, as the majority of the film has techno pop songs thrown into the sound scape. 'Love Me Like You Do' is as expected the best element of Fifty Shades and Ellie Goulding's vocals accelerate the intimacy very well. I would rather listen to it a hundred times on a loop than watch the two or three inevitable sequels, depending on whether they split the last book in half.<br/><br/>One more element that must be considered before I go on an endless rant is Dakota Johnson who plays Anastasia Steele sounding awfully like a female porn star. She gets the chance to interview renounced Billionaire Christian Grey and they build a rapport to say the least. Johnson really should not be here leaving a giant mess of a film making a bad impact on her limited filmography. If this is the one that she expected to launch her into the atmosphere then God help her. She does the best with what she is given bless her. Mainly biting her lip and trembling with anticipation to be punished by Mr. Grey played by Jamie Dornan who has no idea what he is doing in any scene that he is in, it begs the question; does he even know how to have sex? Dornan is just plain and simply bland and bad, he delivers his lines with the dramatic resonance of a new comer to a soap opera. Almost winking at the camera like a reality TV star from Geordie Shore. At least he has the looks because otherwise he would have nothing going for him, this level of acting I expect to find in a low budget pornographic film, not a Hollywood Blockbuster or is that Block Basher?<br/><br/>Which unfortunately brings me to the script. I do not think there has been one this awful and misguided since 'Twilight', 'The Last Airbender' and 'After Earth'. It is the work of four amateurs (or at least it feels that way) and it sticks out like a sore thumb. How four people mashed together this terrible script is beyond any comprehension because it stinks. I have seen better work by one person, Aaron Sorkin, he seems to be one of the few script writers that actually possesses a working brain. The lines do induce laughs, but unintentional ones. You never feel that Grey and Steele are connected emotionally; they are only together because the script is insistent that they are. I fail to see what Anastasia gets out of their sexual encounters apart from losing her cherry. Mr Grey spanks her butt and that is all there is to it. No chemistry whatsoever. Dornan is like a plank of wood, but Johnson reaches to inject her character with some well needed development and tries to make sparks fly, they are just nowhere to be seen. If this is true love, then I think I have more sexual tension with my Blu- ray Surround Sound System.<br/><br/>It is far too long and padded to the limit; and I thought 'The Hobbit' and 'The Hunger Games Mockingjay' where stretched to the max, within an inch of their lives. We have to sit through endless talking about mundane topics, which will seem sexual to a male audience under the age of twelve and a female audience under the age of sixteen. In the UK, 'Fifty Shades of Sh*te' is an 18, so they are unable to view it. The only audience members it therefore has are forty-year-old women who have tragic sex lives and unwilling couples who are fooled into watching it because it is released on Valentine's Day.<br/><br/>Yes, there are sex scenes and we see Johnson's boobs and butt. However, this does not mean it is worth the ticket price; I do not care how amazing they both are! Dornan simply stares at her like the male equivalent of Bella and there we have it Twilight with rough sex! Which includes BDSM, but the writers seem to have glanced at what a Wikipedia page can tell you! There is no understanding prevalent in the film and Steele seems to be uncomfortable as her bum is slapped about. Just a hint, now might be the time to use your safe word.<br/><br/>I can go on for no longer and cannot review what is the worst excuse for a film and not only the worst film of 2015, but also the worst film ever made. 'Batman and Robin' you have been robbed of your kingly crown. Don't take your loved one to see it. You may lose them forever. Just have a romantic night in with any of the following films, 'Titanic', 'Annie Hall', 'Beauty and the Beast', '(500) Days of Summer' or 'Her'. Save yourself from this colossal cum stain of a film."
"limka81","5","5","15","13 February 2015"," Something's missing..may contain spoilers (first movie review)
","OK, I read the book first. I am in my early 30s and it's a first sex book since high school ))) The movie felt like a bunch of shortened scenes clumped together.. Without reading the book you probably won't understand the movie at all. I'm not a complete thrilled fan of the books either because of cheesy moments or plain ""come on, that doesn't happen in real life"" stuff. But what made me read through the whole book were the sex descriptive scenes... The movie falls short on those.. it felt like that the director just flies through those and doesn't give the viewer enough time to even try to enjoy them..<br/><br/>The Actors. Ana is not how I would picture her. Here is an erotic movie with lots of naked scenes and you want to see beautiful bodies of lovers...but as soon she gets naked, it's disappointing: freckled face, regular body, flat chested.. even women like to look at beautiful naked women ! ))) It's not the case in this movie.. Christian always has a slight smile on his face. For some reason he never looked serious to me during the whole movie. I didn't catch the ""tortured look"" that he was going for. His body passed the nakedness test :) <br/><br/>You have to always keep in mind that this book was written as many of those ""chick soft porn"" books, the author herself didn't expect it to become so widely popular. That's why it has a standard ""rich guy falls in love with an ordinary girl"" story. To me, it's the unusual BDSM sex ideas and ""pleasing her first or no matter what"" that attract women's attention. Also, the fun emailing back and forth in the book makes the reader want to read further. In the movie it was barely shown...<br/><br/>Bottom line, I want to see the movie again, to enjoy it in a more private setting than in a theater. And I hope the creators of this movie will read the negative comments and make the sequels better )))<br/><br/>p.s. What's with constant comparing to Twilight series ? I don't get it.."

"hugorocksmy","6","5","15","13 February 2015"," Entertaining but NOT...
","5.3/10 Fifty Shades of Grey might not be as bad as people wanted it to be, or at least thought it would be. But it sure conveys a pretty bad message and overall feeling. Yes, it might be sexy at times but it was never arousing nor appealing. But instead it gives you this sense of worry for Anastasia-played very well by Dakota Johnson-because she clearly has no identity or self respect, and so it can be somewhat dark and disturbing. Meanwhile, Christian-portrayed blandly by Jamie Dornan-is clearly a control freak that wants to use and control her but it is all extremely sugar coated, that it might even seem as true romance, but it is not for the most part. However, the movie was indeed very well directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson based on its material, and it's cinematography looked very nice as well. Also, the soundtrack of the movie was fairly good, but sometimes too distracting when played in the more erotic scenes. That said, the movie is not as graphic as you might think in my opinion, but still it has its moments of roughness. Moreover, as I mentioned before, the performances were partially good, mainly from Dakota Johnson who gives this awkwardness and lightness to her character in a very dark movie, but it is Jaime Dornan that clearly misses the mark and comes out as more secondary and kind of empty, only depending on his looks and attractiveness. Overall, this is surely one of those movies that people will love to hate, or at least that's how I feel, even though I'm still undecided what to really think, because it has much more than just this masochistic relationship, it's not as simple as black or white, and so that's what really challenges me to really analyze it and see what it is trying to say. Thus, it was entertaining but not quite as shocking, and it might not be the healthiest romance on film but still it has a big impact on today's society and culture, so hopefully it won't influence as much. But still, it is something ""fun"" and out of the ordinary to experience at the movie theater by yourself, and decide if you like it or not.<br/><br/>~February 12, 2015~"

","I went into this movie not expecting it to be an Oscar nominated film, but I did go to enjoy the film and that I did. I believe that way too many people had too high of expectations for the film. This film is far from pornography and those who have actually watched some would realize that, too.<br/><br/>The actors played their parts wonderfully. Dakota did great as Ana...she was innocent and inexperienced just as Ana was in the books and even so, she stood her ground, as seen in the scene in the meeting room. Jamie played a tortured soul just as Christian was in the books. Too many of the women(and some men) went into this movie expecting it to be a flop because the actors they wanted to play the parts weren't picked and that's just childish.<br/><br/>I thought that the sex scenes were tastefully done, even the last scene. They portrayed the belt scene as it was in the books. It wasn't meant to be light-hearted and fun because that was the main turning point in the first book.<br/><br/>Those who didn't read the book didn't enjoy the ending because they just don't understand. It's supposed to leave us hanging until the next movie comes out, just like the first book left us wanting more for the next book.<br/><br/>The one thing that has frustrated me most in reading posts about the movie are that some people think that their relationship is abusive. It is anything but. Anything that happened between the two characters is completely sensual, even if it is rough.<br/><br/>The point of the whole series is that Ana slowly knocks down the wall that Christian has built and challenges his ways. He realizes that even after his horrible experiences that he can love and be loved in return.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see the next installment!"

Maybe it's because I'm not 21 anymore, maybe 4 years gap made me realize what a pathetic story this is or maybe the producers didn't do a good job with adaptation.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie made me cringe for the first half and bored out of my mind for the second half.<br/><br/>I went last night expecting to see hot, intense and interesting male protagonist and dull, boring and annoying female lead. But I got exactly opposite. Jamie Dornan was horrible choice for C.G., he didn't portray strength and sexiness, he more looked like he was constipating and he delivered his lines without a bit of charm. Extremely bland actor. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is Dakota Johnson. She did her absolutely best with what she got, she even made Ana look not like a complete fool (which I thought would be impossible).<br/><br/>I get why this move was such a hit (books were a huge hit, it was very well marketed etc.) but I think that people who go to see the next one should be automatically refereed to their doctor for hearing, eye and mental check."

We were all disappointed in the actor playing Christian's brother, Elliot. He just isn't what we imagined him to be.

","Well, I must say, as far as this movie is concerned although it's based on a poorly written book, it is still much better than the crap of a book.<br/><br/>Based on the acting, the main cast could have done much better than they did. Expected a lot from Jamie Dornan. There are so many actors out there that would have done a much better job than he did. Johnson actually fit perfectly the description that conforms with Ms Steele in the book. Although her acting was here and there she actually in my opinion helped the movie a little. But they both really need to work on their chemistry and not make it look like they are forced to do things and they should try and make their acting believable.<br/><br/>But then with the acting and the putting together of all the cast and crews it falls short of my expectation of the movie. Really expected so much from the movie even if the book was shitty i must say.<br/><br/>The other remaining cast well didn't do much to help the movie just made the movie more and more unbearable to watch but still in my opinion it's better to watch the movie than read the appalling book written by a horrible writer.<br/><br/>But i have a strong positive in this movie and that goes to the soundtracks of the movie. They did do a good job in the use of and putting together of soundtracks for the movie and the use of them at appropriate timing. This is really why i think the movie deserves a 4.<br/><br/>A better work can still be done for the remaining sequel if there would be one.

","Like at least half of the couples from the entire planet, I and my boyfriend went to watch the contradictory ""Fifty shades of Grey"".I decided to go there with an open mind as I had read both positive and negative reviews. I didn't have great expectations and I used to joke by saying to people that I was just curious how it feels to watch porn in a full cinema hall. The truth is I really wanted to see if the book and film do have substance or an underlying message, a sort of philosophy or at least a coherent story. It all started nice, very usual, with the two meeting, the flickers in the protagonists' eyes, Anastasia's shyness and Grey's boldness. The first part was entertaining - if we try to leave aside the boring clich√©s- because of some cute and funny moments that got people giggling.But as the film advanced, the cute funny moments vanished and the clich√©s started to pile up to build a weird and sick story that can hardly be called a story. <br/><br/>Mr Grey, one of the most wanted men on the planet, falls in love with the cute little student, Anastasia, who is, accidentally, a virgin. Seriously? Of course it was that kind of romantic ""love at first sight"", and Anastasia couldn't stop thinking about him and he always shows up when she's least expecting it. Oh, come on! <br/><br/>These people really got on my nerves. It's clear that Grey wants the girl because she's the ""rare bird"" and he's used to get everything he wants. All he does throughout the film is psychologically pressing Anastasia to surrender to his will and so be his sexual slave. And there's also Anastasia who knows that if she doesn't agree to ""play"" with him, they won't ever see each other. So, we have a guy who is sentimentally blackmailing a girl to be able to put into practice his sick sexual perversities.<br/><br/>I really regret having watched this on ""Valentine's Day"". I've searched for love in here. I have. And I have only found a maimed specimen of it. But thinking better about it, I realize that maybe this is what ""love"" means in this century: sex&money&perversities.<br/><br/>There were also a lot of scenes that I've found creepily hilarious such as the one in which Anastasia is spanked by Grey. Also, the explanation of Grey's behaviour - that is his tormented childhood and adolescence- felt very unnatural, very clich√©d. He struggles to look charming and mysterious but I don't buy it! I don't believe him! And he didn't make me care about him. <br/><br/>I went to watch this because I was curious. I don't regret doing it (except that, as I said before, it had to happen on Valentine's day). Anyway, while I heard some people went out of the cinema hall ready to spicy up their intimate lives, I felt the opposite effect on me: disgust for sex ( when is implies disrespect and blackmail)."

Now on to the movie, the pacing was very slow and the ""storyline"" was quite boring. I had to fast-forward the last 30 minutes of the movie because I was waiting for something interesting to happen. Maybe a shocking ending. In reality, what I saw was about 20 minutes of ""romance"" that could pass for pornography.

"DavidLindahl","3","2","4","7 April 2016"," A poor sexual movie from a mediocre novel
","Earlier this week it was finally time to watch the much talked about film, Fifty Shades of Grey, based on the book by the same name. For those of you who are not familiar with the story, it is about young Anastasia Steele who gets the opportunity to interview the billionaire Christian Grey. Their meeting creates heavy sparks between them and they later meet again and start to develop feelings for each other. But, Christian Grey is not like ordinary people. He has a very special taste when it comes to sexual activities, which Anastasia will soon discover.<br/><br/>This film has been such a big topic for the last year and it has practically been impossible to avoid hearing about it. For instance, the director Sam Taylor-Johnson will not return to direct the sequels because apparently she constantly fought on set with writer E. L James about the dialogue and details from the script. In the leading roles we see Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey.<br/><br/>Before I start to talk about the film I will say that I actually started reading the book, but I did not finish it. My first reaction now after I've seen Fifty Shades of Grey, is that it could have been made better. I feel that the film didn't go in the direction I think it was intended to. To my understanding, Fifty Shades of Grey is supposed to be about feminism and encouragement for women to also be able to explore their sexuality. I am uncertain if this message really did go through to the audience. In the film Anastasia seems to be eager to please others but rarely appears to do anything for herself. Perhaps this is the point of the film, but I feel that it could have been made differently to create a greater impact.<br/><br/>This leads me directly to the second big problem of the film, the characters. There is no doubt that Christian Grey has a permanent scar from his teenage years, which makes him unable to love anyone else. Jamie Dornan actually makes him pretty insecure and we clearly feel that there's something else behind his hard shell. Perhaps this is the reason why some people have criticized his performance, because they feel that Christian should be more self-confident and macho. I however liked it and thought it made him more human. Dakota Johnson's take on the character Anastasia is harder for me to get. I feel like I never really understand why she falls for Christian in the first place, or whatever motivates her at all.<br/><br/>There was of course a few things I did like about Fifty Shades of Grey. The music was almost always very fitting, except for Danny Elfman's film score, which at times felt a bit repetitive. Beside the music, I did like Seattle as a background and a lot of the production design was very well made, especially Christian's apartment. To summarize, I really don't know how I feel about the film. It does feel like it is too faithful to the book, despite the fact that the script excludes some plot lines. Perhaps it was E. L James constant interfering at the set that prevented director Sam Taylor-Johnson from having more creative freedom. I guess in the end I would have rather seen more character development than helicopter and glider flights, even if they did look good.<br/><br/>David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"
"tylerchrestman","6","2","4","15 February 2016"," A Missed Opportunity
","I read the book and was interested to see how they would adapt it into a film that was both true to the book and would appeal to the mass market. The filmmakers may have been attempting to do both, but in trying to please everyone they seem to have fallen short on all accounts.<br/><br/>Noticeable right from the opening scene is the fact that Christian Grey is shown with his shirt off, something that does not happen in the book. He does not remove his shirt. It's actually a plot device almost totally ignored in the movie, though not that large of a deal this appears to set the tone for the movie being at odds with the book. <br/><br/>The casting choice in this movie was the most talked about thing in Hollywood and I can't help but feel as though for all the hype they did a terrible job. Dornan does a decent job inhabiting the character, but his voice doesn't. He doesn't appear to possess the magnetism that Grey is supposed to. Dakota Johnson is just terrible. There is nothing much I can say positive for her performance. The worst part about their sharing a screen is the fact that the chemistry doesn't feel real. The whole thing feels forced and rushed. So much emphasis is placed on innuendo it can hardly be called subtle. <br/><br/>The soundtrack feels like a parade of high up celebrities and though it has some excellent songs feels distracting. More orchestra to emphasize what's happening on scene and less radio pop.<br/><br/>As for one of the more talked about parts. The want to receive an R rating and therefore be able to market to a broader audience is understandable however the sex scene were tepid at best. A poor display of any BDSM knowledge. (The first book does not dive into anything too deep BDSM related, but the movie does a poor job displaying even the light work) and lastly the Hollywood double standard of nudity is ever present. Dakota spends a fair amount of screen time fully nude and yet no full frontal from the main male cast. Now contracts aside for the movie and the subject matter it seems a bit shy.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't deserve a 1,2, or 3 star. Those people are just judging because they don't like the trendiness of the material. This is a missed opportunity however because the material was there to make a great movie and instead they missed the mark."

","Fifty Shades of Grey was always going to be terrible. Unsurprisingly, it is terrible, yet it could have been worse. In contrast to Bella Swan (FSOG originated as Twilight fan fiction), the heroine may not be a brilliantly written character but Dakota Johnson does an unexpectedly good job. Sam Taylor-Johnson directs the movie well and the cinematography has a certain style to it. The soundtrack isn't the worst either. But don't think for a moment I'm defending this. It's not the utter, complete, irredeemable failure it may have been, but it's still a failure. Slow, airless, boring, plot free and devoid of any compelling narrative arc, it's difficult to see a point to this movie. The sex scenes, surely? Well, they don't take up that much of the film and much of it is... nothing really. There's no chemistry between the lead actors and Jamie Dornan gives a wooden, charisma free performance. Plus, it's in many ways a fairly tasteless and sexist film with many highly uncomfortable moments.<br/><br/>So, the question still remains. What is this? Is it a porn movie? Well, no since the sex scenes don't take up that much of the film and they're not as strong as many were evidently hoping. Is it a character study? Well, some more character depth would have been appreciated. Despite the occasional interesting lines, mostly the characters are two dimensional so no. Is it a romantic drama? It's about as romantic as a torture porn horror film due to its lack of passion and emotion so definitely not. Is it an erotic thriller? Well, if you want thrills you won't get a single one, while it's really not that erotic, so again no. It doesn't even have a proper ending. It doesn't feel complete, it's outrageously, obscenely overlong at 2 hours and in general it's just a total bore. That's what FSOG is. A bore. Now we have 2 sequels to look forward to despite the fact that if you reduced the movie to its amount of actual story it'd be 15 minutes long. Overall, a dud although at least it's not as bad as Terminator Genesys.<br/><br/>4/10"

","I knew it! I knew, as I started enjoying the film, that by the end I was going to be disappointed and in this regard my notion was fulfilled. The movie starts out really strong. In fact, it really turned me on at first and coming from a dedicated gay man I think that's a pretty big compliment. The acting, in fact, is great. The problem lies with the subject matter. As this world is one that I know a little something about, I understand the complexities involved in these relationships and knew that, ultimately, it was going to end with their breaking up. There were moments along the way that excited me, I confess. Christian's courting of Anna is exciting. His deflowering of her once he finds out she's a virgin is exciting. Her initial entry into his sexual world is exciting. He shows her tenderness and seems earnestly desirous of having a relationship with her. The problem, of course, is that they have different needs. It's unacceptable to judge one versus the other as ""right and wrong"". If nothing else he's fully up front with her about his desires. Problem is that she has no real inclination to explore them except for the fact that she's falling in love with him and does so to get to know him which is counter intuitive to what he's looking for. The more you hold him the less you can have him. She's young and inexperienced and the more she gets to know him the more of him she wants but she wants him HER way and not the way he's able to give her. So ultimately the movie is a downer but there are good moments along the way. Considering it's a mainstream movie they do a decent job but really how can this sort of subject matter be expected to translate to a mainstream Hollywood film? That's really the problem with the film version - they're constrained by their R rating. Anyway, I'm glad I actually watched it, it wasn't a waste of time but it did leave me frustrated by the ending."

","Finally, I saw this movie last night. I've read so many dreadful reviews that I was prepared for the worst. For starters, I have not read the book so I'm oblivious to the source material, but since so many reviewers regard it as trash also, I really didn't bother reading it.<br/><br/>Fifty Shades Of Grade had many problems when it hit theaters. Its main problem was the over-hype, and it goes both ways: people hating it, and people (ladies in particular) loving it, or at least, being less harsher with their appraisal of the movie.<br/><br/>It all boils down to this: it's a dark, romantic drama. Had it been named something else, like ""The Rich Psycho"" or ""Charming Sadomasochist"" perhaps it would have fared better with reviewers, because I understand it was a big box office hit.<br/><br/>It's the story of Anasthasia Steele, a student in her final year in College, living with a friend, Kate, and both studying something related to journalism and English literature. Kate has an appointment to interview Christian Grey, the local millionaire impresario, who also happens to be a young, handsome looking bachelor. When Kate can'y make it to the interview, she sends her roommate Anasthasia to do the job. Knowing very little about Mr. Grey, Anasthasia agrees to interview him, but has virtually no interviewing skills (she even forgets to bring a pen or pencil to write down things). When Anasthasia and Christian Grey meet something happens to both of them: they like each other. Ana, as she prefers to be called, is shy, good looking and in her very early twenties. Christian must be at least 8 to 10 years older (mid thirties probably), with an athletic built and a bit of an expressionless face (he rarely smiles. Ana is obviously smitten by Mr. Grey, as usually rich and powerful people don't always translate into handsome. But unlike other women, she seems genuinely interested in him, and not his wealth, and I think this point was pulled out rather well in the film. It's easy to write off Ana as a ""money hungry"" woman, but the meeting of the two is well played out. Christian as well feels something odd about Ana: he obviously is also smitten by her, unlike all the women he's met or had before, and a guy of his wealth could have virtually anyone and anything. Ultimately the two admit that they like each other a lot, but there's one problem: Grey's past, which we learn in little bits throughout the film but we don't get to know the guy well enough, just like Ana. It seems Mr.Grey is fond of some sadomasochistic kinkiness and Ana is his new prey, but one she cares for a lot to be just ""another one"". Grey's character (portrayed by Jamie Dornan) was often criticized for being dull, but I think that's exactly what his portrayal wanted to be. We have a man who is haunted by a less than pleasant past and sees in Ana as a way to escape from that past, yet he finds it hard to let go of a lifestyle he has completely submerged in.<br/><br/>Reviewers find it hard to believe a woman willing to be hit with whips, tied to a bed with ropes and such, yet women like these actually exist: in households with husbands that hit and mistreat them. A lot of them endure the pain because they have nowhere else to go but others, and they might be a minority, endure it because they truly love their partners in spite of them, and still have hopes that someday they might change. One of those believers in Ana, who herself becomes obsessed with Christian Grey as to why he won't have a ""normal"" relationship. As to why he won't ""sleep"" with her like a normal couple. As to why he has to make a contract for their relationship. Ana falls madly in love with Grey, and Grey is obviously madly in love with her, but he can't let go of that past that still haunts him. All the power and money he has achieved at his young age can't compensate for the turmoil in his head. He is in dire need of psychiatric help. So in real life, stuff like this DOES happen, and it goes both ways: women with hidden traumas and guys with unresolved childhood issues. It just happens that, for Hollywood's sake, the psycho here happens to be a well looking millionaire.<br/><br/>There are bits and pieces here and there that might look illogical. When Ana found out Christian was into kinky, sadomasochistic stuff, why didn't she go away? Again, she fell deeply in love with this guy.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely not the worst movie ever. All those reviewers really need to see some BAD movies. Was it an over-hyped movie? I'll hand that to you. Was it the best? Certainly not. Was it overtly sex filled? Basic Instict was far more explicit. Is it OK to watch it with your girlfriend or spouse on a rainy Friday afternoon? You bet!"

Neither one of us wrote a review EVER. Not until now, at least. If you are reading this, please take my advice and give up on the idea of watching this piece of garbage, unless you really absolutely have a miserable life and hate yourself with passion. One of my girlfriends read a book and was fascinated by it. When I asked her what was it about she told me ""it had to do with one girl's exploration of her body and sexual limits"", I instantly knew it was most likely some kind of ""soft porn"" (my husband's words) and gave up on the idea of even asking details let alone reading the book. I am English lit graduate, so I refuse to read just anything. Anyway, I happened to have a really rough past couple of weeks (tons of work and homework) and needed something to relax a bit, and I find this so excellently advertised movie and decide to watch it while dog-sitting my friend's puppy. I wish I'd never done it. I am not, unfortunately, one of those people who just turn to different channel when they don't like something, I just get it over with no matter how painful it is. This way none of my sexually neglected (by their husbands) friends will have enough arguments to convince me it's a good movie/show. So I watch it and I cuss and I swear and hate myself for ever starting to watch this. One word: CHEAP! From acting, actors, theme, conversations etc. CHEAP!

The type of women who normally devour hello magazine, and felt a need to upgrade to fifty shades of Grey to fantasize about a similar experience with a billionaire. <br/><br/>But in the movie, there's no room for fantasy as you are shown images and you have to go with the acting. Your mind doesn't take you further than the screen. So if you stick to it, what is left is very very little. While the girl (Anastasia) shows some decent acting skills and she might need another movie to prove her worth, the guy (Christian Grey) was mediocre at best. He doesn't make you believe about the character for a second. I doubt he'll have a successful career if he is not saved by his looks. <br/><br/>The only thing that could have saved the movie was if they had wished to create some suspense around the character and the origins of his mentally disturbed personality. Sadly, the person who adapted the script thought this was an unimportant piece of information for the viewer, so when the girl asks to know more about Christian Grey's past, what you get is a simple: ""I can't tell you or you would hate me"".

James' of the same title.<br/><br/>Well,a lot of critics and most of the movie going public particularly IMDb commenters have trashed the film.There are plenty of reasons to do so.It starts with what it wants to be all about:sadomasochistic sex.Too bad that the sex scenes are far from being realistic and one could find that the actors participating in it feel a lot of discomfort while doing it and their reactions look unnatural and unreal.Then,the story was lacking as we don't get to know much about Christian and Ana.<br/><br/>Also,they aren't compelling and interesting enough for the viewers to care about them.They also lack depth despite of the lunacy of the characterizations the movie wants them to portray.<br/><br/>In addition to that,story has become somewhat simplistic in the sense that the both Christian and Ana have entered their weird relationship without logical reasons except for the needs of the story with a sequel baiting conclusion that will leave everyone hanging and wondering as to what ultimately happened to both in the end.<br/><br/>Nevertheless,I gave this movie the guts to adapt the novel into the big screen knowing the expectations that will be laid upon by the public on the producers.Too bad that it did not translate very well in the big screen as it was done poorly and everything ended up funny and laughable without the intention of doing so."
"Joel-942-144075","6","2","4","25 June 2015"," The rating & topic turned me off, but surprisingly the movie wasn't bad
","I saw the uncut version - maybe I don't know enough about this activity, but I found the topic gently approached. The sex scenes I felt were appropriate, not shied away from, yet not over done.<br/><br/>Beyond that is the story content. This could have easily been a story of any 'Beauty and the Beast' scenario - the gentle girl trying to get through the savage beasts rough exterior. <br/><br/>If you want to see another-shade-of-grey, see the movie 'Secretary' (2002) staring James Spader as Mr. Grey. At last check, that movie was rated 7.1 and was much more over the top. (BTW: The 'Fifty Shades of Grey' books came out in 2011 - a possible rip-off of 'Secretary'). <br/><br/>I wonder if the bad rating for this movie was due to mixed expectations. For me; the ratings, the topic, and the social commentary all over the net, kept me away for a long time. When I finally did watch it though, I couldn't believe how mild it was, and how it was a rather okay production.<br/><br/>If 'Secretary' gets a 7.1, then this certainly deserves a 6.0."

"KineticSeoul","1","2","4","22 May 2015"," Worse than ""Twilight""
","Wow, this movie is just terrible and when I say terrible it has got to be one of the worst romance movies I have seen. It's even worse than ""Twilight"" which is actually saying something. Nothing about this movie makes any sense. Sure, when it comes to attraction, logic can go out the window. But nothing about this movie makes any sense. The chemistry just flat out suck and there wasn't a single remotely significant thing that stood out for any of the characters. Especially the female lead who was bland as bland can get. Naive maybe, but so uber bland. Maybe this is to attract most average female movie goers, but it's just so freaking bland. I know this was written by someone who is a fan of ""Twilight"". So the writing literally seems like someone below the age of 16 who is a fangirl that is into writing random scenarios of anime/manga/actors/singers would write upt. Except this movie goes in a serious direction and it falters in almost everyway possible. The start seemed like it would be something at least watchable, but it's far from it. After 15 minutes in, I was like ""when is this freaking movie going to end!"".<br/><br/>1/10"
"hallmarc20","7","2","4","18 May 2015"," I don't understand why everyone hates this movie... (spoiler safe)
","I personally do not like romantic movies but this was unlike anything I have ever seen. I was honestly entertained by this movie and appreciate the originality of it. Because of this movie I am going to purchase the book trilogy and read them. I think the reason a lot of people are hating on this movie is because they have read the books and have such high expectations. Movies are never as good as the books, fact. Since I have not yet read them, I have to say it was very unique and enjoyable. It's a shame that this movie isn't getting the credit it deserves. I didn't notice bad acting like what I have read in other reviews. Perhaps Ana could have had more emotion but since I haven't read the books I have no idea if that is her character. Christian did a great job at playing his role. He is probably every woman's dream guy, minus the intimacy issues. I hope they continue the trilogy along with the books."
"blupu","8","2","4","17 May 2015"," Another view on FSoG
","I've heard a lot about Fifty Shades of Grey. I have heard it was about sexual abuse, or that it was just straight up porn. That made me afraid of watching this movie. But I decided to just go for it.<br/><br/>And I want everyone who has an opinion on this movie (Good or bad) and hasn't seen it to watch it now. When I watched this movie, I saw what the people meant, about the porn. But those people just see one side of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is about a relationship between two people, from two different perspectives. It's about struggling with yourself. Not knowing who and what you are. It's about being open to things, but standing your point.<br/><br/>It's so much more that just porn. I respect everyone's opinion, and this is mine.<br/><br/>(ps. I'm just 14 so take it easy)"
"ericschneider-42656","3","2","4","17 May 2015"," Fifty Shades of Disappointment
","I can say very proudly that I never read the Fifty Shades of Grey book. After seeing this movie, I have to say that skipping the books was the best decision I ever made. Within the first few minutes of the flick, the entirety of what to expect is laid out right before the viewers' eyes. As soon as you see Anastasia disappear behind an elevator door with the word ""Christian"" on her lips, I suggest you get out. By this point, the extremely awkward and lackluster acting, as well as the poorly written and cheese infested script are very evident. Don't expect these to go away either, they remain throughout the entirety of the film. Also (spoiler alert), if you expect any chemistry to develop between the characters, turn back now. This is hardly a romance movie, and both of the main characters are stale. The movie essentially leaves you exactly where you left off: the main characters do not have a relationship and neither character has evolved. The complete lack of plot resolution leads me to a couple of possible conclusions: a) the makers of this film hate everyone and want to punish them (much like Christian Grey), or b) there is a sequel in the works. My guess is b, though I hope that sequel never sees the light of day. Either way, two hours of my life are down the drain and I can now say that movie quality has reached an all time low."
"CultInferno","2","2","4","15 May 2015"," 50 Dull Shades of Grey
","Okay, lets make this simple. After all the hype about the books, I was curious to see what many had come to love about the series. Now i have never read the book, but this movie was just plain awful. Without spoiling any of the ""story"" let me just say this. The acting was a shameful experience. Both characters where very unlikeable. I think what to blame is that there was NO character development. Basically giving you 2 characters and throwing them into a dull plot. The 2 characters are supposed to be adults. Yet this plays out like a teeny- bopper film. What I think really killed the movie was the very very very poorly written script. Awful dialog. Very dull, uninteresting, and unoriginal. Now i am somebody that loves movies and tries to find the artistic and special parts that make all movies enjoyable. But I am sorry Fifty Shades, even with an open mind to movies and film like mine, I just couldn't find anything good about this film. Its a real shame. I had thought with the success and popularity over the novel, that the writers would put a little more effort and time into making this movie watchable, but despite all that this was a flop. If the sequels are like this, why not go straight to DVD?"
"mace-91258","6","2","4","30 April 2015"," Not that bad
","First I'd like to say that a review should stay objective, how can you be objective when you give 1 or 10 stars to this kind of movie? Even if you hated it, you have to admit that the soundtrack is quite good and that the director did a decent job. I also understand that you can love this movie but you can't say that Dackota Johnson and Jamie Dorman deserve an Oscar for their performances. I am a male and I wasn't expecting much of this adaptation but surprisingly I enjoyed it. This movie is not a sexist soft-porn. It's just another love story. Christian is not too handsome and has a strong voice witch gives him the credibility needed. Ana has the kind of natural beauty that gives her the innocence needed. The director managed to make you feel their complicated personality without to much psychological details. I was a bit disappointed by the sex scenes that could have felt more intense. I'll have to wait for the next one to talk about the plot,I hope it gets a bit better. This movie made me curious, I wan't to know how this is gonna end."
"hannalitantra","5","2","4","7 April 2015"," Disappointing
","First of all, I don't hate the book. In fact, I enjoyed reading it even though sometimes it can be boring, I know, but the movie is just dull on the whole.<br/><br/>A lot of important things are thrown out from the movie; the important things that make the story interesting. That's why I'm so disappointed!<br/><br/>No offense, but in my opinion, Jamie is not exactly the Christian Grey I imagine. I just didn't feel the charisma of Christian that I felt when I read the book. In the movie, Christian's expression is just flat, not like in the book where he can be so intense all of a sudden.<br/><br/>As for Dakota, oh well, she's pretty decent for Ana.<br/><br/>My expectation for this movie was too high, now I wish I have never seen the movie. I should have just let the story played in my mind. Now, the image of Christian Grey is ruined."
"rubymccauley","7","2","4","8 March 2015"," Trying to review objectively...it's a long one!
","OK, so I will start by saying I HATED the books - the plot was threadbare, the writing simply atrocious...the list goes on. However, one thing I did say was that, if handled properly, it could translate better into film. Obviously the subject matter is a very adult love story, so I was nervous to see how they played it out, but here's what I thought. (I've ticked spoiler because I know some people haven't read the books and/or seen the film, so better safe than sorry)<br/><br/>Firstly, I had the soundtrack on pre-order, purely and simply because I liked what I heard. I could get a feel for how certain songs or moments would look on screen and even correctly guessed that Salted Wound was going to be used for their first proper sex scene. I liked that it was understated for the most part - the only scene I didn't like it was the Helicopter scene with the Ellie Goulding lyrics that changed for the release I have on itunes. It seemed a little overpowering.<br/><br/>When it comes down to the cast, I was pleasantly surprised by Dakota as Anastasia. Ana is a character I half wanted to slap for most of the books, and Dakota brought her to life pretty well because the feeling was still there (although a lot of the more irritating scenes in the novel were cut from the film, and I was less annoyed at the film because - thank god - no mention of the inner goddess!). I knew Jamie would be a good fit for Christian purely off his previous work and the trailers released before the film. He isn't physically what i'd go for (I prefer taller and stockier, so Jamie's head on Charlie Hunnam's body would have been perfect for me) but he acts the part well. My only criticism is that his accent does waver a little bit in certain scenes. With that being said, it didn't totally ruin the film for me.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, I feel, got the roughest end of the stick when it came to cuts - very little elaboration on Kate and Elliot, Mia, Mrs Robinson, Leila (no mention at all) etc. The way they plugged Rita Ora as Mia I was expecting much more than the fleeting screen time she got...but then again that FOUL wig would have got on my nerves. Definite ""Sack the stylist"" moment there and I hope it's improved upon if they go through with the sequels.<br/><br/>The dialogue is cringe-worthy in places and you can see that the author had a virtual stranglehold on the script. The hardware store scene when Christian shops for things (unbeknown to Ana) for his playroom could have used a total rewrite as i'm pretty sure nobody speaks like that in real life. I did like how they all but eradicated ""Laters, Baby"" and even mocked it slightly though in the scene where (SPOILER) Christian and Ana walk in on Kate and Elliot.<br/><br/>The film itself seemed very stylish and sleek to me - i'm no expert but the way it was directed worked well for me. I haven't seen Twilight but my friend I went with has, and she did make the comparison, but preferred 50 Shades. Probably because vampires are a bit more unrealistic than gazillionaire dominants, which leads me nicely to my next point...<br/><br/>The sex scenes. Those of you who wanted to see more - there's websites for that and I will happily point you in the right direction. Those of you who thought it was too much - what the hell did you expect?! I usually find sex scenes a bit awkward to watch in cinema, but not this. Obviously it helped that everyone knew to expect it (I hope), but I thought it was actually really well shot. Very tasteful, showing just the right amount. I'm glad they cut (spoiler?) the tampon scene though because that would have put me off my nachos.<br/><br/>When it comes to cut scenes, there were some I felt could have made it in somewhere - stuff like Ana getting a job. That said, I can see why they cut most of them out (especially the tampon scene!) and the film does flow well enough without them to justify it. The cuts do seem to expose the lack of storyline in parts, but let's be real here, it's still got more storyline than Magic Mike. The cuts also remove any doubt as to Ana's consenting to sexual activity, which I think had to be done otherwise there'd be outcry. I still see people criticising the scene in her apartment, but thinking about it logically (SPOILER), Elliot helped them move in, so all Christian had to do was ask him where the apartment was and get Kate to let him in. In fact, he probably already knew - remember the champagne and the helicopter balloon? Personally, I don't think it's too creepy.<br/><br/>To sum up - Yes, I would buy the DVD. Yes, I'd see the sequels. Yes, I was right when I said it would work better on film as I enjoyed the film a damn sight more than the books. Hopefully the sequel will lead on in the same vein but with a little bit of rewriting here and there to improve dialogue. The next two books delve a little deeper so it will be interesting to see how they're handled by the film."
"sukoshikibou","7","2","4","7 March 2015"," No one gets the point of a very good movie
","In my opinion most people don't get the point. *This is going to be a spoiler* The movie is not about BDSM at all. The movie wants to show that there is some kind of guys in this -crazy- world who enjoy a very different way of living life. <br/><br/>They are not interested in sex and they are not interested in a normal relationship. They are sadists. Sadists exist and there is no need to practice BDSM. He is doing BDSM just because it is a very graphical way to show in the duration of the film, that he enjoyed making people suffer. This time was her, but it could be someone else, another man as well. <br/><br/>This type of men exists and most people don't talk about it. I met myself one that is why I understood what was the meaning of the film. The film is between a girl that cannot even think about someone like that being a sadist. Usually the bad guy of the movie is an ugly guy, etc,.. but this time is a rich, good looking guy, very cold and smart, who is only interested in power. His world is alien to her, she cannot even think about someone like that. Her findings is that she finally acknowledge that there are people like that in this world, so she decides to run away because she quite scared of what she finally saw in him.. she discovered who he really was, and that is very scary. <br/><br/>Regarding another aspects of the movie, yes, it could have been done much better, that is why I give a 7, because I think the subject of the movie is very important but things could have been done much better. I am sure that there is more people (I hope) that got the meaning of the movie. The BDSM thing is not important at all, it is just a figurative way of saying what was his purpose when doing things in life: sadist. Regards, K."
"jmgan","6","2","4","7 March 2015"," Not Bad but......
","Haven't read the book but I wasn't expecting romance on this film, I thought the film is about senseless, erotic, sensual, perversion without guilt or just for fun or ""play acting"". The control or the dominant should have more background plot to the story to why he loves doing this perversion. I quite enjoyed the first half of the film, but doesn't like the ""bdsm"" scenes which doesn't look aggressive enough or believable. I see other user reviews that says its abusive to women or demeaning to society etc. I think going in they should've known what the movie is about so they shouldn't be surprise at the plot and say those things about demeaning to women and such..."

","I am a lover of the books.Not a super enthusiastic fan of them,but I have read them and I liked them.I was looking forward to seeing the movie.. Then it was released and the opinions I heard were pretty much all the same : ""It sucks""; ""It was not what I expected""; ""It's not worth watching it at all"".. So I decided to wait..I watched it last night and I have to say that I am pretty disappointed.It was only 3 minutes after the beginning of the movie..that I was shocked..This was not the right choice of actors..I mean this ""Cristian Grey"" that was described in the picture was dark,cold,hurt,sex- appealing,intimidating and the Cristian we got on the movie is always smiling and worm and his voice..The voice is just easy,fun,light,childish even;and his eyes..they were always warm and kind .. This is just something you can't miss,if you have read the books.. In the movie,everything was quick and messy..and the end of it was just stupid ... The ""Anastasia""role was really more good played ..But my overall opinion is that the movie was overrated and long-wanted,but the expectations were not justified.I think that the movie was failure and they should try really,really hard for the next one."
"fiftyshadescasting","5","2","4","24 February 2015"," There's a lot to like... A lot to dislike... Not the worst movie ever... Overall, very disappointed.
","I finally saw the movie on 02.20.15. I purposely chose NOT to relive the book before seeing the movie as that particular mishap led to my dissatisfaction with Twilight. I found that after rewatching Twilight I enjoyed it more than the first viewing, though still consider it the best book and worst movie with the Twilight Series.<br/><br/>So there we were. It was my wife and I. My wife read all 3 books multiple times and was LESS interested in seeing the movie than I was.<br/><br/>Now, I am a movie guy, movie buff, whatever you want to call it. I have nearly 500 DVD/BluRay movies that are all store bought. I grew up with a father who loved movies and we spent countless hours, together, watching movies... all kinds of movies. Drama, Horror, Comedy, Scifi, Classics, Low Budget Indies... all kinds of movies.<br/><br/>I was put off the moment the movie started because one of the first things you see... is Christian Grey. Not close up parts of the man, you see him. This put me off because as a movie fan and watcher of countless movies, I knew from a cinematic standpoint that an egregious error had been made to show him. More on that later...<br/><br/>So we finally get the main character, Ana. I was not a huge fan of Dakota Johnson's casting. Seeing the magazine photos, the trailers, nothing made me feel better about her as Ana. But I will tell you...<br/><br/>Over the course of the movie, I came to thoroughly enjoy her PERFORMANCE as Ana but still feel that she's not a great FIT as Ana.<br/><br/>So we're treated to the opening. So far it's pretty faithful to the book, I feel a little better. I know the interview is coming and know from reading the book how crucial a scene it is.<br/><br/>I was put off again because I felt that getting to the interview was rushed... In the book there's a gradual build up and as you read the words you totally understand that this young woman is getting into something so much bigger than she is and is about to jump in the deep end.<br/><br/>In the movie, you see Christian. You see Ana. You get a brief scene of Ana interacting with Kate. She's at the Grey House. She's in the interview. It was rushed.<br/><br/>Now, the interview is such a critical scene and I feel like they totally MISSED on the scene.<br/><br/>You get next to no impact of the big ""reveal"" of Christian from Ana's point of view. The entire start of the movie was a rush to get there and it felt like it was forced and rushed to get it done.<br/><br/>The ""reveal."" The book is told from Ana's POV. The first time she sees him, we see him. We see him through her eyes. Cinematically, we've already seen him. When she fell and he gave the god-awful look over the shoulder, the impact of that moment is lost. Let's go back in time...<br/><br/>Remember Twilight? In the book, Bella first sees him as he enters the lunchroom. They recreated that in the movie... and guess what, it worked! The first time the movie viewer sees Edward is the same time the main character sees him so you experience that impact together on the same level, cinematically.<br/><br/>I don't know why they chose to do it that way in FSOG but the interview stumbled from the start, just as Ana did going into the office.<br/><br/>So... by now you probably think I hate the movie and everything in it? No, actually.<br/><br/>There's A LOT to like in the movie, but it's counterbalanced by the bad stuff.<br/><br/>Please read the full review on my blog: http://50shadescastingblog.blogspot.com/"
"ilovecandies123","7","2","4","23 February 2015"," One word
","So, I'm just going to be honest. There is only one word that can describe this movie for me, quote ""for me"", Awkward<br/><br/>I have read the book since my friends told me it was awesome, exciting, etc --> typical women comments (just to let you know, I am a woman) <br/><br/>(Spoiler) <br/><br/>So I read the book, it wasn't exciting nor awesome nor whatever. If I had to summarize the book, I would say: ""An university graduate woman who was once so innocent ( aka virgin) who fell in ""love"" in a hot, controlling and ""tormented"" man. They go through the phases that all couples go through, well, not really, but you know it. They go through the up and downs, the rounds and rounds but honestly, they go through ""meet-talk-fuck-fuck-fuck-talk-blah-blah-blah"" The woman tries so hard to break his inner heart walls like a wrecking ball but of course, the guy steps back a few times that she misses the wall. The controlling and tormented man tries change himself and what you know, ding ding ding, the girl breaks the walls! She keeps on having sex with the ""changed"" man. They have children and they live duckily happily ever after."" <br/><br/>Of course most of you know that this isn't the overall truth but you get the picture. Book:<br/><br/>While reading the book, I had to remind myself that this isn't a true story, well not the relationship but I am sure this genre of sex do. I had to constantly remind myself that this is a basic book based on a woman desire that somehow originated from ""twilight"", ""secretary"" and a true story of a man that worked at the bank. The book could be enjoyed by women and men but only those that haven't had some sex for some time, all the organisms etc. I don't know if any of you have read the newspaper yet but there was recently some ""accidents"" stating that during the film, some woman and men were masturbating, so I'm sure there were some people who did while reading the book. Well, we have some prove that this is ""exciting"" but honestly, the book was badly written, could have been better if there was more taking, getting to know each other, and a little less sex. Hell, this was supposed to be a romantic book, not a badly written porn novella.<br/><br/>Movie:<br/><br/>As I stated above, it was AWKWARD. The book, I can read, use my imagination and change the book inside me mind and all, but the movie, oh god the movie. I am fine with all the nudity and sex but only if there is chemistry between the actors, only if there is this ""feeling"" aka realism. But no, there wasn't any of that, sadly. I was hoping that the movie would be better than the book. That there are some people that have the abilities to transform the book into something worth watching. I am not blaming the actors, the directors, the helpers. No one really. If I was in their situation, I would've ran before the filming even started. This was an Awkward situation. The male lead, um, what's his name? Oh yeah, Jamie Doran. I am not a person that knows the actors names, hell, I don't even know the authors of books that I love to read, I am more interested in the material. So. Jamie Doran, a normal British and if I may add, hot guy. That's a fact. He's hot and he behaves like a gentleman. (I hope so) I can imagine him trying to understand Christian Grey, his character, his ways of living and etc. even the sex. In all, he is ordinary and it's takes a lot of effort to understand Christian and the sex. From what I have seen in the movie, it takes a real dominant to really understand another dominant. To go from ""normal"" to dominant, I bet Jamie's head is a real mess because as we all know, sex is about pleasure, fun, not abuse. The female lead, Dakota Johnson, was in a somehow better situation. She just had to act as a normal girl with no sex experience that went through the process of understanding and submitting to Christian. So she just had to act as if it was herself that went through this but of course in a similar way to Anastasia. But she still had to go through a process where minds are bound to go in a mess. <br/><br/>As I have said, I am not blaming anybody for this movie. It was a best-seller book that was turned into a movie. All I can say is that they tried and it failed. It was a book that only a few people can understand it. <br/><br/>I rated this 7 out of 10 because they had to of this because there was a lot of people who wanted it and they had to fulfill their desires. They tried and they failed for a certain amount of people. For me, I always put 5 as awful, 6 -.-, 7 OK but not going to watch it again, 8 nice, 9 awesome, 10 so going to recommend this. <br/><br/>I can't put less than 5 stars because there will always exist some movies that sucks but I can't put any less the 5 stars because they tried. Of course some directors only do the movie to earn a pretty quarter but I am not going to say anything against that, it's as they say, ""money goes around the world""<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this movie but I'm sure that there will be a second one."
"zombienikki22","6","2","4","22 February 2015"," Meh..
","Okay, first off, I have not read the books. I went into to this movie just expecting the worst. Well, it wasn't that horrible. Now, don't get me wrong... it wasn't a GOOD movie but I feel like its getting a worse grade than it should. Lets cover a few things: 1.) The acting. It's very vanilla. The actors have a few moments of chemistry together, but I don't feel the actors represent who these characters are supposed to be. There are some cheesy moments and lines and you can't help but laugh. When I go see a movie, I feel like the actors should pull me in, make me feel what they are portraying and that didn't happen. Grade C- 2.) The storyline. So, since I didn't read the books, I was left with questions that were never answered. I feel like some of those should have been addressed. There is sort of a story here but because of the pace of the movie, the acting, and the general non-awareness of what the heck is going on, its kind of hard to follow with them. Grade C 3.) The sex. I didn't feel that the sexual scenes were that bad. I was expecting more and a tad better because of reputation. All in all, it didn't consist of the entire movie, but I feel it shows enough to convey what the story is telling. Grade B<br/><br/>So, I feel like I was entertained for 2 hours and thats what I pay for. I will probably see the others just to see if my questions are ever answered. But, will I watch this again, will I buy the movies or read the books? Probably not."

","He is a controlling, manipulative jerk and was not portrayed as sexy. All along, this was the story of a naive young lady who is blinded by the combination of money, outward physical attractiveness, and a misguided sense of what love is.
It starts as fun, like any romance with a manipulative jerk, and gradually reveals who he really is. We see signs that she is in over her head and wrestling with whether she can leave him.
In my opinion, it should have ended the way it did, with her knowing that she had to leave him, even though her feelings would never stop. Adding sequels belittles her empowering decision.
To anyone who has been in a toxic or abusive relationship, this movie can heal by showing how hard it can be to leave."

","I feel like the people who made this movie really missed out on making a great movie based off a book. I mean even the slightest detail of adding a narration of Anastasia's thoughts while things are happening (like they did in the book) would of made the movie a lot better. They just missed out on details and I am not sure why they felt the need to change some things... I almost wish they would of just made two movies just so they didn't feel the need to skip out on so much detail. And the guy had ""copper"" hair... wtf to why they changed that little detail lol.
It's a cute romance movie until you read the books and then you'll just be annoyed by the movie forever lol."

","Finally, being a straight male and therefore not in the market for the traditional girls night out, I watched this surreptitiously on TV a few days ago. I have not read any of the books so am judging the film purely on its own merits. OK, so yes it is far too long and the BDSM element is vastly over- hyped, being extremely tame by present-day standards. But for me it does have some erotic charge in the ""will they, won't they, what will they do?"" sort of way. And the two leads are undoubtedly attractive (Dakota Johnson in my case). Dakota is very well cast. What is curious about the whole thing is that it is really just an old- fashioned rich boy meets poor(ish) girl romance that could have been made 60 years ago. Perhaps that is what others mean when they say the script is clunky. So in all, not a triumph, but not a turkey either."

","I recorded the movie and finally watched it not really sure what it was going to be. After watching it I came here, IMDb, as I was curious to see how it was received. Well I only read 3 ""pages"" of reviews and realised it was not very well received at all, but was happy to see some comments that seemed very positive, and honest to me. I did not mind it at all, I though it was an interesting portrayal of an unusual situation between two people. I do believe they were very attracted to each others. Our man was powerful with unusual desires but he just found someone quite special who may have been innocent and naive as some perceived her, yet quite her own person, however ready to take chances and explore unknown territories. People who crucify this film should perhaps have another look at their idol actors and find out what some of them were up to - or may be it is only rumours! I do grant those who have had a very sheltered life that they may not see anything interesting or pleasurable about 50 s of g. But personally even though I had to research ""BDSM"" to understand it. I did not think this movie was a waste of my time or an abomination. Yet I felt the use of strong language in rare occasion was out of place and unnecessary here (Don't misunderstand me, there is not a single day I live without using strong language). I liked the look of both actors and did see some chemistry, a lot of chemistry between them....there must have been if there is a sequel! Sorry usually i omit the score bit!"

","This film was being advertised and raved about all over Brisbane a couple of years ago. It piqued my interest, and I just now got the opportunity to watch it. What a letdown. The actors have little on-screen chemistry; the scenes, although somewhat erotic at times, are pretty clich√©d; the storyline is predictable and the ending is unresolved. Even the support actors did little to raise the level of acting. Much better watching for suggestive eroticism is 9 1/2 Weeks with Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger, or if you want a silly but entertaining romantic romp, select a Hugh Grant movie, which at least will involve a reasonably high level of acting."
"swilliky","3","0","0","14 February 2017"," A terrible romance from an awful novel
","Based on the popular novel by E.L. James, Fifty Shades of Grey tells the tale of a wealthy billionaire and his lover as they pursue BDSM. Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is tasked with interviewing the wealthy mogul Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) to help her roommate. There is an evident attraction that only grows as Christian shows up in her life continuously and sends her expensive gifts. Anastasia finds his intrusions bizarre but can't help but be attracted to his wealthy lifestyle and multiple talents. <br/><br/>The movie is really boring with a plot that plods along spotted with the occasional sex scenes in a bland attempt to engage viewers and I guess appeals to women. The first book was exceptionally awful but I don't think I will ever read the second or continue the series. Grey's behavior is that of a possessive stalker and seems to be able to get away with this behavior because of his wealth and status. Anastasia resists and sees that there is still something good in this man she has come to know. She worries about his past and the older woman who corrupted him in his youth.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

","I have personally never read the book. The series didn't interest me too much since I heard about everything at work. My husband had listened to the audio tapes and said the movie should be steamy. Once the movie started we realized how boring it truly was and he told me it was not like the book. Not much steaminess, snooze fest and too many giggles from older ladies. We're going to see John Wick 2 this year instead of Fifty Shades Darker. If we decide to see fifty shades 2 we'll wait till it comes out online. Bottom line, my suggestion is not to waste money on this. If you can borrow the movie to watch for free I would do that."

","I love movies and as such it was entertaining to a certain degree and shooting scenes as well as camera angles were well placed; they kept me basically going to watch the movie to the end. Unfortunately, being a psychotherapist myself, I missed out on the why for Christian Grey's background for his ' pleasure ' phobia and having a short introduction of his mother I missed the plot regarding Christian's torment completely. I could understand Anna's attraction to the man that Christian portrayed but her misunderstanding of his pleasure for punishment unfortunately only came out only a little at the end. Controlling men aren't always the beefed up tough guys you see in the movies who yell and scream to get their way. They can be the soft-spoken boy next door or the well-educated, amiable extrovert. That was the only part well introduced in the movie. Christian uses his methods to train Anna like a puppy. When she obeys, she gets a treat. When she disobeys, she get nothing ‚Äî or worse, punishment. I was continuing to watch the movie in order to find out what made Christian the man he decided to become? Perhaps, during an his younger years he was made to feel powerless through the process of his parent/s using him to compensate for their own sense of powerlessness. Not only had his own boundaries been violated; the parent's own need to feel a sense of power had also being denied. Sometimes this continues into the next generation and again into the next. But no, the movie did not give me an answer. There are many reasons why men become controlling and abusive and the only poor reason in this film seemed to have been that Christian had grown into a rich man to compensate for something he had missed out in his childhood. Again no scene in this movie made this transparent. On the whole, I found this movie not the slightest entertaining and in a way very noneducational. I left the theater with that nagging question: Who puts this out and thinks it could be a success?The movie was nominated after all for achievement in music and two nominations for performing ' Anna ' as breakthrough performance and as an actress most in need for a new agent; the awards went on for worst movie of the year, worst picture, worst actor, worst screenplay, worst director and so on."

","I have listened to the three books of this on MP3, (even though as a late 30's male, I'm not the authors target audience,) just to keep apprised of the zeitgeist, and I mostly enjoyed them.<br/><br/>This movie was the same, even though I knew the story, it was good to see it on screen, though it was censored to the point of distraction, in that without being 'actual' pornography, you can't possibly do the writing justice, because it is 75% about sex, and not like most people are having it.<br/><br/>The sex and nudity were handled pretty tastefully, I think it wasn't as cheesy as the book in some places, but it is a bit like a really violent story like 'Ninja Turtles' being given a rating where they have to do slapstick fight scenes, you can't really simulate or water down sex and sex scenes when they are an integral part of the story and still have it translate as well.<br/><br/>The acting was fine, with the constraints that they had, I'll definitely watch the next two movies, but it isn't the authors work come to life, it's much more like those 'R rated' porno films I used to see as a kid, that didn't show insertion or genitals, a bit of a tease really.<br/><br/>But if you are after an edgy romance mixed with more kink than your usual Katherine Heigl or Cameron Diaz movie, without using too much brain power, you'll find this entertaining but you won't be squeezing your thighs together and breathing heavy like women do with the books."

","Okay, let me get a few things straight. I don't want to sound like a know-it all neither would I want to sound like a whiner for things that could not be helped. I guess, the best way would be to give out a better lay-out in hopes that it reaches those who needs to understand this film better than anyone.<br/><br/>On Acting, I think that the film was a disaster. The actors were all good to be perfectly honest, but weren't good enough for their own character development. It's a matter of how much they have been informed or how well they felt like expressing this entire novel into the big screen. <br/><br/>I'd like to note that Christian does not seem like a control freak at all and his appeal lacked too much that even the cinematics couldn't even support it ( well, to be honest. there were very vague that were even present).<br/><br/>The Plot of the story, it does follow the adaptation closely from the book version but there were some hits and miss, but it doesn't really have to be exactly what the book has to offer. if a lot of people who read the book felt like it was a disaster, I wish the screen writers had done a better job at least on giving justice as a guide to the actors.<br/><br/>I also saw someone rating it's romance? honestly, I don't think there was any romance present. Honestly tho, I think I like this better than the twilight scenario with the part that says ""I'm not good for you"" said by C.Grey, or something like that. On Drama and erotica, I was really rooting for that boat scene that never happened. It explained why exactly Christian grey wanted to beat up brunets. I wonder how they'll be constructing this now that movie 2 has been announced.<br/><br/>On the actual bed scenes, love the camera works there. I'm both wondering whether it was done and do or it was purely the camera tricks. I think I might double check on that first before I say anything but love the amazing visuals but, still I really felt that there was something lacking from there.<br/><br/>Overall. The movie itself could have been better than the Novel (Book version) but for some reasons, I guess it felt all too rushed to even appreciate what was exactly going on within the story.<br/><br/>I think it would have worked better as a direct porn."

","Before watching this movie,I have witnessed the impact of the book.Out of the people I know,only girls/women actually bought and read it.It was the center of many scandalous conversations.From the beginning,I believed it to be thrash,mainly because as I mentioned above only girls(and blonde women from some stupid TV show in the morning zone)would talk about it and it's ""dark"" sex scenes.So,even though I did not had my hopes up,I was expecting something provocative,something a bit porn/fetish like,something mainstream at least......My oh my,was I in for a surprise...The story is totally improbable,but let's say we decide to overlook that(it's a movie after all,don't need to get all realistic),the plot was going nowhere.A rich businessman with a dark door(literally) in his life,with strange appetites,a beautiful young girl with no experience,innocent but also willing to try the spices of an uncommon sex life...Nowhere near that!!There was no depth in the dialogues,they were stationery,with no essence,going in circles over nothing really.What you thought would be a kinky romance with some hard sex,was actually a messed up protagonist,very confused about what he wants,creepy and sadistic,aiming at a young girl who kept talking about what ""normal people do"",pushing for her own suffering to happen,only to regret it seconds after,leaving him forever.<br/><br/>It was obvious that the guy had problems but there was no character development,so we never learn anything that can be said in more than a sentence or two.There in so intensity anywhere,not even in the long awaited,by the masses,bdsm.I have seen butterflies f***k harder than this.There was no erotism,no romance,no drama.Just a pile of scenes,intended to look different from each other,each adding something to the movie(one drama,one romance,one depth),but with no success.The acting was not convincing to say the least and the awkwardness was so high in almost every minute of the movie that I look back at Twilight scenes and think""There is actually a worse love story than Twilight"".The only smart thing about this movie(smart in a commercial way)is that there is a ridiculously rich man involved in the story,so you get to see a bunch of serious money situations like rides with planes,helicopters,cars,huge houses with gardens,nice suits etc. and for a split second you get distracted from how hollow a movie this is....Or not :p<br/><br/>I give this movie a 3 out of 10.The only reason for this,is that when younger,I was unlucky enough to watch some zombie movies from 1960 that were so horrible I couldn't even laugh or wait till their end.Those were worth 0-1 out of 10....That is why ""50 shades of creepy/cringe and awkward"" gets a 3 and not a 1.....<br/><br/>So happy I did not pay to see this one,feelling bad for anyone that did."

Another movie in a similar vein was ""The Lover"", which was was much better done than this. Sure, ""The Lover"" had hot sex scenes, but it had character development and atmosphere too. This film would make sex seem boring to teenage boys. I didn't read the book, so I can't speak to how true it is to it, but if it did follow it closely, I can't imagine how the book could have been a success. <br/><br/>Avoid and don't waste your time."

Yes not everything was exactly like the book but they did manage to include every important little detail into just 2 hours! I have heard that Dakota was too awkward but she Jamie have managed to capture and play the characters very well! Right down to the awkward moments and the tiny little details that the book goes into such as, the looks they both give each other, the little smirks here and there, the way grey moves and the way Steele is so conflicted!

I've got to say I did as well I was also expecting not to enjoy the film, due to the reviews I was expecting it to be awful! <br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised, I disagree with many reviews which state their was no chemistry between the two, my mum and I both agree we saw a strong connection between James and Dakota. I believe people have got wrong expectations on the film, their relationship is not meant to be a loved up fairy tale, their delivery is what I would expect from characters like Anastasia and Christian. I believe many people are expecting to be this film as a loved dewy eyed romance, which it is not. However, there is definite love between Anastasia and Christian and the portrayal between James and Dakota was perfect and I enjoyed seeing their relationship develop as Christian start to deal with his issues from his past with the help of Anastasia. <br/><br/>People saying this is just a 'porno' are very much wrong, yes there are sex scenes and yes they are explicit but no more than other films which are rated 18/restricted that contain sex scenes. It is no more explicit that what you now see on television, the HBO series 'True Blood' for instance contains much more explicit sex scenes and nudity that 50 shades of grey, the fact that many people are shocked with the sex scenes is astonishing. The film is based on a sexual relationship, so this should be expected and again as previously mentioned much worse is shown on television. The difference is this sex is explored differently through BDSM.<br/><br/>Overall a great film can not wait for the sequel."

There was maybe 4 sex scenes in the whole movie and they were R rated, you wont see anymore sex or nudity in this movie than in any other movie with sex scenes and they were only like maybe 5-10 seconds long. I kept waiting for that one really good sex scene that everyone seemed to say was so bad but it never happened. So really? everyone is complaining about R rated sex scenes? give me a break.

I'm a 30 year old female, married, i enjoy my sex-life with my husband and don't need bdsm etc to spice up my life, so seriously people stop it with your silly reviews and be realistic here. the story isn't about the successful Christian Grey and how he achieved his $$$$$, its a love story between two people, an innocent girl who is a virgin and her first sexual experience with someone who is bdsm pro. yes maybe it gives the wrong idea about bdsm etc... but who the hell cares?? u enjoy the chemistry between the two, you learn that personality is the most important trait whether you are dating a millionaire or a thousandaire (yes i just made up that word). the story is just like the book, i knew exactly where things were heading... and it was enjoyable. i took my husband who initially wanted to shoot himself but then thought it was so so. (clearly he did not read the book). the set and ambiance of the movie was perfect. just as described in book. go watch it and if you have something bad to say, please spear us as we have read a million horrible reviews already.

Crazy. I have read the trilogy many times and have seen the movie twice. I am so happy with the finished product.<br/><br/>I didn't care for Dakota or Jamie when they were first cast as Anastasia & Christian. The wait from book to movie was so long - I think every fan had their own Ana & Christian picked out. I went into the movie with an open mind and I was so pleased. Dakota was awesome and I think Jamie did a good job portraying our troubled billionaire Christian Grey. For people that say there was no chemistry - you must have seen a different movie than I did. I could see Anastasia falling in love with Christian and he was fighting his feelings for her because he doesn't think he deserves her. <br/><br/>The film moved fast and some scenes were changed or shortened. For example, the drunk dialing scene in the club was hilarious and better than how the story was told in the book. The first book is 514 pages long - hard to put everything into an approx. 140 minute movie. <br/><br/>For people that say Ana was raped and abused-that is just absurd. Ana had all the power. The sex was consensual between 2 adults. At no time was she abused or raped. The sex scenes were beautiful and tastefully done. <br/><br/>For those reviewers that are saying it's sending a bad message to young girls. The movie is rated ""R"" no one under 17 should be viewing the film. But I really don't see all the hoopla about the sex. I have HBO and Showtime and I've seen must more explicit sex sitting in my family room watching my TV than what is portrayed in 50 Shades.<br/><br/>The movie captured the essence of the first book and I can't wait for Fifty Shades Darker. <br/><br/>Haters - stay home."

"hannahszal","10","3","8","23 December 2018"," The Best Movie I've Ever Seen
","When I say that I went into this movie with low expectations, that's just because I had no expectations at all. The only way I could describe Fifty Shades was as a ""BDSM thing with a lot of sex"" without being able to go any further than that. So, when I watched the movie for the first time without reading the books, I was just giving it a fair chance since it looked interesting and I was curious about it. And after seeing it for the first time, I was very impressed.<br/><br/>When people say this movie is ""bad"", clearly they've never seen a bad movie in their life. Fifty Shades isn't a porn, abuse, rape or whatever such nonsense that people come up with, and it's so much more than that anf just becomes a lot more special than people,give it credit for. I can really appreciate a movie where I can go into it and have a lot to think/talk about as it's very easy to find the hidden gems within a story like this. Yes, it has a lot of sex; so what? That means nothing to a story about two people falling in love with each other, even when they know deep down that it could never work and the contract serves as a metaphor for an obstacle that I'm pretty sure people experience in their lives. There's so much more to the story than just the sex.<br/><br/>Not only that, this was the first time I had ever heard of Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, but all it took was the first ten minutes for me to see that they had something special about them. And I still feel that to this day. They made me care about the characters and for the first time in my life, I was able to relate to them in more ways than I could have ever imagined. Thanks to them, I no longer feel alone.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this, don't listen to the negativity as people have no idea what they're talking about. Calling this ""bad"" or ""unrealistic"" would be like saying that Titanic never happened; the event, not the movie. It's anything but bad and this was the first time when I couldn't breathe, move, or speak--with the exception of the word ""wow""--when watching a movie. And honestly, it felt like either the first movie ever made or the first good movie that I've seen in a long time. I mean it when I say that this is the best movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Again, DON'T LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS. Fifty Shades os a perfect example of how idiots could criticize a good movie without having anything to back up their claims. Maybe if they could bother to see more than just the sex and BDSM, then maybe it wouldn't be as bad as they thought. You can't criticize anything when you know nothing about it; Fifty Shades is no different.<br/><br/>This movie/series has changed my life and overall, I'm not an idiot; I recognize talent when I see it. Just give this movie a chance and don't let the haters change your mind. They wouldn't know a good movie even if someone pointed it out."
"piercehadj","1","3","8","20 June 2015"," The Downfall of Film
","I'd just like to start by saying that this ""film"" stands as an insult to the very foundations of the film industry. It's success hinges on women and adolescent school girls who find the idea of BDSM as romantic or enticing but yet make the firm labels of ""violence against women is wrong"" and ""men are the enemy, look what they do to women"". Look I'll pull away from that because that's not the point. The story is the tag line of a soft core porno which somehow made it on to the big screen, that's society for you. The acting is laughable, I mean I've seen children show more talent when refusing to eat broccoli. The artistic value is non existent. The screenplay and cinematography is well below par and to cap off the fact that this film made as much money as it did is once again a disgraceful reflection on society today. I can't walk through a shopping mall without it being shoved in my face every 10 seconds. So now I pose the question, why was this made into a film? Why was this given priority screening, unreasonable budget and promotion when there is about a billion other idealistic teens, adults and film makers who could think up a more satisfactory, resonating story in the snap of a finger. I'm really appalled at the commercial success of this ""film"" and really hope that this doesn't start the trend of poor films. Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg and about a thousand other film makers didn't give their lives to the film industry for it to become this cesspool of filth."

","I have not read the book. But my girl read it and from her i got inspired to watch this movie. As we know most novel turned in to movie comes a bit different and kind of a tasty. But what I found here is all fishy. A story of a young money who throws a huge amount of money to satisfy his own sexual appetite. That should be the bottom line. OK lets add a bit more, he wants that only in his way. Then what else? I couldn't even found the space for a psychological insight, philosophy or motivating factors. They way Mr. Christian describes the root of his problem carried as much weight as that of a fishing tour or a golf conversation. <br/><br/>What It established in the first place is money can get all. OK its a real truth. But I have not ever seen such a gross representation of it. The point of sodomy was not even clearly established. In this respect I would say ""A Dangerous Method"" is way better. I'm really surprised that I had to waste almost 2 hours out of some dumb inspiration. Thank you."

Me and my wife hasn't been in cinema for a while, because of our baby, so maybe that is why we did like it so much. I saw reviews and quite poor scoring but somehow we was so enjoying that movie that we even realized that was already 2h when the movie finished. Simple romantic story, like most of Hollywood stories so if you expect something more from this movie you will get disappointed. About the sex scenes in the movie....well. There is much nudity in all movies now that this one didn't make much difference so I just put that on the second plan."
"kellysantana","2","3","8","18 February 2015"," I've never been more disappointed in a movie adaptation of a book
","My opinion may be quite harsh, but these are my all time favorite books. This has quite possibly been the WORST movie adaptation of a book I've ever seen in my life. I hated the Twilight movies, but they still rank higher on my list than this movie. I was very disappointed. Now I know movies can never compare to the actual books (although movies like The Hunger Games and Divergent did an incredible job), but this movie did not stay true to ANYTHING in the book, not even the relationship and growing connection between Ana and Christian. The actors had zero chemistry. ""Christian"" was cold, distant, and callous throughout the ENTIRE film. Yes, I know Christian does not seek an actual relationship with Ana in this book, but you can still see how much he starts to truly care for her throughout the book. This was not shown AT ALL in the movie. There are key moments in the book that demonstrate how much Christian truly cares for Ana (Like the first time Christian sleeps over Ana's house), moments that were not added into the film. How could things like that possibly be taken out?! The movie progressively gets worse and worse. Throughout maybe the first half hour of the film, I was hopeful that it would all turn out great. But once the bar scene is over and Ana wakes up at The Heathman, it all goes down hill. The end was laughable to me. Anyone with a closed mind who has not read the books and watches this film, will definitely say the books must be as bad as they thought. All that seems to matter in this movie is the sex- which in my opinion, was not that great. It's not the sex that made fans fall in love with these books- Though it could have been what initially drew them to it- it's the amazing, beautiful, and incredible love story of an innocent girl and a tormented man. This movie completely misses that point. I don't think I'll ever re- watch this movie because I don't want it to taint the wonderful image I have of the Christian and Ana that I know from the books. It seems like the writers of this movie wanted to add in all the ""big"" scenes from the books- like graduation, the trip to Georgia, dinner at Christian's parents'- but it was beyond rushed. You can tell they tried very hard to cram all of these scenes into two hours on screen. But it was a failed attempt, as all of the extremely important details were missed. Even the small details that somehow made it, were added in WRONG. How could the Ana of this film say she's falling in love with Christian, when there's zero connection between the two throughout the entire movie? It was bland and boring. The only thing that I really enjoyed was the occasional humor that lightens the sexually tense and charged mood of the film. Everything else was honestly garbage. I couldn't stop laughing by the end- and it was NOT a good kind of laugh."
"bobjr94","3","3","8","17 February 2015"," Typical poorly written love story
","First thing I though was it seemed like a twilight rip-off, then I come back and read it started as a fan written twilight spin off story.<br/><br/>Second thing is it's not porn, don't listen to the others who keep saying that. Likely they have never watched it and on moral reasons are posting bad reviews and giving it 0 stars.<br/><br/>The sex scenes were pretty toned down for what I was expecting, not even full frontal for either actor, just lots of close up boobs. You see more than that on an HBO series. The bondage scenes were pretty short also, a minute or two and they are done and she's being carried off to bed.<br/><br/>It features a fairly poor and uninteresting girl (like Bella) who suddenly has a rich guy from a wealthy family chasing after her (twilight again) who keeps telling her to get away from me you won't like me but come back I want you (twilight story again).<br/><br/>Both main characters were kind of jerks. He was kept telling her she can leave, you wont like me once you get to know me. So she would leave, he would track her down, just about kidnap her then bring her right back. She kept teasing him with that stupid contract. OK change it and Ill sign it, just kidding I won't sign it, yes I will sign it, let me think about it but have sex with me now anyway, I don't like you but I want to make you breakfast and go on dates...<br/><br/>My first thought was, why does he not just hire a girl to serve his needs ? He can get a high class, discrete, strictly business girl that will do exactly what he wants, when he wants. He admits she is girl #16, so none of the first 15 he ever had feeling for, nor they for him ? For whatever reason she was the first one ? Seems unlikely."

","Dear female (non-feminist) reviewers<br/><br/>Simply putting adjectives like 'amazing' in capital letters and adding some exclamation marks does not a review make. Nor is it a sign of sexual inhibition to hate the franchise and everything it stands for - rather the opposite is true, I'd say. Finally, the fact that the adaption is like the book, is not, in itself, any kind of recommendation. Instead, you may ask yourself why you'd be interested in a film about an unpleasant bully who forces a patently slow-witted woman into increasingly brutal sexual practices because he likes abusing women. In fact, it couldn't be any clearer, he actually says he can only get off with women when he's inflicting pain on them! Why would this actually appeal to anyone without severe self-esteem issues?"
"justinktobin","7","3","8","16 February 2015"," Better Than The Novel
","I have a tendency to read the books before the film nowadays, whereas I used to read the book after - if I enjoyed the film. The former applies to Fifty Shades. I began it in 2012, got about a third of the way though and got very bored. I hurried along when I knew the movie was coming soon. I gave the book a 2 out of 5 on Goodreads, or 4 out of 10 on my scale.<br/><br/>The writing is juvenile, and reads at the grade five reading level. It is a book marketed to adults, but it is embarrassing to read as an adult. The dialogue is very corny and doesn't flow naturally. This is where the film is better than the book. Yes, the dialogue is still poor, but it seems more natural than the novel. Here's an example. When Christian pushes Jos√© and says something like, ""She said no, man!"" But, in the book it's something like, ""I think the lady said 'no'."" That clich√©d line really stuck with me and in a way, it sums up how trite the novel is.<br/><br/>Much of the audience reactions were that of surprise, which made me wonder how many had actually read the book. Even the abrupt ending had the audience gasping. I knew it would end abruptly, because this film is based on book one, which segues into book two and three. I don't really plan on reading the second and third books, unless film adaptations are gonna be released.<br/><br/>The sex scenes were quite tame compared to the book, which is expected, otherwise it would have gotten an NC-17 rating, which most theatres won't carry. There's a tampon scene in the book, which is basically Christian having sex with Anastasia while she is on her period. But, this isn't in the film.<br/><br/>A lot of the novel has internal monologue from Anastasia's perspective, and her thoughts and emotions don't translate to the screen well. She has multiple orgasms in the book, on more than one occasion, but it isn't in the film. The scenes do, however, show that she enjoys herself very much as a consenting submissive who is yet to sign a contract with her dominant, Christian Grey.<br/><br/>The viewer has to suspend disbelief about Christian being a self-made billionaire who knows people well. For a CEO who has a strong work ethic, he seems to have a lot of free time on his hands, and lives more like a trust fund baby from billionaire parents.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent, from the opening aerial shots to the one-point perspective of the elevator doors closing at the end. The two lines spoken by the main characters are ""Anastasia"" and ""Christian.""<br/><br/>With over two hours of screen time, this film would be much shorter minus the sex scenes. And like the rest of the cinematography, these scenes are filmed well. They do a good job to eroticize the sex, although I did let out a laugh here and there. Then there's a scene at the end where we feel Anastasia's pain, which seems more emotional than physical.<br/><br/>There isn't much of a deeper meaning or theme. There aren't many shades; it is pretty much black and white. Like the book, Christian describes himself as being fifty shades f****d up. We don't know much about him other than he is a billionaire of a company we know little about, he has mysterious marks on his chest, he was adopted, his real mother was a crack whore, and he is a talented pianist, and he can fly a helicopter. He doesn't smile much, and has an intense stare. He is not a psychopath, but he seems to only be able to express his sexual interest through sadomasochism. He himself was once a submissive. His mother's friend was his dominant when he was fifteen. Okay, so does this explain his behaviour? Yeah, they're consenting adults, but Anastasia wants more than just kinky sex. She is saddened by his constant desire to punish her, even though she enjoys it. She wants more. She wants a loving ""normal"" relationship.<br/><br/>While this film of Fifty Shades of Grey is better than the novel, it is still not an excellent film. The director really didn't have much of a script to work with, but she did a good job considering the bland plot. I would go so far as to put it in a comedy genre. Even more comical that it was released on the week of Valentine's Day. Also, males may even enjoy it more than females, since it shows more female nudity and orgasmic expressions. I give the film a 7 out of 10, but maybe I would have given it a 6 out of 10 if not seen in theatre, since I find the theatrical experience always adds to my enjoyment.<br/><br/><ul><li>Justin</li></ul>"

","I hadn't read the book before seeing this film, and I was fully aware of the poor reception it had received, so to be honest, I wasn't expecting much. Sometimes though, a film becomes so huge that it simply HAS to be seen.<br/><br/>On the whole, it was average, although not as dreadful as I'd feared. The whole film oozes style and opulence, the clothing (when worn), Mr Grey's luxurious penthouse, the obscenely expensive modes of transport, it goes on.<br/><br/>In some ways, the film could have been made in the 1980s, a decade when films depicting gaudy shows of wealth were commonplace.<br/><br/>While Dakota Johnson did a pretty good job as Anastasia,, the film fell down with Mr Grey himself. I loved Jamie Dornan's masterclass as Paul Spector in The Fall, but I can only describe his performance in 50 Shades as flat. Maybe it's the character rather than the actor, but almost zero charisma, and with little to offer beyond his material side, Grey is an appropriate surname.<br/><br/>I've seen loads of films and dramas that chart the progress of a doomed relationship, and if it's any good, I feel genuine sadness when the end comes. In this case though, when the lift doors closed and the credits started to roll, all I thought was ""is that it?"""

","True to the book. One important scene was lame; beginning interview of Christian (missed the mark). One scene was totally Twilight (guy pulls girl in, guy pushes girl away, and we're back). There definitely were intense moments/overwhelming moments. There are lots of boob views, but if ya read the book, then you should be aware that there's actual sex and nudity. Why does seeing breasts make you uncomfortable? We were all born with them. There were funny parts, but not because of cheese. Ended up liking both performers even tho they weren't my first choice, but who cares, none of us average joes get to choose the actors. It ends as it began, but so, we read the books, we know what happens (if not, YOUR choice). The book author was awful, who cares, hundreds of thousands bought it, the movie isn't written words that we are reading. This isn't a true BDSM portrayal, who cares, it opened the eyes of hundred of thousands to something they didn't know about or were ashamed to try, shall we continue to be so narrow minded and naive, enlighten our minds, so that we understand and know ourselves better. Women above the age of 30 are ""all"" reading it, who cares, why do you have to label them soccer moms and etc. Many females who read it don't have kids. It's porn, who cares, have a little fun, you won't go to hell for trying or liking it. It's rape, um, I beg to differ, the fictitious character consented, so, A it's not real and B she left at times, but always came back for more, equals not rape. It's emotionally disturbing, whelp life isn't made up solely as a box of chocolates! The male character had a severely traumatized childhood, give him a break to learn and grow, we're all only human, not perfect Mrs. Beaver. He's a controlling abusive freak, whelp, he isn't always and some people choose to give up control for a time, don't judge, to each their own. Overall, it was entertaining and I enjoyed it!"

Well, they won't get them, any reality out of the film.<br/><br/>Who would enjoy the film to the max? A housewife, a student, a normal chick or a male with tender heart that believes in great virtue of love and giving, will do.<br/><br/>I have seen loads of film in all genres, inland, outland, outside wold, including the real BDSM. The Fifty shades of Grey has given me a newness, romance+sadism. I don't doubt anymore why the books are so popular.<br/><br/>BDSM to what I know shallowly, some died for the play. Mr. Hogan did it alone in a closet at a Luxy hotel. Japanese geisha and her master. It sounds limitless. I'm not a BSDM fan or an anti, just a regular observer who looks to entertain meself when it's possible.<br/><br/>Here are some key ingredients one average brain will need to enjoy the film: <br/><br/><ul><li>Read those 1/10 reviews, </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Have some prejudices but be expectation less, </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Let the film leads you, </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Watch it alone, </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Don't try to make sense of the film, </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>and don't read the book! That's it. Can't help those who have read the books before film.</li></ul><br/><br/>The film is not only about sex, sex-y, and sex-uality. It offers high romance, sexiness, curiosity, and fantasy. It ain't real and only here to entertain.<br/><br/>Perfect thrilling soundtracks and good choice of actors: Dakota Johnson does represent an average sensual girl and Jamie Dornan, an occult young billionaire. They certainly have loads of chemistry in a dark-cold-curious way. Want some spice mushroom chemicals? imagine, Chalie Hunnum would play this part with a blond silicon boobs chic. That is a making of part four of Lost in Las Vegas."

"feezya","10","5","17","27 February 2015"," To be seen with open mind
","IMO this movie is actually made for the fans of the books since i find some of the dialogs were choppy. A lot of crucial scenes (not even referring to the sex scenes) were left out, and this made the movie less ""understandable"" for non-readers. I went with a friend who didn't read the book and she had lots of questions and issues. She read the books after, and only then she said its actually quite good. But movies are rarely good as the books they were adapted from, mostly due to time constraint. Other than that, I was surprised how good Dakota is as naive Ana. And Jamie isn't bad either; being the impassive Christian who we can see certainly enjoyed Ana's company even though he tried to stay away at first. Could see the mercurial moods he's in esp at the end scene, displaying Christian struggling with his inner demons but certainly getting his cathartic release when belting Ana. The musics were great, sex scenes tastefully done which is why i really don't understand people calling it porn.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 10 because it definitely doesn't deserves the 1 that people are giving it. I truly hope you actually judge it AFTER watching it yourself and not just jumping on bandwagons of haters and those trying to take advantage of this film's huge popularity (good and bad) to voice out their opinions on whatever causes they are fighting for from feminism, abuse, BDSM etc.<br/><br/>Strongly suggesting you go in the cinema with an open mind, without any expectation, and leave all the negative comments you've read outside the cinema.

Just like when twilight first came out the first movie sucked from the acting, but after a little it started to get better. So judging this movie from just the start up is pretty much you having a stick up your butt the whole time. People reading all of the reviews don't get discouraged their all just butt hurt and its tragic. The only thing that kinda got to me was how much nudity it had. Of course lots of teenage perverts at my school loved those parts but still. And it should get you thinking that even the males thought it was a good movie not just because it had nudity but because it was an actual funny movie that made you laugh here and there. And most people haven't even read the book or seen the movie but came and rated it because they thought it was degrading to women,.

"StevePulaski","4","4","13","14 February 2015"," The blandest shades in a colorful portrait
","The film adaptation of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is exactly the kind of film that makes me seriously question the tastes of the mainstream and the approach Hollywood utilizes in adapting bestselling novels into films. To cut through all the evasive language and answer those reading this review have, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is a horribly mediocre film, timid and unsatisfying in its depiction of the bondage and BDSM subculture, with dialog and acting that are frequently astonishing in how awful they can be. Having never read the E.L. James' trilogy, I, the ignorant, take a look at the film adaptation and have to question, like I did with the film adaptations of the ""Hunger Games"" trilogy and ask myself, ""is this really the root of the phenomenon?"" Just by watching ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" an ignorant soul has to assume that this is a muted representation of the book. A juicy, erotic book about bondage, which was said to describe sex acts in explicit detail, had to have been more graphic than what we got on-screen, and the characters, I sincerely hope, had to be more than empty vessels, as they were in the film at hand. What we get for the film version of the book isn't a piece of work without merit, but a drearily boring and safe depiction of a topic and a culture that deserve more respect, especially given this film being the mainstream break for both.<br/><br/>The story follows Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), a depressingly ordinary college girl, who goes through life without many close friends outside her roommate leads an existence of convention and routine. This changes when her roommate asks her to interview Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), an elusive, single billionaire who's consistent protection of his private life has warranted great question. From the moment she sees him, Anastasia is smitten with everything about him because he is everything she isn't: bold, confident, unafraid, and suave.<br/><br/>One can tell just from the way Christian looks and speaks to Anastasia, having great patience and acceptance with her that he admires her for her own traits as well: she's simple, frightened, vulnerable, and just the kind of girl he's looking for. The two quietly hit it off, with Christian requesting simple things like coffee outings and simple hangouts before going through one of his many periods of being standoffish and confusing to Anastasia. Eventually, he reveals his motives; he's looking for a sexual relationship with no commitments and no conventionality in terms of going on dates. He wants sex and he wants it his way, proposing a contract to Anastasia in hopes she will become the submissive to his dominant, in which she'll stay at his spacious penthouse on weekends to engage in wild sexual escapades.<br/><br/>I love the idea of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" being made into a film because it would make a topic that is so taboo and mainstream and force it into the limelight, optimistically making it something that more people would talk about. I was immediately frustrated when it was given an R rating, greatly limiting the impact of its presumably explicit sex scenes and resulting in a failed opportunity to also make the NC-17 more commercial and profitable (but that's another argument). To begin with, the sex scenes are a hair more graphic than what mainstream America is used to, but they're depressingly ordinary compared to what kind of emotions usually arise from BDSM activity. There isn't a lot to say with the scenes, surprisingly, and that's the biggest issue with them from the start.<br/><br/>Johnson and Dornan fit their roles pretty well, in terms of accentuating the traits they need to and giving off the kind of vibes they need to as well. However, the two completely lack any kind of chemistry together. Maybe that's intentional, again alluding to Grey's refusal to make this a relationship of any conventionality, but it's difficult to get wrapped up in the sex scenes when both parties seem disinterested in one another and bored. Furthermore, the acting of the two leads varies from acceptable to incredibly poor and contrived, leading to the final nail in the coffin being the film's dialog.<br/><br/>""Fifty Shades of Grey"" may go down as one of the most poorly-written films of the film year in terms of having singular lines of dialog that are capable of producing unintentional laughs and sneers. Lines like ""laters, baby,"" which Grey always says to Anastasia, ""I'm fifty shades of f***** up,"" as said by Grey, and a multitude of others that need greater context are uttered to cringe-worthy effect. Combine the element of brazenly bad dialog with unremarkable sex scenes and an an overall vapid portrayal of a sex subculture, and you have a film that flatlines when it should captivate and stun.<br/><br/>The film, as I stated, isn't without its own merit. The cinematography is bleak but paradoxically inviting, with Seamus McGarvey making the color gray about as vibrant as it can be, so much so that infusing other colors effectively changes the mood of the audience as it does the characters. The contrast established between the characters functioning in the outside world and the characters functioning behind clothes doors is present, and McGarvey communicates that very well through look and tone, with screenwriter Kelly Marcel (writer of ""Saving Mr. Banks"") effectively doing it in dialog. Furthermore, the way the film creates a world established by these two characters that is left mostly uncorrupted by the opinions and interference of outside forces also helps it in establishing a level ground in its own world. But such features are secondary to the primary features, which should've been a lot more fleshed out and detailed than what was provided in a lackluster portrayal of an exciting idea."
"HGRebels","10","5","18","19 February 2015"," Absolutely brilliant
","I feel like most people only went to see this film for the sex scenes. And if that's the reason you want to go, don't. The book and film are not just about sex and I wish people would see that instead of expecting that they're going to see porn on the big screen. The book and film are about their ""love"" for each other and the fact people are saying that its degrading to women is the stupidest thing I've heard. She wants it. She asks for it. How is it rape in any form? If you've read the book like myself you will very much enjoy the movie as it was a great reconstruction of the book. Very annoyed with the fact people are voting the film down because there's ""not enough sex"". DO NOT go if you're only going to see the sex scenes because there isn't as many as you would expect. Overall a brilliant film and I am very, very impressed and happy I went to see it."

People who deny it being great will ruin the chances of the next movie which is crazy! And really not every moment or thought of YOURS can be specifically pulled and put on screen... Get real and don't ruin Jaime or Dakota's chances of signing back on! Idiots go find another book and Don't see the movie. This was GREAT and I watched it twice. The books were only better because I've read them all and the movies aren't all available now which is sad. I believe if all 3 movies were out judging by this first one I would be in heaven just like I was with the books the movies that great. I'm just sad they can't have the entire series of movies done now, makes me want to read the books again :) great movie!!! Rate positive people we need the sequels! Great start"
"MartinHafer","3","3","9","25 September 2018"," If everyone hates the film and it has a 4.1....why did it make so much money?!
","I never had any intention of watching ""Fifty Shades of Grey""...none. However, when IMDB recently revamped their Bottom 100 List and I saw the movie was now on the list, I felt I had to see it. After all, I constantly am checking out the list to see what new additions there are so I can watch them. I do occasionally like seeing a bad movie...they can be very entertaining and unintentionally funny. Now ""Fifty Shades"" is very different from any other film on the list (with the exception of ""The Last Airbender"") in that it WAS a mega-hit and lots of people liked it...though at the same time its score of 4.1 on IMDB is anemic....making it a love-hate sort of picture.<br/><br/>Anastasia Steele (great name, huh?) is a dim sort of lady....and I'm sorry but there's no better way to describe her accurately. When she goes to interview a big-shot businessman, Christian Grey, she has no idea what she's doing, hasn't prepared in the least and asks him only banal questions. She seemed rather dull and with little personality and it was difficult to see what he saw in her. Yet, despite this, inexplicably Grey is now obsessed with her. In some ways, he seems like a nice guy--such as coming to her aid when she's drunk in a dance club soon after this meeting. But in many, he gives so many signs that he's not normal in the least...and rather creepy and possibly very dangerous. He's incredibly controlling and in response to her getting drunk he says ""If you were mine, you wouldn't be able to sit down for a week"". In other words, for getting drunk and behaving stupidly, he'd paddle the crap out of her! He then has her sign a non-disclosure agreement--saying she'll never tell anyone about him!! Soon, they are embarking on a weird S&M relationship...and that's when the film shows a lot of nekkidness, though it's of the soft-core variety. But he is clear...this is NOT love and he doesn't want to be close to anyone...and he doesn't even want to actually sleep with her...just have his way with her.<br/><br/>What I find so bizarre about the whole ""Fifty Shades"" phenomenon is that in the 21st century, the actions of BOTH Anastasia and Christian are the exact opposite of what society is telling us folks should be like or what romance should be. There really ISN'T any romance...and he doesn't want to date her. It's not so much just the S&M aspects that I found bothersome...it's more that you have a man who dominates a woman and controls her and she is passive and does whatever he says. Her needs are also not particularly important and he wants to control every aspect of her life and breaks into her apartment when she isn't home. This is NOT the feminist idea of today...at least not what folks SAY they want in a relationship. I simply do not understand this dichotomy...nor why folks loved the books and films...yet also claim to hate them! I also worry that a film like this could set the stage for date rapes, as here in the film it's supposed to be romantic...but in real life, it could get you imprisoned. Weird.<br/><br/>So although I found the message strange and possibly dangerous and the writing occasionally silly, what about the techincal aspects of the movie? The movie is very polished--with lovely and very appropriate music, excellent cinematography and is very artistic. For this reason alone, although I didn't like or respect the message, the film deserves more than a few stars on IMDB. <br/><br/>I should add that although the film features a lot of nudity, I really didn't find it all that exciting to watch...mostly because the film was just creepy. It also didn't come off as sexy....just creepy. And, it probably would NOT be a great date night film...as your date might think you are...just creepy. Watch it if you'd like...I just didn't particular enjoy it nor understand WHY it made so much money...I just found it, believe it or not, to be rather dull."

","There isn't a Razzie Award that this movie hasn't locked up. To say that the acting rivals that of those churned out by the porn industry is an insult to porn actors. Also, the extent of passion, emotion, and sensuality also pales compared to most porn movies. This is a big budget movie created for the same people willing to lower themselves into the sewers of literature and read the book, i.e., immature, unsophisticated morons who probably giggle at the inept attempt at eroticism here. I was completely surprised at how average looking the leads were. And aside from absolutely no chemistry between them, how horrible their acting (and everyone else in the movie) was. This isn't by any means a love story. This is a story about how Hollywood is willing to make this kind of crap to take money away from emotionally stunted, lonely, sexually repressed individuals who still think this joke of a story can happen to them. Thank god I got the DVD from the library and didn't waste any money on this trash."

"bbenitez305","8","3","9","24 February 2015"," This movie was everything !
","I don't even know where to begin with this review, but i just want to point out a few things about the film in parallel with the book. Number one, a movie based on a book will never be exactly like the book. So don't set standards thinking the movie has to be up to par with the reading, Because it simply cannot. Books have the luxury of being detailed as ever! Movies and books cant go hand in hand. Now that we got that out of the way. ... The movie itself in my opinion of course, was perfect. I've read many reviews of people complaining about the lack of chemistry both of the main characters had between one another and when i watched the movie I was confused because the chemistry they both had was perfect!<br/><br/>Anastasia is naturally suppose to be this average chick, who is intimidated by this handsome billionaire.<br/><br/>Naturally, shes surprised that she even scored a guy like Chrisitian Grey.<br/><br/>Thats that.<br/><br/>Everyone is attacking the fact about Grey's choice in his sexual life , being a dominant and having a submissive. The face of the matter is, it exists. Second, its a freaking movie people. Don't get angry over a demonstration of how BDSM community can or cannot be. You don't like it ? cool. you do? cool.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, the movie is a freaking love story. Read the books! Christian Grey isn't a dominant forever. He grew up differently then other young boys, he's only living up to what he grew up with but Anastasia comes around and changes the game for him.<br/><br/>Stop being so stuck up on the storyline at the surface.<br/><br/>Be open minded. Its all about perspective.<br/><br/>By the way, the person i went to see this movie with, was a guy. Who hadn't read the book or know anything about it. I briefly told him what it was about based on the books and he was down to see it with me...ANNNND he loved it ! low-key. <br/><br/>Perspective people."

"melbeau6","8","3","9","21 February 2015"," it was pretty interesting
","There definitely are spoilers in this review so if you are going to read it-- only read it if you have already watched the movie!!<br/><br/>I hadn't planned on watching this movie. Actually, I was opposed to watching this movie (d/t the S&M content i had heard was in it) in the beginning. However, I found myself in a town where I know no one and my husband is out of town for a few months. I went to the nearest theater and this movie was the only movie that was playing in the next 30 min that seemed like the most appealing at the time. <br/><br/>I am totally against the whole S & M thing. However, when watching this movie and learning about ""his"" background (what he knew about his birth mother, being adopted and his 6 year relationship with his mother's friend) and how he explains his ""knowing people"" it made sense. <br/><br/>I don't understand why people were so disappointed by it. I wasn't expecting explicit sex scenes.. or a deep drawn out explanation of why he was the way he was, etc.. it seemed harmless enough. He didn't seem to be much older than her-- what? maybe 3 or 4 years older? How was he creepy? He seems young enough to still be trying to figure out what love and relationships are all about. It didn't seem he was looking for a submissive-- that was all he knew, it seemed like he was looking for an equal. <br/><br/>I like the ending and how it mirrored their beginning.. good twist there!! For a movie I expected to ""totally dislike""-- it was actually pretty good."
"olivia_mrhody","7","3","9","20 February 2015"," I don't get all the negativity
","I realize that this may be the highest review this movie has and I have my reasons. Most people that gave it much lower scores and I have noticed that they are sorted into two main categories. First: those that were disappointed in the amount of sexual encounters. For these people I have to say: go check your local porn section is you want hardcore sex. Your expectations for outrageous sex are misplaced. It's rated R for a reason, not X. They did not want to market this as porn. Following the book too closely would have been a mistake. The second category is those that find the acting to be sub-par. To you I'd say you have to much prejudice. The actors they chose seemed to fit the characters better than the typical mainstream. The directing was not terrible. Looking at the actors from the point of view their previous works holds prejudice of what you think they accomplished in this film and frankly it is unfair. I don't see what all the negativity was about. I was entertained the entire time. People that read the books (I did) were too judgmental of its closeness (or lack thereof) to them while people that did not read them were either lost, or judgmental because ""it wasn't what it was portrayed to be."" You want to pick on some acting check out The Twilight Saga. The first movie has the worst acting I've ever seen. More the most part I think people were upset that they didn't see any of his junk. People really need to lay off. And the next ones will only be better."
"umaiamalika","6","3","9","19 February 2015"," It was OK
","OK, it was not the best movie of the world but is not that bad either, <br/><br/>So I'd give you a few advises:<br/><br/>1. If you haven't read the book, don't see it 2. If you read the book but didn't understand it, don't see it 3. If you're expecting the hot steamy sex she describes in the book, don't go see it, 4. If you have a square mind, don't go see it either.<br/><br/>They couldn't put all the sex scene just as she describes it in the book because is not a porno movie, is erotic, which is not the same. <br/><br/>Sure the dialogue was cheesy but is a romantic, with eroticism, every romantic/love story has cheesy lines.<br/><br/>Is not domestic abuse, didn't see anyone complaining about it when Secretary came out,saying that was sexual harassment in the line of work, not comparing acting cause James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal are supreme actors, but the topic is the same; a person with a kinky hobby <br/><br/>It wasn't rape, she was very willing on to being with him. <br/><br/>and finally this was a better love story than the force love triangle between a pale skin pedophile, a codependent, dumb teenager and a dog on steroids (bet you know which series of movie I'm referring)."
"owlman22","8","3","9","18 February 2015"," Ratings are a joke for this movie!
","There is NO way that this movie deserves the ratings that so many have given to it. If you don't approve of the subject matter, fine, but then you shouldn't be seeing the movie in the first place. If you're trying to deliver a message, no matter how misguided, then you shouldn't do it by giving the movie a ""1""--that doesn't help anyone! Could the movie have been better, sure it could. Could it have developed the characters even more, of course it could, but then it would have been a 3-4 hour movie. My wife and I felt that this movie fairly reflected the key elements of book #1. OK, it didn't cover everything, but no movie can or should, and it's an unfair standard to grade the movie against.<br/><br/>We thought Dakota Johnson as Ana was outstanding in carrying her part with subtlety and finesse. We found that we got angry at the character in the book for being so flighty/flaky at times, while this Ana caused me to understand the level of confusion and frustration that she was experiencing. Jamie Dornan could have been stronger, but he grew on us as the movie progressed, and he did an overall satisfactory job.<br/><br/>The production values on this film were top notch. I never felt that we were seeing a tawdry representation of the book, and I know that the characters will continue to show even more depth as the story unfolds in the subsequent editions.<br/><br/>In summary, I find I really get frustrated with the type of voting and critical review behavior evidenced for this movie. If someone doesn't like a movie for a reason, don't automatically rate it a ""1"" in order to overstate your point to make a statement. I've seen some pretty bad movies, but rarely do I ever dip below a ""4"" on the scale. If it's worse than that, I've already turned it off or left the theater."
"ArchonCinemaReviews","2","3","9","17 February 2015"," An atrocity, more kink and originality in a 4 minute pop song by Rihanna than this 125 minute film
","You've heard from all the rest, now hear from the best movie site about this year's biggest mistake: Fifty Shades of Grey.<br/><br/>You might be surprised by this fact, but this twenty-something female never read the 50 Shades series by E.L. James. As a member of the novel's target demographic fan base, you know the group that allegedly goes gaga for this crap, let me break it down for you folks out there.<br/><br/>Even if you avoided hearing about Fifty Shades of Grey with a fervent effort, you probably were susceptible to some information about the film and book series. You know, assuming you don't live under a rock or are some survivalist living off the grid while you prepare for the end of the world. So a summary of the film and series is basically unnecessary. There's this meek girl named Anastasia Steele who meets a billionaire named Christian Grey. For some inexplicable reason they are captivated by one another and their lust-affair begins.<br/><br/>Who here has watched porn? For those of you that didn't raise your hand, please skip to the next paragraph. For those of you who did, or should have because you are a liar, then read on. So you know that formula in porn, doesn't matter if its teacher-student, boss-secretary or housewife-handyman the recipe remains the same: BS dialogue to feign a reason for these two (or three) people getting it on and then bam: naked sex city! Nobody actually pays attention to what the porn stars are saying, not even the production companies, because nine times out of ten the video you are watching is free from any one of the known purveyors of this service. Same goes for this trash but rather than lasting about two or three minutes like with porn, it lasts close to forty minutes in the film.<br/><br/>E.L. James wants you to think Christian Grey is this sexual, magnetic and mesmerizing man. You'll have to take James's word for it because there is nothing that actually serves as proof in the Fifty Shades of Grey movie. There is more chemistry between Christian Grey and his suit than with Anastasia Steele. For a film whose whole foundation relies upon the main characters' inherent and undeniable attraction, this is kind of a big deal. From the initial meet-cute, which is just contrived exposition, the rest of the film unravels as the series of far-fetched events that theoretically lead to this, I guess you could call it, relationship.<br/><br/>The character of Christian Grey is just your average billionaire playboy clich√É¬©, you know the type, the one that has his name on a building. Jamie Dornan's portrayal is equally uninspired and would've been more effective had it been done by a robot. For anything would have been an improvement to his emotionless and stiff performance. Dakota Johnson's version of Anastasia Steele is purely physical and devoid of feeling. She hunches her shoulders, drops her head and averts her eyes, but she doesn't inhabit the personality or character. Johnson does her best impression of acting, even desperately overacting at times to compensate for her co-star's inability to emote.<br/><br/>So the characters and plot suck, but surely a film about BDSM has to still be entertaining, right? Wrong. Fifty Shades of Grey is about as sexually adventurous and innovative as vanilla yogurt. The audience of the theater I was in was in a fit of giggles because it is so dreadful it is cringe-worthy and awkward. This isn't BDSM, this isn't even kink or fetish, this is just sex: guy on top, holding your hands up above your head sex.<br/><br/>Friends, family, generous guests: I implore you not to waste your time or hard earned money on this garbage. There's more kink in a 4 minute pop song by Rihanna than a 125 minute film based on source material stretching an unimaginable 500 pages, woof. The best thing about the film is the Crazy in Love remix by Beyonce.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for more full reviews of all the recent releases."

Jamie seemed dull maybe even dry at times but I took it more as him being intense and stand offish as he was supposed to be.

"Sophie_89","10","3","9","16 February 2015"," Decent film, ended up being basically like an unconventional romantic comedy, but then that's right up my street! (Contains spoilers!!!)
","I think people are being way too harsh giving this film such a low rating & saying it's terrible! It's not a fantastic film, it didn't blow me away, but it's by no means terrible either. I thought that for the most part it was a nice little romantic comedy, albeit with an unconventional twist! (When Christian's restraining Ana and spanking her!) The acting is good, at times it made me laugh, at times it was emotional & dramatic (which I thought the actors played very well), there was good chemistry between the characters including sexual and there were of course some very sexy scenes too! So basically like your stereotypical 15 rated romantic comedy but the BDSM pushed it up to an 18.<br/><br/>I thought the film was similar in some ways to the first Twilight film & I know the author was inspired by Twilight to write Fifty Shades. For example, Christian not being able to stay away from Ana even though he thinks he should, but at the same time caring very much for her & wanting to protect her, very similar to Edward and Bella at the start of their relationship! I was a bit disappointed that a lot of the book was cut out & I think they changed some little bits too, I can't remember, I did read the books about 2-3 years ago now! But obviously it's necessary to cut bits out in order to make a 2 hour film and the film is still the same storyline as the book just condensed down to the important bits.<br/><br/>Some people will moan that there's not enough sex in it and some people will say there's too much. You can't meet everyone's tastes and if you want more sex then watch a porno because this film is not a porno! There is an actual storyline behind it, the character's backgrounds & a love story which I am more interested in & the sex is just a part of that. I will definitely buy it on DVD when it comes out. It will no doubt become a bit of a guilty pleasure for me! It's one of those films I'll end up watching time and time again when I want to and have got the time to snuggle up under the covers in my PJ's with a box of chocolates and watch a film with a great love story and a bit of man candy in it!"

Given my current age, that's some 14 years of experience. Being quite active in the kink scene, my girlfriend and many of our friends are into BDSM/bondage/kink as well. As the 50 shades hype has been an active topic of discussion in the kink scene, we were of course very interested in seeing it. And to be honest.. we were kind of counting on it to be a disaster of a movie :-P But.... it wasn't! Not at all! And we weren't the only ones who liked it. Many of our kinkster friends seemed to like it very much! Sure, they are fictional characters and it's just a movie, but most of it is not unrealistic at all. The toys, whips, techniques and atmosphere... Wow! The makers seemed to have done their research! Trust us, a BDSM session can be (and often is) very close to what you'll see in the movie.<br/><br/>So no flaws at all on the BDSM part? Yes, some.<br/><br/>Personally, I thought the contract he wants her to sign was a bit much. Someone with even a little experience would never be so pushy on that part. That doesn't mean that such a contract in itself is unrealistic. It's just more of a consensual thing... like getting married I suppose. You wouldn't propose to someone after knowing them for a few weeks, as that rarely ends well ;-) Referring to the last few minutes of the movie: We personally would always avoid practicing BDSM while being stressed out, emotional or unhappy in some way. Honesty, that's just asking for trouble. If Mr Grey was as experienced as we are led to believe, he would have sat down and talked to her about his feelings, rather than risking her being turned off and disgusted after a serious beating.<br/><br/>But that's basically all we could find. What remained (at least for us) is a fairly good and for the most part realistic movie with some verrrry sexy BDSM scenes! So if you're interested in what this movie is about, just go to a theater and watch it! Sure, it's certainly possible that most or all of the kinky scenes in this movie will turn you off. In that case, BDSM might not be for you. Of course, that's totally okay too! Just remember that bashing this movie just because you think BDSM is some form of abuse is very offensive to the people who truly enjoy it.<br/><br/>However (and this is the good part!) if even some of it does spark your interest, both me and my girlfriend are happy to inform you that it's perfectly possible to have a 100% equal, happy and lasting relationship and still practice the type of BDSM you'll see in 50 shades of Grey :-) Have fun exploring!"

","I went to watch Fifty shades last night with my boyfriend for Valentines day, and I have to say I'm confused as to why some reviews are extremely harsh! I have read all three books and yes I enjoyed them. Why?<br/><br/>Because it was something I had never read before, I study English at University so yes, I am a big romancer (I suppose just like Ana) and this story isn't based on romance. Yes it has a romance curve but that isn't the plot and the basis of it. Christian suffered from a horrific childhood and is a Sadist who enjoys sexual exploitation with women (these women aka submissives are all consent with this aka the contract). Also- what's the issue with the ending guys? It ends on a cliff hanger basis- so what???? That's how the first book ends??? <br/><br/>I thought the beginning of the film was good as it indicated how opposite they are however it did leave certain things out which i wasn't impressed with but no doubt them scenes were cut! <br/><br/>I do think the music played a big part in this film though. The songs were great choices and were fitting for the scene, and did play a big part in making the film better. However I do think the acting was pretty fine. I mean, I remember reading the book and picturing the interview in his office and how awkward and shy Ana would be and I think she portrayed that well throughout the film and gaining more confidence as well. Jamie Doman wasn't my first choice for this role however he did an okay job, it did seem at times like he was losing his American accent but, hey he tried. <br/><br/>Overall I think people should cut it some slack, yeah it wasn't the greatest film ever made, but I do think it portrayed the book well (minus the sex part I think that was a little poor) but I enjoyed it for the most part."

","I had zero expectations, before watching it, based on all the shitty reviews.<br/><br/>Dakota Johnson is actually pretty with a very nice body. And I enjoyed seeing her naked alot. <br/><br/>Since it's not possible to give zero stars on imdb anyway, that one star goes to her body. <br/><br/>The acting is not as horrible as I expected. But certainly not impressive either. <br/><br/>There is chemistry between the two leads. Why people say there isnt any, I dont know. <br/><br/>The movie is not PG13 either as I expected it to be. <br/><br/>Having finally seen Fifty shits of crap, I can understand why women enjoy this. As a man however I was pretty bored.<br/><br/>Why Anastasia put up with Christians behaviour and the way he treats her, his BDSM-needs and pretty much everything else is hard to believe.<br/><br/>Anastasia being a virgin, when meeting Christian (even though she's an american) is also hard to believe. Her not knowing what butt plugs are and appearently having never watched porn either, is also unbelievable.<br/><br/>Those scenes where he gets mad about her visiting her parents and actually follows her there, would have made any sane woman break up with him. Just as the ridicoulus contract as well as him saying he will pretend to be her boyfriend one night per week. What the hell is his problem?? <br/><br/>Yeah, yeah Ive read about his troubled childhood and the woman who had him as a BDSM slave for 6 years. But that does not justify Christian being a complete asshole to Anastasia. <br/><br/>Why women would be turned on by someone treating ther that way, I have no idea. <br/><br/>But Anastasia does put up with it. Untill the very end of the movie anyway. Where he whips her ass cheecks six times and she suddenly has had enough and leaves him. <br/><br/>She puts up with his dominant abusive attitude during the entire film, but him whipping her is appearently too much?? 
 
Avoid this unless youre a dumb middle aged housewife, that finds this more interesting than actual porn. <br/><br/>No men should ever watch it. Not even to please their girlfriends or wifes."
"laurabcharleston","10","2","5","20 April 2017"," Wish I had seen it in the theaters
","How anyone could not like this film is beyond me.<br/><br/>The acting from both leads was superb and on point. The chemistry was ridiculously awesome, evident, and ongoing. The music was phenomenal. The cinematography was amazing. The wardrobe was perfectly fitting and proper. This film left me wanting more, wanting to see it again and again and of course, in total awe of Mr. Grey in all his conquests. Johnson is a gem and Dornan is everything a girl could ever want in a man who hides his feelings well while offering safety, protection, and all the ultimate pleasures the body can handle.<br/><br/>Although this film portrays a different lifestyle from many, there is truly an underlying romance that shines brighter throughout the film, beyond lust, desire, pleasure, pain, and control. They fall in love and the passion is overwhelming.<br/><br/>I look forward to watching it over and over again and every sequel thereafter, forever. This film is warranted in this decade, could not have been better, and leaves you wanting more in the best way possible. Watch it with an open mind, open heart, and pay close attention to the body language of the leads. It will draw you in!"
"MovieMermaid","8","2","5","17 April 2016"," Makes you think about relationships and sex life
","I feel reviews of this movie have been too unfair. I feel it is a flock , sheep, heard effect. Yes there are a few things that aren't great about the film but the feeling is what is most important to me.<br/><br/>That being said, I will start by a few annoyances I found as I watched the movie. I think Dakota is an excellent actress when it comes to displaying emotions. She works really well with her eyes and you can see her energy coming out of her entire body when she is living that part. Her acting is a 9 out of 10. Apart from the forced awkward constant biting of the lip - which you could tell she has been ordered so many times by the director to do it and there was poor directing decisions as to how long one should have the frame on her lip, I mean, I feel it was not even her fault . i feel poor directing in this specific instance. Other than this, this is something that gets men excited.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed her interpretation, it kept me on the edge of my seat. She was very convincing as a young girl, hot for this successful confident guy, and this man is someone who finally turns her on enough to drive her crazy but not too crazy because she is quite lucid about the whole thing because now speaking of the character... she is a smart girl who thinks with her own mind and doesn't allow him to boss her around. <br/><br/>From what I can see people who rate this so badly are either people who want the same old love story and don't understand psychological nuances and just expect the same kind of movie. People need to start opening up to different kinds of plots.<br/><br/>For me, having been married for 8 years, this was about reconnecting to my sexuality that has been somewhat lost. I don't mean the props are needed but there is something everyone can get out of this.<br/><br/>The actor does portray this kind of man well. yes he seems cold but has inner turmoils going on inside him. Just because his demeanor is cold doesn't mean he is incapable of feeling. And so many people are like that.<br/><br/>It seems like a lot of people are narrow minded and have no idea of the diversity and a lot of people will feel ashamed to say they got thrills from this movie. I did. It is nothing to be ashamed of. Certain parts turned me on and I am not sade or masochist but there were parts that were very hot indeed. There was one moment in the very end that was a little more aggressive and this was just her decision to go beyond her boundaries.<br/><br/>A very valid movie. I was engaged the whole time and it explores many depths of the human psyche. <br/><br/>there was a lot of chemistry between the two actors. just feel the directing and the cuts editing timings could have been better. poor directing and editing can ruin an actors work. <br/><br/>I didn't watch the movie immediately when it came out because I didn't read the book and I wasn't eager to watch a whole lot of sex scenes. But it came up on TV one day and I gave it a chance despite all the negative reviews. I am glad I did because it shifted things around in me. Maybe not enough to make me want to pursue that kind of sexual life or relationship model but enough to make me spice up my own sexual life.<br/><br/>This actress is very sexy as a woman I can see that and she did a great part. She was perfect for the part and so was he. She is that kind of not striking gorgeous obvious beauty but has so much intensity in her eyes you can actually see the burn inside her, the desire is burning her up inside and he who is always in control almost looses control and actually looses control. I felt they were actually hot for each other for real.<br/><br/>Well done to these two actors."

","It's inevitable to mention that ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is one of the best films of 2015. It was not as painful as everyone thought. <br/><br/>Undoubtedly ""Jurassic World"" , ""Star Wars"" , ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and ""Furious 7"" marked path at the box office and critical overall but this year ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" boosted by its Valentine's Day release, have been record-breaking. <br/><br/>Globally, this film has attracted attention for the exciting and strange love story between English Literature student Anastasia Steele and billionaire businessman Christian Grey. <br/><br/>The erotic trilogy of books left speechless the whole world and the film was not far behind, Its quality to capture every detail of the book in real life was more attractive to attract the attention of fans and non-fans. <br/><br/>Dakota Johnson, daughter of actors Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, she was pleased to execute the Anastasia Steele character, She has done it a perfect way , showing virginity , innocence and sweetness of a woman who had never been in love, she was about to graduate, had the pressure of final exams, had to Jose hounding her and was about to go to a world full of dangers, alone. <br/><br/>Jamie Dornan, after playing a serial murderer in BBC Two -The Fall, comes as a replacement of the first elected Charlie Hunnam . The question is : Would have done much better Charlie as Christian ? I doubt it.Jamie made ‚Äã‚Äãan arduous and difficult work , fully achieve the character and that was evident. <br/><br/>Significantly, relationship Anastasia - Christian was moderate and closely linked to aspects of the bestseller but the relationship Dakota - Jamie has fuelled speculation that the two stars can barely stand each other's company. So Taylor - Johnson responded openly: "" The film's biggest single asset is Dakota Johnson: gone is the book's blithering simpleton "" <br/><br/>Interestingly , despite controversy between Sam and James , low public confidence in this project , the low apparent affinity between the main characters and the difficulty of bringing to the screen a book that revolutionized the world ,""Fifty Shades of Grey"" achievement to be one of the best films of 2015 , so Fifty Shades Darker ( 2017 ) will not have an easy road because Sam will not direct the sequel, James Foley who will be in the director's chair. <br/><br/>The film's single biggest asset is Johnson, who has worked hard with Marcel and Taylor-Johnson to perform a three-woman salvage job on the character of Anastasia. Gone is the book's blithering simpleton, with her arsenal of ""holy hell""s and ""double crap""s and ""oh my""s. Her inner goddess is, thank goodness, nowhere to be found or heard. She is at no point a quivering, moist mess, and doesn't make the ruinous error of thinking the word ""f___"" is an epithet. <br/><br/>Grey, for obvious reasons, is much more likely to Anastasia for intimacy and mystery with which it has on the books. <br/><br/>Personally , this film from start to finish was excellent , showing an introduction of a fairy tale , a totally aggressive and an end that surprised us . E. L .James' books are enigmatically catchers for the public but the film is undoubtedly the best of the best. <br/><br/>The sex scenes are intense thermometer , which threatens to get red hot but not reach the top,and with more participation Dakota that what Jamie. You could say that the submissive from all angles captured is about to undress while the master is not sufficiently dominant achieving momentarily deflect the camera toward her. Even when Grey, with his riding crops and cat-o'-nine-tails and Red Room of Pain, would claim otherwise, these sequences stay well within the bounds of vanilla mainstream taste. <br/><br/>Anastasia is no walkover here and sometimes gives as good as she gets, if not better. The funniest scene ‚Äì debatably the sexiest, too ‚Äì has the duo sitting at either end of a glass boardroom table, while Ana whips through the contract for their experimental relationship scratching out everything she won't consent to. The script isn't afraid to call a spade a spade here: ""Find anal fisting. Strike it out."" <br/><br/>It's amazing boom that had the soundtrack of the movie taking on its lists Ellie Goulding , The Weeknd , Sia, among others. Music is a quiet and elegant journey that distorts good way every erotic moment of the film, making them much more tolerable to hear groans and hits constantly . <br/><br/>The punishment of the inner goddess is very worrying and surprising , and the pain she feels , makes us mourn everyone . ""One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six"". <br/><br/>The end of the movie is the best, leaving an open end and shaking us all with a simple "" No"". (This ending is much better than the book) <br/><br/>There are no more words to praise the project, ""Sex, love, drama , romance , controversy , music , fame , pen and other things around to ""Fifty Shades of Grey"""

","Why? Really, the book was bad enough but to make this into a movie, to show this to people and call it sexy when really it's offensive, stereotypical, damaging, sexist, and encouraging for rape culture? This is not BDSM. This is not safe, consenting or good s3x. This is Hollywood, once again, getting something wrong and thinking it's okay because shock value will make them money. But this has repercussions. People may watch this, because it targets people who are not knowledgeable, and may try to reenact this and call it a scene. This is dangerous and someone could get hurt, or wind up in an abusive relationship because it is show as okay in the film."

"pivic","1","2","5","6 July 2015"," Horrid, vapid, sad bleed-out of a tale
","Actually, I will start off my review by quoting Anthony Lane's review of this film:<br/><br/>""Mostly, he sounds like your basic stalker: ""I'm incapable of leaving you alone,"" he informs Ana‚Äîa notion that appears to stimulate her, although it would easily warrant a call to 911. She succumbs, up to a point, but her recurring doubts lead Christian to dish up one of those crusty old no-means-yes propositions which feminism has battled for decades: ""You want to leave? Your body tells me something different."" Pass the butt plug.""<br/><br/>Indeed. This film is tragic, in a variety of ways, and sexy in none (for me, at least). And probably for a bunch of other people as well, as this film has marked 4.2/10 on IMDb, which is remarkably low. Still, I give this film 1/10 for a variety of reasons.<br/><br/>The characters are one-dimensional. The main character is ""god"" and, because of the book, is never-smiling and drab. I mean, if he'd only have been interesting in some way! He comes across all Bruce Wayne- y, body sculpted, can do everything (fly a helicopter, play the piano, own at least 75 different neckties), but lacks everything that he should have. Compare this with the lead character in Steve McQueen's ""Shame"": he says very little, but exudes so much, much more than this film collectively ever will.<br/><br/>The female lead character is just an object, nothing more. A boring, self-deprecating object with a touch of defiance, only there to display her as an individual, somebody who doesn't let anything happen to her as she's master of her own will.<br/><br/>Still, pap like ""I'm incapable of leaving you alone"" creeps me the hell out, it is _not_ sexy or passionate. It's cheap. And cheapens a lot of things. A lot of people who actually do enjoy BDSM have raised their voices against this film as it's apparently against what is considered safe BDSM use, and goes against more than that.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is a safe word in this film; down-watered covers, mainly used to be ""sultry"" and ""sensual"", no doubt, but are, in fact, like adding poop to your champagne. Not that this film is champagne in any way, shape or form; champagne is palatable. This film is not.<br/><br/>Avoid. There will be sequels. I'll avoid those."

","I will say that the extent of my knowledge of this movie was limited to what you would probably read on the back of the book. Rich guy+innocent girl+a little bondage. I have not read the book, so I am trying to review the movie alone, and not attack the over all story which I found wildly unbelievable. Dakota Johnson is wooden; even her mannerisms seem calculated and practiced. She is a cute girl, but she and Jamie Dornan have nooooooooo chemistry. He is a handsome guy, but seems so incredibly miscast. Even as he is trying to be this strong domineering type, he almost seems uncomfortable with what he is saying. (And I can't say that I blame him). I found certain scenes very jarring and uncomfortable (the whip scene??) and his character just seemed controlling and stalkerish. <br/><br/>There are some sexy encounters in the movie but all in all, I found myself wishing Charlie Hunnam had not have dropped out, and that they made Christian a little more like able.<br/><br/>Side note: I saw JD in an interview and he was very nice and humble. And that Irish accent ain't half bad! Here's hoping this movie doesn't ruin his budding career."

","This movie is easy to take apart. It seems to try to steer away from some of the ridiculous things the book included (from what I have read in reviews and other things, because I haven't read it, I think watching the movie was ""enough""). Still as many have observed there is no chemistry here between the leads. On one hand it's nice to see ""romantic"" movie steer away from certain things, on the other hand, it just a shallow diversion, that actually isn't one.<br/><br/>You get the same things (read clich√©s) that you get in your plain romantic comedy. Just without the comedy! Which is a factor that is sorely missed here. No matter how bad those were, you at least had some funny scenes here and there. The funny things here consist of stroking (which is supposed to be hitting?). And while it's nice to see a powerful female character, the transition of ""plain Jane"" to super woman/healer/confident character does not bode well.<br/><br/>Obviously there is a lot of nudity, a lot of longing looks and a lot of dialog that will make you cringe and (maybe even) whine at times. It still isn't as bad as expected, but that's not saying very much. The ""helping"" a ""poor"" soul excuse is also a masquerade that is as awful as it sounds. Obviously only works with attractive people (which goes both ways no matter the gender)"
"natashabowiepinky","4","2","5","7 June 2015"," Fifty Shades Of 'Meh'
","Fifty Shades of Grey is a very silly film, based on an over-hyped book, in which an incredibly attractive young billionaire decides to initialise a clumsy young girl into his world of sado-masochistic sex when she turns up one day to interview him.<br/><br/>Aside from a few notably graphic scenes involving blindfolds, restraints and whips, their is virtually nothing here to distinguish this bromidic mush from the thousands of others tales of it's ilk... From the chiselled hunk with the 'tortured' past, to the flighty heroine, who one minute is all for this guy's weird fetishes, and the next (for no particular reason) decides to back away.<br/><br/>In other words, don't expect an in-depth psychological profile... Christian Grey is a d*ck simply because he had some unfortunate experiences at the hands of an older woman in his youth (which aren't really elaborated on) and the brilliantly named Anastasia Steele wants true love in her life... She doesn't like it when Grey forces her into a more casual relationship. Still, at least he gives her a nice car. She should be a bit more grateful, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Most of the film proceeds like this, with Grey popping up where Steele least expects him to, trying to 'get it on' with her at every possible moment, and Steele umming and arring over whether to sign a contract, which would turn her into Grey's personal plaything for months. In other words, she'd be selling HERSELF into slavery. But, hey... a slave with a nice car. Love that car.<br/><br/>The attempts at drama fall as flat as the Rolo I sat on last night, the non-stop brooding by both leads becomes very irritating very quickly, and the always present pop songs in the background make you want to listen to the soundtrack, rather than suffer through the rest of this soporific slop. You know the one... ""I let you set the pace... Cos I'm not thinking ssttrraaiigghhtt"". Damn you Elle. And Damn this movie. 4/10"
"maykennon-64639","1","2","5","14 May 2015"," Just Horrible
","They're no words to describe this mess. It's just horrible and I've read the first book because my friend told me to and I found the book completely ridiculous. <br/><br/>1. These two have no chemistry. The romance sucks because they never talk about each other hardly. Ana is just some girl with a pretty face and that's all. Christian was adopted and had issues which is it. Which doesn't help their pathetic acting. I'm sure in different roles they could do fine but with the writing they make Kristen Stewart look like Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>2. The story does revolve around the Dom/Sub genre. Honestly it was pretty bad. When we see his room with all of his toys you would expect there to be lots of BDSM. However the most we get is spanking and tying up. That's it. Even the most 'interesting' moments in book were cut out from this movie. Fans and general audiences thought it was a terrible pathetic way after all this build up.<br/><br/>3. The characters are awful. I mentioned before that we hardly know anything about them and that's the problem with this movie. They hardly have any connection and they just want to have sex together and that's it. Plus they're not relatable in anyway. Christian is a creepy stalker who keeps forcing Ana to do stuff that makes her uncomfortable. How are we supposed to get behind on this guy? Ana is just so unintelligent and keeps running back to this guy for no good reason. Then of course she tells him that she loves him when he clearly keeps saying I don't do love and that upsets her. Why were you so surprised? He told you millions of times! Everyone else is forgettable and uninteresting.<br/><br/>The book was bad and this movie was even worse. This is pure Twilight fan-fiction and you can tell from both the book and the movie. Even people who do BDSM didn't like this movie because it didn't depict them well.(I don't do BDSM but there was an article about users who do) This movie didn't do anything right except the nice scenery and that's it.<br/><br/>Sorry fans of the book and movie but this is one movie that shouldn't have been made."

In terms of conversations, it had as many lines as a Van Damme movie. She seems scared and about to cry most of the time, while he looks stupid and says things that make you think he's reciting from a different script. The sex scenes are really weak, there is no tension between the 2; the story and the characters don't seem to evolve naturally, rather the whole action seems fake and awkward. If you have not seen the movie yet, do not bother! I guess lots of people have seen this first part out of curiosity, but after their disappointment, I believe the next 2 films will play with empty cinemas."

","It seems many have a problem with this movie but I found it amusing and pretty light hearted considering its supposed 'seriousness'.<br/><br/>I found many reasons why it has no chance to be accepted these days.<br/><br/>The fact that the main male character was white, strong and not defeated by anyone must concern a lot of you. Also there were no gay characters in this movie. Even worse, the lead character appeared a bit disgusted when he was asked if he was gay. The straight white woman is supposed to defeat this rogue and date the Hispanic guy, right? No, in fact he was told to back off by Grey. Did you feel that was racist? I'll bet many of you did. Watching a white woman have sex with a white man must have been disturbing to many of the viewers! This movie violates everything you have been told relentlessly by the mainstream media for many years. You should feel uncomfortable.<br/><br/>If you think I am wrong, make Christian black and the girl's friend a lesbian. I am sure your hatred for the movie would be mitigated whether you liked the plot or not."

","Watched it out of morbid curiosity.....and want that 2 hours and 5 minutes of my life back!<br/><br/>Routine sex, typical routine relationships get boring...I get it. Role playing and bondage can be fun for some with that acquired taste. But this movie was just weak, wack and a waste of time.<br/><br/>****Contains Spoilers******<br/><br/>Hollywood hasn't had an original thought in DECADES! I felt like this movie reeked of stolen scenes themes from other movies like Twighlight...the sexual Tension between Edward and Bella and how he could have basically killed her trying to have sex with her. Him being so powerful and her being so demure and frail.<br/><br/>Pretty Woman the scene when after they have sex, Richard Gere's character is playing the piano and Julia Roberts shows up in a bed sheet and they have sex at the piano. Richard Gere is a powerful business tycoon, who can't be bothered in a typical relationship though he is the most eligible bachelor in town.<br/><br/>I thought this would be about a naive young inexperienced girl meeting a guy who turned her out sexually. Not some twisted detached guy who really wants a woman to be willing to consent to being beaten then screwed, as per the contract.<br/><br/>The movie was just plain stupid in my opinion. I understand the concept behind sexual dominance and submission, at the core of it men are usually dominant in pursuing women and eventually and hopefully conscentually a woman consents or submits willing to a man. But dominance and submission roles can be reversed in this type of sexually fetish fantasy where the woman is the dominant and the man is the submissive. It can go both ways.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what this movie was trying to accomplish. It was never clear. I kept waiting for it to get better and it just fell flat and abruptly ended. With the feeling that there would be a series of sequels to it like Twilight...which as cheesy and poorly directed and acted for some reason is a guilty pleasure of mine. I can't explain why, but I watched just about all of them out of morbid curiosity and could sit through them again if nothing else better was on TV, which I hardly watch anymore.<br/><br/>The book had to be a page turner like a muddafukkah but this would be another movie adaptation that went all wrong when trying to translate from paperback to the big screen. The characters were not developed, their chemistry was not there and it was painfully awkward, and there was no reason for Ana to have fallen in love with someone like Christian, he never talked to her or confided in her about anything. The only thing I ever recall him telling her about himself was when she was sound asleep.<br/><br/>Watching paint dry would be more interesting than this"

","The only redeeming thing about this movie was the soundtrack! And as good as this soundtrack was, the acting should have been better. How the heck are you going to award crappy acting with a good soundtrack? You know I never read the Twilight books before I saw the movies and I'm glad it went that way. But this on the other hand. I thought I could read the book and work my way to seeing the movie but it didn't work out that way. I got bored ten and a half chapters in and returned it for a refund but I wanted to like this.....franchise? So I watched the movie online- yes you can find it online and not waste money seeing it-<br/><br/>I made a mistake even reading the first half of the book! It's like that book was their script! But at the same time they tried way too hard that it just fell flat. Like how Ana suddenly tripped through the door. And then during the whole interview process with Christian we are suppose to believe there is instant chemistry there? Well it was lost on me because with anyone she interacted with she seemed lost and confused. And she said um a lot.<br/><br/>Then the club scene in the bathroom line she tried to act drunk but just looked stupid and stung out on something. The vomiting scene happened to fast and the scene where she almost got hit by a cyclist. It's like with certain scenes in the book they wanted to focus on those but at the same time just brush over them. I'm surprised they didn't add the tampon and blow job scene in it. Or would that have been too much?<br/><br/>If the doe-eyed, lost girl look is what they were going for then they picked a damn good actress for Ana. But Christian on the other hand. No! I'm sorry Jamie but no! You are not Christian Grey.He didn't stand out at all! Whether he was in a suit or regular clothes, he just looked like an everyday guy! There was nothing billionaire about him and that's sad.<br/><br/>And this whole you need to sign the contract but I'm going to call you my girlfriend anyways and continue to have sex with you for a hundred and twenty eight minutes is ridiculous! The erotic scenes were great! At first then it seemed to die down to boring!<br/><br/>And then of course the infamous ending of the spanking of Ana six times. Oh my gosh! Why was she crying like she got her feelings hurt on the playground? Get it? Playground?<br/><br/>He hit her once and waited like ten seconds for her to count each one it was ridiculous! Dominant nothing!<br/><br/>Great soundtrack though. However Love Me Like You Do should not have been played during the first helicopter ride."

","So I just saw Fifty Shades of Grey¬Ö in theaters¬Ö by myself¬Ö How has it come to this?<br/><br/>I believe that for this review, a bit of back story is in order. One day, while waiting for my plane at an airport in Dallas, I stumbled upon the much talked about erotic novel. I had some money to spare and bought it out of pure boredom. I sat down and read it for the next few days, and I kinda liked it. Fifty Shades is what I'd called an ""easy read."" Not a piece of literature to be examined or talked about. Just a nice piece of smut to pass the time while you're forced to read Hamlet in English class. I was actually kind of rooting for this film in a way, as a I felt that people were taking it too seriously as a film. It's simple porn, what's there to criticize?<br/><br/>However, as the reviews came in, the sirens went off in my head. With criticisms directed towards the acting and the characters and the writing, my expectation were hit. So I bought my ticket and just said to myself, ""Hey, if I'm not expecting much, then the film won't suck.""<br/><br/>So, I sat down in a theater with a bunch of chatty young women and all of the boyfriends wanted to kill themselves, and the movie started.<br/><br/>Well¬Ö I didn't HATE it.<br/><br/>So the major problem that I have with Fifty Shades of Grey is that it is boring. The scenes between the two main characters where they're just talking and interacting is just not interesting. You sit there waiting for the LEGENDARY sex scenes to come on, and even those aren't enough to carry the film! I know the BDSM scenes are shocking and new to most people, but the truth is, I'm not most people. And apparently, I wasn't alone because the guy sitting right next to me was just as bored as I was. I swear, we both yawned at the exact same time!<br/><br/>The directing doesn't stand out at all. The shots and angles were pretty stationary and standard, nothing exciting or new or interesting. I did like one shot were Christian was sitting at a piano as the Seattle skyline shined in the night.<br/><br/>Along with that, the acting was sub-par AT BEST. Nobody stands out. The whole time, I was just thinking, ""this actor is delivering their lines.""<br/><br/>The character of Anastasia Steele can only be described as a pushover.And other than that, she's also can be pretty indecisive. I mean, she spends the whole movie complaining about how Christian doesn't treat her like a normal girlfriend (even though he does) and how this BDSM business is too much for her (even though the film shows she clearly likes.)<br/><br/>Christian Grey is NOT an interesting character. He's merely a prop for female readers to grab on to. The purpose of him having a dark and lonely past, coupled by him being changed by Anastasia, is merely a female fantasy of taking a bad boy and trying to help him see ""love."" It's no brainer to me know how this evolved from Twilight fanfiction.<br/><br/>But yeah, with all of that said, Fifty Shades of Grey is simply a boring romance film with a minuscule glimmer into the world of BDSM. But when you see that speck of a new world in sex and fetishes, it's really not much to write home about."

"Videogamer595","2","2","5","29 April 2015"," 50 Shades Adaptation is Less than Stimulating
","50 Shades of Grey has become a household name in the recent years as the fastest selling paperback book ever. It's steamy premise and erotic content make it a favorite amongst the female community; its even been coined as ""mommy porn."" The book follows the story of Anastasia Steele, a 21 year old college student who is asked to intern for a Mr. Christian Grey, a wealthy, young entrepreneur who built a successful empire from the ground up. Anastasia and Christian develop a sexual relationship in which Anastasia is introduced into bondage, submission, and sadomasochism, or BDSM. While the book seems as if it was written by a high school teenager whose hormones have been running rampant, the movie borrows heavily from this horrible writing style and does an exact copy and paste. The 50 Shades movie adaptation spares no expense from the amateurish writing and Director Sam Taylor-Johnson converts the remedial writing into an amateur spectacle of less-than- appealing sex scenes, poor plot development, and an unrealistic and unappealing portrayal of the supposed mysterious and soft spoken Christian Grey. Taylor-Johnson spares no expense in developing the relationship of Grey and Steele, but cuts out a lot of the steaminess and important details that were explained in the book. While I did not happen to read the book in its entirety (what I did read was a complete mess), from others whom have read the book and seen the movie, the consensus has been generally negative. But, from someone that has seen the movie without reading the book, it leaves little to the imagination what could be left to see in the story from the book that the movie has left out. To be fair, the movie industry has a strict set of rules on sexual content in rated R movies, so the movie was pushing the limit to some degree but some people considered the sex scenes to be a ""sexual ad for Pottery Barn."" While the directing style was very amateurish, the writing seemed just as amateurish and the characters were not believable. Dakota Johnson, who plays Steele, was probably the only positive part of this God-awful film; her portrayal of na√Øve Anastasia Steele was well done. However, James Dornan's portrayal of Christian Grey seemed too weak and not as mysterious and ominous as Grey was portrayed in the book. All in all, the best parts of the film were the opening and ending credits. With that, I give 50 shades of Grey only one half star out of five stars."
"Arvo_Diri","1","2","5","29 April 2015"," How to make an unerotic erotic movie
","I watched this because I was advised to by... feminist women, who found it great.<br/><br/>OK, first the sex scenes. They are rare and short, but more particularly they give the impression of having been edited by a puritan committee, which is totally awkward, because contradicting the intention to show kink. They stink, not of BDSM violence, but of such a hypocritical mixture of peeping and decency.<br/><br/>Then, the emotional build-up maybe? Because that would differentiate a mainstream movie from cheap porn, right? Well, the male lead shows the emotions of a real estate agent walking a client through posh apartments, while all the time doubting that the client can pay. And as far as the fascinating virility goes, it turns out he has Mummy issues. The female lead displays the emotions of a girl visiting a new sports club. And eventually she decides she's not interested anyway. Good thing the director made her bite her lips a few times, so we can notice she felt some kind of fear. But her eyes looked totally uninterested throughout. The guy too.<br/><br/>In the meanwhile, you have to sit through a lot of seemingly irrelevant scenes. In that respect they have achieved the feat of making those scenes feel both extremely long and extremely rushed. You constantly wonder if you might have missed something, that would explain where is the dramatic tension. Or even why the characters are there.<br/><br/>So, basically, a very unpleasant movie. The real phenomenon is why it attracted such crowds. Surely the trailer made it appear hot, that accounts for the male audience presumably, so congrats to the producers for the tease of the decade. But what about those who declared it fascinating even after having watched it? Apparently, exclusively women.<br/><br/>Here people like me are left in the role of a chemist during an experiment, seeing that something happens, and concluding that there must be a chemical element that has not been detected yet. The only element that I can assume is that the guy is immensely rich.<br/><br/>To conclude, I would say that this is a success, not at all a failure. It achieved exactly what it was meant to achieve: lots of bucks.<br/><br/>It will give lots of women an opportunity to complain about domestic abuse. Then lots of men will reply that a relationship where the woman says yes all the time, then finally says no and walks out free, is not domestic abuse. And altogether it will make a lot of tickets sold."

","I just finished watching the movie. I have not read the books and will not cause I am more into watching the movie kind of person. I watched the movie out of curiosity.<br/><br/>I gave it 7 out of 10 for the type of movie that it is. I will not bother telling the story cause everyone knows it by now. But lets say it is about an ordinary young inexperienced girl who meets and falls in love with an older very much experienced man with unusual tastes in sex and unconventional notions of a what a romantic relationship should be, who is filthy rich.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of clich√©s, which are a part of life anyway. And we move on to the sex part. Sex is a human activity that is highly subjective. One can do whatever the hell they want with their partner as long as it is agreed upon by both parties. And also lets clear up that the parties are adults. Also, sex involves experimentation and exploring practices and techniques out of the ordinary. So, that is the dominant component of this film accompanied by the underlining matter of emotional attachment no matter what type of sex is involved. The young girl who is a virgin allows herself to be introduced in a more explicit, unusual kind of sex. It is not about abuse either physical or spiritual. The guy in the movie clearly seeks her consent before he does anything of what he has in mind. There is a CONTRACT specifically mentioning all that is involved. So there is not in any case taking advantage or forcing the girl into anything that she doesn't want to do.<br/><br/>Both characters have their everyday lives that have nothing to do with what they are getting into once they are behind closed doors in their own privacy. The guy is the dominant one, at this stage of his life at least, because when he was younger he was the submissive. So, the dominant and the submissive role has nothing to do with gender. It is absolutely irrelevant.<br/><br/>As far as the actors, Dornan at the beginning of the movie comes out quite uptight and rigid. He struggles throughout the film with his Irish accent but from a point on it becomes a minor matter. He is detached, for that is what his character is supposed to be anyway. He could have been better at it of course, but that is a matter of the director as well as the script writer. Johnson portrays the young inexperienced girl fairly OK. She is not supposed to be the sex bomb nor the sassy horny student. Her innocence and naivet√© is what catches Grey's attention. So far so good.<br/><br/>The directing and the dialog could have been better, but come on boys and girls this film wasn't meant for the Oscars!!! Also it is a part of a trilogy so there had to be things to be put into the following movies.<br/><br/>The music was good and fitting for the mood. Overall it was an easy watched movie with its pros and cons. If you start watching and expect a ""Dearhunter"" or a ""Sofie's choice"" or red hot porn you will definitely be disappointed.<br/><br/>To sum up, it is very much like the relationship and contract that Sheldon Cooper has with Amy Farrah Fowler but with sex...."
"siderite","5","2","5","11 April 2015"," I kept an open mind. My brain fell out.
","I really tried to see it from all angles. I forced myself to ignore the really weird dialogues, the uncontrollable female gasping at every touch of the guy, the impossibly longing looks shot to the girl or the fact that for any person I know, the behaviour of Grey would have really freaked them out (and I don't mean the sexual practices).<br/><br/>But after all that, I just couldn't believe how inconsistent the characters were. Any story has a first goal that absolutely must be achieved, and that is the suspension of disbelief. When the viewer cannot believe things like this can EVER happen (I mean, we believe magic and star ships are OK) then the movie fails. This film has failed.<br/><br/>I could not believe a twenty-something virgin can have the confidence necessary to wrap a hot charismatic experienced millionaire around her finger. I could not believe that a guy that needs to dominate women can be so weak and out of control. But worst of all, I could not believe the sex scenes.<br/><br/>I understand and acknowledge that women have their fantasies, but the one about the hot single rich stud, domineering and charismatic, who falls head over heels for the virginal girl, then ultimately either submits to her cultural perspective on a normal relationship or gives her the power to reject him is not only spooky, it is offensive.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Just like that joke about soft porn being hard porn at half the speed, this two hour long movie is a sort of softer soft porn, at a quarter of the speed. The fact that many critics praised the movie for being a lot better than the amateurishly written book makes female sensuality seem even more terrifying to me that it already was. And it was boring, people! So so boring!"
"ShudderMight-186-823352","5","2","5","8 April 2015"," An almost-satisfactory attempt ruined by painfully false-scripted dialogues and repetitive scenes.
","In screening Fifty Shades of Grey with no prior knowledge of the book whatsoever with the exception of its tag topic BDSM and the brief synopsis of a English literature student entering the world of Christian Grey, a sadist dominant pushing Anastasia Steele into the extremities of her imagination, one will require a mature attitude toward the idea of a fetish in order to view the film without bias. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, despite some of the scenes in which both leads could not save themselves from the fan-fictional language of the original book, entirely diminishing the built up dramatic tension, Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan does succeed in bringing their roles properly to life, especially Johnson who manages the on-screen transition from a virgin to woman which came as a surprise for me as her portrayal as Em in Date and Switch offered no significance. That being said, there are flaws, the all but gradual emotional growth and the rapid transition of her attitudes from playful naught to solemn anger and frustration against Grey was somewhat of a nuisance to audiences' eyes. <br/><br/>On the technical side of things, there were a few scenes in which sound mixing may come across as an over exaggeration, for example the helicopter scene which dramatically speaking was necessary however created no lasting impact but more of an annoyance as it pushes the story backwards when at that point, the script should have been pushed forward. <br/><br/>The progressive changes to the styling of Steele and also her roommate could be praised, depicting the sudden changes in Anastasia's life, and the never dismissed wardrobe of Grey, though expected, was done in a standard slightly above average. Another technical merit complimenting the characters was the makeup, as it was able to adjust between pre-sex and post-sex states of Anastasia, reflecting her inner emotions ranging from joy to fatigue to confusion to frustration. <br/><br/>To be frank, the directions given for the sex-scenes were done quite well as to create neither a complete soft core porno too embarrassing to watch in the crowd nor a total disaster unfaithful to the female readers of the original. Tastefully done neither Actor's genitals were fully exposed despite chances to do so, movements were subtle, camera works had been in a comfortable degree just between subtlety and explicitness. However both song selections almost completely ruins the atmosphere, offering not the expected hollowing beauty but more of a malice to the scenes. There were a lot less spanking involved as expected by the original readers what with most actions implied rather than shown, the only explicit scene was probably the ice-cube scene. And to tie the entirety together, Jamie Dornan's abs contrasting fragile flimsy body of Dakota seem to have done it for the audiences, One flaw, however was the excessive exaggeration of moaning, an 'immersive' mistake that could have been easily fixed and corrected by sound editing.<br/><br/>The progressive plot started off as entertaining, grabbing most audiences attention with low point jokes that usually doesn't run flat and keeps the story running, the humour supports the first half of the film nicely in compliment to the building up to the more serious parts. However in the second part as the movie loses its humorous supports, filled up with repetitive scenes and dialogues dragging the entire picture to 2 hours which looks much more serious as a drama but really is quite excessive when there's a trilogy planning to be made. The acting also drops off in the second half as Jamie Dornan, though successfully depicted the changes in his role from all controlling to almost tolerance, by toning down his sense of mystery, arrogance and air of danger to seem realistic on big screen, fails to bring the audiences home with the poker face when more expressions should have been seen. Which leaves mostly frustration and impatience for the audiences as they pray for the movie to end.<br/><br/>The ending appears all too drastic and sudden, which could be excused in a setup film in a large franchise for an ending of magnificence and epic, such as Mocking jay Part 1 or Harry Potter: The Deathly Hallows Part 1. However, as the introduction to the possible trilogy, the curtain falls way too soon conveying no cliffhanging and ruins the continuity of the story, as if the director herself had to be excused to the bathroom and her PA was forced finished the rest. <br/><br/>The overall plot seem to be headless as it does not rest on a focus, from Anastasia's struggle to normality to her curiosity in Grey to objectification of women to BDSM which intensifies the relationship of the leads to the said relationship being a fantasy of princess-in-a-tower. Which limps the movie to a dreadful two hours.<br/><br/>On an ending note, Fifty Shades of Grey offers almost competent technical support including makeup art direction to make it a visual film with decent casting, acting, and scripting and ultimately a controversial topic to lure audiences into its world, however fails to extract itself completely from the original Fan-fiction author therefore after the better half of enjoyable humour becomes a mind-boggling fest of none-happenings, leaving most audiences disappointed. <br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>Perfection 0/0.5<br/><br/>-Capable of sustaining through multiple viewing<br/><br/>-Deliver genre specific impact (high dramatic tension, emotional impact, stunt action) <br/><br/>-Satisfactory soundtrack<br/><br/>-Acceptably original plot containing originality even if the film itself is an adaptation<br/><br/>-Enjoyable as a standalone film even though it may be in a franchise. <br/><br/>Musical Composition/ Sound track 0.5/1.5<br/><br/>(Genre Specialties) Jokes, Drama, Sex 0.6/1.5<br/><br/>Makeup, Costume, hairstyle, Art direction 0.5/0.5 Combined as these are minor factors<br/><br/>Adapted Script 0.6/2 <br/><br/>Acting 0.9/1.5<br/><br/>Casting 0.4/0.5<br/><br/>Technical works (Visual editing, Sound editing/mixing, Cinematography) 0.2/0.5<br/><br/>Production Design1.3/1.5<br/><br/>Overall: 5/10"

It was relatively accurate to the book but I think more time could have been spent on character development and using overlays of thinking processes of Ana and Christian like in the book. I saw the R rated version so the nudity was no surprise! The scenes were watered down still compared to the book and there was no hint at the issues Christian has with being touched, it was just a mention of it towards the finish of the movie. I don't think they set it up all that well for the next movies/novels in the series as that is one of the main struggles with him. It is a major part of his character and was given a minor role. There wasn't much reason given to why he was adopted and I realise most of that discussion didn't come until the 2nd book but the depth of his character was alluded to in the first book. He just seemed like a shy boy with a fetish. Her character was also quite plain but again, overlay of her thoughts is needed to show how conflicted she is. In this movie she just looks straight away confident and willing whereas in the book you are taken through her mind where she is consistently conflicted and shy and fearful of his rejection but also struggling with knowing she is worth him. All in all I still enjoyed it because I enjoyed the book. Not as a quick porn book, but just a story about two people from different sides of the spectrum who come together in fateful circumstances."

","From a person who has read the books I am very disappointed to say that the movie was horrendous! First off, the story was not the greatest but I'm a sucker for a love story and I enjoyed that aspect of it although I did not like how the it ended. I enjoyed how the author described all her characters so well that it was easy to vividly picture what they should look like. So I knew the movie would suck when I saw the choice of actors; actresses chosen to play Ana and Kate are too old to play 21 year old girls. Christian was described with so much detail that I'm sure most female readers longed to be Ana. Christian is supposed to turn heads everywhere he goes, he is beyond handsome with a billionaire, bad boy, sorta cocky swag. The actor chosen doesn't fit the bill at all. He can't even say laters' babe and make it sound sexy, just sounds dumb. His penthouse is supposed to be white and sterile while not losing that rich feel, and where are Ana's chucks?! The music from the book was also detailed, where are the specific tiles used in the book. I know some things are changed when they make a movie based on a book but come on! This is barely the same story. I watched anyway just to see if the movie was well done but walked out just under an hour. Its so boring, lacking emotion, attraction, and story line that if I hadn't read the books I'd have no idea what the point of the movie was supposed to be. So if someone wanted to read the book or watch the movie, read, and never watch the movie."

Why did you pick him as Grey? He doesn't looks horny when there are sex scene. He doesn't look like bdsm lover. He looks weird especially in bathroom scene. Well actually Dakota looks weird. And guys, why don't you put his vital in the movie? I mean come on. Dakota showed her breast. And your purpose is to make the watchers horny right? And I'm sure if your purpose is to make a good movie with art, it wont be like this. This is a seriously trash. I mean it about this movie is a porn. Even my boyfriend watched this just the sex scenes. He said he don't wanna watch another scene because it was boring.

","This film is beyond me, it's beyond terrible so much so that it gives cinema a bad reputation. Me and a friend saw this in a half full screening of mainly women, us being the minority male viewers.<br/><br/>Firstly, how women can like this is shocking. There's blatantly no chemistry or expression of any intimacy between the two lead characters. There's nothing to suggest why any women would be even slightly aroused by the behaviour of this poorly written ""dominant"". It's almost as if you just presume they didn't actually like each other in any way, outside of the role.That being said,and it being so obvious, this film is degrading to women everywhere. The book must be too. If I presented a contract that suggested I sexually abused you via things like whips, sex toys and fisting you, I would expect you to run a mile or 60. The fact that he can do this (in film and book) and people found it arousing is pathetic. E.L James has degraded women everywhere, she's literally wrote something that dumps every morale standing women have, everything about Mr.Grey's behaviour is stereotypically slating the standards of females. By her writing, it's fine to treat women poorly if you have a ton of money, you've got a great body and like to exert the power you have to belittle women. Also, you like to intimidate them to a point where they can't speak, invade their lives like a stalker and force yourself into everything they do as if you were a spot on their face, just when they wanted to look flawless.<br/><br/>I've never noticed poor choreography in a film, this film opened my eyes to how not to get actors/actresses to move on screen. It's awkward. The characters emotions are completely backward, there are points where the audience thinks she should do one thing, she does the opposite. Then its vice versa next scene.<br/><br/>Don't waste you're time watching this generic, forcefully made, un-erotic, poorly written, terribly directed, miss- cast leads and emotionally redundant garbage."

","For all those who hate the movie because it isn't as detailed as the book.. NO SH*T. never is. You all like the smutty sexiness of the badly written book, with no story, so when the lack of story and edited sex scenes got made, just like half of you claimed the book was all about, you got pissy. Talk about hitting the head on the nail! ;) Personally I didn't favor the book I'm an avid reader and I think this simply wasn't the greatest, however the movie although was rushed I liked. The girl character actually seemed less bland on scene then she did in the book. Other then that all the funny parts that make him seem like less of a controlling as* are there and most of the defining details in their relationship. I wouldn't have picked some of those characters but Overall they did a pretty good job."

","The movie 50 sheds of Grey is type of the movie where writer tries to demonstrate specific type of man. In this case man who is narcissus. The movie is presented in way that he is main actor and Ana is just accompany for the movie. There is no romance in the movie, which would be illusion that we get as a great acting of Grey. Grey remains me a lot of movie ""American pshyco"" where we can see full projection of the character and his way of life. I would say that Catherine Hardwicke failed to interpret the character personality in such a way as Brad Anderson did. I will give short explanation of the movie (Spoilers alert): Grey is a person who like challenges, always looking for opportunities. He lives his life without emotions. His emptiness is hard to fulfill, only thing that makes him feel something is sadism. I have to mention again that director FAILES to interpret the character since he doesn't give emphasize on his arrogance, egocentrism and unhappiness, rather gives importance to the ""romantic"" relation between Ana and Grey. (Turned out to be complete fail) Ana is a collage girl with no experience in sex and life, she is pretty much just a regular citizen. Anyhow she challenges Grey by saying that she thinks that he doesn't have friends and biting her lips. She is convinced that all of that is just a game and that she can handle it. She like him a lot, and so innocent she fall in love with him. Thinking of prince charming¬Ö Whole movie is focused in their relation, but without clear explanation of the characters we can only guess movie from personal perspective. FINAL Explanation: On the end most of the people were expecting more, but in reality it was easy to predict how things are going to finish. Honestly I thought that he will do much wielder stuff to her then spank her with belt 6 times. (maybe it was fear of public that made director change his mind, we will never know that.) Also we can trust Grey that after 15 times trying his contract with different girls he never let anyone so near. Could be, however we don't know how close he was with them. My guess is that on the end he liked her, since she never used secret word. Clearly he doesn't feel anything at all for her (he was buying her all the time, and mentally preparing her for the contract). I don't blame people not seeing that since last 20 minutes of movie was terribly interpreted, and there are too many holes in the movie that doesn't give you chance of seeing whole picture. <br/><br/>Bottom line, Grey lives his life by his rules and we can see him thriving through the world. I don't think that anything will stop his way of life. It doesn't matter if they continue or not. The relationship will always have expiration date. The MAIN point is taking look of his lifestyle and his rules. On the end she is the only one who got hurt."
"LarsHell","8","2","5","2 March 2015"," I can relate to this...
","Yes, this movie has a glossy and even surface. But beneath that exquisite surface, even beneath that delicate pains i found two likable characters i can really relate to. Christian is a kind of ""damaged good"", the things that happened to him at an early age minted him on those certain attractions and corrupted him. forever. And Anastasia is so much more understandable and likable. I know virgins that are much more older than her, waiting for Mr.Right. I even held my breath as she decides to succumb to the desires of Christian - which could not be a surprise, even if i did not read the books. The open ending left me puzzled and sad. This film made me much more thinking about myself, than any other movie since ""Mullholland Drive"". It is sexy! surprisingly sexy, because i'm a gay man. Yes, its has cheesy dialogue, but it is not awful, soulless or dull. The Soundtrack is terrific and ""Love Me Like You Do"" is one kind of catchy tune."

","I recently finished the whole ""Fifty Shades"" series and to say the least I was excited.

I'm not going to go into details of every scene because that would be pointless, go see the movie.<br/><br/>I feel like they did a great job with the character development. Both Jamie and Dakota did an excellent job brining these fictional characters alive on the big screen. Though I think they could of focused more on capturing the change of Christians character more, so the audience would have a better understanding of him and his progression throughout the movie. I say that reading the book It gave me more insight to the true story, it would have been difficult understanding it fully if I hadn't read the book before hand.<br/><br/>I have to give it every member of the cast and crew for transforming this book into a 2 hour movie. There was a lot of things in the book that weren't in the movie, and how incredibly difficult it must have been to pick and choose what important scenes to keep and what so not important scenes to drop. <br/><br/>Overall I was satisfied and am looking forward to the next 2 installments in the Fifty Shades Trilogy."

","i watched 50 shades of grey. my take on it follows. and there be might be a bit of a spoiler in here..sorry..<br/><br/>never read the book. enjoyed the movie. the acting..was really quite good. subtle even. there are a few issues i must make with the film though. <br/><br/>1. they really didn't show the BDSM crowd in the best light. the best Dom's i ever met? never had to raise their voice nor their hand. because their presence, how they carried themselves, made me want to do as they asked. of course i'm not into pain so i'd never go for that type of Dom anyway. the point is, that NOT all Doms are sadists and not all sadists are Dominant. they really should have cleared that up better. <br/><br/>my 2nd point and more important to me is that a grown woman, according to the dialogue of the movie itself, in essence raped and made a sex slave of a 15 yr old boy until he was 19 yrs old. that she, KNOWING his past with his mother and the abuses he suffered? then what that friend of Christian's mother did to him for YEARS, was RAPE & enslavement.<br/><br/>between his birth mothers abuses and what that adult woman did to him? MADE him as twisted as he was. and further, he believed he was incapable of being able to love and when it was presented to him? he didn't know how to handle it. to him the abuse was love. and thats the saddest thing of all. <br/><br/>maybe i'm able to more ""abandon all logic and reality ye who enter here"" when watching movies, i thought it was OK. i REALLY do think the acting was PRETTY dang good. the 2 main actors in particular. i mean some of it was so subtle that i am thinking the video game, constant action n bright flashing lights crowd might miss it. *shrug* either way it was interesting to me. made me think."

It follows the plot, the actors are great and really bring the characters to life. If you've read the books, you will see it come to life. I really recommend that people who are thinking of seeing it, sees it because it was a great movie and never went off in a different direction, it stayed on point with the book. I would love for them to make another movie, a sequel because they did a great job on this one and I would hate to see the rest not made because it really got me hooked.<br/><br/>Give the movie a chance, it was very well acted and produced.

","A spontaneous trip to the cinema resulted in the 'interesting' experience of watching 'Fifty Shades of Grey'. Honestly, my only two thoughts during the film were: is this young adult woman really that pathetic (or is she just thinking that her behaviour is 'cute') and whether the movie was a re-make of Twilight just without the Vampirism element - Mr. Grey and his ever brooding and agonised persona was a too great of a flashback of Edward Cullen.<br/><br/>The only thing I had heard about this film (and book) before I watched it was that some found it female-liberating and some found it female- oppressive. I think that what ever you do in your boudoir - you do in your boudoir as long as both parties are in an agreement (the whole Dominant- Submissive thing), but the relationship between Ana and Christian, outside the bedroom, is VERY manipulative and degrading, and I ponder how someone (based solely on the film, of course) might find their relationship romantic."

It's a very CONESNUAL relationship that isn't really in the norm of today's society however there are people who do this on a day to day basis. I think the direction could have been a little better, minus a few things everything that was in the book was in the film like any normal adaptation. <br/><br/>I myself have read the books and yes, it's a little poor but it did descend from a (twilight) fan fiction. Not that it matters but as a 17 year old I know of a few fan fictions and if someone decides to publish it they change a few things not the whole entire book. <br/><br/>Anyway, I enjoyed it overall.

","Although I do not find this film quite as terrible as others, it was not particularly one that I enjoyed either. I have read the book as well, so naturally I was constantly comparing the film to the book throughout the entire thing.<br/><br/>I felt that the movie was very choppy, left out many parts that I found significant in the book, and that it had no aspect of mystery or room to let the viewers mind wander. It was a film about an average, college student who begins to fall for a rich entrepreneur who is completely different from her in every aspect. We learn about his secrets, and watch as the couple tries to overcome them but in the end can not. It is your generic love plot, just converted into a much more erotic and dark way.<br/><br/>The movie went from scene to scene, often with no transition at all. Had I not read the book, I would have gotten lost. The filmmakers should have found a way to get from one place to another in a way that continued the story line but that flowed easier.<br/><br/>I felt that the acting could have been better, however I do feel like they captured the look of the characters in the book well. Both Dornan and Johnson acted well, but I didn't feel the chemistry between them that I felt in the book. They appeared almost as if they were nervous and uncomfortable around each other.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was an okay film that I wouldn't recommend unless you don't mind skimming details and lots of inappropriate scenes."

When her roommate asks her to interview billionaire Christian Grey (Dornan) for the school paper she nervously accepts. He immediately becomes infatuated with her and does everything he can to win her over. When she finally accepts his invitation to his place she is shocked at what she sees. The two enter into a very strange relationship where neither fully understands what the other wants. This movie is a phenomenon and unless you live under a rock you know what the movie is about. Like you I knew about all the controversy going in and was really looking for what the fuss was about. 50% of the problems people have with the movie has to do with the fact that the woman is so submissive to the man therefore this portrays women in a negative light, by doing whatever a man says. The other 50% says its pornography and should be banned. I am a man but I have to think that all of the people that had this critique about this movie never actually saw it. While the movie does show sex acts rarely seen in a mainstream movie it is done more erotic than pornographic. I don't want to give anything away to the 5 people that haven't seen it or read the book but she is not as submissive as people will have you believe. I look at it as the other way around.

","I had read the books and found them addictive! The character and relationship development, in my opinion, had made the books as successful as they've been.<br/><br/>I thought the casting was on mark with both Ana and Christian believably played. The trailers gave you just enough to get you hooked. Unfortunately, the whole movie could be a series of trailers clipped together.<br/><br/>Key scenes and events were all hit: interview in the first minute of the movie, hardware store, bar, graduation, meeting the parents for dinner, boathouse, trip to Georgia and the final leaving scene. But the lack of detail going into tying it all together was sorely disappointing.<br/><br/>In the opening scene, the interview, the opportunity to look at the art in Christian's office to begin to develop her character and generate a common interest is not include. This strips the scene down to awkward questioning from her and ends with him submitting an emailed response to Kate for all of the questions (which is factually incorrect.) The hardware store has the potential to develop her character as the na√Øve college student who has no clue she's attractive or more than a genderless blob. It suckers you in with the super steamy blood pumping, I never thought I'd see you again shopping scene. But then it continues on to end with a really odd scene where Christian is supposed to be upset about the brother Paul who appears no more than as a cameo in one shot.<br/><br/>This odd adaptation continues through the whole movie. No whisking her into a locker room for an answer. No chicken pox discussion when meeting the parents. Which leads to a very blunt they're burns convo versus a scene that had the potential to be moving with her sickening realization that they're burns and not pox marks. No boathouse getting her panties back scene. No make-up sex in Georgia. No character development with Toxic playing in the car to learn more about the crazy ex-sub. No breakfast at Ihop. No development with the 1st class upgrade.<br/><br/>You strip all of the little details of the book out and what do you have?

","This film is not recommended. (Rating: ‚òÜ‚òÜ out of 4)<br/><br/>In brief: 50 ways to bruise your lover...and an audience as well.<br/><br/>GRADE: C<br/><br/>Floggers ready...it's time to beat a dead horse! 50 Shades of Grey has arrived, a guilty pleasure that quickly becomes a guiltless displeasure.<br/><br/>But first, let me digress...Years ago, my sweet elderly mother drove out-of-town to see the racy Saturday Night Fever, a popular R-rated film. Her desire to see this film proved greater than her actual enjoyment but, at least, she was able to experience it first hand and no one she knew would know her dirty little secret. Her reputation remained purloined and intact. I bring this up as that film was nearly forty years ago and not much has changed with the latest sexual romp being Fifty Shades of Grey. The beat (or the beatings) goes on, even with its wall-to-wall contemporary pop soundtrack.<br/><br/>ÔøºWe now return to our regular scheduled review: Fifty Shades of Grey is a dull boring affair. The sex on screen is strictly rote, badly wrote. Most of this carnal action has been seen countless times in other sex films. You know the routine: quick cuts of breasts, rears, and even quicker glimpses of genitalia interspersed with arched backs and stylized poses in various states of undress, all looking for unattainable ecstasy. The sex is sanitized for the masses. After all, it has a R-rating. It's the softest of soft porn.<br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey celebrates sexual diversity while condemning that sexual choice with Puritan fanaticism. It's smug, condescending, and pure fantasy. The filmmakers plays both sides hoping men can relate to that male dominance angle while women can empathize with their sensual desires. (I won't get into the debate of degrading women or the issue of sexual domination and violence. This film degrades mankind in its silly treatment and romantic disillusion of pleasure and pain.) <br/><br/>ÔøºJames Dornan and Dakota Johnson play the mismatched lovers, Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. Grey is handsome, sexy, and rich. He is ""the world's most eligible billionaire bachelor"". Ana is a young awkward and naive virgin, ready to be plucked and educated in the fine art of lovemaking. They stare longingly at each other. They breathe heavily and talk dirty. They strip down often, moping more than groping. The endless droning and groaning at the height of their sexual passions is repeated often between their trips to the infamous ""red"" room, a private boudoir filled with the all of the latest S&M equipment that money can buy. Ana continually bites her lips. Christian plays the piano whenever he needs a Zen moment since he never can crack a smile. He showers his pretty woman with expensive gifts and demands of obedience. She complies. And so it goes. On and on. <br/><br/>Their mating dance becomes downright laughable. and their dialog is just awful. The actors are so intense and deadly serious, uttering this nonsense with every spoken sentence ending in large exclamation points. Both Mr. Dorman and Ms. Johnson are physically attractive performers, but their acting never rises to any level of reality. That they were able to say their lines with the straightest of faces, at least, shows some acting restraint. (I wish them all the luck in the future with more challenging roles than these one-dimensional characters allow.) <br/><br/>ÔøºThe director, Sam Taylor-Johnson, does an adequate job, but she seems as obsessed with the excesses of Mr. Grey's vast empire as our darling Anastasia. This is a big budget picture after all, even if there is no real money shot. The director carefully places her camera strategically out of view of any male frontal views. (But there is still a fleeting glimpse of Ms. Johnson's private area that goes pubic, I mean public. So much for woman's liberation.) <br/><br/>As Mr. Grey so eloquently states at one point in the movie, ""I'm fifty shades of f**ked up.""

","A comment I heard before the movie was ""it's not good, but watchable"", was very fitting post watching Fifty.<br/><br/>The movie had some great points; Dakota Johnson was fantastic in the lead. She was the exact character fit. I believe her acting bettered the character of the books. Her comic timing of scenes really made 'Anna' age appropriate and likable.<br/><br/>Things that just didn't work as well...<br/><br/>Jamie Dorian, I think he over thought the character and it didn't work. His physical presence wasn't compelling and his chemistry with Dakota wasn't tangible. Also, his accent slipped too many times, the script should have just made him 'English'.<br/><br/>I felt that some of the nudity was there for nudity sake, not adding to the overall scene. I disagree with other comments regarding assault.<br/><br/>The two biggest areas of improvement...<br/><br/>The lighting, it was extremely poor to the point where it made most of BDSM scene awkward. The brightness of the BDSM scene felt like the 'red room' was a school class room full of fluorescent lighting. The movie needed to utilize more moody lighting such as the 'negotiation scene'. The overall movie needed a moodier feel.<br/><br/>The script was too jammed pack with scene from the book that it made the movie feel rushed. It didn't build the required tension between the two main characters. It would have been better to have fewer scenes which were longer and more detailed.<br/><br/>My recommendation is to watch it once it's on DVD without any expectations."

The main characters have less engaging chemistry than a two hour chemistry lecture presented by a professor who should have retired a hundred years ago at 3 o'clock on a Friday afternoon. If there was a huge amount of sex going on in this movie it would be more awkward and uncomfortable as opposed to sexy. Why? Because there is zero sexual tension in this movie which culminates in it committing the worst sex movie/porno sin...inducing boredom. Severe boredom. <br/><br/>I give this movie props for two things: one it's actually shot fairly well and does it's best to create an intimate atmosphere (unfortunately the dialogue and awkwardness undoes all that hard work) Secondly at least it's not as laughably bad as the book its based on. Two kinda positive points results in it being given a 2/10. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading and if you found this helpful /enjoyable check out my other reviews."
"sarahfortune97","10","2","5","23 February 2015"," Loved it, very much exceeded my expectations
","I actually loved this film. I have not read the books, nor do I plan to. Although many are loathing it, I personally thought it wasn't at all as bad as people are making it out to be. Despite the rumors that Jamie & Dakota don't get along in real life, I thought they had a great on-screen chemistry. If you can get your head past all of the sex, and there is a LOT of it, it actually has a good story line. Speaking of the sex, I thought that there wasn't nearly as much as I had expected, which pleasantly surprised me. Being a young adult, I'm not keen on watching too much of it! Even the nakedness wasn't too much to handle. As for the cast: A+! One of the best- looking casts I've seen in a while. Jamie Dornan is gorgeous and Dakota Johnson is beautiful! Finally, the soundtrack is incredible, especially the Ellie Goulding song ""Love Me Like You Do"". I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys romantic movies (with sex!), as long as they're at least 16. Please do not see this if you are under 16, as I believe it is strongly inappropriate."
"ebrewer09","7","2","5","23 February 2015"," Faithful to the book
","I just watched the film in the theater. I enjoyed the book more than the film. I felt the film was a bit choppy and left out some character building scenes, especially for the supporting cast basically what happen to all of them after they graduated. If you are wondering Kate, and Elliot go on vacation with Kate's family. Jose apologize to Ana for being a dick . I really wish they put the art scene in the movie. One I was really wanting to see the painting (they sounded interesting), and secondly I think that scene showed Christian that Ana, was smart and not just and awkward frumpy college student who had nice lips. In the move, there was a lot of scene that missed the ""why"" in which something happened that were more fully explained in the book. For instance the panties scene, and the reason he gave her those particular books. I was actually surprised by the chemistry the two actors had, it wasn't the best chemistry I have ever seen be, but it was more than I was expecting from the cold fish interviews I had seen both of them give. For the BDSM/sex in the movie, it really isn't that extreme basically spanking with various things and some bondage, I been to a BDSM parties before and that was something. On a scale from 1 to 10 it probably a scale of a 4 for kink. Just do a search for BDSM, and there are some things you just cannot unsee."
"Thefilmhead65411","4","2","5","22 February 2015"," horrible chemistry for a movie about about relationships
","As I am not the target audience for fifty shades of Grey nor did I read any of the books, I am married to someone who did care to read the books and has now seen the film. As I stated before I did not read the books so I have the added benefit of judging this as just a film rather than judging it as an adaptation. <br/><br/>This movie is not atrocious but its not good by any means. This film is all about a relationship, regardless of what they do in there relationship, This is the key factor in this film, the most important part about it. It was this key element that fifty shades of Grey lacks. The relationship between Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey was not believable at all. The chemistry between the two actors was stiff and unbelievable. Although Dakota's performances was the redeemable quality of this film. It was Jaime's performance that gave the relationship it's stiff and scripted feel. Even though I didn't read the books and I don't know what Christian Grey's character is suppose to be, I still felt his character should have had more presence on the screen, Anastasia up staged him totally when he is suppose to be the dominant one.<br/><br/>One of the biggest complaints I heard about the book was how poorly the book was written. This is clearly the case because the script was awful. The dialog, the story, and most importantly the relationship between Christian and Anastasia. I think this film had the potential to portray this relationship and all it entails with out making an all out smut film, but by having an actor who dominates the screen, as the relationship. Someone with more charisma. Instead it was Anastasia who stole the scenes.<br/><br/>I think my biggest problem with this film is the fact it would have been interesting to see this story play out the way it was suppose to. To take this taboo subject and have it reflected in this film. I am going to give fifty shades of Grey a 4 out of 10. I recommend this if you have read the books and want to see this play out on the big screen, unfortunately if you liked the book I think your gonna be disappointed. Thanks for reading"
"elizusui","5","2","5","18 February 2015"," Bad Directing
","I love the book. Read the entire trilogy. However, the movie was disappointing. Dakota Johnson is a good actress. However, Christian Grey looked really short in the movie (in comparison, Tom Cruise is short, but he never looks short in any of his movies. Height should not matter). Several of the intimate scenes lacked good camera angles, editing, and heat. The scenes should have been shot with more focus on bringing the sensuality into the movie. The script was not bad, but Dakota Johnson has a playful side that could have been played up more in the movie. She is a good actress and the director should have used her more rather than going for a cut and dry interpretation of the movie. For example, the dance scene could have showcased a more playful side of her and the dancing between Christian and Anna should have been beautifully shot. the red room suspense was lacking too. The problem was that imagination just did not come alive on the cameras. I am disappointed and want to ask for a remake of the movie using the same actors!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"imane6666","6","2","5","18 February 2015"," It wasn't that bad!
","OK it's not the movie of the year... but if you enjoyed the books, you will enjoy the movie to a certain level. Dakota J plays a fun Ana, Jamie D is really hot, however he is a weak version of Christian Grey. The biggest drawback from my opinion is that the movie is a bit superficial compared to the books where you get a deep insight of the characters and what they are experiencing. The movie is just a series of ""illustrations"" of the best scenes from the book... There is no way you will enjoy this movie if you haven't read the books and enjoyed them. As to the sex scenes, they do not do justice to the book but they are hot enough. This movie will need the sequels to actually make sense. It needs to be enjoyed as a trilogy rather then one movie...It's not like Harry Potter or Twilight were you can actually ""get"" or enjoy the films without having read the books. AGAIN, don't bother watching this film if you haven't read the books."

",". . . read THE STORY OF O or THE PEARL (NOT the one by Steinbeck!) or both by the end of her freshman year. It's a sad commentary on today's generation of self-imposed Sharia-like Puritanism that the palest plagiarism of what the Victorians read for entertainment 150 years ago raises eyebrows and not hilarious laughter today. FIFTY SHADES OF GREY might be a tad more accurate about First Edition books than the makers of THE BOY NEXT DOOR were, but the character of ""Anastasia Steele""--an alleged Romance Literature graduate so ignorant of the basics in her academic field--does not ring true. Nor do the cheap production values of this flick, which seem better suited to the BARNEY and TELETUBBIES crowd than to any serious movie goer. For instance, Anastasia attends a university in Portland, OR. But this tawdry production was thrown together in the world's knock-off capital, Vancouver, Canada. So when ""Christian Grey"" gives the graduation speech to Anastasia's class, his podium is draped with a ""Vancouver"" banner. (Given the kinds of consistent flaws found in EVERY let's-pretend-it's-America flick originating in Vancouver, it's doubtful they even have a community college there--none of the film crews ever have anything on the ball!) Most everything about FIFTY SHADES is equally wrong and jarring. The book implies that Christian ""punishes"" Anastasia with a taste of what the soap thief got in 12 YEARS A SLAVE. But all her ""abuse"" combined is less than one-tenth the trauma of one lash in SLAVE. If Bill Cosby ever needs to stand trial, his lawyers may use a FIFTY SHADES defense to argue the horrible consequences of old billionaires messing with UN-drugged young ladies."
"lapachatnoir","6","2","5","15 February 2015"," Probably good movie message to the girls to avoid this type of guy if she would meet in reality
","Actually I was first warn by one friend do not watch the movie because it is glorifying woman abuse and rape. But I alway want first to see and then have opinion about it. I think every movie gives you some kind of message to learn or some are just for a pleasure to relax your mind or have a good laugh. It puzzled me out why this movie was on Valentines day? I thought maybe it is to let you understand how BDSM can become as sexual excitement to person who is new to it, because I do not really get it myself. But I could not sense it from Ana's play only that she liked the guy and wanted to get to know him better and decided to please him because it was the only way that he allowed to get to know him better. His way of trying to show that he is interested in her, but then pulling away, controlling and just buying her with expensive gifts to submit to his cruel emotional and then physical abuse... Well it is actually good message to young and unexperienced girls that if you meet the creep like this just run away as fast as you can, don't give up your pride, self respect, woman are not a doll for sexual pleasure and especially not for any kind of physical abuse let alone mental abuse with control and emotional distance. I give it 6 star because it is a good message to understand and recognize that there can be psychopaths like that and avoid to get involved in real life, movie is well maid and actors play it very well, I was watching it with desire to see what will be next, it keeps you engaged, only would not recommend to watch this movie on Valentines day if you want to see something romantic that ends happily. I didn't read the book maybe there was different kind of idea the author wanted to pass to the readers. But it is never good idea to compare book with movie, book uses words and plays on your imagination and we all have different ideas and and the way we understand things. Actors and movie director have their own way to show it, so it is always going to be different. I would definitely recommend to watch it."

I love this film which is based on the book which I read in 2014 and saw the film opening day when it came out last year and I loved it. I loved the acting, the music, the film itself. I can't stand haters who rag on this film, it's not the best film ever made but what is? It's based on what you like not someone else and I love it. I have all the books, a poster, the soundtrack, some magazine and this and that. I love the acting of Jamie Dornan -Christian-and Dakota Johnson-Ana-I think they fit the characters from the book really well. Of course most are going to take mostly about the sex and yes their is a lot of sex in the film and books BUT there's a love story here that's under the surface that you need to see to understand."

","Having read all the books I think this is a pretty dam good book to film!<br/><br/>Had low expectations of the film to be honest, didn't like who was cast for Anastasia and Christian but having watched it, they fit the characters fantastically! Never seen Jamie before and only seen Dakota in small parts, she's the girl next door with sexuality perfectly! Strangely Rita Ora was good as the sister! <br/><br/>Felt as though it moved to fast at the start but always feel this way having read books before a film. Is portrayed well in my opinion with nice details slipped in from the book (Christian's jeans!!) <br/><br/>Only bad thing about the film is how it ended, for someone who hasn't read the books it may seem a bit hmm drastic. Another 10-15 could have softened it slightly. Personally I loved the ending left me gagging for more.<br/><br/>Can not wait for Fifty Shades Darker! Hope they don't take too long! Really don't understand the low IMDb rating!<br/><br/>Laters baby."

I fangirled when I heard that a movie would be produced though for the record it would have been better as a TV series on HBO, Cinemax, or Starz, but hey a movie was just as good as anything. I have to admit I was a bit skeptic of Jamie Dornan playing Christian because in some photos seen beforehand he had a Boy next boy/ Boyish meets Bad Boy look about him, but boy did he prove me wrong! Dakota Johnson was born for this role! I fell in love with her the minute she say ""Enlighten Me""! Granted a few things were a bit different, but that was expected.

If they had put in all the scenes then it would be a very long movie and the scenes were in depth then I would be a porn. So, I believe the director did a very nice job for what she had to go off. The actors did a very nice job. They portrayed the characters very well. Anna was very shy and acquired and Christian was suppose to be very blunt. So, I do believe that the movie was a very good movie and I would recommend anyone to see it. I would go see it again and buy it on DVD."

I'll be honest, the movie was a little boring but still awesome. So I give you an advice,watch the movie and don't care what others think, if you won't like write it,if you'll like write it too.

And I was so exited to see the movie, and the trailer kept it promises.<br/><br/>Jamie and Dakota was a good cast, we could touch their chemistry. They where perfect! You can sometimes hear Jamies real accent, but who can blame him given that he only had a month to prepare. 1 month from being cast to they started shooting, and in that time he and is pregnant wife relocated to Canada. That is amazing! Dakota was perfect for the part as Anastasia, and very believable. Jamie could have been more ""cold"" in the beginning, but other than that, he was a perfect Christian.<br/><br/>The movie felt a bit rushed at times, but I blame the script. And I also missed some parts from the book, but you cant put everything in to a 2 hour long movie....This movie is no Oscar material, but it was never meant to be that.

","I have to mention that I did read the book before seeing the movie. I think it is a big factor considering that lots of pretty explanatory scenes were cut of the script.<br/><br/>To begin with, I did not walk in the cinema with high expectations. I have read the book , I did not expect intense explicit scenes and I was aware that there will be more ""love story"" scenes than sexual violent scenes. The actors, in my opinion, did a pretty accurate job in illustrating the exact characters from the book. Also an A for daring to bare it all ( especially Dakota who appears naked several time, showing everything). I do think it is very brave to play a main character in this movie and I totally enjoyed their performance. <br/><br/>There was a lot of funny/sarcastic lines and the movie was pretty entertaining. The only thing I did not like was that the script was word by word from the book, no surprises there. <br/><br/>Also another bad thing was that they skipped a few scenes from the book that might leave viewers confused ( for example Grey knows Ana's friend even though he never met him). <br/><br/>Last, loved the subject changing from Valentine's super soppy romantic movies to something completely different and controversial. Again, congratulations to the actors, good job and I will probably go see the sequel considering I did enjoy the second and third book.<br/><br/>So, all in all, go in for entertainment, not for the best plot of the year or Oscar winning movie."

I don't even know that many colors. Do you?!<br/><br/>Anyway, I think 50/50 would have been a more direct title, but as this movie is more about honesty, self-worth, views, colors and all that good stuff...

If you go to this movie wishing to be told what a woman's mind is capable of, do go see it, you must... you might also enjoy it. After all our brains are somewhat alike. Yes, I meant woman's and man's brains.

","If you liked this movie either you are a female in hunger or a man with personality disorders. I read in a newspaper that a recent study reported that the woman who find this movie to be good have serious repressed sexuality issues. On the other hand, the guys who enjoy this movie apparently had problems in early stages of sexuality development. So if you had psychological growing issues during the organization of your individualization (separating from your mother) you will, for sure, like this movie; you can even feel some kind of pleasure by watching this perverted man (with serious sado-masochism disorders). It goes deeper in the early stages of the sexual development as Freud described it. I'm referring to the anal phase. The retention and lose of the faeces. The way you deal with it, and you cope, could determine sexually fixations, such as this. To the woman who wrote this story, this is also true; but, anyway, all the movies tells a lot about the ones who wrote them. Actually it seems that the movie could act as some form of catharsis, helping the writer to externalize her deepest, repressed and not fully-understanding desires. I must tell you, also, that this sexuality behaviour is not normal. Most of the people don't engage in this type of sexuality (wich in fact consists in a behavioural deviation) as the main form of satisfying their desires. Thankfuly! So, be warned. If you are one of those, there's still hope. Find a good analyst and deal with it. The world is full of people in psychological need. Don't be ashamed to ask for help, or cry for freedom."

Locations are pretty, but mainly the office of the company and the flat where Grey lives. Sex sequences are shooted with taste but they can't achieve a real emotion in you. The result, in general, is very boring because you know that you will not see a real end of the film.

It really didn't come off sexy, and instead the whole cinema laughed, and it wasn't the only corny lines that could have not come across like that if there was just better chemistry between Jamie and Dakota. <br/><br/>Dakota did a fantastic job. Honestly, if not for her this movie really would have flopped big time. She gave all of herself to the role, and you could see how hard she was trying to get the sexual chemistry between her and Jamie, but Jamie just fell flat.<br/><br/>Jamie looked like he'd rather not be there. I actually really like him as an actor. But he just let the film down. His accent was terrible, and he didn't come across sexy at all, and I don't felt like he portrayed Christian's character very well either.<br/><br/>If I hadn't of read the books and just seen the movie I wouldn't have been able to connect with characters. It would have come across like he was just a freak and stalker, which is so not how he comes across in the book. In the book you would do anything for him, and he is so mysterious that you want to know more about him. In the movie he isn't very interesting at all and you can't understand why Ana wants to be with him.<br/><br/>The other cast wasn't too bad, although Jose should have looked younger in my eyes.<br/><br/>Look its one of those movies I wouldn't be disappointed (actually I would prefer it) if they recast Christian's role for the next two.<br/><br/>Soundtrack was awesome! so points for that!<br/><br/>On a side note.... I wonder if Charlie's small re-writes that he wanted for this movie involved the corny scenes... you can't help but wonder if maybe they listened to him it wouldn't be as bad.<br/><br/>Oh and thank god they didn't add the tampon scene!<br/><br/>EDIT: I have since watched this film again and enjoyed it much more the second time and think I was too harsh on Jamie.

","i have to say that i really loved this film. when i go to the cinema i usually buy a ticket for the regular big budget sci-fic films or the stupid action films because that what the industry has to offer, but this time i decided to try something different, and than 50 shades came. as far as i know, many people did enjoy the film as much as i did but they just deny it. our world taught us that emotions and love is a bad thing and you must be cold and heartless when you talk to someone or unless they won't love you. many boys were moved buy this film and found the chemistry between the two main characters is charming, but if their friends will found out about that they would called ""Ga..."".<br/><br/>so, if you can watch '50 shades of grey' without any expectation, and you can admit to yourself that you are a human being and that feelings, love, and romance are a part of your basic natural needs, i promise that you will enjoy this one very much. com'on people, be a better friend to yourself."
"fhjohn","10","4","16","18 April 2015"," Extremely Intense and Intriguing movie
","I am very surprised so many people disliked this movie. Throughout the whole movie I was engaged and interested in the relationship between the two main characters. Having read the book I think that the movie was on par with its high quality entertainment. I felt as if the emotions that the characters were feeling and expressing directly got in touch with my very own emotions making for a great movie. I thought the two lead characters played their roles amazingly, their relationship showed the perfect amount of tension and conflict that was to be expected. By this I mean that their struggles matched what was portrayed in the book extremely well. I think most people who complain about this movie do so because they don't like they story rather then disliking how the actors, director, and writers portrayed the book. Overall I enjoyed the whole movie and was surprised by the amount of hate this movie received from almost everyone but myself."

","Worst actress in the world - Dakota!!!! I really liked the movie and the book too. I read all 3 of them. The movie is nice, nothing special but we cannot expect to be so good like the book. The other actors are good. May be just Christian sister /Maya/ is not what i expect /Rita Ora/ may be because in the book she is very younger that Elait and Christian. But Dakota does not overlap with character at all, she should be younger, smaller, delicate, cute and shy........ but she looks bigger than Mr. Grey and she look like a girl from some ranch - ROUGHT and BOTCHED! I do not know how and why they chosen her!!!! May be because her grandmother, mother, father, stepfather and....... I think that she is the reason for this very low score of the film like all. Really cross my fingers to change her in the other two future movies!!!!!!"

","as I am writing this, I am listening to the ellen (DeGeneres) show who is making a big hoopla about its release today. then I went to this site and my jaw dropped when I saw the 3.3 review. OK, I have not seen the movie and no I have not read the book, but I have seen an awful lot of movies with a sexuality content, including nymphomaniac, battle in heaven, all the other lars von trier movies, shortbus....well, need I go on. in my opinion, movies about sex do not necessarily have to be sexy, or a turn-on. it is about time that people realize that if they want to see explicit sex, they rent a porn flick. if they are interested in seriously contemplating human sexuality in all its nuances. some of these movies are doing just that and are not really meant to turn you on sexually."

"rebeccaedwards92","8","3","11","18 February 2015"," I'm one of the few who really enjoyed this film.
","First of all, I really do not understand why this film is getting so much hatred towards it. The director must be absolutely sick, she did a really good job to make this raunchy book into a film. Personally, I think people were expecting a lot more out of the sex scenes. They were just enough to watch without it being too 'cringey'. Basically if you want to watch a raunchy sex scene, then there is a thing called Porn..... I really enjoyed reading the books, and yes they weren't well written, but they were extremely popular and E.L James will be laughing now at how well she has done. I enjoyed the love story and feel that this was portrayed well in the film. I don't understand how people are saying there was no chemistry between Jamie and Dakota?!?! Of course there was!! To act in a film like this I can't help but applaud both of them. Really annoys me that people love to be internet trolls and criticise something for no reason. Also annoys me that most people who have hated the film haven't even read the books! So I feel that a comment can't be made. And to say that this film promotes violence is absolutely ridiculous, Ana gives consent for god's sake and it was rather uncomfortable to watch the last scene in the film but it happens in the book and has a strong link to Fifty Shades Darker. So people will change their minds about that opinion then. Just wanted to say all this because after seeing it twice now, I still don't understand why people hate it so much. I much rather enjoyed the last two books so hopefully people's minds will be changed later... 8/10 I give it."

","I am really distraught from all of this negative criticism. This movie reflects how some men like dominant sex and how some women like submissive sex (Or they don't know it yet). This movie highlights different forms of erotic pleasures (which a lot of the 'critics' find taboo). I am guessing they never have been spanked. <br/><br/>The acting was okay. The film is worth watching. I watched it with my significant other, and we both enjoyed it. <br/><br/>I guess some men and women are not comfortable with their sex life, or haven't experience different forms of erotic pleasure and quickly jump to judge the film; smh...<br/><br/>However, (spoiler alert), the ending is horrible! I would have rated this movie higher, but the ending was S***."

","I never read the book but I may soon. I heard a lot of hype about the book and never saw the movie. Now, two years later I decided to watch it on cable t.v. Today was my second time watching it. The reason why I liked it is the reality of him and her and how couples play games with each other in real life. I liked their chemistry a lot and of course, I loved the ending the best! I look forward to reading the book and watching the second movie, which is out in 2 days. Perhaps women look at this as a fantasy but to me, I liked her strength and I'm sure it was not easy for her to do what she did. I'll probably watch it again. Christian Grey is handsome and he reminds me of an old friend who looks like him when he was his age."

","It would be nice if parents stopped naming their little girls Dakota. As it stands, we're going to have an entire generation of women named Dakota. This particular Dakota is rather good, as far as it's possible to tell from her performance here as the young woman so much in love that she puts up with all sorts of bondage until she finally cries ""Enough!"" and the affair ends.<br/><br/>She's an attractive woman but not TOO attractive. Rather pleasant looking, with big blue appealing eyes. Her figure is feminine and ordinary. She's the kind of woman men might find themselves staring at in a supermarket without quite understanding why.<br/><br/>And she handles the role well. She's a virgin, her voice a tentative, slightly breathless whine. She has a menial job -- sales lady in a hardware shop -- like Sylvester Stallone's girl friend in ""Rocky."" And she accidentally runs into Jamie Dornan, a young, strapping, handsome, commanding presence who is filthy rich and courts her in a way every girl seems to dream of being courted. At least I guess so, because the pattern crops up so commonly, as in ""Pretty Woman."" From the beginning it was clear that this story was shaped by women, two of them in fact -- E. L. James and Kelly Marcel. If it had opened with an outrageous burst of violence, somebody's brains splattered on the wall, I'd figure a testosterone-ridden man was behind it all.<br/><br/>Jamie Dornan is a big nuisance. He stares fixedly. He only blinked twice, I counted. He never smiles. He issues orders. He seems to know everything, or thinks he does. And he's got the dough to back it all up. ""Come with me,"" he orders, and, poof, we're doing snap rolls in a sailplane. ""Don't fall in love with me,"" he advises her sternly, so she falls in love with him.<br/><br/>After the ritual deflowering comes the S&M but only its frisson. He never does anything very serious to her, just tickling her with a feathery lash while she's bound hand and foot. I don't know why this was painted as so scandalous. Far more can be found in other films, like ""Nine Weeks"" or ""Nine Songs,"" though you have to be ready for that last one.<br/><br/>Bondage and cheap love stories not being very interesting as far as I'm concerned, I thought the movie was lousy. You want it to have some emotional impact? Don't just cast the female lead as a wimp. Cast her as an overweight wimp. Or a menopausal wimp. Any normal man would like to pinch and bite Dakota Johnson. That's too easy, a sell out.<br/><br/>If you must have a dominant/subordinate relationship in which the woman participates, try ""Secretary,"" a much better film, even without nudity."
"leonblackwood","2","2","6","28 June 2015"," Pointless Crap! 2/10
","Review: What a load of rubbish! After all the dominating talk about what he's going to do with her with his weird and wonderful toys, he ends up falling in love with her and realises that he can't live without her so what is the point of this 2 hour long movie. The storyline is extremely simple! Basically, woman meets man! Man & Woman fall for each other! Man has a weird sex appetite! They Get It On! Simple! I thought there was going to be some major twists or some extremely explicit sex scenes but it was two hours of watching two people falling in love. I can see why women might have liked the attraction to a really warped minded man and intriguing billionaire but from a man's point of view, it's boring and pointless. The acting wasn't bad because I was intrigued about the individuals background but I can't help feeling cheated. Maybe it's better on paper than it is on the big screen! Anyway, it certainly took a lot of money at the box office so there's obviously an audience for this type of movie but I really didn't get why there is so much hype surrounding it. Terrible!<br/><br/>Round-Up: For a movie that is based around two characters falling in love, I really can't see were the $40million budget went. Jamie Doman has only really starred in TV series, except for his role in Marie Antoinette so he was a weird choice for this major blockbuster. Dakota Johnson has starred in quite a lot of movies, like 21 Jump Street, Need For Speed, The Social Network and Black Mass starring Johnny Depp and Benedict Cumberbatch so she's obviously got a lot of experience on the big screen. Personally, I haven't heard of her before so I thought that she was a newcomer. Anyway, the director, Samantha Taylor- Johnson, has only directed 2 other movies in her career which are Districted, Nowhere Boy. Maybe her lack of experience is what makes this movie so bad. Its been reported that she won't be returning to make Fifty Shades Darker or Fifty Shades Freed so there's a possibility that they might be much better than this rubbish.<br/><br/>Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $570million (WOW!)<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic movies about a woman who falls in love with a billionaire who has a weird, sexual appetite. 2/10"
"astokes-93743","1","2","6","14 June 2015"," What? I mean...what???
","As I'm sure many people have already stated out of all the actors who could have been chosen for the lead roles in this film, why on earth were two people who never showed any chemistry or connection with each other chosen? I have long been aware of the sad fact that all the details from the book cannot be included in the film, however I am still annoyed none of Anastasia's inner turmoil was focused on or presented. As can be expected the main focus of the film is the gratuitous sex scenes where, again, no chemistry is present between the characters (especially after the gliding lesson). All the dialogue by all characters is read, not spoken, as though from a phone book. I honestly struggled to keep my eyes open throughout the whole thing.<br/><br/>I cannot see any reason to recommend this garbage to anyone. If you're into that kind of thing then great - but there are loads of sources on the internet to find more appealing material."
"northernlad","3","2","6","13 June 2015"," Middle of Nowhere
","I'll admit that I tried to read the books but found them lacking and full of trite and ridiculous material. I failed to see what the big deal was about this story. Was it just sex? Surely not. Have we dropped so far in our sense of taste that this story was made a big deal solely because of its supposedly graphic nature? I can't believe that because there are other stories out there that are just as graphic that are beautifully written.<br/><br/>I'll also admit that I saw this movie twice. Once I watched it on my own because I was bored and I figured if I couldn't make through the book, the movie would surely be easier and less painful. In truth, it was. I was able to watch the movie completely. But unfortunately I'm still left wondering what the big deal was about this movie.<br/><br/>The pacing of the movie is terrible. It does two things. One, it rushes parts of the story that should be filled with character development and then two, it slows down to a snail's pace when showing unnecessary characters like her mother. Yes, her mother should be introduced at some point and this character should give some background as to why Ana would ever fall for such a guy as Christian Grey. It's true he's rich and somewhat good looking, but Ana knows more about him of course and she knows there is this supposed dark side to him. Maybe Anastasia's background could explain it. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen. All we get are slow scenes with her that take away from what little of this story there actually is.<br/><br/>In the end, I sat through the movie waiting for the big pay off. There had to be a point to this. I gave it ample to time to develop. Something to at least show me there was a point to this movie. Something that went somewhere. It unfortunately never happened. The story basically takes you to the middle of nowhere and stops.<br/><br/>What was the point of this movie? Why didn't it have a proper plot and pacing? The first story of a series should at least do that much. I fail to see where else this story could go after this? In the end, it's tired and been done before and much better. Plain girl comes across a mysterious, rich, and good looking man who is surrounded by beautiful women and of course he takes an interest in her and therefore plays out the fantasy of women everywhere right? Wrong. There are elements of that to this story but again it has been done before and again...much better.<br/><br/>There simply isn't much going on here.<br/><br/>I give it 3 stars because it was worth watching again with a friend just to get some laughs out of it and to riff it a bit. If you're into that, it'll serve it's purpose and enjoy. If not, just skip this one. Go watch a good porn, there is probably a better story there."

There was no chemistry between the lead actors and the soft-porn-esque ""sex"" scenes were truly cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>The worst part of it is the underlying notion of powerful, successful white guy who gets to own (or buy; depending how you look at it) another person for his own amusement. <br/><br/>My partner and I both find the notion offensive; we turned the DVD off after about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>I am so glad we didn't see this at the cinema; would have been a waste of good money!<br/><br/>I tried to change my vote to ""0""."

","I did not read the book, I saw the film then I got myself a copy of the book. I think the Director did a good job, the adjustments she made gave faster pace to the story and lost nothing that is essential. I disagree to comments that there is no chemistry between Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson on screen. there is. They project faithfully and successfully the attraction the characters have for each other on screen. they each fit the looks of the characters described in the book. Jamie has the posture, the penetrating look on one hand and aloofness on the other. Dakota plays just right the part of a young, innocent and pretty graduate, unaware of her own sensuality. She takes after her mother, Melanie Griffith, sensuality is no lacking. I am not a middle age spinster or desperate housewife, I like a good love story and I look forward to the making of the sequel."

","When I heard that the trilogy of poorly written books were being made into movies I began to convince myself that they, in turn, would also be pretty bad. I wasn't sure about the casting at first but after seeing the movie it's really not that bad. I've read the books, out of pure curiosity at first, but then again with general interest. The story line is generally intact, with a little of the BDSM trimmed off for mainstream people which I assumed would happen. It's not an award winner(although I wouldn't be surprised if Dakota Johnson is nominated simply for making the phrase 'Holy cow' seem slightly less geeky and strange). All in all this movie wasn't a big disappointment, but it also wasn't a huge win. It was well made and followed the storyline pretty closely. I'd say it's definitely worth a watch if you're already partially interested."

Think about it this way, the movie was not an hour and fifty minutes of full out sex, like the book, was it? No! And people seem to go into the theatres thinking that the movie will be so sexy and hot, and don't get me wrong it is! But it's not what people are expecting because there is somewhat of a love story forming and people are watching this movie as you would a movie all about sex rather than a movie all about a love forming from sex!

","Those who have read the book don't go for the movie, those who have watched the movie don't go for the book. Yes, this is what a book adaptation most of the times results in and, Fifty shades is no different. What's disappointing is the reluctance to tread even an inch off of the already laid path. This is where direction kicks in, this where ""how-differently-can-it-be-done"" kicks in. Making movies based upon books has always been a challenging task for every film maker but, this Fifty Shades Of Grey doesn't appear to have been a challenging task at all. It moves at a set pace throughout its running length, leaving no chance for its audience to not check their cell phones while watching the movie, and whispering around. If the movie's titled ""Fifty Shades Of Grey,"" it should've been all about those shades only and not a love story basically. It seemed nothing, nothing but a love story that the audience absolutely would not have gone to theatres for. I can't help but compare the characters with the book and, the characters lacked intensity in the movie I must say. So, if this title has really got you spurred and if you haven't watched the movie yet, better spend your time reading those 356 pages (the read's a delight) rather than killing your curiosity in a couple of hours and end up saying....""yeah that was ummm...a fine movie."" This movie got people from all over the world anticipated, it should've been something SPECTACULAR, not just fine."

The innocent and naive Ana starts to realize she wants him. Despite his enigmatic reserve and advice, she finds herself desperate to get close to him. Not able to resist Ana's beauty and independent spirit, Christian Grey admits he wants her too, but on his own terms. Ana hesitates as she discovers the singular tastes of Christian Grey - despite the embellishments of success, his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, and his loving family, Grey is consumed by the need to control everything.<br/><br/>After this ""short"" storyline, I must say, this movie is worst movie I saw in my entire life. OK, when you saw a trailer, you thought that this movie is going to be something like porn. Of course, it's not. In this movie sex is dispute thing. I was waiting for something interesting to happen, but after some time you'll give up. But I didn't . I was waiting and waiting, and nothing. Movie dialogs are full of bad acting and clich√©s. You would expect that actors like Dakota Johnson would act so bad (I mean, that bad).

I finished those books in less than a week, English is not my first language but you can tell that it was poorly written and not much documented about BDSM. I give two stars for the music.

"Daisy_05","2","2","6","13 March 2015"," Fifty shades of disappointment
","After reading the books (first one was OK at best, the second and third were unrealistic and ridiculous), I was really looking forward to the film, especially when Dornan was cast at the last minute as I have watched him in The Fall and other shows. After seeing this however I am utterly disappointed. <br/><br/>Firstly, it's way too rushed. It feels like the writers just skimmed through the book completely and didn't focus on any scene in particular. <br/><br/>The script doesn't deviate away from the book much at all which is a major problem. Just hearing Jamie Dornan saying that he ""wanted to f*** her into next week"" made cringe uncontrollably. The fact that the author played such a big part in the adaptation is worrying. Her writing is abysmal. Understandably the messaging and emails had to be included but was so distracting at times but also totally pointless. Snaps have to be given for leaving out the ""inner goddess"" and ""holy craps"" that were forever mentioned in the books.<br/><br/>The fact that no big famous actors like Ryan Gosling didn't want any part in it should have been a hint to Johnson and Dornan. Yeah, it will get their names out there and yeah, it will boost their ""star power"" and fame, but when you're starring in an adaptation of Twilight fan- fiction, the alarm bells must be ringing. Plus Charlie Hunmam dropped out. Sure, he might not get the fame out of it like he could have but he has his dignity and integrity well intact.<br/><br/>Johnson does fit the character well. The clumsiness and innocence is well matched to the tone of the books but she is a bit uneven throughout the film.<br/><br/>I have prided myself for the last year or so to have been a massive fan of Dornan through his work on the Fall which is incredible. He is so believable, so creepy yet enticing, you almost don't want h to get caught. The fact he chose to even audition for this film disappoints me on a large scale. He could have brought so much to this character given the similarities Christian Grey has to his character in the Fall. He accent is wobbly at times, his facial expressions rarely change, and he looks like he would rather be anywhere else even when it's a normal scene with no sex whatsoever. I don't think I can sum up in one word how confused and disgruntled I am that he took on this role. It had not done his career any favors especially as his breakout role in the US. <br/><br/>I can't fault the setting and actual cinematography of the film. The locations especially Grey's apartment are wonderful and exactly how I imagined them. Snaps to the director and the crew for it. As for the actual sex scenes, I thought i would finish watching the film with my jaw on the floor or be horrified if I even saw cable ties or a riding crop in my life again. But overall I'm actually indifferent to it. None of it shocked me to my core (except for the fact that I saw Johnson's breasts so many times although that's to be expected). They weren't ""hardcore"" or ""groundbreaking"" at all. Maybe it was the fact that the scenes individually were quite short or the fact that they had to be tamer than expected for rating and such. Either way, I could have watched a cut version and not have missed them at all. The sex scenes in the Wolf of Wall Street shocked me more than any other film and they weren't even the most shocking parts. <br/><br/>Overall, I have been left completely underwhelmed by this film which has be advertised in my face for the last three months of my life. I bought into the hype and couldn't wait to see the movie everyone was talking about, that had booked out multiple showings and had broken box office records. Most of all I couldn't wait to see one of my favorite actors, an actor that prides himself on privacy and living out of the limelight finally hit the big time and show Hollywood what they were missing out on. If I'm being honest this should have never been adapted into a film. Mediocre writing rarely turns into movie gold. To make the second and third films in my opinion would destroy Both of their careers before they have even begun. This franchise is a sinking ship poised to sink th the bed of the ocean."

","I understand why the book made such a fuss. But the movie is overrated. I watched this movie about a man who has mental health issues,(some kind of PTSD and possibly some type of identity problem.) He might possibly also be narcissistic. The movie borders on and then sometimes crosses the line on abusive behavior. Of course the door is left open at the end for a sequel. Just not what I wanted to see or what I thought I would see. No wonder there has been such a fuss. It's time to discuss sexually abusive behavior and get rid of it. I felt so bad for both of the main characters. I hope that when they do the next movie they address these issues and resolve them in a manner that is acceptable. Slapping, spanking, etc. can result in dislocated joints and broken bones."

","The advertisements for this movie left little to hope for. So I didn't go into it with high hopes and even then it managed to disappoint. The acting was forced and pathetic. It was set out like a teenage love film with occasional scenes of horrifically strange sex acts. It would also have been great if Ana followed the common procedure of shaving her private area... or at least trimming it dear Heavens. I literally fell asleep during this movie and got woken up by another viewer falling asleep and dropping their popcorn. The movie ends with the suggestion of the other two books being made into movies but Jamie Dornan is refusing to be Mr Grey anymore so it will hardly make sense. However, thanks to this wonderful decision of his a third series of The Fall has been announced."
"FilmsFilmsFilms19","4","2","6","10 March 2015"," Fifty Shades of Mediocre
","A film that had been highly anticipated by lovers of the book should and should not be disappointed. <br/><br/>Based on a TWILIGHT FAN FICTION (yes that needed to be emphasised), you wouldn't really expect the film to be great. And it isn't. Tones of the origin of the idea are visible. For example, how Anastasia Steele who is a shy character falls in love with Christian Grey, someone who just simply ""can't do love"". (Does it remind you of Bella and Edward?)<br/><br/>The acting is mediocre. Dakota Johnson portrays Ana well. There may be a few times where she bites her lip a little too much, but other than that I have no complaints. Jamie Dornan on the other hand, my heart goes out to you.<br/><br/>In 'The Fall', you were exceptional. It was a very enticing, intriguing show and always had me on the edge of my seat. However in Fifty Shades, me being on the edge (of anything) wasn't the case. There were hints of his original Irish accent that came through when some words were spoken in an American accent (not that I minded because either way, hot) but Christian Grey may as well have been a serial killer, ""not today"" though.<br/><br/>One problem I had was the progression of the relationship between Ana and Christian. It feels very quick, and when it is brought into light how long they have been together, it makes you question how sad your love life is (or it did in my case). <br/><br/>The film is quite obviously, nowhere near as explicit as the book. There are a few sentences that Christian says that makes me cringe, but I'm glad that this is the case as if it were to be more explicit I reckon that police may be required at the screenings. <br/><br/>Overall with all sex aside (which probably makes up 1/5th of the film), it fits into the romance category, with a shade of creepiness from yours truly, Christian. What's good about the film is really hard for me to put into words but would I recommend it? It's worth a watch, but I think I'd rather watch porn as there is most likely to be some sort underlying storyline that makes sense."

","Reading all three books, which weren't horrible and actually did have a story to tell, this movie was a complete disappointment. For those who read the books in their entirety (and didn't just flip through to the sexual content), the book does have an interesting character driven story. However, from Christian Grey's appearance to Ana's inability to not look like a moron trying to pull off a sexy lip-biting look, the movie is completely miscast. I doubt that the actors or anyone involved in the making of this movie actually took the time to read the original book.

Dakota Johnson was comparatively a better actor among the two and though I haven't watched any movies of Jamie Dorman and can't say how his acting is but in this movie it was horrible.He was clearly not suited for the role and was forcefully trying to get that domineering look of Christian Grey.

","**Potential spoilers**<br/><br/>It may be some seriously low-hanging fruit, but I feel like this movie is the perfect example for what happens when virtually every single one of the seven Catholic media keys are ignored in a production. As the name ""Catholic"" implies, these keys are universally applicable and not limited in any way to explicitly Christian media. As one could probably glean from a plot synopsis alone, Fifty Shades of Grey misses the mark on basically all of these guidelines for wholesome media. The first and most egregious offense is clearly against the dignity of the human person, which the third key states must be upheld in a quality piece of media; the movie practically centers around the degradation and use of a young woman by a sadistic and abusive man, and in their portrayal of this, those responsible for the film botched any attempt to preserve the truth of this type of relationship (abandoning the fourth key) in trying to glorify the BDSM lifestyle. The film was anything but inspiring, neglecting the fifth key entirely and replacing it with a despair and use-centered ideology of sexual relationships. This list could go and on, but for the sake of brevity, we shall leave it here. Hopefully this film serves as a warning to other producers and directors alike ‚Äì ignoring these guidelines can be disastrous for a movie's integrity as art and entertainment."

"lucasnochez","2","2","6","2 March 2015"," Film Review: Fifty Shades of Grey/www.nightfilmreviews.com
","I bet that if I were to ask the majority of the main demographic watching Fifty Shades of Grey this weekend what the acronym BDSM stands for, I would get a very unsatisfied and baffled answer. Low and behold, welcome to the world of popular culture and worldwide phenomenas for no damn good reason.<br/><br/>If someone were to ask me, how and why this particular novel, written atrociously by British author E.L. James became such a huge success, I wouldn't know where to begin. Upon all the controversy, arguments and opinions about the novel and its depiction of submissive sexual culture, I guess we, as a general population, have to accept the fact that sometimes, people and certain pieces of pop culture, just get lucky for being around at the right place, at the right time.<br/><br/>It's not like erotic literature or erotic novels didn't exist before E.L. James' novel, its that THIS particular novel caught on with readers and has become the worldwide best-seller for the simple fact that, it just did. Upon learning about my advance sneak passes to the film, I went in with the highest level of professionalism and optimism possible, but when a film knows its going to be a hit, regardless of its talent and execution on screen, you pretty well have sealed your fate in the world of film criticism.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the actors and screenwriter Kelly Marcel intended for the dialogue and execution of the film to be so wooden, laughable and campy, but I guess when you are adapting a film to a novel that has been deemed unworthy of professional publication, regardless of your level of screen writing and acting skills, you can't do much. From the moment the screen is filled with the shaded lighting of corporate florescent bulbs in the Grey building, one cannot help but notice how little effort is put into the film's production.<br/><br/>Set around one of the most conventional narrative foundations ever, Fifty Shades of Grey is your typical Romeo and Juliet love story of forbidden love. Upon learning of her friend Kate's (Eloise Mumford) illness, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is forced by her best friend to cover for school newspaper's article upcoming interview with the mysterious and intimidating business magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Once Ana and Christian meet, the two begin a steamy and sensual relationship filled with singular sexual tastes, obsession, seduction and mental and emotional pain and pleasure. Yup, thats it.<br/><br/>Before the film even started production, the casting process gain high media attention. Having Angelina Jolie reject directing the film, Chritian Cooke, Dominic Cooper and Stephen Amell circling the role of Christian Grey, and talented actresses Felicity Jones, Elizabeth Olsen, Imogen Poots and Shailene Woodley reportedly being considered and auditioning for the role of Ana Steele, the cast was settled with Dakota Johnson and Charlie Hunnam. Hunnam, who withdrew from the film due to a backlash of media frenzied fans who said the role simply wasn't meant for the actor, officially abandoned the project and was replaced by Dornan. Notice how more is being written about the casting history of the film more than the plot itself?<br/><br/>The lead actors of the film, must have approached the role as a double edged sword of fame and credibility. For one, Johnson and Dornan are destined of becoming household names, especially with the promise of huge economic gain, given the novels already huge fan base and demands of sequels. Yet, Fifty Shades of Grey brings to question one very important question: are artists and actors, willing to sacrifice their artistic integrity for fame and fortune? I mean, how else could one describe the leads being able to learn and mesmerize their lines in only five days?<br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey did not upset me as much as I thought it would. What upsets me most about this highly questionable and overwhelmingly popular phenomena is its misuse in everyday people's lives and the misleading conception of romance and its force for capitalist gain. Whereas, this time of year, romantic films are cleverly slotted before the Valentine's Day week, this is one film that abandons romance and the pure notion of 'love' for sole monetary gain. Do people really care to be the submissive? Is there going to be a surge in toys and fetish tools thanks to the film? Quite possibly. How else do you explain an officially marketed branding of fifty shades sex toys and fetish equipment at your local sex store?<br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey is a film void of romance, as is the chemistry between its leads. Forcing to become lovers: one a submissive and one a dominant, is clearly seen between the chemistry of Johnson and Dornan. Looking more like two people exploring the world of James' highly clich√©d and unoriginal imagination, Johnson and Dornan look strapped and tied to fake and cheap material within every frame. Hopefully, the scars and marks left from the production doesn't act as a metaphorical stain for these two talented actors for the rest of their careers by being typed casted.<br/><br/>My biggest concern of the film is if, by forcing this popular notion of submission and dominance to young girls, charmed and enthralled by the glamorized and wholly unreal Christian Grey ever going to be taken advantage of by older, predatorily type males? What type of message does this source material and film send women who are naive, submissive, innocent and easily charmed by the erotically charged notion of rich men with high brow toys being able to get away with anything they want? Violence, language and difficult subject matters are always at the forefront of rating controversy, yet this film was easily given an R rating, when it's message is one that needs to be taken seriously and cautiously, especially for young women."

Grey doesn't do love and romance so to even consider it is awkward for him and you could see the chemistry slowly build as he warmed up to the idea of having a relationship.

","When the sexually naive Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) interviews billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dorman) as a favour for her friend, sparks begin to fly. Christian begins to woo her by initially sending her expensive gifts and creepily stalking her. Eventually they get together and Christian tells her he has 'singular tastes'. Mmm, what could that mean? It's a bit of an understatement to say that Christian likes a bit of bondage and he wants to be a dominant to Anastasias Submissive. Ana appears reluctant at first but soon gives in to the charms of Christian. The sex scenes get more uncomfortable as it becomes increasingly obvious Ana is getting scarred, both physically and emotionally. The film is an adaptation of the book by E.L James and luckily she didn't write the screenplay. I'm saying this as I tried to read the book and managed just five chapters as it was such a badly written and tedious read. So kudos to director Sam Taylor-Johnson for making a decent attempt at it, showing you almost can polish a turd. The female side of me loves a bit of romance but I like it with a bit less violence. In one scene Christian really whips Ana hard and she looks visibly upset but he carries on regardless. It's a very selfish relationship and I don't see what Ana gets from it. Is the name Grey being ironic? OK, he's handsome, he can play the piano and fly a helicopter but he's so dull. Throughout the film all I could think was, ""Ana, what first attracted you to billionaire Christian Grey?"" I'm broadminded but the contract he tries to get Ana to sign quite shocked me, it's far too explicit for me to write the details here. Dakota Johnson as Ana is one shining light in the film, she's pretty and despite early reservations I think she was well cast. There isn't great chemistry between the leads but they try their best with the slim material they have to deal with. My favourite part is when Christian gets his chopper out (his helicopter, you dirty minded buggers) as the excellent Ellie Goulding track ""Love me like you do"" is played. The soundtrack deserves a mention, the music is better than the film deserves. I don't get the love for Christian Grey. I get that it's a fantasy but he's controlling, selfish and cold with few redeeming features (apart from him being a rich hunk, would he have the same attention if he was on job seekers allowance?) There is a decent romantic film in there somewhere and they did a much better job than I expected. I wasn't bored and found the relationship quite interesting but ultimately it left a nasty taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>Verdict: I'm damning with faint praise, it's far better than it could have been, fans of the book will love it."

The books was poorly written, and in my opinion, even Meyers did a better job writing than James did, yet both of their work was considered ""literature"" in the modern sense. Way too many details were left out of the movie, and the pacing of the scenes was just weird. In all, I think Jamie Dornan did a reasonably good job (surprisingly) at portraying Christian, but Dakota Johnson need a body language lesson. It was said the two main actors don't actually get on very well in real life, and it really carried over into the film, because the chemistry was absent to make the D/S dynamic of the scenes work. On top of that, there were way too many Ana & Christian scenes in it, so much the other characters were more like they are making cameo appearances than anything else. There were few movies out there that I could not sit through to the end, and I was very tempted to walk out of this one. I did not go into the theatre with high expectation, and how right I was."

I think it was interesting, enticing, thrilling, climatic( in more than one way) and overall I found it a good movie with a good plot. It wasn't just sexual scenes, there was a plot between 2 lovers. With every movie targeted towards female viewers. I think people should stop to see who the movie is targeted to, and not just look at the characters, and the plot line. It keeps you on the edge wondering what will happen, and the ending is very cringing, because I need to know what happens next. The end was very similar to the end of the hunger games.

Both actors were great (yes great) and Sam made a beautiful film. I do think it was a tad bit rushed and could have been extended about 15 or 20 minutes to add a few more minor things. For me, the sex scenes and nudity were very tastefully done. It is not porn for crying out loud. Were there some cheesy lines? Of course. Is it going to win Oscars and receive critical acclaim? No. People giving it a 1/10 and dubbing it the worst movie ever clearly haven't seen very many movies. I think far more people liked it and don't want to admit it."

","Okay so I read all three of the books. I read the first book numerous of times, I love it! My problem with the film is the little details that are in the book should have been put into the movie. When I first seen the film, I was kind of confused. Another problem I have, is with the other cast members. It was as though they shied away from them, when they had a great deal in the book too. Instead of skipping sex scenes I think they could've been incorporated into the film better. It was a little (corny) I guess you could say, just a little. When I watched it the first time I was very upset it was absolutely dreadful to me. Seriously I think I was cringing in the theater . But I watched it again and I can say it's better. When I first seen the film I would have rated it about a 2-2.6. Yes! But I watched it again and I would give it about a 5 round to a 6.2 I guess my problem was, I expected the film to be much like the book, and expectations leads to disappointments. So I tried watching it in another perspective. and I like it, I don't hate it like I had before. It's one of those movies you have to have an open mind to.

"hunguk20","2","2","6","17 February 2015"," Huge opportunity missed out on by Director and Cast
","So first things first Mr Grey. He was cast completely wrong. He lacked in darkness and mystery which he is shrouded in in the book. He failed to portray the intensity that the character required and there was no real connection between him and Anastasia in the majority of the film. Parts he did well, was the wounded lost boy look he gave towards Anastasia near the end after a moment of rejection from her. He also managed to capture a bit of frustration in that section quite well too. Bad parts the rest really. He should have been much more dominant, in control, trying to maintain his cold demeanour whilst relenting bit by bit as his love and desire for Anastasia outweighed his broken past and need for distance from emotion. He needed to encapsulate Anastasia 100% taking in the audience with him from the start but this was not the case. <br/><br/>Anastasia definitely had the vulnerable look about her and portrayed that visually quite well a few times throughout by luck of her natural look as opposed to acting but the conversion from book to film script was poor and she lacked depth or believability in her desire for him or any emotion at all other than reading from a script in the majority of the film. <br/><br/>Taylor not great casting but not in it much anyway and Christians mum was OK ish, her mum was cast well and so was her dad. Her flat mate was cast badly and a bad actor in general so many female actresses could have got the flat mate so right it's confusing how they got it so wrong. Right sex scenes. Don't make something an 18 and advertise it as serious sex scenes when really it's pretty much all tame and romanticised up rather than being the hard raw lustful passionate sex it was supposed to be. The music during these scenes made me feel I was in church watching a coronation not a red room of pain. Also the punishment scene was just cringe-worthy and failed to actually deliver the message that she wanted him to feel the rejection after doing that to her that she felt about not being able to touch him. There was so much depth that could have been achieved in this area. They could have also got across why she was so willing to allow him to do these things to her. Also considering he never usually does romance that should have been clawed out of him or at least spontaneously given in a moment of passion or in order to stop her leaving to show that her power over him was strong too. <br/><br/>Basically I wanted to feel the chemistry, the pull they had for each other and the build up from her being introduced to something new and different but not necessarily bad and with rewards for her as well as him when done in the right way. Instead I got a virgin girl supposedly waiting for Mr right and that Mr right being someone who wants to hurt her and dominate her and punish her which is completely against what she wanted in a man and that is not what the book portrays in my opinion she should have felt it was completely wrong but went there anyway due to how he made her feel but the complete lack of chemistry failed to make that appear plausible throughout. <br/><br/>With the right cast, script, director and music it could have been an epic love story achieved through hard lustful sex whilst breaking down emotional barriers on one side and nativity and ignorance on the other to meet in the middle but it did not deliver anywhere close to achieving this in its current format. <br/><br/>I give it a 2/10"

They left out the key relationships that helped to give the characters life like Kate, Ana and Jose's relationship. Sometimes the character of Kate pushed buttons and said things that helped Ana discover things. She's her protective girl friend I missed that interaction. It lacked that little stuff.

It has all been done very tastefully :). Some of the scenes in my opinion were slightly too long but overall a great film. The soundtrack is amazing especially Ellie Goulding's love me like you do. Before you knock it go and watch it for yourself."

","I read all three books way back when they came out, and whilst I enjoyed them, they were incredibly cringe and laughable because no one would ever say or think what Anastasia had. <br/><br/>Jamie Dornan was exactly how I pictured Christian Grey to be, however, sometimes I couldn't tell if he was acting or if he was just a bit awkward. Dakota Johnson, however, was fantastic and kept me hooked. She made Anastasia just as an interesting as Christian which is important. I kept getting annoyed with her in the books because she was just so dull and couldn't stick up for herself.<br/><br/>The directors/writers changed Anastasia a little, which I liked. She was able to stick up for herself and didn't back down on what she wanted, for example, when she sternly told Christian NO and crossed out part of the contract. Many people seem to think this series is abusive, and this film shows the complete opposite which is fantastic. <br/><br/>People had this film really over hyped and i believe that is part of the issue and all the negative reviews. The only issue I had with this was the ending. The exact same lines could have worked if it didn't feel rushed which it did. Some continuity was poor, and the direction was flawed in places. By no means is this film perfect, but it's not offensively awful either."
"joe_bowers577@hotmail.com","7","2","6","15 February 2015"," Not as bad as people are saying
","I give the overall movie a MEH+ rating, however I think this movie was saved by the girl playing Anastasia, Dakota Johnson.<br/><br/>I saw it with my wife for Valentines day on a double date with our gaming friends. I went into it thinking it was going to be the worst 2.5 hrs of my life, especially after seeing the low rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It wasn't that bad. <br/><br/>My wife said that Anastasia was supposed to be homely and the main guy Christian was supposed to be super hot and out of her league. Well, the actress playing her was hard 10 ( I mean, come on, Don Johnson and Melanie Griffiths daughter isn't going to be hot?) , so the story of how easily he got into her pants didn't make much sense. And I could give or take all the sex scenes, they didn't help nor hurt the movie. <br/><br/>However there was some excellent acting, especially on the part of Dakota and you could really empathize with the girl and could tell she had strong feelings for Christian. Most of the dialogue was forgettable, but several of the scenes stick in your mind. My wife had read the books and hated the movie because of all the stuff she said was missing from the film. It didn't seem like anything was quickly glossed over from a non-readers standpoint, so I would say that didn't affect the movie. <br/><br/>If this movie did nothing other than introduce the world to the acting of Dakota Johnson, I say good enough for me."

It also seemed rushed, certain scenes seemed like they came and went way faster than in the book ( I understand you cant make every scene exactly like the book) but yeah it was just rushed. Im hoping in the next film adaptations when ""Christian"" starts to open up more that it won't seem as awkward. Other than that I enjoyed the movie!"
"cashbacher","8","1","2","19 March 2020"," A Cinderella tale that has kinky twists
","While this is a remake of the Cinderella plot, it has some literal and figurative kinky twists. Christian Grey is a very wealthy and attractive young man that trolls the world for women that will satisfy his desires. Anastasia (Anna) Steele is a college student given the task of interviewing the reclusive Grey, something that few have done. Grey is so secretive that the public does not know whether he is gay or straight.
There is a bit of a spark during the interview and they begin a relationship based on a contract written by Grey where Anna is designated as the submissive. For Grey has a difficult time with relationships with women and he is most comfortable when there is an underlying current of S & M with him in charge.
Yet, there is a spark of feeling between them that complicates his world and at first simplifies hers. With his vast wealth, Grey can provide experiences and buy things that Anna could only dream about before. Their relationship remains one of active sex, yet with an undercurrent of tension that can potentially destroy what they have together. It has the potential to burst into a happy ending where they fall into each other's arms in the implied happy ever after final scene.
The movie has some very powerful emotional moments, yet most are unpleasant for one or both of them. At times you feel for Grey and other times you hope that he bangs a knee against a table leg. It is a complex story that in many ways is a more realistic depiction of the Cinderella fantasy."

If for a minute I can remotely consider this to be art, then if this movie is supposed to represent some aspect of contemporary life, then I ask myself how things got here? I think this movie was wildly popular, particularly with women. Symbolically then, this disappoints me as I could find nothing endearing about it at all. How is it that this is popular? Am I out of step or does this fantasy appeal to so many in life? Is there anything of a higher order that people can turn to instead? I can't remember if I even bothered to watch it all the way to the end. I think in my mind I am trying to wipe out any interest I have or may have had with this.

","Though a few years late in viewing this immensely popular film and not having read E.L. James series of novels on dominant and submissive sexual experiences, the 'better late than never' applies. No, this is not a 'great movie' but as adapted for the screen by Kelly Marcel it is entertaining (though a bit long) and it is cast with credible appearing characters (the central focus couple spends the better part of the 125 minute film without clothes and pushing the usual standards of X rated to the limits - almost). Sam Taylor - Johnson, the British female director manages the situation well. <br/><br/>Shy literature student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) rooms with the worldly Kate (Eloise Mumford) and goes to interview the wealthy Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) as a favor to Kate who is to interview Grey for the school paper. She encounters a beautiful, brilliant and intimidating man. The innocent and naive Ana starts to realize she wants him. Despite his enigmatic reserve and advice, she finds herself desperate to get close to him. Not able to resist Ana's beauty and independent spirit, Christian Grey admits he wants her too, but on his own terms. Ana hesitates as she discovers the singular tastes of Christian Grey - despite the embellishments of success, his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, and his loving family, Grey is consumed by the need to control everything. He gradually introduces (? seduces) into the realm of submission and dominance - and the film ends with a cliffhanger that guarantees the continuation of James' novel. <br/><br/>Johnson and Dornan have fine chemistry and make the affaire noir credible. The others in the cast who contribute well are Jennifer Ehle (Ana's mother), Marcia Gay Harden (Christian's mother) and bit parts by Victor Rasuk, Max Martin and Luke Grimes among others.<br/><br/>Be prepared for a lot of visual body contact - but of course everyone knows the story and its reason for being because of all the flutter about James' novels."

The story based on the first part of the popular erotic trilogy ¬´Fifty shades of Grey¬ª. which is written by E.L.James. The main characters are played by Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan. 
The plot is extremely passionate and fascinating. Young women fall in love with a mad businessman, who has problems with aggression and doesn't trust people. Anastasia want help him, but she must make an effort to do this.
The film is worse than book because of the fact that script isn't written by E.L.James, but the cast is excellent. Leading actors play completely realistic, especially in sexual scenes. 
I would recommend it because the story is truly interesting and if you didn't watch it, you wouldn't understand the sequel, which's script is written be E.L.James and it's fantastic. To sum up i want to say that Fifty shades of Grey was a box-office hit."

"yelian-64428","8","1","2","26 June 2017"," I can relate to the girl, but can't understand the man
","I heard friends' spoilers about the movie and thought the story was awful, and I thought I would be much smarter if I were in such a situation.<br/><br/>Recently I watched the film, and I take back my words. I can now understand why two of my friends (one girl and one guy in their late 20s) told me it was plotted in such a natural way and things looked normal in that situation.<br/><br/>The woman was spotted by the guy for a reason. She looked intimidated and submissive in the first few encounters. She admires him. She is attractive. These gave him the wrong impression that she can be used as his sexual slave. Hence the contract and everything that has nothing to do with love were brought into the scene at the early stage, and their relationship was based on simply sex and probably material rewards, not much to the girl's satisfaction.<br/><br/>She knew it was dangerous but she was also attracted to him, maybe in her heart she likes to be the submissive, to a certain extent. His pursuit has been contradictory which makes her want to know more. There were multiple times she retreated, but the sweeteners he gave (imagine how many girls have been taken onto airplane journeys by their dates), his persistent pursuit and the nearly overwhelming care have melted her. And not to forget, he did give her a romantic first night. For him, it was simply to ""rectify the situation"", but for her, he was the first guy she has ever wanted to have a romance with. She was led on by desire but their relationship seemed to went too far on sex but not on other aspects. I knew it will die soon. <br/><br/>Interestingly, despite the man had shown it clear at the beginning that he does not do romance, his feelings for her grew deeper and her refusals at certain points have wakened him up to realize he wanted to fight for her. It is not easy at all. Considering his history of being sexually abused by an older woman who even became his friend, sexual abuse was considered normal and enjoyable to him, so their conflicts are intensified as their relationship became acknowledged by people around them before themselves even knew where they were.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a relationship based on physical attraction later became serious and problems got intensified. I relate to this girl strongly that when a young girl is innocent, curious and loving, she would not know what it means and how it feels to be with this seemingly perfect guy without trying. When she tried to say no it was also difficult because he did not give her a break and he looked perfect by other people's eyes. On the other hand, it was a bit hard to understand the man, partly because the long abusive sexual relationship he had in his childhood. The male actor did not make the character stand out probably also because the role is hard for him to relate to."

Just two people who try to date and know they shouldn't but they try to make it work and it doesn't.<br/><br/>There is no chemistry between the leads. Jamie Dornan looked so miserable and was wooden but Dakota Johnson at least tried. <br/><br/>One positive of the film is Sam Taylor-Wood direction. She took a lot of heat for the film but she did the best she could with the material given. <br/><br/>My biggest problems are the portrayal of Christian and Ana. <br/><br/>Christian is a creep who enjoys having sex and beating women who look like his birth mother and kind of just blames it on his childhood. He stalks, tracks Ana's phone, tells Ana what to eat and controls her. Christian's child molester, ""Mrs. Robinson"" doesn't face any consequences.<br/><br/>Ana thinks she can change Christian and at the end of the film, gets mad at him and then leaves even though she knows what he wants and what he's going to do. <br/><br/>Romance doesn't cure an abusive relationship and I hate how it's portrayed as a fairy-tale. <br/><br/>Kind of feels the author of the book hates women and doesn't know a thing about men."

I did not feel the male lead sold his character that well. Overall, he was pretty to look at but did not convey the right carnal energy to make us believe he has something going for him other than his good looks and MONEY.

There is no chemistry between them, no passion and no emotion, about the whole master / slave thing. They try so hard to get into their roles, they want it so much, they do everything they were told in the acting class but they don't succeed. Then the photography - so dump explicit, no space for fantasy no lust to explore the bodies, you see a lot of breasts, nipples and butts, but shown so inflationary it loses any attractiveness. And here's the main thing, there's no lust to explore the minds of the protagonists, the human mind as a whole, just dump explicitness that leads to the silliest and most predictable dialogues in movie history. No attempt to make the protagonists naked in a metaphorical way, No real dark corners and bad sides, no risk to harm their perfect look in any way. The ""bad"" is just shown as a fancy game. So many ways to tell a story about power and weakness, victories and struggles, self esteem, addiction and so on were ignored. Watching this movie soon makes arise a big question.

GREY WILL SEE YOU NOW Hello Kiddies your pal the Cupid Critic here and you know what I hate? Try mixing Twilight with porn, it equals crap, now make that crap into a movie and you get something much worse, this movie. This film is based off the popular novel by E.L James which was started as a twilight fan-fiction, turned into a novel, became a best seller somehow and now its one of the worst movies of this year. But guess what, it's made money so were going to have to sit through the next two sequels that will probably be made. The film is about Anastasia Steele, who does an interview for her friend Kate who is sick but after Ana comes back from the interview she feels better miraculously for some reason. Ana has to interview Christian Grey who is a young and very successful billionaire. She has the hots for him for some reason and is being asked to sign up to be his submissive to explore her sexual side. The film has the goal of appealing to it's demographic, I am not among that demographic but as film that is meant to have meaning, or be enjoyable, or fun even it most certainly does not succeed. All the characters feel like one dimensional real-world twilight characters. You got the female lead who is in love with the tough guy who is dangerous for her, you've got the completely different friend/roommate, and good friend who is in love her which sets up the love triangle. You probably want to know what I thought about the BDSM sex scenes, their there and I was not aroused. They are just filler and a plot device to tell this story, your girl might take you to see this but will make you delete your porn history. The acting in the film is alright from Dakota Johnson, I feel she could be doing better if the dialogue wan't so horrible. The direction is actually kind of good too.

Turns out the shady Christian Grey has a playroom full of S&M equipment and asks his latest conquest to enter into a contractual agreement for her to be his submissive sex partner. Adaptation of E.L. James' bestseller seems a little white bread from the outset: she happens to work in a hardware store, he comes in to buy tape and rope (!); he says he doesn't 'do' romance, yet there is an awful lot of kissing and canoodling and pillow talk (set to a soulful soundtrack); she asks for a contractual meeting (with a wink) to tell him of the sexual things she absolutely will not do (no anal or vaginal fisting for our heroine). This derivative, glossy movie hedges its bets, wanting to shock and titillate viewers while at the same time make the sex games as palatable as possible to seem romantic. Unfortunately, in a set-up like this one, there's really nowhere for the narrative to go once the action moves into and out of the bedroom. There are no surprise twists. Dakota Johnson asks Jamie Dornan to punish her because she's breaking the rules by wanting more from the relationship than he can give her; he obliges, she submits and they both end up feeling lousy.

To start this off, If you have read the book to which this picture is based on then you know what you are in for and it should not come as a surprise. This was not a good picture, as I anticipated it was going to be bad, I was right. So let's move one and get this over with, shall we? Millions of woman have bought into this pop-phenomenon and I can't figure out why. It's brainless and it does and shows what ""Showgirls"" did to expose women and make them look like foolish sex-toys. Anastasia is the muse for this as she is whipped and what looks like, ""abused,"" for most of the picture. How does she not have any clues? She proceeds to act like an innocent victim by constantly biting her lip even after she falls through Christian's office door, just before she meets him for the first time.<br/><br/>Surprisingly there is very little erotic scenes and it takes up very little of the picture's running time. Instead, we are given poorly written dialogue about Christian's bad past and why he does what he does. None of it is a justice and he comes off as more of a predator than anything. He brings multiple women to his high-rise penthouse and strings them up. It's strange because he tells Anastasia that she is not the first and it makes you wonder what it is he sees in her. After thinking about it for more than 10 seconds, we really don't care and the story moves on to a yawn here and another yawn there.<br/><br/>Michale de Luca produces this picture and Sam-Taylor Johnson (wife of ""Kick Ass"", Aaron-Taylor Johnson), directs it. Who knew she was a director or had any talent behind the camera before this? She didn't and it shows because there is not much to show for it. It's pretty sad when scenes involving butter, (Last Tango in Paris), are more amusing than anything this picture has to offer. Consider the deflowering scene. Ana tells him she is a virgin and he proceeds to ""take her"" anyway. Before this, he tells her he doesn't ""love"" any woman. But that's okay for him to lie to her just so he can get his way and do what he wants.<br/><br/>There is no real effort here to make a good picture or tell a good story. The nudity is deceitful and not what anyone is going to expect: a shot of pubic hair here and a buttcrack there and of course, Johnson's nipples on display. What really gets me is how stupid Anastasia comes off as. She is supposed to be bright but she is laughable stupid. She acts like she hasn't a clue about anything nor does she ever say the right thing. Instead, she bites her lip again whenever Grey says something or whenever something is about to happen. There is a disturbing sequence in the film where Christian gets mad at her for ""talking"". His natural control freak means is to forcefully bend her over his knee, bring down her underwear and proceed to spank her. I found this humiliating and yet, she proceeds to bite her lip to no end.<br/><br/>We all know there is going to be a sequel to this, ""Fifty Shades Darker"". I hope and pray the day does not come soon where I have to review the second title. This one was awkward and painful enough to get through. One thing that stands out is how mature the theme is and it is NOT for kids or teenagers at all. For the little half of ""erotic"" it shows, the theme makes it more intense."

However, the exaggerated acting, tacky scenery, and weird inconsistent sequence of events did not make it any easier to convey the story properly.

","After hilarity Jupiter Ascending was, we get these few weeks later. This movie isn't as horrible as Jupiter Ascending, but it's far from being good. But still, what would you expect from an even more hilarious book?<br/><br/>I'll admit, the trailers were pretty good with a cool soundtrack and it actually looked promising and exciting in some parts, but no. There are 5 or 6, I can't remember, really short sex scenes with really toned down nudity and no one will be satisfied with them. For guys, Dakota Johnson just isn't attractive enough and for girls, they won't see Jamie Dornan's junk and end up being disappointing. I'm aware that this isn't a porno and wasn't supposed to be, but it could be a little more juicy because that's kinda the reason everyone went to see this movie and regretted it. The plot is very faithful to the book and considering that nothing really interesting happens in the first book aside from all that sex, this movie will probably be boring to you. But, like Jupiter Ascending, you can watch it with your friends and laugh at it. The cringe-worthy acting and writing are so bad it's hilarious. Okay, the actors weren't THAT horrible. They did what they could, but the script was awful and that's the main problem. The blame for that is probably on E.L. James because she was given too much freedom on set and you could even say it was written and directed by her.<br/><br/>Sam Taylor Johnson did a decent job as far as she could and the movie is actually very well shot and the soundtrack and score fit the movie very well. But, Danny Elfman, what are you doing here? You deserve so much movies that are better than this. They must have promised him a lot of money. But at least he gave the movie one more positive side.<br/><br/>I'm not calling this movie a complete garbage, it does have very few good sides, but it's still fun when you watch it with your friends and laugh your a*s off, but it's just lame. Maybe the sequel will be better and less embarrassing because more stuff happens and everything, but we will see."

Just to take a step back a bit, I didn't actually watch the whole movie; unless you consider watching less than 20 minutes as having watched it. The reason is simply, it was just too much of a torture. Jamie Dornan's character tries too hard to be cool and that is not just uncool but nauseating. But to top that, Dakota Johnson's Anastasia actually falls for it - nausea to the power of 10.

The premise of this film sees an average girl become infatuated with a billionaire playboy with a weird hobby. Now dakota johnson plays Anastasia steele and she is the only real positive in this film because she is okay in this film. She delivers a somewhat decent performance but her character is so boring in this film and has absolutely nothing special about her. Jamie dornan plays Christian grey and this is one of the most boring dislikeable people I have seen in film. These two's chemistry is just never there and it really makes this film painful to watch. The rest of the characters are obsolete and completely pointless to the whole story. The story is just bad, this is a love story but the problem is that there is no romance and no chemistry between the two characters. Also the film ends abruptly with no payoff so you really wonder why you even bothered. The script is awful with the dialogue being cringeworthy and really hard to believe. The style of the film is pretty racy, there is allot of sex in this film but you can find that on the internet for free. Overall this is a film you really don't need to see and you should definitely avoid at all costs."
"tomsview","6","1","2","28 November 2015"," Lars von Trier on Valium
","Firstly let me say that this film was both better and worse than I thought it would be. Although I haven't read the book, the hype about the movie created expectations.<br/><br/>Of course the whole thing is about power. When uber wealthy Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) meets wide-eyed innocent Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), the film starts out as a very straightforward romance, the kind that get a couple of showings on the Universal Channel. However things soon get twisted when it is revealed that Christian is a man with particular appetites.<br/><br/>He seduces her into a world of sadomasochistic bondage with her as the bonded. As the story proceeds, Christian gets into the swing of things and ramps up the punishment.<br/><br/>Of course if Christian had been a balding, sweaty middle-aged man with a weight problem, Anastasia may have needed a lot more seducing, but as she begins to fall in love with the handsome, cultivated Christian she willingly gives him her trust and compliance.<br/><br/>To be honest, I didn't find the film all that erotic ‚Äì it's too posed and contrived, and Christian's workroom looks a bit like a lavish display for adult toys in a department store window.<br/><br/>Where I found the film compelling was the way Anastasia, who for all intents and purposes is the powerless party, eventually gains all the power as Christian starts to have more genuine feelings for her. Of course that was obviously the intention of the filmmakers, because it is the only thing that stops the film from being just a soft-core exercise along the lines of ""Red Shoe Diaries"".<br/><br/>There is a fair bit of nudity in the film although it is rather sanitised ‚Äì just as well they didn't let a Ken Russell or a Lars von Trier anywhere near it.<br/><br/>Like many people, I was intrigued to see how they would make a mainstream movie out of this. In some places the story is decidedly vacuous ‚Äì just check out the names. It also has little humour, other than a couple of references to cable ties.<br/><br/>But at the very end, it has that telling scene where Anastasia leaves, presumably a wiser and stronger woman, while Christian is left with the choice of becoming a more empathetic and feeling man or continuing to satisfy desires that will lead to an unfulfilled life.<br/><br/>A powerful ending I didn't see coming. I hope they don't screw it up with all the sequels that are planned."

I waited the entire movie to witness the sadism. To my dismay, nothing.. Nothing in this movie was in any nature sadistic. In my opinion this movie was worse then the Late Night ""B"" rated movies on Cinemax, or Worse yet the old Late night ""USA UP ALL NIGHT"" so called Sexualy Explicit movies. Just because this movie shows some breasts, the implication of fully naked bodies, and a peek of hairy male genitalia, which by the way I find repulsive, by no means makes it worthy of any exciting review or trailer..

","Fifty Shades of Grey (2015): Dir: Sam Taylor-Johnson / Cast: Dakota Johnson, Jamie Dornan, Eloise Mumford, Victor Rasuk, Marcia Gay Harden: Erotic film that dives deep within the lifestyles of hardcore bondage and sadistic sexual play. Based on the trilogy of popular novels of the same name, Jamie Dornan plays young wealthy Christian Grey, and Dakota Johnson plays Anastasia Steele, a college student who interviews him when her roommate was unable to. The interview leaves Grey curios of her innocence and he makes an appearance at the hardware store she works at. This leads to a hook up where he states that he doesn't do romance. She is shocked when he unlocks a secret door in his mansion to reveal the Red Room, which consists of whips, chains, handcuffs, floggers, and various other devices used for hardcore sexual activity. Similar to the equally erotic 9 ¬Ω Weeks, director Sam Taylor-Johnson highlights with great uses of gray, white, black, and particularly red, with effective slow motion during a climatic flogging sequence. Starts out well but after the Red Room is introduced then the sex scenes become repetitious. The ending is similar to 9 ¬Ω Weeks with the close of an elevator door conveying an exhaust of patience in the face of emotional endurance. Dornan plays Grey as someone bland, unreadable, and unsympathetic in his creepy demeanor. Johnson bravely plays off the shock effect of the sadism she is introduced to and endures its worst. Supporting roles by Eloise Mumford as her roommate and Marcia Gay Harden as Mrs. Grey are cardboard. Sexual activity can be created or it can reach a gray area of question. Score: 6 ¬Ω / 10"

","Let me assure long time readers of my IMDb user comments that I didn't pay to see this movie - I waited until I could get the Blu- ray from my local library for free. And I certainly wasn't wanting to watch it from a serious viewpoint - I had heard from some sources that it was unintentionally funny. Sad to say, though there was indeed some dopey dialogue and situations, there isn't much unintended humor to be found here. That's not to say that the movie is pretty good, however. There are many problems to be found with this story, but I think the biggest was that I simply couldn't believe that this particular female protagonist would fall for the charms (and kinks) of the character of Christian Grey. At least how it's portrayed here - her being seduced happens WAY fast. Just as flawed is that the movie doesn't seem to have a point or moral - the movie ends in a way that had me thinking, ""Just what was the purpose of what I saw?"" Oh, I guess the filmmakers were trying simply to be erotic and kinky, but to be honest, I didn't find the sex, nudity, and kinks terribly erotic - they come across as too staged and unnatural. (And women viewers will probably also object to the fact that there's not much male nudity on display here.) The one bit of merit to be found in the movie is that director Sam Taylor-Johnson does capture the cold and gloom of Seattle pretty well, and that does add some effective atmosphere in the background."

","I haven't read the books and i don't think i am going to. Not one of the fans. That said , i just watched the film and it wasn't bad. <br/><br/>Its sort of a mix Pretty woman / American Psycho / 9 1/2 weeks into a modern type of film.<br/><br/>The lead actors weren't exactly extra-ordinary , but they were pretty good in their roles. They say there was no chemistry , well i detected some chemistry between them , there was a vibe accomplished. Maybe there was room for even more chemistry , better bond , better vibe , but i think it's biased and stubborn to say there was no chemistry.<br/><br/>The direction was decent. Nice aerial shots to set the mainstream mood , and relaxing for the eye. <br/><br/>The thing i liked most about the direction of the film , was that the sex scenes had a progressiveness , taking it step by step. So that in every scene , the audience is prepared for that level of progression. You get used to it , because it has been built up. It wasn't too sudden. Maybe this credit needs to be given to the screenwriter and not the director , maybe to both of them.<br/><br/>From what i had been hearing about this film , i was expecting way more intense extremities surrounding the sexual relationship of the two leads. <br/><br/>It isn't that much extreme. At least what it actually shows. The main flaw of this film for me , was that it didn't evolve a lot. Its more like a chart of a straight line with a few small bumps. <br/><br/>Its not a line that goes uphill and downhill with a lot of harsh , sudden bumps. <br/><br/>Meaning , nothing really intense happens throughout the whole film. Which is pretty bad, if its true , for any film. <br/><br/>And thats just what this film impressed on me. It didn't raise the stakes much. It gave us a taste , but it didn't go for it. We took a tour and it ends.<br/><br/>Still nice cinematography , and nice music ( but could be better). Its not a bad film to watch on a rainy night , when you're bored and can't think of any other film to watch. <br/><br/>Its watchable."

Now I like the movie because I love the book and the story but the movie in itself is just bad. The best way I can put the biggest problem in this movie is that instead of a continuous line, the story line feels like a continuous one. Like different pieces of a puzzle glued together by force not because they fit. I think it just suffered from a problem of bad directing. Also I love the soundtrack, but it is incomplete. There are just to many parts of the movie where you just listen to them talk and in the best part of those, I believe that an original score would have been for the best. Perhaps even necessary.

"arabelafabre","5","1","2","18 February 2015"," Only my opinion
","I like to leave my opinion that is just that: an opinion. It is not a criticism or a judgment, I'm not a specialist. About the books: I read all three. The first is my favorite. I do not consider either pornographic or erotic. I don't think CG is a dominant, instead is a control freak with singular tastes that help him to release his wounds (as the result of a difficult childhood, he has the need to control emotions and situations just to feel safe). He's a man with a lack of self-love and therefore he doesn't accept that someone can love him unconditionally. AS is a romantic girl but not naive. She's just waiting for real love. And surrenders to it, even when she discovers a whole world of less common sexual practices. It is therefore a love story. It has delicious seduction games, some fascinating dialogues. But that's all that is: a wonderful love story. About the movie: I expected so much more. I think it is a screenplay error. I believe that were left out scenes and dialogues which, would be relevant to the viewer (including those o didn't read the books) and could capture the intensity of the relationship between them. I think JD and DJ did the best they could with an unappetizing script. I had never seen DJ acting, but i think thought she is a promising actress. JD is phenomenal: his facial expressions of sometimes despair, sometimes charm, sometimes cold, sometimes free (when he heats ana at the end). (Please watch The Fall, one of the best series in last years, and you'll see what a great actor he is). I think Sam Taylor-Johnson did a god job and i enjoyed the soundtrack. Unfortunately, i believe this movie is the product of bad script; but fortunately it is a box office hit."

It is an untraditional love story with a twist. Jamie Dornan is Gorgeous! I don't care if he is from Northern Ireland. He is a former Calvin Klein Model, Calvin knows how to pick them. Jamie has leading man traditional good looks. He is a HUNK, just fine as wine I didn't know he was from Ireland, I didn't see he was having a hard time with his American accent. He has work on American TV ""Once Upon a Time"" 1st. season Det. Graham. Dakota was perfect. It is a woman's story written, by women, directed by a woman. It was E.L James Fantasy. It is FICTION. In fiction it doesn't have to be true facts. It can be however you want it to be. Your fantasy what is it the BDSM people don't get.<br/><br/>I gave it an 8 because of the dialog in the opening scenes. Kate ask Ana was she wearing that? Her response was dumb. Ana not being able to state her name to the receptionist when she arrives for the interview. In the book she did. For all you Haters who thought it was raunchy where, it was done very tastefully, I seen worst sex scene. For all of you who were mad because it wasn't enough sex, well with all the sex in the book it would have been X rated. Hollywood is not going to show a B-job or women on their period, along with some of the other nasty things Christian did in the book. I saw the movie without reading the book/s. Then I went an got the book, then went back and saw the movie again. Then got Darker & Freed all in a 3wk period.<br/><br/>The love story is he was in love with her but couldn't admit it. People do what they know. They BOTH were a virgin. She a virgin in the traditional sense, he was a virgin to a normal healthy relationship. Hence the line ""Flowers & Chocolates I don't know that"" Christian said several times to Ana what are you doing to me"", It you that is changing me"". He was breaking his own rules for Ana. Anatasia being na√Øve an inexperience didn't realize it at first. She had him when she told him she was a virgin. Someone he thought he could train to be what & how he wanted. She fool him. ""No"" can be a powerful word to a man, specially to men who are used to getting what they want. She was mesmerized by is beauty and power that is a drug for most women. He gave her what she wanted at the same time wanting what he did (BDSM). She gave him that as much as she could take. He need total control, I think he was boarding on obsession/possession that is scary. He kept saying ""YOU ARE MINE"" like she was an object instead a human with feelings. She challenged and questioned him that was frustrating to him. Something he was not used to. ""50 shades of f...Up! But love comes. People who need control are scared. People who don't know how Hollywood works the basics. It takes an small army to make a movie, with the money and time constraint is why books are hard to adapt to film form. I think more of the dialog in the book could have been lifted straight from the book. Like the ending scene, she should have call him a Sick SOB like in the book. It would have been stronger and you see the change in Ana. Strength to stand up to him.<br/><br/>Traditional love story: boy meets girl, boy leaves girl, boy makes up with girl happy ending, most of the time. 50 shades was boy and girl meet, boy tells girl he is not the guy for her. then he pursues her, when she say nice knowing you, boy doesn't let her leave. He won't let go. ""I am incapable of leaving you alone His kryptonite LOVE!"

He is complicated , try giving Christian a thought, can you describe in just max 2-3 adjectives Impossible He is a man with several ingredients People who say , 'why would a girl agree to be with a man who is hurting her' see the care he does for her ! She bloody stays because its love ! A man who has done something all his life and it gives him immense pleasure forgets about it and changes for an average girl Guys open up and do the thinking again With a positive mind Its a book to ponder on and not skip pages which do not have sexual content !

"wayted","2","2","7","3 March 2015"," Fifty Shades of Vanilla
","Written by my sister, Alison: ""FIFTY SHADES OF VANILLA<br/><br/>Men who like to please their women should see FIFTY SHADES OF GREY. Women who like hot Irishmen and *think* they love being dominated in the sack should see it, too. While it's absolutely not the most erotic movie you'll ever see, it's better than its source material and much fun to see with gal-pals (like I did) or, I would think, your romance/sex partner.<br/><br/>The movie sucks because Christian Grey is such a Dom that he has not only a playroom well appointed with only the finest in (to be sure) bespoke leather sex toys, but also one of those airtight ""slave contracts."" Yet the movie wants us to believe that a grossly immature, unworldly, all-together average beauty makes him break his own contract and own rules, one by one, almost immediately after meeting her.<br/><br/>The Anastasia character tops from the bottom throughout the movie. This should be obvious to anyone who's even remotely read about or dabbled in BDSM. A master like Christian Grey would anticipate this and probably not be willing to let it happen. Basically, it wouldn't get him hard. But this is a movie for women who like their sexuality to be 97% vanilla, with just a sprinkle of kink. The movie is much tamer than I even thought it would be, and even in the sexual throes of getting it on. Christian uses a condom every single time. We even get to see that familiar intimate moment where the guy rips the condom wrapping open with his teeth and slaps on that sucker. The movie is just that responsible.<br/><br/>The movie sucks because Anastasia Steele is a virgin who, according to her own admission, hasn't even done ""other stuff."" This confession drives Christian Grey wild with desire for her. He even wonders at the thought that men must've been ""throwing themselves"" at her for years while she remained oblivious to her charms -- the chief charm being an obnoxious tendency to bite ""the pillow of her bottom lip"" (this is seriously what we called it at True Story, True Confessions, and the lot). The message seems clear: All those Cosmo articles are dead wrong. Guys don't want an experienced woman who knows and relishes her own sexuality. Guys want a virgin they can train with their main vein. Sloppy seconds are for suckers.<br/><br/>Mr. Grey pops Anastasia's cherry approximately three minutes after she fesses up to it. Then they do it in the missionary position, a.k.a.""the normal way"" the first time so she can develop a taste for it. You know -- because self-made business magnates have all sorts of extra time on their hands to be at a girl's beck and call, and tenderly tend to her innocent, blossoming needs and uncertainties. Every woman knows this guy; every woman has, at some time in her life, had to put up with an obscenely handsome, tycoon-level hot man who wants to spend all his time with her, cater to her every need, and possess her erotic and romantic life forever and ever and ever and ever. Yeah. Sure.<br/><br/>You see now why this is a perfect chick flick? Because it says this guy exists. He is out there, waiting for you and only you. You can dress dowdy, you can be dumber than a deflated blowup doll. No matter what, HE wants YOU. All of you. This is the idea that makes the movie a great flick for couples. Guys, if you want to know what many women want -- even just a little bit -- and make them all lust for your cashmere-scented Wong, watch this movie, take notes, and then act like Christian Grey for the rest of your life. In addition, please own and be able to fly your own helicopter. And if your new girlfriend wants to go visit her mother, don't take it for a much-needed break from the needy, nagging ball-and- chain -- secretly fly down there in your gorgeous weekend clothes and JUST SHOW UP while your lady and her mom are having brunch. This is super hot.<br/><br/>Sadly, the movie isn't super hot. You have to wait for just about the last 12 minutes of the flick to see even a remotely decent whipping, and it only lasts for six lashings. By his own admission, Christian Grey likes to ""fuck. Hard."", but from what we see, the dude doesn't have any amazing sexual skills. He's a two-minute brother and he begins every sexual encounter by getting down on his knees and kissing his way down Anastasia's belly on a lick trip to her nether. Seriously. If I were dating him, the minute he got down on his knees and started unbuttoning my jeans, I'd think, Guess we're gonna do it. And here we go again.... The movie traffics in that precise kind of cinematic shorthand. We know that Christian Grey is unbelievably wealthy -- not to mention meticulous -- because his penthouse is enormous and cold with lots of white marble flooring and all of that sparse modern furniture that all rich people love. By the same shorthand, it only takes a few seconds of back-story to establish what we figured: Anastasia's roommate is an earthy blonde who puts out on the first date. You know. That roommate""."
"dustyfairyza","7","2","7","19 February 2015"," Fifty Shades of a great beginning.
","Spoiler alert. Please stop reading if you haven't seen the movie or read the books. Fifty Shades of Grey was okay. How can anyone expect a great movie if you look at the source material? It is like watching a comedy and expecting a drama. <br/><br/>I have read all three books. And what I liked about the books was the brutal honesty. I would say in my opinion that, that is also why it is so popular. Readers are allowed to see Ana's most sacred thoughts without it being filtered or censored. The brutal honesty is what draws people to the story. I would conclude that this is also the reason why 'The Twilight saga', 'The Hunger Games series' and 'Divergent series' are so extremely popular. Fifty shades of Grey is no great literary achievement that will stand the test of time. Will we remember it in 10 years? No!!! <br/><br/>The movie stays quite close to the book. And I can't believe I am saying this, but I wish it didn't. The dialog between the characters were cringe worthy in the book, and even more so in the movie. The professional screenwriters hired to write the screenplay could have totally improved on the mediocre house wife vocabulary. And I expected more. <br/><br/>The beginning of the movie is a complete mess. The story was disjointed, and didn't gel at all. It felt like a badly acted high school play. Up until the bar scene, I was contemplating should I leave or stay. They should have re-shot all of those scenes and stuck to maybe 2 of 3 scenes, not so many mini scenes. Jumping from the apartment ‚Äì roommate is sick, to her driving to Seattle, to her entering Grey Enterprises, to the reception scene, then the interview (badly done, but a necessary scene), the elevator, returning to the apartment, the hardware store (liked this scene), the photo shoot, the hall scene, the coffee shop, the almost run over by a bike scene. Even going from Christian posing with Jose asking him to smile, and then the he asked me for coffee chat between the roommates were off. (Were these scenes even shot on the same day?), then writing her last exam, to Jose helping her to open her car door (random), opening the gift from Christian, to her roommate helping her apply lip-gloss. It's a mess okay.<br/><br/>Then the actual movie starts, and it goes from blah to entertaining. The rest is worth watching. Maybe skip the first 20 minutes of the movie. <br/><br/>The acting improves. The chemistry between Ana and Christian comes out of nowhere. This is where you realize the movie is about a girl meeting a broken man and deciding to fix him. She is maybe inexperienced, but any normal girl would run when they saw the Red Room, it looks like a torture chamber. When I read the books I imagined a room that had a bed, couch and a weird wall rack thingy. Everything else was in drawers, not on display, like a tool shed. I imagined a fancy dressing room type room, where everything was neatly packed away. Maybe I have selective comprehension when reading books like that. I was shocked, and was thinking ""RUN ANA RUN"". The biggest problem with this story is that it ended at the wrong place, nothing was resolved. In the second book Christian realizes that what he does to woman is wrong, and that becoming a submissive at the age of 16 was wrong. What that woman did, was psychological abuse. He came from an abusive childhood. He was physically abused before he was adopted. In his love for Ana he realizes that he was made into something, that wasn't who he really was. Ana teaches him intimacy. And love. And that is a really important part of the story. Without it, he just looks like a sadistic animal. The ""hiding"" he gives her is pretty tame. And I would never call that abuse. She was in control, one word and he would have stopped. She asked to see the extreme. In my opinion it didn't look like he enjoyed it. He felt her pain, and he witnessed the impact it had on someone he loved, and he realized that is was wrong."

","If you are a T & A fan, you will love this hokey-pokey movie. Lip-biting college babe meets the Commander of Cool (and Kinky). <br/><br/>Actor Jamie Dornan plays Christian Grey as a lifeless, wooden puppet who spouts the F-word a lot (no surprise in today's movies). Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele fares a bit better at playing one of the most eager and teachable virgins on record. No sparks here folks. If you went to see the sexy stuff think again--this movie actually plays amateurish, stiff, and porno-ish in a really laughable yet seedy way.<br/><br/>The 50 Shades Trilogy wasn't rich either, but this movie is about as tasteless and fat-free as it gets. Too bad Grey wasn't played by the producers' original choice--Charlie Hunnan (Jax from Sons of Anarchy,a blazing hot-toddy with one of the best ""A's"" ever) who chose to opt- out before production began."
"graupepillard","4","2","7","15 February 2015"," Love in the Time of Sadomasochism
","How often does one get to see a movie that uses paintings, etc. in the background (for me scene-stealers) by excellent artists including Gary Hume, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Ed Ruscha, Rob Pruitt, John Baldessari, Michael Joo among others? The reason being that Sam Taylor-Johnson (a respected British visual artist turned filmmaker, formerly known as Sam Taylor-Wood) is the Director of FIFTY SHADES OF GREY - the much maligned film (particularly by those who have not seen it) mainly for its exploration of a sadomasochism - dominant/submissive sexual relationship based on the best selling novel of the same name by E.L. James. <br/><br/>Not surprisingly the film is extremely stylish - beautifully photographed; yet too self- consciously ""framed,"" thereby creating a veneer of sleekness and glamour over the sweaty underbelly of an encounter between a lovely, naive young woman, Anastasia Steele (a luminous Dakota Johnson - lighting up the screen) and a wealthy young billionaire, Christopher Grey ( a miscast Jamie Dornan - whatever modeling he had done in the past for Calvin Klein is still in his DNA and needs to be flushed out.)<br/><br/>I am of the generation that read Pauline Reage's The Story of O, an erotic novel touting the ""release"" of one's ego through complete submission to another - ultimately O becomes a slave to sensuality. This film on the other hand with its ""sex-light"" couplings, soft lights, and deep lingering looks eschews ""romantic love, "" but nevertheless embraces it. <br/><br/>In essence this is a story about control and loss of control; purity/innocence ""corrupted""; in this case not underhandedly but rather straightforwardly, everything is laid out on the table in a written agreement. Anastasia willingly surrenders to Christopher's tastes stepping into a world of the flesh; dissecting pain and its relation to desire, delving into questions of what is considered ""normal"" intimacy between couples. The problem being that the script is too facile - what might have conveyed insight instead summoned laughter."

I can tell you ""9 1/2 weeks"" was far better considering it is a movie form later 80s if I am not mistaken. ""Basic instinct"" was better and even ""Eyes wide shut"" beat this movie by a large margin. It is not even sexy as I expected or naughty enough to cause some sort of ""activity"".

","First off, I have read the book about 20 times. Second, the movie moved really fast but that can be expected if you're trying to fit all of this book into a couple hours. Unfortunately, there was a lot missed, especially the little things. Ana and her job interview, Christian chasing her in the apartment, sex in the boathouse, and the entire relationship aspect between the two and a bunch of other things I won't list. It didn't show Christian as controlling and mercurial in the movie like he was in the book. Yes they could have done better, much better, but the movie is never as good as the book anyways, unless you've never read the book. If they will make a second movie - which I hope they do despite my disappointment in this first movie - they have the chance to redeem themselves. In my opinion, I've always thought the first book as boring, and the last two as more entertaining. If given the chance, they should continue and improve."
"newnoir","Null","2","7","14 February 2015"," O' Fifty Shades!
","In the spirit of Saint Valentine's Day, I bought into the hype and went to see the film Fifty Shades of Grey.<br/><br/>As someone once wrote, the ending was less a grand finale than a grand finally. Wooden acting, no full frontal nudity, sex scenes cut short. I can't remember the last time a major studio erotic film was released, and this doesn't bode well for a revival of the genre.<br/><br/>Some scenes worked, including some bondage scenes, yet you never feel fully engaged with the innocent female lead Anastasia or the mysterious young billionaire and S&M enthusiast Christian Grey.<br/><br/>My guess is the book was wall to wall sex, which is what made it readable despite the schlock value and the book's humble origins as Twilight fan fiction, the movie needed more of that, or a better screenplay and director."
"cheekybristolbrat","8","2","7","14 February 2015"," Better than the book but Dornan is better on the eye than he is on the ear!
","I've given this film 8 out of 10 as Dakota Johnson is a credit as Anastasia and the director has done an amazing job at making both Anastasia and Christian more witty, which appealed to my husband and I.<br/><br/>Several scenes were omitted from the book, or adapted. Some I felt should be in there, but the majority within good reason. I understand that the director fell out with E.L. James, but I think she did favourably to a book which is, at times, difficult to handle. There is less sex, far fewer emails, and no mention of that damned inner goddess. Hallelujah!<br/><br/>For the sakes of security, my next comment is kind of a spoiler.<br/><br/>without giving too much away, the end is a difficult pill to swallow. There is a lot of question about consent in the book, but this is beautifully enhanced in the film, with constant emphasis that nothing is signed and therefore Christian always asks Ana whether she wants whatever he has planned,if he trusts her etc. From someone who is ... umm... 'adventurous', I wouldn't say any of it is abusive. Several times Chrisstian asks Ana if she wants more. Whilst she doesn't say yes, she's not kicking and screaming, either. In what we do, one does not always say ""I am going to do X to you, do you want me to do that?"" Sometimes, all one needs to remember is safewords. In the scene which brings up questionable abuse, Ana is reminded of her safewords before it begins. Previously before, Christian tells her he's f**ked up, and Ana orders him to show her. In my opinion, to a degree she brought it on herself, and to not use her safeword is her own doing. HOWEVER, the 'Dominant' should always terminate a scene if he feels the 'submissive' is not handling it well, and for that reason I feel that leaves a bad taste in the mouth at the end of the film. He does so well for himself until that point, that is the point Christian stops being passionate, witty and intense and becomes a violent monster with a distinctive lack of self-control, which has it's consequences.<br/><br/>The sex scenes are hot, and aside the last kinky scene mentioned above, they are all erotic with hot sex. There is some nudity from both parties, but it is almost artistic nudity and sex. I personally feel that to define it as 'pornographic' would be wrong. It is carnal and intense, but not at all fast and animalistic. It is as it would be for two people who are unreserved with each other, intense, and passionate.<br/><br/>Sadly, I do feel that Dornan is a let down. Aesthetically, very pleasing! The way he saunters around in suits and ripped jeans? Well, 10 out of 10! But his voice? No pitch, no tone. He might as well of been reading the script off. We get it, he's supposed to be all emotionally screwed up, but what his face says and what his voice says are two entirely different things.<br/><br/>In all a good film, but Dornan distinctively lacks any spoken emotion in his role. He almost sounded like he'd rather be anywhere but filming a multi-billion dollar film."

","We all know the story. Nervous college student Anastassia Steele goes to interview billionaire Christian Grey after her flatmate gives her the job owing to having a bad cold. The interview doesn't go too well. The questions she asks are frankly lousy and she's too nervous and extremely uncertain around the rather good looking young man in his incredibly modern office. After being ushered out by him, they say goodbye at the elevator and Ana breathes a much needed sigh of relief.<br/><br/>Not long after, Grey visits her in the DIY store where she works on the precursor of buying DIY supplies. After several minutes of stumbling around and eyeing each other, Grey leaves but gives her his business card. <br/><br/>Ana then finishes her exams and accompanies her friend Kate on a drinking session out. During the course of it, Ana phones up Grey in a moment of drunken bravery and admonishes him for giving her a set of Thomas Hardy first editions. He questions her quite frankly about her drinking and then she hangs up. She then goes outside and finds herself the object of her photographer Jose's unwanted attentions, but Grey is there to save the day. <br/><br/>After all this, Ana finds herself waking up in a lovely hotel room being watched by a sweaty Grey. Again, he repeats his insistence that his tastes are rather singular but seems to be more drawn to her, this time, biting some of her toast in a playful manner. <br/><br/>Grey then agrees for her to come to his apartment for a 'date'. She is picked up after her work and whisked by helicopter to Grey's home, an elegant apartment which is more hotel looking than home. After drinks and explanations, he gets her to sign a nondisclosure agreement then comes the big reveal. <br/><br/>Ana is taken up to Grey's 'Playroom'. Naively, she believes this to mean a place where he stores his Xbox but it certainly isn't. What it is, is the elegant, opulently coloured and designed for purpose room for sexual bondage, domination and Sada-masochist activities. After showing her floggers, paddles, whips, canes, a frame system for restraint, a bench for spanking, a bed complete with more rings and restraints and a couch, he explains that this is what he enjoys and that he doesn't do conventional relationship type stuff.<br/><br/>All of this seems extremely overwhelming and Ana is understandably shocked. She reveals to Grey that she has no experience of sexual matters as she is a virgin and he looks at her with new eyes. With no further ado on his part, he seeks to 'rectify' the situation and has sex with her. <br/><br/>From this moment on, the film becomes very much about how their relationship is a to and fro. Grey tells Ana why he is the way he is in a forest walk and explains the influence of Elena, his 'Mrs Robinson' and why he was her submissive for some years. There are long moments where Ana researches the role he wants her to play, that of a sexual submissive and, with the help of a laptop given to her by Grey, begins to realise that she isn't sure this is what she wants. There is no doubt that she is enjoying sex with Grey but there is also that other side and its a difficult one. Eventually, Ana jumps in the deep end and decides to go into the playroom and gets involved. Prior to this point, the sex has been interesting and rather romantic, but then things get darker. Grey is in his element here and knows what he's doing. <br/><br/>Yet all things have to come to an end and the end is heart rendering. Ana asks how 'bad' the punishment can be and Grey responds by beating her 6 times with a braided leather belt. Ana's horror at what he's done echoes and their story ends as it started: her in an elevator. <br/><br/>Firstly, this film isn't the book. Yes, it shares the same characters as the book but that is where the similarity ends. This is a stylishly lit, well edited, beautifully rendered film.Even Grey's playroom is a work of art, both beautiful and intimidating. This is how you imagine a billionaire would conduct his BDSM lifestyle. <br/><br/>The problem with this film is not the way it looks or the characters. Jamie Dornan is okay as Christian Grey but always looks as if he is fighting with the script and wants to say more meaningful things. Dakota Johnson's character of Ana is far better depicted in the movie than on the page. She is self-possessed, sure of what she wants and less naive than her book character, who looks very different in comparison. The Ana of the film is, for some parts, calling the shots. The Ana of the book is too nervous to know what she really wants. Again, the script does neither of these characters any favours. There are too many unintentionally funny moments there. <br/><br/>Neither is the film depicting, as some have argued, domestic abuse. Christian Grey, at some points in the film, tells Ana that he is not right for her. Prior to showing her the playroom, he tells her that his helicopter is ready for him to take her home if she really wants to go. Ana is not forced or tied up against her will."

I read all 3 books in a week, I am 25 and this was my first experience with literary porn lol being a fan of Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte I can safely say that the 50 shades trilogy was terrible but I read on because every reader wants to know the end of a story and what a predictable ending it was. however, this review is about this particular movie and yes it was a crappy movie but having read the book it was exactly as expected just with less sex and no penis. the actors actually played their roles quite well, these were not difficult roles to portray anyway. Tortured male billionaire that exercises control in every way meets clumsy girl next door highly opinionated girl and they unknowingly fall in love, the only angle being the whole BDSM thing. Both the story and the characters were clearly not difficult for the author to create so they shouldn't have been difficult to portray. The soundtrack is excellent and the directing not too bad. whoever said there was no sex appeal lol really? Dakota Jonson was clearly sexually turned on by Jaime dornan and he seemed less and less in control of himself as he gets to know her which is what happens in the book. its not a cinematic masterpiece, it never was and it never will be.<br/><br/>This movie is all that it should have been, the only more that should be expected is more sex and more penis."

But anyways I suggest others to watch this movie if your interested in different things like myself.I hope they continue to make more to fit with the rest of the series. I also liked the cast that was picked at first I thought that they didn't fit the roles of the movie, but after watching I think they did really well."

","I really DO NOT get all the hate reviews. First of all, if you didn't like the books, why would you see the movie? Second, to everyone who says it's ""just porn"" and you had to leave...are you completely oblivious to what this movie was about? How could you NOT KNOW that it would be extremely sexual? Were you living under a rock when the books went viral? <br/><br/>It's a good movie, very honoring to the book. Dakota was a PERFECT Ana!<br/><br/>I am eagerly awaiting the second movie. <br/><br/>I also think a lot of people forget all the horrendously negative reviews (and many rightfully so) about the first Twilight movie and look at how huge that franchise became and still is? <br/><br/>To everyone who says this was a flop, just go look at the box office sales. It's obviously not a flop. I hope the author backs off so they can get the second movie out ASAP."

","This movie is about love, granted it has allot of sex, but every fresh and new relationship has allot of sex. The idea that there is ""abuse"" or ""rape"" is ridiculous. No one is forced to do anything they don't want to do. I say that most of the bad reviews are from men who feel lacking in some department. The bottom line in this movie is a tale about love, maybe he is a little dark and mysterious but he is also a lost soul looking for salvation. He is obviously tormented by his own desires and does not want to hurt her. She comes into it with her eyes open and she willingly submits to him. No ""rape"" no ""abuse"". All the ""men"" who want to talk down about this movie need to re-examine there own relationships and rethink how they treat their wives or girlfriends. Women like for their men to act like men not sniveling imbeciles."

","In my opinion the film was very good. I think that lots of negative opinion are inadequate. Because the film is grand, it is a flimsy-rough romantic movie, of course we should not expect the same as the book, because the book is ever so much more detailed...a book with this object book,detailed. I went to cinema, but so that I can it will not be just the same/self-same as book. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan played very well their roles (Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey). I think that this is not uncomplicated role. I congrats to them! I like this movie, and already I saw twice (: I love it! (a lot of people to set film against book, which bluntness...)"
"kenny-kuni","8","2","8","21 February 2015"," It's not a porn but more romantic
","Tho many people say this movie is about sadism and masochism~ in my point of view, the director seems to lead the audiences to believe there is some kind of chemistry between them, maybe it's so called ""the romance between dominate and submissive"", if you ask what think about the movie itself, I'll say, way better than the book, not just because soundtrack is beautiful and the main actor and the actress are good looking screen couples~ but also, the director cut off many pointless chapters, especially related to ""the contract or inner-murmur of the actress"". However, this movie seems not finished, tho I only went through half of the book instead of covering the whole story, I still can sense that there're something more not being filmed. To be honest, the novel is really boring and took me almost half year to decide to quit. I think I might reconsider to complete this challenge someday~ to dig out more about Grey~ so curiosity to know what happened to him exactly, and what those fifty shades are?"

","I read all 3 books 2x. I liked the books. But the movie was made with the assumption that everyone read the books. So it made no sense for those people. I on the other hand who read the books, found the acting, the casting and chemistry between all the actors to suck! Jamie Dornan was not a convincing Christian Grey at all!! Neither was Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele. She was just horrible for the part, not appealing to the eye at all (yes i know in the books she is an average looking girl but come on this is a movie) she needed to be a versatile girl who could look both average and beautiful when dressed and glamed up. I don't think I will watch the 2nd in theaters, probably wait to stream it, so I don't waste any money on it. Unless they decide to change the actors, the directors or something, because it cannot go on like this. What Were They Thinking!. The directing was horrible. Disappointed because I was a fan of the books. Please save your money and Do Not Pay To Watch this movie!"

","While the acting and portrayal of the tormented Christian Grey was fantastic and he should go on to do amazing things. The plot and controversy has been massively over exaggerated with nothing much happening and a whole lot of over exuberant rope tying the movie could be summarised in a Youtube clip. The lead actress had an amazing bum but I can't say anything much nicer about the movie. I would not recommend seeing the movie, but Jamie Dornan could become one of the great actors, with a voice suitable for Batman and all the intensity of a fantastic actor. Even the sex scenes were tamed and the extreme, bondage was surprisingly tame with a bit of blindfolding and some gentle stroking to tease. About 20 seconds of anything controversial make this the most over hyped movie, without any reasoning."
"aharmas","6","2","8","14 February 2015"," Romantic Hoopla
","Based on one of the best selling titles of the century, ""Fifty"" introduces us to two unlikely candidates for a romantic match. He's has a disturbing set of ideas, originating in a mysterious liaison with a friend of the family. She has managed to remain pure in the modern world but surrenders to his magnetism when they meet. She's warned, but she still lets herself be trapped into his luxurious and dominant trap.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of controversy about what one was expecting to see in the film adaptation of the novels, when the package is delivered, the results are at best handsomely produced, well cast, but somehow has a truncated spirit, whatever that might be. That is the dilemma here: it tries to be both, and it's like having oil and water. Someone is going to get burned, and it might be the audience.<br/><br/>It's a handsome film, with depictions of a world we might never get to experience. There are sport cars, helicopter and gliders, expensive presents, clothes in a very exclusive and rarefied universe. He's all about money, power and control. On the other hand, she comes from more humble origins and has worked hard to achieve her present condition. She might be intelligent but has no idea on how to deal with relationships or judge characters.<br/><br/>Dakota is pretty, and her Anastasia is a lovely creation. She has expressive eyes and lips. Her nature is more emotional and vulnerable, with apparently average ambitions for her potential mate. Running into Mr. Grey proves troublesome because he's, well, more demanding, seductive, interesting, and maybe more of a pain in more than one way.<br/><br/>There is not much of a courtship. It is all presented in broad strokes. They meet, and the fire is ignited. He is aware that she might not be good for his designs; yet the implication is that he's now contending with new emotions and forces. For us to understand what impedes his embracing of this amazing love relationship, we might need to read the subsequent chapters or wait for the sequels.<br/><br/>So, we have flashes of what made the book a bestseller, without her commentary and reflection. Here is for us to see how a screenwriter had adapted a very straightforward but problematic relationship. Yes, there are hints and demonstrations of this being a Cinderella story, of this going into the pantheon of great love stories, but it's burdened by its origins. Is he a psycho? Is she just plain dumb. You would think that with all that money, therapy would have been more effective.<br/><br/>Then, there is the abrupt ending. They want to clear the air, fight, and soon we have an awakening, a door opens and shuts on us, leaving a very frustrated audience. We know it's not over, but I wonder how many people are going to be unsatisfied because these characters are after all, shells of some individuals who could be fascinating to know and find out more details about. We have seen a ""love"" story between two very pretty people but who have no idea where this might be going because they're forcing themselves to keep their eyes shut, their minds confused, and their intelligence bound."
"itsachfigueroa68","9","2","8","14 February 2015"," it is what it is
","i am not a fan like so many this series had, but i have to said that i had read this book almost 3 years ago and i did find that the book was not very well written and i was not very happy when i find out that the writer was inspired by twilight movies but anyway back to the main point the movie .<br/><br/>At first the two main characters were not may favorite but i was well lets give them a try, as the clips were coming out to the public i starting to get the same feeling that i was getting when they first announce twilight and i was holy hell this is going to be another twilight movie for teenager . As i was reading the comments for other people that they watch the movie almost a weeks in advance i was like i knew that this movie was going to be just like twilight a very big disappointment.<br/><br/>Surprise surprise i when to see the movie on the 12 of this month and i found the movie very fast pase the first couple 30 minutes i even knew which chapter were on as the movie move on , what i found very peculiar is that the movie give me something that the book could not show emotions but not from Ana side . Mr Grey as we all known is very cold and intimidating during most book he wants things on his way and he always get what he wants , surprise me is the fact that i could see Mr.Grey frustrating and that is very human of him for those that they have see the movie would know that Mr.Grey facial expression were very conceal but they show just what you need to be suspect of his next step towards Ana.<br/><br/>I not going to lie in this part if there is Sex as the book the answer is not , the sex scene were very well work and they don't look over act at all what i really was just tired was of seeing (Dakota)Ana all the time naked . We only have just a very few limited chance to see (Jamie ) and is not frontal i understand that he did sing a contract that he would not like to be shot in his frontal why they didn't did the same with her at least both audience would have the same quantity of nudes for both part.<br/><br/>if we talk about the scrip there is something that we all have to understand if the writer is involved in the filming of the movie believe me the movie is not going to be great as for example ( Twilight, harry potter , the mortal instrument,hunger games part one ) and so many others that they director has conflict with the writer so i have to said that the Director for this movie elevated the couple things for each character and they were good if i mention that they make Ana just what i expect for a hero in this movie she has her own personality and have a choice in this movie unfortunate in the book she is more like Bella Swan (twilight) , Ana on the other hand is more careful she knows that is getting to a area that she is not aware of the consequence but still , We see a funny side from her i think the best scene is the one that she is drunk and she decide to call Christian and ask him why did he bought the books for her and believe me i found that scene very funny and completed i was not expecting that in that part, the other one is the Business meeting that she has with Mr.Grey and that was very good .<br/><br/>If i continued i would not stop mention the funny and sad moments of the movie i am not going to lie saying that more than ones i just want to stand up and just leave the theater . i think that what make me stay was the end of the movie and i have to said that it was not a disappointment. the last 20 minutes of the movie are the best of the best of the entire movie . Seeing Ana put a stop to Christian i think was the best just as i imagine in my head when i was reading this book 3 years ago but not forgetting Mr.Grey in the last 5 minutes of the movie where his his facial expression his body language his enjoyment doing what he was doing were lethal for me OMG i did see Mr. Christian Grey and they do have Chemistry but don't forget to see his face after Ana said her goodbyes is a moment to remember forever and that make me want too see part 2.<br/><br/>overall is a movie that is not bad but is not excellent neither , if you are a fan go with open mind and you may want to see the movie again to clarify couple doubts. when i discuses the movie with my friend we all ended up in the same conclusion that the movie was not terrible as the comment make them see but is the type of one that make you want to see again for details that you may have miss in the first time watching this movie ."

","Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson were amazing, especially with what they had to work with. Please I hope they get a different screen writer and director if there is another instalment. The screen writer definitely missed the mark. Spent way to much time on Ana's character with little writing effort for Christian's character. Script was way to choppy, seriously are there not any good screen writers out there. Maybe you should hire the screen writer that did ""The Fall"", now that's someone who knows what they are doing. The actors defiantly had chemistry, at the beginning anyway. They seemed to loose it in the end. It was fun, sexy and witty and then it was just nothing. Christian was suppose to be strong and mysterious, the writer didn't capture that at all. She made him more awkward than anything. Christian was sassy and fun in the book."

I can understand people who have not read the books downing this movie but if you haven't read them then you don't know the whole point of this first movie. It is a love story of a shy girl who meets and emotionally screwed up man. Another thing you would understand if you had read the books is that in the first book and with this first movie they are supposed to be awkward with each other because it is a new situation for the both of them. I think that they portrayed the characters personalities rather well. When the next movie is made of the second book there will be a lot more people that will like it than don't like it because you will begin to understand the series more. Don't judge a book or movie by its cover because you may miss something very good. I suggest that whomever has not read the books do so and then watch the movie and see what you missed by not reading between the lines."

","Most people know what to expect when you got tickets to see this movie. This was not going to be a masterpiece and most likely would be incredibly raunchy and stupid. A lot of people are giving this movie a bad review but it delivered on what it was suppose to be .Granted I know the sex scenes were not as prevalent as they were in the book but I can't say I was expected by this. This is a Hollywood movie and you can only ramp up the sex so much so that it isn't rated NC-17. This movie is about a man named Christian Grey who likes to be in control of his relationships and has his woman sign a contract so that they know what they are getting themselves into. It seems like he wants just a physical relationship but when he meets Ana Steele all of that seems to change. He constantly brings up this supposed contract and his red room of pain to use on her but appears to want a normal relationship with her. He also appears confused of what he wants even though he does all of the things I guy would do for his girlfriend. The interesting thing I found was that Ana also wanted a relationship with him but when it came to sex she allowed him to do what he wanted and basically becoming his submissive. She constantly brought this up but almost was too intimated to take it to action. I""m glad she left him in the end when she found that she was not into his way of doing things. People must realize that this movie was going to be trashy and incredibly cheesy. Im sure the producers wanted bigger actors in these roles but it most likely would have ruined their careers. The actors who poetry Grey and Ana will probably never have as big a hit as this movie. Whether it helps them in their careers is another story. If big actors were in this movie I would have put Taylor Swift in the role as Ana and maybe the guy who played Thor in the role"

","I have read this series so many times I have lost count.<br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey (the movie) was very good, especially when one compares it to many movies made from books. I was not thrilled with the choice of Jamie and Dakota but, they pulled it off! <br/><br/>This review touches on where Fifty missed the mark, and that falls on the Production Company and EL James' shoulders. The supporting cast. If you are not a fan of the series and went into the theater to watch this just because, you would leave displeased. The supporting cast was nothing but poor acting, poor choice for characters. I kept thinking...did any of the decision makers read the book! Not one character hit the mark and the acting was not only bad but weird.<br/><br/>To the Production Company, Director, Casting Supervisor and EL James, ther are two more movies to shoot. Easily 3 hour movies-cut back on the rush feeling; steamer sex scene's (sex is steamier on network TV-Sons of Anarchy); revamp your supporting cast."

SAD!

It is the awakening of a educated & intelligent young woman & a true love story. God made our bodies receptors of both pain & pleasure of which there is a very fine line between.<br/><br/>In my opinion this movie is defined by 2 lines.

"filipemanuelneto","3","1","3","20 February 2020"," Spank me like you do.
","This film was undoubtedly one of the biggest box office hits of the decade, but it was largely due to the already dizzying success of the original material, the erotic novels by E. L. James. I have no doubt that the audience that went to see this film did it out of curiosity or because they had previously read the books and liked it. So, the film already had a well defined target audience. But as I have not read the books (nor do I intend to) I will speak only of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the plot very weak. Anastasia Steele is a shy, sexually inexperienced young woman who immediately feels a strong attraction to Christian Gray, a young millionaire with an almost latent aggressiveness. From there, the two have a relationship full of fetishes of authority and pain, where the romance insists on arising and leaving both confused and bewildered, especially Gray, who seems to carry a lot of childhood traumas and like to discount all that on the body. of their young sex slaves. This is the plot of the film, and I am aware that the book is the same, but the truth is that it makes no sense, if we take into account the normal and expected reactions between a man and a woman ...<br/><br/>Observe carefully: first, it is almost impossible to find, today, a young adult totally inexperienced in bed and in sex. It can happen, of course, but it is rare. The first meeting between them is also something that could only happen in a book: Anast√É¬°sia, who should interview Gray, is so tense and shy that she doesn't even know what she is doing! And he, a very busy man, gives ten minutes to a young woman who has not rigorously prepared herself for the interview she wanted to do! He is an intense, even brutal man, who could have any woman, but he is enchanted by the tastiest girl on the planet. Even so, he does not intend a normal courtship, but a sexual and possession relationship, bureaucratic, well defined on paper, forgetting that quickly when the desire and passion became uncontrollable. And everything happens in a fraction of ... days? One day she is in his office, not knowing what to ask him and, a short time later, she is relaxed talking to his mother as if she were already part of the family. None of this makes sense, but this is just a bit of the absurdities of the whole story, common to the film and books.<br/><br/>Dakota Johnson is perfect for her character, as she is a totally uninteresting woman, who could go unnoticed by the eyes of the most ardent of males. For his part, Jamie Dornan is too kind and friendly to be Christian Gray. His character should harmoniously combine the beauty and virility of a young adult with a more mature and somber personality than normal at his age and some brutality and strength of character. I even dare to think that the ideal actor for Gray should be (or appear to be) slightly older than Dornan. The rest of the cast is OK but has no room to do anything really good. The dialogues are hideous, and if they originated from the book then I did well not to read it.<br/><br/>It goes without saying, I believe, that this film is totally inappropriate for children and teenagers, given the heavy erotic material and the language used. The film's nudity is something that the fans considered residual, but I would consider it too much if it did not take into account the original material in which the film. The film has good production values, starting with good photography, good scene props (it would highlight the famous red room and all its paraphernalia), satisfactory editing work and, above all, a good soundtrack, which is in the heard and has good songs (I would highlight ""Earned it"" and ""Love me Like You Do"").<br/><br/>In short: when starting with bad source material, the film was doomed from the start. The only thing that made E. L. James's book good for the cinema was the number of copies sold and the absolute guarantee that the film would sell equally."

And the second was pretty 'Dakota Johnson'. <br/><br/>By the way the movie was really intense to me for the eagerness of what will be next, like will he make her as his girlfriend and become a nice person like she ever wanted? going to be a forever happy one? etc. I almost felt like she conquered 80% of him and kept it going to 100%. But tragically the last 15 mins changed everything and spoiled the soothing pace of the movie. She gave up on him, and gone from his apartment because of things that never meant to be happened. <br/><br/>Even though something horribly happened, I had a faith like any other viewer that he sooner or later showed up in front of her and beg for her love and apologize for his peculiar conduct. But the odds are favored at the end, like nothing happened and they were separated for a life time I guess! The author may be an intelligent person but I wonder, what kind of intellect was that at the end that he made. Couldn't the authors be a normal person and think like a normal person?"

","When it comes to the best selling book, 50 Shades of Gray, I was never familiar with it nor did I ever read it, I only became aware of the movie after I saw a trailer of it and I had no interest in seeing it due to it's content. So late last year, I plucked up courage and sat down to watch 50 Shades of Gray and I absolutely despised it. From it's piss-poor writing and uncomfortable sex scenes to it's god-awful acting, this is easily the worst movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The story begins with a collage girl named Anastasia Steele who goes to interview billionaire Christian Gray when her roommate is unable to go. Upon arriving at his office, Anastasia fumbles her way though the interview but Gray takes a shine to her. After she leaves, he stakes her at her job and soon begins to shower her with gifts and she attends a photo-shoot with him. Later on, Gray attempts to get Ana to sigh an agreement to stop her from telling anyone about their love affair and tells her that he only has relationships that involve bondage defined by a contract. What follows in Ana being Gray's sex slave while Christian's more interesting side comes into play.<br/><br/>This day in age, some people no longer understand what acceptable or excellent is but instead settling on uninspired and consider that great and the benchmark for what movies and filmmaking should be and it sadly seems that even something as wretched and foul as 50 Shades of Garbage can't even be considered dull but rather just laughably bad as there are people who have praised this movie for the actors and for being so romantic, something I clearly didn't see. While I have never read the book, it seems that a lot of people who have read it hated it as in order for the reader to like it, they needed to use their intelligence. The successfulness of the book is established in its fictional viewpoints and while imagination can provide a person with certain feelings than most other things, the movie certainly doesn't live up to what it promises even for the most idiotic minds, let alone somebody with a wildly gifted mind. The only desire the movie will grant you is how quick you can rush out of the theater or how fast you can turn off your TV.<br/><br/>As somebody who against sexual abuse including BDSM, every time Christian and Ana are on screen making love, it made me groan in pain and was gut-wrenching to watch. The failure of the screenwriter to develop the sexual relationship between these two is nothing short of appalling and while Christian may appear to be every woman's dream man but instead molests a young woman simply because he had issues with his own mother and is committed to using abuse to get what he wants rather than actually having a relationship with Ana who seems to have no sexual fondness until she meets Christian and yet willfully goes along with anything he asks her to do even if it means her getting abused just shows me how sick and perverted this movie truly is.<br/><br/>If you read an actual romance book like Outlander, the lead is somber and disturbed for reasons that have significance and ability and is someone who commands admiration, not expect it just because they're a rich playboy and who has already shown themselves in ways that consist of pain, blood and jeopardy, not by pushing women to have sex with him though bullying tactics. How E.L. James was able to take a moronic Twilight fan fiction and turn that into a best selling series then into a movie franchise is beyond me. A 26 year old tycoon and a shy collage girl who feels the need to say oh my every few minutes, seriously?! Is this what writing from a woman's perspective has become?! Great job on that one, Kelly Marcel. Of course, there have been people who have watched the movie or read the book who have disregarded that throughout the movie, there is molestation, non consensual lovemaking and lots of physical, spoken and emotional abuse where Christian beats, spanks, hits and bullies Ana and he even controls every aspect of her life from the food she eats to how long she sleeps and yet shows not even a crumb of love for her. What kind of person would do something like that?! In fact, I would so far to call Christian and Ana just might be the worst on-screen couple since Edward and Bella.<br/><br/>As for the script, it's a complete joke, something that would have been laughed off the Lifetime Channel. The dialog is easily the worst I've ever heard spoken in a feature film. In fact, the movie seems to be adrift in whatever time period it is as there are times throughout the movie where certain words are used in a certain way that is intended to come across as edgy and outrageous but it instead comes across as pathetic while the character growth is non-existent which is made even more laughable because the two leads have zero on-screen chemistry which left me not caring about either one of them nor are they interesting in any capacity. Yeah, Gray's taste in women may be seen as appealing to some but it comes across as repulsive. For the viewer to become attached to a lead in a movie, it has to be because he or she is charismatic or has a backstory that is interesting or makes us feel for them, things Bela Lugosi in Dracula has because people find him compelling and not because of him being a vampire but because he's a man with a past along with actual individuality and charm while Christian Gray is a bland and blank slate devoid of any personality or charisma.<br/><br/>The performances are just as bad, but not even Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett could have worked with such horrible dialog, and while Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dorian are god-awful in their roles, a lot of that can be attested to director Sam Taylor-Johnson's lifeless directing and the fact that the two leads didn't like working with each other. Dakota is far from convincing as Anastasia and comes across as a vapid and weak woman who needs a man to be with her at all times and Johnson fails at playing the part while Dorian comes across as an overbearing, creepy and unlikable moron who can't seem to be able to smile throughout the entirety of the film but instead uses the same idiotic, overly-somber facial movements for the duration of the movie. All the supporting characters are equally pointless and uninteresting.<br/><br/>The one great thing about this mess of celluloid is the photography and aerial shots; they look spectacular particularly the in-fight shots of Seattle or when Ana and Christian are flying, but apart from that, 50 Shades of Gray is not worth watching, I beg you, please do not go see this movie. Your brain and soul will thank you for it. In fact, watching paint dry would be more entertaining then watching this movie."

","I cannot believe I actually watched this. Me, who solemnly swore he wouldn't watch such rubbish, made the bold choice to watch this for the sake of his friend. That's how kind I am. I would succumb to this for friendship. Honestly though, this has less substance than a used condom. I'm not even going to summarise the ""plot"", because there was hardly any. Young girl falls in love with rich man who creates a contract for some submissive dominance relationship thing. I don't know, and I don't care. The film is shot well atleast, and has aesthetic appeal. Don't forget the hardcore foreplay and rough sex...oh wait, it's tame? Oh dear. I've seen more convincing sex (and better plot) in a 70's soft porno. The screenplay can be best described as monotonous. Example: ""I don't make love. I f*ck...hard"". Or even: ""Because I'm fifty shades of f*cked up, Anastasia"". What even was this!? Have we, the human race, actually come to this!? I can't comprehend the stupidity of this dialogue and how undramatic it was. The most excitement I had was attempting to work out the word for a 'vagina wig' which I'm sure Dakota Johnson was wearing. ""Hmmm I know it sounds like mankini? No wait, I'll FaceTime my mum, she'll know...MERKIN! It's a merkin!"". The sex, which the plot clearly revolves around, is too funny to watch. Whips, chains, rope...we got it all, and it's hilarious. Then the accompaniment of generic pop songs, oh yes it gets better. Bursting into Ellie Goulding's ""Love Me Like You Do"" has never felt so good. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan were abysmal, not their fault though to be fair. Goes to show that a screenplay is the most central and important aspect to a captivating film. And captivating this is not. However, my life is now complete. This film brought me joy. It is so atrocious that I actually loved it. Get ready for when I watch the sequel, I can't wait..."

But I can't get my head around the idea that a beautiful, sexy, smart, interesting woman like Anastasia (as portrayed by Dakota Johnson) would have any interest at all in a mindless, boring, selfish, cardboard cutout of a man like Christian. He has money. Great. That's always a plus. But is having money really enough to make up for his utter lack of any discernable personality?

"Dan1863Sickles","2","1","3","22 January 2018"," I Put A Spell On You
","People talk like this is the worst movie ever made, like it's some Ed Wood Plan 9 fiasco. Well, it's a very bad movie all right. But it's not that bad. <br/><br/>Can you really hate a movie that starts with a sexy cover version of Screaming Jay Hawkins' ""I Put A Spell On You"" over the opening titles? I mean, Creedence Clearwater Revival covered that song. It's Fifties rock, and it's the real deal! <br/><br/>(Idea for a movie: John Fogerty plays a beloved sixty-something rock legend who has a secret side as a pain-inflicting Dom! They call him the Midnight Choogler . . .)<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is horrible, but not because there's too much brutal violence or hardcore sex. It's just that Master Grey, the handsome boy billionaire who like to tie women up and punish them, lacks all human personality and is a totally lifeless character. Fifty Shades is not a real romance, because there is no romantic hero. There's just an empty suit.<br/><br/>See, when you read a real romance, like OUTLANDER by Diana Gabaldon, the hero is dark and tortured for reasons that have weight and stature. He's a guy who commands respect from everyone, not just one impressionable young girl. He's a guy who has already proved himself in ways that involve real blood, sweat, and danger. If someone's going to spank a young girl, it ought to be someone who knows something about pain. A brawler with a broadsword, a warrior from a proud people, not some faceless billionaire who pushes buttons. <br/><br/>Fifty Shades fails because this Grey guy is just not an interesting person. His sexual tastes may be interesting, or shocking, but other than that, so what? Think about Bela Lugosi in the original Dracula. Women find him fascinating for reasons that have nothing to do with his vampire nature. Like when they ask him about fixing up his new home, Carfax Abbey, and he says, ""I shall do very little repairing. It reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle, in Transylvania."" Dracula is a man with a past, a real identity, real allure. Christian Grey is banal, empty, as lifeless as the models last year's fashion magazines. <br/><br/>I keep wanting to say that Dakota Johnson was great as Anastasia. She was, but only because the script actually gives her something to work against. Oh, and I love the fact that her blonde roommate turns out to be nice and not killed at the end."

"vesil_vesalier","8","1","3","29 September 2016"," You think you know what you're getting into, and I think that's the problem
","Expectations destroy movies. It happened with THE MATRIX sequels. It happened with TRON: LEGACY.<br/><br/>And it happened with this movie. Let me explain.<br/><br/>Every criticism I've heard for this movie either speaks to its nature of irritating the feminist movement, a true lack of understanding of BDSM culture, or not enough shown in the sex scenes to truly satisfy the viewing audience.<br/><br/>ALL of those things are based on expectations, not true evaluations of the film you're seeing.<br/><br/>If you are someone that is in touch with what BDSM is, you will be looking for it here, a kind of statement to the kind of lifestyle and the practices with which you are accustomed and proud to finally see detailed on the screen in front of you, and you will be disappointed to find it lacking. If you consider yourself a feminist, you will probably be irritated with Anastasia's behavior, expecting her to at some point get even with Christian for his overall treatment of her, which of course never really happens. And if you are looking for pornography, I have to admit I've seen racier scenes in other movies than this one.<br/><br/>So what is this movie? And who is it for? The answer came to me one day when I was asked what it was about. Although I can easily remember the plot and the story, describing its genre was challenging. Is it a romance? Not really. Is it pornography? No. Is it a comedy? No way. Well then, what the hell is it? <br/><br/>And that's when it struck me. It was right at that moment that it hit me as to why I liked this movie when nobody else did. Why it intrigued me in a way that seemed to elude everyone else.<br/><br/>No, I'm not referring to a lack of expectations.<br/><br/>It's gray. The movie IS gray.<br/><br/>I've never been fond of classification, not for the sake of argument and certainly not when it comes to people. Labels should be left strictly for filing cabinets. Addressing thing with labels manipulates them, and reduces them a little with every label you add. I try to keep things simple. It was good. Or it was bad.<br/><br/>I liked this. It was unique.<br/><br/>Since FIFTY SHADES OF GREY never really defines itself at all, you do have to wonder where all the expectations are coming from. It never claimed to be a movie about BDSM culture. Not every woman in movies has to be the perfect representation of the purest feminist ideals. And porn is already readily available on the internet at virtually no cost. Trying to define it is challenging because I don't think it really has anything to define itself in the first place. It's a little bit of everything. It teases at ideas, flirts with possibilities. Like the relationship between Christian and Anastasia itself, it flutters back and forth between where you expect it to go and where you've never been before.<br/><br/>It literally is fifty shades of gray.<br/><br/>I can understand why for most people this might not be a good thing. A lot of people need to have things spelled out, defined so that they know where to put it in their minds. But if you can let all of that go, and try to go into it without truly expecting anything, you may be surprised at what you find.<br/><br/>To solidify my opinion, I will leave you with what intrigued me the most in this film, and what will have me going back for its sequels. It might seem trivial at first, but perhaps if you really sit back and think about it, it might intrigue you, as well. No, it wasn't the sex.<br/><br/>The butler/driver, Jason Taylor, played by Max Martini. He reinforces something that can easily be overlooked, if you don't really notice it. Once I did, it made me wonder about the mysterious Christian Grey. I hope that I'm not seeing something that isn't really there, not setting myself up for disappointment later, but¬Ö <br/><br/>It was the scene in which he is bringing Anastasia to Christian, near the end of the movie. She asks, ""How is he today?"" And Taylor responds, ""He is a bit preoccupied, I'm afraid."" The man looked genuinely concerned.<br/><br/>Think about that. This man, this servant of the seemingly dominating Christian Grey actually WORRIES about his boss. It made me think about the people that worked for him, the woman who served dinner to Christian and Anastasia while they were busy discussing the contract. These people seemed to genuinely care about Christian, all the while knowing what he was doing. How is this possible? <br/><br/>Unless there is more to Christian than meets the eye.<br/><br/>It was enough to interest me in the future of these movies, and I hope it isn't just something I saw that wasn't really there. To add, it was not the only thing I liked about the movie. I loved the shots, the various scenes that set the stage for the story. Visually speaking it was very beautiful. The soundtrack is amazing, as well. The actors sold me, delivering solid performances. I find Dakota Johnson charming, and Jamie Dornan keeps Christian an intriguing mystery.<br/><br/>The dialogue, in spots, is a bit off. I've been told it was taken directly from the book, and that was actually where most people had the highest criticisms with the writing.<br/><br/>For my money, it's a unique story that I hope only gets more interesting. And yes, I am aware that I am in the minority this time.<br/><br/>But I just don't care. I enjoyed this film. If you can go in with an open mind, maybe you can, too."

","I don't know what to make of this, exactly. It's clich√© and it's clearly someone's little fantasy. A girl meets a filthy rich guy and and boom. Gives it that sensual touch. And then the dirt gets sexy... well, it's supposed to, anyway. Depends on what's your cup of tea. Still... the whole thing is very Mary Sue.<br/><br/>The whole construct is a wee bit improbable. It's not a very well written story or well constructed as a film. It's also not making any favors to the BDSM community, because it's highly unlikely this is how a BDSM relationship will happen.<br/><br/>There's only ONE redeeming quality - and even that spells bad news for the film because it's not a universal one. You have to have a certain mindset to notice it. It may speak for a certain group of people in the BDSM community, but for the sake of the film itself it's too little too late.

Are they REALLY making a sequel, ""Fifty Shades Darker?"" Is this where she sues Grey for rape, torture & battery, making a mockery of real victims? I suppose it was & would be perfect in our upside down/inside out society, where most anyone can claim victim status. All of a sudden he went too far? it was nothing and she knew exactly what she was into at that point, insisted on it, then brought psychological devastation (for no reason) upon a man who had been nothing but good to her, and needed understanding & love, not abuse & abandonment. The end is so disappointing & disturbing, that I wish I could unsee it. One of the worst movies I've ever seen! I hope the book was better."

","POSSABLE SPOILER ALERT: It's not as bad as everyone says it is. Note: I call it how I saw it.And hare's how I saw it.<br/><br/>1: Although true the 'Dilog' is could be better, but let's face it, it could be worse too, in addition for certain people with this type of movies let's just say they in it for the 'Dilog' or the plot (I'll get to that in a moment) 2: On the up side at least the Soundtrack is good that is what every one agrees on but hare is not what every body agrees on though, that the Soundtrack maybe good but, there is not enough of it, I felt there are some scenes that need music. And other scenes doesn't necessary need that Soundtrack but it was nice to have anyways.<br/><br/>3: The reason I think that a lot of people hate this movie so much is because this movies is for those of us that haven't got the chance to read the novel, and for those that have got the chance to read the novel have set there expectations so high believing that it would just like the book scene for scene and word for word. I think that is why I gave it a 6 but have I had read the novel i Probably would have given it a 1 just like everyone else that have. That is like going in to a Superhero film expecting to be just like it was in the comic every scene matching the comic pages exactually.<br/><br/>4: SPOILER: I like how in the beginning Mr. Gray's Office is metaphorically Dominating to make you the viewer feel not only that Gray is a dominate person but also you the viewer, feel as though you are in the movie being his already Submissive.<br/><br/>5: The Arc(s) are a little confusing I have to admit. as to the terms of development or evolution of our two main leads. It is like both of the two main leads can not decide what to do, it is like 'yes,no,yes,I don't know, Maybe' So in short for this part the Arc is weak.<br/><br/>6: Sometimes the 'Anticapation' is not really worth the wait when it come down to it.<br/><br/>7: The Gloomy and Quit tone seems to fit the movie,but I guess that is why every body prefers 'Secatary' over this, and why they hate this movie so much.<br/><br/>8: I like the pacing in this movie it is perfect it's not too slow like 'Oh coming is this 38hr movie done?' nor it is to fast where it's like 'What huh? what just happen I messed it?' The Pacing is perfect.<br/><br/>9: SPOILER: I exspectually like that this movie plays on Playfull or Soft Bondage or BDSM as I like to like it,it's a little more realistic that way in the real world. Had they gone the other way i would have just turned it off seeing it's not real to real life and it's was a wast of time. And space on my PVR 10: I have to admit during the movie I'm not sure if I should rout for the Ms. Steel (the female lead) she just like the Gray Character wasn't all that like able nor is she the type of Character that you can connect with or even want to connect with. On an emotional level I mean. And on that note. There is something artificial or fake about the Gray Character. I think that's another reason why every one prefers ""Secaratray"" over this movie.<br/><br/>11: SPOILER: The Cliffhanger was Disappointing to say the least there is simply no closure (if you could call it that)other than 'Goodbye Mr. Gray and oh and by the way I'm leaving whatever our arrangement was we have, it's been fun.'(Then elevator door closes) 'END MOVIE' <br/><br/>12: It is how ever different from other movies with this type of subject matter in it,I think that is another reason why every one simply hates this movie, they're simply not accustomed to this type of subject matter in a movie. Other than of course a certain type of entertainment.<br/><br/>13: Sure this movie is not perfect, but it is at least still a watchable movie, and even I wouldn't say 'A Must Own' but how this movie is still for those that are looking for some thing different to add to their movie collection.<br/><br/>CP: So in conclusion this movie was better than I expected, and remember I'm the type of person that sets his Bar impossible high I mean beyond Heaven High. After all it's not a action Movie with lots of gun fights and car chases. Those that go in expecting that would be very disappointed."

I don't expect a movie adaptation to be totally loyal to every detail the book mentions(especially in that case, because it's an extremely detailed book), but some of them are just important.<br/><br/>Since, I don't mean to sound all grumpy and be unfair, I want to mention the things I liked first. Jamie and Dakota ARE Christian and Anastasia, which was pure pleasure. The chemistry between them was more than satisfying and brought the book passion on screen. Also, I loved the music. Except for Love me like you do, which is not my cup of tea, I found that Crazy in love and Earned it were the most suitable thing for this project. Also, the Escala and Ana's apartment were really close to what I imagined during reading the books.<br/><br/>And now all these elements, which could make this movie 2 hours of guilty, amazing pleasure, were sent to hell by a really, and I mean really bad script. Important things, such as the eye rolling and much more, were cut off. Biting her lip was just TOO obvious and pretentious more like I want to look sexy than I feel awkward and unconsciously bite it. Also, you couldn't 100% get the movie, unless you had read the books. They skipped some serious events and the result was my non fan friend poking my shoulder every now and then and asking me what is missing.<br/><br/>It was good seeing these book come to life with such interesting cast, which sadly had the chance to be a 9 but instead became a 3. If you've read the books watch it just for the actors and some scenes, but if you haven't then there's just so many good movies out there. Don't spend 2 hours on this one."
"doomeddemon","1","1","3","13 March 2016"," Bad...
","First off, I read the books. And enjoyed them. This will probably be why I hated the movie so much. My first criticism would be that Grey is casted very poorly. The guy just doesn't suit the role. But my main disappointment was the screenplay. I really feel that a great romance movie could be made out of the trilogy. Unfortunately, someone smart thought that he could make a story better by rewriting all dialogues and even most scenes. The result is horrifying - you get the same events but with characters that feel completely different from the book, unbelievable, ridiculous even. A lot of people criticize the acting, and I'm not that good to judge, really, but I will make a point that this screenplay could not be acted good. No amount of acting would have made it believable. And why? Because someone read the book, COMPLETELY misunderstood the characters, and then had a VISION about how this story should be filmed as a story about a rich-ass moron pervert with no respect for women, and a horny college student with no self-awareness or self-esteem. And then they have sex, and that is the main and only drive of their relationship. Funny thing is - this movie would be much better if all scenes were simply filmed 100 percent by the book, with all dialogues unchanged. Even with bad acting. I get the impression that both scriptwriter and director read only the 1st part of the trilogy, hated it, deemed Grey a sicko and Ana as some stupid girl without any willpower, then sat together and thought: ""Damn, this kinds of characters are depicted so poorly in the book, and dialogues lack insane sex drive in every phrase, which should be a given in a PORN book. But we know how to fix this..."". Anyway, I'm rambling. For those who hated this movie - don't give up on the book. The book is about romance, not about perverts, contracts, sex and sadism, as the movie can make you think.a"

","Being a typical Fifty Shades of Grey fan I had previously already read the books and was a huge fan. I went to see the movie with my boyfriend on valentines day (He of course was so happy about this ha!) and despite the over critical reviews it was great!<br/><br/>The books are a lot better without a doubt, and I think the movie lacked the connection that the books gave Anna and Christian,the little things which made their relationship seem more romantic were missed out. Simple things like how he would track down her favourite brand of tea, or like how she bought him a model of the glider plane they flew together and he put it on his desk. Little parts like that in my opinion built the story up well in the books. Also... They made Christian kind of unlike-able right? That was something I didn't like so much, at least in the books you understood why he was the way he was better. The film only briefly touched on the fact that he had been abused as a child. <br/><br/>However, I still enjoyed the movie. I adore Jamie Dornan and I think they cast the characters really well. (although I didn't see the point in casting Rita Ora as Mia... She really didn't look the way I imagined Mia to look from her descriptions in the books) The banter between Christian and Anna was brilliant and even my boyfriend had a chuckle at some of the scenes. It really isn't as bad as people like to make out, I think it's just a lot of males hating on this movie as their girlfriends made them watch it... <br/><br/>Great Movie, Underrated if you ask me."

","One can say that it is a sort of Cinderella story, where a simple girl is suddenly overwhelmed by this stunning handsome gentle millionaire who takes an interest to her, she becomes fascinated, maybe even infatuated. However, it is no classic Cinderella, as she goes on to realize that he is in fact, no prince charming. Because of her immaturity and inexperience, at first she does not take his ""problems"" seriously to only when she's matured realize that.<br/><br/>I read just beyond half of the book and could not finish it. That kind of writing wasn't for me. But as a giant fan of cinema I must say this movie wasn't half so bad. The picture is amazing, the soundtrack is beautiful and the mystery portrayed by Christian Grey is very convincing. I felt that Dakota Johnson did a pretty decent job as Anastasia and was also very convincing in naivety and inexperience. I definitely look forward the sequel as I could not put myself through books 2 and 3. I do think they could have shown Christian as a more problematic overachiever, like in the book, and maybe show more of his past, but then again, the film is more concentrated in his obsession with ""getting the girl"", and getting her to agree to his crazy proposal. <br/><br/>But I definitely enjoyed he film!"
"cooperm-26264","1","1","3","23 December 2015"," An affront to cinema, literature, and anyone with half a brain cell
","""I don't make love. I f***. Hard"", says Christian Grey, in one of the most subtle, evocative scenes of the long-awaited feature presentation of E L James' bestseller, notorious for its graphic sex scenes and, above all, for being an absolute affront to literature at best. Naturally, one expects very little from a film based on degenerate trash, but director Sam Taylor-Johnson's interpretation manages to achieve the seemingly impossible, and deliver a film that quite frankly transcends the inarticulate and laughable prose of its source, resulting in one of the biggest insults to cinema in history. True, we expected it to be bad, but boy, is it bad¬Ö <br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey follows the story of literature student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and her encounter with the enigmatic billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), who is later revealed to be a sadist. Grey is presented as something of a tormented soul; a mystery. But really, the biggest mystery of all is how on earth a film with such hot sex appeal could be so bloody boring! <br/><br/>So, what are the film's flaws? How long have you got? For starters, the moral of the story is dubious at best. Initially, it appears to glorify sadism and even domestic violence, and yet by its conclusion it seems to indicate that violence for sexual gratification is wrong ‚Äì despite the fact that this forms the entire basis for the film's appeal, making its message somewhat hypocritical. But that's only really a problem if you analyse the film in any great detail; the truth is, this film isn't even worthy of this review. It's terrible; an unequivocal shambles. So why is it garnering so much attention? <br/><br/>One word: Sex. The media is obsessed with it, so much so that hordes of desperate, horny, middle-aged women flocked to the cinemas by the thousands to see it. This film's appeal is entirely sexual. The plot is bland, the acting is wooden, but the sex ‚Äì that's what people want to see. Sadly, nothing much happens, and the sex scenes (of which there is surprisingly very few) are about as tedious as the rest of the film, which plays out like an amateur porno. A bad amateur porno. Imagine two hours of a porn film without the porn, just the cheesy build-up. That's essentially what this film is. They say anticipation is half the thrill ‚Äì it's all the thrill in this film's case. <br/><br/>On a positive note, the cinematography is decent. But that's about it. All the same, nothing can save this film from the quagmire of tedium in which it is firmly sunk. The characters have no chemistry, and Dornan's thinly veiled Irish tongue leaks throughout. It's neither romantic nor sexy. Whoever commissioned this film should be bound and gagged. And not in a good way."
"morrighan1625","3","1","3","31 August 2015"," 50 Shades of Vanilla
","The Dilemma To see or not to see? That was the question in my mind when 50 Shades hit the cinema on Valentine's Day. In the end I could not resist it. The hype around the book was enough to entice me to read it, however four pages in I decided to stop because I love literature way too much to do that to myself. So, without further ado, my 50 Shades Experience.<br/><br/>The Opinion A lot has been written about it since its release; I did not know what to believe and what to dismiss as complete nonsense, to be honest 90% of the reviews are usually utter ""you know what"" anyway, but I must admit the theme appeals to me and having watched films like Secretary, I was not expecting a lot from 50 Shades. The main characters, Christian Grey, the billionaire sadist who was adopted and is scarred by some sort of a deep psychological trauma caused by a rough childhood, and the perfectly normal Anna Steele, an English literature graduate with a virginal fashion sense and playful eyes. Let's get one thing straight now, Anna is definitely not a Submissive, she loves his abs, his money and his assertiveness but she is a ""love hearts and flowers"" sort of girl. She hates pain, she hates following the rules of a BDSM relationship and ultimately, she just wants to have children with him, not to be punished for eating three peas when she was clearly instructed to eat two. In fact, the closest to leather she seemed to had ever come before meeting him was her handbag, and even then I have a feeling she wouldn't do leather. I think that is why everyone is crying ""domestic violence"" after watching 50 Shades. The fact that Christian is a Dominant male (Master), whereas Anna is not a Submissive (Slave) by nature. If you are expecting to watch a romantic film with a bit of soft core, then you will probably, just about, get your fix, but if you are expecting to watch a film that delves deep into BDSM and the psychopathology behind it, I would turn around and go shopping instead. Unlike in the film Secretary, where we were introduced to the emotional suffering which contributed to Maggie Gyllenhaal's character's self-harming and submissive tendencies, we are not sure what Anna's motivation to become a Submissive is, other than a desire to be controlled but only up to an ""acceptable"" level. Christian is a weak Dominant too, not only submitting to Anna's every whim, but openly admitting he used to be a Submissive! I mean WHAAAAAT. Way to inspire respect C! After I realized that there would be minimal BDSM going on in the film (disappointed face), I decided to take the film for what it was. A romantic story, with a lot of vanilla sex and a minimal amount of kinkiness. And you know what? I thoroughly enjoyed it. I even shed a tear at the end. As for Rita Ora's part¬Ö I think she must have appeared when I blinked."

","I am a male. If this were a porn movie, it would have aroused me. If it were a bad movie, I would have forgotten about it two hours later! I have not come across such a piece of art in a long time. And all I can say is that most critics are superficial movie-goers who only go to see movies to be entertained, stuff their faces with popcorn, then come out of a movie theater, go home and go on with their lives.... This movie deserves an Academy Award, if they ever introduced the category: the most controversial movie of the year.<br/><br/>The most striking quote from the movie is when Christian tells Anastasia, ""You're here because I'm incapable of leaving you alone"". Calling me crazy. Call me confused, but I put this movie right up there with past movies like ""Emanuelle"" and ""Pretty Woman""! Take away the BDSM part of Christian Grey's character and you've got Edward Lewis, a rich entrepreneur, who loves to control every aspect of his life including his women. Yet Anastasia Steele is no Vivian Ward. Here is a strong woman who knows how far she wants to go, yet she is intrigued by how far she wants to go.<br/><br/>I love the final scene! It shows Christian's true shade of gray! His sadistic side is revealed as he whips Ana 6 times enjoying every moment. That part to him is far more appealing than the basic act of sex. And as the door in the elevator shuts Ana's tears only goes to show how much she loves him. His tears goes to show how this young, innocent woman has gotten to him and has begun to change him. <br/><br/>I haven't read the books, but I can only hope that the very ending would actually reveal her 50 shades of Steele ...."

"fabkingcliff","3","1","3","22 May 2015"," The epitome of B movies
","I hadn't reviewed a movie in a long time but after watching this film I felt I had a calling of some sort. <br/><br/>Truly few are the words that can describe the awfulness of Sam- Taylor Johnson's Fifty Shades of Grey. To say it is the epitome of disastrous filmmaking would be bloating it with praise of the highest proportions. I had never before seen the point where bad cinema meets cruel intent. Sure you can make a mediocre film about the Holocaust but with good intention, now imagine making one that is both mediocre and ill-intentioned simultaneously. I shall not waste time pointing out how much Fifty Shades of Grey sur- objectifies women nor shall I speak of its implication that women are so intellectually inept as to willingly (and pleasurably) go through what Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) did with modern psychopath Grey (Jamie Dornan). This film ranges somewhere between modern day pornography with a side of story, a soft-core rape marathon and quasi necrophilia.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the dialogue. Who wrote this screenplay? A sexually frustrated 40 year old with a drinking problem living in his parents' basement whose hobbies include ordering porn and food at the same time? The dialogue and acting of everyone in this 'movie' are so terrible that it wouldn't tax the smarts of a troglodyte. No pun intended dear screenwriter.<br/><br/>I feel as if every single line written for the character Anastasia is intended to humiliate all women around the world. From her conformity with the most absurd thing I have ever heard of my entire life; a horrific contract about how she was basically going to be turned into a living sex toy (worse than that I believe) to her embarrassing submissive retorts to any of Grey's deranged suggestions or should I say condescending orders. The entire time I was looking at actress Dakota Johnson thinking why are they making you say this? Why are they making you act this way? Surely she knows deep down that she was insulting her female companions with everything she did and said. This is truly a feminist's worst nightmare and I am NOT one. <br/><br/>At the end of the day you are left wondering why Anastasia was willing to accept such humiliation and morally degrading experience. Clearly she wasn't really interested in Grey's money. If you say its because of his physique I'm sure there are more attractive men that aren't even worth suffering for to that point either. If you say it was pure love then I don't know in what cosmos and dimension this could possibly be considered as such. So you are left with the knowledge that no, maybe she was simply meant to go through this and she is supposed to enjoy it. Like all other women. That's the film's concealed agenda.<br/><br/>The strangest thing however is the number of women who actually loved this film and even went so far as to call it- (I'm gagging at the simple thought) romantic. A documentary on the war history of Afghanistan and Syria combined would be more romantic than Fifty Shades of Grey. A biopic of the most notorious serial killer and his 15 year sex slave would convey more romance. A presentation on wild life copulation habits of rhesus monkeys on Animal Planet or Discovery Chanel would be a better contender for romance. <br/><br/>How can a sadomasochistic hedonist like Christian Grey be in any way attractive let alone even remotely romantic? Oh right he is a young billionaire with luxury homes and sports cars who seems to be king in the kingdom of Earth so his deranged behavior is acceptable. He does not appear to have a single specter of brain matter inside his skull but once again his bank account justifies. Never mind wondering how he got all that money in the first place anyway. He is used to having his way (classic rich family heir) and his immoral obsessions are justified by a cheesy hint on his childhood. In a nutshell, Fifty Shade of Grey is simply one of the worst movies you will ever come across and that's a compliment.<br/><br/>I cannot imagine what the book could possibly be like if the screenplay adapted from it is this horrendously devastatingly insultingly pathetic. I used to hear people say ""I want my life back, I want the 2 hours back that they stole from me!"" after watching a classic B movie and I didn't really know what they were talking about, that is until I saw Fifty Shades of horrible. Now I want those 120 minutes back right now! But let's not cry over spilt milk what happened has, unfortunately, happened. <br/><br/>The only truly sad thing is the kind of things that sell off today's audiences. Especially the female ones. Toss in a handsome/sexy leading male (no one cares about the one who is representing women so don't mind giving her a brain), give that man unlimited corporate power and sexual prowess then throw in raunchy disturbing sex scenes that appear to consume 70% of the screen time. There, your movie is sold. But that's just classical romantic B movie. Fifty shades of Grey is that plus moral torture, the nec plus ultra of misogyny and all other things synonymic to that, borderline sexism and top notch fetishism.<br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey is a clear indication that some cineastes are insulting us and we are loving it, kind of like what the film portrays itself, sadomasochism. The makers of this film should simply never make films anymore and just sit back and enjoy the work of others like the rest of us."

Well one can't bear this crap..actually crap is also not this crappy. My god what a waste of time and money. The only explanation could be ""This was a boring documentary"". And what about the script, they could not afford a writer, it seems like the actors are improvising in a pathetic manner. I guess they should have spent less of sex weapons and more on the story-line. The only good thing that could result from fifty charades of grey if it comes in exam as topic for the essay..you know because it won't take much of our thinking. Please don't watch it."
"MovieBuff57","9","1","3","10 May 2015"," Tastefully filmed
","Millions of women and a sizeable proportion of the BDSM community would have been on the edge of their seats awaiting this movie's release - I would have imagined? The 'mommy porn' novel sold in the multi-millions and the box office receipts will justify sequels 2 & 3, so why the lacklustre ratings here on IMDb?? Secretary scores 7.1 and is broadly similar in theme?<br/><br/>I thought this film did justice to the book and perhaps even elevated it to a higher level? Whereas EL James has been lambasted for her literary failings (perhaps unfairly?) the screenwriters here have refined the dialog perfectly. <br/><br/>Christian had Ana googling ""submissive"" to learn more about what he was expecting from her. Had she typed in BDSM she may well have run a mile in the opposite direction! The whole BDSM spectrum ranges from 'playful' spanking to scarier elements of skin stretching, mutilation, genital piercing, real torture and - very probably - non-consensual 'play'.<br/><br/>The 'play' in this movie is broadly left of centre in this spectrum. Clearly, Christian would be aghast at the thought of hurting or harming his beloved Anastasia - hence the safe-words to terminate any session? I doubt whether he inflicted a punishment ""as bad as it gets"" as Ana had requested as he had some scary looking bull-whips amongst his 'toys' which would definitely have had our poor Ana running several miles in the other direction!<br/><br/>The only nit I would pick from the novel to film screenplay was the thoughtful gift that Ana had bought for the man who had everything? The book had her giving him a helicopter model of his beloved charlie tango chopper? Why was this changed to a glider? Granted, the glider scenes on screen were more dramatic...<br/><br/>Sequels 2 & 3 would seem to be in the planning stage according to IMDb? The challenge for the money-men and film-makers will be the prequel?? How does a 21 year old young man coming out of a submissive relationship become the head of his own billionaire empire in a mere 6 years??"
"Jerghal","6","1","3","2 May 2015"," Twilight is still worse
","Saw this to see what all the fuss was all about. The smart marketing guys and galls at Universal targeted this flick at women coz it opened at Valentine's Day and women crave roman at this time. This film is supposed to be romantic -and it sort of is- but at the same time it incorporates BDSM into the storyline (trust me, there is no BDSM in this film, very soft porn at best maybe) which is always good for controversy and to spike curiosity. A lot of criticism on this film was about the lead actress not being a strong female character, but that argument is moot. This film is supposed to be a female fantasy of a strong dominant rich alpha male who sweeps them of their feet. But it also tries to sell the not entirely convincing story of a tormented man with a socially unaccepted obsession. There is another film on this subject called 'Secretary' which did a lot better job at telling this story. I won't spoil anything but there is a comical scene (it's not intended to be funny) about a contract negotiation where words are used you normally don't hear in American mainstream cinema. So maybe we should be commending them in not trying to make a romantic comedy done a 1000 times before but do something a bit more dramatic. The problem is that it's not convincing, the dialogue is sometimes poorly written and it's basically a movie with an identity crisis, it tries to be more things than it is. they should have either gone full-out dramatic and focused on the story and made it darker and less mainstream or made it a flatout romance. In any case, it's not as bad as those twilight movies were and Dakota Johnson is quite nice to look at."

I enjoyed the acting, I think both were very believable in presenting their characters. Without reading the book, I did not even feel that there were a lot of sex scenes. I am curious to learn more about the past of Christian Grey to understand his behavior and need to control things. Personally, I don't understand the negativity around this movie and especially towards the actors. It's a movie and a form of entertaining for people to escape their own reality for a moment, nothing wrong with that. Hopefully, there will be second part to this movie."

Though in the first half Dakota kept on constantly reminding me of Kristen Stewart's extremely irritating vague confusing too much underplaying. And I liked Jamie Dornan way better in Once Upon a Time. In here, his tone sounded as if he is trying too hard to suppress his Irish accent but he did succeed in projecting Christian's magnetism as it has been described, though I wish the leads had a better chemistry. The movie is pretty faithful to the book, though. All in all, I think the fans of the book will find worth watching it at least once."
"Alliejarvis1","6","1","3","10 March 2015"," Fans of the book will be satisfied! Urge non book readers to either have a brief!
","So I've just watched the film and felt as this review is fresh and I should post it ASAP!<br/><br/>OKAY, if you have not read the book it's X-rated sort of messed up romantic film with a lot of important bits cut out. But bare in mind the book has a lot more sex than the film. I thought it may all be porn but it turned out they managed to harvest the storyline well.<br/><br/>There are in fact three books and this film is book one, so don't get caught up with - god what was the point in that and blah blah. The first book gets you to enjoy the character of Anastacia and Christian and how he is basically the bad guy gone good as most romantic heart throb men are in good films typically, when they then meet ""the one girl"" that changes them forever. But you realise Christian has that little edge to him. <br/><br/>I personally was disappointed with Christian Grey's actor as he's not the charmer I imagined him to be in the book. I thought Anastacia was good, Dakota was brilliant, so real, so normal, I cannot even begin to imagine how much of a challenge this was to make as an actor. Yet I did grow to like them both more, but maybe because I know the characters already I already liked them.<br/><br/>I wanted so much more though. The book isn't written well but it is addictive, sort of like when you get hooked on reality TV and you don't know why. <br/><br/>I did love the books, honestly. It made me think about how funny and strange relationships are, I felt as though Fifty Shades the film kind of sums up what loving someone is really like, you'd do anything for them even if it means being hurt physically or mentally. As a woman it's hard to submit to a man, and when you fall, you fall hard. I enjoyed watching Anastacia fight her her needs and wants in the relationship, and not conforming. As my favourite film Gone Girl explains e.g. The style of music a woman likes and the way they dress will have a lot to do with what their partner likes. I hurt for Anastacia in this film, I wanted it to be clich√© I think that's why I needed to write this, because secretly everyone likes a clich√© ending.<br/><br/>I mean think about it, if you were Anna what would you do? You'd play it like she did... A billionaire falling for you? Buying you amazing gifts...? You'd be shocked. You'd be flattered. But someone who wanted do that to you... You'd run. But love works in mysterious ways. Doesn't it?"
"jamisona","6","1","3","8 March 2015"," The book was terrible..but the movie was not half bad
","Spoilers ahead<br/><br/>I was surprised by the movie. Considering the toilet paper source material they had to work with, I actually enjoyed a lot of the movie. Not enjoyed in the sense that I found it erotic - this story cannot in good conscience be called a romance. It's clearly a drama about an abusive relationship.<br/><br/>Dakota Johnson plays a charming Ana - quiet but very ballsy, and despite her inexperience and considerable manipulation on Christian's part, manages to hold her own a number of times. I think she's an excellent heroine because even though she gets caught up in Christian's web, she never stops fighting to maintain her integrity, and eventually has the courage and dignity to end the relationship.<br/><br/>People have criticized Jamie Dornan's performance as ""childish"" and not particularly sexy, but whether it was his intention or not, he portrayed Christian as an immature, manipulative and selfish man, and this is exactly what Christian is. So I think he got it spot on. He's a decidedly unlikable person and clearly the villain of the story.<br/><br/>It was also said that Dakota and Jamie lacked chemistry, but I think this works to their advantage. You can clearly see how sad and turned off Ana is in the ""Red Room"", and it's heart breaking when she and Christian argue about why he feels like he has to hurt her. It's as if the actors are tuned in to how messed up the whole situation is and portray it accordingly. <br/><br/>Ana is constantly fighting for a healthy, loving relationship - with physical affection, romance, and emotional intimacy - while Christian fights just as hard for an emotionally and physically abusive ""contract"", hiding behind his money and his terrible past. For fans of the book the movie might be a downer and a disappointment, but for people that never found the book sexy to begin with, it's a decent drama and explores some interesting psychological concepts.<br/><br/>Lastly, I must give mad props to the music by Danny Elfman and other various artists. The soundtrack earns the movie a whole star all by itself, and made every scene that much richer and more dramatic."

","I give this film a 6 because maybe I'm biased. I have always read erotic fan fiction involving my favourite celebrities. I favour the writing skills of the authors and how they emotionally engage the (mostly female) audience.<br/><br/>I admit I never read the books of Fifty Shades Of Grey as I shun from overly hyped books.<br/><br/>However, through the hype of this film, I found out about the BDSM aspect of this sexy drama/romance and, being a red blooded female, was drawn to it. I also found the idea of an average but cute young woman being prayed upon by a perverted man sexy and exciting. Maybe I'm just weird.<br/><br/>The sex and nudity (mostly altered for the screen as the original content in the book is graphic) is nothing too explicit. I had seen hotter scenes in older erotic movies.<br/><br/>That said, Dakota Johnson makes a very lovely literature student, Anastasia Steele, changed into a sexual woman by perverted and mysterious Christian Gray (played by Jamie Dornan).<br/><br/>The problem is with Jamie Dornan, who could have made his Christian character more intimidating and cold but seemed to lack the motivation to do so. At least Dakota did a fine job of portraying a young, innocent woman who is romantically lured to the mysterious Christian.<br/><br/>An almost ordinary drama, but cute and highly watchable. It's worth the hype."

","Well the media PR around this film has been genius, as the film certainly lacked the wow I thought it would have. The leads had chemistry but in honesty I felt short changed watching this. There was little depth to Grey, he was too smiley and smooth by far and he kept launching back to his Irish accent that was distracting. Dakota Johnson held her own, bringing more to the character than Dornan but you can't really get away from the story itself - naive virgin becomes sex goddess overnight and takes on a depraved perverted older guy without flinching!! The filming itself was very arty, and used beautiful locations but if I hadn't know it was Sam Taylor-Johnson directing, I would have thought it was made by a man for men to watch given the proportion of Johnson's nudity to Dornan's. Overall it was very very lacking, and it falls down to the fact the books were over rated and over hyped with no substance and that's what translated to screen."
"inessavalueva","8","1","3","1 March 2015"," Much Ado about Nothing
","My summary may seem like a contrast to my vote, but they are in perfect balance. There was so much talk about how bad the movie is that I had to go see if it was really true. It's not. Let's me explain why. One half of the world accuses it of being perverse. Have you seen Nymphomaniac? FSG is beautifully made even if you don't compare it to anything. Adult movies are supposed to provoke lust, erotic movies are supposed to arouse, this one does neither. FSG teases your senses and takes your breath away, because the sex scenes are not too long and not too short, but perfectly timed and purely beautiful. The other half of the world accuses it of being cheesy and trite. My question is, how many romcoms did you see? If you liked any of them, you're lying about this movie: FSG is deeper than a romcom. If you don't like romcoms, this movie is just not your taste, stop chastising it. A lot of people hated Twilight, but a lot of people loved it, which didn't make the movie any better or worse. I read the books, I wasn't the fan of them, I was prepared to be disappointed when I went to the cinema (purely out of curiosity and love for art). Like many reviewers on this site, I was pleasantly surprises. Dakota is natural in her take on Ana's character, Jamie showed an amazing transformation from a cute guy he is in life to the cold and domineering Christian. The music is the best part of the movie, the pictures are spectacular. There's humor, love, romance, love, nice ending. I wish some of the dialogs had been better thought through, and some of the secondary story lines had been a bit less vague, but those didn't stop me from enjoying the movie. A friend of mine said the movie is about making contracts. I think it's rather about trust (not unlike any relationship, including the contractual ones). Ana is free in her concept of a relationship, she's familiar with all things spiritual from literature and she has this romanticized notion of what life with a man should be like (watching her mother, her friend, reading books), but she fears physical pain. Christian is free in terms of physical things (except for his issue with touching), there's almost nothing he can't do sexually, but he fears normal relationships, he has complexes in the spiritual world. So these two people come together and realize: she has to trust him physically, he has to trust her emotionally. This is where it all goes haywire, because trusting another human being is extremely hard. This movie, like any piece of art, deserves a deeper look (a lot of research lies behind the story to the credit of E.L. James). Feel free to hate it, you're making it notorious, hence popular, hence commercially viable. But feel free to love it too, no one has a right to make your opinion for you."
"xtbsxrosex","7","1","3","1 March 2015"," Its not as bad as most of these review express!
","This is coming from the perspective of someone who has not read the books. I'm giving this movie a 7 out of 10 because it really was average for me. It wasn't horrible and wasn't amazing. First of all, if you're not comfortable watching sex scenes, especially ones that involve S&M, then don't watch this movie. In my opinion, the sex scenes weren't as raunchy as I expected, but I can see how some could get offended when watching it. About the acting: The acting was not amazing.. the main reason why I gave it a 7 out of 10. Jamie Dornan (Christian Grey) is not the right actor for the part. He struggled capturing the character's tortured soul essence. He also struggled with the American accent. He's not a bad actor but they definitely needed someone more intense for this role. Dakota Johnson's (Anastasia Steele) acting was not too bad. She seemed like a great fit for the part. The two of them together lacked chemistry and I think this is because of the lack of performance from Jamie Dornan. There were many lines in the movie that were very cheesy and acted out very poorly..they were probably lines that were taken directly from the book..not really meant to be acted out. What I like about the movie: I like that this is not your typical love story. It is very different from any other romance film. After watching the movie, I'm curious about what happens in the next two books. Overall: I would give this movie a shot if you're curious about it. Its really not as bad as most of the reviews express. Its not going to be the best movie you've ever seen and it won't be the worst."

","I have read the books. And I have to admit, I didn't enjoy the books as much as I enjoyed the movie. First of all, let's talk about the casting. I think Dakota Johnson did a nice job. She's kind of what I imagined Ana to be. Jamie Dornan on the other hand isn't... I like him as an actor, and I think he did great. But the way he looks just doesn't fit in my opinion. He seems to sweet. No problem for anyone who hasn't read the books, though.<br/><br/>I thought the film was quite alright, actually. It was definitely not too dark and heavy like I expected from everyone's reviews. Ana is bubbly and funny, which is not at all the way she seemed in the books. When it comes to the sex part, as long as you're okay with a bit of boob and pubic hair here and there, it's not that provocative. Of course there's the topic of BDSM, but I think it's not shown like a terrible form of physical abuse like I've read here. It didn't seem disturbing to me.<br/><br/>I thought it was a romantic, funny and easy movie that's perfectly appropriate to watch on a girl's night or a movie night with your boy/girlfriend"

","I've just the watched the movie, all of my friend suggested, not to see it.But I was curious, I read all the books, which were really great. So I thought, why not, can't be so bad. I won't say it was a waste of time, but I've seen much better movies. It wasn't boring or something like that, I just felt something is missing.But I wish I could say what was it.I think that is not the fault of the actors.But the soundtracks were awesome, they did a great work!

"Tactrix","6","1","3","28 February 2015"," Two Major Problems
","This movie was butchered but in a very specific way. First it became a silent film in all the areas where it mattered, that was a colossal mistake. They should have made Ana narrate everything she was thinking, kind of like they did in Dexter, but instead they did.. nothing. So what ends up happening is, all the moments that would be described in great detail with thoughts and feelings are left unexplained. Of course no one who's never read the books would understand what was going on.<br/><br/>Now on to the second massive blunder, the reason why the book was so fluid and worked so well is because of the encounter context, as in we put these specific people here and then make this situation play out in a way in which it makes her seem insecure and quirky(not shy and sad). Then and only then does the situation make sense and works. In the movie they did NONE of that. They took creative license but instead of cutting a few parts they shredded them all and made the encounters bland and tense. Case and point in the first couple of minutes in the movie, there was suppose to be an internal dialog where she's weirder out by all the blonde women on the way in, there's an entire section that brings out her insecurity and really gets the people to feel the emotion but instead there's none of that. They just skipped it entirely and went on with the movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line this is just bad writing, whoever butchered this script needs to be fired and replaced with a person who understand the concept of writing, and can actually execute it without being held by the hand and directed around the playground like a child. 6/10 because the acting was pretty good despite the god awful script."

","50 Shades of Grey is an erotic drama directed by Sam Taylor Johnson and stars Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson. Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) is a student attending Washington State University who is asked by her best friend Kate (Eloise Mumford) to fill in for her and do an interview at the office of business man Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan).<br/><br/>However, Ana finds the handsome Christian a distraction, which results in the interview going badly. Ana puts it down to experience and returns to her usual day to day life, which includes a job at an hardware store. Ana's day is suddenly turned upside down, when, to her surprise, in walks Christian, who starts to search the shop for Masking Tape, Cable Ties, Rope. Ana tells Christian that Kate would like a few photos to go with the questionnaire that she had left at his office and he had secretly filled in. Christian gives her his phone number in order to arrange a photo shoot.<br/><br/>The next day, Ana, Kate and Jose, their photographer friend, meet Christian at his hotel. Christian begins to show more than just a casual interest in Ana and asks her out for a coffee. Ana is surprised to learn that he to his single. Christian tells her how he enjoys the company of woman, but he is in no way a romantic. However, Christian later sends Ana a gift of some very rare and priceless books.<br/><br/>Ana is flattered, but feels completely out of Christian's league and considers giving the books back. That night, a drunken Ana phones Christian, who decides to go and pick her up from the club and takes her back to his hotel. They arrange to go on another date, which includes an helicopter flight to his apartment. Once there, Christian insists she agrees to sign a contract, which prevents her from talking in any way to anyone about their times together. It also contains some very strange demands, that make it clear, that their relationship will be purely sexual and based on his dominance and her submission.<br/><br/>So Ana, who was previously a virgin, now finds herself in a very complex and steamy relationship, a relationship were she's expected to be nothing more than a willing and submissive partner."
"DTLindaGross","4","1","3","26 February 2015"," Dakota Johnson is the sole reason to see this movie.
","Dakota? She is absolutely fantastic! I hope they put her in every movie for the next 10 years. She is a delightful combination of Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn. She is innocent and seductive at the same time. Quite an unusual combination for today's young actresses. In unexpected scenes, she delivers her dose of 'feisty' which captures our imagination. Well done! <br/><br/>Reasons this movie didn't make it... <br/><br/>1. Jamie Dornan. He is kind of a drip. I realize he is meant to be all business, but instead of being a drip, he should have been 'ruthless'. At least that would have been more engaging.<br/><br/>I hear that he wants to drop out of the sequels because his wife doesn't approve of the kind of movie this is. First off, why are you doing what your wife says when it comes to business? Pussy. Secondly, didn't your wife know what kind of movie this is PRIOR to signing the contract? This insecurity translates to the screen. If the script calls for you to be a dominant man (both in business and in bed), you have to have that element in your personal life to tap into the role properly.<br/><br/>2. The guy is supposed to be drop-dead gorgeous. Although his abs get perfect 10's, his face is Not all that cute, in fact, in many camera angles, he is downright ugly. If he is going to be an a*hole, at least make it a face that we are glued to.<br/><br/>If Dornan drops out, I vote for Ryan Serhant, of Bravo's Million Dollar Listing to step in. He is ruthless in business, has great abs, and is cute from all angles.<br/><br/>3. I realize this movie is about being a sex slave. In general, most women are not into that. I know the definition of 'slave' means you are subservient to your master's requests. For that, it is hard to watch a movie where the sex fetishes are only for him. It is lop-sided and painful to watch. You have to wonder what is in it for her? OK, so he acquiesced to take her out on a date once a week. That's huge. I should call in a brass band.<br/><br/>Sure the movie is about being a sex slave, but you have to be mindful of who your audience is. Your audience is female. You have to give them something. You either have to have her use her beguiling ways to turn some of the fetishes back on him (make him the slave, in a not-so-obvious way. It cannot be an obvious way, as that is male energy. It has to be in a non-direct (beguiling) way which is feminine energy. I know, I know, this is a lost art, but hey, the author sold 100 million books. Figure it out! Another way to give something to the female viewers (since we don't get turned on the same way as men do) is to present something that turns her on. When I was single, I had a phone relationship with someone who was a sex addict (with zero interest in a relationship). He was very sharp to know that the sexes are different. He would scour the internet to bring me something that might turn me on. By bringing me something to get worked up on, I would be more willing to give him something he needed. Since most fetishes are for men, I found that the things that turned me on were things that didn't do a thing for the guy. Yay! The spotlight was on me...as it should be.<br/><br/>4. Art direction/filming. I saw the same scene over and over again and I got bored. Film it in a different way. Focus on breast, pan down to the lowest point just prior to filming the vagina, then cut away. Come on, this happened at least 6 times in the same way. Figure out other angles to film her naked.<br/><br/>The good about this shot is that I think Dakota will be solely responsible for making small breasts 'in'. Yay! Someone needs to reverse the trend for fake boobs. Her breasts are delicious.<br/><br/>5. The ending pisses the viewer off. The woman behind me came this close to throwing her soda at the screen. All of us felt the same way. Have an abrupt ending? Sure. Have an ending where there are loose ends? Sure. Have an ending that teases the viewer? Sure. There are dozens of ways the movie could have ended. I'm sure pissing them off isn't one of them. I don't know how you expect the viewer to come back (for two more installments) if you tick them off. It would be like going to a nice restaurant and knowing that the chef put a bodily fluid in your food. I don't care how good the meal was. It's not going to allure you to return.<br/><br/>See the movie because of Miss Johnson, replace Dornan, and make the script alluring to women and you will double your sales. Of course, this movie already made 400 million dollars in 10 days (with a 40 million dollar budget). The bean counters don't make changes when the cash registers are ringing. I really wanted to like this movie, but in its current state, it's not working."
"octaviohjr27","8","1","3","20 February 2015"," Honest, Open Minded Review;. You'll either love this movie or not. Simple.
","First and foremost I have not read the books myself but I already knew beforehand what I was going to expect. Furthermore I'm only writing this review because it amazes me the amount of Ignorance in these reviews.... Listen this movie is not bad not amazing either but is a good movie all around. Yes it has sex. Wow sex.. so bad!!! I honestly hate that people associate sex with disrespect or ''disgusting'' or should be only viewed or discussed behind closed doors. We were all created due to sex.. we all were born naked, we are all human. We all have sex. Embrace your body, love it. This film is not entirely just about the sex, its just part of it, the film is honestly not your typical love story. Its a very complicated,bizarre love story with intriguing complex characters that are not the typical clich√© love birds. Of course this is what I interpret since I have not read the books but more or less what I'm trying to come across is that this movie is not what you may think it is. DON'T JUDGE A FILM BY ITS TRAILER OR GO ALONG ON THE BANDWAGON OF HATE. <br/><br/>Starting off with the movie itself, I really liked both Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey maybe not the actor for Christian Grey but Ill get into that later. Starting with Anna she did at first annoy me in the first 15 mins due to how dorky and her all around shy personality is but I soon really like her as the movie progressed. Now onto Christian.... oh Christian was it certainly mind boggling to truly understand you as a character and as a viewer not reading the books personally, even though his causes to be into BDSM will be exposed in the next 2 films.. He's truly a character that you really need to read the books to understand fully... BUT here's where the film excelled for me.. not reading the book still, made me understand about them, knowing that there is still more to cover you still get a concept of who they are and knowing they have more to them. I've always said a movie based on a book should stand on its own, appealing to both audiences: readers (such as some of my friends who enjoyed it) and to non readers like me, who enjoyed it as well. That's why I really did enjoy his character,from a non readers point of view, I was like what the fug is up with him!? I want to live his life LOL minus the really kinky stuff but the billionaire at a young age, yes please! LOL anyways I was really fascinated all around with Christian and Anastasia. I really want to see both on screen more. The movie did a good job giving you a insight of both characters, giving them good bulid up yet leaving you with questions that will be answered in the next films. The transitions from scenes were good, and was really visually intriguing and stunning (The red room of pain with the xbox LOL and the the emphasis on certain body movements and locations and the way Christian is very ''neat'') (The film is part of a 3 novel trilogy that IS going to be made into movies regardless of all these really ignorant reviews). <br/><br/>The actors themselves now.. Starting off with Dakota Johnson (Anastasia) she really fit the role good, it came off naturally. I sometimes believed she was a virgin at first LOL acting done right? hahaha joking.. but seriously I applaud her on all levels, acting and mostly on the actual nudity.. I do not in anyway want to sound sexist or perverted but here's why I had a issue with Jamie Dornan being casted as Christian Grey.. The movie obviously revolves around the chemistry between both and BDSM that Christain does with Anastasia.. yet Jamie Dornan never went full frontal like Dakota did.. Its honestly absurd. Its like watching a War movie with 2 characters while only one shoots his gun on camera and the other one doesn't (No pun intended)He knew coming into the movie, skin was to be shown. Why sign a ''contract'' to not show anything and boy let me tell you he has STUNT DOUBLES in some sex scenes I promise you this! You can easily tell when its not him. Jamie is necessarily not the perfect Christian but you it is what it is. Just hoping by the 2nd film he gets some sense to actually stick to a role and do allll of its requirements. Christian sounds to me better on paper even though I didn't read the book. <br/><br/>Final thought: I give this film a 8/10. It doesn't hold back and honestly has more then meets the eye. Please drop the ignorance. Come into the film open minded and don't just base/review it on the obvious. <br/><br/>P.S I felt that they should have shown more of Ana and her roommate Kate, she seemed like a cool girl lol <br/><br/>There you have it a honest review from a non reader and open minded film viewer and now fan waiting for the next release!"
"medekfan","Null","1","3","22 February 2015"," Review from someone who's read the book
","I'm not sure if I've reviewed a movie on here before, but I felt compelled to review this one and I will explain why.<br/><br/>In reading other people's reviews, both user and critic, it seems the poor reviews and ratings are largely because of the story. People have issues with the story. I've read the book and seen the movie and I think the movie is an accurate reflection of the book. Things that occur in the book are disturbing, it is hard to fathom why a woman would agree to them, yet that is the book. That's I thought reading the book and so that in the movie doesn't surprise me and seems accurate.<br/><br/>It's people's right to review the movie as a standalone entity and comment on how people might enjoy it, but for my review I want to review it based on the quality of the adaption from the book. That is, for those who've read the book, know the story and what they think of that already, they might want to know how the movie compares and if the adaption is any good.<br/><br/>The story in the book is difficult to convince people to enjoy given it is not what most people, including myself, would think was romantic or OK. This is something the movie team would have had to deal with in how people would feel about the movie. On top of that it's complex to translate the story to the screen in a non-hard core sense given the subject matter. You really have to tread a line between being explicit enough and not taking it too far. The other thing they need to convey is the internal war she has her being horrified but liking aspects of it as well. I thought they handled it all and found that balance pretty well.<br/><br/>The first thing they have to do, is convince the viewer there is enough chemistry and attraction between Anastasia and Christian for Anastasia to even consider agreeing to this. They've had no dating romance, they don't know much of anything about each other, so it's all on attraction. I thought they did this well, in my opinion I thought this part felt as or more romantic than the book.<br/><br/>The disturbing things she participates in are more disturbing in the book. The movie seemed to find a way to mix in a bit more sensuality to it than I felt reading the book. It had to have some of the horror to be that story.<br/><br/>Some might say then don't make the movie if it has these issues but the book was so talked about they were bound to want to. If this studio didn't then another likely would.<br/><br/>I thought what they selected to leave out versus put in the movie was fairly appropriate.<br/><br/>So as an adaption, I thought they did well. While the acting wasn't Oscar worthy, I thought the acting was fine, the lead actress particularly I thought she did well especially given the bravery required. A couple of moments seemed a little corny or awkward but otherwise overall I enjoyed it and I would watch it again.<br/><br/>If you've read the books and didn't dislike them then I think it's a worthy watch."
"jhl-arn","7","1","3","22 February 2015"," Positively surprised
","It was hard (read impossible) to go see that movie with a positive expectation of it, for it seems the entire planet is on a mission to have this movie declared worst picture of the decade. But still I went, watched it until the end and left the movies positively surprised.<br/><br/>I don't understand why so much hate. Both actors come across very well. There are some beautiful city views, the movie is crammed with luxury settings and is overall aesthetically-pleasing. The large amount of nudity in the movie was to be expected. It was handled properly for I watched it without any discomfort at all.<br/><br/>It's no romance story. This picture is about sexual domination. I believe it was a slippery subject, it could have gone wrong in so many ways but they did it right. The script lacks some decent lines and the characters deserved a proper development, especially since they are only two, they could have done so much better on making them deeper and more intriguing.<br/><br/>The score was a bit of a let down. I disliked that they cut the only good song of the movie by The Weeknd. No other music was particularly appealing to my ears in this movie.<br/><br/>Final word, there is obviously a world-wide social phenomenon at work here which makes people hate the movie because so many others have hated it. It's not perfect but I would watch Fifty Shades of Grey again, to me the real sign that it had something. 7/10. If you haven't seen it, don't be a sheep, go see it with an open-mind and decide for yourself. I did just that today and stand against the crowd. It blows my mind that people go so hard against that movie.<br/><br/>If it makes any difference, I haven't read the books and I am a 23 year-old male, for the socio-anthropologists amongst us."
"tkuhl-732-81733","6","1","3","22 February 2015"," Film was okay, but...
","I've read the books part 1 and 2. I've had big problems with the reason why Christian is how he is, because I feel it's a book against BDSM and not for it. Like it's something that has to be cured and rescued from.<br/><br/>The movie is okay for a girl's night/romance movie. They have cut a lot (especially the scene with a slip and the boathouse, which I really liked in the book.) The BDSM scenes were very tame, like to hits with a flogger and that's it.<br/><br/>And sadly, I'm really no fan of Jamie Dornan's performance. He just isn't what I thought of Christian Grey. No charisma, nor nothing. He should be played by someone who can control everything, himself and the room he walks into. Someone who's beautiful, who every woman looks after. Mr. Dornan has none of that and when he moved over Anastasia to sleep with her for the first time, I was nearly laughing, because there was nothing erotic about it. A very bad casting... and did anyone else was confused about his eyes in the first scenes/interview. The right one was always a lot bigger than the left one.<br/><br/>Dakota was okay, but there was supposed to be nothing special about her in the first part, so she couldn't do much wrong."

","Is this movie really better porn for women than Magic Mike?<br/><br/>I get Magic Mike, cause Magic Mike is a movie based on what men want but flip to appeal to women. I did not really get the turn on from 50 Shades.<br/><br/>But it may not be the fault of the content(chains and whips appeal to every woman, right?). The acting was stale. The guy playing Christian Grey was too stiff.<br/><br/>The direction tried to be subtle with it's over the top ness, and it was too much. <br/><br/>I never read the book, but I knew the movie was about S&M. It seem like everything leading up to this point was a series of one liners that act as innuendos and came across funny instead of sexy.<br/><br/>I like it for all the wrong reasons. Found it funny not sexy. All the one liners and innuendos did not make it sexy or dramatic it just had me giggling throughout the whole thing. It's like this generation's Showgirls (Although Jesse Spano naked did something for me that the spawn of Melanie Griffith could not).<br/><br/>But Daykota Johnson was not half bad, I'll give her that. She did innocent girl clich√© effectively. Any fault in her performance was the direction she had to take which made her react to certain situations unnaturally once again for a erotic feel that comes across more humorously.<br/><br/>Director Sam-Taylor Johnson should have got her husband Arron from kick-ass and the upcoming Avengers sequel to play Grey. I can see him as a better choice.<br/><br/>It's true, Dakota and this dude have no chemistry. He always seem distant no matter how close there were suppose to get. I was only turned on by one moment while everything else put a grin on my face and not the blush kind of way but the laughing kind.<br/><br/>Ironically, I say go check it out, if you looking for some laughs"
"sickofenjoyingmyself","5","1","3","21 February 2015"," Not my scene but gave it a fair crack of the whip
","I went to see this movie with my girlfriend who had read the books and wanted to see it. Otherwise I would never have watched it. I did read up before on a lot of negative reviews but decided to give it a fair crack of the whip (sorry about that one). Firstly - it wasn't as bad as it had been made out. I have seen far worse movies overall. The acting wasn't remotely electrifying - but I wouldn't say that it was abysmal or laughable. I think the main stars both actually did OK at trying to give any sort of substance to a frankly ridiculous storyline. I hadn't read the books beforehand so I didn't really know what to expect. For me the whole thing built up to nothing. It's almost as if the S+M sexual scenes were there to throw in a shock factor but stripped down there really wasn't anything else to the story. The whole movie is basically about a rich man with sadomasochistic sexual preferences who takes advantage of a vulnerable young lady who battles internally between her love for him and visions of who she wants him to be, and the loveless, selfish user that he actually is. When she gets in the elevator at the end and eventually leaves the absurd scenario she is in - I would have expected that to be the end of it all. But apparently it's not... Overall I was able to watch it and was absorbed for most of the movie. But the whole time it did feel like I was living in the daydream of some kind of bored librarian/secretary. It was like picking up one of my mum's magazines and reading in the bathroom when I was younger - a mildly amusing insight into a world alien to me - but one that would be forgotten very quickly."

I enjoyed them, they're not masterpieces but are relaxing and easy reading. <br/><br/>However, the movie.. wasn't good.. at all.. but it wasn't that bad everyone says. They tried too much to include all events in the book and I felt like I was watching pieces of the story put together without being linked. Everything was rushed and I thought that if I hadn't read the books I would have been very confused with the story and the events. <br/><br/>Other problems with the actors.. I liked the way they played their roles but I don't know why I couldn't feel enough chemistry. Also, Anastasia wasn't as communicative as she is in the book.

In my local movie theater they told me that all shows are sold out. So the film is controversial.<br/><br/>What is it about it that it makes it so controversial? I think it is the plot which is actually talking about new addiction to internet porn. Man, I had a feeling that I was watching a longer video from xhamster.com. Actually, a very long version of it. Since internet became so widely available, so did pornography of all kinds is easier to watch. Before it was not so easy to obtain porn so widely, now it is easy. So this plot reflects this new phenomena.<br/><br/>Acting was OK, although not excellent, so it fits well in the grade I gave it.<br/><br/>All in all, since this film is catered towards younger audiences I would recommend them to go and see for themselves do they like it or not. For you older ones not really."

","You should know what to expect and it may not be as bad as you expected. It's in focus, has an interesting score and may not be taking itself too seriously. Dakota Johnson is excellent as Anastasia. If you close your eyes and just listen you'll hear the same voice of Melanie Griffith, her mom.<br/><br/>Other then Anastasia all the other characters are strained and wooden. On occasions when Grey sits down to tell his story, the scenes are unintentionally laughable. There are crater size holes in the script. Anastasia has to go see her mother, the reason, never explained. Grey has a business reason he must get back, why bother to write it? There is something in his past that doesn't allow him to be touched? There's some reference to burns but that makes no sense.<br/><br/>Basically it' the story of a young girl and her pervert stalker. Like most comedies this plays best when shared with a theater audience. The ending leaves plenty of room for a sequel."
"monstermayhem32","7","1","3","16 February 2015"," Faithful adaptation but missing some sizzle
","While I will say that making the fifty shades of grey film would be rather difficult task because of the sex scenes and the dialogue in addition to the mixed message the film sends about female empowerment and abuse. Anyway the story of the film has English literature student Ana Steele who ends up with the chance of a lifetime interview when she gets the chance to talk to Christian grey a billionaire of grey enterprises when her roommate Kate is sick. It becomes a love at first sight for the duo who become smitten with each other. I will say that one of the strongest aspects of the film was the casting of dakota Johnson who plays off Ana as someone who is charming, funny, and likable. However I felt the weak link was jamie dorman who looks like he is having a difficult time easying into the role. While the sex scenes were not as graphic as the box, but I will say the film does a decent job at putting together a decent adaptation."
"trepessa","10","2","10","24 November 2015"," Sensuality, humor, control, BDSM
","I knew when I came here that some would say this movie was bad but I totally disagree. I'm a senior and I have seen hundreds of movies and I know the subject matter somewhat even though I was never involved in it. I had to do research for writing projects. The movie is tame to say the least and explores the relationship of these two people who enter into a very unusual bond that most people never experience in their lifetimes or even know much about.<br/><br/>Those that have said it was awful didn't watch the same movie I did. The movie is very sensual and the male lead does a superb job showing how he has kept his emotions in check. Some of it dealt with the abuse from childhood before he was adopted by the Grey family. His drive and detachment were excellent for being a successful businessman. He isn't the most attractive man but this actor has a presence that is unmistakable. The two actors had a lot of charisma between them. They showed it in their body language and facial expressions. I have known a couple of men very much like this one but I didn't have a relationship with them on this level but I recognized the personality type and was amused all through the film. Most don't know about this side of life that is not so underground anymore.<br/><br/>Christian is naturally very controlling and becomes obsessed by Ana (for some reason Alison stuck with me even though that wasn't the character's name) He recognized her naivet√© and purity and it made him want her more. This is a romance he has a hard time accepting because he was always able to keep himself removed from any feelings. Ana grew on him and he respected her, desired her and by the end of the movie was in love with her but still wouldn't admit to it. She couldn't accept the dark side of him and in the end breaks it off. I was memorized by the movie. I think too many people these days are jaded. It is the heavy romance movies that have a darker side to them that they bash. I'm sorry but this was an excellent movie going into what drives people and their emotions and how Christian Grey begins to awaken to another path in life. The movie ends at that point. I haven't read the books which I understand are far more graphic and violent but the movie is not. I loved it."

So anyway,she freaks out gets drunk and calls him, he rescues her blah blah blah hes rich okay I getit he likes to beat it up ""literally"" its a lot of tying up in the movie from my perspective, I think people didn't like it because it is too far beyond the reach of the average person's reality. This guy is rich beyond belief, hot and sexy, and he knows what he wants..totallynormal right? NO! he gets his jollies by seeing women in pain. So the movie ends with her crying in the elevator as she leaves his gigantic house. I honestly was a little confused because I thought she loved being tied up, I swear that happened like 5 times, its just the pain she didn't like lol. In a way I guess you can consider it a fantasy romance for both the man and woman. The man wants to just play around whipping people all day. I seriously hope the second movie gets better because I don't appreciate seeing a woman get beat for 2 hours...and thats my story and IM sticking to it! Clamped her down is what he did! LOL he put it down girllllllll I want to see #2. I don't see what everyone is worked up for, please stop getting so worked up about it!

More than this, the most curios thing that everybody says that this movie is piece of ""S#$%"" but watch(ed) it. It is totally the same when everybody told that they not eat in a junk food restaurants and in a real those cars usually in the evening time on a drive way. Same thing even about adult movies, nobody watched them but people who create them get pretty much good income. <br/><br/>Most of people assume that this movie and book is fail and shame. However in reality this movie is one of the best example of success and enormous profit.<br/><br/>P.S: I think if director (Sam Taylor-Johnson) would use some parts and nuances of the movie structure from the movie ""Addicted"" (2014) made by Bille Woodruff. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" would get more than 4. Maybe 6 or even might be 7 stars!"

Apart from the two main leads, every other character is instantly forgettable and two dimensional. The ""dippy girl meets billionaire"" scenario seems to be a ripoff of Pretty Woman and the spanking is a discount Secretary.<br/><br/>But on the plus side, Dakota Johnson does her best to carry the film with some half decent acting. The movie has managed to make something of the appalling writing of the books. The cinematographer is generally well done.

","This is a dull, boring, one-note movie. There is nothing at all interesting about it, except perhaps the sets! The plot plods. Most of the scenes are monotonous, repetitive, and the actors seem to be sleep-walking through the script. I was totally disinterested in the two major characters. They both seemed lifeless. In terms of the plot, everyone by now knows what it's about, but what bothered me was that the very premise of a relationship with Grey was not completed and yet the relationship proceeded. This was contradictory, unexplained, and didn't seem to fit the character of Grey at all. Perhaps this is better brought out in the book, but here, it just makes for a very confusing impression of one of the main characters. At several points Grey makes a point about his sleeping pattern, for example, but then completely contradicts himself by doing what he says he never does. Is this supposed to depict a person in turmoil, in conflict? In transition? To me, it just seemed like an inconsistency in character depiction. I kept checking the time to see how much longer I had to endure this film."

Mickey Rourke did everything right to pull us in. Fifty Shades of Grey was garbage. The two stars I gave it are only for the decent soundtrack. I was able to stomach reading the first book and it was better than the movie, but that's not saying much. Dakota was a good choice to cast Anastasia, but Jamie Dornan was so unbelievable as Christian. He was boring. Just boring.

Dorman should be commended for holding the same faceless, unemotional expression with insanity behind the eyes for 2 hours.

Her acting was actually pretty impressive. The way she portrayed innocence turned me on, even though I didn't find her very attractive at first. But the moment she started talking and posing, she became irresistible. She definitely knows how to activate prehistoric instincts of a typical man.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, paid parrots did what they usually do.

They manage to throw out some terms loosely, such as nipple clamps, anal fisting, vaginal fisting, etc. However, The action never amounts to more than some spankings. The two supposedly fall in love, however, there is absolutely no back-story or plot that builds this love. The dialog in this movie is also some of the worst that I've ever heard. It should have been titled 50 Thousand Questions. It seems half of the dialog in the movie is questions. There were scenes where I literally counted five questions in a row. Out of all these questions, none were answered. I hung around to the end, thinking that there might be some twist or revelation about Mr. Grey that would pay off. That was a mistake. Even the ending is one of the worst I've ever scene. He whips her 6 times. She says ""don't ever touch me again"" and the movie ends as she leaves and the elevator closes. All those questions (literally questions in the dialog), and none are answered except for a few that are answered vaguely. Again, the script and dialog were terrible.

If someone was to have a relationship like this in real life, they would be bored with it quickly. We did get brief scenes of Ana's naked breasts and rear, Christian's chest and a little of his bare butt. I assumed that because women found this book series so ""amazing"", it meant they would get some beefcake. I think I will just wait for someone to make a gay parody of this to get more enjoyment.

Christian claims he doesn't do romance and that ""my tastes are singular"" and then as we go along we see him changing, becoming romantic, but still abiding by his rules that do change from time to time.

"filmfanperspective","1","1","4","5 May 2015"," Pathetic, cheap way to fleece soccer moms (*)
","The high point (or low, depending on how you see it) of my evening with Fifty Shades of Grey came when I slammed my fingers in a car door following the show. My shooting pain was coupled with a dose of adrenaline, followed by a not-so-subtle 'tingling' sensation. What a serendipitous event, for it was a stark contrast to what I just saw. The infamous novel-turned-film left me about as bewildered as one could possibly be after exiting a theater, but one thing was stark in its' clarity- when an injured middle finger creates more excitement than a film about sexual dominance and submissiveness, you're doing something wrong. Should not the 'global phenomenon' that is the novel be considered at least a little transcendent to be such a 'phenomenon'? Should not the stars of said 'phenomenon' be likable, or at least grab our attention? Should a film adaptation of a novel linked with female sexual empowerment at least dabble in empowerment?<br/><br/>I'm clearly no expert on female sexuality, but if this film is it, the proverbial straw that stirs the drink, then I'm even more perplexed than I already was. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson, while possessing a clear understanding of how the film should look, has created a very poor final product that only toys with the idea of sexual intimacy. Taylor-Johnson isn't bold enough to show us more than brief glimpses of (to be honest) relatively tame sexual encounters between two of the ""dumbest smart"" characters in recent memory. One of the stars (Johnson) does what she can to bring the frumpy, precocious Anastasia Steele to life, in spite of how the character is written, and the other- Christian Grey- has the charisma and charm of a sloth (Dornan). Wait, I've seen some mighty enigmatic sloths. Correction- he has the charisma of a celery stalk. What does it say for their casting choice when I found myself pining for another wealthy yuppie with perverse tastes (American Psycho's Patrick Bateman)? I blame myself for getting caught up in the hype machine, but alas, Fifty Shades is simply a confusing, dreadful film.<br/><br/>Christian Grey is a self-made billionaire, dabbling in something vaguely resembling publishing or business. By chance, Anastasia Steele (these aren't REALLY their names, are they?) gets to interview him, and she's so very intimidated that within five minutes, she's asking pointed questions. Christian begins to contact her/stalk her until she relents/agrees, and their odd dalliance begins. Why would I say odd? It is clear that she is attracted to him, but he intimidates her. She seems to enjoy what he's doing, then she's turned off by it. She seems to understand the figurative pool she's wading in, then seems shocked when it's water. It's clear that he wants her, but despite his multitude of sexual conquests, and a 'strict adherence' to the rules, he breaks them. Dornan's dull performance would have been far more palatable if his character stuck to what he said or stayed consistent throughout the film. Are his various 'shades' a purposeful choice? Perhaps, but more than anything, I just want these characters to pick a lane.<br/><br/>Most importantly, I wonder how can this be the 'it' thing for the sexual zeitgeist and not be very sexy- in fact, paling in comparison to the occasional late night Showtime and Cinemax serial. E.L. James may have written the erotic coming-of-age tale of our time, but if this is a literal translation, I'm immensely disappointed. How can this not bother to be all that daring? What boundaries are actually stretched in Anastasia and Christian's romps? I felt going in that I might be torn from my comfort zone, which I welcomed. I wanted to be a part of a reasonable, progressive discussion about stretching the acceptable limits of sexuality, needs, wants, and desires. Instead, I've never felt such a letdown from such a supposed controversy. This film isn't interested in that discussion, at least not without inventing something that truly isn't there on-screen.<br/><br/>What an enormous missed opportunity this film is. As Fifty Shades of Grey the novel captured the attention of so many, the film could have been something, perhaps the defining film about sexuality in our time. Instead of the immature giggling surrounding this film and novel, we could have moved forward, truly examining ourselves and asking the real questions about what we're attracted to, and what we desire. Maybe the novel has something further to say about the draw for either character to need BDSM in their lives, something that enriches the reasons for it being a huge part of the story. Maybe Anastasia has an inner dialogue in the book that fills in the gaps that the film offers. The fact that the film was released on Valentine's Day weekend is a perfect parallel to the consumer-driven farce that is the holiday.<br/><br/>Call it false advertising, call it hype, call it my heightened expectations, but I desperately wanted to see the film that social media told me I would see. The film fails in its' inability to present the audience with an honest discussion piece about the merits of its' subject or introduce any new material regarding the current state of sexual politics. It doesn't want to be NC-17, so it cheats by holding back and not presenting the sex in a more visceral, honest way. If, in fact, this is the tale that jolted the loins of millions- this vapid, tame, cowardly tale, then I can only blame the bedroom partners of those millions for not being their own inspiration. Lovers of the world- be attentive to your partner. Learn what pleases them. Open your minds. Whatever it takes, I beg you to please your partners so the populace won't feel the need to celebrate this wooden coward of a film."

IF you had read the books you would know that that IS what is written in the books. That is also the case in the 2nd book AND the 3rd book! So pleeeeaaaassse don't give it a bad grade on storyline when clearly it follows the book as it should.. <br/><br/>Alright - having said this I will tell my review if the movie. It's crap.. The books are a lot better. I have read all three of them. But I gotta agree with most of the other reviewers on here - the acting is very poor - no chemistry and very poor dialogue. They completely ruined my picture of how Christian Grey is in the books. It was bad casting actors. They should have chosen other more experienced actors (if such were auditioning)<br/><br/>1/10 for the very bad acting. 3/10 for the casting. I am sorry - but I just REALLY cant see this Jamie as Christian Grey.. Dakota is fine - she just needs some more acting lessons.. 7/10 for storyline.

","If this happens to be anywhere near the top, or anyone happens to see this, you can look no further. I'll tell you what every other review I've read (I went through 8 whole pages) will say: Do not waste your time. Everything about this movie is terrible, except for the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Terrible acting.<br/><br/>Terrible scripting.<br/><br/>Terrible directing.<br/><br/>Terrible perspective.<br/><br/>This is not romance. This is not a story about two way-ward souls finding solace with each other. It's a classic case of codependency at it's worst, and glorifies an abusive relationship at best.<br/><br/>What anyone who gave this review over 1 star will say: Those people who rated 1/10 are haters and have no idea what good cinema is.<br/><br/>Those people, the 7+/10 stars people, are fangirls (or fanboys, but I have seen few of these) or have a warped sense of reality.<br/><br/>Do not listen to these people. Run in the opposite direction as fast as you possibly can.<br/><br/>My recommendation? Try Kingsman: The Secret Service. Truly a wonderful film with a unique and intriguing story and thoughtful actors."

","Well, the Movie deserves 3 Stars, because the Set and the filming wasn't that bad. Although the story and the acting was poor, as expected. But i can imagine, that reading the book would be a much better experience, because of the tension you create in your mind while reading it. So some movies should not be filmed, like this one, so the book can keep it's mystery. There is actually nothing more to say, even tough IMDb wants me to write more, to fill the minimum of 10 lines because its written in there guidelines.

","I just want to say that 'Dakota Johnson' and 'Jamie Dornan' are great actors. But this script was not for them. It's as bad as the book and I haven't read the book. The book reviews on Goodreads were enough to put me off this book, and not to be mean, but the author and the writer for this film and book are just terrible at this art. The script made the actors come off as stupid, awkward and just weird. I was cringing non- stop from beginning to end because of the delivery of the lines. And you could see that the actors tried their best to act with whatever they were given. <br/><br/>I did like the last 3mins of the ending though. Not because it was finally over, but because it was nice to see Anna finally come to her senses. BTW... I think they should have picked someone else to be Christian. Jamie is good-looking and all but he doesn't look like the Christian I imagined. Jamie was too soft edged with his looks. But he's still really ridiculously good-looking. as for Anna... I don't really care who plays her. <br/><br/>All in all, terribly written book and as a movie adaption, the script did not work for ANYONE and EVERYONE involved."

There is not one thing sexy or even remotely attractive of Christian Grey. Anastasia Steele or Ana has zero sex appeal. Everything about this movie was abhorrent. Anyone who rates this movie a 10 are either getting payed to do so or have horrible taste in good movies/books.

James book,the screenplay by Kelly Marcel remarkably keeps the film strongly connected to its erotica roots,thanks to Marcel making the sex scenes ones which don't stray into hollow porn territory ,but are actually a physical expression for the passion that Steele & Grey have for each other.Showing Grey to be a dominant,controlling force in the sex scenes,Marcel delicately releases Steele's psychological domination on Grey,as every hand of Steele's which Grey ties to the bed,leads to Grey (unintentionally) allowing Steele to step further into his personal space.<br/><br/>Backed by a silky-smooth soundtrack,director Sam Taylor-Johnson & cinematographer Seamus McGarvey splash the soulless decay of Greys business world across the screen,by leaving any primary colours behind to instead paint everything in pristine, bleached out black & whites.Focusing on the characters faces during the sex scenes,Taylor-Johnson slowly transforms the faded colours into burning reds and melancholy blues,as the wild,burning passion that Grey shows towards Steele in his BDSM lifestyle starts to spill over his life with a burning hot red intensity,whilst deep blues superbly show Steele's sadness over not being able to have her flowing love for Grey get fulfilled by him.<br/><br/>Entering the movie in a sharp suit,Jamie Dornan gives a fidgety performance as Grey,with Dornan chipping at Greys brash,dominant smile,which fades away as Steele becomes the dominating force in the emotional side of their relationship.Put up against Grey,the very pretty Dakota Johnson (who also appears naked in the movie) gives a marvellous performance that strikes Steele with a fine innocence rather than a sickly-sweet naivet√©,thanks to Johnson balancing Steele's struggle to disconnect herself from the sex,with having a firm grip on being the most emotionally powerful of the two in a movie which is scatted with 50 shades of dazzling grey."

","This movie was simply awful. It's so awful that I now can't decide which I hate more, the book or the movie. Although the movie brought the book's characters to life, they were characters that were already hollow and distasteful, so actually seeing them on screen was an even bigger turn-off than reading about them in the books. On top of that, there was no chemistry between the two leads. I guess Jamie Dornan did a marginally better job than his female counterpart (Dakota Johnson) but being a decent actor in a crappy movie isn't really something to be proud of. Dakota Johnson, on the other hand, seemed to choose to portray her character from 2 alternating angles -- one minute she's obtuse, then another minute indifferent (almost bored, even). It's no wonder Christian Grey preferred spanking her, if only to evoke some sort of spirited or passionate reaction. If I were to ever know a person like Anastasia Steele (as she was portrayed by Dakota Johnson) in real life, I'd be inclined to think she was a little slow. <br/><br/>My overall impression of the movie was that it tried too hard to be some form of classy softcore porno with unending sexual suggestions callously injected into almost every scene and dialogue. How does one try so hard yet fail so miserably? The movie trudged along too slowly then went around in circles without actually going anywhere. <br/><br/>What were they thinking?!"

"sweetboyy_99","2","1","4","17 March 2015"," Boring. Just as I thought.
","The only real reason I ever considered watching this movie was solely because everyone was talking about this movie. I could not see why, as I too have been plagued with the pain of reading the so called book. I could just leave you here with these words, plenty to warn you about this film, but since IMDb has a restriction of minimum 10 lines, I have to go on about this pitiful excuse for a movie. So here I go. Sigh.<br/><br/>Started out as a Twilight fan fic. I noticed that, throughout the whole book, not because of the characters, even though Grey is obviously Edward. (yep. just throwing that out there.) It was both poorly written and (yes, I am saying this) WORSE than Twilight. I know. Nothing can be worse than Twilight, right? That's what I thought too. But this pitiful excuse for a book AND movie really lowers the bar for Hollywood films.<br/><br/>Then again, I never understood why someone would even want to take the time and effort into making the very hard to adapt book to the movie theaters, because the writing is awful and painful to read. I could only imagine how painful it would be to watch this. Honestly I think the writers just gave up on the movie and let it be. There's no chemistry (then again, why should there be?) between the characters, there's absolutely ZERO rememberable plot points or scenes, there's no interest in it whatsoever. Then again, the book stands for what many feminists hate. How can you justify such a psychopathic character like Christian Grey? Oh, he was raped as a kid. Wow. That makes SUCH a difference. Then it's okay--- Am I the only one to think the logic is flawed? ugh.<br/><br/>A lot of people have responded to my views on this film that ""You're a guy. It's not made for you."" BULLCRAP. I watch a lot of chick flicks, and admittedly, cried to a lot of them. I'm not afraid of watching chick flicks and I proudly admit that I do enjoy a lot of them. But a movie like this is NOT acceptable. I don't even want to call this a movie. It's a freaking soft-core porn video with BDSM theme. The sex scenes are just awkward. They're not even a little bit arousing. They're not giving in anything to the plot and the chemistry is just... well, there is NONE.<br/><br/>The actors do a horrible job. Especially the guy playing Christian Grey. I mean, at least convince us you're an intimidating guy... well, okay, he kind of had a creepy look in his eyes. But that's about it. Then again, I don't blame the actors, there's really not much to work with the source material and all.<br/><br/>The only reason this one got a 2 star rating was the musical score, the film features a lot of good music and that is the only thing I really liked about the adaption. And also, I would like to give the director some praise for trying to adapt such a horrible book. Surely it must have taken hard work to do. Now I have to live with the fact that two other movies will be released. I will not be watching them. I already read the other books and I hate myself everyday for that. Beware of this piece of crap. <br/><br/>2/10 avoid at all costs unless you're brain dead."

I admit it was a very well shot and lit film but the acting was very unconvincing and unrealistic. I wanted to care about Anna throughout this film but I honestly could not give two s***s. All I can say is I found it unbelievable on how this woman got so rich and famous for pulling off a more explicate and lame bondage type twilight fan fiction that is so poorly written and directed.

","The movie reflects the awfulness of the book. My wife wanted to watch it, so I relented, and downloaded the movie from the net. There was no way in Hades I'd pay to watch this peace of manure in the movie theatre. <br/><br/>So we settled in for an evening of soft porn watching, and what we got was a completely boring, uneventful peace of garbage, and two hours we could have been doing anything more interesting. Like watching the paint dry, or how the grass is growing. <br/><br/>There were some so called ""hot sexual scenes"", which were taken right out of a very soft porn movie. Bland, and very boring script, and very bad acting. <br/><br/>There was no chemistry between the actors, and the whole situation is completely unrealistic. The author of the book clearly shows her fantasies in her ""book"". She always wanted to be an ""innocent virgin"" and to be controlled in order to feel ""attractive and feminine"". Glorifying a socio-path, and an abusive relationship. She needs to see a psychiatrist, and not write a pamphlet that glorifies abuse. <br/><br/>The really disturbing thing however is, how many females liked the book, and the movie. It shows the female mentality, and the lack of intellect and good taste. Some read the book for the fun of it, just to see what it is all about, that is OK I'd say. However, the ones that take it as serious literary master-peace that is pushing the boundaries, do not know what in the hell they are talking about. <br/><br/>The fact of the matter is, that the actors destroyed their careers with this movie. I do hope, they will find jobs after this gross misjudgement on their part, when they took the roles in this thing called ""motion picture""."

","Let's be honest people, we were all going into Fifty Shades of Grey ready to hate it. Hell, I was damn near excited to go in there and tear it apart and laugh my ass off at how bad it would be. And surprisingly, I was wrong, kinda?<br/><br/>Imagine a world in which this movie was fully original, not based off of a book, not based off a book based off Twilight. I think we could all probably agree that the average rating would be much higher on here. Yes, this movie is pretty damn bad. But, if you pay close enough attention, it is almost self aware. You can almost get the sense that it is saying ""yes, I know everyone is going to hate me. So lets have a ball making this movie."" You can tell in the performance by Dakota Johnson that she certainly had this mindset, as did the line delivery called for by the screenplay. <br/><br/>However, the problem with the movie's self awareness is that while in it's delivery it says a big F you to the audience, it doesn't stretch far enough to make it what we all actually wanted from the movie, and that is the kinkiness. Stop lying to yourself, you know exactly why you saw Fifty Shades of Grey. You wanted to know if the BDSM scenes were as hot and steamy as everyone talked them up to be, and if you are like me, you can agree in saying that you were disappointed by how unsexy the sex scenes were. If this was not Fifty Shades of Grey, I don't think the un-sexiness would exactly be an issue, but as I said, you are seeing this movie for a reason, and it is not all that exciting.<br/><br/>I mean it, this movie really is not exciting, at all. Literally nothing happens. The entire time as we watch Ana decide if she will sign the contract, Christian does the exact opposite of what he says he is going to do as her dominant and takes her on a ton of cute dates and spoons her at night. So basically, the movie's logic does not make any sense. However, I cannot say I was surprised at all by how empty the mid to long 130 minute run time was since it was based off of Twilight. It is extremely obvious how directly inspired by the saga the author was, and it actually gets fun watching how related it is (50 Shades Drinking Game: Take a shot anytime there is a resemblance to Twilight. I promise you will be passed out by the end of the night!). So many parallels can be drawn that the boring screenplay becomes predictable because the characters and the actions they take are essentially the same.<br/><br/>But I have to say the single thing I was most surprised by from this movie is how well it is shot and directed. There is not a single scene that stands out as being anything less than great actually. It has a clean, dark, crisp, sexy look to it. However, the screenplay is not enough to match its greatness and all add up to be a successful movie.<br/><br/>Throughout this review, I talked as though I liked this movie, and believe me that is not the case whatsoever. I am in no way saying that this movie is good. All I am saying is that it needs to be looked at two ways, once as attached to the idea of 50 Shades of Grey, which will turn out to be actually not that bad, but disappointingly unkinky because of its reputation. The other is as a stand alone movie, and in that case it is seen as boring as hell. Self-aware or not, the movie should have chosen one of these goals to go for, and made it better. To hoping that the next film is more entertaining (be it even more self aware and funny, or actually significantly better in merit) I give Fifty Shades of Grey a 73/C."

The relationship between all the characters falls flat in the movie and jumps scene to scene because it is missing the necessary details. I really wanted to like this. Its so disappointing.

","Fifty Shades Of Grey is a strange movie to even exist. It's based on the erotic novel of the same name by E.L James, which itself is a slight tweak on her online fan-fiction 'Master Of The Universe', which in itself is based on the characters from Stephanie Myers Twilight. So basically we have gotten to the point where one horny woman's fantasy about two horribly written characters is able to become a big budget movie ...dear god, what have we done.<br/><br/>Positives first of all. Cinematography is glorious and beautiful to behold, from warm oranges and reds to cold blues and blacks, Seamus McGarvey has given life to what could have been a visually unexciting film. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson clearly knows what she wants and is not held back by the material, choosing to shoot creatively and get the most of what she has, the combination of Taylor Johnson and McGarvey has given us technically well made film. A film that is enhance by it's score and soundtrack. Ellie Gouldings uplifting 'Love Me Like You Do' and Beyonce's remix of her now classic 'Crazy In Love' add to their scenes with a large sweeping scale and a rousing intensity respectively. Danny Elfman's score may just be my favorite part of the film. stripped back and elegant, it makes for a great listen outside of the film (I recommend the track Ana and Christian)<br/><br/>That may seem like a lot of positives, and it would be, but the film fails so badly in every other area that it's hard to consider the above positives - whats the use in great cinematography when the stars that fill your frame are as lifeless as wooden planks? Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan have zero chemistry, I don't put this down to the actors though, lines such as 'fifty shades of f@#ked up' cannot be said by anybody naturally, I blame it on the source material. When I said Taylor Johnson didn't allow the source material to hold back her direction, I wasn't lying, but it seems everyone else did. The script, while I've heard is actually an improvement on its print counterpart' is full of plot holes, missing character motivations, basic development even ...and this is meant to be a faithful adaption so if nothing else I blame E.L James for being an inept writer. <br/><br/>This is a case where I feel getting as far away from the source material would have benefited the film greatly, I don't think the books fans would even mind if the film had a better script because lets face it, a 2 hour long fan-fiction is not something anyone wants, Fifty Shades Of Grey should have been one of two things: an erotic fantasy that fully embraces its stupidity, or a self aware, subtle satire of the book.

Unfortunately, the things that I enjoyed about the book, such as the development of the plot, were non-existent in the movie. Had I not read the books then I would have had no idea what was going on in the movie because the story was poorly told. Of the 4 or 5 sex scenes, I only enjoyed 2 of them. It's important that I point this out because the movie was centered around the sex. Honestly, the books were also centered around the sex but there were other layers that kept me interested. When I read the book I skipped through most of the sex because it was boring and redundant, and the same can be said for the movie. This was one of the most boring movies that I have seen in a long time. I knew that it was bad when couples started walking out of the theatre.

I'm so disappointed, I was looking forward to this movie thinking it was going to be like the books, but alas it's trash.<br/><br/>Also just wanted to say to those calling this domestic violence, it's an agreement between the two of them and she had the opportunity to walk away at any moment.

Not for the faint of heart or children, but not overly shocking. 50 Shades is not anymore shocking what one can see on H B O. With cable and internet smut standard are pushed to the point where the public has been desensitized. Directed and acted well. The viewer is interested in the characters and the character development. Shades digress into the sexually charged scenes and diverts into desegregation, which results into relationship conflict. The romantic themes of mystery, forbidden love, girl get boy and boy losses girl copy's the standards of the movie love story genre. Can the relationship be saved? Is Mr Grey redeemable? Questions which drive the movies story line. A love story with swanky fluff. Seven out of ten in the cheap thrills department. Many at the theater enjoyed the film."

","Film was all about sex, sex, sex! Despite the fact of the movie having some eye candy still, it was really no great writing or anything in it other than you guessed it.<br/><br/>Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith's daughter Dakota Johnson plays 21-year old Anastasia Steele as she is naive and very shy. As he is not suppose to interview the charming, handsome, but controlling and manipulative Christian Grey, hence the title a 27-year old billionaire. Who owns about everything it seems in WA State.<br/><br/>As her roommate and best friend is sick, Ana as she is called for short interviews him and is very fond of him. Despite the way he is and he is drawn to her. <br/><br/>As they begin rough sex and also a contract on the terms of Christian hence his controlling and overbearing ways. Despite being drawn to each other, both may not be the kind of people that they are meant to be. <br/><br/>It is a rough movie. Really save your money over this."

","When I start watching the movie, the first thing what came up in my mind was, I should look if I can get the soundtrack on iTunes. All over all, boring movie! Honestly, an English student, who look like to old to be a student?! Sounds irritating, sweet voice, like a fluffer. Looking all time to Mr. Grey like a shy puppy and be Virgin!? I can't get that, makes no sense! When Mr. Grey shows up his ""playroom"" it looks like a ""toy store"" , and the Virgin student Ana even look shocked or surprised! Well after some, boring, naked breasts, and more boring non existing story, but with good sound and 2 hours later, I was glad, that it was over. Resume of Fifty Shades of Greyi is: sound is great and sex sells. Who ever run to watch that movie, hopefully get not disappointed It's your decision if you still want to watch it."
"Stwworldtraveler","3","1","4","10 March 2015"," Jax! Where are you?!?!
","I finally saw the movie. I won't do a detailed autopsy (as there are so many) but James Dorian was not right for the part of Christian Grey. Granted it was never going to be an Oscar winning movie but it could have at least been more tolerable. Dakota wasn't great either but Anna is supposed to be awkward so it worked. I think with a stronger male lead, say Jax from sons of anarchy the chemistry would've been more explosive. (The casting was just kinda weird since you can't really have a sexual movie with two people who look bored.) All in all I gave it a 3 Bc at least couples can have a conversation about soft core S&M now that it's been 'mainstreamed'.<br/><br/>Also I didn't see any female abuse or degradation. I saw a young adult woman exploring (the full range and limits) of her sexuality thoughtfully and consciously. I find that some people have the Madonna/whore complex where a woman can either be a sainted mother on a pedestal or a 'whore' whom is asking for it. Many men and women seem surprised by fully integrated female sexuality where a 'good girl'/woman of principles can experiment with sexual acts deemed forbidden/dark/bad by insert patriarchal/religious group who also does said act in private-lol. Perhaps that's why English society had wives for heirs and mistresses for everything else and why some people still have people they marry and other people for a bit of fun. I'd rather marry someone I can have fun with... but that's just me:-P"
"Hellmant","2","1","4","6 March 2015"," I think this movie is trash, very poorly made trash at that!
","'FIFTY SHADES OF GREY': One Star (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The blockbuster film adaptation of the best-selling book, of the same name, about a 21-year-old virgin college student, who engages in an increasingly disturbing relationship with a sadomasochist industrialist. It was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and written by Kelly Marcel. The novel was written by E.L. James and was first published as 'Twilight' fan fiction, on different fan websites. The movie stars young newcomers Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, as it's two leads. Both the book and it's film adaptation have been heavily criticized for promoting sexual abuse and violence against women (by The National Center on Sexual Exploitation and various other people and groups); although the movie is supposedly extremely toned down from the novel it's adapted from (including the elimination of a scene of questionable rape). I found the film to be very disturbing, as well as laughably bad and pretty poorly made. Critics, and a majority of viewers, have mostly found the film adaptation to be better made than the book though (even though it maintains an average rating of 4.2, out of 10, on both the rottentomatoes and IMDb websites).<br/><br/>Johnson stars as Anastasia Steele; a 21-year-old undergraduate at Washington State University. When her roommate, Kate (Eloise Mumford), becomes sick and is unable to interview a rich Seattle businessman, named Christian Grey (Dornan), for the college paper, she asks Anastasia to fill in for her. When she meets Christian, Anastasia is clumsy, awkward and very shy. He's immediately drawn to her for these reasons. Grey then proceeds to stalk her; at the hardware store where she works and then at a bar, she calls him drunk from. He takes her home to his place, when she passes out wasted. Despite all the entrepreneur's illegal, and extremely creepy, behavior towards her, Anastasia also finds herself drawn to him and the two begin a sexual relationship. Christian explains that he's a dominant and he wants Anastasia to be his submissive. When she's initially repelled by the idea, he continues to harass her into signing a legal contract; to become his sex slave. <br/><br/>First of all the movie is really poorly written and badly acted; but I've heard the book is even worse. It's also shockingly dull and feels drastically unemotional, and very dry, for most of it's 2 hour running length. I found parts of it amusing, and I do like the way it ends, but mostly I found this film to be a complete waste of time; for anyone looking for quality entertainment at all. I also agree with the criticisms that it does promote abusive relationships and violence against women. The central relationship depicted in the movie is definitely not a healthy one, in the slightest, and the Christian Grey character is very much an abusive sexual predator. The fact that the film pretends to be some kind of a romance, as well, is really insulting (to everyone). I've always been attracted to domineering women (mostly as fantasy) but not in any way similar to this. I think this movie is trash, very poorly made trash at that.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbh5F6Mfw"

","If this was a review about the book it would be 10 out of 10 easy. I loved the books. There was a very true and different love story then ""fall in love, get married, have babies, life is perfect"" like most books are now days, or drinking blood for an afternoon snack, that was getting kind of old. The movie fallowed the book very well. As far as character descriptions and lines went, it did very good. I did feel like through the whole movie it rushed through every main part of when they really started to fall in love, or any part where they weren't having sex anyway. It ended up feeling more like I was watching a very long porno than an actual movie. Sense it skipped a lot of the parts where they did fall in love it kind of ended up being a movie about a rich baby faced guy stalking a college student in the hardware store and then the next day beating here with a belt. The whole movie felt rather rushed but it also dragged on cause by half way through you are already irritated by the poor acting and you really want to turn it off but you also want to finish it because you still have a little bit of hope left that it will get some what better and maybe you can find the chemistry between the two actors instead of it looking like two brick walls trying to talk to each other."

"morganparker2","2","1","4","8 March 2015"," I never read it, its not great
","I think the actors are good and the camera work was good. I don't think this is so much a bondage book/film as a person who is damaged and can't live another way, then someone loves them and tries to understand and live with them and ultimately fails. The only interesting thing about the film for me was the guys history and how it affected him today. Of course they don't really get into that and cut it off at the end with her leaving. I was hoping she would get through to him so he could be on the road to a normal relationship because he felt a connection to her. I thought that was the predictable ending, but it didn't, so I guess props for going with the unusual ending. I felt like it was a lesson in some people are pretty far from being able to have a normal relationship."
"anniebandura","2","1","4","8 March 2015"," Fifty Shades of Why!
","This one goes out to all the negative whiners out there who saw the film - marketing on Fifty Shades was brilliant and that's why Hollywood is laughing all the way to the bank at its $85 mill opener. Yes, at your expense! It has made it's $40 mill back and then some. <br/><br/>It's a thin line between love and hate or whether fans/non fans consent to Fifty Shades. This is the perfect film that everyone wants to beat up. Let's talk about it at the water cooler at work or give up our two cents worth of analogies on the Net, Facebook, Twitter or wherever. Hollywood executives dream.<br/><br/>I can see them all around the boardroom table feverishly pitching this film.<br/><br/>""So we got this Fifty Shades film- ""<br/><br/>""How many copies did the books sell?""<br/><br/>""Hundred million or so, but...""<br/><br/>""We'll release it Valentine's Day!""<br/><br/>""The thing is it's not exactly a romance...more along the lines of S&M...""<br/><br/>""What did I tell you about romance...now get me the crop!""<br/><br/>For those of you that didn't favour the books, yet still went to see this film with eyes wide open...too bad, so sad you got duped out of your pocket money. Nobody forced or subjected you to go see it -there's the door, use it, and don't let it hit your butt on the way out!<br/><br/>Reviewers have been rather sadistic about the movie, saying it doesn't accurately represent kink or the occasional detour into S&M. Or dating. Or journalism. Or billionaires. Or chemistry. Or romance. Or love. Or the way human beings speak. In other words, it's just like every other Hollywood film. <br/><br/>As for the sex part - it doesn't happen until 40 minutes into the movie (shout out goes to the gal that actually timed the first sex scene) and there is 11 minutes in total. Somehow, I can't get the image out of my head of a woman feverishly sitting in a theatre with a stop watch! <br/><br/>As for the domestic violence part, I've viewed way more abuse in a litany of other films and on TV. I could give you a list, but frankly I couldn't be bothered too much work. Which makes me ponder if Ghomeshi's damage control team are paying attention, taking notes on what constitutes consensual sex. Having said that...I didn't see the rape connotations reviewers are attributing to this film, but I did witness a girl willing to experiment and test her own boundaries. It was a power struggle between two people about having control. Christian wanted to control all aspects of Anastasia's life. She was not willing to relinquish total control over to him and in that way she was holding all the cards, which made her powerful. Yes, you can walk a fine line right into abuse, but she had the option to leave at anytime or say ""No!"" She wanted to know what made him tick and didn't bank on the consequences of finding out.<br/><br/>My personal take on this film is irrelevant, but here goes - it was slow, dull-witted, void of any cohesive storyline. It was not meant to be a romance as mentioned above. Maybe if the leads delivered their lines better, shared some mutual real passion or chemistry, were actually believable - the public wouldn't be so enraged at Fifty Shades of Box Office Bliss!<br/><br/>But...I did want to address some of the comments on here about Johnson not wanting to have fans see her movie. She made a generic statement that was taken out of context. She was referencing her parents and how she didn't want them to see her in a sex flick, kind of like how you wouldn't want to view your parents doing it. Johnson was proud of doing Fifty Shades and knew what she signed up for and she did so willingly. She studied for the part by reading and researching BDSM. Dornan went to dungeons and actually watched dominant/submissive sessions to better prepare him for his role. They hired a BDSM to give advice on set, so it would be as realistic as possible. These are quotes taken from Johnson herself - ""I'm proud of the movie. I think she's actually stronger than he is. Everything she does is her choice. And if I can be an advocate for women to do what they want with their bodies and not be ashamed of what they want, then I'm all for that."""

I felt no chemistry between the actors. It was like they were counting their moves like dance instructors count steps. The way the characters acted was annoying. It should have been a TV movie or straight to DVD. I probably would of had some excitement towards the movie if they cast differently. I did not find either of the actors attractive.

JAMIE has better films to watch, but either way this does take a impact on his career. He will make money off of this mainly because the women that enjoyed the book. Take the time to understand this is mainly about sex, and a splash of weird romance. The movie might give you the chills especially because of the music. The movie is the best when it is showing a nude or passionate sex scene, i can honestly say besides those scenes there's a blandness to the movie that will make you wanna just say wheres the sex. But trust its full of it so just be ready for a lot of women giggling and the scent of wet cat."
"moviegirlpia","5","1","4","3 March 2015"," not bad, but...
","I read the books, they certainly aren't like the literary giants they speak of in the novels, but it's fun literature, and a decent story. The Fifty Shades trilogy isn't about BDSM, or a man taking control of or abusing a woman. It is about a man and a woman who fall in love and change one another's lives. It's about a woman who wants to explore her sexuality with an unusual man. It is a story, and just that. Its fantastical, ridiculous at times, and far fetched. But isn't that what the reader is looking for? To escape from reality? I feel the movie missed the heart of the books. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. As usual if you didn't read the books you will miss out on the entire point. It's the usual reason a book to film fails in the eyes of the readers. It's the most difficult thing to do because everyone's perceptions are different and it is impossible to bring to life what millions have different ideas and pictures of in their minds. If they go on to make the next two they can redeem themselves and improve upon the things they missed in the first film. I hope that they do.If you loved the books I suggest you go see it. If you want to see it for the hype, don't bother. If you want to know the story, read the books first."
"meeza","4","1","4","2 March 2015"," My viewing contract expired early in this one!
","Sorry, but I am going to whip, I mean rip this film apart with my review! Oh you poor servants who have been dominated by a novel to go see the film adaptation of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". Director Sam Taylor-Johnson constructs an uneven, unbridged, and unexciting film in ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". With all due apologies, Taylor-Johnson is the grey goose here. I think she should have spiced it up with an 80's soundtrack consisting of ""Back on the Chain Gang"", ""Whip It"", and of course ""Sex (I'm A....). As most of you know, this film is about a literary student named Anastasia Steele who meets a young billionaire named Christian Grey. Grey is soft spoken and sly, but he has a fetish for bondage, S&M, whipping, etc. Grey romances Anastasia and tries to persuade her to sign a ""dominant-submissive"" to-be-my-lover contract. It was about this time that I felt that the filmmakers of this garbage needed was a good spanking from their studio heads; even though that is far from happening since the movie has brought in chains of box office gold. Jamie Dornan plays Grey and Dakota Johnson is Steele; Dornan was dormant with his performance and Johnson did not provide any scene-steeling work in my book. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" was as shady as they come; and I mean that literally. * Failure"

"ulanism","3","1","4","1 March 2015"," 50 shades of hatred
","When i saw a review of this movie asking why they made a film out of what is thought as worst piece of writing i decided to write a respond here by giving my opinions about this movie. I watched this movie because there were hot discussions everywhere and they seemed to hate this movie so much. Too much for most of them haven't even watched the movies and the rest can't accept BDSM.<br/><br/>1. People should be aware that filmmakers make film for living. They need something that can sell. This worst piece of writing sells and the movie does too.<br/><br/>2. People should be aware that when they decide to watch this movie, they are not about to watch a regular romance movie. This movie is about BDSM, so if you can't enjoy it, don't take a sip.<br/><br/>Personally, this movie is not my cup of tea. I think the story is so much of a sensual version of chiclit full of clich√© ideals. But it doesn't make me hate the movie. I think there might me some who enjoy this ""different"" version of Cinderella story.<br/><br/>I was actually surprised that this movie can show some issues regarding relationship. About consent, trust, understanding, and expectation vs reality. Even though it is set in ""different"" kind of relationship, the issues are pretty much the same."

IT IS OFFICIALLY PART OF MY WORST MOVIES EVER LIST. They shouldn't be proud that they hit the box office. The author of the books must be very disappointed as well. There acting is very empty. It didn't even affect me. I can't believe they made such a waste of time and money film. This is not a $40 million budget movie! I suggest they find new actors for the next movie because they just won't do. I am crazy about the books but this is way far. I think they deleted more than half of the book. The lines are too different."
"SarahIOM","4","1","4","22 February 2015"," 50 Shades of Paul Spector
","Jamie Dornan is very pleasing on the eye, if not the ear, as his Northern Irish accent bubbled through most of his dialogue. I'm loathe to say anything bad as he is clearly a nice chap in real life but the fact of the matter was, he was weak as Christian. Dakota was OK as Ana but she seemed a little old, wiser than the Ana I had read and certainly more intelligent in vocabulary and wit. Their chemistry was OK but not steaming hot. Christian's family's airtime was mercifully short and completely miscast. Elliot is just not that hard looking and Rita Ora? Really? It was better written than the book - no inner goddess or ""Oh mys"" and I laughed a couple of times at things I knew weren't in the book. However, as is sadly often the case, my imagination and development of the characters in the book was really quite different to the way they were portrayed on the big screen. I didn't feel that Christian valued Ana as I had read, he didn't seem lost in wonderment at this beautiful creature or scared that she would bolt. He just seemed to want to get his end away! He was far more aggressive than I thought he should have been and I saw a 'rape-face' I had last seen on Jamie Dornan's visage playing the serial killer Paul Spector. From then on it was difficult to separate the two characters (beard or no beard). The scene where he follows Ana to Georgia as she's drinking Cosmopolitans with her mother was far too 'stalkery' and all I could think of was Patrick Bergin's character in Sleeping with the Enemy. Not a happy mix and certainly not the Christian Grey I imagined. Having said all that, I will buy the blu ray and I will watch it again, probably a lot more comfortably in my own home."
"Ihavesomethingtosay","4","1","4","18 February 2015"," OK here it goes.
","First of all for those who haven't watched the movie my review is not a spoiler. I just want to write down my view on all of this. I've read the books. When I finished the first book I was like: ,,Ok, I don't like that much but why not, lets read more''. And I've read all the parts, three of them. The books didn't left any impact on me. I just didn't cared, it wasn't good, it wasn't bad, it was just: ,,Ok, whatever''. So when they said that it's going to be a movie I was like: ,,This could be interesting''.I was wrong. I like the girl she kind off look like the girl I imagined in my head, but I would love if the actor was Gabriel Macht. I believe that the movie would be way more interesting."
"James_De_Bello","4","1","4","18 February 2015"," 4/10
","OK so lets give some disclaimers right away here. Firstly, all I knew about 50 Shades of Grey going in was that it involved BDSM. Nothing more. I knew about the hate that surrounds this property, but never understood why. I really went into this movie with an open mind, I wanted to see if it was really that bad and I really wanted to take something good out of it. Moreover I have no problem with its content. I really don't give a f**k about ""controversy"" and don't believe in ""taboo topics"", I am totally a supporter of freedom of expression and I would be OK with a movie that looked at anything really no matter how weird or out there, provided that it is doing something right. So having said that, understand that I did not hate this movie just to jump on the band wagon, I really wanted to come out with a fresh opinion and actually was forgiving with the film earlier on.<br/><br/>Is ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" a trainwreck? No. It has some interesting cinematography, the performances are good and the direction is somewhat smooth and keeps things fluent until the hour and forty five minute mark more or less. So as much as looking back I really can't help but dislike the incoherence of this movie I cannot give it a lower grade because I would be lying if I told you that I wasn't intrigued for a very good portion of it, knowing nothing going in, I wanted to understand what was the deal. By the way, very good soundtrack and score by Elfman.<br/><br/>But, that's really all of it. I have two big negatives that I think ruin and make this whole concept worthless. Firstly, it is nor nasty nor seducing enough, it is so safe! With the material involved I wanted a deep psychological exploration, I wanted to feel the weirdness, I wanted to be shocked and surprised and moreover I wanted to be seduced by the leads. The fault is not theirs though, they give performances that you couldn't really brag on because they're good; the fault is with the tone of the movie overall that made all of what it was build up for, fall flat. Second point: that fu**ing, idiotic, melodramatic, useless, dumb, anticlimactic, boring ending was impossible to bear. Other that giving absolutely no fu**ing resolution to the characters or an explanation to their motivations it is so inherently absorbed in itself it made it even worse. Those last 15 minutes made me really angry.<br/><br/>""Fifty Shades of Grey"" has some good moments and promises early on to be better than your expectations, but the more it goes on the more you will ask yourself what was all the fuss about. All in all it is just another bad movie."
"Seraphion","4","1","4","18 February 2015"," No real originality on the story
","After interviewing him for her campus newspaper, Anastasia Steele gets close to Christian Grey, her college's benefactor. Soon, Christian saves her from being abused while she's drunk. He then dazzles her with a fancy date. But as she surrenders herself to him, Christian instead reveals a bit about himself and shows Ana his play room, filled with BDSM equipments. He offers her a contract to be his 'submissive' while he becomes the 'dominant'. They have sex that night, but not in the play room as Ana says she will review the contract. <br/><br/>Ana and Christian discuss the contract in a business meeting, with her striking out items which don't fit her. For Ana's graduation Christian buys her a new car. He even takes Ana to see his parents. Ana goes to see her mother in Georgia the next day, and Christian flies there to see her. More and more Ana tries to convince Christian into a more normal relationship but he refuses again and again. He reveals bit by bit that he had a rough past which shaped him into his behaviors. But eventually Ana can't stand of Christian's obsessions anymore and decides to walk away.<br/><br/>Well that's just about the shortest synopsis I've ever written so far for my reviews here. Why, you may ask? It's because that For me the movie offers a very predictable set of story, all the way from the background to the development, to the final ending. Yes I haven't read the book, and what I watched was a rather incomplete copy of the movie that I have to watch it again when a better is available, but I'd say I agree to those negative comments about this movie.<br/><br/>In my eyes, the story and character backgrounds are a full copycat. People say that this is just a lame BDSM fan fiction of Twilight. Well I say that even Twilight is better than this movie for the romance angle. For me this movie feels like a slightly modified version of the famous Meteor Garden / Boys Before Flowers drama from back in the early 2000s. <br/><br/>The story is just that drama series, minus the other insignificant three guys, plus the BDSM, jam packed into a Hollywood 100-minute long movie script. All the elements are in perfectly; the wealthy yet dominant male lead, the innocent female lead, meeting the male's parents, and even the piano sit in uncut, even though many of those elements get tweaked to account for the focus shift to the added BDSM elements. With them in place, the movie lost the unpredictability aspect, which makes it quite boring from the early fifteen minutes or so.<br/><br/>The romance is just nothing special. There's no relationship build-up that takes some time. There are montages accompanied by the good soundtracks, then they suddenly move to the BDSM build-up. Having said that even Twilight is better than this movie, I find it very strange that the focus on the BDSM is kind of reluctant. There are too many cuts and edits into those scenes that they give out Dakota's body double away. There goes both the romance and BDSM angle.<br/><br/>The acting overall is just a decent one. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan played out their focus roles at just standard levels of performance, nothing bad but also nothing special. Although I should emphasize that while she kind of gets the innocent angle for Ana, Dakota Johnson didn't really get the sexy part for the submissive scenes. Jamie Dornan looks like he didn't realize that the movie's focus is about the two characters that he displays only the same expressions over and over.<br/><br/>My say for Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) is just a 5 out of 10 score. It's not quite an entertainment for me due to the story gets so predictable. A recommendation is just a so-so considering the high anticipation this movie gained. But seriously, wetting yourselves in the cinemas for this is just stupid."
"swtsm","10","2","14","10 May 2015"," Classic love story
","Well, how do you like me now. This movie has people in an uproar in more ways than imaginable. For some, they read to much between the lines, while others just enjoy the story that enfolds. With the world on edge, people are taken into a classic love story of boy meets girls with a twist. If people would just take out the sex/love making and see the picture for what it truly is.....LOVE STORY, than we will all be right with the world. This movie will make you laugh, cry, have you on the edge of your seat and than send you in a tailspin. While, I will agree that the book was more intense (as it should be), the movie was good and kept it ""within the lines"" without turning it into a movie that could have easily been banned if it did go by the book. Hence, this is why people tells us to read the books. Movies are not and should not be made verbatim of what is to be read first. As they say, a book is worth a thousand words. Please enjoy the three books and movies that go with. Did we not do this for Romeo and Juliet?"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","Null","1","5","22 February 2017"," Fifty Shades of Grey
","Anastasia Steele is a college student who substitutes for her roommate to interview famous billionaire, Christian Grey. From the minute they meet, they are attracted to each other and start an interesting relationship. Christian is a dominant who would like Anastasia to be his submissive. While she's open to ideas, she's curious as to why Christian is so obsessed with the contract he sets up for their relationship and why he wants to hurt her. Staring Dakota Johnson, Jamie Dornan, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson based on the world wide best seller by Twilight fan fiction author E.L. James, this controversial book and movie definitely crashed the internet with opinions on wither this was just a silly story or actually harmful to society.<br/><br/>The thing I actually do respect this movie with is that they do seem like they genuinely tried to make something at least decent. Dakota and Jamie do seem like they're doing their best with what they've been given. Dakota tries to give Anastasia some life and gives her a little bit of a human trait vs. from what I've heard her character is like in the book. Jamie falls shorter and takes Christian as someone who takes himself way too seriously. Because the story is bad, I think that's why I cut them some slack. How actors could say some of these lines with a straight face, I could only imagine the blooper reel. The film is actually put together very well. It's shot well, edited well and given a decent musical score. Sam Taylor-Johnson went with a smooth style, giving the film a modern sleek look. I particularly appreciated the negotiation scene in the office. It looked beautiful and the lines are actually darkly humorous giving the audience a chance to breathe.<br/><br/>The sad part is, it's just a bad story. Nothing is consistent, Christian goes back and forth saying he's not a ""flowers and candy kind of guy"" but will buy Anastasia a computer and a car. He says he does not get emotionally involved, but meets her family and takes her to meet his family. Anastasia is told from minute one that he's not looking for a relationship, but she is constantly trying to get love out of him. She asks him to show her the worst and when he does she gets angry with him but then will confess her love for him. This relationship makes as much sense as trying to read a bill for health care, it's confusing and exhausting trying to figure it out.<br/><br/>So, would I recommend this one? Honestly, I think people really over reacted to it. There have always been erotic movies, there have always been bad movies and there have been erotic bad movies. I personally enjoy this as an unintentional comedy and like to quote it. To me, I don't see how you couldn't find it as funny as The Room or Birdemic, it's just a little more sleek and trendy to hate on it. If you're not into ""so bad it's good"" this is definitely not the movie for you. I don't think this movie is harming society, it's just a fantasy story that women and some men would get into because of the idea of it. No one takes this as a guide to BDSM 101 or as to the idea of what a healthy relationship is. If they do, they need some serious help."

","Honestly I don't think that it was a bad movie. I read the book and it was similar. The good thing is that it was not so long-winded as the book. It was very tricky to make a film of such a sensitive book. I think that every woman had a different mister Grey in mind. With a book you can make your own world with the tools that a book give you. Now the film have decided how everything looks. For some it will be a disappointed and for some it will be a good translation. <br/><br/>This is finally a story that is not so predictable and standard as the most movies. It goes about the mind games, the poor past of Christian, and why he have become this way and of course the physical attraction between the characters. Well preformed if you ask me. The sexual scenes are just a small part of the whole movie. Their was a lot of fuss about this movie because of the success of the books. People had maybe too high expectations.<br/><br/>Welcome to 2015. Sex is no taboo."

","Okay, so I never read any of the books and I didn't see the movie in the theater at the time of release - I also did not read reviews at the time (!), so when I was perusing the On Demand movie list and came across Fifty Shades of Grey, I thought OK, let's see what this was all about. Before the movie started, I checked out the IMDb rating and could not believe it was a 4.2 (!) Seriously. I mean, this isn't Last Tango in Paris or The Thomas Crown Affair, but it's certainly NOT a 4.2. The acting is just fine - Jamie Dornan is incredibly handsome, very intelligent, very polished; Dakota Johnson is absolutely perfect as a shy, smart, if somewhat naive female ""object of attention"". This is a 7. Not a 4.2 And the soundtrack throughout is just WONDERFUL. Fifty Shades of Grey is definitely worth watching if only to satisfy one's curiosity as to what all the media frenzy was about, and I can only imagine that the 4.2 rating comes from those who read the books and were seeking a more faithful adaptation or whatever.... Since the director was basically fired from the series, the movie clearly did not meet expectations of the author/fans, but, again, this movie -- just standing alone as a movie for goodness sake (!) -- is a 7, not a 4.2."
"alecwest","3","1","5","9 May 2015"," Just doesn't cut the mustard.
","It's hard to write a review of this film that ""doesn't"" include spoilers. So, consider this entire review a spoiler. Also note that I've not read the trilogy of books.<br/><br/>At age 64, I've been around the block a few times and am certainly not a prude. But while the acting was good (the 3 stars), the premise of the film is one I found disturbing. Christian Grey is a deviate, pure and simple. And the idea that a virgin would first experience sex with a deviate just turned me off. The only good thing about this film occurred just before the credits rolled at the end - when Anastasia Steele had the good common sense to end the relationship.<br/><br/>I realize there are 2 sequels in the works - the first one (""Fifty Shades Darker"") comes out in 2017. The second one, ""Fifty Shades Freed,"" will likely come out in 2019. And I can tell you right now that I will NOT be seeing them. I honestly don't care if Grey is ever redeemed. Or worse, I worry that by the end of the 3rd film, Steele might be ""converted"" to the darker angels of her nature. And that would be a major bummer.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, I've not read the books. So, I have no idea how the trilogy ends. But keep in mind that Hollywood often ""tinkers"" with the story lines of novels on which movies are based. In other words, the ending of the 3rd film could be much different than the ending of the 3rd book. Forewarned is forearmed."

","First I'd like to start by saying that any ""actress"" with the least level of self-respect would have turned this role down. Bad acting by most of the cast (except for the driver, I liked him) makes this movie a straight forward pornographic movie, and even the sex is NOT that great. As for the plot, he offered her a contract where she will completely surrender herself to him, he would be her Dominant partner and has complete control over her. But, in reality she was controlling him the whole time, he was chasing her, texting, calling, following her wherever she was. REALISTICALLY, she was the dominant and he was submissive (very) to her will."

","I indeed tried to read the book but was appalled by the writing. So I decided to watch the movie instead. At least, I did not turn away and finished it. <br/><br/>It is an S&M version of Cinderella, the undying fairy tale of all time. I would think Ms. James used this classic plot well. She probably should have someone edit her writing to make it readable. <br/><br/>People are curious about S&M which is why this movie generates so much buzz. If the S&M part would have been removed, the whole essence would be gone. So taking or leaving it is up to you. If you have an open mind and not opinionated, you might enjoy the movie. It's not either well scripted or cinematographic but somehow worthy of the attentions. I have watched ""The Lover"" (1992) and ""A Frozen Flower"" (2008). They both had sexually explicit scenes which might be more intensively than this one. However, they had more than one dimension story lines which I thought was essential to keep audiences captive. <br/><br/>The sexually explicit scenes should serve as means to tell the story which cannot do without. Unfortunately, this one seemed to be short of that."

In fact, the movie will remind you early Twilight series which had immature actors and worst direction. Screenplay is weak with no sense of storyline. Cinematography is good. Art direction is nice.

",""" May contain spoilers"" OK let me just say that if you have read the book or even if you haven't and have only heard about it, everybody interprets the book in their own way. For me the book was about how one mans need for dominance grew to need and love Ana anyway possible. The book obviously could add in a lot more detail than the film could ever do however when you watch the film the story is hard to follow all those little details needed to be added in someway for example his need for dominance was never truly shown his need to control everything was weak his resistance to her was not defined enough and her need to understand him was there but not properly shown to annoy him the way its portrayed in the book. The sex scenes I'm not so fussed by it would of been better if they could of shown more of the dominant and submissive side because it was more like what every husband does too his wife at least once in their marriage not like what the book makes you feel he needs and wants but the story never showed his need to control every situation even in the bedroom. <br/><br/>The book made you need to understand him, made you need to help him, made you want to let him do what he wants to do to you but the film lacked the direction it needed to get there. The actors were good for what they were given a few of the scenes needed more grrr and the role of her friends needed more input to make you understand that its not normal their relationship to other people, The parents house scene was excellent in the book and needed a lot more for the film so that you can understand his needs.<br/><br/>i would say overall i will still watch any sequels that come out but it should not follow the rest books as i feel it will not be able to completely show the true nature of what the story shows for me."

","This was a mediocre film that is based on a mediocre book that seems to subvert reality for its lack of originality and substance. The movie or book for that matter is thoughtless drivel that was not lost to Hollywood producers who put the work on the big screen. It would not be worth going if you did not know the book which is a poor dissertation on sexual philandering. What a pretentious film. Not to mention the graphic nature of the movie that is not suitable for everyone and seems to flout the ideals of love and human affection. That said, the film seems to promote garish acting by two leading actors who seem to grapple with the meaning of the book as it plays out on a epic scale that is panoramic-yet, undermined by its sexual drubbing. This is a bad book and worse yet, should have never been the subject of a film that is so unsavory."

I didn't feel Christian's feelings grow for Ana, he was the same all the time. Ana's roll was well played, she was naive, funny, hurt, in love, but I expected more form Christian. He is hot, but he played dull and boring. He barely spoke and when he did all the lines were just copied from the book. And although Christian was wealthy as hell, I still didn't feel how rich he was. There have been movies before, where you get the sense how wealthy one can be, but this was just average. Also in the book he is more controlling and overprotective- I didn't see that either. And when it comes to sex scenes and BDSM, it left me cold. Although the movie lasted 2 hours it still felt like it was rushed form one scene to another. All the other cast was basically left out which is a shame. The film just didn't go deep enough for me.

In the book they do sex during 10 pages and other things in 1 page, in the movie they do sex in 1 minute and other things in 10. Of course, not the sex is relevant, but the feeling of watching the movie, the feeling of waiting the next episode, the next scene.<br/><br/>And one more thing, on the big screen I remarked that the white shirt of Mr Grey was not so well ironed, really??

","I was very excited to see this movie and I am glad I have seen it. However, I expected more because I truly enjoyed the books. I understand that in comparison to other novels such as Catcher in the Rye - the writing of the book does not meet their standards. However, the topic of BDSM, sex, love, general shock value, as well as the writers ability to grab superficial interests (even ones we admit we do not have) is amazing. <br/><br/>I expected more out of the last sex scene. It should have been far more climatic and longer because the sex scenes are obviously an important factor.<br/><br/>As well, I wish that most of the lines that Christian recited were taken seriously, creating a greater intensity. I know that the movie had many moments of comedic relief but in the books I did not see it that way. He seemed very awkward and lacked the emotion and confidence that I had envisioned. I wanted to see more dominance - like that of the scene in which he sneaks into Anna's apartment and takes her from behind - slapping her backside and spitting out a tip of the condom wrapper, as if ""That's right, this what I'm about, problem?"". Jamie is very clean cut, which is what Mr. Grey is, but Jamie's portrayal lacks the alpha male or rough edges necessary for this role. Take for instance, when Christian quoted, ""I don't make love. I f**k ... hard"". That should have made my knees weak sending me into circulatory shock ... but I thought, ""Well ... okay? ...""<br/><br/>Third of all, I wish the conversations had more intellect. Fourth of all, I feel there was not enough chemistry between the two which hindered the softer scenes and made it awkward (not the good kind of awkward) when he would frequently touch her face passionately. <br/><br/>I had an idea of how this movie would play out and it is similar to the bondage scenes in Nymphomatic Volume 2. (Definitely see that and compare!) I wish that perhaps Lena Dunham (creator of the television show Girls) would have contributed to the making of this movie because ... her tastes are very 'similar' ...<br/><br/>Overall, regardless of how tasteless viewers felt the production of movie was, the popularity was enough to generate wonderful sales. They probably do not give a care about the ratings because they are laughing all the way to the bank! $$$"

So, naturally, when the movie came out I was eager to see it on opening weekend.<br/><br/>First, I think the actors chosen for Anastasia Steele, and Christian Grey are spot-on for the roles. I wasn't sold at first, but after seeing the movie, it is very evident that they fit the roles they were chosen for. I would have like to see Jamie Dornan be more intense, but he didn't do a bad job.<br/><br/>With that being said, I feel that the director rushed the film, and because of that, the film felt very choppy. The movie came in at just over 2 hours, and there could have easily been another 20-30 minutes added so you can actually see how the characters develop their relationship.<br/><br/>There were several very key parts from the first book that weren't in the movie, which disappointed me.<br/><br/>For instance, when Christian leaves the hardware store in the book, he looks back at Ana and says, ""I'm glad Miss Kavanaugh couldn't do the interview."" This is such an important line from the book, and it's the first time you see that Christian likes her. This wasn't in the movie at all.<br/><br/>Additionally, Ana interviews for her internships and is offered a job at one of the publishing companies, which plays a huge part in the book series. There was no mention of this in the movie.<br/><br/>Her vacation to Georgia to see her mother could have been cut out completely from the movie. The book goes into far more detail, and this part of the movie is essentially pointless because so much has been taken out.<br/><br/>The movie ends the same way the book did, with Ana leaving Christian, which makes me look forward to the second movie - with hopes of better direction. Overall, very disappointed. I wanted to love this movie, but the directing and character development on screen is sorely lacking."

I found their relationship boring and unbelievable. In terms of the eagerly awaited sex scenes that were so built up beforehand.. they were awful and I wanted them to end. How was S & M made boring? Haha.<br/><br/>In terms of where the film was set... I would believe it if somebody were to tell me the film was set in three streets beside each other. I never once got the sense that they were travelling miles and miles across America? Whenever Mr. Grey went to Georgia and surprised Anna, there was absolutely no shock from her? I was baffled.<br/><br/>Anna was made out to be really thick/stupid I think.. and she was obsessed with Mr. Grey from the very first time she met him.. interviewing him. I don't think it was justified as to why she was so? Would it not have made more sense to have Anna grow more and more obsessed with him throughout the film? No? <br/><br/>Overall... brutal film, brutal acting and waste of my time! Won't be surprised if that's ruined Jamie Dornan's career. Money back?"
"ChristianDrey","4","1","5","15 February 2015"," Fifty Shades Messed-up
","I came into the movie house yesterday night with low hopes. Unfortunately, the movie did not disappoint. The hype. The squeal of the girls (and maybe some boys) in the movie house was uncalled-for.<br/><br/>I don't know for those who have read the books and have then watched the first installment of the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, but I believe the makers of the movie got it all wrong. I won't talk too much about the inaccuracies in the movie e.g. non-blonde employees of CG, the Escala which the movie portrayed as the ""headquarters"" of Grey Enterprises Holdings - wrong, the lake with small wooden pier scene - wrong (they were supposed to be in a restaurant in a small port in Seattle and that was lunch), and so much more. But then again movies based on novels are almost always like that. Inaccurate.<br/><br/>The movie, since it will be an apparent issue to some countries, should have not focused too much on the s**. CG is sweet.. is caring and is soft.. very subtly but he is. Where is that in the movie? all I saw are two small hills.<br/><br/>The first installment of the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy focused on two things (since Anastasia was, in the first two chapters of the book, an established character she did not need the character development too much n- at least in Book 1). 1) the fifty shades of F*****-up CG (which was evident in his taste was established by the fact that he is a dominant the book just vividly narrated how these are essential to CG) with the overt love for inflicting pain to his partner (the submissive) which most will call as sadism. 2) The character development of Christian Grey himself. Book 1 really emphasized on that because in the first book CG never opened up to Anastasia about his past and how his past affected his current taste (explained further in Book 2).<br/><br/>So I got disappointed because the makers of the movies should, instead, have focused on the #2 of the book not the #1. Movies are different from porn. Movies are art. Porn is something else and calls for a different discussion.<br/><br/>There were only around 10 characters that I was able to see in the movie. Where is Mrs. Robinson? Anastasia was very jealous about Mrs. Robinson. After knowing that Elena or ""Mrs. Robinson for you"" - CG. Email exchanges between AS and CG are mostly where the juice came from. Where was the part when AS got her internship at the Seattle Independent Publishing?<br/><br/>And if I am that stringent I would have loathed the fact that in the book it was only when AS graduated from college when she transferred to Seattle because that was the time she applied for an internship position at SIP (I don't know how that happened but that is the order in the book and not the other way around).<br/><br/>Lastly, Ana's best friend, Ms. Kavanagh, played a very important role in the story but she wasn't given the appropriate attention in the movie. I will say this again, the movie should have focused on the STORY rather than the sex between AS and CG. The movie did not give justice to how sweet, caring, and soft (yes he is) Christian Grey is. The movie was just sex here and there.<br/><br/>CG is messed-up but the movie was more messed-up...<br/><br/>I can probably sum up the movie with the note that Anastasia left with the model glider to Christian before she left and went home (which was the more accurate ending of the story) and I am pretty sure the people who haven't read the book and have watched the movie would not be able to understand and get. For those who read the book(s)... Am I right? we missed all those moments."
"delia_2121","5","1","5","15 February 2015"," I don't know what I expected
","I have to be honest, I read all the books and was confused with the popularity of these trilogy because the whole story is dull clich√©, written so many times before but this time with a bit of sex in it. I mean,I think that while reading these book I could literally feel my brain cells dying. Yet,I finished reading them because of some inexplainable curiosity. The same curiosity led me into the cinema. I honestly thought the movie would be even worse than the books,but I can now conclude that the movie and the book are equally mind- numbing.There was absolutely no chemistry between the main actors and that ruined the movie even more,as if the story itself was not bad enough. The BDSM parts were quite light and I was glad they were. The ending was, just like the ending in the book,made the way to leave you wanting to see more. So , I think that the sequel will be equally poor adapted but equally successful when it comes to box office. The story that includes love,lust,sex,fairytale components and deals (not very successfully) with the topic that is still a ""tabu"" in our society is bound to make a successful trend in our modern,globalized, dulled society. The only reason I give this movie 5/10 and not lower grade is because you can not expect a movie to be different than the books,better that the books. So, I recommend you to see it if you want to get disappointed and if you want to leave the cinema feeling empty or if you want to make a good laugh out of it ."

"ItsMariaChr","10","1","6","16 March 2017"," Fifty Shades Of Christian
","I saw this movie recently. I didn't read the book but it made me want to read it and so I went and bought it. I find it a very interesting movie to watch. Not your normal movie but a very decent one. <br/><br/>It shows us a young handsome businessman Mr. Grey seducing a young naive student Miss Steele who has fallen in love with him as they both explore different feelings, which leads to destruction like most passionate relationships. I can say that this kind of love is complicated but it makes it worthwhile because of the attraction of its opposites characters. It has drama and excitement.<br/><br/>What went wrong is that some parts are not written very good. Like the beginning it should have been more intriguing. The sex scenes should have been for both satisfying and the end wasn't very pleasant...<br/><br/>Honestly I would rather see Chris or Liam Hemsworth as Mr. Grey, but we can't have it all... The actor Jamie Dornan, except from some minor mistakes and parts I can say that he played Christian very well. He was very attractive & sexy and really knows how to handle a woman in a seducing and romantic way.<br/><br/>The main problem in the movie I believe is the main actress. Anastasia should have been more interesting and more flattering, that's the opposite of what Dakota Johnson offered in this film. There's not enough acting and zero chemistry with her opposite partner. I had high hopes for the female character but I think they chose wrong with her for the sexy and romantic scenes.. I wanted more romance, more passion and more sex between them. It's sad that is too late now to replace her.<br/><br/>Overall I think it's a great movie. Worthy to watch. That's my point of view."
"funkykitten_007","3","1","6","3 March 2015"," There are actually over 500 shades of grey...
","... and the fact that this franchise only sees 50 is an indication of its complete lack of depth.<br/><br/>The characters are underdeveloped, one dimensional and are motivated purely by their desire to sh*g each other, which is the entire sum of what I loosely term a plot. Their interactions are mostly awkward - they have no gradual deepening of their relationship, stick to superficial topics if they do ever talk, and their 'banter' is so forced it's cringeworthy. As for the actors, Dornan looks like he'd rather be anywhere else and Johnson's ingenue is portrayed mostly through a sotto voce, whispery tone which conversely makes her sound like she's perpetually taking calls on a sex line. Johnson, however, seems more comfortable as Ana than Dornan is as Christian, maybe because Johnson is happy to do anything (including show her lady garden to the world) for her big break while Dornan has made no bones about finding the whole thing distasteful. Grey should really be named Beige he's so uninteresting as a character aside from his (poorly-researched) grasp of kink, so I don't blame him.<br/><br/>To be fair, I expected to hate it. The books, which I suspect were written in crayon, are an insult to anyone who appreciates real literature or real BDSM or real romance. But I have honestly seen worse films: The Lone Ranger springs to mind. I got more laughs out of 50 Shades. The toast thing, and the excruciatingly forced ""Laters baby"" - hilarious!! So no, I didn't hate it, I actually had quite a good laugh at its expense. The thing is, it just isn't very good. There is no chemistry, tension (sexual or otherwise), (intentional) humour or emotion in this film to engage the viewer - and certainly no clever dialogue. It's all pretty puerile and banal from start to finish, neither romantic nor sexy. Kind of like the books.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was decent though, as other reviewers have said, but the fact that there is music in literally EVERY scene to distract from the poor script, poor acting, nonexistent storyline and nonexistent chemistry really says it all."

","Waiting eagerly in anticipation for what was hyped up to be the must-see Valentine's film-it became apparent within around 15 minutes that this film would be an immediate failure. The books lack any real plot; trying to sustain a film for 90 minutes without a storyline is undeniably a hard task and one that even Jamie Dornan couldn't master. Dakota Johnson tries to be seductive, yet her lip biting was more reminiscent of a nervous twitch and her monotonous voice dragged-like the film. Jamie And Dakota lacked any chemistry thus making the sex scenes tedious and awkward. E.L James' lacklustre writing skills have truly been exposed through this dire film, save yourself the money and buy a curry if you're after some real spice!"

","I've seen worse movies but 50 isn't what I thought or hoped it would be. It was dreadfully corny in places (Oh Mr Grey, I'm a virgin don't you know!) and didn't do anything for female sexual equality (her nipples each deserved their own credits at the end of the movie but you saw virtually nothing of him). He is lovely and I'm sure is a good actor but for me just wasn't charismatic enough in this role. Then there is the plain daft. He's a 27 year old billionaire who is a corporate giant - really, are you kidding me? And she just happens to work in a hardware store!!!! Also, that pushing the boundaries of sexual experimentation is linked to him having been abused as a very young child and arguable sexually abused as a 15 year old. Surely, if this is about sexual experimentation and freedom, this should just be motivated by adult pleasure? According to friends who have read the book, it focuses a lot on a bloke who is prepared to spend a lot of effort pleasuring a woman. But that wasn't portrayed in the movie. It was quite dark in places and I found him scary but the one thing she never said was 'blooming eck, your a bit of a weirdo aren't you?'. Consensus of opinion is 3.5 out of 10. The people sitting next to us left after about 40 mins. We found this very funny and odd - how could you not know what this movie is about?! Although it might have been that it took forever to get to the sex and then there wasn't a whole heap."

","Reviews aren't about telling you what the movie is about, you already know. What you should know is this movie was terrible. It started out OK, but went down hill. Grey isn't that hot and neither is Ana. The worst part of the film was the end. It was like driving over a cliff. It ended abruptly giving you no clue how it really ended. I don't want to assume an ending, I want to see it. My movie partner and I looked at each other at the same time and said, ""WTF""? The film would have been just OK if it had an ending, but since it didn't have one, I felt I wasted my time. Had I paid to see it, I would have been livid. Maybe they were setting up a sequel, but if that is the case, I won't be seeing the next one."
"chelseyktt","8","1","7","14 April 2015"," Of course the movie couldn't compare to the book.
","I feel as if 90% of these reviews are from either A). People who have read the book and expected more sex scenes and vulgarity, and B). those who know about BDSM relations and think this made the community under-rated. And no, I have not read the book but please.. hear me out, everyone has their opinions.<br/><br/>I'm not going to put my age out in the open, but to society, I should be considered 'too young' to know or even be able to interpret these kind of relationships and decisions they are making in this film, but I will admit I have done enough research to know that this is too much of an under-rated film. It shines just enough light on those who do know about BDSM relations and those who do not. One thing I do know is these two characters together, just balanced each other out. From the moment she stepped into his office and started the interview, she was timid and he was assertive and confident. He brought out a different light in her around the middle to end part of the film.<br/><br/>That was in fact that she was demanding (in a innocent way) what she did not agree to, and also what she wanted out of Christian. She wanted an answer to why he wanted to cause her pain when she feels as if he loves her, which is hard to comprehend in such a complex situation. <br/><br/>I really hope that I'm not insulting anyone who read the book and feels indifferent about my opinion (because I hadn't even read the book myself) but did you all that hated the movie, really expect it to be all about the sex? I hope I'm not wrong, but I'm sure they wouldn't spend a two hour film and put a love based story-line in there for the hell of it. <br/><br/>There had to be some connection and relevance in the way these characters played out. I will detail about how it was not perfect, the awkwardness of Anastasia, the virgin then all of a sudden a fiery, craving sex god. And also, how they didn't further the story behind the way Christian is the way he is, but overall, I couldn't look away and was so captivated by the way this film turned out. Hate all you want, but not everyone has to."
"pagett-communications","5","1","7","14 February 2015"," Stuff that's missing
","I think the movie went as far as it could, Maybe that was due to some form of self-censorship on the part of the director, It would not have been possible to show the sheer intensity of a full on BDSM relationship. Certainly E L James didn't put that over in her book either---maybe she was unaware of it. There are far better books out there that deal with this subject from RL experience. try reading Need by Francesca Anderssen, That book really shows what's going on inside the submissive's head. She certainly doesn't need 'persuading' like Anastasia. But then, in RL no Dom would take up with a virgin--BDSM or any other variety. The movie just doesn't get that part right. Submissives invariably know what they want, and choose the dominant to give it. It would be good to find a movie that puts over the multi-orgasmic intensity of BDSM--but maybe the general audience wouldn't believe that either. That wouldn't lessen the truth of it though"
"mrsmccullum89","3","1","10","15 February 2015"," Good story line, bad acting
","I gave Fifty Shades 3 stars because it was a good adaptation of the book from E. L. James, and the intimate scenes were well written and well acted out. I believe the writers and directors/producers did a great job in showing what they could without jeopardizing their ratings for the big screen. The reason I ONLY gave them 3 stars though was because this movie lacked Christian and Ana's personalities that were portrayed better in the book. I understand that certain things need to be taken out to fit the time frame of a film. But acting and personality should not be lost because of that fact. Christian was much more tame and composed than what he should have been. I believe he is a man who is FIFTY SHADES. He has multiple personalities, such as being troubled, controlling, and angry 80% of the time. None of those persona's showed on the big screen. Also, Ana has a sense of humor about her, and was defiant towards Christian with his controlling issues in the first book, and that was not shown as well with her in the film. I believe these stars did not live up to my expectations as the characters of Anastasia and Christian Grey whatsoever. And that their personalities of those characters were immensely watered down. I do hope to see some improvement in their characters in the future films to come. I hope that the personalities unfold and break through for the fans watching."
"jboothmillard","4","1","30","22 February 2015"," Fifty Shades of Grey
","The racy novel by E.L. James, the first in a trilogy of books, became a phenomenon in 2012, I read most of the first few chapters myself, I laughed at how both naive and so bad it's good it was, I knew a movie adaptation was going to be a big talking point, so I had to see it, from Razzie nominated director Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Boy). Basically Vancouver college undergraduate Anastasia ""Ana"" Steele (Razzie winning Dakota Johnson) shares an apartment with best friend and roommate Katherine ""Kate"" Kavanagh (Eloise Mumford), when Kate becomes ill she agrees to step in and, for the college newspaper, interview young corporate executive Christian Grey (The Fall's Razzie winning Jamie Dornan), head of his own company in Seattle, during their meeting he appears to show an interest in her. Later Ana is working part-time as usual at the hardware store and Christian appears to arrive ""accidentally"", he is buying cable ties, duct tape and rope, they engage in some small talk, during which he agrees participate in a photo shoot for some original stills for the college newspaper article, during which Christian continues to show interest in Ana. They have a coffee together where they can talk some more, impressed by Ana and learning her interest in literature he arranges to have first editions of Tess of the d'Urbervilles sent to her home, on the same day Ana goes out drinking with her friends, she calls Christian in a drunken state, he senses her being drunk, with her not telling him where she is he says he will come to get her, before passing out Ana sees Kate flirting with Christian's brother Elliot (Luke Grimes), and Ana wakes up in Christian's hotel, she is relieved to find that they did not have sex. They may have had an awkward start, but Christian and Ana share a passionate kiss in the elevator, and they start dating afterwards, one of which he explains that he does want to be with her, but he has ""particular tastes"" and wants her to sign a non-disclosure agreement contract, regarding their relationship, he has an interest in a subculture relationship with Ana involving controlled bondage, she is shown his ""play room"", i.e. The Red Room, filled with bondage devices and tools. It is at this point though that Ana reveals her true naivety to sex, she is a virgin, so Christian takes her to the bedroom and slowly undresses her, they have sex and sex is no longer a virgin, enlightened she is intrigued by this relationship agreement, so he tells her to take the contract with her to read carefully, it details the roles of the ""submissive"" and the ""dominant"", dietary and physical conditions, sleeping arrangements, and much more, she may ask questions about aspects, and he says he will only do what she agrees to. Christian and Ana do have a business like meeting to discuss conditions in the contract, he says he will allow her the decision of occasional couple dates, e.g. dinner, movies, and she goes through sexual acts she will not allow, to which he crosses them out, and the following few days Christian showers her with gifts and favours, including a new laptop to email him, and a new car, and although she has not signed the agreement he continues to carry out sexual experimentation. Keeping up the casual aspect of their relationship Ana goes for dinner to Christian adoptive family, father Carrick (Andrew Airlie), mother Dr. Grace Trevelyan Grey (Marcia Gay Harden) and sister Mia (singer Rita Ora), during the dinner Ana reveals she is leaving soon to visit her mother Carla (Jennifer Ehle) in Georgia, Christian is angry and Ana wants a romantic relationship more than just sexual, she leaves and does go to see her mother, but she is shocked when he surprises her while they are drinking together, the next morning he takes her gliding, before he has to leave for an emergency in Seattle. Soon after arriving home Ana continues to see Christian, she is initially consenting and participates in his further sexual experimentation, however he continues to be distant emotionally which upsets her, Ana asks Christian to show her what he really wants, so they have an encounter involving rough sex. Ana sees this as disturbing and not within the bounds of her romantic expectations of Christian, she becomes resolved that he is not the right man for her and that his experimentation borders on being deviant and excessive, in the end at her insistence Ana and Christian part company in the hallway outside his apartment, uttering only each other's names as the doors to the elevator close. Also starring Victor Rasuk as Jos√© Rodriguez, Callum Keith Rennie as Ray Steele and Dylan Neal as Bob Adams. Johnson is reasonable as the beautiful and innocent girl who wants to find love in the S&M obsessed man, Dornan is just about suited as the mysterious rich man with dark sexual interests, the pair do make an intriguing enough couple, I agree with the mixed reviews, I was expecting more sadomasochism than there was, there are a fair amount of arousing sex scenes, starting with the sweet virginity losing scene through to being tied up and blindfolded, but I agree the most filthy scene is the two discussing sexual stuff in the contract, there is somewhat of a love story aside the S&M stuff, it may have been laughably cheesy and tame, but like the book you cannot help but sort of like it, it may have swept the Golden Raspberry Awards, but it's not such a bad erotic romantic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Original Song for ""Earned It"" by The Weeknd, it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""Love Me Like You Do"" by Ellie Goulding, and it won the Razzies for Worst Picture (tied with Fantastic Four), Worst Screen Combo for Dornan and Johnson and Worst Screenplay.

It makes Anna actually strong and powerful and it separates her sexual side from her public life. The problem I have with this film is it thinks Anna has to be meek and nervous and afraid just to be a submissive. NOT TRUE. Not to mention Christian is obviously a sociopath and not a dominant. FLYING ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO MEET YOUR PARTNER WHEN SHE SAYS SHE NEEDS SPACE IS NOT PROTECTIVE IT'S ABUSIVE. I wasn't expecting much from this movie but I was still left disappointed with just about everything. The things I liked were the soundtrack, cinematography and that's about it. It isn't the worst thing I've seen but if this is what everyone thinks BDSM is then I wish it was never made.

It's so gross the way Christian forces Ana to do things his way and is only under moral question until the very end. Another thing is is that the second to last sex scene has this weird almost angelic song in the background which you would expect to see in a martial arts movie when the character evolves or finishes of the enemy. It doesn't fit the scene at all and I just hate it. This movie was made so that a bunch of horny creepy people could be excepted by getting horny at there weird kinks.

There is no depth to the character and the acting is beyond poor. Same with Anastasia, the actress has played the part so poorly that it's infuriating. They have cut out so many important scenes or have slightly rewritten them so that you do not understand the characters like they are shown in the book. Even the sex scenes are so poorly done compared to the books, they were so much better and showed that fifty was all about trust and finding connection with Anna. Yes fifty liked to punish his subs in the book, but he also made it very clear to Anna what she would be getting into. Because he did not want to take advantage of her. Where in the movie this is shown more like he is a predator.

Later, they have sex, like every single weekend, but Ana doesn't agree with how Grey treats her and other women, and they break up, ending the movie at a very low note and a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>For a pure-drama film, I'd say it would probably put me up to 4 stars. But as a romance film, this is such a total disappointment. If you're looking for something better than this total piece of junk, then I would suggest watching My Big Fat Greek Wedding or Coming Home For Christmas. Or better yet, just read a romance novel instead. There is now a lot more romance novels than movies that what there used to be. And every adaption of the book to be turned into a movie turns out to become a huge failure."

","Although it's absurd to portray a BDSM relationship as simply abusive, and the characters are boring cardboard cutouts, some of that I quite enjoyed. Occasionally it makes fun of itself and can genuinely deserve a smile. This film is quite well shot visually, with balanced, eye-catching frames and beautiful Seattle landscape visuals. The soundtrack and songs were really tonally perfect, although I didn't see the movie as a love story as much as an off-balance portrayal of a group of people already degraded and misunderstood."

","Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is a young virginal college literature major not named Bella. When she interviews media mogul Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), who is not a vampire, sparks fly as they connect. He is handsome and seemingly perfect. She is shy and dowdy. As their relationship builds we discover that Christian learned everything he needed to know about relationships from watching ""9 1/2 Weeks"" and ""The Story of O."" The film is an exaggeration of the male and female psyche in ""the relationship."" He cannot open up and share his ""feelings"" and only wants kinky sex and to care for the woman. She however wants that 10 minutes of cuddling after sex and intimate conversation. Each one attempts to change the other.<br/><br/>The people in the film are cardboard figures.

"eliza_gaskell","5","0","1","1 October 2017"," Just an OK movie
","Where do I begin? Lets start with the good stuff... Firstly there is the music score by Danny Elfman gets a big stamp of approval.(barely). Secondly, Cimentogrphy by Seamus McGarvey was fantastic and beautiful. And lastly, the over all Style of the film with production design was sleek. So what was the issue. It is in my opinion:<br/><br/>CONTROL: the author E.L. James massive ego killed it for me. It is very difficult to translate a book to film successfully but it can be done. Schindler's List, Gorilla's in the Mist, The Great Gatsby, Silence of the Lambs and Atonement to name a few. But with this film it's did not come across. And this is a prime example of the author, E.L. James having too much control on the source material. Whenever the film tries to be a movie because somethings in novels cannot be translated into a visual medium, E.L.James practically chokes it back to a novel format. Slap my forehead, Fifty Shades has the full symptoms of The Phantom Menace. We've seen this happen with George Lucas controlling influences and his team of ""yes"" people<br/><br/>CASTING: the two main leads Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornam; two good looking people who ""should"" have and can act. But in Fifty Shades of Grey they both look like this is their first acting job. There was no soul or believable in the characters of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. So it comes down to casting. If the leads are right..like Clarke Gable and Vivien Leigh in Gone With The Wind..the film can be good. And sometimes exception, for example, Lord Of the Ring trilogy.<br/><br/>WRITING (SCRIPT). The story is very simplistic. Boy meets girl. Fall in love and they go through the tribulations of a relationship. But likes kinky stuff, girl doesn't like it but she has hit the jackpot. She has successfully nabbed a billionaire. So she goes along with it. Script is so bad that a 5 year old could of written it better. And it has E.L. James in the writing credits. A middle age woman with no previous experience as a film writer. There are parts where you get the feeling something is right, or important information for the audience are glossed over. Scenes that need further exploration are abruptly ended. Dialogue is stiff and goes into the territory of...oh God help us...yep...Daytime television. <br/><br/>CHARACTERS:. Ana is poorly develops, weak and needs a man to rescue her. She has no ambitions a of a modern woman, no driving force that motivates her to follow her destiny. NOTHING!!! No interest, no hobbies, no backbone. Christian JUST is dull and boring. A handsome man with absolutely no real character arc. Is he arrogant? NO Is he an interesting person? NO Does he go through life changing events in the movie which affect him and Ana, he grows and become a different person. But do we get this on screen. NOPE the audience has been ripped off. Christain is the same person as he is in the beginning. Think about, what truly changed him as a character, what event categorically changed the fundamentally of this character. And there it is again, what were all the characters motivations in this movie? Sadly all the characters lacked connectivity with the audience and came across as fake.<br/><br/>I don't want to trash Fifty Shades of Grey like many critics and reviewers, because honestly, we've seen worst. I will say this is an OK movie not a masterpiece."

","Where to begin on this movie. I could rattle off mistakes and errors as long as a Torah and they'd be all to do with this one movie but to save people and me the time I'm just gonna name a few. Casting , directing , plot , overall pre film hype and the list goes on and on and on. Starting with casting I do think that people have been a little more than critical sometimes in Rita Ora's role of Mia Grey as I think more screen time would have been more of a true reflection to judge her character to see how she faired on screen as it's not easy mastering a different art form different to your preferred profession (just look at Cara Delevigne before she did Valerian) and where they decided to cast Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele came from I don't know. I have seen actors/actresses play worse parts (like Abigail Breslin playing Baby in a Dirty Dancing remake) and that I don't believe really is her fault as a performer you can only take a role so far. The plot of the film comes as this mysterious rich good looking man of many talents that has many secrets he doesn't tell. It's not a terrible movie and it's target audience probably isn't aimed towards me or most men in particular but from a reviewers point of view it could be better. <br/><br/>Casting 4/10- Jamie Dornan slowly and transitionally looked he was still finding the role as an actor and was good in places but a wrong casting with Dakota Johnson. <br/><br/>Plot 2/10- No real love story to the piece. Mainly focuses on domination and erotic scenes which might have been it's aim but possibly I thought it was more of a love story theme as a genre. <br/><br/>Pre-film hype 3/10- It was successful in the box office so it's doing something right but mainly a film that reaches a target audience of the female gender."

","A normal and shy girl gets to interview a very wealthy man and soon after, against all expectations, they start dating. Their relationship is very far away from being normal, as he is a very difficult character with many necessities and desires, as she'll soon find out. Due to his posture and financial position, he's able to offer very expensive and diverse gifts but in return, he demands complete obedience and loyalty, even coming up with a contract regarding their private life, with many clauses which are to be respected by both parts. Although she seems happy on the outside, she was expecting more from this relationship and the aspects she's about to find about her partner will prove to be questionable, to say the least.<br/><br/>It's a movie which had an interesting premise, of a normal poor girl which enters an unexpected relationship with a person who's out of her league, but soon gains a stereotypical course of events which seems to come directly from a soap opera. They fight, make up using one of his expensive gifts, fight again and so on. Nothing interesting happens and the interest which was present in the beginning soon fades away. Unfortunately, much more disappointing than the main part of the movie is the finale, which ends abruptly, without any warning or logic. I can understand when the producers of a movie want to create suspense for a sequel but this is exaggerated. It ends just like a soap opera¬Ö<br/><br/>As an overall thought, I'm pretty much disappointed about every aspect of this movie, except the soundtrack which is simply astonishing.

"iriscloudsea","3","0","1","14 August 2017"," Whatever it is, it's awkward all the way.
","I saw so many low reviews here, then I just finished watching it, I feel the urge to justify what I just watched.<br/><br/>I've never read the book, never felt that I have to watch this whatsoever, I do have friends active in dungeon scenes and BDSM but this movie is not related to any of the hardcore stuff at all, and no inspiration at all. This movie is not ""legit"" BDSM, not legit ""porn"", not legit ""obscure poetry"", not legit ""Love Story"". <br/><br/>It's just a piece of AWKWARD patchwork.<br/><br/>Basically it's a story of a newly graduated girl who's virgin to love and to sex and fell for a rich okay-looking guy who has issues expressing true emotions cos of childhood trauma and blah blah blah, and he thinks BDSM is his way-out.<br/><br/>Basically that's it. <br/><br/>What makes me think the whole movie is an award patchwork is that.. 1. In the beginning they fell for each other super quickly by simply staring at each other All The Time(that explained why people feel both leads acting quite poorly). There's no clue or reason why he/she? Because she's stupid/pretty/naive??? because he is the only successful sorta okay-looking young biz man left? Nothing suggested in the beginning, nor later. Just leave audience like what??!! (so this is the flattest way you could to interpret love at first sight) And where does that emotional attachment between two characters that director you try to build come from??<br/><br/>2. If people are looking forward to some steamy scenes, and/or take a glimpse to BDSM, this movie is way too disappointing. The movie amplified Anastasia's(played by Dakota Johnson) nervousness, naivety, fear and Trying, to boost Grey's(played by Jamie Dornan) S/M behaviors. And it turned out no emotional calls to the audience, no real steamy actions appeared to empower the dark theme the audience may have wished to be surprised...There are way more European erotic movies and/or porn at least provide the sensation, sometimes even knowledge. Not even European erotic movies, one French movie called Les Regrets, it's about two people in their 40s fell for each other, sex scenes in that was even more appealing and enjoyable than this one. <br/><br/>3. Details in the movie, lives of 2 leads and so forth, seemed super redundant. Some reviews here said Grey is a stalker, but hey some boys/girls love to show up to give the other half surprise. The problem is the pacing of the normal life scenes were shot so boring and so flat(there's no powerful punch in this movie that make the audience care) No point, no connections in details themselves. Anastasia's mom and dad have no function and no inspiration in this movie. Their roles could have been deleted. Grey's suit and demeanor are so stiff that it confused me if the actor's acting really bad or the character is stiff in such a horribly boring way. <br/><br/>I felt Dakota Johnson was trying to play a poor lovely girl and it was okay to me but I wished the director and male lead could have been different. It's just an awkward patchwork."

","I haven't read the novel so I can't compare the movie with the book. The movie seems like a steamy fantasy of a master of English literature. Perhaps it is a fantasy of the author herself. Is it coincidence the protagonist is a graduating English Literature major? Ana Steele (Dakota Johnson) is a graduating college students whose roommate has an interview with 27-year-old billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Drnan). The roommate becomes sick and Ana offers to go in her place. Christian and Ana are instantly attracted, and the next day, Christian visits Ana at work. One night, Ana is out and gets drunk. Christian arrives to her rescues, taking a passed out Ana back to his place. He doesn't take advantage of her and the two begin a relationship, which seems normal at first. In a romantic comedy style, the morning after their first real night together, Ana makes breakfast in a button down shirt, complete with ""Beast of Burden"" by the Stones playing. They are comically interrupted by an unexpected visit from Christian's mother. Soon, Christian reveals his true colors. He's controlling and wants a dominant relationship, particularly when the lights go out, although he's completely open about it‚Äîso open he wants Ana to sign a contact, submitting to his desires. This is not new to Christian. He tells Ana she is #16. Ana struggles with the decision to sign the contract, while struggling with her feelings towards Christian. Christian struggles with his own emotions as he tries to woo Ana into signing the contract. Truly a steamy thriller, but different then what's out there. It starts off slow but it is necessary for character development. The producers must've had fun with the MPAA board to keep the rating at R and not NC-17. Clearly the target audience is women, but it's cerebral enough that a guy can appreciate it."

It's a kind of trashy, pretty pornographic book put onto a cinema friendly big screen...<br/><br/>You're not going to get full on sexual content because the 18 certificate doesn't allow it, so of course the sex isn't going to live up to the books. The book itself revolves tightly around the 2 main characters (as far as I know) and their SPOILERS relationship/sexual contract and indeed, that's what you get.<br/><br/>The acting doesn't seem great and the toned down sexual content could easily disappoint viewers expecting better, but if you go in expecting these things as I did, it's a lot less offensive than people seem to be finding it. I'd say the worse things about it are the main female character's acting, she can be pretty annoying to watch, and her Lip-Biting-Count although even that is only about 3... but that is already 2 too much.<br/><br/>You might not agree with my review or find it useful, but that's my view on the movie.

","Not sure what all the fuss was about in terms of sexual content with this first of the trilogy movies: you see more sex in one episode of the television show 'Shameless'. There was very good casting with some of the actors: Max Martini as Taylor (looking forward to seeing more of him in the second film), and Eloise Mumford as Ana's best friend Kate (beautiful as well as an excellent actress, although her part in the film was smaller than in the book). The film is limited as to what can be achieved in 2 hours: There was so much more content in the book than in the film. And there lies the challenge. I think the scriptwriters could have done a better job to include more dialogue to clarify: how Ana's parents reacted to Christian (as well as Christian's parents to Ana), and how upset Ana became as the story progressed, as she was subjected to matters with which she lacked understanding. They didn't convey how Kate was aware that Christian was making Ana ""cry all the time now"" as she dealt with her feelings of confusion, and was very protective of her friend. There could have been many more meaningful glances from Christian to show how totally enraptured he is with Ana, how this attraction is supposed to grow throughout the story, and his constant inner battles that she must be too naive for him to initiate into this 'lifestyle' so he should leave her alone. Still, the locations and sets were spot on, the content which was included was very true to the book, and overall the director did a good job to capture this budding 'romance'."

","I didn't expect to enjoy this movie at all, but, to my surprise, I did. It is a movie about the struggle for sexual recognition and freedom. It is about a couple who love each other, but they cannot give in and completely surrender to each other's desires. This movie is deeply existential and Sartrian. In love, as Sartre says,""the lover wants to be 'the whole world' for the beloved"", and sexual desire is mainly about conflict (in the Hegelian sense of the master and slave dialectic). In this struggle for owning each other and subjugating each other's desires (in other to affirm our freedom as individuals), they both lose. Although they both understand the game of sex and love in the end, they are unwilling to play by it (by surrendering) and they both end up hurt. <br/><br/>I was also very impressed by how feminist the movie is. He is obsessed with obtaining her consent. All her experience with men was with men who were totally indifferent to her desires and consent. Remember the man (her friend outside the pub when she was totally drunk) who was almost forcing himself upon her just to get a kiss. The movie shows us what real consent looks like: straightforward, negotiated, not taken for granted, with safe words with are able to communicate refusal. And, precisely because of this, it is seen as unromantic. Yes, our culture eroticizes sexual violence and rape and we would rather criticise the man who asks us explicitly if we consent than the man who takes it for granted and doesn't care. The main character is obsessed with getting her consent. He is very attentive to her wants and desires. She is not used to it and that's precisely why it seems so strange to her (and to us). <br/><br/>I didn't rate it that well, despite all the good things in it, because it is not directed very well, the actors are not that good and they could have tried a bit better with the script. So, it is not a good movie overall, but it makes many excellent points."

","I started out reading the books awhile ago before I saw the movie because I'm one of those people who will read a book before watching the film and I have to say that this was definitely a good adaption. I now, after watching it the first time, have watched it too many times to count. To begin with, the plot line is perfect if not lacking a few scenes from the book or adapting them slightly. The actors play the characters perfectly too and are how I would imagine them to be from the books and can no longer imagine them any other way. They give the characters some emotion, backstory and personality and I would not have them any other way. The sex scenes are...should we say very interesting and are again mostly how they are imagined in the book. I love this movie and it is one of my favorites and not only because of the sex scenes but because of the stories and their character arcs leading to the end."
"Imdbidia","6","0","1","2 February 2017"," Underdeveloped, not erotic, but not that bad either
","There has been so much fuss about the book on which this movie is based upon, and the movie itself that I decided that I give it a try out of curiosity. <br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Gray is mostly an exploration of erotic love and of relationship dynamics, which is what is shown most of the time in the film. Two people fall in love but there are important things that aren't provided by the other, things demanded by the other that cannot be easily fulfilled by their partner. The story is also about a girl growing up into a woman, i.e. a girl going from wanting to please to be loved, to a woman who has needs and is not afraid of letting the relationship go if those aren't fulfilled. The story also explores why some men, in this case Grey, are into BDSM, why do they need to punish women and have a dominating sexual relationship to get erotic pleasure. I thought that all those things are real issues that affect real people all the time. I've come across directly or indirectly with men who were very similar to Grey, a sweet well-mannered outside and twisted souls inside that were into practicing BDSM to feel ""a man"".<br/><br/>For me this movie is nothing to be passionate about, in any way. I didn't find the movie as shocking or bad as some people portray it, but I found it underdeveloped: sketched story, superficial exploration of the characters, TV-film production not Big-Screen production, and not really erotic.<br/><br/>The main point of the film is getting to know why Grey is into kinky stuff, but this is barely sketched because this is, clearly, the first of a series of movies, and it was clear even before the last installment came along.<br/><br/>I thought that Dakota Johnson does a good job in the film, perhaps the best of the cast, and goes from naive girl to a woman in a believable way.<br/><br/>I thought that Dornan was not the actor for this role because the character needed of somebody with more dramatic register and a bit of an edge. Dornan doesn't have it, unfortunately. I thought he would be great in a normal romance movie, not in this one.<br/><br/>I thought the Dornan and Johnson have no real chemistry on camera and the erotic scenes didn't turn me on at all, which is totally anticlimactic. I remember, in contrast, how good Nine Weeks and Half was at exploring a couple's intimate relationship with eroticism. The art of the erotic is not in having a sex scene, it is in the way you construct that scene and, most importantly, in the way the two people involved in it seemed to be into each other and enjoying it. I felt that Dornan and Johnson weren't fully present there.<br/><br/>To the puritans and haters I would say that there are few sex scenes in the film but not too many. That there is nudity but no full frontal nudity and no genitalia are on display. That this is supposedly portraying a BDSM relationship but it is actually showing more a BDSM fantasy that real BDSM. That even though the male character is dominating the woman character, they have fully agreed on advance on that being consensual. That although there are sex scenes, there are films that aren't portrayed a sex movies and have plenty more sex and rougher one and nobody focus on those things when commenting on the film. Finally, if erotic scenes and intimate relationships really worry you, or you cannot deal with them, don't watch the movie :).<br/><br/>Overall, an interesting plot, never fully developed, not a good direction or production, but not as bad as I expected."

","Oh you guys! You love to hate Fifty Shades. It's fashionable to trash and sledge it. I thought it was all right. Dakota Johnson was perfect for her role. Jamie Dornan was not as good, but he is really committed to the role and is watchable. The lighting and direction are good. The script has nice elements of humour and largely avoids clunky soap opera dialogue. It's wrong that Johnson has most of the nudity of the two leads. The sex scenes are quite tasteful, if a bit slick. The movie tries hard with a believable plot about Christian Grey shying away from real intimacy due to abuse. The supporting cast including the lovely Marcia Gay Harden as Christian's mother, are great. One objection I have is that the abrupt ending is so blatantly left open for a sequel, it's ridiculous. But overall, a surprisingly good film"

","So before i actually review this I must say one major thing: I skipped through all the sex scenes, and there were a lot of them. Now apart from that I understand wholly why a lot of people dislike this movie. The soft-core sex scenes were excessive, unrealistic, and lacking of actual chemistry between the main characters Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. But like I said earlier, I merely skipped those scenes. So what's left is the true story-line of a billionaire man who was taken advantage of as a naive child and has no other was to express himself than through the same form of ""pleasure"" he is accustom to in the first place. The reaction and depths of both Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele is more than what is focused on in the movie. The struggle Anna has to understand the horror of Christian's life and past is quite memorizing. It is a true challenge to understand the trauma that occurs in a past like Christian's; let alone try to understand his trauma through the same ""torture"" or ""pleasure"" the he himself had to grow accustom too. I was sincerely surprised by the past that Christian Grey had; my thoughts coming into this movie were primarily that it was another sex-addict's happy movie and that I would eventually add this movie to the list of disappointing movies I've watched, however, I am pleased by the background that is provided through the movie. My main issue with the movie (aside from excessive sex scenes) is that the ending was so abrupt and lacking that I was more mad by that part than intrigued by the movie. I will happily wait though from Fifty Shades Darker to come this February to see where this leads."

","I've read all three books, so I had to see the movie. The books are INCREDIBLE, but so much of the book was left out of the movie! I guess I can understand why some of it would have to have been cut out, so they could get an r-rating, but they didn't leave enough in for people who are meeting Anastasia and Christian for the first time. I think, if you haven't read the books, you won't really understand what the relationship means to each of the characters or how it changed who they were as people. I can only imagine what I'd have been thinking, while watching the movie, if I hadn't ""met"" the characters in the books before hand. I don't think I'd of liked the plot or storyline or chemistry between the two lead actors either, like a lot of viewers who have written reviews about this movie. I'm hoping the second and third movies are better at showing the personalities and characters of the two leads and better at showing what this relationship really is and what the relationship means to them each. The movie, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", made it seem as though Anastasia was this fragile, nieve, stupid little girl. It made Christian seem like all he is, is this rich, ""I get what I want, when I want it"" kind of axxhole, who only cares about himself. In the book, you can see how this relationship changes how they see themselves. The movie doesn't fully explain how the relationship has made each of them, in completely different ways, stronger people.<br/><br/>Like I said, I loved the books, but the movie left me upset and wanting, no needing more. I will still be going to see the next two movies, when they come out, even though I really do not expect them to be any better. Well, I don't know, the third book really doesn't have a whole lot of sexual stuff in it, so now that I think about it, I think the 3rd movie will actually be great."

How was that relevant?<br/><br/>No matter where Ana goes, Christian ALWAYS finds out where she's at. The movie never explains how Christian was able to know Ana's exact location all the time, even when Ana was in Georgia to visit her mom, Christian knew exactly where to find her.<br/><br/>This movie has some of the worst acting I've ever seen. I expect this kind of acting from an indie movie but this acting was just boring and bad, especially from Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan.<br/><br/>This movie is basically boring dialogue and sex, I can't even call it ""sex"" it's more like bondage. Christian apparently loves whipping people when they're naked.<br/><br/>Christian wants to be with Ana so badly that he gives her a contract stating that he would be her ""dominant"" and Ana will be his ""submissive"". The contract was asking for Ana's consent for specific sexual acts like ""anal fisting"", ""vaginal fisting"", and even the use of ""butt plugs"" when Ana asked Christian ""what's a butt plug?"" WTF?! The dialogue was so bad and awkward most of the time.<br/><br/>I did not feel bad for Ana at all. Apparently, she loves Christian so much that she allows him to whip her and tie her hands when they're in bed together. And when Ana breaks a rule or something, Christian ""punishes"" her by whipping her even harder while she's naked.<br/><br/>This movie never explains why Christian does what he does.

","When handsome billionaire and closeted sexual dominant, Christian Grey meets timid, virginal college girl Anastasia ""Ana"" Steele he sees great submissive potential in her and goes to great lengths to pursue her.<br/><br/>And by 'great lengths' I mean try to control every aspect of her life and by 'pursue' I mean stalk her relentlessly.<br/><br/>For obvious reasons I went into this movie with very low expectations, but it wasn't as bad as I thought. Don't get me wrong, it's bad; a given seeing as though the source material it's based upon is bad... and the source material that's based upon is bad. But a lot of what is wrong with it is mostly due to E.L. James' problematic writing, which I can't fully blame upon the film makers (who, to give credit where it's due, seemed to go out of their way to make a glossy, slick looking movie.)<br/><br/>For example, when Christian declares, ""I don't 'make love'. I ****... hard"" to Ana only then to apparently 'make love' to her in the very next scene after she reveals to him that she is still a virgin.<br/><br/>Or how he repeatedly tells her that he is not good for her and she is to stay away from him, but when she does exactly that he pursues her and tries to persuade her yet again to become his submissive.<br/><br/>Or how Ana keeps asking Christian to show her what she's in for if she agrees to his demands and then getting angry when she doesn't like it.<br/><br/>She redeems herself slightly in the contract negotiation scene where she tries to meet him halfway by agreeing to the things that she is comfortable with and eliminating the things that she isn't, but then she's right back to agreeing to letting him do what he wants to her and getting upset when she doesn't like it.<br/><br/>Well, you get the idea."
"DevastatngDiva","5","0","2","6 January 2016"," Extra star for the soundtrack
","This movie is an example of what can happen when the author of a poorly written book has too much creative control over the movie adaptation. In particular, the source material is essentially a kinky-sexed up Harlequin Romance novel: entertaining but definitely not Pulitzer worthy. The screenwriters took what could have easily become a ""backroom video"" and created a commercial film by streamlining the plot, beefing up the comedic elements and toning down the erotica. Unfortunately, there were small plot turns peppered throughout the movie that were so disjointed that left the audience and (most likely) the actors struggling to understand the characters.<br/><br/>While Dakota Johnson did well in her portrayal of the naive Anastasia Steele, her scripted expressions often seemed unnatural. She did, however, project the appropriate emotions beautifully when left to her own devices. On the other hand, Jamie Dornan's swoon worthy looks could not help his performance. He was unbelievable as the prodigious-but- broken Christian Grey. His attempts at restrained and self possessed came across as frat-boy-creepy and his ""boss mode"" seemed whiny with the seriousness of a six year old playing make-believe.<br/><br/>Moreover, the soundtrack masked but couldn't completely overcome the utter lack of chemistry between the two actors. When they were supposed to be looking, lovingly, into one another's eyes, the only emotions conveyed were disdain and/or disgust. Unfortunately, most of scenes that would have make the audience believe these two characters were actually falling in love were cut.<br/><br/>In sum, while it's not the worst movie ever made, I wouldn't rush to DVR it."

","I read the trilogy and also Grey. I admit the book was better. But, whatever reviews I have seen here only mentions how bad the sex was. Why can't anyone see the passionate love story in it? Also, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson had the perfect chemistry. But as many say, the sex scenes didn't have the anticipated effect and this is because it is a movie watched by the public and there's a limit in which everything could be portrayed. Well, I was disappointed in only one thing that they could have shown Anastasia's love for Twining's English Breakfast Tea. Also, the people who were disappointed that the sex was not spicy enough for them to release can easily enter into a porn site to fulfill their needs. I think the movie was good to watch. I am sure that Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed will be much more good because there comes the real love in the trilogy. Waiting for the movies."

There are more than a few moments in the film that seem to correlate to Fifty Shades, although the same could be said for other movies and books of the erotic, S/M genre. But the one fact that both male main characters are named Mr. Grey seems too much of a coincidence. Just my opinion that 50 Shades could have possibly been based on this movie...."
"JamesHitchcock","6","0","1","29 December 2015"," Of Inhuman Bondage
","There is a scene in ""Educating Rita"" in which the heroine is reading a copy of Somerset Maugham's novel ""Of Human Bondage"" on a bus. ""Ooh, my husband's got lots of books like that"" says the woman sitting next to her. ""What, Somerset Maugham books?"" ""No, bondage books!""<br/><br/>Bondage books may at one time have been the province of the dirty old man, but in 2011 they became a literary sensation with the immense success of E. L. James' ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". I have never read Ms James' magnum opus, sadomasochism not being my thing, so cannot speculate as to just why it proved so popular, but I caught the film adaptation when it was recently shown on television. The precise significance of the title is never explained in the film, although I presume it is a play on the main male character's surname. (I note that even though this is an American production the British spelling ""Grey"" is not Americanised to ""Gray"" in the title).<br/><br/>The story deals with Anastasia Steele, a college student who begins a relationship with Christian Grey, a brilliant young entrepreneur who has become a billionaire at the tender age of 27. Nobody in a movie is ever referred to as a ""millionaire"" these days, now that a million pounds is no longer a fortune but merely the top prize in a gameshow. When I was at school, I was taught that a ""billion"" meant a million million. Now it has been devalued to mean a thousand million, probably to suit America's super-rich who needed a word which would set them apart from mere millionaires or even multi-millionaires.<br/><br/>The film is not a comedy, but it makes use of one standard romantic comedy plot device; there always has to be some obstacle standing between the two lovers and their happiness. Here the obstacle is Christian's strange taste in love-making. He is not interested in any form of sexual activity which does not involve sadomasochistic humiliation and wants Anastasia to play the ""submissive"" to his ""dominant"". He even makes her enter into a bizarre ""contract"" in which they agree which sexual practices will be permissible between them and which will not.<br/><br/>Several actors, including Ryan Gosling, turned down the part of Christian because they were not interested in the character, and I can understand why. Jamie Dornan, who was eventually cast, does not get much out of the role, but then there is perhaps not a lot to get. We hear something of Christian's back story, of his hard childhood and of how he was seduced at the age of fifteen by an older woman who introduced him to sadomasochistic practices, and the implication is that these experiences have left him damaged goods, psychologically speaking, but I felt that we needed to know a lot more about his past in order to understand his character.<br/><br/>Anastasia, however, is more interesting. She is happy to go along with Christian's whims, although it seems quite clear that she regards them with, at best, bemusement and, at worst, disgust. At first I wondered if she had been persuaded to try and conceal her revulsion by the thought of all the billions she would enjoy should she ever become Mrs Christian Grey, but the truth is more complicated, and Anastasia less mercenary, than that. It gradually becomes clear that she has quite genuinely fallen in love with Christian, who away from the bedroom can be charming and generous. (I say ""away from the bedroom"", but actually that is not quite accurate. As far as Christian is concerned bedrooms are only for sleeping and not for sex; all his sexual encounters with Anastasia take place in a special chamber). She finds it difficult to cope with the thought that the two of them want quite different things from their relationship. She wants romance and tenderness, whereas he simply wants sexual pleasure, and her difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that his idea of sexual pleasure is very different from hers.<br/><br/>There is a surprising amount of psychological depth, at least as far as Anastasia is concerned, and Dakota Johnson (daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) proves a surprisingly likable heroine. On the basis of this film she strikes me as a better actress than her mother; I was never able to sympathise with any of Melanie's characters in the way I can with Anastasia. Dakota's performance here reminded me more closely of her grandmother, Tippi Hedren, in Hitchcock's ""Marnie"", another sexually charged drama about an ill-matched couple.<br/><br/>I must admit that I watched the film more out of idle curiosity than out of any real interest in its subject-matter. It is not, however, simply some pornographic romp, which is what I feared it might be. Yes, there are sex scenes, but then it would have been difficult to make a film out of this particular story without sex scenes. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is not in the same class as ""Marnie"", but it is considerably better than I thought it would be. 6/10"

","I decided to view Fifty Shades of Grey without having read the book and with a limited awareness of the controversy around the movie. However, the only way to judge a movie is to actually watch it. So I did. My reaction was positive to the characters and acting and the excellent film-making. <br/><br/>Christian Grey, played by James Dornan, uses women to fulfil his particular taste for pleasure and the women he engages are free to leave him at any time. Based on the advice of his lawyer, he also signs ironclad contracts with each one. The previous women have all left him, some 15 altogether. This time, the young woman played by Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele, is not about to rush in and there is an understanding on both sides to go slow for a while. Anastasia knows what the deal is and Christian is sincere about having her consent. However, Christian is not about to tell her what are his preferences in sexuality. <br/><br/>There is a definite courtship pattern, where the super-wealthy Grey, while serious and cool, can still be very seductive. There is a definite attraction on both sides. When negotiating the contract, she makes it clear that she wants certain clauses deleted. He agrees to her requests without hesitation. In fact, she can stop doing what she agrees to at any point in the relationship or at any point in their activities. <br/><br/>At one point, he finds out how inexperienced she is and proceeds to correct matters in a way that is erotic and sensuous. The next morning she is glowing with satisfaction. Her best friend can sense her happiness. The trouble is that Grey cannot go along with Anastasia's idea of a ""normal"" relationship. At his urging, she allows it to go in another direction and she does not stop him. She tries to get him to open up and discovers that he himself had a relationship in which he was dominated, by a friend of his mother. The lessons learnt stayed with him. We sense that Anastasia may be softening him but he is not about to set aside his cold demeanour or his tastes in sexuality.<br/><br/>After viewing the show, I was surprised at how benign this movie appeared to be, with the exception of one scene, which may have been toned down from the book. There a strong hint of romance from a man who does his utmost to avoid any semblance of a loving relationship. In fact, Grey seems to be completely in love with the young woman he meets in a hardware store, who is innocent and beautiful. One senses he is trying hard to please her without false pretences. It also ends on a note that was ambiguous but hopeful. <br/><br/>There are short performances in this movie by a number of actors, including a walk-on appearance by Marcia Gay Hardon, as Grey's seemingly sophisticated and classy mother, and also Max Martini as Taylor, the enigmatic chauffeur, who shares or adopts his boss's serious manner. <br/><br/>A provocative movie that was very well acted and beautifully filmed."

","I haven't read the book and I didn't know much about the movie other than women were going crazy over it. I'm not sure that this will have spoilers, but I thought I would check it just in case. My husband and I decided to watch this movie one night and we actually turned it off about half way through. We've been together for a while so watching stuff like that usually doesn't bother us at all. When a man tells you he's not into what he's watching, even though a lot of people were turned on, I think that tells you everything you need to know about the movie. The acting wasn't terrible, and I'm sure there are people around the world who are like Mr. Grey, but this movie just wasn't for us. It was predictable but weird and I have no desire to watch the rest of it and neither does my husband. A movie about a man who wants to dominate the person he has chosen to be with, under a contract, is just not something I could just sit through a watch."

","""50 Shades of Grey"" is a rehashed storyline taken from the beautifully done film, ""9 1/2 weeks"". I would skip this one and go straight to Micky Rourke and Kim Bassinger in the original version. Every aspect of 9 1/2 weeks is a much richer depiction of the emotional adventure of the S&M lifestyle. The script is much more believable. The scenes are much more varied, artistically crafted and interesting - even fun. And the ending?? While 50 Shades trails off with a whimper, 9 1/2 weeks hits you with a crushingly powerful ending that matches the intensity of the game that is spotlighted in both of these two films. 9 1/2 weeks offers all of this and you get to see why Micky Rourke was known as one of the sexiest men alive."

","First off, I have read the books and when I initially found out that they were going to be made into movies, my first thought was ""how?!?!"". The first book was predominately (I would say 80%) graphically described S&M scenes and honestly contained very little plot, which is why I was surprised they didn't just combine books 1 & 2 together (the second book actually has a plot).<br/><br/>Outside of trying to turn water into wine (create a plot from nothing that is) my biggest issue was Jamie Dornan's acting. Although he has a beautiful face, if you have read the books, he was NOTHING like the character Christian Grey. I felt like the strength and demanding attention that was portrayed in the books just wasn't there. Jamie Dornan's portrayal seemed more like a whiny, annoying, persistent person who Anastasia (played by Dakota Johnson who I thought actually did a decent job) basically gave into because she was tired of being harassed. <br/><br/>I don't know if the first movie completely ruined it for me but if I DO decide to see the second one, I just hope the actors step it up a notch."

When the movie showed up on HBO, I figured ""okay, I'll pour myself a glass of wine and see if the movie is as bad as the books."" Sadly, I convinced my husband to watch with me (he's still not speaking to me). We made it about 30 minutes into the movie when I said ""I give! I can't take it! This is soooo bad! I'd rather watch Family Guy! (btw... I hate Family Guy)"" At this point, my son points out there is a video on YouTube ""50 Shades of Grey in 18 minutes"" or something like that. We cue that up and let me tell you, it was infinitely more pleasurable to watch. At least we were laughing where you are suppose to laugh. Plus, the narrator is much more interesting than Dakota Johnson's ""Anastasia Steele"" or Jamie Dornan's ""Christian Grey"".<br/><br/>If you are looking for a great laugh or maybe a movie to turn into a drinking game, see 50 Shades.

","I have not read the book lets just get that out of the way now, but when a film gets this kind of hype regardless of whether it is positive or not. It is only a matter of time before I watch it and this was no exception. I might not have read the book but I am aware of how poorly written everyone says it is and how ""stupid"" they also say the dialogue is. It is because of this, the first 40 minutes while not exactly brilliant were rather surprising.<br/><br/>For the most part at the start the title characters almost feel like regular people. That is not to say that it wasn't cheesy at times but I did find myself laughing at parts that where likely intended to be funny. Although there was still a sign of what was to come with the famous hardware store scene (seriously a billionaire couldn't afford to get a proxy to do it? or to buy a lot more stuff to make it less obvious?)But when we finally start to get into the parts the book is famous for, that is where as you could imagine it starts to go down hill. From there it gets silly, laughable and while their dialogue doesn't sound as bad as say they it was in the book it still is hard not to find it cringe worthy.<br/><br/>Now I would like to think despite having fairly low expectations of this film I did my best to go in with as open minded as possible. I have seen other films whether they were as famous or lesser known than Fifty Shades of Grey and I had not always received them positively. In fact the 1996 film Crash (not to be confused with the 2004 Oscar winner) still remains one of the worst films of all time. But at least this film was actually not as graphic and still had something of what I could consider to be a obvious plot. I have also seen The Room, what many consider to be the worst film of all time and that was actually worse than this.<br/><br/>But what makes it earn the extra points out of ten for me is the fact that it is well made. Even at its worst everything on screen looked amazing and the score was pretty good. Unlike many poorly rated films on here you could tell they knew what they were doing behind the scenes. And not all of the so called worst films of all time that I have seen could claim that.<br/><br/>But I guess still it is purely for the fans of the book. I know I probably won't be rushing to see Fifty Shades Darker when that comes out that's for sure."

I want her to make her own version of a lot of movies because they can work as the funniest and most idiotic versions. When I first watched this movie, I was convinced this was the worst movie of 2015. However, I now watch it as a comedy and it's the funniest thing you'll watch. The entire film tries to set up that these two are a couple but it's so forced and ridiculous that you can't help but just laugh at it.

I cant remember the exact phrase but there is something that Anna thinks in the book almost every time Mr Grey touches her...same phrase over and over that stands out as extra crud amongst a sea of bad text, anyway this isn't conveyed in the film ....so maybe its actually slightly better - dialogue wise, as we don't have suffer their vacuous internal monologues as in the book (although thinking about it the vacuous performances are on par).<br/><br/>Anyway I read a lot of reviews and blokes going on about this film being depraved and glorifying domestic abuse and how women must be twisted to like this sort of crap. This is over the top and na√Øve imo. The reason the books were so popular and films, bad as they are, will recoup their outlay is simple....<br/><br/>THE BOOKS ARE QUITE SIMPLY A VERY LONG TALE OF A LOT OF WOMENS FANTASY....TURNING / CHANGING A MAN INTO THEIR IDEAL AND PRICE CHARMING. It is not about BDSM or even sex it is about the fantasy of being able to change the cold bad boy into a warm hearted open and emasculated, sorry I mean modern, man. Mr Grey is THE ultimate challenge and Anna succeeds by the end , and even actually by the first few scenes (Grey shares a bed with Anna - a cardinal sin to him). Love will prevail, blah blah blah, he's a lost little boy and needs the love of a good women to show him the light. There is the scene where she says ""i'm falling in love with you"" and he replies dramatically "" no you cant love me""...the subtext is that he is too damaged to love and spoiler alert, as said, guess who fixes him (and by fix I mean turns him into the generic romantic lead and perfect man as stereotyped by modern culture) Its laughable but a common tale synonymous with fairy tales and romances throughout the ages.

That was predominantly the audience. That's OK I guess, but at least try to make it a little entertaining. You're just making people waste their money. I also had a bit of a problem that she was only he one getting beaten. It's the 21st century. It should be a mutual thing, if you like S&M. She should be able to be dominant. Don't send a message to women that is how it should be. I think the guy, although pretty cute is a scoundrel and needs therapy in all reality. Something happened in his psychological development that went askew and he is pulling this poor innocent girl into this neurosis.

","When college senior Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) fills in for her sick roommate, Kate Kavanagh (Eloise Mumford), to interview distinguished businessman Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for their campus newspaper, her life begins to take a drastic turn. Christian as mysterious as he is powerful now finds himself drawn to Anastasia as she is to Christian. Despite being inexperienced, she gets into a relationship with Christian and learns that his true sexual tendencies converge in between pain and pleasure.<br/><br/>I'll be upfront now and say that I've read the first half of the first book of the series, Fifty Shades of Gray. I thought the book was laughably bad and that I read like a softcore porno. With that, my expectations for the film were not very high as I was thinking it would be something like the half of the book I read. To those thinking it would be like the book (I mean the few of you who haven't seen the film yet, more specifically males), it is unfortunately not. By that I mean the subject matter in the film is rather tame compared to how it was depicted in the book. It does have one thing in common with the book, however, it is just as laughably bad. Let me tell you how. The acting in this film, primarily that of the two leads, Johnson and Dornan, was pretty bad. More so for Dornan's Christian Grey. He just seemed out of place in the whole film like maybe he was wrongfully cast. I found his performance wooden and shallow. He had no chemistry with Johnson's Anastasia Steele as I found most of their scenes cringe-worthy. I though Johnson was a little better as her character had more depth but that's not saying much as she is pretty much a doormat to his never-ending advances which really sends a strong message. The thing is you're not watching it to feel empowered, you're (most likely a woman) looking to live vicariously through Anastasia and her sexual exploits. I thought she tried a little more but she and Dornan had the sex appeal of a saugy adult magazine. What I thought really brought this whole thing down was the terrible dialogue with most of it occurring during the majority of the scenes with Johnson and Dornan as it is the primary reason for all the things I previously mentioned. It is so bad that when I saw this in the theater the first time, other people in the theater were laughing at what were supposedly serious moments. Despite everything I've said so far, there were still a few things I liked about this film. I liked the music because it really got me in the mood (pun intended) and I thought it was nicely shot except for the love scenes. In conclusion, I went to see the film the first time because I thought it was going to be bad and I could just laugh at it and for the most part it was and i did. That did not change the second time around.<br/><br/>Score: 5/10 keithlovesmovies.com"

Recently, a friend of mine brought this movie to my attention. It was brand-new and he knew I would be interested. Now, I do not buy new DVDs as they are released. With new titles, I patiently wait till the prices go down to bargain-basement sweeter levels. Meanwhile, I focus on oldies of days gone by, bringing in old favorites, usually at exorbitant prices. Just to let you understand why there is no chance that I'd see this movie anytime soon, for I wouldn't watch anything but my own eventual copy on my large Tedelex EC3409 huger-than-huge screen. <br/><br/>Of course, I went, ""9 1/2 WEEKS for a new generation! Thank you for telling me about this!"" and began monitoring it on my suppliers' sites.<br/><br/>Then I was in an accident. In a wheelchair and unable to walk without a walking frame. It seemed like I couldn't go back to my life as I knew it - access to my house is up a very high back porch. I was faced with the possibility of being permanently institutionalized in the very same place where my friend is a wheelchair-bound resident.<br/><br/>I was there in his room, limping about with the frame, when he showed me a piece of the film. I watched a bit without resisting spoiling my eventual fun because maybe it would never happen. I nevertheless stopped watching very soon, for I just KNEW there and then THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN, I would definitely go back even if I hadda crawl BUT I WOULD GET TO THIS! There could be no backing down. I believed I was going to see it as I would prefer seeing it. One late afternoon, with a pleasant meal in my hands, munching away, watching, enjoying, drinking lots of coffee, the RavenGlamDVDCollector way...<br/><br/>The girl keeps reminding me of Anne Hathaway in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA. That's almost all I can say about the movie, besides the obvious thrill of still awaiting it. I am back at home, recovered, with only a slight, even if bothersome, limp, and the price is not set to go down anytime soon on this set, but I patiently await, and I'm really gonna savor the moment.

In my opinion the trilogy is great; there is romance, dangerous situations and something similar.. The real problem is the movie. Well, they left out many details ex.: they both have blackberry's- NO in the movie he has an iPhone5 and she has an LG ... OK you can't make a movie exactly like it's written in the novel but, they could make it better, and , don't leave out some situations. The actors are OK and I think they invested a lot of effort.

But how long can this go on before her natural instincts for self-respect and independence begin to assert themselves and drive the couple apart?<br/><br/>But don't harbor the illusion that their relationship is just about sex; there are trips in private helicopters, as well as iron-clad, no-disclosure contracts to be signed and prescribed diets to be followed. In short, this is a 24/7 master/servant relationship entered into by two willing partners. In fact, the movie underscores the irony that such dominant/submissive relationships are actually built upon the paradox of freely giving up one's freedom in an effort to be more free. The film also explores how being a part of a mysterious and often misunderstood sexual subgroup requires one to present one face to the outside world and an entirely different one behind closed doors - and the often debilitating effect that such a dual existence can have on a person's emotional and psychological well-being.<br/><br/>Though the critics pretty thoroughly savaged the movie upon its release in early 2015, there are a few things I actually found myself admiring about ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" First, it scrupulously avoids many of the tired clich√©s and tropes normally associated with romantic movies. Second, it isn't afraid to present characters - Christian, in particular - who are often hard to like and identify with, and the movie appears to be content with that fact. Even beyond his fetishism and affinity for kink, Christian comes across as downright weird at times, and the movie doesn't try to soften or ""redeem"" him over the course of the story. The authors make it quite clear that Christian is, at some deep psychological level, a pretty messed up person and that many of his proclivities are the result of the abuse he suffered at the hands of an older woman. I'm not sure this is necessarily fair to the people who comprise this particular sexual subgroup, but, at least as portrayed in the movie, it doesn't come across as all that erotic or appealing an avenue of sexual expression, especially when carried over into the non-sexual realm of their lives as well. In fact, Christian's obsessive need to control Ana becomes positively off-putting at times.<br/><br/>Now onto the movie's defects. One of the weaknesses inherent in adapting a piece of erotica like ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" to the screen is that the simulated sex scenes tend to become more clinical than erotic when visualized on film. Far from tantalizing or arousing us, the sex scenes take on the quality of mere curiosities, with the audience placed in the role of dispassionate observer rather than engaged voyeur. Moreover, to call the movie's pacing glacial would be doing it an injustice. So concerned are writer Kelly Marcel and director Sam Taylor-Johnson with not generating any real excitement or passion that they go overboard in the opposite direction, leaving us checking our watches (or cell phones) instead of becoming fully engaged in what is taking place on screen.<br/><br/>So, in the final analysis, is ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" an endorsement of the S&M lifestyle, or is it more in the nature of a cautionary tale? For the most part, I think it is the latter (I can't speak for the novel, never having read it). After all, as previously stated, Grey is portrayed as pretty much psychologically damaged, and Ana ultimately rejects the arrangement that threatens to turn her into little more that a slave, even if a voluntary one. The feminist ending also seems to hint at the notion that this is probably not the healthiest relationship for the young woman in the long run. The final shot certainly implies that Ana has opted to sever ties with the man who intrigued her initially. I guess we'll just have to wait for the seemingly inevitable sequel to find out for sure."
"josephtome1964","4","0","1","8 August 2015"," Homogenized Deviance
","I've not read the novel on which this film is based. Indeed, in my milieu, I know of no one who read it and liked it. Still, the work sold like hotcakes so I can only presume there are many (single women, most likely, who enjoy at least a little of what they regard as forbidden frisson in their fantasy lives) for whom this rather vanilla sexual adventurism holds an appeal.<br/><br/>The story is nothing unexpected. An attractive young woman named Anastasia Steele, played with a doe-eyed earnestness by Dakota Johnson (whose Hollywood pedigree is nearly royal, since her parents are Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith), on the verge of graduating from college, meets a young but enigmatic billionaire named Christian Gray, convincingly played as a block of wood by Jamie Dornan (which is surprising, since he does a very good job of playing the family man serial killer in the British television series The Fall). I would say sparks fly but that's too generous a characterization for the fading embers that signify the relationship at the heart of this movie. Despite being young and beautiful (Johnson has the appeal of a young librarian or graduate assistant who yearns to be bad, which is to say she's perfectly cast, and Dornan owes a bonus to his personal trainer), these two actors have no chemistry whatsoever! There are rumors they didn't get on during filming but, whatever the case, I can hardly remember seeing a love story (which is, ultimately, what this is) in which the two leads seemed to be so completely wrong for one another. So, for some reason known only to him, Gray develops a major jones for Anastasia, proceeds to woo her in an intense but also creepily unsettling sort of way that, given his wealth, intimidates and ultimately swamps our heroine. He has intimacy issues, though, and reveals he's what many would consider a major freak, with a red-painted room in his space-age bachelor pad that contains a Marquis De Sade starter kit. Then these two crazy kids start dithering over a relationship contract in a negotiation that makes the refinancing of Greek national debt look sexy. Anastasia wants him to let her in and Christian just wants a cocker spaniel in leather wrist cuffs and panties who actually pants for getting flogged. They meet each other's folks (the respective mothers played by the otherwise very fine Jennifer Ehle and Academy Award winner Marcia Gay Harden)and they're no help, so Christian, after confessing some dark truths to a sleeping Anastasia (Dornan's one compelling bit of acting in the film), is persuaded to share his innermost self, which takes the form of him paddling Anastasia as if she just spilled ink all over his spreadsheets. Her bottom still red, she leaves him and we promptly forget all about them until the inevitable sequel.<br/><br/>Within the bounds of this dopiness, Johnson is very good. Though we've no idea why she's still a virgin (particularly when it's made obvious her roommate has a healthy interest in sex) or what she hopes to do for a living once she graduates college, she effectively conveys an intelligent but somewhat naive young woman who finds herself involved in a relationship that is not just overwhelming in several ways but reveals things about herself she never even suspected. When one has an unrealized passion, it's to be expected that the actual first experiences of that passion might leave one bewildered and exhilarated. But how does one react when introduced to practices one never even considered, much less thought one might have a taste for? Amid her growing love for Christian (fetchingly demonstrated when, at one point, she breaks into a goofy dance and, in the best scene of the film, when the two of them glow with delight during a glider flight), Anastasia's initial recoil from his kinks and then her doubt and uncertainty as she gradually accedes to the same, her own surprise at her guarded receptiveness, is compellingly rendered by Johnson. The sight of her lithe naked body, descending into a bathtub or writing under the administration of a cat o' nine tails, is also no drawback.<br/><br/>Dornan, however, calls to mind the critiques of Clint Eastwood's performances in his first years of stardom: a bedpost in Christian's sex den would have had more personality. Despite Christian's monologues, I got no sense of what, if anything, animated him. Even his supposed passion for BDSM seemed detached, hardly a part of him. Dornan's interpretation of this character was almost completely opaque, which I cannot believe he was aiming for. Perhaps he was hamstrung, maybe even embarrassed, by the limitations, the downright silliness, of the material. <br/><br/>Dornan's performance aside, the movie is sunk by flaws of story and screenplay, which is particularly true at the end when Anastasia, once again nagging Christian to reveal himself to her, gets her wish in the form of a whipping and then promptly walks out on him. Make up your mind, honey; either you're into it or not. And if you're not, why did you ask for the whipping in the first place? The direction is competent and the film certainly looks good. The money is up on the screen but the supposedly transgressive nature of the story is really just warmed-over vanilla and, while there are flashes in Johnson's performance of a fresh perspective on such a tale, the penthouse elevator doors close on something Jackie Collins could've written in her sleep."

","I hesitated watching this film, because -after reading the books- I thought I wasn't in the mood to see some porn-like film...But, luckily it wasn't as...graphical as in the books! As a Twilight fan, I found the books AND the movie some like a parody to Twilight...Dangerous man, innocent girl, forbidden relationship, upper-lip bites like Kristen (?!!?), identical lines like ""I can't stay away from you anymore..-Then don't""!...WTF?! EL James probably thought that she could add to Twilight lots and lots of sex and resell it with another name -and a slightly different plot. And if the books were quite entertaining for a summer afternoon, the movie was at most mediocre...I regret to say that Dakota Johnson was either not for this particular role or she's a non-talented actress...Jamie Dornan was the only good thing about this film I'm afraid.

","I had high hopes for this film. I haven't read the books but I love romance stories and stories of awkward courtships. <br/><br/>Unfortunately this movie didn't live up to the hype. Most the reviews on this site are a bit harsh. The bondage and sex aren't what I had a problem with. My problem was with the lack of heat. I just didn't feel that the actors were able to portray the list and heat that was needed for this story. There were many scenes I watched that were just painful. You should be able to feel the heat from the movie. Maybe it was just bad casting or the producer was scared to get too soft core porn on the audience, but it needed more. Especially on Chrstian Greys part. He didn't come across as self assured and confident as he should of. He didn't come across as someone you would forget your inhibitions for. He seemed whiny and juvenile to me. When talking about his experience at 15 he comes across as pitiful. I felt uncomfortable listening. I finished the movie thinking... Okay, that story could have been done justice but instead it was just a miss on the romance and sexual excitement level. For the next one I hope they really work on the romance and steam level. These people are supposed to want each other.. Instead they seem to be able to stand being in the same room. It's uncomoftable."

","Those who prefer boring & mainstream sex/love-making or what's seen in most online porn, most likely will not like this film.<br/><br/>If you're a puritan, or puritan-like, then this movie isn't for you.<br/><br/>The music in the film is appropriate but some of the songs i didn't like.<br/><br/>This film is for a certain niche audience yet it tries too hard to please all-audiences. Hollywood usually targets male teens but this film is best for people who liked the book and/or those who like BDSM.<br/><br/>In terms of romance, this movie or director/producer seems to want to copy the Twilight saga. Produce sequels, & the way they show the main two characters. If you liked the Twilight saga's romance then you'll probably like this movie.<br/><br/>I knew a lot about BDSM before watching this movie.<br/><br/>There's only so much they can show w/o being rated NC-17, be approved by creepy Hollywood, and to be able to reach the mainstream theater. Bdsm is not really porn like many people think. Porn is usually hardcore, quick, fake, and containing explicit content. This film is about a long-romantic story unlike porn.<br/><br/>What i don't like is, it gives a false impression that one must be rich to be able to do BDSM. The two main characters don't have to be of the same skin & hair color (like Twilight & many other Hollywood films.) The female actor who played the female main character looks like she's 14. They make her look very-very-skinny when skinny women generally don't like sex, especially bdsm type sex. Gives the false impression that you must be young & very skinny to be an attractive woman. It gives a bad message that men, especially successful men, should fornicate w/ young & skinny women. She has peach fuzz on her legs! And Mr. Grey is shown w/ bushy-pubic hair?! Bdsm people shave their bush & pubes. And he's shown having weird red things on his chest, Ana asks about em but never gets an answer. Are we gonna find out in the next film? Perhaps a previous woman gave him herpes? And the end message could be that fornication is bad because you can get herpes? It looks like a STD to me. The director is British & it's filmed in Vancouver, Canada (British also). Perhaps that's why us Americans don't like it that much?<br/><br/>The ending seemed like a typical Hollywood ending, no happy ending. Ruins the fun & positiveness of what was going on."

","I have to say being in the bdsm lifestyle for over 8 years. This was a good movie, I really enjoyed it. The only thing that I would like to point out is Grey would be more of a master versus dom. Most subs don't have contracts that is a slave thing. That was the only thing that annoyed me throughout the movie. Other than that it was a really good. I thought the characters had chemistry and I think all of the reactions of Grey's would of been mine as well. I will say the sex scenes were graphic but nothing to harsh. Most of the ""Punishment"" scenes were mild. I think if you are into bdsm or curious about then I think you would like it. <br/><br/>Again if you don't like bdsm don't watch this movie."
"brett-donald","6","0","2","28 May 2015"," A pleasant surprise
","I haven't read the books, and didn't see this film at the cinema, but I am aware of the the hype surrounding both and the debates they raised in the media. Before watching the DVD I read through some user reviews here on IMDb, and was curious to see so many one-star reviews.<br/><br/>I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the film. The heart of the movie is a relationship, a love story, between a troubled, controlling billionaire and an ordinary, romantic young lady. It's certainly not the typical love story you get from Hollywood, and there is plenty of tragedy mixed with it. But I was drawn into the story, and left wanting more. It's only the first part of the story, after all.<br/><br/>The subject matter is difficult, but the story is told with sensitivity and restraint. Some people were complaining that they felt no affinity with Mr Grey, but that is partly the point, he is a damaged person and he is a difficult man to understand and to know. For the audience to feel this, as Anastasia is feeling it, is an intentional and important part of the storytelling. But we do see enough of his inner battle, his fight to change, and Anastasia's fight to reach him, to develop an attachment to the characters. We can hope that he is not damaged beyond repair.<br/><br/>The directing, acting and cinematography were all great. The score is fantastic, tantalising and foreboding at the same time. Yes, there are elements in the plot which are not high on the believability stakes, but that's a criticism you could level at almost any film. It's a unique film that's hard to classify. See it with an open mind (which will be easier if you watch it alone), and you'll be challenged and entertained."

We have two very different characters being attracted to and challenged by someone very different to them, and that's interesting. The facial expressions and nuances of the 2 leads were great, I thought they were both attractive and believable, there were some cute and romantic scenes. The Director did a great job.

The fact he offered a contract was the most idiotic part of the plot. Also the way they wanted to mess with peoples minds in order to make his behavior acceptable by making his character ""be nice"" to her and buy her stuff etc. So ridiculous, overrated and the typical mainstream plot.

","I went into watching this as kind of a joke; definitely not expecting greatness. But after reading all of the bad reviews, I do feel it necessary to say that given the unrealistic and absurd storyline, I don't think the actions and feelings of the characters were that unrealistic. The young girl fell in love with a controlling, power-hungry, sex-craving man who seduced her, and low and behold, things don't pan out the way she wanted. I don't know what's more real than that. I was actually expecting the movie to end with both of them running off into the sunset together, and I was relieved to find that that didn't exactly happen. <br/><br/>Yes, I understand how this can be perceived as degrading to women. But if you're human, you know that once you're wooed by someone as attractive (both physically and materialistically), as this Christian Grey guy, well, you're bound to do some stupid things. Let's be real. <br/><br/>As for the sex scenes; yeah, it's soft porn. But I bought it. Maybe because that kind of ""fetishism"" is so foreign to me, I was intrigued. Once you understand that this whole story was created via someone's sexual fantasy in the first place, it's not so hard to take. <br/><br/>I thought Dakota Johnson was really good. Am I the only one? Given what she was given, I think it's safe to say she did the best any actress could with it. Give the girl some credit!

","just watched the long anticipated movie & i thought i had to share my thoughts on it. well, first of all i have to admit i didn't read the books so this blog cannot be a comparison between the book and the movie. there was much anticipation since there was some 'hot topic' in the book series. my opinion about it is that OF COURSE you cannot expect to see some 'hard scenes' in the movie -it is not a porn movie- so you have to look it more on the story side. the story is in my opinion a kind of impossible love story, like the one in titanic, like the one in the twilight series. its about a man who had a difficult childhood, which in many forms defines the character he has as grown up man. on the other side you have a literature student who is rather shy but falls for a man who is also a gentleman. he has more difficulties in changing himself, she tries to partly change herself for him, but mostly she has the very complicated task of changing this 'dark side' of him. most of the movie is about mr grey wanting ms steele to sign this kind of 'contract', you never know what will happen and for that its a movie that -even though it slows down in some parts- it remains exciting to follow until its end. on the actor side you have a (in my opinion) brilliant dakota johnson who perfectly plays her character in a rather dramatic way and a rather serious jamie dornan who you cannot say is acting badly as Christian grey. all in all a movie that is worth watching, not because of the hype that was surrounded, but because its a movie that needs deeper understanding. i cant wait to see what the next movies of this series will bring. maybe then i'll post another review. stay tuned."

The books themselves are horrendous and horribly written - no literary prizes to be won. If you've read several books in the same genre it's like she has taken similar elements or story lines and put it in hers. So, she's very lucky that her books got so famous and made into movies. There are a lot of better books in the similar genre that are a ton better. Kudos at least for making the movie better."

","I know that usually, when you've first read the book, that the characters in the movie don't always add up to what you've already envisaged in your head. So, when I first started watching this movie, I tried to approach it with an open mind. <br/><br/>Even so, the characters on screen were difficult to come to terms with, mainly because Christian Grey comes across as neither 'hot' or 'intriguing', though he certainly has an element of cold mastery about him. Anastasia does have many of the elements required for a virginal girl who becomes seduced by the dark side of sex, but is she really beautiful enough to have engaged the attention of Mr Grey? I didn't think so. <br/><br/>What saves the movie is the direction which is sympathetically in tune with the original story even though the screenplay has to chop out much of the story's development because of lack of time. Anastasia's apparent 'plight' comes across well, and is superbly acted, even though I did feel that much of the tension implicit in their burgeoning love affair is short-circuited as a result of the restrictions of film time. Even the sex scenes lack tension - while eroticism is at a low ebb, perhaps because the backing music is both unnecessary and so intrusive as to cover up the actor's vocalizations of pleasure. <br/><br/>I suppose the real trouble is that most viewers of this film will be hoping for a visual representation of the book and, because of the severe cuts (I'd love to know what ended up on the cutting room floor) it doesn't match up. Also I doubt that Mr Christian Grey will be anything like they imagined."

","Yes, I totally agree, that this movie could be much better, but I have valued it with 7. Why? I will tell you. If you have not read the book, of course, play of at least one actor (C.gREy in my opinion) is quite bad. But as I have read the book, it seems to me very good. In fact, it is not the bad play, it is just the way this person is, from the book, I mean. It could be better, of course, but I wouldn't rate it so low anyways. One bad thing is, that it seems so suspended for me, because i know all, what has been happening between these scenes, from the book, and plenty of inf is missing, so you cant really understand everything, if you have not read it. And I am not talking about sex scenes, I mean relationship between them, and all the history and characteristics, its a lot more deeper, that you can think. Everyone should try to look deeper. Its not just about sex and submission and hot scenes. I know, that many girls have been waiting this movie, and are feeling disappointed, but it only means, that you have been going through the surface, not the meaning. My opinion though. Was smiling a lot, and felt happiness and sour with them both, even realizing its just a movie. Hope someone felt something like that too."

","Fifty shades of Grey<br/><br/>""Fifty shades of Grey"" is a drama from 2015 which I watched without high expectations. Not a good movie, but after all the bad stories, it might have been worse. The leading roles are fulfilled by Dakota Johnson -you might have seen her before in ""21 Jump Street""- and Jamie Dornan. A very unknown cast, for a book that is known worldwide. Director Sam Taylor Johnson could have done a lot better than this.<br/><br/>The story tells of a young woman who falls for a young, rich and spoiled man, stating he cannot love, and therefore he fulfills his needs with sex games. Dakota overacts in my opinion. Jamie is a feast for the eyes and the story in itself is not bad. I surprised myself by being pulled into the story at times. I have never seen a film like this before, but what I found very disappointing is the ending. It was so very abruptly, and a cliffhanger clich√©. A negative judgment from me."

The movie has no back story but i guess that is why they are making it just like the books and there will be more movies to explain there back story (hopefully). Due to the sex scenes they weren't bad at all. Most of it just involved showing what type of objects he uses and what he is into. The whole ending was weird to me but like i said if it follows the books the ending will continue into another movie. I guess if you have enjoyed the book you probably wont enjoy the movie.

The movie fell short of the book for: scene changes and lack of significant scenes, and dialogue changes when unnecessary. Because of these, I felt like Christian's unique strong character was watered down, and does not give viewers who did not read the book, a real idea of who he is. The beginning and ending, does follow the book. I do feel that a different screen writer with more book- to- film adaptation experience would be better for the second and third films."

","Firstly i'd like to address that i am a Female that has read all three of the books & have been eagerly awaiting the release of this film - unsurprisingly i'm left disappointed with it. <br/><br/>My biggest gripe with this film was the god awful casting, Jamie (bless his heart) was a terrible match for Christian Grey & Dakota really didn't have the face or personality i expected Anastasia to have. He wasn't a ruggedly handsome man that made me want to weep with joy whenever i saw his face & she wasn't the strikingly beautiful woman that the book described. <br/><br/>I think it's fair to say that there was zero chemistry between both Jamie & Dakota which made the acting and ""romantic"" scenes feel a bit awkward (almost like they couldn't wait for it all to be over so they could cash their pay slips in) - neither of them are terrible actors but the film could have been a lot better with different people. <br/><br/>The book wasn't great so you can't really expect much from the script itself, which is literally word for word with what was written in the book. I felt some scenes were missed which lost the overall feel that the book had & it also felt a bit rushed (they'd met and were in bed within what felt like 15 minutes of knowing each other). <br/><br/>The scenery/directing was probably the greatest thing about this film.<br/><br/>Overall i'd rate this 5 because it's not shockingly terrible but it's also not a film you'd shout about from the roof tops so i feel a 5's only fair, right? <br/><br/>If you've read the books like me and want to put a face to the names then i'd definitely suggest watching this, if you're a hardcore film snob then avoid at all costs purely for your own sanity and peace of mind. <br/><br/>Easy going, typical (minus the BDSM) romantic film for women (& men if desired) to watch with a bottle of wine - don't take the film too seriously because you'll never enjoy it otherwise!"

It completely ruins the continuity of the film and clearly show where they edited it to get an R rating for a film that in all likelihood would have earned the infamous NC-17 or worse, due primarily to the graphic sexual theme of the story.

","Having set the world alight with tittering, E. L. James' trilogy of erotic books gets its first screen adaptation from writer Kelly Marcel, under the direction of Sam Taylor-Johnson (please no snickering at Johnson, we're barely into the intro!). The inevitable raucous reception which the film has received, though, has been far from fiery, and rightfully so. 50 Shades Of Grey the film seems like lukewarm, awkward foreplay after a much-anticipated build-up of sexual innuendo and teasing. <br/><br/>Dakota Johnson (again, no snickering!) plays the main character of Anastasia Steele, who may sound like a Russian stripper, but is actually a frigid virgin who seems completely unenlightened about the adult world, spending most of her time in books. She meets a mysterious millionaire after interviewing him for her college newspaper, and is introduced to a whole new world. And NOT an Aladdin style ""whole new world""¬Ö<br/><br/>Jamie Dornan plays the aforementioned millionaire, Christian Grey, a successful businessman with nice suits, fancy cars, and a private helicopter. Sauv√© and sophisticated, he seems like every woman's wet dream. His dark and brooding character, though, hides a sexy secret (although, not much of a secret to anyone watching the film) - he likes it dirty. <br/><br/>Not your usual boy-meets-girl story, 50 Shades Of Grey plunders into a treasure chest of other clich√©s which render both of these characters limp. First off, the idea that women are attracted to asshole men as long as they are rich. Secondly, that men will obsess over something they can't have, and when they finally get it they treat it like crap. And thirdly, sexual exploration is the only true meaning of life, except when love gets involved. <br/><br/>Taylor-Johnson's film plays out like a sordid perfume advert where the fragrance they are flogging is called ""restraint"". No one seems happy to be in this film, and where the storyline promised both a love story and some BDSM, it half-delivered on both for an uncomfortable blend of anticipation and failure. Christian Grey comes out looking like a depressed psycho, using his money and business acumen to act out his seediest fantasies whilst fixating on a woman he hopes to abuse into next week, all without a smile.<br/><br/>It seems the movie tried to stay too true to the books, whilst forgetting it was an ADAPTATION that needed blow the books out of the water. The only way to have competed with the success of E. L. James' trilogy was to, excuse me, go much deeper. Instead, what should have been a slap round the face with a nine-inch sex toy, turns into a meek tickle with a feather that irritates rather than tantalizes."
"onehigginsdavid","5","0","2","25 February 2015"," Not for Me
","I guess this Movie wasn't really made for an old man like me. I have to assume it was meant to appeal to someone like the Protagonist - a shy young woman. S&M has never attracted me either except out of curiosity. However, as this has become such a cultural phenomenon I thought I would see the movie. This Genre, as well as the fetish of S&M is all about building and maintaining 'Tension' - and anticipation. I did not read the book; but I have to assume that it at least provided a guide and template by which the Movie could be constructed and you could see the authors skills in the plot of the Movie which wasn't bad. I liked the character development, especially of Christian Grey. We are introduced to his inner self by how he attends to the minute details of his external appearance - like his drawer with ties that reflect the Movie's title. The greatest fault I found with the movie - for me anyway - was the actor that played 'Mr. Gray' - Jamie Dornan. I don't know what the Make-Up people did to him, but he looked about ten years younger than he did when I saw him of TV's 'Once Upon a Time' - which means about 15. Maybe that appeals to the young girls this Movie targets - but I thought it made him Ridiculous and spoiled the whole thing for me. Equally disappointing for me was the performance of Dakota Johnson. When I saw the movie I thought perhaps she had just been poorly directed; but after seeing her on Saturday Night Live I realized she is just a very bad actress."

","As a guy when asked if I wanted to see the new 50 Shades of Grey film (or told that I was going) I was nothing short of sceptical. I am very comfortably straight bloke and like to think I have a good sex life so, really I was just going in the hope that I got lucky that night. I was sceptical however. The thought of, and I'm not aiming to stereotype here but .... all of the middle-age women trying desperately to get their kicks from Mr Jamie Dornan whipping a virgin until she cries, to be honest...... you can see my concerns! Regardless of this I took the time out of my Saturday to witness it for myself. <br/><br/>The verdict? Surprising, actually, And not all bad. Apart from some very cringe worthy spanking over the knee and smelling of not so fresh knickers; there was actually a pretty solid story. Now I know that it is technically already a story, being born as a book and all, but from my very brief encounter with the books I can safely say they are garbage. Hence why I feel so strongly that Sam Taylor Johnson has done such a good job at creating this movie, well along with Dakota Johnson's smoking hot body which makes the whole experience a little more bearable. All in all as a guy I didn't once feel emasculated or out of place just a little jealous of his Audi R8 and stunning Seattle apartment. I must say though as a billionaire, he has nothing on Bruce Wayne! I can guarantee you once think when you come out of that theatre you will wish you were a slightly darker shade of grey........<br/><br/>Mr K The club"
"theSachaHall","5","0","1","22 February 2015"," A Prematurely Ejaculated Golden Opportunity
","Jamie Dornan's Christian Grey summarised Fifty Shades better than I ever could when he snarled on screen that he's 'Fifty shades of f**ked up!' Damn right Jamie ‚Äì although I was thinking more along the lines of the film's 'Fifty shades of f**king boring'. Yeah, folks. It's disappointingly underwhelming although, it's not all doom and gloom thanks to the injection of a little humour - but I'll get to that in a minute.<br/><br/>It also makes you wonder to what extent and in what ways did the 'logger-heading' between Fifty Shades of Grey author E. L. James and the film's entire entourage (everyone from the production house to screenwriter Kelly Marcel and director Sam Taylor-Johnson), affect the final outcome of certain scenes and to the film as a whole. For example, if you pay close attention to the film's dialogue, you'll quickly notice that there's two diametrically opposing writing styles that effect a kind of discordant rhythm. <br/><br/>James and Taylor-Johnson have readily admitted to contentions on-set particularly, in regards to the sex scenes. If truth be told, I'm really curious to know who was responsible for those insipidly lackluster scenes because if that's their idea of kink¬Ö their vanilla must be rigidly puritanical! Plus, it's an impressive feat to have single-handedly pre-ejaculated all the semi-curious sexuals back out of that luxuriously enticing Red Room and right back in to their pulpy vanilla playpens.<br/><br/>Despite saying all this, Taylor-Johnson's caning scene just inside the entry of David Wasco's super-luxurious Red Room is deliciously titillating and beautifully crafted. It epitomises the ethos that the submissive (even whilst naked and in the waiting position) controls the power ‚Äì to wield and submit ‚Äì within the dynamic of their BDSM relationship. Likewise, the suspended hanky-spanky scene with the riding crop is also nicely executed, though I wish artist Taylor-Johnson had gone one step further and used the film as an opportunity to introduce viewers to the intricately beautiful art of Shibari.<br/><br/>Taylor-Johnson's sleek and elegant adaption of E. L. James' 'holy craptastic' Harlequinesque porn-oh-story Fifty Shades of Grey follows the sexual awakening of English-literature ing√©nue Anastasia 'Ana' Steele (Dakota Johnson). As a favour to her sick roommate Kate (played by Eloise Mumford), Ana agrees to cover an interview with billionaire entrepreneur and University benefactor Christian Grey for their college newspaper. On entering Grey's austere office, Ana and Christian are immediately intrigued by the other: she, by his punctilious aloofness and he, by her unaffected innocence and youthful beauty. Ana wants romance and a loving relationship; Christian wants her¬Ö to f**k. But only with a contract of course.<br/><br/>Intrigue soon turns to infatuation as Grey creates right-place-right-time encounters with Ana such as bumping into her at the hardware store where she works. The ensuing t√™te-√†- t√™te cleverly crafted by Marcel, is playfully humorous and witty as wide-eyed Ana helps Christian locate cable ties, duct tape and lengths of rope. 'You're the complete serial killer,' Ana quips to Christian, a reference that also alludes to Dornan's previous role as a stalking serial killer in the BBC's The Fall.<br/><br/>Following unannounced visits at Ana's home, her work and her mother's home in Florida, their mutual obsession culminates in Christian whisking Ana away for the weekend in his helicopter to his Seattle apartment. Ana's anticipation of a 'romantic' weekend turns to intellectual curiosity when Christian reveals his singular proclivities, before asking the sexually inexperienced Ana if she would agree (contractually), to become his submissive followed closely by a showing of his play room.<br/><br/>Johnson is magnetic as the quietly confident and not so naive virgin who contemplates letting go of traditional conventions to explore her sexuality. You can't help but follow every fluid (and awkward) movement she males on screen and be entranced by the way she manages to conveys every new experience and psyche layer so openly. She also succeeds in embracing the absurdity of the text and her butt-plugging control freak by playing the player with tongue-in-cheek barbs and quick-as-a-whip deliveries. The contract negotiation scene is particularly entertaining. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Dornan the poor soul is a cardboard cutout up sh*t creek without a paddle. There's nowhere he could go with his two-dimensional, all brawn / no brain character no matter how hard he tried to humanise the body-bot. And with Razzie worthy lines like 'I f**k¬Öhard', 'Me' and 'I'm fifty shades of f**ked up', I'm impressed Dornan managed to remain so stoic and not inadvertently introduce water sports to the BDSM table.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, FIFTY SHADES OF GREY is an intricately carved chessboard in need of a Grand Master. It's well directed, decadently constructed, and exquisitely shot, not to mention built around a tantalising premise that explores an erotic practice very few people truly understand or practice. The film also addresses unhinging traditional norms and personal sexploration. Unfortunately, the script fails to capitalise on its golden opportunity to demystify and educate the masses about BDSM. And let's not mention (again) that the inchoate script exposes the discord within the script writing department.<br/><br/>Perhaps they should have watched Disney's FROZEN beforehand. That way they would have known to let it go, let it go and preferably to a Bergman-esque art house in France, Sweden or Poland."
"maurice_yacowar","7","0","2","16 February 2015"," Young woman resists lover's rough sex
","i'll take two approaches to 50 Shades of Grey.<br/><br/>(i) The story<br/><br/>Not having read the book, I can only describe the film as a feminist caricature of male dominance, in business, social conventions and especially sex. Here is male power extensio ad nauseum. <br/><br/>Women embrace the story because it's pure fantasy. Christian Grey (what a safe name for a guy who works in the ambiguous netherworld) is a dream lover. Played by a rippling underwear model, he's a handsome single billionaire who runs a high powered network of investment, development and charity. He plays classical piano, flies and glides, is equally accomplished at literary references and jogging, has cars, closets and apartments to die for ‚Äî and he's not gay. The twist is that he's not Cary Grant but a practitioner of the current trend, rough sex. His playroom does not come from Home Hardware. I think.<br/><br/>Anastasia Steele (i.e., a deposable princess with a hard core to resist his hardcore designs) literally falls for him when she first enters his office. She wants sex, love and romance, the latter two of which his life scars prevent him giving her. She is pretty, slender, a virgin, but is ultimately reluctant to accept the flogging and punishment his alternative to love-making requires. She will follow him into his world but wants the right to say when to stop. After submitting to so much, Anastasia eventually takes back her power.<br/><br/>Christian was originally seduced into being a submissive. There he discovered the joys of being controlled, freedom from having to make decisions or determine his will. Now he contends he will offer Anastasia that liberty, as if it wasn't for primarily his satisfaction. He sets the firm terms of their relationship ‚Äî in a legal contract, no less ‚Äî that protects him from her desires, like their sleeping together, going out on dates or being affectionate. He will run the whole show. So like a guy, he still has the nerve to blame her for attracting, weakening and changing him. It is to laugh.<br/><br/>The film ends like the scene of their first meeting: the elevator closes separating them as they say each other's name. Expect a sequel. Or two. Increasingly shadier if not Greyer.<br/><br/>(ii) The style<br/><br/>The film is directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, who as Sam Taylor-Wood was one of the brilliant young visual artists in Britain. She won the most promising artist award at the 1997 Venice Biennale and placed second to Chris Offili for the 1998 Turner Prize. Her art photography background sets the film's visual style: glossy shallow opulence. Scene after scene gleams like a Vogue layout. Everything is expensive, classy ‚Äî and cold. So are the characters. Both leads' mothers seem all plastic face, the adoptive fathers impotent jokers. <br/><br/>Though bondage has for some time been a suggestive staple in the glossy fashion mags, there's a piquant tension here between the flashy layouts and the flayed flesh beneath. To preserve an R rating (and box office), however, the sex scenes are still softcore, apparently a sellout from the extremities that gave the novel its sting. We see the Steele naughty bits a lot but nothing of the lower Grey front. <br/><br/>This work clearly grows out of Taylor-Wood's previous films. Her 2002 commissioned portrait of David Beckham for the National Portrait Gallery was a film that watched the beautiful man sleeping. He was at once the subject of the film and the object of the world's gaze ‚Äî for once the woman's gaze not just the male. Her Nowhere Boy (2008) examined the early years of the young, sensitive, abused lad who became John Lennon. Her Crying Men recorded a number of famous men crying, including Lawrence Fishbourne, Paul Newman, Sean Penn and Robin Williams, familiar men in an unfamiliar openness. Like into what that bully Anastasia is trying to convert our poor Christian."

","I went to see this having read all the books years ago. From the very first scene as everyone else had said the acting does feel very staggered and rigid. I did stay the length of the movie and although the acting didn't get any better I understood what the producers we're possibly trying to achieve with the movie itself.<br/><br/>To begin with, if you've read the books do not go into the movie with expectations on what its going to be like as it will not meet those expectations. The movie is more suited for someone who hasn't read the books and knows nothing about Christian Grey. As I had read the books I expected the building of the characters to be similar and the relationship to be more drawn out. It's not and this is definitely disappointing. What I did realise is they only have one and a half hours to make it work so had to leave out what I believe are crucial relationship building points. The other thing which I thought was dull was the scripting as this is exactly out of the book. If you have read the books, inevitably you will compare the movie to the book and sadly will be let down. <br/><br/>Jamie Dornan, I feel does a pretty reasonable job at Christian however if you've seen him in crime series The Fall you may get a chuckle out of certain scenes like seeing him jogging. Dakota on the other hand, sadly let's the film down. I don't believe her skills were good enough to convey the chemistry felt between the two and subsequently there were a lot of awkward eye contact scenes like the final moments of Days of Our Lives or the Young and the Restless. She had the look, yes, but not the sexiness or sophistication of the book version Anastasia.<br/><br/>Of course there are lots of nude scenes however its just boobs and bottom occasionally the slight glimpse of something lower. But that's it. The sex scenes are by no means over the top nor do they look controversial or promote violence against women. It's just more toys and fetishes.<br/><br/>Finally the way the movie ends leaves much to be desired. Obviously they are going for making all four books into movies as the ending just leaves you hanging. <br/><br/>All in all its a good attempt to replicate a book however stops short due to Dakota's innocence and the fact that in the 1.5hr time frame you just can't get ask the crucial plot points covered.

","I love Fifty Shades of Grey not because I embrace mediocrity but mainly because, I find it unique and very entertaining (I don't mean to offend anybody). <br/><br/>I actually read all three books and I was really waiting for the release of the first movie but sad to say, I was quite disappointed when I watched it on the big screen.<br/><br/>Firstly, I believe that the author of the book, E.L. James was hands-on from the selection of the main actors up to the production of the movie so what went wrong? <br/><br/>I could say that the people behind it did not set a very high standard. There were very few dialogues and the transition of events was vague. If I was a random viewer and had not read the book, I could have had a hard time following through and eventually, would not understand what was going on in the film. It was as if there was no story at all.<br/><br/>Secondly, I am not a fan of Dakota because she doesn't look young enough to be Ana however, her performance was adequate and I guess in keeping with the character of Anastasia Steele. On the other hand, Jamie Dornan was so wrong for the role. His acting sucks. I felt like, all the while he was pretending to be someone and was trying really hard which by the way, did not work. His attempt of being dominant and sexy was a total failure. He looked stupid.<br/><br/>Lastly, why was it rated R? Well, I guess because of the nudity but other than that, in my opinion, the sex scenes did not went overboard. They weren't thrilling or exciting. <br/><br/>Overall, I could say that the movie did not give justice to the book. It didn't meet my expectation being a fan of Fifty Shades and so I am rating it 5 out of 10 just to make me feel good because apparently, my heart was broken when I watched it. <br/><br/>P.S. Please make the next ones better, way better than this."

","**may contain spoilers***<br/><br/>Yes, the writing was elementary, but I think the biggest issue with the movie is that the beginning is so rushed viewers (especially those that did not read the books) just don't understand why this man is so interested in this girl to begin with! The initial interview, coffee meeting, and drunken morning after were so much more involved in the book and that was were the readers begin to care about the connection between these two. The writers of the screenplay did not capture the tit-for- tat banter that was present in the book during the first few initial encounters of Anastasia and Christian and the whole start of the film felt like it was a rush to get to the bondage. And by doing so, the writer and director lost the very essence of their ""romance"" and viewers just are not connected to the characters. Dakota did a good job as Ana, but Jamie's version of Christian came off as nerdy intellectual instead of arrogant control freak. I hope that for the sequel they bring in a new writer and director. Just don't try to take the film too seriously."
"mariana-dineva14","6","0","2","18 February 2015"," The Story Line is just not that Amazing
","Some people have written that ""the acting was as if in a porn movie"". I don't share the opinion - the acting and actors were good. The story line is not that interesting and and writing - often laughable. I have read many books from that life style and don't get how that series in particular is a multi- million bestseller. This movie reminds me greatly of ""Twilight"" (not in a good way), just in BDSM. She is just so (I cannot even find that word) ""uneducated"" - time whole time Christian was courting her, she couldn't even muster the courage to research, the practices she obliviously did not know anything about. Through the whole movie (and probably book) everything was pretty tame but then she challenged him to do his worst - and got whipped, literally, which was still probably not his worst considering there were canes in sight. I have started reading the book but am not sure if I can actually read the whole thing. Considering the bad writing, the movie was good."
"austeja8","5","0","2","18 February 2015"," You either like this movie or you don't
","The reason I gave 5 is purely because of the effort to the cast to make this movie. I have read all 3 books of 50 shades trilogy and after watching the first movie I am feeling a little disappointed. I was upset that the movie cut out some scenes from the book.<br/><br/>Also, to be honest despite 50 shades of Grey being a movie and not porn I was still expecting a big more nudity rather than just Dakota's tits and ass.<br/><br/>In addition, at the start of the movie I was quiet irritated by Dornan's accent. His Irish roots were very obvious, so it made it a bit weird almost like Christian Grey was Irish. However, I know that he tried to hide his accent as much as he could. I appreciate the effort.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I was missing the chemistry between Anastasia and Christian. At some scenes Dakota was trying too hard to build the chemistry while Christian was very laid back. I guess I needed more consistency...<br/><br/>To conclude, as I said cast did tried hard to make this movie. They had a lot of pressure while making this movie to ""please everyone"". They tried. I believe there are so many negative reviews purely because every single person interprets differently the books and the movie."
"3xHCCH","4","0","3","18 February 2015"," Dubious Domination
","""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is a very popular 2011 erotic novel that dealt with a sexual relationship marked by domination and submission. It started as ""Twilight"" fanfiction written by British author E.L. James on her website. It later gained viral status as an e-book, leading to a best-selling print publication and worldwide notoriety as ""mommy porn."" <br/><br/>Now, it had gone one step further and has been brought to life on the silver screen. Of course, controversy continued to hound this film production, starting from the casting choices for the lead roles, which were never popular with the fans. Locally there was a lot of talk about censorship with ""blurs and blocks"", despite the fact that it had already been rated R-18. (While in France, I saw that this film had been incredibly rated as R-12.) <br/><br/>Of course, all this media hullabaloo resulted in more audience curiosity. Despite scathingly bad reviews when it opened on Valentine's Day, this film pulled in a startling box-office haul of $95M in its first weekend alone. Against my better judgement, I simply had to see what the fuss was all about.<br/><br/>Anastasia Steele is a college student majoring in English Literature. When she met young business tycoon Christian Grey, she was attracted to his strength of character and the mystery of his person. Mr. Grey, likewise taken by Ana's charm and innocence, pursued her with gifts, from first editions of Thomas Hardy novels to rides on the company helicopter. <br/><br/>However, when the virginal Ana was falling in love with Grey, she would discover that he was not into the traditional romantic affair she was expecting. His ""thing"" was sexual domination and submission, as proved by the array of whips, chains and cuffs he had in his ""playroom."" Will Ana willingly submit to this man's perverse idea of a relationship?<br/><br/>The topic of sexual domination and submission in itself is not palatable to most tastes, including mine. To be fair, the film had been careful in showing that there was consent as far as Ana's concerned when it came to sexual activities. The screenplay is based on the book, so the shortcomings of the book are the same shortcomings of the film, when it comes to cheesy situations and lines. <br/><br/>As far the sex scenes were concerned, this film paled in comparison with ""Basic Instinct"" or ""9 1/2 Weeks"" when it comes to erotic danger and urgency. To add further damper, the ""blocks"" the local distributors employed to protect the eyes Filipino audience from prurience were so ugly. Sometimes these black blocks would occupy an entire half of the wide screen! Anyway, these unsightly ""blocks"" aside, I think the boring depiction of sex in this film was because the actors playing Ana and Christian did not have any chemistry between them. <br/><br/>I thought Jamie Dornan was woefully miscast as Christian Grey. Physically, he was not tall and imposing enough. Attitudinally, he did not look dominant or confident enough. In fact, he looked awkward in a lot of scenes. He did not look like he was having any pleasure at all with what he was doing. Stripped down to basics, this main conflict of this film was Christian fighting the romantic love he was feeling for Ana in order to fulfill his domination fetish. Dornan could not effectively get this across. With all the staring that Grey had to do, I also get distracted with Dornan's right eye, which bulged bigger than the left.<br/><br/>In contrast, Dakota Johnson (daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) was able to convey the conflicts in her character quite well, I thought. She was in love and at the same time intimidated by Grey. She had more nude scenes than Dornan, which was ironic for a film targeted for a female audience. I guess this was done for the benefit of the husbands and boyfriends who will be ""forced"" by their wives and girlfriends to watch this with them. She did show acting talent here, so I hope doing this film will not stagnate her career.<br/><br/>With its slick-looking production design and a killer pop soundtrack, this film is not the total bore it was made out to be. Ironically for a major Valentine release however, the relationship we see in this film is romance-less, thrill-less and loveless. Even if audiences knew what the film was going to be about when they go in to watch this, many will still be repelled, disturbed or disgusted by the aberrant and abusive sexual behavior they see on screen."
"printzr","5","0","3","17 February 2015"," The only thing that interested me was the crate & barrel model room
","I almost fell asleep because the movie was boring. The girls giggling behind me annoyed me but that wasn't the main problem. Throughout the film, the main characters showed little to no chemistry. In a film like this, where passion and lust are the main themes, it is crucial that the characters project tension and desire. However, Dakota Johnson acted worse than Kristen Stewart from Twilight. As such, without seeing any of their genuine emotion, their dialogue fell flat.<br/><br/>Jamie Dornan, on the other hand, fit his role better. His acting showed an internal struggle in his character, but was limited towards the end. <br/><br/>All in all, 50 shades of grey could have been a lot better."
"cho_chang_ph","6","0","2","16 February 2015"," A Mixture of ""Okay"" and ""Not Okay""
","I was very excited when I first saw the trailer until I tried to read the books. So when I read the books and I expect that it would be more racy in the movie. But when I saw the movie, it turns out that it is kind of ""there"". <br/><br/>Curiosity really played me well when I first read the book until I read it several times. E.L. James did put the thought on the books that would delight the readers. It's pretty erotic but the thought of the story comes to one thing - love. <br/><br/>Then when the trailers and TV Spots showed up, I just knew that it would be the mixture of the book and the director's vision. Until I watched the movie for the first time, it was just as I predicted. Sam Taylor-Johnson did bravely direct this film with trust. The actors, particularly Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, delivered their best to portray the main characters of the book, and it was not easy and funny to shoot those racy sex scenes all the time. <br/><br/>Okay for me - the actors, the directing, the location (I really like the Red Room of Pain though), the glider, and 50% of the story. <br/><br/>Not okay for me - the soundtrack (I expect a lot of the soundtrack entirely based from the book), the other 50% of the story, the script (I think it needs some push related from the book), and costume. <br/><br/>My only opinion is that I do respect the author's intention to put the book into a movie, but I also do respect the director's vision to execute not just based from the book but also its artistry. So it is better to have an open mind and not be too judgmental about the movie."
"stevendbeard","6","0","2","16 February 2015"," BDSM For Dummies
","I saw ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", starring Dakota Johnson-Need For Speed, 21 Jump Street_2012-FYI: she is the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith; Jamie Dornan-The Fall_tv, Once Upon a Time_tv; Marcia Gay Harden-Into the Wild, Bad News Bears_2005 and Jennifer Ehle-Zero Dark Thirty, The King's Speech.<br/><br/>This is based on the book trilogy that is written by E.L. James, and no, I have not read the books. It is an ""R"" rated erotic movie that is based on an ""NC-17"" book about BDSM-if you do not know what those initials stand for, then you have probably not read the books, either. The director wanted to make the film ""NC-17"" but the studios wanted a lower ""R"" ratting to get more bodies into the seats of the theaters. Dakota plays an English college major that gets roped into doing an interview for her ailing roommate. Jamie plays the billionaire being interviewed and he has a rather kinky hobby; he is into BDSM-FYI: the first time this hobby is actually shown being engaged in, is around 45 minutes into the film. Once Dakota is introduced into the red room-that is his play room-she discovers more about sex than she had ever known-before meeting Jamie, she was a virgin. Jamie even has a contract that spells out all of his rules, some of which state that he does not sleep in the bed with her, after having sex-she has her own room to go to, for sleeping. Everything sexual is consensual, with safe words spelled out in the contract, but he is a control freak that wants things his way, whenever he says so-hence, the contract. The only problem is that Dakota wants to have a normal relationship-go to dinner or a movie-in between the bondage and spankings with her kinky boyfriend but he does not even like her to touch him, when they are not having sex. Now, before you start thinking that this is just a big budget porno movie, the sex scenes of the 2 hour movie only constitute about 15 minutes of the entire movie and his 'equipment' is not ever shown. Marcia plays Jamie's mother and Jennifer plays Dakota's mother. Beyonce' does one of the songs in the movie. The only problem I had was in the abrupt ending-but they could be just setting things up for a sequel, depending on how much this one makes. It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual situations-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 5 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would probably buy it on DVD."
"saviornt","3","0","5","16 February 2015"," Wish it had been better
","Coming from a guy who is into the scene (switch), I will admit that yes, I have read the books. Taken for what they are, a non-realistic approach to the BDSM scene and just a romance novel, they are decent. Not the best, but not the worst I've read.<br/><br/>Now let's move onto the movie. The acting was bad, the chemistry of the actors was bad, and ffs, why did they end the movie when they did? This was a bad decision.<br/><br/>Now, let's move onto the other thing, the subject of the movie: The entire idea that this movie/series promotes abuse to women is ridiculous. If anyone disagrees, well, you're an idiot... want to know why? The entire argument that BDSM promotes violence against women (or domestic abuse - see below), well.. you must not know that there are dominate women, and submissive men? Ever think of that? Derp derp. There is one good thing that came out of this movie, the quote, ""Most of it is in your head"".<br/><br/>You can't have pleasure and pain? There are degrees of pain, yes, and some people are more tolerant than others. However, there is a chemical reaction that happens in your brain when you start mixing the two. Being on the submissive side, the adrenalin and endorphin rush you get out of it is, to put it simply, amazing. The lesson here is to keep an open mind, and to not knock it if you haven't tried it (with someone experienced).<br/><br/>One word of advice to couples that want to try it, don't start with ropes for bonding, especially if you don't know wtf you're doing, as you can seriously injure your partner. Take classes, preferably live ones, go to munches, find people in the scene, etc. One thing that is overlooked as well (even in the scene): Learn first aid. As a precaution, you never know what might go wrong. A knot too tight, a sprain, choking on something (such as wine, like in this POS movie), etc.. Just be safe. Safe, sane, and consensual are the rules in this game.<br/><br/>As far as how it's played out in the movie/series, I agree that he moved too fast, too soon, especially when your partner has no experience in the scene, let alone in sex in general. Christian Grey is NOT a role model for dominates, at all. This was a huge oversight by the author of the books; but again, this was a romance novel, not an actual depiction of BDSM.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good romance movie that involves BDSM, I would recommend Secretary rather than this."
"dane_risinger","6","0","3","16 February 2015"," Awkward Boners and Wet Panties
","I went into the theatre for this move very uninfluenced by outside sources; I had done no prior research of the storyline or plot. My only knowledge of the story was that the books were basically written porn for women to read, which somehow became publicly acceptable. Judging from this I knew that the romantic scenes would be very soft and sensual to please the lady readers who have been waiting anxiously for this movie to be released. Overall, I thought the movie was very predictable with subpar acting and unrealistic sex scenes, however, the frequent exposed breasts was a lovely touch.<br/><br/>The character Christian Grey is the ultimate creep, he is a billionaire that preys on average looking innocent and insecure college girls with daddy issues, and seduces them into becoming his sex slaves. This guy could clearly pull really hard the normal way by impressing women with his helicopter and multitude of Audis. Instead, he shows up at girl's work the day after he meets them to buy rope, tape, and cable ties. And then before he even swipes the V card he wants to make them sign a contract so he can ""fuck (them) into the middle of next week."" Our pledge class came to the conclusion that the character of Anastasia Steele was only a soft seven in this movie. In a real world, a man like Christian Grey would probably be rolling around with a hard nine European super model, or the girl from ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" if he were really lucky. The sex scenes were quite unrealistic in my opinion. In the scene where Anastasia lost her virginity she barely moaned when Christian Grey stuck it in with no hesitation. This simply doesn't happen; she would no doubt be making him take it slow and making plenty of noises along the way. And on top of that she was going in for seconds on the very day she lost her virginity; no way she was ready for another pounding by Christian that soon. Another problem I have is the unnecessarily large amount of pubic hair. I don't know what makes it okay to rock the bush on a 52 foot wide movie theatre screen for all to see.<br/><br/>It makes sense to me how girls could get off to this stuff because it fits the perfect mold of the very average girl hooking up with an attractive wealthy man. Also, girls always want to get with a bad guy and try to fix him, which usually works to no avail. Perfectly epitomized by Anastasia Steele who thinks she is special enough to soften the man who has already run through 15 different sex slaves while still in his 20s. Although we didn't get to see how the relationship ultimately ends up in the first movie, it ended on bad terms when Christian Grey whipped Anastasia Steele after she told him to, then she got mad about it; typical girl. I don't foresee the relationship ever going steady in my opinion, but I'm sure it will in the end just to please the lady readers. I guess I will have to wait for the next movie to find out, which I am no doubt going to see.<br/><br/>Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of the movie but I did admire Christian Grey's lifestyle and belongings, which kept me entertained throughout. I see this movie as an easy way to get a girl in the mood very quickly. So, yes, I would take a date to this movie but only if we had been going steady for a while and there had been mutual romantic gestures between us before. Otherwise, that would be an extremely awkward car ride home. Also, the soundtrack is straight fire, which is my biggest gain from this movie."
"sophgeorges","5","0","3","15 February 2015"," Entertaining, clearly someone's fantasy so don't take it too seriously, not great acting
","I have to say that the storyline at least - followed the books exactly. So thumbs up for following the storyline so well, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Unfortunately due to so much happening in the book I feel the movie was quite rushed and tried to fit in a lot of the 'interesting' scenes all at once and it just became an overdose. I can definitely see how it would seem too much and a bit fake, however I would say in the books (although unrealistic but who cares its meant to be a fantasy) its SLIGHTLY more acceptable.<br/><br/>But for those who have read the books and know the storyline, I think if you can look passed a few cringe moments and perhaps some not-so-great acting bits, this film can be enjoyable. It is definitely not fantastic but it is entertaining in its own way and if you are looking for something extremely girlie and romantic watch it.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say: acting was less than average (could be better), cinematography was OK and the music at some points was nice, the sexual scenes were tasteful and not too crazy, it was entertaining and I would recommend it to people that LOVEEE romantic girlie films or people that love Twilight - its very very similar."
