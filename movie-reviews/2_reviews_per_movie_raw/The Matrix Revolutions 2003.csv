","Let me first say i promise u will love the trilogy if u read this<br/><br/>Here we go with the basics.<br/><br/>Zion is real! The Matrix is not.duh<br/><br/>The Matrix was designed to provide a mental stimulus for the human bodies connected to the machines as a source of power. This is the sixth version of the Matrix. There have been multiple versions of the Matrix because of a flaw in the program (kinda of like Windows). That flaw is giving individuals the ability to choose.<br/><br/>The first Matrix was designed as a perfect Utopia (see pt. I - Smith explains it to Morpheus; pt. II - The Architect explains it again) but humans did not accept it as real so they just kept waking up. It was redesigned to reflect our civilisation at it's last stage before it was taken over by the machines (the year 1999).<br/><br/>The Architect's problem with this new design (the anomaly)of the Matrix is that it require individuals to think freely, i.e. choice. It was the Oracle that suggested he redesign the Matrix in this way. But since humans have choices, so must the programs sent to watch over them, i.e. The Agents, thus bringing us the problem that is Mr. Smith. In Reloaded, The Architect continues to speak of the anomaly he is unable to get rid of, which is why at some point, he feels the only solution is to destroy the Matrix and those who are aware of it (the people of Zion) and start from scratch again.<br/><br/>The Oracle says it clearly in Revolutions. Mr. Smith is the result of the anomaly trying to balance itself. Mr. Smith began to think freely (see part I where he is freaking out while interrogating Morpheous) and the result was a negative one. Realize this, he is a similar program to the One so he is far more dangerous than a normal individual who makes bad decisions. Mr. Smith's virus like behaviour happened in EVERY VERSION OF THE MATRIX. The result would always lead to the same thing -- a system crash if they didn't quickly reboot the system. The same knee jerk reaction you have when you realise someone has sent you a virus.<br/><br/>the one program was created to solve this problem. But each version of the One ultimately failed. Neo is different, in Reloaded he choose the door that led to Trinity, not the door that RESETS the program. Note: The Architect even noticed that Neo's experience in the Matrix was different than all the rest, realising he was the first of them to fall in love.<br/><br/>Onto Revolutions: Neo's choice has changed everything. The system is still threatened by Smith's behaviour, so the Oracle makes a new choice; one she has never done before because no version of the One has ever chosen the difficult path as opposed to easy one of just resetting the system. She allows herself to become merged with Smith in the HOPE that she'll be able to help Neo when the time is right.<br/><br/>Neo makes another unique choice. He goes to the machines and asks for PEACE as opposed to simply destroying the system by going through the opposite door as all other versions of the One did. It was a simple as that to save Zion. Machines don't need very long to process that this may be a better idea than just constantly resetting the system.<br/><br/>At the end, Smith says to Neo the movies tag line - ""Everything that has a beginning has an end,"" as the Oracle is speaking to Neo through Smith. Neo realises it all along, the only way to end this is to sacrifice himself. The Oracle noted that Neo and the Source (the computer mainframe, the Architect they're all one and the same so don't get confused) are connected which is why he can control machines outside the Matrix. He uses this connection to his advantage. He becomes a Mr. Smith and since all the Smith's are connected, the Source now has a lock on Smith and simply deletes him. Pretty simple huh? For those that like to dig deeper, than note the biblical references throughout the series. Heck, the French Man (Merovigchian) is the Devil, just read the elevator button Morpheous presses when he goes to see him for the second time. The Architect represents God - i.e. the creator of the world and its destroyer whenever things don't go as he wants. He even has you to chose a select group of people to restart Zion again sort of like Noah's Ark. Neo is Jesus, the one who realises that peace and love is the answer, not war. And the Oracle represents the Holy Spirit - the consciousness that resides in all of us. It's a deep trilogy if you PAY ATTENTION."

","The Matrix Revolutions (2003) is very underrated trilogy of the mythology to understand. I know for a lot of people is not that good and it is terrible movie to watch. The first time I watch it, I couldn't finish it because I did not understand it and I felt bored with the movie. The second time I kept watching I just enjoyed the movie and I wanted to know more, what will happen next. I think the movie end perfectly the trilogy, tough it did lack on a story and on the action, there very barely in it, that it was in the original and the second movie. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies amd I love this movie to death I don't care what anyone says. <br/><br/>The movie it self's focus more on the humans and the battles against the machines on the planet Zion, more than they are in the phone line of Matrix. I think this was a brilliant end to a brilliant trilogy. If you didn't understand what the matrix was by the end of the film, then you're never going to get it! <br/><br/>Many viewers preferred Revolutions to Reloaded, thinking it was a simpler, more straight-ahead action movie. Though it may have appeared that way, nothing could be further from the truth. Revolutions was a mind-blowing layered ending that honored and respected the plot threads and themes introduced in the first two movies. The character arcs were satisfying and true to the characters introduced in The Matrix. The creators continued to challenge our understanding of the Matrix and its purpose, avoiding the temptation to serve us a bunch of ""their"" answers on a platter. That, to us, would have been a sellout of the vision they've been constructing, and wouldn't have been fair to us. Nor would it have been true to the spirit of the previous movies - they've never told us what things meant, they've only shown us the door. <br/><br/>Everything that has a beginning has an end. In this explosive final chapter of the Matrix trilogy, Neo, Morpheus and Trinity battle to defend Zion, the last real-world city, against the onslaught of the machines that have enslaved the human race. And, now as Neo learns more about his heroic powers--including the ability to see the codes of things and the people, he faces the consequences of the choice made in The Matrix Reloaded. For Neo, that means going where no human has dared - into the heart of Machine City and into a cataclysmic showdown with the exponentially more powerful renegade program Smith. The revolution is now: The Matrix Revolutions.<br/><br/>I wish they made more films about the Matrix. The fighting, story and the conspiracy theories that emerged from these movies created a new world for millions of people out there. Some of the conspiracy theories even created a new ""religion"", the CGI was at the time freaking impressive, the fighting in slow-mo were even more epic and the story itself captured a lot of hearts. Just saying to all who think this movie (and/or the first two) sucked balls,- you are a minority. Movie is great, second one being the best in the trilogy. It is my second favorite film in the trilogy because it ends the story and answers what happened with Neo (Keanu Reeves), he saved Whole planet and defeat Smith (Hugo Weaving) on the end of the movie. This movie may not be the best in storyline, but hell it knows how to make action! That end fight and emotional ending leaving behind a plot for sequel ...Second really expanded the meaning of matrix and the whole idea so I don't understand the hate.<br/><br/>There is a lot of memorable moments the Smith vs Neo climax rain scene is one of my favorite movies scenes of all time. Anyway I love this movie it is not good as the greatest or the best movie or that good, but it is still a worthy sequel to watch and a good end to the trilogy. It is one of my personal Keanue Reeves favorite movies and I love this movie to death. I am giving this 9/10 and only because one of the characters dies in this movie not telling which one."
"MinorityReporter","9","526","771","9 January 2006"," It makes me mad...
","...that this film is not getting the credit it deserves. It is in my opinion one of the most underrated films of all time along with The Matrix Reloaded. Revolutions is undoubtedly different from the previous films both in general and in terms of tone but why is that necessarily a bad thing? I won't be so arrogant as to say that the people who don't like this film are unintelligent. Whether or not people like a film or not is a subjective matter but I can't help feeling that the people who dislike (or even hate) this film are missing something because Revolutions is an intelligent, entertaining, beautiful, sad and moving picture.<br/><br/>The acting of all three films have been a mixed bag and although I usually join in the bashing of Keanu Reeves I find him strangely fitting for the part of Neo. His voice is not the perfect voice due to its monotonous tone but his body language is very good and sometimes even great and that is the case in Revolutions as well. Carrie-Anne Moss plays her character like she did in film two and that is neither particularly good or bad but a decent performance. Laurence Fishbourne's character has been reduced somewhat for the final part of the series but I found that the lines he did have were delivered with conviction and experience. As most people know Gloria Foster died before finishing her scenes for Revolutions and thus a different actress was cast to take over. The choice fell on Mary Alice and while she is no where near as good as Foster she is decent enough. Ian Bliss gets a chance to show his worth in the third film and personally I found his scenes to be among the most interesting of the film and his uncanny imitation of Weaving was spot on. Most of the secondary cast from Reloaded returns in their parts in Revolutions and they all do decent jobs with their characters. Harry J. Lennix (Lock) improved his character tremendously in spite of limited screen time. Hugo Weaving still provides the best acting in the film and steals every one of his regrettably limited number of scenes. He is probably my all time favorite screen bad guy. He manages to show the change in his character remarkably well considering how limited his screen time is. Agent Smith exhibits an increasing amount of human traits including anger, hatred, jealousy and even a sly sense of humor. This change happens to mirror Neo's growing understanding of the machines. Neo and Smith are linked in that way as well.<br/><br/>The effects are of course extraordinary which was to be expected after the stellar effects in the second film. Although there weren't as many scenes inside The Matrix this time around I still found the effects of the ""real"" world to be awe inspiring at the least and the battle for Zion was an incredible display of special effects. Of course the directors never lost sight of the people involved in the battle making it more tense had it only been effects. The climactic battle between Neo and Smith is quite simply stunning. It takes roughly 15 minutes and I for one hardly breathed in those 15 minutes. All three Matrix films have been inspired by Japanese animé comics and that is very visible in the final battle as one can't help but think of Dragonball for instance. The action in that particular scene is frighteningly well done and I got the chills when I watched it in the cinema. Very well done.<br/><br/>The story is darker in this film than in either of the previous films but that is to be expected as the first film was about birth and the second about life. Obviously that means that the third is about the inevitable end that must come to us all: Death. This does that the tone of the film becomes much darker and I felt that was good. This did that the film distanced itself from the previous films in the series and rather than become another rerun the film becomes its own entirely and that is both its weakness and its strength. I think it is its strength as it increases the originality of the film but apparently a lot of people didn't like the interpretation that the third film represents as is clear from the bashing the film has gotten from audiences and critics alike. The film does still have great symbolic value and you can interpret the film in a great number of ways like the previous films. For me this improves the film(s) greatly as you can watch it again and again and still find new things that will renew your interest.<br/><br/>Sadly I cannot make you love this film as much as I do because that would defeat the purpose of the film which is to make people think for themselves. My conclusion about Revolutions is that you will either love or you will hate it but in my opinion Revolutions is almost as good as the first one and one of the best films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>9/10 - On my top 10 of best films."
"MR_Heraclius","6","51","67","24 February 2020"," Another big disappointing sequel to ""The Matrix,""
","Like it's predecessor, the final installment of The Matrix trilogy is overcomplicated in plot, yet even more excessive in CGI. The entire 2nd half of the film is a huge barrage of special effects, and while it's not a huge bore, the brilliant choreography has been sacrificed in it's place; save for the final battle between Mr. Anderson and Mr. Smith, and it's always a pleasure watching the two stars square off. Fun moments aside, it feels overlong like Reloaded and is just as unnecessary."
"lov_nks","9","56","80","24 July 2012"," Good Movie Which Is Underrated
","I'm watching Revolutions this time again in 2012, and now being almost 8-9 years older, i understood and liked the movie which back there in 2003 i felt disappointed.<br/><br/>This movie is much better than the piece of crap movies we get to see nowadays (I mean in the science fiction category). To those who wanted logic and gave bad rating to this movie... i'm sure they did not went to see logic in Avengers and Spiderman. Makes me laugh when people speak of logic in such type of movies.<br/><br/>What a dose of special effects, which were really fantastic, specially the final battle, with $110 million budget it outcast many biggies of nowadays.<br/><br/>I personally believed that those who felt disappointed was because:<br/><br/>1.They wanted to see the normal happy ending. <br/><br/>2. Did not want to see a character die. <br/><br/>3. Wanted to know what happens after the end. <br/><br/>4. They have watched Matrix 1 & 2 too many times and this one came too soon (6 months after reloaded... it should have released 1 year after) <br/><br/>5. They wanted to compare it with Matrix 1 & 2 and did not want this one to be different.<br/><br/>Well... Enjoy the action and special effects and take it as a movie itself and don't compare it with Matrix 1 & 2. Each has its own style."
"bjg213","9","96","147","2 April 2004"," Overall worthwhile, but hard not to feel disappointed
","The first Matrix movie is one of the more ground breaking movies in the last decade as evidence by a pretty massive influence on pop culture. I could immerse myself in this review of just how great I think the first movie is, but I digress. The second was received with so much hype that it couldn't possibly live up to in all fairness, but I thought the second movie was wildly entertaining and a bit like the first one in the fact that it made you think quite a bit after the movie was over (The first one ""blows your mind"" an over-used phrase when it comes to reviewing movies, but it certainly applies in this case).  However, I thought the second had too much action, I believe Keanu has close to 5 fight scenes.  Morpheus has one, Trinity has 2 I think, all this fighting I think cuts out of the plot which is why the the Matrix is cool to begin with.  The action is fun and out of this world at times, but without a good enough plot, a viewer can feel disconnected from the characters in the action.  The plot of the second movie I did enjoy, I just thought more time should have gone into it.  I thought there were many twists and turns and it ends with a decent ""cliffhanger.""<br/><br/>My own problem was that unlike most of the critics I went into the third movie with a lot of expectations, but I knew seeing the first Matrix and the previous Wachowski Brothers movie (Bound from 1996) that this trilogy was going to end a bit differently than a conventional sci-fi film...and it did, but more so in a way that I think a real fan of ""The Matrix"" is still left wanting more, or let me re-phrase, a little more attention to detail.  Revolutions does have bright spots, as much as I love a rock-em, sock-em WELL DONE Kung-Fu in any movie, thankfully that part of the Matrix was cut back.  How many times do I need to see Keanu just entirely beat the tar out of some random machine that never really dies? I like the fact that Jada-Pinkett Smith was at least put to some more use(although it could have been more) in this last film, she adds spark in basically every scene she's in.  The final Neo-Smith fight is awesome. I think the rain alone creates a very cool atmosphere, but a death fight in the rain is certainly something that isn't new to an audience viewing an action movie.  It's still the same basic plot, but I think too much of the plot is revolved around the destruction of Zion.  I think the battle sequence is something around 25 minutes?  That's way too long for a computer generated battle...at least if your movie is barely over 2 hours.  For a 4 hour epic like the 3rd Lord of the Rings for example it works because they've taken so long to develop the characters that the action is more thrilling because you feel so attached.  The supporting characters are barely developed that are fighting in that sequence, The Kid has a back story in the Ani-matrix, but Capt. Mifune or the vast array of other characters that get blown to bits, I have no clue who they are, so what does all that destruction mean to the viewer?  It's a huge display of visual effects that in the end, kind of have a weakened purpose.<br/><br/>
With the Matrix I feel more so attached to the ideas presented rather than specific characters. As much as you gotta dig Mr. Whoa(Keanu) and the ever present bad-ass himself Mr. Fishburne(great in Mystic River by the way), and the under-rated Carrie-Anne Moss, I just don't feel as attached to them as I would to say, well Sam-wise(Sean Astin) from Lord of the Rings. I'm not trying to compare, I'm just offering an example. Also, because it is a little over 2 hours there's no time to get into some of the other cool supporting characters.  Monica Belluci has one stinking line, I mean she's a very talented actress (See the Passion or foreign flick Malena), but hell at least give her a few more to see her in that dress, WOW! Lastly, the overall flow just seems like the Wachowski's didn't know exactly how to end it, not enough time is really given to any of the main or supporting characters, I seem to keep harping on this, but if you are going to end a trilogy you don't have to come to end-all-be-all on everything, but it would be nice to go into more detail than they do.  A scene between Seraph and Neo in the teahouse is so light and generally cool for example, but nothing like this really appears in the third. Like what is this underlying connection between the Frenchman and Seraph for example?  What is that about?<br/><br/>
All in all, the Matrix was a fun ride, interesting early philosophy (the first movie), unbelievable special effects (all three just incredible), and great Kung-Fu, but it just could have ended differently with more depth. So I tried to write this (while being sick at school), but as un-biased as I could for someone who isn't a fan of the trilogy.  Overall rating: 6.5/7.0 out of 10 for the Matrix Revolutions, course if you're a fan, you'll probably dig this way more than that.<br/><br/>P.S. - I seriously hope the Wachowski's don't pull a George Lucas and plan on making a bigillion more of these movies because while I thoroughly enjoyed the Matrix Trilogy, I'm Matrixed Out. No need for Matrix Rebooted, or Regenerated, or Regurgitated, you get the picture."
"Buddy-51","Null","193","308","26 September 2004"," Finding Neo
","'The Matrix Revolutions' is the much-anticipated conclusion to the Wachowski Brothers' cultic sci-fi trilogy, whose previous entries were 'The Matrix' and 'The Matrix Reloaded.' In the series' final installment, the messiah figure, Neo, does battle with the diabolical forces that have imprisoned most of humanity in a world of cyber unreality via a massive computer program known as The Matrix.<br/><br/>Of the three films, 'Revolutions' is definitely the least imaginative and the least interesting. What separated the first two episodes in the series from most other action films was the willingness on the part of the filmmakers to bring some thematic depth and narrative complexity to a genre that, all too often, finds no room for such qualities. The previous two films didn't always succeed in their endeavor - often emerging as more hollow and pretentious than meaningful and profound - but they managed to remain intriguing even in their moments of failure. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for 'Revolutions,' which spends so much time on repetitive action scenes and special effects that there is little time left over for storyline and theme. In a strange way, Neo himself ends up getting lost in this film, dropping off the radar screen for astonishingly long stretches of time, only to re-emerge periodically to remind us that there really is supposed to be a purpose buried somewhere beneath all this ear-splitting commotion (this could be re-titled 'Finding Neo'). The sad fact, though, is that, once we arrive at the climactic scene to which all three films have been building, the resolution turns out to be a ham-handed muddle, utterly lacking in clarity and coherence After an almost six-hour-long buildup over the course of the three films, the audience is left scratching its collective head wondering just what it was that happened before the closing credits started rolling by. Perhaps smarter people than I can figure all this out for, frankly, after the overall disappointment occasioned by this film, I couldn't muster either the desire or the effort to probe very deeply into the matter.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the special effects in this film are spectacular - we would expect nothing less - but what we don't get from 'Revolutions' - which we did from the two previous 'Matrix' films - is that little something extra in the form of intelligence and sophistication that made them more than just the bland, over-produced, assembly-line products they easily could have become - and which 'Revolutions' very nearly is. Even the stolid earnestness of Keanu Reeves can't convince us this time around that there is anything hidden under all those cool gadgets and explosions worth our looking into. <br/><br/>Thus endeth the Matrix series, not with a bang but with a whimper - intellectually speaking that is."
"squeakerth2","8","28","39","12 November 2003"," My theory on the Matrix - how it all resolved and why I don't hate it so much (Warning: SPOILER)
","Ok, so the first time I saw Revolutions I left completely confused in the ""that didn't resolve a darn thing"" kind of way.... but then I thought about it a little more, watched the movie a second time, and I think I have a theory that, at least in my mind, resolves everything, and puts a nice little frame on the three movies...  So let me know what you think about my little theory.<br/><br/>Agent Smith and Neo were both created by the Oracle as a means of initiating a truce between the humans and the machines.<br/><br/>Sounds like a lot, so lets start at the beginning.  First of all, a small line, that many probably caught out of its sheer weirdness is when Agent Smith called the Oracle ""mom"".  As we'd seen in the beginning of the movie, it is possible for programs to create other programs, and this in an of itself is enough for me to think that quite possibly Smith was created by the Oracle.  Smith is, in my mind, most easily characterized as a virus. And there's something unique about Smith, even before the scene in the hallway in the first movie.  Of all the Agents, he's the only one that expresses a desire to get out of the Matrix.  There's something different about him, right from the beginning.<br/><br/>About Neo... I think, given the end of the movie, Neo could be most easily characterized as a ""virus fix,"" so to speak.  Now, it seems unlikely that the Oracle would be talking about ""The One,"" directing the humans towards finding ""The One"" if she didn't know that a virus fix was out there, and exactly where to find it.  And, given that the Oracle created Smith, it also seems most unlikely that the Oracle would create a virus without creating a ""virus fix.""  So that's why I think that the Oracle not only knew Neo would stop Smith, but had deliberately created Neo for that purpose.<br/><br/>First of all, addressing the who flabbergasted ""What?!?!  Neo a program?!!? Can't be!!!"" cries: to begin with, Agent Smith proved that a program can inhabit a human brain (ex. Bane).  Secondly, the Oracle says that the powers of ""The One"" extend all the way to where it came from, which is ""the source"" which I believe to be further proof of his possible ""programic roots"" so to speak.<br/><br/>Why did she do it?  To facilitate a truce between the humans and the machines.  At the beginning of the trilogy, the power balance is highly in favor of the machines.  To ever end the war, there needed to be a shift in power, ever so slight that would give the humans a right to demand a truce. That is why the Oracle created a problem (Smith, the virus) and offered the solution (Neo, the fix).  But she put the fix-it program in a human, which gave the humans an advantage over the machines (imbalance of equation) and gave them the opportunity to demand a truce<br/><br/>My last and final evidence for my theory.  In the very end scene, the Oracle and the Architect meet up.  The Architect's line: ""You play a very dangerous game.""  This shows that a) The Oracle was indeed a key player in the turn of events, not just a watcher,  b) The Architect and the Oracle were on opposing sides of this whole game (further delineated by the later discussion of terms for the release of the humans who wanted out of the Matrix).  <br/><br/>That's my story and I'm sticking to it... What do you think?"
"cpilgrim","9","60","95","30 March 2004"," Better when viewed twice...
","Initially, I was expecting the movie to be more plugged into the matrix than unplugged from it.  After deciding to go back and see the movie a second time with that expectation already established, I watched it again and thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  I understood then that the movie really required to be primarily ""unplugged"" in order to make any type of sense at all and close the trilogy.  It didn't hurt that the second viewing was on an IMAX, as well.  The sound and effects were simply amazing once again, and in spite of all the negative reviews out there, I am satisfied with the trilogy as a whole.  I look forward to adding the DVD to my collection; it will be well worth the investment that is required."
"nikecjc","10","294","519","5 November 2003"," I can't understand the hate. Amazing movie.
","We all know the original Matrix was easily the pinacle. But that's because it grabbed out attentions as something brand new. The first movie, if done correctly as the Matrix was, can open our eyes to new ideas we never considered in any strain of our imagination.<br/><br/> I'll admitt, Reloaded was a bit slow and perhaps a bit tedious at times. It was saved by an amazing Neo vs. Thousands of Smiths' battle, an even more amazing highway scene centered around Morpheus, and the appearance of the amazing Monica Belluci (a character I wish we'd heard more from the in the 3rd installment).<br/><br/> Now as for Revolutions. Unless you're unrealistic or a mass-media critic, who all hate anything outside of artsy or useless Indy movies that get ZERO major release...you'll enjoy and perhaps love Revolutions.<br/><br/> You get clarity to a lot of questions. You get resolution. No cliffhangers. People die and people survive, I won't dare say whom. You are brought all the way from dispair to happiness. Instead of simply giving the cheesy ending, the Matrix's ""end"" is proper and sensible.<br/><br/> Of course there are some plot holes, but I dare anyone and everyone to find a movie without numerous mistakes or unanswered questions. More and more directors should heed the advice of David Lynch and allow the audience to interpret a few things for themselves. Keep them thinking. (I won't open up a Lynch debate, that's for another time and place)<br/><br/> In the end, you'll enjoy Revolutions. It is action-packed with amazing special effects and the usual above-average acting and amazing creativity in the choreography of the fight scenes.<br/><br/> Agent Smith shines in a stellar performance by Hugo Weaving. His words to Neo throughout his battle are stellar. His encounter with the Oracle, awesome. Keanu, Fish, Carrie-Anne, Jada, and others for the fight for good are also as sharp as they need to be.<br/><br/> In the end, Revolutions is everything a true fan of the Matrix wants. And if they ask for more, they are not only guilty of being unrealistic, but also asking too much for an amazing trilogy.<br/><br/> A trilogy I believe should be held in the same breath as Star Wars (the original three), Back to the Future, Indiana Jones, and numerous other action-drama based trilogies. I'm sure I'll be adding the Lord of the Rings trilogy to that list, barring a collapse with the Return of the King (another debate for another time)."
"BravesPaul","10","141","243","9 November 2003"," Half I expected, and half was better than expected.
","Revolutions is much more concise and to the point than Reloaded was. The action is much more focused and purposeful, mostly because the movie is working its way toward a conclusion, rather than an open ending or a cliffhanger like either of the first two movies. The dialog is geared toward answering unanswered questions rather than raising new ones, and even the new questions raised in the third film can be answered by watching the film again (watch all three a few times over and you'll be as pointlessly knowledgeable about The Matrix universe as I am!).<br/><br/>Unlike Reloaded, even the score fits well with every scene in the movie. I didn't care too much for the rave scene (the scene or the music) in Reloaded, but I can't recall a moment in Revolutions when any scene or sounds felt contrived or unnecessary. If nothing else, I was more disappointed that some scenes and characters didn't appear in the movie! For instance, the Merovingian and his goons were grossly underused in this film! Such an egotistical, maniacal character should be the focus of more attention than what he received in what is supposed to be the best movie of the trilogy.<br/><br/>(One thing I must say to any viewers who criticize the film because it doesn't look real enough or doesn't feel right: you need to stop thinking like an illogical human and treat The Matrix like what it is: something that isn't real. It's science fiction, and much of the action takes place in a computer simulated dream world that is described as an imperfect simulation of the ""real world"". That is all.)<br/><br/>I have been more involved in The Matrix than I have been in any other media phenomenon to hit pop culture, which means that it is simply, for whatever reason, the realization of an idea that works very well for me. The Wachowski brothers put together an excellent body of work with these films and accompanying works on various media -- so excellent, in fact, that I am easily distracted by discussion of The Matrix, both within the context of the story and above and beyond the story (symbolism, allegorical applications, etc.)<br/><br/>My only complaints were that the Merovingian was grossly underused, the fate of the Twins and some other characters was not explained, and the Kid's triumphant ""The war is over!"" at the end was a bit premature, given what we had just watched for the last two hours.<br/><br/>Finally, everyone should keep in mind that the machines have Neo's code, and whether Keanu Reeves comes back or not, his intellect may yet survive in the Matrix somehow..."
"manalone923","8","62","103","7 April 2004"," Fairly satisfying conclusion, but there are disappointments, and it still doesn't make total sense.
","(No plot spoilers.)<br/><br/>Like most others, I loved the Matrix. And like a lot of others, I was underwhelmed with Reloaded. But for Revolutions, I came out pretty happy. You do see an end, and there are some surprises. But I was still left with important unanswered questions, and that's kind of inexcusable for the finale in a 7 hour trilogy.<br/><br/>What Matrix Revolutions brings to the table is a giant war. The machines have reached Zion, it's the last stand for the humans, and Neo must make a choice that could bring him face-to face with the machine city and a possible end to the war.<br/><br/>After a slow but interesting start, we see the war begin. It's a special effects frenzy, similar to that of Lord of the Rings or the arena battle at the end of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones. The war scene makes up the entire middle third of the film, and for what it's supposed to display, it does it well enough. Aside from legions of the ""squiddies"", or Sentinels, there are a couple new machines that are fascinating to watch: Giant, drilling creatures that instill an appropriate feeling of dread and power. On the human side, there's a small army of walking robots similar to the Power Loader machines in ""Aliens"", but with extensive firepower. This results in long sequences of shooting, attacking, and screaming, which is going to uninspire fans of the Matrix's deeper plot but which is appropriate for a war setting.<br/><br/>The only problem is that a lot of this is pretty standard stuff. Grizzled military commanders will be hard on young soldiers, who find their courage and prove their true worth. People will be injured and give important information in a speech just before dying. The heroes will be doubted but still do just enough to prove their doubters wrong.<br/><br/>But then one of the bigger overall problems is that the main characters are sort of lost amongst the backdrop of war. Morpheus has maybe 30 lines, becoming a shadow of the informative, enigmatic hero he was in the original. This time, he's reduced mainly to someone who hopes Neo saves the world while himself taking orders as co-captain of Niobe's ship.  Trinity has little else to do either besides tag along with Neo or do a couple arbitrary flips and kicks.<br/><br/>And then there's actually a few more specific problems. A very important scene with Neo and Trinity occurs within the movie's last half hour, and although it's dramatic it too is cliche. What's worse, after the scene is over the plot just moves right along as if it didn't matter, without it even being mentioned again. Given the importance of the scene, and the fact that it's occuring between two characters who we've known for years, it feels like it's over way too quickly.  That's just a letdown. The same thing occurs with the appearance if the Architect, the builder of the Matrix. He has a brief scene in this film, and has almost nothing important or informative to say whatsoever. Again, it seems like a waste, especially due to the fact that he SHOULD have interesting things to say by the point at which he appears in the film.<br/><br/>Finally there's the film's conclusion, which I won't reveal. I will say that it was one of the less predictable of possible outcomes. But it too is a letdown in a couple ways: First, it leaves quite a few important questions unanswered, and could be construed as leaving the door open for a sequel, but also could be seen as the absolute finish. But that's the problem. If it's the end, I want my questions answered, I want to know the hows and whys. The final minutes left me wanting, left me thinking that there were several possible conclusions to the story that aren't there on film. And in my opinion, that shouldn't happen at the end of something this large and built up to.<br/><br/>But what really matters is whether I enjoyed the film. Although the review doesn't sound like I did, that's actually not the case. I went in planning to know what I wanted to know, and while I didn't learn everything I still did spend a couple fun hours watching an action movie. The acting, score, and effects were pretty much on par with the other films so there's nothing lost there, but it's the details that hurt. Where the original Matrix was a smart script that mostly made sense, this one was more or less action with an incomplete plot wrapup. But it still did have several good scenes, and many of the special effects were great (I loved machine city, with its vast fields and burned skies). I also truly loved the music for the final fight, and during the end credits.<br/><br/>Still, while Reloaded had a standout chase scene as well as some great kung fu like the 100 Smith brawl, this one had neither. There is a climactic and important Neo/Smith battle at the end of Revolutions, but it too is different: In demonstrating the epic and dramatic repercussions of this battle, it consists mostly of giant (albeit very cool) effects, lots of flying, and very little actual close combat. This makes Revolutions unfortunately boil down to a plot far less interesting and focused than the original Matrix, as well as far, far less kung fu. There's also much less complicated story development than in Reloaded, but that's probably a good thing. That doesn't leave Revolutions with much to digest however, aside from a long war scene and a plot wrapup that doesn't explain much more than the most immediate questions. Even the actual ""ending"" after the big fight is pretty brief, which then is followed by the closing scenes that make things confusing again.<br/><br/>In the end, Revolutions is still fun to watch, and I still like it 2nd of the trilogy. It's just not as tight and fun as the original, and it kind of deflated after the information overload of Reloaded. Not a bad movie at all, it just falls a little short of the great climax worthy of what the Matrix began years ago. Not in style or flash, but in making everything fit.  I'd still recommend it to those who saw the first two, just don't expect that big, revelatory plot scene where everything make sense - that's still missing."

"imprator","2","121","218","16 February 2006"," We Used Up All Our Ideas In The First Movie, Part 2
","Before seeing the first Matrix movie I didn't expect to like it. I was dead wrong  I loved that film. I therefore looked forward to the next two. I was wrong again  I hated them both. Each is execrable, but ""Revolutions"" is the worst.<br/><br/>In fact, ""hate"" is the wrong word to use for this movie. Rather, I was bored. Revolutions is dull, unimaginative and impenetrable. I know, there are people out there who see impenetrable as deep and meaningful. In this case it's not. It is shallow and meaningless.<br/><br/>Revolutions has three distinct parts. In the first third not much happens, and what does happen is of no import. Most of the audience will have been lost by the end of this portion of the film  disinterest will have caused their minds to drift. As the movie proceeds some may think that this inattention was the reason they didn't understand the film  that they were at fault, not the movie. This is a mistake; Revolutions really is as dull and meaningless as it appears.<br/><br/>The second third of the movie is a seemingly unending, desperately repetitive shoot-'em-up. There are lots of special effects, but they are used to no actual effect. Moreover, the effects aren't really very special. The entire battle scene uses the old trick of low lighting and shadow to imply great effects without actually showing them. It doesn't work. All we see are duplications of the same few (very few) basic machines  an obvious economy.<br/><br/>Moreover, some of the machine designs are just stupid. For example - why create a giant metal walking extension of a man, a walking waldo fighting machine, and then leave the operator totally exposed to  well, anything, really. These war machines couldn't beat a stone-age tribe. ""Look, here comes one of those stupid machines again. Let's just hide behind this rock/tree/hillock until it's close, then throw a spear/axe/knife/rock at the driver, kill him and take his machine for our own."" As for emotional involvement with the characters in the battle  forget it. They are, without exception, poorly drawn, shallow caricatures. If they die nobody in the audience is going to care  the characters aren't real people, just pale, humourless shadows.<br/><br/>Another lowlight of this central third of the movie (an entire third of the movie used up on this drivel!) is the acting. Poor throughout the film, the ""acting"" of the characters in the ""battle third"" is truly ridiculous. The General is the worst culprit, closely followed by the Council members, then  well, everyone else, really. It's almost as if the actors had no idea what the movie was about and - ah, yes, of course <br/><br/>WARNING - SPOILERS ARE PRESENT FROM THIS POINT ON<br/><br/>Then there is the film's ending, its ""climax"". Spectacular it isn't. No explanations are provided, no great revelations occur.<br/><br/>What we have is Trinity taking forever to die from injuries that quite clearly would have killed her almost immediately. Never mind, we get to hear her spout something about love again and again and again while Neo (on a desperately urgent mission to save Mankind's last hope for a future) takes his ease and waits for her to finish her pointless homilies.<br/><br/>After the woman finally dies Neo cuts a deal with the machines to eliminate Agent Smith in return for ""peace"". There is a bit of a fight, some meaningless wordplay, then Agent Smith attempts to absorb Neo. Neo becomes a duplicate Smith, the original Smith acts confused and the other duplicate Smiths go pop, followed by the original. The Neo Smith becomes Neo again, but dies  probably. He's carted away in a manner that suggests some kind of Messiah figure. The machines stop attacking the city and that's that.<br/><br/>Much thought has gone into this film's ending by those seeking a deeper meaning. My own interpretation is that Neo ""knew"" the Matrix to be a fantasy to a degree and with an absence of doubt that others could not achieve whilst interacting within the Matrix. This knowledge gave him the power to manipulate the fantasy. It also grounded him to reality (the ""Source""), and when the program Smith attempted to absorb his enemy he became ""grounded"" to reality through Neo. Programs are just lines of code in the real world; so Smith's existence as a coherent being could not continue.<br/><br/>However, deep thought into the ""meaning"" of the ending is wasted. This was a very poor, unsatisfactory finale. In fact, the entire movie was dire. It was both dull and dull-witted. It is obvious that the writers used up all their good ideas on the first movie. That film was excellent  imaginative, innovative and understandable. It was complete in itself. But it was also very successful, and successful films must have cash-in sequels. So ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" came to be.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there really wasn't much left to tell after the first film  and certainly not enough for TWO films. Neo had been left in a position to wrap things up in the first movie, but that was a tale that would take only a short time to tell  and would be uninteresting in the telling. So the writers chose to go all mystical and spiritual, seeking to imply depth and content where there was actually nothing, whilst providing a great big shoot-up to fill time and amuse adolescents and video game fans. It isn't enough. Not even close.<br/><br/>I would suggest that anyone who has not yet seen this movie should ignore the praise of those who imbue it with a depth and meaning that it just doesn't have. This is a bad film, pure and simple.<br/><br/>Avoid."
"pietzsche","Null","102","184","28 August 2004"," Action-Packed Tedium
","It is hard to believe that the original Matrix's philosophical subtlety came from the same authors of the two sequels.<br/><br/>It seems the brothers must have cribbed the original story for the first Matrix, since the last 2 show none of the original's subtlety or interest, just rehashing and CGI multiplication.<br/><br/>One evil robot, two evil robots, many many evil robots. Wow, what an idea, what creativity!<br/><br/>Viewing the behind-the-scenes on DVD disc 2, you can see the reasons for the incoherence of story and scenes - the huge fractured design team, numerous 'senior this' 'senior that', all contributing to some corporate creation lacking any inspiration. Maybe the corporate cube-farm culture works for making cars, but it doesn't seem to work for films.<br/><br/>I would have liked to have seen another level of reality exposed behind the mindless machines, and why are they so mindlessly evil when they can think up such a subtle ruse to enslave the humans? It isn't consistent. Why not introduce an alien ET culture who is really the master culture enslaving the machine culture by some similar hallucinatory ruse. Or, have the humans escape by transcending their bodies, as in all the traditional gnostic spiritualities.<br/><br/>All in all, the Matrix is just a retread of the movie TRON. TRON at least had some insight into what the machine mindset and motivation for domination might be, e.g. tyrannical game addiction, much like the decadent Roman emperors. The Matrix, after the first film, gives no thought to any subtle motivations of the machine culture, preferring the tired cliché of 'alien villain = mindless unrelenting violence'."
"puppyperson","8","109","202","5 November 2003"," Still trying to absorb what I've seen
","Going into this movie I had one wish: To leave feeling that it was a successful conclusion to a two-part film.  Taking Reloaded/Revolutions as a single (very large) movie with an intermission is the best way to evaluate it.  Viewed that way I think it succeeded.  I thought Revolutions was the equal of Reloaded, yet I can see how many will think it failed.  The ending gave us everything we needed to know, but did not show us all we wanted to see.  I'm speaking of the last twenty minutes or so here.  After a visually robust middle, in which I felt my eyes grow larger in their sockets more than once, the ending seemed like an anticlimax. It needed to be longer, and I would gladly have traded some of the fx flair used earlier to give the final part of the film it's justified due.  It will be awhile before I can look at it more objectively (perhaps I'll have to wait to view the two parts as one on DVD).  I only suggest now that anyone seeing it let it sink in completely before being too critical."
"koala88","10","32","53","10 November 2003"," for the minds & souls who are ready..
","So we have reached the end of Matrix. This was an amazing trilogy with a lot of metaphors which everybody have missed. Third film have it's down & ups just like the second. The problem is, first film was so perfect that everybody wanted to see the rest like that. But after all, we have a very effective trilogy here and it only shows you are not ready if you didn't like the second or third film. From that point you are free to choose disgracing yourself by saying ""this film sucks"", ""this is soo bad"" etc. etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*****potential spoilers from now on**********<br/><br/>Now let's take a different look to the old question: What is the Matrix?<br/><br/>
I've seen Matrix as a ""personal"" story. I mean not ""my"" personal but this is the journey of a person in life/universe etc. We see lots of characters in 3 films which may be described as parts of a person like:<br/><br/>
Morpheus: faith, wisdom. Trinity: emotions. Agent Smith: negative side of self. Maybe devil. Maybe cancer cells (please check how cancer cells spread in an organism). Architect: pure mind, logic. Merovingian: ego, self-opportunism. Cypher: fear accompanied by ignorance (also the opposite) Oracle: connection to higher-self or God or whatever you call.<br/><br/>Neo: This is the important question. Let's call it ""I"".<br/><br/>Matrix: illusions that our mind (architect) and perceptions show us. Machines: so-called ""external world"" that creates illusions for us. It seems very hard to beat them.<br/><br/>Matrix Trilogy is the story of ""I"" who learns about itself/life/universe etc etc. You may consider it as a story of personal development. The illusions (matrix) that is created by the world surrounds us (machines) is everywhere. If you are not aware of anything, than you are lucky. But if you find some voice, some disturbing feeling inside (morpheus) you have to give a decision. Listen to it (take the red pill), or forget about it (take the blue pill). If you listen to it, this voice takes you to a very interesting & primaly dark journey (to the nebuchadnezzar). In the beginning there will be times that you feel very bad, but by time you'll realize your powers (you'll see zion). You find a leading voice that shows the way (the oracle). In fact this voice gives you only one message: KNOW YOURSELF. But your mind tells you these are all nonsense, worthless crap (the architect). In fact the illusions are created by this very mind.<br/><br/>As the journey goes on, you realize some negative thoughts never stop chasing you from the beginning (agent smiths). If you ever get weak, these thoughts are ready to absorb you. You also need your emotions (Trinity) to end the journey - because there may be a time that your eyes are blind, you have to trust your feelings - but only to one point. You have to FULLY understand what you are to end the illusions. At that point you may open your 7 chakras or have a mir'ac (ascension) or see yourself as jesus - depending on the illusion that your own culture already gave you.<br/><br/>
After that, your higher-self (oracle) may tell your mind (architect) that was a great play that is worth to experience. Your pure mind may not be happy about what has happened, but it knows that it lost the control - no separate part is in control when you have your WHOLENESS (or holiness)..."
"NiGe2011","7","48","85","9 November 2003"," a large step in the right direction
","""The Matrix, Revolutions"" was not on the level with the original, this much is true.  However, it was undoubtedly a large step in the right direction.<br/><br/>
To start with the most praise-worthy aspect of ""Revolutions"", being that of visuals.  From a visual standpoint this movie was amazing, the CGI was unrivaled by anything that had ever come before it.  The final battle between Smith and Neo easily places itself somewhere in my three favorite cinematic sequences of all time.  And the battle between the machines and humans in Zion is also jaw-dropping.  From a purely visual standpoint this movie is simply the best of three (which is boasting a lot since the free-way chase in the sub par ""Reloaded"" was quite the sight itself).  The CGI is probably the best in any movie ever made, a notch above ""Reloaded"", which at times felt as though it were a video game, and worlds ahead of any of the recent Star War's movies.<br/><br/>Another improvement that was made upon the previous installments of the series was the music.  Gone are cheesy techno theme's and watered-down POD lyrics.  Instead we get to feast upon more gospel and, dare I say, epic themed musical backgrounds.  Epic, as it would turn out, is the word that could best describe the feel of this final Matrix chapter, the entire time you feel as though you are engaged in something epic and important.<br/><br/>The acting is right back where it should have been in the second one, as all characters are portrayed better by their respective actors/actresses. Fishburne provides us with probably his strongest performance of the three, he is in a the role of a more emotional Morpheus then we have seen before. And it certainly turns out to be a role that he seems comfortable in. Reeves and Moss also both seem to be right back in their acting grooves (this is of course assuming Keanu ever had one).  Also, Agent Smith definitely is the strongest character in this movie, the acting is right-on and the character is developed to completely new heights as true sadistic colors come out completely for the viewer to enjoy.<br/><br/>The only complaints that can be made are about the over done philisophical conversations and the movie's open ended conclusion.  ""Revolutions"" at times feels as though it is trying too hard to be intellectual.  Impending death does not need to make everybody do their best Plato impersonations.  And in the end you may feel as though the movie has left you as clueless as when the series first began...  Then again, you may also feel as though you have figured it all out.  But irregardless the future of The Matrix is left up in the air.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Revolutions"" will be hated by some people and loved by others, there will be no gray here.  It is hard not to measure it up to the first Matrix, which leaves it looking slightly wanting.  However, it turns out to be thousands of times better then ""Reloaded"" (which I feel was a solid flick itself!)  And one thing that the open ended conclusion does do for me, is fill me with hope that the journey down the rabbit hole is not yet over."
"seraphin-5","9","28","47","30 September 2008"," Amazing movie in my opinion - hated and not understood by many
","Matrix Revolutions is deliberately constructed as a puzzle in which you have to work out the complete picture for yourself. It contains some fundamental questions of philosophy, a war story of a hopeless struggle against the machines who besiege Zion and it comes to a conclusion which is not understood by many viewers. The philosophical questions are answered (e.g. some choices lead to a string of consequences which may often appear as predestination), the war scenes in Zion are overwhelming and the final scenes depict the reestablishment of harmony between body, mind and soul. The absence of this harmony being one of the major reasons for conflict and war.<br/><br/>The Wachowski brothers did also make some mistakes when designing Matrix Revolutions:<br/><br/><ul><li>Scenes like the train station take a bit too long although they contain important hints for the story that is about to unfold. This way the movie loses pace at times. Some viewers also felt that the war in Zion occupies too much space - but come on, this is mankind's last stand so this fight is bound to have epic proportions.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Wachovskis do NOT explain their story design and its implications. Viewers are expected to figure it all out for themselves. This is simply rejected by many people who -not without any justification- expect to be told a little more what the plot is all about instead of following hints in dialogues and imagery.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The philosophy is often criticised as basic. But the questions raised are fundamental by nature: choice vs. predestination, harmony of body, mind and soul, do humans define themselves through suffering etc.. Furthermore, how should machines completely understand deep mythology and philosophy of humans and depict that convincingly in their artificial construct known as the Matrix? The stereotypes in the Matrix (e.g. the Merovingian) are to me a natural consequence of machines trying to reproduce human myths and ideas.</li></ul><br/><br/>But the negative points of Matrix Revolutions are by far outweighed by the positive aspects of the movie:<br/><br/><ul><li>There is a colour code in all Matrix movies. Blue is the physical world, green represents mind/rationality and bright yellow or white stands for the soul of a being. All scenes in the real world have a blue hue, the Matrix is always somewhat green and e.g. the machine city, many images of the sentinels and the power lines from the fields where humans are grown - they are all coloured in bright white or yellow. This represents the separation of body, mind and soul which is overcome only in the final scenes of Matrix Revolutions where all colours are mixed in the sky's clouds - this is by the way the contribution of Sati to the revolution/recreation of the (new) Matrix.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The connection of the real world and the Matrix is the spirit or soul the machines acquire from the humans. Programs and machines now have emotions and feelings (remember the parents in the train station?). Even Agent Smith has some twisted soul. Neo can feel and manipulate the spirits of simple machines but he has significant difficulties to handle more complex machines like sentinels. Similarly, Agent Smith has to struggle hard to control the human called Bane who becomes schizophrenic in that process.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The energy which the machines drain from the humans is not so much physical or electrical power but mental energy (soul). Like the Architect said in Matrix Reloaded when Neo claims that machines need humans to survive: ""There are levels of survival we are willing to accept!"". So the machines tap into the souls of humans in order to get something their human creators could not grace them with: a real soul and real feelings. The machines are, however, willing to sacrifice these gifts in order to ensure their mere physical survival. It is quite an amazing outcome of the Matrix storyline: humans exist only because they are useful - they provide real feelings and emotions for the machines and they can even be used to control rogue programs in the Matrix which challenge the existence of the Matrix itself (Neo is used as a carrier for life-force in order to overcome Smith who represents death).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Neo has to finally realise that only his own sacrifice can end the conflict between machines and humans. He has to accept his evil twin brother Smith and reunite with him in order to become complete. This resonates with Asian Yin-Yang philosophy.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Oracle has an interesting role. Neo has become too powerful even for Agent Smith and his duplicates. So the Oracle merges with one of the copies of Agent Smith in order to create the one copy of Agent Smith with enough power to really challenge Neo. It is the Oracle's deliberate sacrifice which finally leads to the death of Neo while he reunites himself with his evil opposite Smith - Neo has to realise that he cannot win against Smith and instead of continuing the final fight with Smith he chooses to sacrifice himself in order to end the war and the domination of the Matrix by Smith.</li></ul><br/><br/>Sadly it's impossible to provide guidance for understanding the Matrix Trilogy without spoilers. The Wachovskis made some mistakes by not involving their audiences in the plot developments. They kept their ideas to themselves and only provided hints for the viewers to make their own discoveries. I was quite pleased by the challenges provided in getting a (rather) complete understanding of the Matrix Trilogy. But I can also imagine that many viewers were lost in the process and did not find the whole exercise worthwhile. As you might guess by now, I recommend that those who dislike Matrix Revolutions give this amazing movie another chance. I sincerely hope that my comments open up some new perspectives on a film trilogy that blended Sci-Fi, action and philosophy in such a brilliant and innovative way."
"miokey2004","1","151","298","8 June 2004"," Not as bad as you've heard--it's worse.
","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>After protesting for as long as I could, my brother convinced me to see the third installment of the Matrix trilogy, The Matrix Revolutions. I will begin by saying that I was a big fan of the first film, and was curious to see how the story would end. I went into the movie with as open a mind as I could, but after the first forty-five minutes I was just angry at how bad the movie really was.<br/><br/>It was at this point that Neo was reunited with Trinity after being held by the ""Frenchman"" in a sort of limbo (in this case it was a white on white on white train station.) This story line was entirely useless, especially since the conflict was resolved and served no point in the rest of the movie, except to introduce a cute little girl who is a machine, a useless program going on to live with the Oracle. (I lie, this story-line also gave the Wachowski brothers an excuse to film both a bondage night club and Monica Belucci's ample cleavage.)<br/><br/>The movie goes on from there building up tension and ""drama"" that leads up to the breaching of the last human city, Zion. Another thing I do not understand is why the humans want to be free? The Matrix is a much better place to live than the real world, which is dark and cold and only hospitable under the ground. The people here have reverted to a new religion and to wearing horrifically unflattering clothing. Why would they choose this life of constant turmoil and darkness over the life of at least supposed happiness in the matrix?<br/><br/>The movie builds up to two climaxes, one involving Neo in the Machine City and another involving the rest of mankind in Zion. In the end there is a depressingly anti-climatic battle in Zion where lots of stuff blows up real good, and not one person shows a single emotion. It is as if the directors told each actor to choose an emotion and facial expression to go along with that emotion and to stick with it. Watch closely Morpheus and Trinity for an example of this.<br/><br/>Neo ends up having to fight the billions of Agents Smiths that have taken over the Matrix. If he wins, there will be peace, if not Zion will be destroyed. Since it all comes down to this battle, then what was the point of the rest of the movie? Especially the drawn out battle scene that precedes the films second climax? It is enough to make a person mad.<br/><br/>In the end Neo of course defeats Smith in a manner that made no sense to me or my brother. Peace is declared and the Matrix trilogy comes to the most infuriating happy ending ever in the history of movies.<br/><br/>Earlier I said that I was a fan of the first film, that has all changed because of what the Matrix went on to become. With the first film, they made history, but with the second two the Wachowski's have committed murder. The special effects in the second two movies are not eve as impressive, especially in Revolutions (never before have I seen a more boring gun fight!) This movie is infuriating and poorly written with so/so special effects and some of the worst acting ever captured o film (Yes, I am including the Star Wars Prequels). Skip this movie, skip Reloaded and simply watch the Matrix on DVD. It is far better."
"ken_1969","10","45","81","10 November 2003"," Everything that has a beginning...
","IMHO, when the Wachokwski brothers came up with the idea of ""The Matrix"" they did not realise just what a hot potato it would be.<br/><br/>Before I go any further, let's not forget that both The Matrix and Reloaded are in the top 40 grossing movies of all time, and these are the first big budget movies the Wachowski brothers have done.  For all Reloaded's slating by critics, it is the 13th highest grossing movie of all time.  At $735,300,000 it almost doubled the Matrix' $456,300,000.  These are popular movies, not art house movies.  There is no question that Revolutions will join them in the top 40 - I predict in the top 15.<br/><br/>The second thing to remember is, this is a comic book.  The Wachowski brothers are huge comic book fans, and anime fans.  They envisioned this project as if it were a comic book or anime project, but they rightly predicted it would be so much cooler if they could make it as a movie.<br/><br/>
More, they had the determination to get it made.  The studio system turned them down initially and so they `hacked into the system' by creating the excellent low budget movie, Bound as a showcase for their capabilities.<br/><br/>
Then, Warner Bros didn't `get' the Matrix so when SFX costs were expanding during the early stages they closed it down.  But not to be defeated, the Wachowski's pulled out all the stops to get the opening sequence with Trinity at the Heart O The City motel edited together, which blew the studio execs away and ensured they got the SFX budget they needed.<br/><br/>I think these guys should be proud of themselves!  They created a fantasy / sci-fi world which has it's own internal logic, breathed life into it, imbued it with layers of philosophy, intelligence, wit, but most of all with a hefty dose of cool.<br/><br/>For those who are whinging about the sequels being `such a disappointment' - go do better!<br/><br/>Everybody I speak to seems to enjoy the Matrix on a different level, or likes many of the multiple layers of meaning, but I suspect none of us ""get"" all those layers - probably not even Larry and Andy to be fair! ;)  But it's obvious from reading some of the comments here that a lot of people did not `get' the Matrix at all!<br/><br/>If you are after standard dialog, plotting and the ""satisfactory"" ending in true Hollywood(TM) style, then you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>What many critics miss when they talk about how different Reloaded and Revolutions are, is that this is a story in three chapters with a beginning, middle and end. Each chapter has it's own challenges and needs, and the Wachowskis were willing to go the distance to get their movie done in accordance with their vision.<br/><br/>Bullet time was the big thing in the original - Neo learns he can dodge bullets - but it was not needed in the second and third movie - Neo won't have to dodge bullets anymore.  But they had their own challenges.  I look at the Burly Brawl and Neo vs the Merovingians henchmen as stand out moments in terms of artistry and craft in sci-fi action movies.  The fights are ballet.<br/><br/>Gaeta and his SFX team move the benchmark by rendering true `virtual stuntmen' in virtual worlds. Taking the `virtual stuntman' one step further, the adrenaline pumping freeway chase combining real and virtual vehicles makes for the most amazing car chase I've ever seen. Can you tell which vehicles are real and which are not?  I couldn't!<br/><br/>For those who claim Reloaded offered nothing new or original in the way of ideas - were you watching the same movie?  In the first movie there's that jaw-dropping moment when Keanu wakes up in his pod in the real world. He's then led down a path by Morpheus who believes he is `The One'.<br/><br/>
In Reloaded the Wachowski's take that message and turn it on it's head. The legend of The One is another system of control!  Morpheus' faith is totally destroyed, along with his ship, and then another shocker (although I admit I predicted this from the first movie) he appears to have powers now in the real world.  The final `shocker' is Bane, who we know is now Smith, inches from his enemy as a cliffhanger finale.<br/><br/>***MAJOR SPOILER ALERT*** Then we get to Revolutions.  I admit, it's more an Evolution than a Revolution, because unlike Matrix to Reloaded there was no 4 year gap for technology to advance.  But as a sequel to Reloaded it is a far better movie in that it takes us to the denouement.<br/><br/>Along the way to the finale we have some more super cool moments.  Neo, blinded by Bane, sees him for what he really is, and beats the crap out of him. Superb!  The APU/Squiddy battle royale in the dock is tense, emotive, and powerful.<br/><br/>But does Revolutions cop out and take us down a predictable path? No!<br/><br/>
Neo does not lead the humans into war with the machines and free them by force.  Why? Because WAR IS BAD.  Instead, he co-operates and negotiates with the machines in a common goal.  Both he and Trinity sacrifice themselves to win the peace.<br/><br/>And finally the `super brawl' - Smith vs Neo - the guy who said this is no better than the fight between Superman and General Zod in Superman II should go watch that dated movie again honestly!  I have been reading comic books for over 20 years, and this is the best superhuman fight scene ever brought to film, bar none.<br/><br/>But again, does it end with Neo kicking Smith's butt? No, it has a more subtle and more powerful ending.  Here is Smith, the ultimate nihilist, death personified, vs Neo the existential positivist. The humanist.  And he wins by having the courage to accept his fate.<br/><br/>Agree with it or disagree, this trinity of movies is visionary, and it rocks!"

It's worth giving up your life in the matrix; it's worth living a life underground in sewers and caves; it's worth fighting and dying for.

"mfiedler","1","66","126","8 November 2003"," Ok, are you ready for this? *SPOILERS*
","Right-o. Just got back from watching this, and let me tell you, what a waste of a Saturday night, not to mention money.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Matrix"" and was quite happy with the way it ended. I was reluctant to see ""Matrix: Reloaded"", and in fact protested going, until I received complimentary tickets to that opening night. Having seen THAT, and being put off by SO many reasons, I was extremely hesitant to go to this one. My roommate convinced me to go, as he had put together a group of 7 people, and we all went, and I was hopeful, but not convinced that it would be worth the time.<br/><br/>That being said, of the 7 of us, more than once, 4 of us came up with ""Star Wars"" related jokes at precisely the same time, and comments were shuttling back and forth our row. The amount of un-originality was reprehensible, and a massive disappointment to us all. I was hoping for some closure that was not attained in ""Reloaded"", which was a master marketing ploy on the production's end, ""Keep them coming back for more"" all over again. Sequel suicide.<br/><br/>The amount of impossibilities presented to us were too many to suspend disbelief for, as a lot of them were, ""Let's see if we can do THIS effect!"" and proceeded to do so, without regards to storyline. Trinity's dying scene was not entirely unexpected, but the length of it was. Literally: ""I've waiting so long to tell you how much I wanted to tell you how much I love you, and I waited too long, too long,"" etc. ad nauseum. Not surprisingly, I was whispering to my neighbor, ""Die, already!!"" When finally dead, a round of applause rose from the audience, and catcalls and such were provided to place a point on my sentiment.<br/><br/>A word to any who appreciate battles: Strategy! Some of the ideas were so painfully obvious, we were reciting the next few minutes to each other, and at one point, ""Hell, I could write a better sequence than this"" was mentioned. Some basic strategies of both offense and defense were simply too easy to be overlooked, however, they were. I call to order: sentinels. Once past the dome's hole, they merge into a flowing, snake-like form, that then proceeds to direct a single blast, probably to overwhelm enemies in numbers. This was visually stunning, no argument there. Pure eye candy. The behavioral pattern we've seen in sentinels is that they attack as a bunch of individual units, each trying to tear it's way, for instance, into a hovercraft. Why the sudden (psychological??) change? In fact, I'd think it the other way around. When presented with multiple targets, spread your forces, harder to strike at, and a better chance that the enemy will be overwhlemed. Enough on that.<br/><br/>Defense? Mechwarriors to the rescue! Whether they be BattleBots, Mechwarriors, or some really souped-up battle suits, COVER THE PILOTS! afford them SOME sort of protection, even if it doesn't do much but give the pilot a false sense of security! Again, visually stunning, I'm sure it was very difficult to create a lifelike situation there, but pointless. Enough on THAT.<br/><br/>""Star Trek""'s classic ""Red Shirt"" syndrome was highly active, and you Trekkies will know what I mean. How many characters were we introduced to, with the immediate obvious reaction that they are going to die VERY soon. To name a couple, the ""medic"" on the Logos, dies at the hands of Bane (Ag. Smith), and the ""tough girl"" Charra, were some simple choices to take out, so there WOULD be some intimate human casualties, not to mention the unknowns that were demolished, exploded, snatched by sentinels, etc.<br/><br/>Are you still reading? Have I captured your interest? Well, I shall go on.<br/><br/>One serious offense to my sensibilities, and apparently to others as well, was that if inside the Matrix, a speeding bullet is dodgeable, how come physical blows aren't? This has sat uneasily with me since Matrix 1, and has yet to really make sense, especially since Smith is changing reality inside, what is to prevent him, or the guards outside the Merovingian's club. If you can walk on the ceiling, or fly through the air, what's to prevent you from using the same ""force"" (hint: Star Wars reference! Again!) to obtain a weapon, instead of back-flipping your way across the middle of an enemy-infested room?<br/><br/>Smith's assimilation of everyone was again, Star Wars-ish, ""Borg time!"" Apparently, when he grabbed everyone, he obtained their knowledge and capabilities. Does that work? A virus takes over, and re-writes the software to do its own agenda, thereby creating identical Smithies, who, by the way, blown to Smith-ereens. (Pardon my pun, but I just heard you groan.) If reality is malleable, and to a great extent at that, why not mess it up more? Nope. Software apparently has physical constraints. My roommate said, ""Hey, forget guns, create an energy weapon with sufficient blast radius to be inescapable."" To which I replied, ""Forget that, bring in the sun!"" (ref. James Bond: Die Another Day).<br/><br/>Seriously, if you're reading this, go to bed already. It's late. Don't trust my opinion, go see the movie, and THEN agree with me. But by then, the great corporation will already have your hard-earned cash. If you DO trust me, wait until you can rent it, and enjoy (or NOT!) in the privacy of your own home, so that after it's over, you can yell and scream about it, and NOT get harassed by others outside the theater, like I did.<br/><br/>That's my rant on the subject. Hoped you enjoyed it. I mean the rant, not the movie. :)"
"Med-Jasta","10","5","6","25 February 2020"," Amazing conclusion to Reloaded!
","And of course the entire trilogy but since this is the second half of Reloaded it perfectly pays off what the first half set up and comes to a satisfyingly conclusion to the story of The One.<br/><br/>The siege is truly amazing. The swarms of sentinels bursting in is so jaw dropping. The upsides down fight at the start. And of course the epic duel with Smith.<br/><br/>I absolutely love where this story goes. We've seen so many of these epic series come to great ends and they usually do it the same way: an epic fight with the bad guys. I'm not knocking that but Neo stopping the war by making a deal with the machines to stop Smith, their common enemy just blew my mind. I did not see that coming and it made so much sense. Every action has a reaction. There's The One, brought to bring peace. Then the many, Smith, the opposite to Neo, the anti matter to his matter, created to destroy that's it. This deal couldn't exist without the One because he created Smith. And this deal ends the war. I loved it. And I love that they end the war but don't destroy the machines. Very realistic ending.<br/><br/>Full of great themes. We need machines. Neo beats Smith with the help of the machines. Trinity's death is a very moving scene, the whispering was a nice touch and made it much more intimate. I love the machine God saying ""We don't need you, we need nothing!""<br/><br/>I really liked following the secondary characters. They were good and the ground work was laid. And they aren't main so they could die, a lot of suspense. And I like how Z and the Kid meet up at the very end. Jada was great. I really like that character. Very tough and good.<br/><br/>I could keep going and going. If you don't like this movie it's probably worth watching this and Reloaded closely together if not back to back. It is one movie."

","I see that I am not alone, other people were dissapointed with this pathetic,decidely tawdry attempt at a film. The first movie had the right aesthetic blend of visuals coupled with some interesting philosophical questioning. Matrix 3 Revolutions does not have a single bone of originality contained within its rather sad, scrawny little frame. Instead it is reduced to the self referential, with the same moves and same scenes from the original film being endlessly repeated. Transparently the film grafts off ideas from the Star Wars movie's in terms of not only themes - (the flight of the nebuchednezzar through the dimly lit tunnels of Zion will remind many film aficianados of the millenium falcon's journey through the Death Star in Return Of The Jedi) - but music, too. The hydraulically devised robotic suits that the defenders of Zion don to defend their city from the enemy are blatant derivatives of the loader mechanism used by Ripley in Alien. The action sequences are disparately littered throughout the course of this nearly three hour film, with the majority of its content being devoted to mind numbingly boring exchanges between Neo and Trinity, Neo and Oracle etc (you know the drill: dull, soporific dialogues along the lines of 'Ah, but Neo you know', 'ah, but I don't', 'but you do really'...just get to the f*****g point Oracle. If you know the answer just tell him!) Who did they hire to write this godawful mess, the scriptwriters of Sunset Beach?<br/><br/>Revolutions: it might just make you dizzy...spend your five pounds on something worthwhile like 'Watching Paint Dry Weekly', you might get more of an adrenaline kick out of it! 0.5 out of ten!"

","WARNING! THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS! IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE DO NOT READ THIS AS IT WILL RUIN THE MOVIE EXPERIENCE. Not that ""Revolutions"" is much of an experience, it's actually a waste of time and money, but you might want to see with your own eyes this ""masterpiece"". Actually I hope that as many people as possible see it so that they will know what I'm talking about when I say that it's a disgrace to the Matrix 1, and even to the second.<br/><br/>The conclusion of the Matrix saga has to be one of the biggest disappointments of all times, all in all a really bad sequel. After the brilliant Matrix first movie, ""Matrix Reloaded"" wasn't as good and ""Matrix: Revolutions"" is a perfect example of how writers that run out of ideas just play on the success of their previous works. This movie is so full of cliches it makes you sick! Fans of the series were expecting a blockbuster ending to the story and they got nothing. This movie belongs in the bottom 100 of the IMDb list and it will get there, as more and more people see it and are disappointed by it. The storyline is so weak and the exaggerated use of special effects that were supposed to paint the picture of the final battle between humans and machines do nothing but stir up laughter. The sentinels that just keep on coming and coming were too much. How many sentinels can there be anyway? They overdid it with the ""war to end all wars"" idea. The thing that made me want to walk out of the cinema is near the end. Neo is in a hurry to get to the machine city and stop the war before Zion is completely destroyed and when Trinity gets hurt, she just doesn't die faster! I mean, the man has only a little time left to save humanity and she just keeps telling him about love and other stuff and she takes her time about it. It's like: ""Wait... I'm dieing... oh, no... not yet... I have to tell you about this and that... it's all getting dark... but there's still something to say...""! Lame! Exaggerated. I'm sorry if I strike as too aggressive, but as a fan I considered this an offense to the original Matrix and an offense to all the people that said after seeing it: ""It really makes you think. Is this really the world, or just a dream?"". Real fans, you know that this is an awful movie in comparison with the first and even on its own."
"fromwithin","4","130","269","3 April 2004"," Success breeds 'yes' men.
","The Matrix:Reloaded was good. Not as good as I would have liked, but good nevertheless. Revolutions was unfortunately many degrees below that standard. The feeling I got throughout the entire film was that the Wachowski's had the phrase ""wouldn't it be cool if..."" on their minds, and due to the success of the first film, nobody would stand up to them and say that, well, actually, it would be pretty cheesy. There are so many scenes that are just awful cliched nonsense. I hope that in ten years time, as happened with the Highlander series, somebody will come along and pretend that these original sequels never existed and create some new ones following on from the first film.<br/><br/>Too many characters with too little substance. Scenes based on effects instead of story, characters based on ability rather than being interesting. A pile of rubbish really."
"ruethewhirl","1","65","128","8 November 2003"," Nothing new, nothing revolutionary.
","Within the first ten minutes of this film it seemed that Revolutions wasn't going to be the redemption of Matrix Reloaded I had hoped for.  The cod-philosophy was back with a vengeance but within even less substance then the supposed profound musings of the previous films while the first few action scenes seemed crudely tacked on set-pieces used as weak attempts to move between the poor-excuses for plot devices.  As the film progresses it gives a disproportionate amount of focus on secondary characters with whom we have little-to-no attachment to, unless of course you have succumbed to the cynical cash-in ploys of the Animatrix and the Enter The Matrix computer game, but even then their backstories are less than fascinating and add little to the film.  It is as if the Wachowski brothers have run out of ideas for the main characters, who, without the fast-paced world of the matrix to play with, reveal themselves as increasingly 2-dimensional, only defined by each one's singular purpose - i.e. Morpheus' faith in Neo as saviour, Trinity's love for Neo, or Neo simply being Neo, the all-asskicking super-dude we all secretly wish and/or think we might be.  The Wachowski brothers appear to be introducing as many other (also 2-dimensional) characters as possible into the fray in order to distract us from the poor development of the series' central characters.   What we are left with is an onslaught of scenes with characters in peril which we ultimately don't care about, and that do not make for exciting viewing.  In fact, I personally was looking forward to the potential deaths of certain of the Zion-based characters rather than fearing their demise, notably ""The Kid"" of Animatrix fame and the Captain who's main role in the film is to shout ""Aaaargh!"" while firing large guns (I won't tell you whether either of them actually do get it or not).  Neo and Trinity are given little screen-time for the bulk of the film as they go about their separate mission while Morpheus literally takes a backseat to Niobe, a character for which we care little for unless we have been lining the Wachowski brother's pockets further by buying Enter The Matrix.<br/><br/>The action scenes themselves can err the viewer towards boredom - there's only so much interest or fear to be gleaned from admittedly well-crafted but still obviously CG creations.  The sheer scale of the employment of CG creations in Zion unfortunately makes the whole battle seem too fake to be truly involving.  Much of the film is not unlike watching a friend playing on his X-box but not being given a turn yourself.<br/><br/>The film's attempts at plot hinge on the themes of love, death and perhaps even a slightly Jungian themed idea on the dichotomy of the self in terms or Neo and Agent Smith's relationship to one another and the inception of a twisted humanity into the program, Smith, who's menacing role is inevitably driven towards a pantomime villain styled performance.  The love theme is somewhat overplayed and seemingly without anything to say other than ""Love's great, isn't it?"" while we are yet to see really why there is any love between the dull, lifeless characters of Trinity or Neo.  The climax of their love in this film is embarrassingly acted and overlong, releasing a few laughs from the more cynical of us in the cinema.  Moreover, the much anticipated answers to the looming questions of the second film and the conclusion of the series are glossed over with vague dialogue masquerading as profound sentiment, ultimately leaving the viewer to come up with their own explanations as the Wachowski brother's appear incapable of doing so themselves.  Oh, and they never do explain why Neo's intra-matrix powers have deteriorated from the first film (where he ultimately became capable of rising from the dead to invade and destroy the agent programs from inside) into merely being a better-dressed version of Superman.  The questions of free-will and metaphysical freedom touched upon in the first film are largely ignored in favour of a simple fight for survival against the evil machines invading Zion and Neo's battle with the cyber-bogeyman that is Agent Smith instead of the potential for a psychic/psychological battle with the matrix program itself - a potential for a mindblowing effects-fest if ever there was.<br/><br/>All in all the concluding part of the Matrix trilogy comes over as a bloated, overlong ending tacked on to reloaded with few to zero new ideas, less engaging action scenes and an ending that may well have been conceived on the back of an envelope while on the way to work.  The brothers did a masterful job of melding science fiction, comic and anime influences into a thoroughly entertaining, ground-breaking and thoughtful film in the original Matrix but have stretched the concept too far in a quest for a bigger bank balance. Although kids with a short attention span may well find the blaring gunfire and many explosions of Revolutions appealing they were much more entertaining when more firmly routed in the artificial world of the Matrix itself.  Upon leaving the cinema the thought I was left with was whether the real matrix controlling and shaping what we think is that of the dumbed-down entertainment industry, force-feeding us brainless, unimaginative films to pacify our minds."
"Orgazmo","1","44","84","29 November 2003"," Yes, I understood it. Yes, it was bad.
","I don't care what you learned in your Philosophy courses, this movie wasn't any good. I don't say this because it was ""too deep,"" because it wasn't, I say this because it was a film that failed miserably at everything it set out to do.<br/><br/>First off, the battle for Zion.  This would have been interesting, had it not been a case of a bunch of minor characters being the focal point. Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are the central characters of this film, and they were nowhere to be found in what was supposed to the biggest action scene. While the concept was cool, it just came off as watching some kid you don't know at an arcade play video games. Sure, some of the stuff is neat, but there's no emotional attachment. I could have also done without this battle including every single war movie cliche ever.  The momment I saw the kid tip his cart over, I knew exactly what was going to happen, and I was correct. Not because I'm smart, but because I've seen it done in dozens of other movies.<br/><br/>Then we get to the script.  Here is an excerpt, more or less:<br/><br/>NEO: What am I supposed to do? ORACLE: You know what you're supposed to do. NEO: Ok. ORACLE: By the way, I'm a different actress, I better explain that every time I'm on screen.<br/><br/>This goes on for about 20 minutes or so and makes you want to put your lip over your head and suck your eyeballs out of the sockets.  In fact, I'd say that a good 60% of the script consists of characters saying ""You know what you need to do"" ""You know the answer"" ""When the time comes, you'll know."" This is fine in a comic book or a novel, where we know a character's thoughts, and there's room for introspection, but on film it just doesn't work. Screenwriting 101, people.<br/><br/>Also, when did they replace the actors with wax statues? Keanu is Keanu, but even since Reloaded, the acting seemed to drop off.  I've always thought that Morpheus was the most interesting character in Martix lore, and Larry Fishburne usually is a high point of the movies, but he sleepwalked through this one, mailed in every line and had a look on his face that seemed to say ""I really don't wanna do this any more."" This is probably due to the fact that they really didn't give any of the principal characters anything important or interesting to do. Morpehus was relegated to playing second banana to Niobi, which pretty much was a total betrayal of his character. The same guy who gave a speech to fire up Zion is now just sitting around being yelled at?<br/><br/>As for the philosophy stuff, there wasn't all that much in this one, which was one of the positives, because if I had to sit through another half hour speech about causality, I'd declare holy war on france.  But not to fear, this one's chock full of religious symbolism.  If you never made the connection that Neo was supposed to be Christ, well.. this movie will not only make that clear, they will beat you over the head with it, to the point where a cross actually appears on Neo's chest, and he's dragged off while in a crucifix position.  Why not just end the movie with 100 years later everyone celebrating a holiday called ""Neomas?""  Despite all the Matrix fans who say that this is a film designed to ""deprogram"" people and ""open minds,"" and all the Matrix fans I met who bash christianity, this is a pretty pro-christian movie.<br/><br/>When I first saw the Revolutions trailer, I said ""This fight between Smith and Neo had better be the best throwdown ever caught on film.""  Well, it wasn't.  Now, I'm not gonna go on a tirade about the CGI, because even though it looks like The Sims fighting, that's what you expect in the Matrix series.  My problem is how on a whole, the fight was just pretty un-interesting.  It's basiclly like watching Dragonball Z. Stuff blows up, they punch each other through buildings and fly around.  The problem simply is that the first Matrix was so innovative, they just were unable to top themselves, no matter how hard they tried. It just seemed like everything they did in terms of action and fights was just... old.  They even just redo the lobby fight from the first film, except this time the bad guys are on the ceiling.<br/><br/>As for the ending, I wasn't as angry about it as some other people were. I can see why it ended that way, and I think in a way you have to respect the risk that went with ending the trilogy like they did.<br/><br/>This movie seemed like it was running on fumes, and that ultimatly was the failure.  I think that if they had not shot Reloaded and Revolutions back to back, if they had time to say ""What worked in Revolutions?"" before they did the third, they would have been able to come up with something better. But alas, they ended up with what will most likely prove to be one of the most disapointing films of all time.  And worse even is the fact that Reloaded and Revolutions take away from the original. I tried watching Matrix the other day, and it just wasn't as good now that I know the full story and most of the disapointing answers to the questions asked in the original.<br/><br/>So those are my problems with the movis, but I've got one other problem pertaining to Matrix Revolutions.  I'm pretty sick of the main defense of this movie being ""You didn't understand it!"" or ""You had too many expectations!""  Please.  The movie is flawed, horribly flawed.  Just because it has ""The Matrix"" in the title, doesn't mean it's good.  It's ok to dislike this film, you can still call yourself a matrix fan. Heck, I hate Rocky V, but I still call myself a fan of the Rocky movies. If you loved it, great, that's ok.  But if you realized that it's not good, don't grasp at straws trying to prove to yourself that you liked it, I'm sure your compatriots over in the mIRC Matrix Chatroom will love you nonetheless.<br/><br/>Also, you really dont have to be a rocket scientist to understand the Matrix Trilogy. We're not dealing with 8 1/2 here. So if you wanna respond to someone who didn't like this movie, don't play the ""I'm smarter than you because I liked this"" card, because that's just silly... it's a movie, not a way of life (if you think it's a way of life, please get help immediatly.)<br/><br/>So before you're about to call someone a mental midget for daring to dislike a Matrix film.. just think: What would Jesu...err...Neo do?"

","The Matrix Revolutions brings the mind blowing trilogy to an end. For some, it brought resolution, for others not. Whether or not you are a fan of the Matrix series the most important attribute to Revolutions is being able to understand it. No doubt the effects, albeit stunning, cannot save the Matrix, as we learned in Reloaded. This time around the acting and dialog was infinitely better, however, even these redeeming factors don't fill the gap completely. I loved this film, more than previous two - and is one of my favorites of all time, for that matter - but it's mostly accredited to the fact that I understand what happened in Revolutions. I'm not out to spoil it for anyone, but I have met more than enough of others who have seen this film and don't understand it, as well as do, to see that those who find Revolutions to be nothing but enigmatic hate the film more than all of the three. Consequently, those who have a grasp on what happened enjoyed the experience as much as I did and feel the same way I do.<br/><br/>The Wachowski brothers, perhaps, could have portrayed the finale with a little more clarity; but I find it ashame that so many have come to hate this trilogy upon seeing Revolutions. It goes to show how important it is to pay attention to the little details we sometimes disregard in such an action-oriented trilogy as the Matrix. There really is more to it. And once you understand the film, you get to love the rest of it: the action, the characters, the story, even more. 9/10"

Back in the real world, Zion is under attack from the sentinels, Neo decides that he must travel into the machine city and confront the creator of the matrix while Niobe pilots the remaining ship back to Zion to take on the sentinels.<br/><br/>I love the original Matrix, but can't help feel that the 2 overblown, over serious sequels have damaged it.  This film works a little better than the second sequel but not by much.  Where Reloaded left us with unanswered questions, Revolutions offers us the answers.  Sadly the ""answers"" just left me confused and bewildered.  I didn't feel like the film even tried to explain what was going on, and the ending came about far too suddenly and with little explanation.  I know that a film is good if it leaves you thinking about things and I could sort of guess that Neo might have become some sort of programme etc at the end, but I still felt that the film should have helped me out even a little bit!<br/><br/>The plot is very heavy going and it lacks the light imagination evident in the first film.  This really sucks the fun out of the film and makes it hard work - I have nothing against it being thought provoking and requiring thought, but it all seemed very laboured to me.  The opening hour is quite hard work and the whole ""train station"" thing is never really explained and just seems designed to fill time or something.  The action all looks great - the attack on Zion is visually very impressive and is quite exciting. However some fight scenes are so overblown that they failed to inspire.  The shootout in the check room of the club is simply a tired retread of the groundbreaking lobby shootout but it is the final fight with Smith that shows what I mean.  Neo's showdown with Smith in the first film was great fun and very exciting.  Here (and in Reloaded) it is an excess of special effects, horribly overblown - visually impressive but not enjoyable.<br/><br/>The film seems to have taken on the mantel of ""meaningful epic"" where once it was a clever film with no assumptions.  Listen to the music - that's where the clue is.  Instead of the rock mix from the first film it has taken on big sweeping classical pieces that it scatters around liberally to try and give the film an epic feel that it doesn't deserve.  It is still worth seeing as it finishes the trilogy but it is hard work at times.  The acting continues the curse of Reloaded in that everyone thinks they are reading Shakespeare and gives their performance as if they were speaking words direct from God.  Even Weaving's Smith is a little too full of himself this time.  The dialogue is pretty bad as before - full of clichés and over wordy speeches of grandeur, it just gets tiresome before it gets engaging.<br/><br/>In the first film we were told no one can be told what the matrix is, we must see it for ourselves.  We were then taken on a journey (with Neo), led by Morpheus into this world that was explained as we went.  Here we are simply dumped in the middle of an impenetrable plot and basically left to work things out for ourselves with little or no help.  Attempts to have characters like the Architect or the Oracle explain things are simply clunky and don't work at all. I'm not adverse to thinking, but the more I think about the film as a series the more i see unanswered holes.  I was hoping that Revolutions would tie things up from Reloaded and actually serve to make part 2 work better, but it didn't.  It took some positive steps but really the same weaknesses just continue.<br/><br/>Overall I was glad I saw it to finish the story, and visually it had some very impressive moments.  However the feeling was of a film with no controls, spiralling out of control - with narrative flow lost behind half ideas and spiritual nonsense.  It is over indulgent, bloated and full of a sense of it's own importance - an importance it simply does not have and should not be wearing on it's sleeve.  The Wachowski's created a fascinating universe but, as they opened it out, their egos have inflated the material and their inability to control and tell such a massive story has shown and the last 2 films have really suffered as a result.  Worth watching for what it attempts to do, but ultimately very frustrating for what it actually delivers and, more importantly, what it fails totally to do."

","Despite some awful critics, I have to say that this movie was more than I expected. What most people that didn't like it criticized was that the movie left some story arcs unanswered, but this in fact was something to be praised.<br/><br/>The movie didn't give all the answers, but rather left the foundations for the audience to think, analyze an decide them. That's how there are so many interpretations to it, it has so many layers that it would take more than just one good chat to understand all the meanings of the matrix.<br/><br/>This third installment didn't have more kung fu, or philosophical speech than the first two, it rather had more symbolisms throughout not only the actions and reactions of the characters but also through  the concepts used.<br/><br/>Something people should consider  is that according to Joel Silver, Reloaded and Revolutions are the same movie cut in half, which gives a different perspective to Revolutions if only analyzed alone.<br/><br/>This movie is about an end, death, finding a meaning for life, fighting, truth, etc. But it is not a movie about conclusion. The answers given in Revolutions lead to more questions because in the end it is about believing rather than knowing (reading between lines that is one of the may messages of the movie). After all, if you knew everything, what would be the point?<br/><br/>Revolutions also has some incredible special effects scenes and sound. The lightening is superb along with all the technical aspects of the film. The CGI doesn't look as exaggerated as in Reloaded (it's better executed).<br/><br/>The only complain I have is that the chemistry between Neo and Trinity is a little lacking. The story arc is well resolved, but I don't know if it was a matter of the actors or the directors that the chemistry is just not felt.<br/><br/>In the end I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10"
"les_kinky","10","13","22","6 November 2003"," Was enthralled throughout. (SPOILERS)
","No part of this 130 minute movie was either boring or confusing. The whole thing held a load of meaning and the story was rich. The action was spectacular, and editing was where it should be. The amount of screen time for the characters was appropriate, the acting was okay, Hugo Weaving was excellent. Fight choreography was top notch, special effects are best you can get at the moment, music score goes down as a favorite.<br/><br/>This is a movie to see, it is part three of three of a popular mainstream movie series ending satisfactorily with this installment, Matrix: Revolutions. In saying that, I would like to comment on the bad feedback. All those who said it lacked story, well remember, it is part three. Consider all three movies, three acts of one story. No, don't consider, know that to be the case! This remember is half of a 4 1/2 hour movie, so put Reloaded and revolutions together, you get one story narrative, add Matrix to the front of that, you get over six hours of action, story and drama, all ending in a big action packed final.<br/><br/>To the home made critics and pro's, it ended how it ended and could not have ended any other way! People were expecting everything to come together at the end, from Persiphone to the train man to the twins, who by the way are dead! No, that is not the driving force of these trilogies, but it is too end the war against the machines! We find out that Smith is Neos negative, created by the matrix to balance the equation of the programming. We find out why neo stopped those Sentinals mid air, he had touched the source when he was with the Architect and is now connected with the machine systems! What more do you want. The merovingian is a powerful program in the system, he is merely trying to destroy the oracle, (reason unknown and not necissary)and just wants to create trouble.<br/><br/>The war ends with Neo making peace and cleansing the matrix of Smith, letting him infect Neo, who now is connected directly with the machine city, and is able to delete smith. Neo had to sacrifice himself for everything.<br/><br/>In the end it was satisfying, it is fun and exciting, thought-provoking and emotional, just like the original. In fact the first matrix is exactly like this movie, it is just not fresh anymore which affects our expectations. This movie is as deep, so deep many don't understand and misinterpret the fact, this move is like life. When in life is all our problems or mysteries solved? We don't have to like everything in life, but the main thing is, we must try to enjoy it!"

","I liked the movie because there was more action than explaining comparing to Reloaded. I really liked dramatic scene where people of Zion fought against machines. Of course there's lot of philosophy to find other weird things for example how Neo killed Smith -program and how he can destroy machines easily in the real world. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad when the movie doesn't explain some scenes for example how/why Seraph survived when he was with The Oracle. At least it gives freedom to figure it out by yourself.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie not only to Matrix -fans but also to people who like movies where a strong faith in something wins the sense and impossible becomes possible."

","i was worried about how i would feel about this movie after seeing all the negative reviews but i think the negative reviews come from two perspectives; 1) people who only like the matrix for the hong kong style fight sequences, and 2) people who can't follow the movie or don't like the fact that it is not self-contained like the first one.<br/><br/>i'll try not to spoil anything for people who haven't seen it.  for me the ending of a movie (or series of movies) is crucial, and if i feel that the ending is weak i can't really like the movie.  so like i said i was worried, but i was very happy with the way the storyline was resolved.  some of the machine action sequences or battle scenes or whatever didn't do so much for me, but that storyline was fairly necessary for the movie.<br/><br/>all in all i am really looking forward to seeing what the wachowski brothers do next.  i really like the philosophical/psychological elements in their films and would really be interested in seeing what they could do with a movie that didn't require so much action and special effects.  but i do hope that they might consider going back to some of these characters and telling us more about them.  i love the implications of the sati character and would love to see more of the merovingian and persephone.  and who could ever get enough of agent smith?<br/><br/>the matrix: 9.5, reloaded: 8 (mostly for the weakness of the first 40 minutes), and revolutions: 9 (for being too dependent on the machine action/battle sequences).  it's been a wonderful trip."
"awhoughton","2","33","66","18 August 2005"," A pointless, incompetent, incoherent mess of a movie.
","Watched Matrix Revolutions last night and then watched the original Matrix tonight... The contrast was incredible. The Matrix had a great idea and turned it into one of the best B-movies of all time with great production values.<br/><br/>Matrix Revolutions, however, was thin, watery gruel by comparison. The so called plot wandered and dropped into long periods of pointless action or pointless filler. It could have used a great editing job that shortened it by at least 30 minutes.<br/><br/>In all ways this movie was lacking when compared to the first movie - the writing was sloppy, the characters and dialogue well-worn and one-dimensional, the computer graphics looked ""mailed-in"" as if they thought that spending a lot of money on computer animation could make up for not doing their design work correctly, and the pacing was inconsistent and irritating.<br/><br/>Additionally, the devices they used, the tools the people of Zion created were ludicrous. Why invent huge walking robots that were unnecessarily complex, completely without armor and required people to run back in forth to reload them. Gee, I guess they had a really unscrupulous defense industry to sell them garbage like that.<br/><br/>But even then, where was this movie taking us anyway? What we thought might be a resolution was nothing more than an incoherent cop-out at the end. If Neo was the ""One"" why didn't he get the victory they envisioned in the Original Matrix? It looked more like an uneasy armistice to me.<br/><br/>The most unfortunate aspect of this movie is that it is a discredit to the original. Whereas the creators had a chance build on an incredible beginning, they chose instead to take their Hollywood money and wasted it on this pointless, incoherent mess of a movie."

","The Matrix Revolutions: 4 out of 10: The Matrix Revolutions concludes the Matrix trilogy with an ending no-one remembers due to years of intensive therapy. Despite the ending, it is slightly less irritating than The Matrix Reloaded. Partially because that previous film had lowered the bar so much and crushed our dreams so thoroughly that we were mere empty husks by the time this film hit theaters.<br/><br/>The Good: Look, it could have been worse. Neo might have found out he got his powers through the scientific miracle of Midi-chlorians, Neo could have spun the earth backward to reverse time and bring Lois Lane back to life, or Alex Winter could have shown up in a time-traveling phone booth and whisked Neo back to San Dimas, California to give a report to his Philosophy class about Determinism, choice, and the works of Jean Baudrillard before heading to the club for a radical Wyld Stallyns concert which plays over the closing credits. Okay, that would be the best ending ever.<br/><br/>The Bad: Alas There is no Wyld Stallyns concert at the end of The Matrix Revolutions. To no one's surprise, there is a fight with Agent Smith as predictable as Rocky vs. Drago in Rocky IV. I am half surprised the cloned Smith crowd didn't start chanting Neo Neo as the fight came to its conclusion.<br/><br/>There is a lot of talking in The Matrix Revolutions so let me see if I can break down the plot. Everything is predetermined; there is no choice; Neo is Jesus with Superman powers, and in a running time of over two hours there is one decent action scene with none of the main characters involved in it.<br/><br/>The decent action scene is the machines attack on Zion. All Zion has is those walkers like in Aliens but with machine guns attached and a couple of scrappy lesbians with a missile launcher. It does not go well for them.<br/><br/>Zion also has a ton of new characters that I don't care about. They all seem to have the personality of wet toast. The two exceptions are the irritatingly scrappy child soldier who almost saves the day and Commander Lock played by Harry Lennix who hates everyone and everything and is missing his calling to be the Lieutenant in the new Die Hard who thinks John McClane is working with the terrorists. You are supposed to hate Commander Lock, but at least he had a personality. (In Reloaded my favorite character by far was The Merovingian another person you are supposed to hate.)<br/><br/>At a critical part of the battle, one of the hovercrafts is rushing back to set off an EMP to destroy the machines. Which brings me to the first question? Why doesn't Zion have EMPs? Like lots of them? EMPs only affect machines with a live current running through them so you could power down, kill the evil machines, and power up again. There is no explanation given for any of this.<br/><br/>There are a lot of questions generated by The Matrix Revolutions. Why are people surprised that Agent Smith can replicate himself? He is a computer program. Its what they do.<br/><br/>If your actress playing the Oracle dies, why hire a new actress that almost looks like her? Why not have the Oracle played by someone completely different to emphasize the fact she is just a computer program as well. I would have had Joe Pantoliano take up the role. That would have woken up both the audience and the crew of Nebuchadnezzar.<br/><br/>If someone gets stabbed by four large pieces of rebar, would they really be up for a four-minute speech?<br/><br/>Ian Bliss does a great job as a crewmember possessed by Agent Smith. He does such a good job he might as well wear a T-shirt that says I am Agent Smith ask me how. The reaction of Neo and company to this obviously enthralled crewmate breaks all sorts of reality. (When Neo finds out he can use his powers outside the Matrix one of his first thought should have been could his opponents do so as well?)<br/><br/>I could go on ( computer programs that believe in love, Zion has a city council that is larger than its army, machines turning into either the Baby Face mask from Brazil or the final boss from Mass Effect 2 so they can speak to Neo.) but the biggest issue is one spends the movie thinking about these things instead of enjoying the spectacle on screen. Partially because for so much of its running time The Matrix Revolutions says rather than shows.<br/><br/>The Ugly: The Merovingian played by Lambert Wilson and his wife Persephone played by Monica Bellucci are by far the most exciting things in The Matrix Reloaded, and while that movie dropped the ball a bit, they promised great things in the sequel. Instead, we get one scene in a bondage dance club called Hel (Another Mass Effect 2 reference? Could the Wachowski siblings be secret Commander Shephard fans?), and Monica Bellucci only gets one line for the love of all that is holy. (On the plus side costume designer Kym Barrett brought her A game.)<br/><br/>Speaking of the club Hel according to IMDb Craig Walker played Hel Club Pony Girl Trainer but was uncredited. Can you imagine the embarrassment for Craig as he is sitting in the theater as the credits roll and his nan is asking him why his name isn't on the screen?<br/><br/>I said a lot in my reviews of The Matrix and particularly Matrix Reloaded about how having your main character be a Superman is kryptonite for tension and excitement. Matrix Revolutions does not solve this problem, and if anything, it is worse. Also, the religious allegories are more than a bit on the nose, and this is from a movie series where the main love interest is named Trinity.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: Matrix Revolutions is less frustrating than the Matrix Reloaded simply because it doesn't have as much goodwill to squander. Fans of some long-running TV shows certainly know the feeling where you think ""How are they going to pull this off?"", and they don't. The Matrix was a great stand-alone film, and the two sequels managed to destroy a perfectly fine story. If you see them, that is. The best thing to do is to pretend they do not exist. It is like watching Game of Thrones but stopping at the end of season six."

There's alot going on in this finale and rightly so! There are some things I didn't like, one being that Morpheus who has been the leader of the resistance all of a sudden is a commander with no ship taking orders from Roland!

","While Reloaded may have been simply a disappointing sequel, substituting story and originality with gonzo effects and 'coolness' so beloved in the first film, this film is a spectacular disaster. it is horrible on so many levels. The music in reloaded was derivative and lacked the energy of the first, but this film's music was just flat out bad. As in like annoyingly bad. Like I wanted to shoot somebody bad.<br/><br/>The 'plot' is pretty non-existent and the film takes place mostly in the 'real world' and doesn't even involve the main characters. It's as if Keanu, Carrie-Ann and Lawrence filmed this around their golf schedule. well over half the movie focuses on minor characters who lack personality or development and none of whom we care one iota about. The film is so bad it even resorts to using the horrid cliché of the bumbling young recruit saving the day.<br/><br/>I would rank the film as ""horrible"" if just for not answering a single question posed by Reloaded, however, the abysmal storyline, acting, music, editing and dismissal of main characters make it impossible for me to rate this film anything over a 2 out of 10 (and those 2 points are solely for a couple of impressive effects shots). This film is an F in every way, as bad and laughable as cinematic catastrophes like Battlefield: Earth or Showgirls.<br/><br/>Perhaps the Wachowski's were truly just 2-hit wonders (Bound & the Matrix) and after that have nothing left to say."
"marcosr","Null","34","70","9 November 2003"," The Matrix > Revolutions >>>>>>>>Reloaded
","I never saw The Matrix on the big screen, in fact I had never heard of it till it came out on DVD. I watched it and was amazed. Such a unique take on a familiar concept (Dark City anyone?). New and fantastic special effects and good flowing and thought provoking dialogue. This was surely a film that the filmmakers could see as risky, since all the special effects were groundbreaking and cost so much. Adding to the problems was that it starred Mr. Whoa!, Keanu Reeves, who I feel has never proven himself a strong lead in any role. In sense I could tell they were holding back what they were capable of, mostly due to lack of money. In time The Matrix became a huge success and the Wachoski's had all the money they would ever need. With the money came the possibilities of a sequel. (it seems these days that if any film makes enough money that it deserves a sequel.) Well the ideas started brewing and soon Reloaded and Revolutions were announced and then filmed back to back.<br/><br/>I went into Reloaded with really high expectations. My expectations were so high based on the possibilities The Matrix left us with and where the story could go from there.. Boy was I let down. The negative definitely outweighed the bad in Reloaded. The editing, the pacing, the dialouge, and the acting, all horrendous. The only saving graces of Reloaded are two action sequences, Neo vs. The Merovingian's henchman and the freeway chase. The burly brawl was cool, but not needed and overdone. It seemed to be filmed only to make the fanboys cream thier pants. Overall a slow and pointless transition for the trilogy. Pointless, only because none of the questions asked in it are answered in Revolutions.<br/><br/>Revolutions on its own is good film. It doesnt quite fit into the trilogy, but considering Reloaded, that is a good thing. It's nowhere near as good or wonderous as The Matrix, but it has it's own sense of wonder. We finally get to see the scorched remains of the earth. We see how populated the machine world actually is and what it looks like. The first twenty minutes or so are just filler and confusion that leaked over from Reloaded. Once the main conflict gets started, the film really grows on its own. The defending of the dock in Zion was incredible, some people have said it's overdone, I disagree. The attack is massive and it needed to be. I was just in awe at the swarms of squids streaming in. The people of Zion knew it was hopeless, yet they fought on.<br/><br/>Neo vs. Smith, probably the one moment in film I have been anticipating all year. Was it cool? Yes. Was it necessary? Probably not. It was a combination of the subway fight and the burly brawl. I couldn't help but laugh a bit as these two unstoppable forces beat the crap out of each other in each overly exaggerated shot. Have you ever wondered what a fist looks like flying toward a face in pouring rain? Well Revolutions shows you.<br/><br/>This film worked for me because all the stuff that was pounded into us in Reloaded was dropped. All the philosophy is gone, for the most part. The ending itself is a bit anti-climatic, too happy and sequel fodder. Why can't films just end anymore? Why do filmakers insist on leaving open possiblities for sequels? I just don't get it. The Matrix Reloaded was a dark, violent and sometimes over the top action movie. I bought it and I liked it.<br/><br/>And to those of you who haven't heard of or seen Dark City. Go see it and watch a much better movie than The Matrix that has almost the exact same concept.<br/><br/>***/*****"

Let the whole trilogy sink in and it will all make perfect sense. The fight scenes are just as good as ever, but the battle on Zion was a little long and sometimes repetitive. It did feature some great action, though. There are plenty of tense moments and some unforeseen events that will catch you off guard. Hugo Weaving does the best job and plays the coolest character in the entire trilogy in Agent Smith and his many, many clones. This movie is very good but the original Matrix is still my favorite.

This movie expects you to care about the world and these characters when it seems like there's no point. That being said, the plot is terrible.

","Horrendous! I want my seven Euro back. This movie was the death blow to what the good idea that was half-beaten to death by the ""Matrix: Reloaded."" After that second movie with it's unnecessary first hour of footage, the ""Matrix: Revolutions"" finally destroyed all hope of resurrecting the revolutionary (no pun intended) 1999 film, the ""Matrix.""<br/><br/> Where to begin? I suppose, first of all, dialogue. Cheap, trite philosophy from Keanu Reeves? No thanks. Uninspired speeches given to men going to battle robots that can swim through air with no sort of propulsion apparatus? No thanks. Insincere, hokey love duet between Keanu and Carrie-Anne Moss? No, no, no. Why did he bring her back in the second one? To spite me?<br/><br/> To quote a friend of mine, ""I have seen this thing in other movies ... it's called acting, and it just wasn't in [the ""Matrix: Revolutions""] at all."" Now, though I want to agree with this, is a little unfair. Hugo Weaving acted quite well, as usual, but the lack of acting skills from nearly everyone he interacted with made him appear to overact at times. Sorry, Hugo.<br/><br/> Also, although I realize some of the following examples will be stretches, but I feel I must mention them, there are the rip-off scenes. First, the same friend who commented above also said that he appreciated the scene where Jada Pinkett Smith flew the ship (or whatever) into Zion and EMP'ed all the robots more when it was the Millennium Falcon escaping the Death Star.  Sorry, Will, your wife just isn't Billy Dee Williams. Oh yeah, Ben Affleck from ""Daredevil"" called for you Keanu, he wants his superpower back. To put Agent Smith in a human body only to get killed after he accomplished next to nothing in it ... great idea Wachowskis. And the mech robot thingies... seemed stolen from ""Aliens."" I know that's a bit of a stretch, but if I imagine a military version of the cargo loader that Sigourney Weaver fights the Queen Alien in, it would be one of those. Plus, that speech Captain Whoever gave before the battle seemed like a cross between ""Patton"" but dumbed down to ""Independence Day"" proportions. And the whole of the movie that happened outside of the ""matrix"" (which really only began in the second film) has always seemed to me a rip-off of the man vs. machine war that started in ""Terminator,"" only the machines are more modernized with special effects.<br/><br/> Also, this film tossed in a bunch of incredibly useless extra characters like the Trainman and Sati and her parents. I say these are useless because Morpheus and Trinity go to see Merovingian and Persephone in an encounter which lasts about five minutes. In fact, I believe Monica Bellucci's cameo was merely to point out that she has an ample bosom as her one line was utterly meaningless. The new extra characters detracted from the old ones and the old ones just seemed tossed into the script. Ugh!<br/><br/> To the Wachowskis, great idea with the first one guys, but when you expanded the world of the matrix, you bit off more than you could chew. The entirety of the trilogy should have been contained within the matrix in a fight to free the minds of all the other humans or something, but the Zion, machine world, and the Matrix was just too much to handle in three movies. Also, if you guys want to philosophize in that manner, go to a Star Trek convention or brush up on your Kant and Rousseau first. Seriously.<br/><br/> Conclusion: I recommend seeing this movie only if it's raining and you've watched every one of the movies you own six times or more and this just happens to be available.

","No spoilers here, and I'm not going to get into the philosophy, hidden meaning or anything else like that here...
To judge this film, or any of the three films as something that you should 'get' as a stand alone movie is ridiculous. Yes the first movie can be viewed this way and justly deserves a strong rating. The Matrix introduces the story, the characters, the premise and concludes at a pretty natural break in the overall storyline. To that end Reloaded introduces more characters and develops the story further. However if you need the third movie of a trilogy to introduce more, and not be dedicated to the conclusion of the story then you should love Godfather III.<br/><br/>So what is there to 'get'? There is much that you can understand about the making of these movies prior to ever watching the movies that will help immensely in my humble opinion. First the Wachowski's directorial debut was Bound with a whopping budget of 5mil, then on to Matrix at 65mil, and from there to Reloaded and Revolutions at a combined 300mil! I have read 2 versions of this. What is the same in both is the they wrote the entire Matrix trilogy as one story and wanted to sell it that way to a studio. The difference in the two stories is what their motivation for Bound was. One version has it as an audition to the studio for funding the Matrix, the other is that it was not. Regardless it was filmed in the 38 days largely because of the Wachowski's extensive planning and clear vision for the film. This is one thing for Bound, but quite another when you consider they did the same thing for the Matrix trilogy. They story boarded all the scenes for the trilogy once they started the production of the Matrix. They had all three movies made in their heads, down to how every scene looked prior to ever starting them. Further, if the technology did not exist to put on film what was in their head, then they just went ahead and created that also.<br/><br/>I highly recommend these films be watched in a 'marathon' fashion, but what I would recommend even more is that you start with Matrix Revisited, to see the journey you are about to go on."

","I went to see Matrix: Revolutions, hoping that there would be some explanation as to why Neo was able to kill machines in the realy-real world. Unfortunately, Matrix: Revolutions has no answers, only many more questions.  Why the Wachowski Brothers turned the third (and hopefully final) saga of the Matrix, into a emotionless, plot-lacking, ridiculous battle against the machines, that the humans could never hope to win, I will never know.  After seeing the movie I have no doubts that the question we all ask ourselves at night will be:<br/><br/>What is the Matrix Revolutions?<br/><br/>Much like Morpheus I will only tell you the truth...<br/><br/>#$%! covered in tin foil."
"MovieAddict2016","4","21","43","23 December 2005"," It's as if they were purposefully TRYING to make it as bad as possible
","I'm no ""Matrix"" nut, but the first one was okay, and the second was different (if extremely pretentious). ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is an amalgamation of all the flaws of the previous two films with none of the positive attributes. It continues to focus upon the efforts of the Zion underground, scenes which are so hopeless and laughable they make the rave party in ""Reloaded"" look dignified. The final ""battle"" between Neo and Agent Smith is perhaps the most anti-climactic finale in any movie ever made.<br/><br/>Some people have come to the film's defense. They've tried to imply it's an intellectual film - which is a rarity - and people who cannot appreciate this are too accustomed to MTV.<br/><br/>Look, the Wachowski Brothers dropped out of high school, okay. They admitted that they borrowed many different themes from religions and philosophies for the first film. The thing is, they could get away with slight references in the original because the original was an action film. References don't need to be expanded upon. ""Matrix Revolutions"" tries to talk to us - and it fails, because the Wachowskis are not brilliant thinkers, and their attempts at writing a script packed with philosophical mumbo-jumbo is laughable at best. It's being talked down to by an intellectual inferior, and it's painful.<br/><br/>The action scenes - and there are a good number, don't get me wrong - pale in comparison to ""Reloaded."" They just aren't nearly as entertaining.<br/><br/>The ending is terrible. And the scene with the girl and the Oracle on the park bench is so beyond-bad you have to wonder if it's meant to be a parody of itself.<br/><br/>Remember the scene with the Architect from ""Matrix Reloaded""? Stretch that out to an entire film's length - the result is ""Matrix Revolutions."""
"winner55","1","15","29","1 July 2007"," one cliché after another
","The strongest quality of the original ""Matrix"" was its writing; none of the CGI or goofy political subversiveness or borrowed Asian mysticism would have patched very neatly to the dark, even ugly, ""cyberpunk"" reality envisioned in the film had the script been any weaker. But the dialog actually drove the story, and without a lot of fancy words.<br/><br/>Outside of the fact that the direction is a mess, and the characters no longer know what they're doing there (and neither do the actors) and the CGI has become self-indulgent bloat, the weakest part of this film is its writing. The dialog is just one cliché after another - any Star Wars fan could have written it. The story, which no longer depends on the dialog, but rather on the flatulent visuals, is part Hong Kong action film, part old fashioned war movie, and part Star Trek rehash. The whole cyberpunk angst that made the first film fascinating, has utterly disappeared: in fact an ""explanation"" is provided (or rather hinted at) that all worlds are equally real - and equally false, since programmed by some intergalactic super race - a real cop-out.<br/><br/>The ending of the film - I won't give it away, but it is neither as satisfying as that of ""Dark City"" nor as amusing as that of ""Men in Black"".<br/><br/>Further evidence that Hollywood producers have nothing better to do with their money but flush it down the toilet. And those willing to pay them money for this just end up wiping their bums."
"REPTILEWINS","9","15","29","20 February 2005"," Highly Under-rated
","When I first saw this film back in Novemeber 2003, I expected more of the same from what I saw of the two previous installments...and I would have been very happy. But not completely satisfied. Then I went into this film, I sat through it and had an experience I have never had before (and most likely never will again). I was on the edge of my seat for the full runtime. Emotions I'd felt could not be put into words and when it finally ended I didn't know what to make of it. As I made my way home I could not stop thinking about what I had just witnessed. What was the purpose of this film? All sorts of ideas filled my head and I came to one final realization; The purpose was purpose itself. It exists to embody every thought and emotion we feel as we make our way through life. All our philosophical ponderings and revelations crammed into one brilliant trilogy. Obviously portrayed through extremes for entertainment value. But none the less concluded in supreme fashion. This is a modern classic. An achievement for the ages and a grossly under-rated flick. Best viewed with it's prequels in one sitting, the matrix trilogy is the most spectacular film saga I've ever come across. Depriving yourself of it would be a true loss.<br/><br/>Even if you somehow miss the multiple messages and themes explored in this gem then you must take note of it's amazing special FX (which only help to emphasize the story and enhance the experience) and breathtaking visuals/direction. The acting is solid, and in some parts excellent. Hugo Weaving and Keanu Reeves both give great performances in this one. Morpheus is somewhat toned down compared to his previous performances (most notably in the first film). However with the misuse of Morpheus aside, the film is perfection in my eyes. What critics and people need to realize is that this film is not typical Hollywood film-making, it's something so much more. And it can only be appreciated if it is viewed through the eyes of someone who is willing to be more open, accept a wide array of themes and focus on the bigger picture, not minor flaws, which often blur your perception of the film. Take it for what it is, a great achievement in it's own right and definitely a landmark in film history. Highly recommended."

","So the problem about the Matrix trilogy is this: it totally changes its objectives between the end of the 1st movie and the beginning of the 2nd. In the end of the first, it seemed like they were going to get rid of the matrix and free everyone. In the 2nd and 3rd, it seemed like they were trying to save Zion and that the matrix was just some unimportant story line.<br/><br/>The first movie: amazing. Second movie: not at all great, but better than what I had been hearing. Third movie: As bad as I heard and worse.<br/><br/>One person said upon seeing it right after its release: ""It left more questions than it answered."" Can anyone say UNDERSTATEMENT? NOTHING makes sense at the end of this movie. I'm not even going to bother to try to explain it, because I can't. The climaxes (with Neo & Trinity, and with Zion) were both SEVERE anticlimaxes. The fight at the end made no sense. A good hour of the movie (NOT including the scenes with Neo & Trinity spliced in between) was taken up by the battle for Zion. Nothing happens. Sentinel after Sentinel pours from the sky/roof/whateverthing and attacks the people, and they're killed over and over (and over). It's the exact same. . . the ENTIRE time! At least movie 2 made each action scene different, even if they weren't as good as #1. Oh, and the CG effects were so rampant that it clogged the screen. You didn't know where to look, and it turned out messy, not breathtaking.<br/><br/>Messy. That's the perfect word to describe the end of this disappointing movie. Everything would have made MORE sense, even with the unresolved plot lines, had they stopped at Matrix #1 and left us hanging. ""Quit while you're ahead,"" the old saying goes. If only the Wachowski Brothers had."
"marioonline","1","14","27","3 January 2004"," A lie that is bigger than the Matrix itself
","I will start from the conclusion of it all: this movie is bad. Very, very bad. For a number of reasons, as follows.<br/><br/>1) It is bad for people who haven't seen The Matrix (very good indeed) nor The Matrix: Reloaded (quite bad, better best avoided). To not-enough-Matrix-educated people, this movie is completely meaningless.<br/><br/>
2) It is bad for people who don't care about the pseudo-philosophic-religious-apocalyptic-hallucinating plot, but who are a lot into good special effects. None of the visuals that made the first Matrix a milestone in the history of SF movies is featured in the third instalment. You get a glimpse in the first ten minutes, but that's it. The rest is ugly Robocop-like machine-guns shooting and the usual metal squids. Oh, right...also an embarrassing face-to-face with a head-of-machines that reminded me of Tron (it was many many years ago...no Keanu Reeves there, but Jeff Bridges).<br/><br/>3) Last but definitely not least, this movie is Bad (capital B) for those who cared even a little bit for the plot. Excuse me? Did I miss anything? Wasn't the One supposed to get rid of the evil machines and destroy the matrix? The ""Gran Finale"" of the Matrix Revolutions simply shuns everything that was left pending at the end of the first movie of the franchise.<br/><br/>Shame on W. Bros. (Warner, Wachowski, please pick one): you lied to us.<br/><br/>But there is a bright side. Please spend five minutes of your time to browse the Web looking for comments on this movie and the entire trilogy. Great laughs are ahead, they will make the endurance test in theaters worth it."

I would relate the experience of that movie to getting the plague.  It's not as bad as The Fast and the Furious, but its still a waste of money.

","After ""reloaded"", there might have been billions of possible thematic construction to continue this story or, to say it better: to come to a reasonable, half-logical end of this dystopic saga. But the Wachowski performed well in choosing the most trashy, completely clueless finishing you could imagine.<br/><br/>Why is the war over now,  just because Neo did what none of the special files and certain programs in the machine's matrix-universe was able to - to eliminate the run-outta- control-program Mr.Smith, a kind of matrix super-worm??? In the first two movies, the main plot was the rebellion of mankind against the machines, not vice-versa, forgotten?<br/><br/>What about the promising thought at the end of ""reloaded"", that maybe all the setting of the underground world and the machine-ruled earth surface were kind of another matrix themselves, including Zion and the characters of Morpheus and even Trinity? Why didn't they develop the continuing based on this idea? This would have become much more interesting, I bet.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this movie are the pathetic, but completely dumb dialogues all the time. Come on - smalltalk about emotions of cakes, or laconic statements about hope and love in the face of one's world peril are not just uncredible; they are just nonsense.<br/><br/>There is reasonable danger that The Matrix will come down to a second ""Highlander"": A great main movie followed by a bunch of worse and worse sequels, till even the bravest fans will turn away.<br/><br/>2/10"

","So, it ends the dubious ""saga"" of Matrix, which began as a sci-fi collage in the late 90s, to become this mess of exhausting visual effects and characters which used to work back then, but by the time of this movie, are just annoying brats dressed as emos. But, let's stop complaining, and on to the review (some spoilers ahead).<br/><br/>Remember the cliffhanger which made all the nerds in the Internet to make up incredible and, sometimes, rather creative theories and explanations?, well, all the thing was just Neo trapped in a train station by the Gyro Captain of Mad Max 2. Yes. That was it. And this leads to yet another boring confrontation with the french dude from the last movie, which concludes with... Neo being freed. What's the impact of this subplot in the main story?. None. But it was a good way to resolve the cheap cliffhanger left by the last movie... good in monetary sense, I mean: it made all the fan boys return to watch the movie.<br/><br/>But, alas, then we have the actual plot of the movie, which is so stupid, it's hard to believe. Neo now wants to go to the ""source"". Why?, he doesn't know, but he goes anyway. The rest return to Zion, and we have to watch a battle sequence so boring, it's almost incredible: the characters in that sequence aren't developed at all. Why must we care for these guys?, good question.<br/><br/>So, long story short, Neo goes to the source. He's blind now, but he ""sees everything"", because now it's time to rip off Dune, I guess. Trinity dies, he goes inside a city of machines, talks to a machine, he's plugged into some machine, and then he fights Agent Smith, which is ultra powerful now, for some reason. In the end, he's the victor, of sorts, and the machines stop their attack against Zion and retreat, leaving mankind still mostly enslaved by the machines, and living in a hole in the ground, but everyone is happy: Morpheus is crying of happiness, so I guess we must be happy also.<br/><br/>This movie is so stupid and pretentious, it becomes unbearable to watch. For example, the ""I do this and that for LOVE"" is a recurrent theme, repeated by almost every character of the movie; yeah... that's subtle. You know what's another thing you can do to make it even more subtle?, maybe NOT MAKING EACH CHARACTER ON THE MOVIE REPEAT IT.<br/><br/>But, at least, this movie had a good thing: it ended. Conclusion?, if you don't have a good story, please, don't make sequels to somewhat successful movies. All the hype, effects and pretentiousness can't replace a good story.<br/><br/>3/10"

","Some people who loved the original film of THE MATRIX have been very vocal that the overblown , over bloated sequels have damaged the original . I can see their point , it's a bit like having a third part to THE GODFATHER . The good news is that whilst everyone can still remember parts one and two of THE GODFATHER saga hardly anyone can remember part three . Something similar is at play with THE MATRIX . The sequels are easily forgotten though I wonder if the studio can remember how much money they wasted in producing and how much money people wasted in watching them in the cinema ? <br/><br/>Reloaded was a very patchy but was slightly better than the final film in the franchise - Revolutions . To be blunt it has no function apart from a money making exercise . Neither sequel is self contained . You could say the same about LORD OF THE RINGS since it's effectively one story split in to three parts but you don't believe for a second THE MATRIX was ever conceived as a franchise film . . In fact with an added ten minutes runtime Reloaded could have tied up all the loose ends without a need for a third film . As it stands we get nothing happening plot wise for most of the film then we get an over extended overblown action sequence <br/><br/>The attack on Zion deserves its own paragraph because it's so badly done . It's a sequence inspired by STAR WARS , ALIENS and TRANSFORMERS but fails to live up to any of them . Revolutions was made before the big budget film version so I'm referring to the animated TV show . That's right the climax of Revolutions is less impressive than an animated children's show from the 1980s . It's like going in to an amusement arcade and watching somebody play an arcade game for many minutes . I notice some people have been impressed by the sequence so I'm guessing watching it on an Imax screen at the cinema improves the sequence but watching it on a widescreen TV it's very uninvolving . Interesting too that neither film was nominated for special effects Oscar - or indeed any Oscar which probably sums up the arrogance of the studio who thought THE MATRIX needed any sequels"

","***note this review is of both reloaded/revolutions, as they are, for all intents and purposes one movie split up for separate releases in order to better cash in*** ***spoilers*** I distinctly remember the degree of anticipation I had to see see Reloaded and Revolutions, as did a great number of people I knew. The original Matrix was a great B action movie that I think gave pretty good closure to the story arc presented (Neo realized he is ""the one"", frees humanity, everyone is happy, the end... works for me).<br/><br/>No one will ever be able to convince me that reloaded and revolutions are what the W brothers truly envisioned as the grand arc for this story. What made the original great entertainment was the juxtaposition of the ""real"" world and the ""matrix"" world. People were powerless outside of it, but within the matrix anything was possible. The formula was simple and effective and, most importantly, the action was more or less contained to the world of the matrix, which made the ""real"" world that much more believable and the matrix that much more of an effective plot device.<br/><br/>The Matrix sequels destroy that construct and instead we get...... lots of dark chase-style scenes involving spaceships, giant robots shooting guns over and over and over.... and lots of flat exposition with little to no bearing on whats going on.<br/><br/>There are of course plenty of giant plot holes and huge lapses in logic, but I can excuse those for the most part since it is, at its heart, a big dumb action movie and most big dumb action movies have those things.<br/><br/>The major issue, beyond what has already been stated, lies in that wherein the first matrix the connection between the real and matrix world is well defined ( i.e. how they got in, how they got out, how things could be accomplished within) in order to set up tension, here it is just muddled and vague. Characters appear places and things happen in the matrix because... well.... they just do. There are several long sequences which serve little to no ultimate purpose (the train station, neo's dreams and saving trinity, neo's fight with the 1000 smiths in the park, agent smith ""entering"" the real world, which, far as i can tell, only served to make an excuse for neo to be blinded.... and I could go on) other than to be obvious filler for a pair of movies that EASILY could have been condensed into one 2 hour movie.<br/><br/>(as an aside... think of what actually happens in these movies plot-wise.... machines are coming to zion... machines get to zion... agent smith becomes, to put it simply, all powerful, neo must stop agent smith so that the matrix is not destroyed.... and thats it... the entire zion fight scene could have been condensed into a few short scenes showing the robots getting closer and closer until they are stopped at the last moment because of neo... the same effect could have been done by doing this instead of going through an hour of anonymous people shooting machines over and over, only to be defeated and need neo to save them anyway) <br/><br/>And of course there are the painfully stock characters, the flat, monotone dialog and the wooden supporting acting (save for agent smith, the absolute only positive part of these two movies)..... but all of those things could have been overlooked if the basic set up of the movie followed the idea as the first.... but that movie would have been a little tricky to make, and alas, the W brothers went the easy route of giant anonymous robot battles, ""inspiration"" speeches, and vague pseudo-speak about ""choice"" and ""destiny"".<br/><br/>These movies are bad and more importantly, lazy. Avoid them at all costs."

","I watched ''The Matrix Revolutions'' today for the first time, and now I know that the reason I feared to watch this movie for such a long time, is real: the movie is far from what I imagine it would be and this includes the boring ending. Not Trinity's or Neo's death, this was predictable, but the excess of CGI, the doubt that if Neo is dead or alive,the idea of Smith getting into someone's body outside the matrix( that was stupid) and also Neo being locked in a train station that is a kind of ''limbo'' made the movie be a little disappointed. I also think that ''Matrix Revolutions'' is poorly explained. For example, when Neo killed the sentinels, and the way he maintain his link with the source without being inside the matrix, we see new informations about Neo's powers but very few explanations to understand how his new powers came.<br/><br/>Apart from this, there are new things we discover in this last movie such as like How Zion's story is fake, How Smith turned to be a corrupted file that multiplies himself to destroy the world (and the fact that he is Neo's other side), that the Oracle and Seraph are in fact programs like the Architect among many other stuff. <br/><br/>The end, where the machines agreed to let the humans who want to leave the matrix free(as part of a deal made with Neo) is cool, but not logical, since they want to avoid human population outside the matrix."

","The Matrix Revolutions was was the highest anticipated trilogy finale behind Return of the King...and by the time that Revolutions rolled around, people had grown disappointed of Reloaded while others cherished the philosophy embellished sequel...I personally am one of the latter. Here is why I enjoyed Revolutions, and why I rated Revolutions an 8/10. <br/><br/>Lets start with the acting...and a small but pertinent synopsis. Keanu Reeves reprises his role as Neo. Yes, Keanu Reeves is extraordinarily wooden for this role...but that is because he has to be. The character of Neo has lost everything by the time that the movie roles to a conclusion. Neo does not bear emotion after a certain loss during the course of the film, and the film concludes with Neo fighting himself. However, ""himself"" is represented by Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith. By the time that the two clash in arguably the greatest fight scene of 2003, Neo has lost everything and has no idea that it is simply his will pushing him forward. *small spoiler* Even that does not hold through to the end. While Neo has stripped himself of everything and every emotion, Agent Smith has grown exponentially more powerful and begins to show signs of anger, and even lust for more...something that his character lacked in the timespan of the first film or even the exposition of Smith in the second. Carrie Anne-Moss's Trinity, like Neo, has lost much faith in the war itself, but on the other hand, has gained so much faith for her significant other that she is willing to ""give anything and everything for him"". Carrie Anne-Moss is able to show that strong compassion for Neo without overkilling the role...this is a war mind you and its not wise to be on your knees telling your partner how much you care. Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus is again the strongest and again, my favorite character in the film...although this time, his dialogue is no longer riddled with philosophical jabber and he has now been reduced to one of three captains trying to make his way home before it faces an untimely destruction. <br/><br/>Now...speaking of which...we have the epic siege of Zion. A quarter million cephalopod-resembling machines are augering their way into the last free human domain...and what the audience is treated to is something that both blew us away...and at the same time, something that we expected with Reloaded's over-extended action scenes. What hurts the battle is that we lose touch with Neo and Trinity over the course of a quarter hour...which leaves the audience wondering two things when the story between the pair resumes (where are they and/or who cares). the battle does give us a little insight on some lesser elaborated characters...although not enough to make us like them or care for them. Captain Mifune and Kid are the two main battle-characters...but the female Zee and her rocket-wielding partner Charra are supporters. Some people may like this while others do not...the characters don't really matter during this battle...the battle matters. <br/><br/>Lets talk about the battle itself. It was mentioned in the first, set up in the second and shoved in our face for the finale. I saw Revolutions twice on opening day, once in an IMAX theater and I must say, there were moments when the battle scene in Revolutions made me forget that I was holding my breath...something that the war in Return of the King didn't manage to do. The siege of Zion quickly becomes an exposion of live-action (very little) and CGI (13 of the 17 minutes) action where the humanistic machines of combustion engines and machine guns square off against the machinistic modules of doom that bear dozens of tentacles and lasers to boot. In a nutshell...I say that Return of the King had the best battle sequence of 2003...but only because Revolutions broke us in for it. Seeing two-hundred and fifty thousand squirming and swarming Sentinels against the seventy human-gunned walking tanks is a sight to behold. Wow, wow, wow. <br/><br/>Now that the good things are aside (although I didn't make much mention to the final fight scene) lets talk about what hurts Revolutions the most. Its the poorly constructed script and the characterizations within them. Morpheus (as mentioned earlier) is no longer a philosophy-spouting genius but is simply a worried and frightened captain. Neo has somehow changed slightly from the falling action of Reloaded...he now knows the questions he needs to ask the Oracle, Trinity doesn't show the compassion that was felt in Reloaded...although her final scene did bring tears to my eyes, and the only character who we seem to know inside out from the last film and who has changed only because of what happened in the last film is the French Merovingian (who is my second favorite character). ""The prodigal child returns...are you here for the bounty, Seraph?""...Agent Smith has the worst lines in the film when the excremental feces hits the fan for Neo, (""I was standing here, right here...I'm supposed to say something.""...yeah, something with a little more substance.) and the Trainman thing was a horrible waste of time that doesn't really tie into the last film at all...and the script really doesn't help it there. The Oracle is the only character besides Merovingian who brings continuity to this flick in terms of the script. <br/><br/>As a trilogy, only Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are more epic in size and grandeur...as a pair of sequels...Reloaded and Revolutions are great but seem disconnected from the original somehow...as its own film...Revolutions deserves the 6.3 rating given to it by IMDb.com users...by I am judging it on how well its melds into and finishes this trilogy...which it does damn well. No one can be told what the Matrix trilogy is...they have to see it for themselves...and that is the only way to fully enjoy these three as a trilogy. It is the best seven hours you can spend watching science fiction."

They could have killed everyone else but Neo and Trinity and i would have been OK with it. So could anyone tell me what the Wachowski brothers might have been thinking when they killed her off? I was very disappointed by this final addition to the trilogy, and would much rather it had turned out different. From the moment Neo was blinded, dread crept into my heart and didn't leave.

"johnnyboyz","5","6","10","8 August 2010"," The Wachowski's raise the stakes, and with it shorten the margin for error; as inconsistencies and frustrations mar the final installment of the Matrix franchise.
","The Matrix Revolutions marked a sorry end for one of, certainly at the beginning, the most creative; most original science fiction films running on a smart premise we'd seen for some time. Where smarts; intelligence and well drawn nightmarish worlds complete with engaging ideas to do with life, existence, the universe and everything was once the predominant item on the menu, all has given way in the second Matrix sequel to flurries of ""What on EARTH!?"" moments; uninvolving love stories and dull causality culminating in a stupefying Tekken inspired fight sequence between two characters. The Wachowski's ideas featured in 1999's The Matrix were reigned in; they were kept in check, never feeling as if they were bigger than the project itself and explored in a dramatic and thoroughly substantial manner. The Matrix Revolutions appears tired with its origins, bored even; like the cleverest student in the class whom sits at the back just not feeling up to it on the day of the big exam, and falling just a little short of the pass mark when so much more was expected of them.<br/><br/>As the piece crawled towards the end of its one hundred and twenty five odd minute run time, nearly all sense of immersement and respect for the trilogy was on the way out of the window, and I was praying their God-like Architect character would simply walk onto the screen, turn to the camera, hold up a remote control of some kind and just press a button that would make the screen go black. ""Now, we are finished......."" he would bellow in a gruff, low, robotic tone. What we get is something just as stupid, but less amusing. Revolutions is the point The Matrix ceases to be a science fiction film about ideas complete with an initial, original vision; now rendered a dorky war-come-action film which pastes on a dull love story or two involving the leads and their supporting acts so as to try and insert a bit of heart into proceedings, amidst the gradually less and less interesting teenage orientated spectacle.<br/><br/>The war between man and machine has reached its crescendo, the ultimate showdown between flesh and blood and metal and A.I. has arrived after burning at the back on a hob throughout 2003's other Matrix sequel entitled Reloaded. The eponymous hero of this now chore of a franchise, Neo (Reeves), is stuck in a strange zone of purgatory masquerading as a subway station and cannot get out to aid in the overall struggle. His mentor, love interest and cohorts in the form of the usual suspects Morpheus (Fishburne) and Trinity (Moss) skulk around looking for him as all sorts of different parties, in the form of programmes trussed up in human-being form, knock back nonsense banter about whatever self indulgent; self gratifying themes and subjects the Wachowski's feel they need to instill into the film. One trip to an underground fetishistic themed nightclub contains a fight sequence with guns complete with a stunt that reminded me of the finale to 2001's 3000 Miles to Graceland, the instance in which a guy comes spinning into view from the ceiling with dual machine guns blazing – not a good thing. Having taken two whole films to establish guns are useless in this universe, and pose little threat to those whom fight, it's a wonder the characters still proceed in using them. But it's all spectacle, and most probably acted as good trailer fodder.<br/><br/>There doesn't seem to be much in the way of spine to Revolutions, people flit and hop from incident to incident without much clarity nor apparent reason. One is left persistently wondering where most of the supporting acts stand in their stance on the war overall, the film's complete lack of a hierarchy in this world full of sides, warring existences and clashing ideologies exposing the film-makers' inability to go 'better' after having already gone 'bigger'. Where does a Frenchman and his girlfriend, of whom he seems to have forgiven for her betrayal in the last film, stand? What about the creator and aforementioned God-like character The Architect? Where does he fit into rouge Agent Smith's plans, as an army of machines and their tank equivalents named Sentinels brood in their bid to destroy the human city of Zion. Does any of it matter if The Architect is able to reset everything and play God – does it matter if Zion is annihilated? Nearer the very end, a middle age black woman named The Oracle mopes her way onto screen after some prior interactions with an array of people; where did she fit into all of this and whose side was she on? Whom outranks whom? What does the train driver think of everything? Something may be grossly at stake, but none of it actually matters.<br/><br/>Further pain is inflicted onto the audience during the 'big showdown', a massive fight sequence between the mechanical equivalents of a large spider hybridised with a wasp and named Sentinels with the ground troops of the humans in Zion. Here, the film's shortcomings become grossly apparent in that archetypal mannequins in a young soldier out to prove himself; a General, whom comes complete with a Braveheart inspired speech to rally the troops, and the non-soldiers in the form of two women whom feel the need to take the fight to the enemy, systematically allowing the makers to make it look as if they're addressing the issue of female empowerment amidst this war-zone, begin to take over as central to providing us with human characters as the spectacle moves in. Agonisingly, amidst the millions of people in Zion at the end, it's the General and the grunt whom just happened to bump into one another. Small incidences like that only fuel the feeling of the film's robotic, metallic and dulling temperament; where once was freshness and excitement is now occupied by the droll and incidental, and it sure is relieving to know it's all over."

"dee.reid","7","9","17","7 June 2004"," ""Revolutions""  It goes on and on and then ends, at least with a bang.
","""My admiration for 'The Matrix Revolutions' is limited only by the awkward fact that I don't much give a damn what happens to any of the characters. If I cared more about Neo, Morpheus, Niobe and the others, there'd be more fire in my heart. But my regard is more for the technical triumph of the movie, less for the emotions it evokes. Neo is no more intended to have deep psychological realism than Indiana Jones, but the thing is, I liked Indy and hoped he got out in one piece -- while my concern about Neo has been jerked around by so many layers of whether he's real or not, and whether he's really doing what he seems to be doing, that finally I measure my concern for him not in affection but more like the score in a video game.""<br/><br/>OK, so again I use the words of critic Roger Ebert to help express the feelings I have towards the groundbreaking ""The Matrix"" (1999) and its two lackluster sequels ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" (both films released in 2003).<br/><br/>The first ""Matrix"" was (obviously) the best film in the series, with its wild and kinetic action scenes, and gravity-defying special effects. This film ushered in a new era of action film that would quickly wear out its welcome just two years (and about 20 imitators) later.<br/><br/>It came to us amidst a very welcoming public, dazzling us and puzzling us with that catch phrase  ""No one can be told what the matrix is  you have to see it for yourself""; I myself was put into complete awe by its magnificence and brilliant storytelling. <br/><br/>Then came ""Reloaded"" in May of last year and its sequel later in November. ""Reloaded"" came to us amidst hostilely mixed reviews from both fans and critics and the same situation occurred with the release of ""Revolutions.""<br/><br/>Add to that my feelings are the same. ""Reloaded"" was mediocre at best and the main criticism I had with that film was that it was simply too much, and tried too hard to be deep and meaningful but failed miserably at winning my interest and convincing me of what its supposed goal was.<br/><br/>It was full of semi-meaningful and pseudo-philosophical dialogue about free will and choice; it just didn't matter. It was a lot like just get to the action scenes already, and believe me, I never pray for action scenes but ""Reloaded"" just wore me out with its boredom. I rated that film a ""6"" and believe me, I haven't changed my mind yet on that rating.<br/><br/>Now we're at the third film  ""Revolutions."" Though ""Revolutions"" is, as a whole, a much, much better film than ""Reloaded,"" I got the feeling that it was only making up for the problems that plagued its predecessor, and I'm positive that was what it did. That kind of killed the experience knowing that is what was most likely the intention behind this film; but at least it kept you watching through the special effects and breathtaking action scenes that were reminiscent of the sequences in the first ""Matrix"" film.<br/><br/>Indeed ""Revolutions"" was much more tolerable to watch, and it did go out with a bang as was expected by the ""holy"" crowds that view these films as some sort of new religious experience.<br/><br/>Another scene would be the attack on Zion, which, forgive me, reminded me a little too much of the battle sequence from Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) because of the style and the way it was presented to the audience. Believe me, when I saw this scene for the first time, it reminded me so much of seeing Zeroes dropping bombs on Battleship Row, and then sitting there and watching the Sentinels in this film slay humans mercilessly in their never-ending assault on Zion. <br/><br/>The trilogy certainly ended the way I predicted that it would (I will not disclose the details) but it ends up being worth it (much more satisfying than the abrupt conclusion of the previous film), especially for the all-too symbolic, apocalyptic ""Burly Brawl"" action sequence between Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) at the end of the film. <br/><br/>The scene itself is a masterstroke of genius and technological mechanics, and you're immediately put in awe by the effort and skill that went into engineering it. If the Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry) ever did something right with the sequels, it would easily be this one scene.<br/><br/>Anyways, to conclude, ""The Matrix Revolutions"" ended the series on a good note and I enjoyed it a lot.<br/><br/>I give it a solid ""7."""

","Was it the hype? Was it that people got so blinded by their love of the first one and (tepid toleration?) of the second one that they said they enjoyed this movie? I mean, Revolutions is up there with Gigli, in the ranks of the worst of 2003. Here we observe the utter disintegration of the trilogy - the characters are now forcefully and unnecessarily dramatic to add to the finality of this episode, the plot consists of primarily one extraneously long battle in which things die, noises are made and things explode (and tears are shed so as to dispel the rumor that special effects have entirely replaced storytelling and character development), and martial arts is almost entirely gone. In reality, there is nothing original about this movie. It spews its usual dosage of philosophical babble (which would be interesting, if not for the fact that it has become more of a fad in this movie rather than a sincerely thoughtful deliberation), it asks yet again ""is Neo the One?"" (Jesus, does it matter anymore?) and it answers its question with a wavering ""I can't make up my mind, but let's blow stuff up while I ruminate"" And it was boring. It was almost as if the Wachowski Brothers were attempting to stretch a dying ending into a two hour movie - and trying to spend a lot of money doing it. In any case, to sum up, after seeing this movie I yearned for the original Matrix, and my tepid tolerance of Matrix Reloaded turned to warm acceptance. But maybe that's just an experience in juxtaposition."

","I never walk out of the cinema while a movie is still playing. Though I go to the movies regularly, I choose the movies I watch carefully and inform myself. I build up an expectation based on this and I have rarely been completely disappointed. Most of the time I like the movie I am watching, sometimes it falls below my expectation. But it hardly ever happens that I hate a movie when I walk out of the theater. But there have been two times when I hated a movie so much that I almost left the cinema. The first time was ""Boat Trip"" (which was a sneak preview, I had no idea they were showing this, I assure you I would never have chosen that movie out of free will), the second time was while I was watching ""The Matrix Revolutions"".<br/><br/>I liked the first Matrix film. i was never a geek or anyone who could talk about the ""meaning"" in this movie all the time. Frankly, those people annoyed me and over time, it took a little of my enjoyment of that movie away. But I always recognized it as a visual milestone in cinema.<br/><br/>When ""The Matrix reloaded"" came out, I went to see it with quite high expectations. I thought it was OK, not as good as the first one, but after all, it was a sequel and those are hardly ever as good as the originals. I loved that it still felt like ""Matrix"" to me. It had a lot of the original style and most new characters fit into that. What I did not like was all that heavy dialog. The things the Architect said made me mad. Listening to it, I got the feeling that what was actually being said was something completely banal but the Wachowskys wanted it to sound profound and to have people talk about it so they made it complicated. Still, a nice movie and after the climax, I wanted to know how it would all wrap up.<br/><br/>What a disappointment this movie was! Whereas ""The Matrix Reloaded"" still had a lot of ""The Matrix"" in it, this movie has barely any of the ""Matrix""-feeling in it, but mostly the bad things of ""the Matrix Reloaded"". I never cared much about all this Zion-stuff. Zion to me was the ideal that was built up in the first movie, not that Star Trek -influenced termite hill of the second film. And yet, most of this movie is about that. To top it all of, most of the film is about defending this city, which is done by characters which were all added later while the main characters just vanish or become cyphers.<br/><br/>Only two scenes of the movie take place in the matrix, one in the beginning and one at the end. The rest is just robot wars in Zion and trying to get to the Deus Ex Machina.<br/><br/>Now, like many others, I also felt let down by the ending. i felt it was a cheap way out of all the stuff the makers of this trilogy had hinted at before. But still, the ending was just the thing that assured me in my overall impression. the entire film had been ruined for me a long time before during all these ridiculous and redundant fighting scenes in Zion.<br/><br/>This third installment is so terrible, that it weakens the entire trilogy and even the first movie as a standalone work.<br/><br/>The only positive thing that can be said about it is that after that, all that annoying geek talk about the matrix allegories stopped. It seemed like the Wachwskies wanted to give a wake-up call to all those freaks."

","I might be too old (32) to see movies like this, but this was an utterly unbelievable movie to me.  Perhaps I can't experience suspension of disbelief anymore.  The dialog was entirely predictable in many parts as much of it was very cliche.  Several times I thought perhaps John Travolta actually directed the movie because I could swear I was watching Battlefield Earth on at least 2 occasions.<br/><br/>This movie is a bit pretentious.  It's of course illogical - for example, do the AI machines not realize how easy it is to build a bomb?  Why can't anybody think to reload weapons before they get into the line of fire? Why would anybody build a mechanical assault power suit with no armor for the operator?  Aren't there any targetting systems run by computer anywhere in Zion?  What powers Zion?  People?  Natually, I can go on forever about these little snafus, but there is little point I realize in doing this.  This is an action movie after all which means any sense of reality is forbidden.  Why spend $100K on a (competent) technical consultant when you can use that money on 3 seconds of CGI footage?  The last time that was done was for 2001 which is still watched today, despite it's incomprehensible plot.<br/><br/>If you can ignore the bad dialog, what seemed like soap opera quality acting, the gaping plot holes and the nit picks of a completely illogical and unbelievable plot, it's a wonderful movie.  However, if you're like me, you'll be wondering why you didn't spend the $8 on something more entertaining like an energy saver fluorescent light bulb."

Finally, with The Matrix: Revolutions,' that resolution has arrived, but unfortunately it turns out to be even less satisfying than what I could have possibly predicted in my most depressing nightmares. <br/><br/>To call the Wachowskis' spiritualizing a bag of hot air would be an<br/><br/>understatement of almost biblical proportions, as the ending most resembles<br/><br/>Tron' run through a pretentious Anime filter (don't get me wrong, Tron' is a very fine film and infinitely superior to this dreck).

After all the battles they've had over the trilogy, I didn't know how this one can be any different or any more special, but the Wachowski brothers definitely raised it up to another level.<br/><br/>Like I said, this movie is still pretty confusing.

"tedg","Null","8","15","6 November 2003"," Dimension
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Projects like this contain a promise that they will deliver in three areas: style, dimension and cosmology.<br/><br/>The promise of style is probably the primary one and the easiest to deliver to judge from other projects. The first `Matrix' did a pretty good job on this, at least so far as the leather-and-shades, the design of the machine world (Metropolis with lightning and tentacles) and the crypto screencharacters.<br/><br/>The second fumbled incredibly, especially in defining Zion.<br/><br/>Now the leather is transformed to bondage vinyl and the style overall takes another step backward. Instead of different styles for the different worlds, they all blend into a blandness determined by what was cheap for the animation software, with a lack of detail covered by quick cuts. But they are not the deliberately paced cuts of, say `Once Upon a Time in Mexico,' instead speedy cuts designed to distract.<br/><br/>The matter of dimension is what engages us after the first fifteen minutes, after we have already paid to sit and we begin to pay attention. `Virtual Dimension' was handled well in the first by the introduction of the various dimensions of reality that intersect in complex ways. The second film added little to this but exploited the matter of physical dimensionality - many of the spaces were pretty exciting, including the framing shootout in the skyscraper.<br/><br/>In this edition, it seems that different art directors were assigned different parts of the film (as in `The Cell') and we get a hodgepodge of spatial philosophies. The battles in the ducts, in the dock and in the machine world all had the same blandness, similarly all the kung-fu business that nominally was three-d. Where the first one introduced the `bullet-time' notion of exploring space, we have nothing interesting like that here.<br/><br/>Only in the last ten minutes - the fight in the rain - is it spatially engaging. But by that time the story is worn out.<br/><br/>The matter of cosmology is the most interesting and challenging of the three, because this is where you intend to enmesh the lives of your viewers with your fiction. It is a cheap trick compared to the old fashioned values of narrative, but interesting as hell in what works. You have to have demigods warring; you have to have love (and similar `human' foibles) as assets; you have to have light and evil; every event affects the very future of the world. You have to slowly reveal higher and higher levels of plotters and counterplottering deities.<br/><br/>Lucas was able to postpone judgment on `Star Wars' until the sixth movie. Tolkein had already conquered the major problems before the LOTR movies were conceived, so they had a far lessor challenge. Harry Potter's cosmology never presumes to the scope of religion and always registers as adolescent, so they can even be humorous.<br/><br/>
To my mind - as a reader of classic science fiction - the first film promised but this third film just lacked the imagination it needed to build a cosmology worth criticizing.<br/><br/>Essie Davis was appealing and real, far more convincing as a human than the women tossed into this mess to carry various stereotypes. Fishburne again reminds that he is too fine an actor to blow his influence as a serious black man (one of few public figures it seems) on this tripe.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

The film is grim in nature, and deals with the realization from the last film that victory is impossible. The rest of the film is a big countdown as the humans (who are all wonderful, especially the actors from Zion like Captain Roland or Niobe) try to prepare for the big assault by the machines. The character interactions in the 1/3 point are all on point. We see the characters in their most vulnerable state trying to make it work in the face of armageddon. It all builds to a brilliant action climax that IMO has still to be surpassed even from modern films that tried to rip it off (IE: Man of Steel). This is a fantastic finale to the Matrix trilogy."

","Here comes the third installment of the Matrix Trilogy. Everything that you believed in the first one was already destroyed in the Reload Episode. This time, the Revolutions leads the audience to a normal, not very well done in fact, standard action-packed movie like any blockbuster that may come from Hollywood. Lots of real ugly fake SPFX, lots of noise and to cover all up, a religious choral score by Don Davis (excellent in fact, but only listen to it apart from the movie!). There is nothing left of what marvellous the first Matrix was: Great characters, amazing SPFX, superb story with a real and interesting mythology. The Revolutions destroy all that and become a real pain in the ass moviemaking experience. And the producer Joel Silver quote in the press about the trilogy ""This is the future of movie making"".

"TheNabOwnzz","1","4","6","26 April 2018"," One of the worst movies ever made
","For those who might have though that it couldn't get any worse after The Matrix Reloaded, this is unfortunately a very unpleasant surprise. As if things couldn't get any worse in this franchise, The Matrix Revolutions is one of the worst movies ever made.<br/><br/>Obviously the first Matrix was a great film which didn't need 'Reloaded' ruining its legacy and 'Revolutions' destroying it. The problems in Reloaded continue in Revolutions. It has the same idiotic subplots with characters that have people playing them that simply cannot act ( The two women trying to take down the machines is the primary example, with one of them being a supposed tough broad with short hair and a tank top. Just a bunch of feministic nonsense to keep the social justice warriors happy ). The machines invading Zion is unfortunately just an ugly grey CGI fest which leaves no visually lasting impression on any objective person. CGI doesn't have to ruin a movie, but it has to be used only when it has to be used, not everytime they feel like taking the easy route while filming a scene, which is what happened here. Besides, filming a giant battle like that in Zion was doomed to fail anyway, since Zion was already the most uninteresting area from 'Reloaded' due to its bleak, ugly, grey cinematography and terrible characters.<br/><br/>The Merovingian, the only interesting character added in 'The Matrix Reloaded' was not used at all except for one scene near the beginning which is just an absolute waste of his character potential. Instead we get to see the annoying kid that idolizes Neo saving Zion while one of those two women ofcourse saves him at the very last second. Not sure what the screenplay writer was thinking in this film, but it seems like he was intoxicated most of the time.<br/><br/>Finally we have Neo and Trinity taking the journey to machine city. The movie finds a purpose for Smith in being changed into a rogue program being a threat to the machines and the humans. Yeah, it's terrible writing once again, but he needed to have a purpose for the movie to sell since he was the star villain of the first one. In one of the most terrible uses of CGI ever put to film, we have Neo and Smith face off in the end in a 1v1. They fight while flying in mid-air with the CGI graphics of a 1998 videogame. Where is the brilliance of non-CGI athletic choreography that the original had? Nowhere to be seen whatsoever. We also have a useless subplot of someone in the real world being taken over by Smith yet not killing him when he is blinded for two full minutes, resulting in him getting killed himself, which is ofcourse a terrible hero-villain cliché once again. Smith also seems to suffer from this a lot in the final fight. Despite that he is a rogue computer program, he prefers to preach to Neo instead of defeating him. Neo and Trinity die yet we are not sad for them but happy that this agonizing experience is over. If this kind of thing happened in the original it could evoke emotions in the audience, but not after sitting through this bunch of nonsense.<br/><br/>In the end there is probably nothing positive i can say about this film, it is just a videogame ( And not a particularly good one i might add ) with terrible CGI and with a bunch of dumb subplots with characters no one cares about that absolutely cannot act. Forget the sequels, stick to the first one."
"Matt_Layden","6","4","6","26 August 2005"," Most disappointing film of 2003
","Revolutions was disappointing. Its too bad too, I liked Reloaded and I liked the Matrix In the first Matrix there were many ideas crucial to the plot that were just taken for granted by everyone, such as the existence of an ""Oracle"" inside the matrix, as well as the existence of a ""One"", wow after Reloaded I had hundreds of theories, and when this film came out, to see none of them revealed, or anything remotely good at all, it takes a dive into crap.<br/><br/>This is the weak spot in the trilogy, it does have the best special effects, even the phony SUPER PUNCH to Smith's face was alright. It is the darkest, with death to some main characters, but I guess it's a main problem is that the Wachowski brothers couldn't come up with an ending to please themselves, so they just threw one together. It is probably the worst way to end a trilogy that could of easily become one of the greatest.<br/><br/>The acting in both of the Matrix films are flat, with this one showing the most emotion from Reeves without the aid of SIGHT, which impressed me very much. Morpheus is nothing but a supporting character here and Trinity just follows Neo everywhere, then dies...again. OH GOD the death scene, it went all Shakespeare on us here and dragged on a bit too long. The Kid, it's safe to say that this is the Jar Jar of The Matrix. His dialouge was horrible and terribly delivered, ""Neo, I believe"" Had me laughing to tear out of embarrassment The fight scenes...wow, and not in a good way. First of all we get a rehashed version of the lobby scene in the first one, but how do we make it different, oh we'll get the upside down. Very interesting...please, show us something tangible. How about the Smith/Neo fight, have you've ever seen an episode of Dragon Ball Z, well, yea, that's basically what the fight is, fly around kick here and there and then just give in. Can you say way too many rain bubbles, 3 is enough, not more. The Zion VS Machines was the highlight of this film, it was beautiful and suspenseful, everything I imagined it to be.<br/><br/>The machine city was interesting, and beautiful, the orange/yellow lights, neo's power that is stretches beyond the matrix, all the way to the source, please, that's a cop out. Neo and Trinity soaring beyond the skies, seeing the beautiful sun, just before dipping back into hell, beautiful.<br/><br/>Every character that was the least bit interesting was useless here. The Merovingian, Perphosone, Seraph, Twins (not present, come on they didn't die). I expected a kick ass fight between the smiths and seraph, but got nothing. Every fight scene was a let down.<br/><br/>The story relies on it's viewers to know everything about the the matrix universe, you need to play the games, you need to watch the animatrix, read the comics, just like Episode III. ""Holy ****, it's wingless"" What does this mean, Serpah has an outer shell like the Oracle, and this is his new one? I don't want to go to the games to get the answers.<br/><br/>Overall, I was disappointed with the outcome of this movie, it was a let down, maybe because it was over-hyped, maybe because it was simply crap...I'll never know."
"Stephen F Boatright","9","4","6","8 November 2003"," The Best Possible Ending
","I have never minded being in the minority, so I'll just come out and say it: The Matrix Revolutions is an ending worthy of the Wachowskis' groundbreaking trilogy.<br/><br/>
The key to understanding the Matrix films is to unpeel the onion; reveal the layers.  I believe that you have to understand The Matrix before you watch Reloaded, and you have to understand (as best you can) Reloaded before watching Revolutions. Those who dismissed Reloaded after a cursory glance will certainly not be able to grasp the significance of the Revolutions.<br/><br/>That said, it is certainly not a perfect film.  Its weakest point is in the action rising toward the climax.  There is a time, during the great battle, when we lose track of the hero's personal conflict.  The epic battle between man and machine is extraordinary, and unlike certain scenes in Reloaded, it didn't seem to be about showing off, but there is a time where we lose the momentum of the protagonist's journey.    Of course, it all ties together in the end, but when the audience has to work to connect the two plot threads, it weakens the payoff.<br/><br/>The other problem that stood out was the introduction of ""Red Shirt"" characters in this film. (Fans of Star Trek know what I'm referring to.)  These are the characters that are introduced for the sole purpose of performing an important action and then dying. However, I can't really fault the Wachowskis for this, because no one has ever figured out how to handle these characters.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the Matrix Revolutions answers many of the questions the first two films raised, but fortunately, not all of them.  It leaves some issues open for discussion, which shows that it's still possible to make a film in Hollywood without using a ""Hollywood Ending.""<br/><br/>Bottom line.....watch Reloaded again, and then go see Revolutions!"

","Matrix 2 and 3 are to Matrix 1 exactly the same disaster as Highlander 2 and 3 to Highlander 1.  I have only this theory: When the Wachowski Brothers did the Matrix, it was their first big budget movie and so they couldn't do what they want. The studio gave a mediocre script to a script doctor who rewrote the matrix into a superb modern action tale. And now, as the matrix was a blast, the wachowskis got totally creative freedom and now we know... they actually suck. Their executive producer or even Joel Silver personally would probably have done a better sequel.<br/><br/>Please Wachowski brothers, tell us who was really behind the making of the matrix 1, because that person could not possibly be the same as you poor losers!"
"csrothwec","4","6","11","5 May 2008"," My vote goes with the 'thumbs down' reviewers
","A complete load of old tosh. The lack of any real plot, (with something between 'Theology for Beginners' and simple New Age gibberish competing to try to form this), leads to over-compensation in the special effects field. The latter are used again, and again, and again, and... to portray endless 'battles' between the (human) Goodies and the (Machine) baddies and fights between the three main protagonists and 'Smith', (who comes to represent...oh, that's right, because the plot is so poor, you never really understand what!). Of course, because these battles and fights are so similar and so protracted, they become, like the film as a whole, unbelievably b-o-r-i-n-g and by about half way into the film you really could not care less who wins ""the War"", you just want the thing to end and to justify your video rental money by enduring this torture until the closing credits. What also contributes to this, of course, is the fact that the characters are just human computer game figures by this stage, lacking in humour or any real discernible human emotion to such an extent that, when Neo and Trinity do show their 'love' to each other, it comes across as a scheduled 'emotion check' between the battle/fight scenes and just as authentic as a fifteen dollar note. No, this, (together with the other sequel predecessor, (which was bad, but not to the same degree as this turkey)), should stand as the all-time warning to any director/writer responsible for producing a truly brilliant film, (which the original 'Matrix' certainly was), and who is thinking of producing a/future sequel/s by calling up inside them a little voice, saying, ""Are you REALLY sure?"""
"simonparker1990","3","6","11","13 May 2007"," ""Everything that has a Beginning has an End"", Thank God
","It's now been four years since The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The two sequels that surpassed the classic movie The Matrix. Both were filmed back to back, and both had a huge amount of anticipation riding upon them. The Matrix Reloaded arrived in the summer, and admittedly it received mixed reviews. Those who said it was brilliant and as good as the original, and others who despised the movie, complaining it made little sense and was just one huge disappointment. I personally loved The Matrix Reloaded, I won't lie and say its as good as the original as it really isn't. Its a good movie, that only stumbles at the last hurdle when it randomly introduced a man called The Architect. The rest of the movie is pretty well done, and the Freeway chase is the stuff movies are made for. Then The Matrix Revolutions arrived. I never got to see this at the cinema, but instead forked out a bit of money to purchase it on DVD. Convinced it would be the conclusion I wanted. Alas, The Matrix Revolutions was an unmitigated disaster. A movie, that while having a few tiny brilliant moments, just felt like an anticlimax. A confusing, jumbled up mess, with dialogue so tiresome you struggle to stay awake. Now after four years I returned to it once again to see whether it had aged very well, alas it's even worse than before. Making this the weakest ending to a trilogy I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>So where do the problems with Revolutions start? Well it certainly doesn't start at the beginning, as the opening scenes of Revolutions worked for me. The sections in the Train Station, and the fight in Club Hell might not be in the same league as the first and second movie, but as passable entertainment it works. However after the brief jolt of energy the movie seems to die. The middle section is horrible, just plain horrible. Most people enjoyed the siege of Zion near the end, I really disliked it for some reason. My major moan with the movie is all about the lack of scenes in The Matrix. The highlights of the original and Reloaded all took place within the Matrix. Some imbecile decided to remove The Matrix from the final movie until the ending, and that really makes the movie dull as hell. Why anyone would want to save the dreary ""real world"" is beyond me, I'd much rather have the slickness of the computer programme. As I said the middle has little going for it, after the Oracle meeting which lacks of the spark of the last two Oracle meetings, there is nothing. Neo and Trinity seem to disappear for hours upon hours, and we're left with Morpheus, Niobe and all the others defending Zion. This leads to a special effects filled noisy as hell sequence that never inspires excitement. It has an epic feel to it, yet it never fulfils its full potential.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie also have a very hard time. Keanu Reeves' Neo seems to disappear for half the movie, a shame as here he has some great moments. His character goes through a lot, and by the ending he is still a interesting character. Alas, he seems to be a plot placement now, by the final fight between him and Smith you've lost much of the respect you had for the character and movie. Carrie Anne Moss might have well have not been in the movie. After the finale revolving her in Reloaded you'd have expected her character to have been pivotal. Here she seems almost tired, my guess is she had already signed on for the third one before the script had been done. That might explain why she seems to be hanging around for the hell of it. Laurence Fishbourne is also sidelined, his character no longer the great leader as he was in the original, now he seems almost average. In fact the only character who comes out still brilliant is Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith. He does stumble in the ending, mainly because the fight scene is ludicrous, but his character is still the best thing in The Matrix series.<br/><br/>So what does work in this movie? Thankfully the final fight that the trailers promised between Neo and Agent Smith is breathtaking, for a time. I say ""for a time"" as the fight seems to go on for way too long. When it begins you couldn't be more excited, its the one sequence in this movie that make you sit up and brace yourself for something cool. For the first few minutes it delivers, before it never seems to end and concludes in the most limp ending I have seen in years. The story also does manage to hold it together, and the death sequences have the impact the directors obviously wanted. But apart from a few sequences that work and sit strongly alongside the rest of the series, this movie is just a dreary mess.<br/><br/>Revolutions has not aged particularly well, what was once an average movie is now a plain terrible one. Its well made, but the script and cast seem tired. When watched with the rest of the series the faults are all the more clearer."
"TorpidOne","7","6","11","8 April 2004"," Interesting
","Having now seen the full trilogy along with The Animatrix, I feel that it is safe to say that the body of work is quite an achievement.  While I did prefer the original, I don't think that it is necessarily due to the quality of the film as much as the fact that it was my first venture into the world of the Matrix.  I feel quite strongly that the original film has been grossly overrated despite being a good movie.  It was just as porous in its logic, and certainly the corniest of the trilogy.<br/><br/>The last film is perhaps the coldest of the three, and yet the most intellectually interesting.  The first barely contained much originality of philosophy.  With each film, however, the trilogy veered off further and further into surreal philosophy.  Still, although the most interesting, it's that coldness and detachment that made me like this film the least.<br/><br/>I am sure this, like Lord of the Rings, will go down in history and become a beloved trilogy.  To me, however, it is the achievement of the films moreso than the films themselves that impress.  Unlike the original three star wars, I do not hold a special place in my heart for these films.  Instead I look back upon them as a piece of film history.<br/><br/>The one piece I will remember is The Animatrix.  Now THAT was a great work."

"tom_williams77","7","5","9","9 November 2003"," Good, but requires a lot of outside knowledge
","Matrix: Revolutions has been getting a lot of flak recently.  Part of the reason has been because of lack of understanding, the other part is that the trilogy didn't end the way most people were expecting it to. Although I enjoyed the movie, I admit that it requires a lot of outside knowledge.  Part of the problem is that it is assumed that the viewer is familiar with a lot of things that aren't specified in the movie.  For example, the origin of the man vs. machine conflict is explained in the Animatrix short films, and references are made to events that happened in the Enter the Matrix video game. The second major problem for a lot of viewers is that the film didn't end the way they were wanting it to end.  I'll explain this below:<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS: ******************************************** I've heard many people say that they wanted to see a colossal showdown with man and machine, with man coming out victorious and destroying the matrix.  They evidently viewed the film through a western standpoint of black and white / good vs. evil thinking.  Humanity was supposed to represent pure good and the machines were supposed to represent pure evil. However, in spite of the Matrix films being American, they are very much influenced by Japanese animation, not just in terms of action and stylistic elements, but also in terms of story, plot, and moral message.  In most Japanese animation there isn't as much black and white as there are shades of gray.  This is also true in the Matrix films.  The humans aren't totally noble and innocent. If you watch the Animatrix, you find that humans started the war, nuked the planet, and blackened the sky in a futile attempt to eradicate the machines.  Also the machines aren't totally evil.  In the beginning of Revolutions there is an indication that they are developing human emotions (recall the program Rama saying that he loved his ""daughter"").  Hence, with neither side completely good or evil, the only acceptable solution is peace and coexistance, not annihilation (a common theme in Japanese animation).<br/><br/>Also a lot of people were wanting to see the Matrix destroyed, but I don't believe that this would have have ever been a viable option.  Recall in the original Matrix, Morpheus says that not everyone is ready to be free.  If the matrix suddenly was brought down, how would the masses handle the situation?  Many people would rather live in the virtual world rather than the ruined, post apocalyptic real world.  Hence the matrix remains, but people who want out can leave rather than being trapped. (Remember the last scene where the Architect relunctanly agrees to let everyone who wants to be free of the matrix free?) ****************************************************<br/><br/>Anyway, I overall enjoyed the movie.  The fight scenes were spectacular and imaginative.  It pretty much answered most of the questions, although not in the way many people would have liked.  Toward the end it went a little overboard on the religious symbolism.  There was so much religious symbolism that I was half way expecting Neo to cry ""My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?""  If you like action and don't mind the religius symbolism, and don't have any preconceived expectations for the ending, then you will probably like Matrix: Revolutions.  If not, you will probably be pretty disappointed."
"mgriego007","Null","5","9","28 April 2004"," An awful excuse of a movie
","This movie is about as disappointing as an end to a trilogy can be.  The first movie was great, but these last two have shown what happens when the creators are two creative and are then given a massive budget to play with. Every stupid and ludicrous idea makes its way from the `genius' brains onto the screen because there is nothing stopping them.  That's exactly what happened to this movie.  To top it off, the dialogue is the worst it's ever been.  The Matrix was not known for it's great dialogue, but it did well enough.  Reloaded started to get bad, but Revolutions takes the cake. It's as if every character is required to say the most painfully clichéd things ever.  The so-called `romance' between Neo and Trinity all but fizzles. At least in Reloaded we got a steamy love scene.  In Revolutions, we get a few kisses and a really bad line of dialogue from Trinity.<br/><br/>
The plot in this movie has become completely convoluted and we are dealing with characters for most of the movie that were introduced in Reloaded. The plot becomes more of a philosophical debate on life, which is fine, except that little of it makes sense.  The highly sophisticated dialogues in the scenes with the Oracle are dumbed down completely by the simplistic actions the characters take.  It's hard to care about a lot about them because they say ridiculously stupid things and despite all that is going on around them, they are completely unmoved by it.  Jada Pinkett Smith as Niobi is particularly awful, as is Clayton Watson who plays Kid.  Niobi was the tough and confident expert pilot when we first met her and she is in the end. She doesn't believe Neo is the chosen one, and she still doesn't in the end. Kid is the exact opposite of her and again is the same even in the end.  I heard so many great things about Hugo Weaving's performance and then I saw the movie.  He actually does the laugh Dr. Evil does in Austin Powers.  He at one point makes his lips look like Steve Tyler's all while saying the most ridiculous things I've ever heard.  Someone said he should've gotten an award for his performance, and I agree, but probably not on which award he should win.  The whole idea that Neo must make his own choices is supposed to be a big revelation that draws you into the story.  Didn't we all learn that in second grade?  Why is it taking Neo so long to figure that out, especially when it already was told to him in the first two movies?  Many people have complained about the end of the movie, but that is not the worst part, the beginning and the middle aren't so hot either.<br/><br/>
Reloaded featured an amazing scene on a freeway and some good fight scenes scattered throughout, but Revolutions has only two hand-to-hand fight scenes, one of which being the climatic battle between Neo and Agent Smith. Technically it has three, but since one of them involves Trinity, Morpheus, and Seraph shooting their way past guards in a room with columns, I tend not to count that one since we saw it already in the first movie.  The final scene looks good except that both Neo and Agent Smith have grown two powerful for their own good and the final scene looks more like a fight scene from Superman.  There is the battle of Zion, but the drab looking city is difficult to watch because you have no sense of where any of the characters are or what exactly the humans are fighting to save.  Freedom, obviously, but no time is spent getting the audience to empathize with the humans.  The machines the humans use to fight the machines look drunk, and the machine army seems more interested in flying around in pretty patterns than actually attacking anyone.  And if they are supposed to be brutal and efficient killing machines, then why are they oblivious when humans start firing rockets at them?  Also, if humans have learned how to generate such a large EMP without the use of a nuclear weapon, why do they still use machine guns?  The vague ending makes you wonder if there is a fourth movie planned for the future, which would be unfortunate given the quality of this film.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie appears to be geared towards someone with higher intelligence than perhaps the writer of this critique commands, and if anyone does have that higher intelligence, then by all means share it with me so I may understand.  Unfortunately, the Matrix Revolutions appears to be a dismal failure in concluding what should've been an amazing trilogy. Its complicated philosophical implications are watered down with action that is less exciting than in the first two movies.  If you haven't seen Reloaded, then don't bother watching it or this movie.  If you saw the second movie, then you probably have no choice but to subject yourself to the third one."

The action kept me on the edge of my seat, the whole Zion battle was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. Although I must say this movie was just not all action... That's right, unlike the Matrix Reloaded which was just a giant action movie (not saying that's bad either) but Revolutions was a lot about preparation and Planning. There still was a lot of action and fighting though.<br/><br/>I still think I may like the first one the best because that one started the epic adventure. Then I think of the movie I just saw and think: I like them in different ways.

"paul-nemecek","9","4","7","6 July 2018"," The Grand Finale
","I have to confess that I went to see this film with fear and trepidation. I have been a big fan of the Matrix trilogy and I was afraid that the finale would be a major letdown. Sequels are a risky business at best. If you've seen Rocky V, Jaws 3-D, or any of the Halloween movies after the first one you know of what I speak. In Rocky for example, we meet characters, situations, and places that are fresh and new. The hero's quest is as old as mythmaking itself but the new contexts and characters allow us to approach old myths in new ways. As each successive sequel was made, the myth became trite and clichéd, the characters devolve into caricatures, and the formulaic nature of the films makes them mundane and boring.<br/><br/>It is admittedly a difficult task to keep the mythmaking fresh and awe-inspiring. I am pleased to report that the Wachowski brothers succeed in doing just that. I read several reviews that were fairly negative about the film, but as I read the reviews it was clear to me that the critics simply didn't get it. They reminded me of the critic who criticized Field of Dreams for not being as good as other baseball movies. If you have seen Field of Dreams you know that that film is not really a baseball movie at all.<br/><br/>As in the previous films, there is an abundance of special effects in the battle sequences. There are also more sparks in the relationship between Trinity and Neo. In my review of the original film I praised the film because of the abstractness of the mythology. When we try to literalize metaphors they lose much of their power. Neo-Marxists, Buddhists, and Christians could all walk away from this film feeling as if the film had strengthened their faith. If we look at the film as a commentary on the postmodern world, the Architect and the Oracle become perfect metaphors for the competing voices of modernity and postmodernity respectively. <br/><br/>One of the reasons I was nervous about this final installment was my concern about the Messianic Neo character. The Christological images are fairly strong in the film, but I have always had a problem with Neo as a machine-gun toting Messiah. Once I let go of my literal reading of this metaphor I was able to appreciate the richer metaphors contained in the film. I resonate with the film's critique of the ""domination system"" (to borrow a phrase from Walter Wink's The Powers That Be), but I did not want this film to degenerate into yet another legitimation of the myth of redemptive violence. Fortunately, it does not . . . to say more is to give away too much of the ending. <br/><br/>This will not be everyone's cup of tea, and more than a few viewers will leave scratching their heads or disappointed that there wasn't even more computer-generated mayhem. But for those who have eyes to see, this film is clearly worth a look."

","*contains spoilers*<br/><br/>you know, it is understandable to see why many were unsatisfied with the final installment of the matrix trilogy. my only complaint b eing is that this movie was just a continuation of reloaded and enter the matrix. however, is that a bad thing? if anything one could admire the boldness of a movie not following the typical Hollywood pattern of trilogy. that principle being that each movie has to have a wide stream of circumstances to complete that movie; when in fact this movie simply gave us a wide barrage of action and a subtle conclusion. i think that is why many were disappointed with it. to see our hero neo have such a simple demise rather than a strong, hardcore, and victorious defeat. the actual ending though confusing was appropriate as well. and to all of the viewers who were annoyed by the intricate dialouge of the movie, i have to ask why would you be surprised at this. i know it must suck to have to watch a movie or scene over and over to fully understand a part. but ask yourself this, how many times did you have to watch the first movie to get a clear and concise understanding of that world. for those who were upset that the majority of fighting took place in the real world rather than the matrix...........SO WHAT!!! i for one was pleased that the fighting was happening here as opposed to the matrix. why, because these characters fight so hard in the matrix, it was nice to see the world that these people were fight so valiantly to protect. notto mention that there was a terrific final fight in the super burly brawl between neo and his nemesis agent smith. i could give many other retorts to problems but that would be pointless. i can only say that i would suggest this movie to anyone and would also protest that this is a phenomenal ending to such a pivotal trilogy. 8 out of 10 stars!!!"
"fatpeach17","7","4","7","5 November 2003"," Great Visuals and Audio, but a let down ending.
","Spoiler Alert This third edition of the Matrix series was just as great as the other with the visual and audio effects, but the ending was a let down.  Even though you could see it, coming from the point that Neo has his little accident with the power cable.  All though the end was bad, it does leave a little gap for another sequel, and another chance to end it right.<br/><br/>As far as my feelings overall, it reminds me too much of Star Wars: Episode I.  Think about it.  We find a female in trouble. (Queen Amidalia and the Oracle)  Next, we meet stupid people.  (Jar-jar and the little girl who is the last exile.  What a coincidence) Then the warriors go to fight evil. (Qui-gon & Obi-wan and Neo & Trinity)  After a lot of mixed other stuff, we arrive at two final battles, one with armies and one with main characters. (Q-g & O-w meet Darth Maul and Neo & Tri. meet Smith.)  Both movies have good fights, but then everyone dies.  (Obi-wan dies just a little later than the others do)  After all that, we are told that we should look to the future for hope.  (Let us not forget the idea that we have to make a choice to do so.)  The only thing that is different is that Star Wars jumps from battle to battle every few minutes and Matrix waits until one is done and then switches.<br/><br/>Overall, I do think that the movie is okay.  The effects do out-weigh the plot in this one, just because the other two Matrix movies back it up.  I would give it a 7.5 out of ten if I could, but they do not allow half points."

","After seeing it at the cinema, I logged onto the IMDB website yesterday and found nothing but good reviews of The Matrix: Revolutions. Oddly, a lot of people were praising it's subtle use of symbolism and it's great script and story. A few went so far as to say that in concluding it the way that they did, the Wachowski brothers had made an almost perfect trilogy raising poignant philosophical, cosmological and theological questions such that it could be regarded almost as a contemporary version of The Bible.<br/><br/>One guy even said that the battle sequence was better than any war movie he had ever seen and that Saving Private Ryan couldn't even compare to how wonderfully gritty it was! Were you people watching the same movie?<br/><br/>Could people this deluded really be walking the earth? If so, how is possible for people so stupid to have survived to an age where they can type without having first been killed by choking on a mobile phone or batheing in petrol whilst lighting a cigarette, or even testing the trigger of a shotgun whilst simultaneously licking a spec of dust from the inside of the barrel. The only positive thing I could think to say about this movie, is that the money that these people spend on Matrix merchandise, DVD's etc, is money that they will not spend on food or heating, giving rise to a small chance that they may die of pneumonia or starvation and thus incrementally raise the average IQ of the rest of the globe.<br/><br/>I know I'll be accused of being picky as really it was only lacking in a few areas, such as script, story, acting talent, consistency, and any reason not to get up and walk out of the cinema utilising the opportunity to moon the screen with contempt on departure. It appeared that each character had only one line that they kept repeating, but which the Wachowski Brothers brilliantly and subtly altered each time. ""It'll never work godammit!!"" then later... ""Godammit it'll never work"" - Genius.<br/><br/>I'm going to try very hard not to mention the veritable treasure trove of movie cliché's that the brothers must've raided when writing the 'script', other than to point out that at one point I went over 20 mins without hearing a single line of dialogue that didn't make me laugh with utter disdain.<br/><br/>Even the wardrobes were bad (in The Matrix?!!).  I mean, morpheus' Casio dealer outfit from reloaded was bad enough, but I almost walked out if the Odeon when I saw the Merylvingyn dressed up like a satanic Harry-Hill surrounded by a group of rejects from the Slipknot-gig that was apparently occurring across the road during filming. This movie is so terrible it makes me want to go out and buy a thesaurus just so I can come up with words that will adequately describe it, but then the majority of people who went and seemed to enjoy it would fail to understand such language, so I'll keep it simple.<br/><br/>The Matrix revolutions is bad...... Very, VERY, Bad."

It's action movie 101. When you constantly have armies yelling ""Raaaahhhhh!!!"" at machines while shooting more bullets than John Rambo and John Matrix combined, man does it get old fast. The Wachowskis should've taken lessons from Peter Jackson's Two Towers. In the middle of the melee of Helm's Deep, it cuts to Treebeard with fellow ents, talking to hobbits.<br/><br/>The point is, you have to give the audience time to breath or they suffer from ennui. It's exhausting sitting through the last 38 minutes of battles in Zion, battles with sentinels, battles with agent Smith. Sure, it's all very slick and well choreographed, but it's like being beaten over the head with a 2×4 while playing PlayStation. <br/><br/>I understand movie goers want a big action spectacle finale, but not this excessive. it goes on for waaaay too long.

"tieman64","Null","3","5","3 September 2010"," Cyberpunk sucker punch
","The Wachowski Brothers released ""The Matrix"" in 1999. The film starred Keanu Reeves as Neo, a man who realises that ""reality"" as perceived by most humans is actually an elaborate simulation called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue humans and essentially use them for slave labour. A massive box-office hit, the film's archetypal ""Hero's Journey"" connected with audiences, particular young males. Like ""Star Wars"", The New Testament, ""Lord of the Rings"" and virtually every ""modern myth"", it was filled with talk of ""destiny"", ""chosen ones"", ""salvation"", ""special missions"" and supernatural powers (the force/the code), which of course only our prophesied hero, Neo, possesses. <br/><br/>The Wachowskis released two sequels (""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"") several years later. Disparaged by fan-boys, these two films created a sort of anti-myth. Or more precisely, the machine villains of the franchise were revealed to have created an artificial myth in order to give false hope to the film's human heroes, and by extension, the film's audience. It's not so much that the sequels deconstruct what Joseph Campbell famously called the ""monomyth"" or the ""Hero's Journey"", but that they embodied a kind of postmodern scepticism of the ""metanarrative"", and so treat the film's myths as a further layer of Matrix simulation which people ""plug into"" to further delude themselves.<br/><br/>""The narrative function is losing its functors, its great hero, its great dangers, its great voyages, its great goal."" Pilosopher Jean Lyotard wrote decades ago. ""Where, after the meta-narratives, can legitimacy thus reside?"" Echoing Lyotard's words, ""The Matrix"" franchise highlights a subtle cultural shift, the totalising nature of meta-narratives, and their reliance on some form of ""transcendent and universal truth"", now increasingly rejected. <br/><br/>What the Wachowskis show is that the ""master narrative"" is always created and reinforced by power structures (ie the villainous machines in the film), that they are never to be trusted, that they are designed to embody progress towards a specific goal, that they dismiss the naturally existing chaos of the universe, that they are created to marshal people toward some theoretical doctrine and that they serve only to placate subjects with notions of ""order"", ""structure"" and ""hope"".<br/><br/>And so ""The Matrix"" sequels have interesting (ie seemingly annoying) reversals which few myths possess. Firstly, our hero (Neo) is actually the film's ""bad guy"". Secondly, the closest the franchise has to a good guy is Agent Smith, whom most perceive as the villain. Thirdly, far from being ""the Chosen One"", Neo becomes just another iteration in a long line of manipulative computer programs. Fourthly, Zion, the city which Neo is foretold to ""save"", is itself just another level of simulation, a memory cache designed to house radicals and provide the illusion of hope, choice and free-will, its panel of leaders all computer programs designed to foster a belief in Neo. Fifthly, the film's Oracle is not a benevolent ""helper figure"" (ie Yoda), but is really working for the machines and is attempting to instigate the Matrix equivalent of ""multiculuralism"", the passive assimilation or social integration between mankind and machine. In other words, the ""efficiency obsessed"" machines (like some dystopian version of a drone reliant capitalist technocracy) don't want to waste time fighting humans, they want the human rebels (ethnic minorities and outcast hackers) to willingly ""join them"" and so have constructed an elaborate myth to engender this symbiotic merger.<br/><br/>Sixthly, the franchise's dialogue/acting becomes increasingly, and deliberately, phony. Everyone in the sequels speaks of determinism and of every micro-event being preordained. Everything you see in the sequels is thus not only programmed, but has happened repeatedly before in cycles, and is anticipated by super computer characters (some of whom possess ironic self awareness) which process zillions of different variables, tracing cause and effect to such an extent that they know exactly ""what happens next"". <br/><br/>The notion of ""choice being an illusion"" is important to the franchise. Previous versions of the Matrix (essentially a jail for humans) didn't work because ""human slaves"" didn't have a choice. Gradually the machines allowed the slaves to have ""the illusion of choice"", but this too didn't work. Choice was not the problem. The problem was that humans opted for what the machine's perceived to be ""the wrong choices"" and sometimes ""no choice at all"" (radical non-participation). Thereofore, the machines created Neo to encourage others to obey ""their choice"" and ""be participatory"". The problem was, after six cycles, Neo got smart. The goal then became to con Neo; to trick him into believing that he too could choose. Extrapolate this theme to the real world and you have all kinds of sinister ramifications.<br/><br/>Seventhly, far from a rebel, Neo has been supported by the system all along. Eightly, like Satan, Agent Smith throws himself out of ""heaven"" when he realises he is ""facing deletion"". If Neo is part of the system, Smith is the enemy of the system. He wants to bring it crashing down. This is similar to the writings of many Gnostics who view Satan as the ""hero"" of Genesis, as he sought to free God's subjects from their subservience and false realities. Ninthly, many complain about the film's ""fake sets"" and ""fake action scenes"", but once you realise that these characters and landscapes are supposed to be digital simulations, it all works. Why should they obey the laws of physics?<br/><br/>Finally, ""Love"" and ""the hero's sacrifice"" are key themes in myths. With the Wachowskis, however, these things are subverted. A character called Trinity is created to ""install"" love and self-sacrifice into the deluded Neo, whilst other characters (the elder's conversation at the water refinery, the birth of Sati through ""machine love"" etc) are created to subtly introduce Neo to the idea of a symbiotic relationship between machines and man. The franchise's ""myth"" is therefore a sort of unholy trinity (between man, machine and the ghosts in the matrix) in which ""enlightened"" and ""free"" humans are wilfully re-imprisoned by their false Saviour. Creepy.<br/><br/>8.5/10 – Subversive anti-blockbuster."
"freemantle_uk","4","3","5","29 August 2010"," So it comes it this
","To me The Matrix Revolutions is one of the biggest cinematic disappointments I have seen. I enjoyed the first Matrix film and whilst The Matrix Reloaded was rubbish on a plot level it was still good on an action-adventure level. I had hopes that everything would come together in the third part of the trilogy but like many Matrix fans I find it is best to ignore this film.<br/><br/>Following straight after the events of The Matrix Reloaded Neo (Keanu Reeves) is trapped in a coma, with his mind in the Matrix like limbo. The machines are only hours away from Zion and everything looks lost for humans. When Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) rescue Neo our hero sets out on a suicide mission to go speak to the machines with Trinity. Morpheus and the rest of the humans go back to Zion. In the Matrix itself Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) is taking over and becoming a threat to humans and machines.<br/><br/>First the Matrix film was very clever, on a simple level its can be broken down to the world that Neo knew was a computer programme and for knowing that he was able to do whatever he wanted to help fight the Machines. The Wachowski Brothers were able to bring in other references, from 1984 and Alice in Wonderland to Plato to computing and cyberpunk, making complex ideas about reality manageable to a wide audience. But with the sequels however the films became to bogged with the philosophy with ideas of balance, choice, free will, fate, the meaning of words etc.. which felt so force, that the Wachowskis were trying to make the sequels film philosophical. The only people who enjoy it are the kind of young fools who pretty much say 'I'm so clever because I can understand this'. The plot of The Matrix Revolutions became bogged down with all it's subplots and it's ending was a real cop out: SPOILER ALERT that humans and the machines end up in peace together so Neo and Neo ending up defending Smith by becoming a part of him. The Smith part is able breaking the equation but it still was a big let down of an ending Spoiler OVER. The Wachowski seem to be loosing the plot by adding more and more random new ideas into the film, like the limbo train station with The Trainman (Bruce Spence) and Neo being able to see a flaming world and having powers beyond the Matrix. Things just happen for no real reason, there is a lack of a plot and film was an anticlimax.<br/><br/>The action itself is decent and perfectly edited by Zach Staenberg, who edited the last two films. But the action can not compete with the levels of the first two films. The first fight between Neo and Smith should have been epic, Neo fighting dozens of clones. It was a fine well edited fist fight but it just lack power and the flying in the sky should have been between Superman vs. General Zod and remind the zero gravity fist fight in Inception (even though that was released 7 years later). I did however enjoy Don Davis operatic music when Neo and Smith first start to fight. The battle of dock was grand and will satisfy action junkies and was a fun sequence, almost like a high-tech Lord of the Rings. But the battle was full of stock characters like the hard ass Captain Mifune (Nathaniel Lees) who gives words of encouragement to Kid (Clayton Watson), Charra (Rachel Blackman) who we never saw before was pretty much a red shirt (a character introduced so that they would die) and Commander Lock (Harry J. Lennix) is speaks in military clichés. The action in the Matrix world takes a backseat for the most part.<br/><br/>A problem in the film is the dark cinematography of Bill Pope (who did good work on the previous films). It made many of the scene more difficult to see much of the action and gives the film a too gloomy atmosphere (which is really saying something). When I watch a film, I want to see what's happening, even in a scene in the dark.<br/><br/>Acting wise Reeves is as wooden as ever but that quality works in The Matrix. Other actors like Fishburne, Moss and Weaving were strong, particularly Weaving as Smith, giving important speeches. Ian Bliss was also very good as a villain, giving a great impression of Weaving. And as stated Lennix was offering the most clichéd performance possible.<br/><br/>My initial reaction to The Matrix Revolutions was complete hatred. My opinion has soften and I can enjoy the battle of the dock. But I still think this film is a let-down, an anticlimax and a cop-out by the filmmakers."

","Having written a three part novel, it is my firm belief that before the writer begins the first novel, he or she should have a firm idea of how the third novel will end, as well as the connective tissue that holds the three together. I don't care what the Warschawsky's Press Agent would have you believe, but when the first Matrix was completed and awaiting release, nobody was thinking sequels - and it shows. There are some movies that deserve to stand up as one time only. The first Matrix was a ground breaker in look and f/x. The next two were boring high budget films which require a cheat sheet to keep track of the plot.<br/><br/>The best that one can say, is if given the choice of producing large scale crowd effects, the job should go to WEDA. Their software is positively awesome. As for the Reloaded and Revolutions, they are clinkers, pure and simple. A good rule of thumb: if a movie relies on special effects more than cinematic story telling, it means there is no story, and the movie isn't worth your valuable time."

As for the concluding chapter, it's hard to review without revealing spoilers.. but it was at least better than the dreadfull part 2. Now the first half hour - 45 minutes of this one is dreadfully borring and similar to what was wrong with ""Reloaded"".. leaden dialouge, lack of story momentum..etc.. However the mid-section of the film, featuring the battle for Zion was terrific.. very exciting action sequence that woke me up and kept me interested for most of the rest of the movie. Alass, the climatic showdown with Smith at the end was a bit of a letdown in that it was abunch of supposedly cool fx shots with no emotional weight to them.. and the actual ending of the film just was such a ""what the heck"" moment that it really left you wondering what the whole point was. Keanu Reeves is the lead character again, but he remains unable to deliver a convincing line read, and much of his dialouge, especially at the ending, is incredibly corny. Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishbourne in this chapter get left pretty much on the sidelines and dont get to do much.. the visuals take center stage in this chapter.. though Jada Pinkett Smith is the only supporting player to come off pretty good. On the whole, it was a hit and miss affair that is an improvement over the inept part 2 but nowhere near as good as the original. Still, for technical merit, and the one terrific fight scene, I'll give it a decent grade here. GRADE: B+"

","""The Matrix: Revolutions"" devolves the trilogy into conventional sci fi, with very expensive special effects that go on and on.<br/><br/>I would have liked more imagination -- the evil machines sure looked like The Borg Queen (with a similar concluding plot twist from ""Star Trek""), while the good guys' machines looked like the gangly mechanical attackers from one of the ""Star Wars"" movies so I kept losing track amidst the extensive blasting which blaster I was supposed to be rooting for.<br/><br/>The romance, which is my favorite part of the series as a humanistic element, is at least still there, just way reduced to a tragic level I appreciated best when I was 12 years old, complete with bombastic musical theme. I almost did sigh at ""Trinity's"" declaration: ""Six hours ago I told Merovingian I would do anything for you. You know what's changed in six hours? Absolutely nothing."" Not that there's anything wrong with appealing to pre-teens like that these days. <br/><br/>The music finally picks up at the conclusion, being redolent of ""Carmina Burana,"" probably to recall the orgy in Zion scene from ""The Matrix Reloaded.""<br/><br/>All in all, it was better than ""Starship Troopers."" <br/><br/>(originally written 11/12/2003)"

","""Revolutions"" like the previous two ""Matrix"" films has a storyline to keep us all enthralled and confused, yet interested and entertained.

The film looks disconnected and out of control which ultimately distracted me from the positives that ""Revolutions"" had to offer. Many of the action scenes look more at home in ""The Anamatrix"" than a live action film. The last time I saw such a brilliant film look so blatantly bad was when I last saw ""Reloaded"".<br/><br/>I admit that ""Revolutions"" is a great film on the second and third viewings. I don't seem to concentrate so hard on the cartoon figures and tend to get more engrossed in the film. I do love the film and the franchise once I can see past ""CG Neo""."

","This movie was considerably better than Matrix Reloaded. I think for the most part it tied things up nicely and left just enough loose ends to potentially extend the story. I would also say that Revolutions had a very ""Return of the Jedi"" vibe going on. The switching between multiple places worked almost as well as Jedi and the ending left me looking for Ewoks.<br/><br/>The acting is lukewarm with one exception. Hugo Weaving earned his paycheck a few times over. Just when I think a monotonous character is doomed to getting an emotionless performance, Mr. Weaving proves me wrong.<br/><br/>As I said before, my biggest beef with Matrix: Revolutions is the ending. The final fight is anticlimactic as is everything that follows.

To me, it's the next step in the Wachowski's incredible philosophy, the movie satisfied me. The human/machine battles had me literally on the edge of my seat and the ending surprises had me thanking the actors for believing in the Wachowski's vision. This is only my opinion, but I have no idea why there is so much negative press for this movie. So what if it didn't make a huge killing at the box office! Did the first Matrix do that? No and look at what it has influenced today. I cannot wait to go back and see it again."

","Let me start off by saying I didn't like Reloaded all that much.  In fact, other than a couple of scenes I didn't like it much at all.  This one, however, I found to be very enjoyable.  I was looking for a couple of hours of diversion and I got it.  This one picks up where the last left off; thank goodness there was no recap.  Neo is in a comatose state and the machines are close to Zion.  What ensues after a somewhat slow start is a great battle and one heck of a finishing fight.  Not as many speeches in this one, and thank God there was no rave scene or anything like that in this one. Morpheus kind of takes a back seat in this one and that helps as he has less time to make dramatic speeches, actually Neo isn't in a lot of this one either.  Still it works cause the battle between the squid robots and the people is really cool.  The humans use these cool machines that are reminiscent of the loaders in the movie ""Aliens"" except they have guns. Agent Smith is also back and he is close to taking over not only the matrix, but also all of the machines.  This sets up an incredible fight that reminds me of a fight in the anime DragonBall Z.  In fact this movie makes me excited about that movie, cause I can see they can do fighting right in that one.  It also makes me excited about Spiderman 2 as those tentacles on the squid robot look like his arms would.  And those machines the humans were using make me look forward to the Transformers live action movie.  Are all the questions answered?  No, but some of those questions should have never been brought up in Reloaded to begin with cause they were only used to try to make it seem more complicated than it was.  This movie was simply more of an action movie, which is probably why it turned some off, but I liked it. I gave Reloaded a 4, but I give this one a 7, it is not without its flaws, but overall this one did not disappoint me."

The second movie and this one aren't as much fun as the first one, which was both groundbreaking and full of interesting ideas, but the action sequences and quality of the special effects are even more impressive in the last 2 pictures. I think that I liked ""Reloaded"" more than ""Revolutions"", because I felt that ""Revolutions"" left a few too many threads dangling. Like most movie series, this one runs down, but it had so much gas to start with that this movie can only disappoint if compared with the first one."

","It took me a long time to get over M2, but finally I decided to rent M3 and surprisingly, I was very pleased. <br/><br/>You really have to put your thinking cap on a few times here and pay particular attention to all conversations that the Oracle and Agent Smith partake in. This will help you to understand what is going on. What is going on? <br/><br/>Spoilers: Don't read unless you've seen the movie<br/><br/>Bottom line: The Oracle gave herself up in order to make Agent Smith so big, no one would be able to stop him, not even the machines or the Architect without help from the One. Thus, Neo, was able to broker a peace deal with the Machines provided he wins because he believed he was able to stop Agent Smith from taking over the Matrix and ultimately everything. Of course, this was exactly what the Oracle was rooting for. <br/><br/>I loved the ""battle of wits"" between the emotional, caring Oracle and the logical, cold Architect. The former being referred to as the Mother of the Matrix and the latter, as the Father. The Oracle wanted to stop the war and wanted the machines to give the humans a choice-to choose either a peaceful existence in the virtual reality Matrix while feeding the machines, or freedom from the Matrix and hunkering down in the dirt, darkness, and nuclear fallout in the Earth. Which would you choose? <br/><br/>Unlike its predecessor, the battle scenes were not too consuming and boring this time around. (Neo vs. 1000 Agent Smiths in M2 was the biggest culprit!) The battle for Zion was pretty intense and I'm sure satisfying for most. As for me, I'm not a big battle guy. However, the final brawl between Agent Smith and Neo is a classic for all times. Yes, even I liked that one.<br/><br/>The ending was a surprise to me because of course, I expected the humans to win over the machines. I like this ending much better. As for Trinity's death--yawn! No big deal to me; this freed up Neo to allow him to do what he was meant to do. Sorry Trinity, you were okay while you were.<br/><br/>Fortunately, M3 did make me forget almost all the mistakes M2 made. Now, it's time for me to head over to Hollywood to rent the Animatrix DVD. I understand this DVD will answer some of the questions still haunting me today."

","To all you mediocrities out there whining about how the Wachowskis have sold out and are milking a franchise for all it's worth - I would like to point out that:<br/><br/>1. Taking over 60 days to film a 14 minute highway sequence and spending millions of dollars on a single scene is NOT selling out. <br/><br/>2. Having your actors train full-time, 5 days a week for several months to meticulously choreographed fight scenes is NOT selling out.<br/><br/>Selling out and milking a franchise would be making Friday the 13th Part VIII.<br/><br/>If the Wachowskis wanted to simply cash in on your desperate, barren imaginations, they could've done it in 2 days and produced something like Wing Commander.<br/><br/>If you're having trouble with all the loose ends and unanswered questions, then may I suggest something a little less straining on your limited intellect, like The Fast and The Furious.  I'm sure that movie has much less ambiguity for your jaded tastes, and will spoon-feed you the answers like you need them.<br/><br/>I am by no means a huge fan of the Matrix trilogy, nor did I find the last 2 installments particularly good, but Reloaded and Revolutions were, in their own right, entertaining and visually spectacular.  Get off your expectations and what you think Hollywood/the Wachowskis 'OWE' you.  If you're too cheap to spend 10 bucks or whatever it costs you to take a chance on someone else's efforts and achievements, then just stay home and watch TV all day. Like any notable work of its time, The Matrix series will be looked upon by history as something wasted on the cynical, uncomprehending and unappreciative rabble it was released to."

","Not nearly as good as the previous two. most of the action was forgettable. the war scene completely detracted from the main story of the movie (ie neo). there were only a few good action scenes, a couple early, and the final fight was epic (about 3 viewings)"
"Horror-yo","7","2","3","27 May 2019"," Better than the second - Nowhere near the first - Altogether disappointing conclusion to the trilogy
","There's no questioning the first one is by far the better film in the trilogy. However, opinions about the second and third volumes differ very often.
Despite this one having just as much action as the second one, there's an epic tone to the action scenes and context with philosophical undertones to the central theme (man vs machine, and the implications behind that narrative) whereas the Matrix Reloaded was just sheer Hollywood blockbuster action for the sake of action: senseless, lengthy action with no meaning or purpose besides being spectacular big production spectacle. This film is close to the second one though in how it delivers plenty of utterly clichéd manufactured one-liners and obvious stereotypes that always come up in war/action movies.<br/><br/>All in all, this film delivers a lot more answers and story content and wisdom than the previous volume, but fails at being emotionally potent like the first one was. The scenes set up to be the most poignant and powerful fall short in terms of punch and efficiency, for e.g. Trinity's death or even Neo's for that matter and the ending as a whole.<br/><br/>It feels globally like parts II and III were just manufactured Hollywood productions that fed off the Matrix universe, with a few good elements: the Architect and Merovingian in 2, here some of the imagery (Zion battle or the machine city) and some good scenes (most of the ones involving Mr.Smith). After being subjected to the utterly mind-altering experience that was The Matrix (original) it certainly feels disappointing ultimately to be fed such a bland ending with almost no power or moving quality to it. Better than the second for sure, more back on track in the Matrix universe, but not anywhere near the first in any regard.<br/><br/>7/10 for epicness, relentless and intense action that manages not to feel boring, and a good effort to at least attempt to conclude probably the greatest sci-fi of all-time that blew everyone away at the end of the 90's."

","The final installment of the Matrix series mimics the sacrifice of Jesus. Neil must die in order to free humanity from the Matrix and allow it to enter the paradise of a restored and beautiful earth. Whether the Wachowskis, born into a Polish Catholic family, believe the Christ Redemption story or simply used it as a plot device, I do not know. The dramatic resolution is somewhat unsatisifying in that it is not clear whether the earth has been restored and humanity freed. The film possesses the same enticing green tint of the two previous installments and the the film's special effects, like the first two, are both imaginative and exceedingly well done. Viewing this installment without having seen the first two may cause the viewer to judge this final chapter as unsatisfying and possibly pointless."

","Even The Matrix franchise is not immune to the curse of the trilogies; a curse spanning generations involving the triumphant success of a first film followed by waning enjoyment until a dull and dreary finale. The Dark Knight, The Hobbit, and rumourdly The Godfather, all succumbed to a similar result. <br/><br/>Following the cliffhanger of Reloaded, Revolutions fails to deliver what its successors could; namely: a decent plot. With a dull and boring script, this film drags from within the half-hour with minor appearances from the stars (i.e. Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving) leaving yourself to question why this film was made in the first place. Dramatic overacting on the part of minor-characters during overused gun sequences shifts the tone of this movie in a similar direction as Predator rather than the scintillating science-fiction narrative of The Matrix. Never mind the acting, the terrible choreography and extended action-scenes are over-dramatic, with each seeming like an experimental director trying to outdo the complexity of the first two films. With each dragging fight, you are left thinking to yourself: ""When is this going to end?"". The answer is never. The scars left by this movie leave senses of regret for two wasted hours, and moments that should conjure emotions of sadness or happiness, just conjure a feeling of relief that The Wachowski Brothers finally sparred us the torment of yet another cringy line. <br/><br/>The film tries to be philosophical and ""clever"" when it is in fact just seeming to use lines you find inside a fortune cookie. It is annoying and frustrating to see a seriously good franchise ruined by the greed to secure more profit for the company."

I agree with people who support the ""Matrix in matrix "" theory . That the real world itself is just another matrix , another form of control . It's the only way for the movie to make sense.<br/><br/>Anyway , this long awaited sequel is a little better than ""Reloaded"" . It has a little bit less of gibberish dialogue . The pacing also seems to be a little better . Special effects are great and almost all the action scenes are enjoyable (except the final fight between Neo and Smith). <br/><br/>Unfortunately , ""Revolutions "" fail because of one simple reason – the conclusion of the whole trilogy is  no conclusion at all . The only message that this movie seems to have is a tribute to faith . Any kind of faith . Of believing in yourself and your beliefs no matter what. Faith . And the true heroism isn't about punching and winning , but about making sacrifices. It is reflected in the words and actions of not only Neo , but other heroes ( Niobe , Morpheus , The kid ). <br/><br/>This actually would be good enough substance for many movies , but not for ""Revolutions"" . We were promised that the third movie will be a Holy Grail , that it will show us the meaning of live or something like that  In the end after all that hype , millions of dollars and hysteria the ending message seems to simplistic . Was there a real reason to make the ""Matrix"" sequels ? Did they had this conclusion prepared or they felt that they need to figure out something and they came with this ? You could do a great movie about faith and heroism without special effects , big budget and hype . The ending result seems like a disappointment. People are still trying to figure out about what the sequels were all about.<br/><br/>""Revolutions "" also has other problems . EVERY character that dies here has a long pathetic speech . The love story between Neo and Trinity that was so important during the trilogy wasn't believable or convincing even for a moment . The movie just like ""Reloaded"" suffers from too much style over substance , so in the end it feels very kitschy when Agent Smith and Neo are fighting like it was ""Dragonball Z"". There is also too much pathos and very little of real emotion. The movie doesn't add to much to the Matrix universe . It feels like they run out of ideas.<br/><br/>Disappointment . In the end it feels like I've been cheated and the whole thing is just a shinning piece of s***. Maybe ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" are deep philosophical movies and I'm too stupid to understand them . In my defense I'm not the only one who felt I was watching a philosophy lesson by Michael Bay. I give it 2/10."

"lagudafuad","5","2","3","31 March 2013"," just as low down as the second
","The Matrix Revolutions is suppose to the climax of this franchise, but in the end it ended up being the worse of the three, the movie actually brought the whole Matrix to an end, but in an anti climax kind of way.<br/><br/>The movie said to have cost close to the same as the second, The Matrix Reloaded but due to (my opinion) the lost of interest due to the fact that the second kind of takes you to a place where you have more questions than answers, you are left wondering what is the whole point, which could be the reason why this last one made like same as the first but like half of the second.<br/><br/>Also out of the three this had the lowest review rating. The movie draws you (well the second movie) to a point and tells you that all this has happened 5 times before now, so there is a possibility that things might not change and the matrix will reset and the war will continue, but this 6th reboot of the matrix is supposed to be different because in this new matrix love is involved. Neo's (Keanu Reeves) love for Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is supposed to be the difference between ""The One"" in this sixth matrix reboot and the others and the oracle believes that is all it will take.<br/><br/>The movie focuses more on change and the ability to trust yourself more than what is going on around you. In the end of the second we saw that Neo's power extends beyond the matrix into the real world. In the end of The Matrix Reloaded Neo fell into a coma because he used his power too soon in the real world and he got stuck in a place between the matrix and the real world.<br/><br/>The movie carries on for a long time keeping you at the edge of your sit, with Neo going up to face the source, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has practically taking over the matrix and the machines are closing in on Zion so for a long time you are kept at the edge of your sit as you eagerly wait to see how it will all play out in the end.<br/><br/>The visual effects here is not as captivating as it was in the second because it seems recycled, but there is one thing that is very captivating in the movie is the driving of Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) although you know it is all visual effect and CGI but they made it very high tense.<br/><br/>So at the end of the second and may not want to carry on (because I didn't), but I guess there is no point why not just finish it.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"patrickwigington","6","2","3","1 September 2012"," Reloading the Series
","Released only 6 months after Reloaded, the last film in the Matrix series is actually a pleasant surprise, especially considering the middle installment being exactly the opposite. While the movie leaves a lot of questions open, it serves as a satisfactory and exciting conclusion to the series.<br/><br/>While the second film was bogged down in a convoluted and draining script, Revolutions seems to have stripped the story down to its basic elements. Now, far removed from the bitterness of the disappointment of the Matrix sequels—which seemed to be on par with the general sentiment for the Star Wars prequels—Revolutions actually ends up being a much more emotional and spiritual climax than any of us probably remember. Although this movie picks up right where the last one left off—that is to say, in the middle of an embarrassing mess—The final film is way more entertaining and refreshing than Reloaded ever could have dreamed of being. <br/><br/>The reason, I think, that Revolutions was so ill received when it came out was for a number of reasons. First of all, the majority of the movie takes place in the real world, completely outside of the Matrix. The only time we are in the Matrix is when Trinity and Morpheus meet with the oracle to try and find out how to get Neo out of the in-between world he thrust himself into after realizing his powers work in the real world, and then one more time for the final battle. Also, the story goes in a very unexpected direction which left many people, myself included, feeling like it was the biggest anticlimax of any story. Neo is stricken blind by a man that has been possessed by Agent Smith, Trinity serves as only a dramatic character, and the film ends with peace between man, the machines, and the Matrix, rather than the annihilation of the last two. However, looking at it now, all of these things work in favor of the movie.<br/><br/>While Reloaded exploited the iconic nature of the first film with such stunts as having Neo fly, having Neo fight fifty Agent Smiths at once, having Neo manipulate the Matrix in every way imaginable, having Morpheus fight bad guys for fifteen minutes straight, and having the machines attack the Nebuchadnezzar again, Revolutions seems to throw off all of the iconic nature of the trilogy, and instead find a conclusion that is interesting and, surprisingly, in tune with all the mounds of philosophical ideas they built into the first one. <br/><br/>Zion is preparing for an all out machine attack, and deep down they know they will be making their last stand. Meanwhile, Neo and Trinity have taken a ship and are trying to make their way to the machine city. The battle takes up a majority of the movie, and the characters that were introduced in the second film serve as the focus of this part. The battle is certainly too long, but considering it has an emotional center, it is not nearly as draining and pointless as all of the fights in Reloaded. If the supporting characters had been more interesting, then the battle would probably have been more fun to watch, but what can you do.<br/><br/>One thing that is a striking blow to the movie is that Neo gets a little shortchanged in this. During most of the battle, and a long battle it is, we don't even cut to see where Neo and Trinity are. When we do, Neo fights the man that has been possessed by Agent Smith, but he is blinded in the process. No matter, because he can now see the world, or at least machines, as golden light. When they arrive at the machine city, their ship crashes, and Trinity dies. Neo then walks to a certain point, and meets the head honcho of the machine city. It turns out, Agent Smith has turned every single person in the Matrix into himself, and both Neo and the machine leader know only the Chosen one can stop him. Neo then goes into the Matrix, fights the Agent Smith that used to be the powerful oracle, and is then defeated. Neo's defeat then brings an end to the perceived glitch that was the Chosen one, and then the Matrix reboots. In the real world, Neo dies, and the war between humans and machines ends. We don't see what happens in the near future, or the rebuilding of society. We do know that now anyone who wants to unplug from the Matrix will be allowed to do so.<br/><br/>This story is obviously heavily influenced by religious texts and stories. Neo as a martyr for the freedom of humanity as opposed to the leader of a revolution completes his arch as a Christ-like figure. And the film leaves us by telling us that people plugged into the Matrix have a choice if they want to leave or not. That theme runs throughout the entire series, so it is fitting that is how it should end.<br/><br/>thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com"
"morganbraytnt","5","2","3","2 February 2012"," Why?
","It is hard to believe that the original Matrix's philosophical subtlety came from the same authors of the two sequels.<br/><br/>It seems the brothers must have cribbed the original story for the first Matrix, since the last 2 show none of the original's subtlety or interest, just rehashing and CGI multiplication.<br/><br/>One evil robot, two evil robots, many many evil robots. Wow, what an idea, what creativity! Viewing the behind-the-scenes on DVD disc 2, you can see the reasons for the incoherence of story and scenes - the huge fractured design team, numerous 'senior this' 'senior that', all contributing to some corporate creation lacking any inspiration. Maybe the corporate cube-farm culture works for making cars, but it doesn't seem to work for films.<br/><br/>I would have liked to have seen another level of reality exposed behind the mindless machines, and why are they so mindlessly evil when they can think up such a subtle ruse to enslave the humans? It isn't consistent. Why not introduce an alien ET culture who is really the master culture enslaving the machine culture by some similar hallucinatory ruse. Or, have the humans escape by transcending their bodies, as in all the traditional gnostic spiritualities.<br/><br/>All in all, the Matrix is just a retread of the movie TRON. TRON at least had some insight into what the machine mindset and motivation for domination might be, e.g. tyrannical game addiction, much like the decadent Roman emperors. The Matrix, after the first film, gives no thought to any subtle motivations of the machine culture, preferring the tired cliché of 'alien villain = mindless unrelenting violence'."

"mlg-t888","8","2","3","25 May 2009"," Everything that has a Beginning, has an End
","The stunning conclusion to the Wachowski brothers ""Matrix"" trilogy comes to life. Highly controversial at it's release, the film has since never quite redeemed itself in eyes of the fans of the series. As a side note, this film might receive better reception as time goes on, much like ""Alien 3"" although this is simply speculation.<br/><br/>The film begins almost the second its predecessor ended, Neo is unconscious, with the he's-got-to-be-up-to-no-good Bane lying right beside him. The film almost immediately throws itself back into the computer world with the revelation that the Morovingian isn't quite done with our leather-clad heroes yet.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting aspects of the film is the extended focus on the people of Zion. It frequently breaks away from the main characters to focus on the less developed ones which were introduced in the previous movie. While the ominous buzzing of the machines comes ever closer, the people of Zion prepare for what they know will be their final battle. I particularly liked the development of Kid, a character only briefly touched upon in ""Reloaded"" gets a nice portion of the spotlight while defending Zion.<br/><br/>While humans and machines clash, Morpheus, Niobe and their crew come to aid in the battle at their home. Niobe's character get's some well deserved development during this period, as her and Morpheus's stories come full circle.<br/><br/>One of the films only weaknesses is the lack of focus on Neo and Trinity, who are completely absent for a large portion of the film. Their characters never really undergo any development, with the exception of an extremely powerful sequence toward the end.<br/><br/>The reason that Revolutions, in my mind, was a success was because of the ending. The Wachowski brothers don't waste time showing what occurs afterwards, they simply end the story, telling it the way they wanted to tell it. This is one of the things I really like about the brothers, they don't sell out on their vision and let the film-making norms taking over their story. They tell their story, not the story that the audience EXPECTS or WANTS to see, but the story THEY want to tell, which is what film-making is really about.<br/><br/>If you are a die-hard fan of the Matrix or just a person who has a tendency to like deeply misunderstood movies, watch this."

While attempting to wrap up looses ends from the previous installments, it also has to provide closure on the overall saga as well as live up to the precedents set before it.<br/><br/>Was ""Revolutions"" a disappointment? Well, financially it performed much weaker than its big brother in ""Reloaded"" but otherwise, the answer remains a resounding ""no."" In fact, ""Revolutions"" slightly succeeds at besting the second film, as well as wrapping up the trilogy in a nice and neat manner.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Reloaded,"" the third installment carries more emotional weight rather than show off its visual marvels. There are two big action scenes that make up about a third of the film. One is a breath-taking invasion of Zion by the sentinels which is so good that you almost forget that we haven't seen our two main characters for the better part of a half-hour. The other, the final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith, is nothing short of epic. Thousands of Smith's clones watch in the streets and the buildings as the two duke it out mano a mano in the rainy streets of The Matrix. These two scenes best what was done in ""Reloaded"" and push the plot forward all the better, all the way to its inevitable conclusion.<br/><br/>Sure, the film's loaded with clichés and yes, it still has an overall feel and tone similar to ""Reloaded"" that doesn't sit well with the original film (Powerade, anyone?), but it's as close to a perfect closing chapter in the trilogy as we were ever going to get. It's got a grand feeling. It's both sentimental and definitive. There are very few franchises in Hollywood that end in a way that ensures there will be no more sequels to water down the formula, and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" ends in such a way that not only do you feel satisfied, but that simply, there is nothing left to be done. The Wachowski Brothers close out their trilogy with a bang, slightly redeeming itself while providing appropriate closure."
"alexx668","6","2","3","20 February 2009"," The Matrix mythos
","The bigger picture had already started taking shape in ""The Matrix Reloaded"", but there were still doubts amidst the pile of narratives, and of course in the vortex of the hyper action. But it's obvious in ""The Matrix Revolutions"". The Matrix trilogy is a sci-fi retelling of the Christianity fable. Slightly heretic perhaps, but it's the Christianity fable all the same.<br/><br/>Think about it. The Architect is God. He created the first perfect matrix which mankind rejected. Ring any bells? Yes, this is the original sin redux. Thereafter mankind lives in a kind of downgraded matrix that suits their needs and nature better. The agents/programs are God's angels so to speak. Neo, aka the saviour, might be another means of control, but he's the saviour nonetheless. Agent Smith is the angel that rebelled and freed himself; he's, ho-hum, an Antichrist of sorts.<br/><br/>The difference in the Matrix's Weltanschauung is that mankind has rebelled against the Architect, aka God. Mankind (or at least a part of it) wants out the matrix, out of the role-model of god's universe altogether. It chooses to. Essentially the Matrix trilogy depicts mankind as some sort of anomaly (to use the film's terms), eternally bound to be in conflict with something without even really knowing why - the establishment, it's own emotions, whatever.<br/><br/>The three films can thus be categorized as such: The first film is the introduction to the general idea and aesthetics. The second film is the culmination of the aesthetics, and the deviation and dilution of the idea into more interesting levels. The third film is the clearing up of the idea (and thus slightly disappointing), the decay of the overindulgent aesthetics, and the pompous pathos of the ultimate battle between Neo and Agent Smith."

The only thing I didn't like really like was that they didn't go into the Matrix as much. It was only the opening with the train station bit, and the final Smith battle. I liked this movie. It wasn't as horrible as everybody else says. I liked it a lot. So, if you saw the first two and like them, then see this one. Don't expect it to be as good as the first two, but you will like it. I know you will."

","I'm not sure why this film is so low rated, of the three Matrix films I feel this is the only one that lives up to the genius of the first and is almost, almost as good. I remember liking this in my teens when the film first came out so I recently went back to make sure my sentiment hadn't been complete hogwash brought on by excess youth. As it turns out I liked it even more than I expected.<br/><br/>The visuals this film gives are some of the best ever done in film, and bring the sci-fi world of the Matrix to life in incredible detail and beauty. If this isn't enough the film gives a spring-board of thought provoking dialog that likely explains why so many film-goers left disappointed, not everyone appreciates a little philosophy in their action film the way I do. Despite some confusing dialog and an at first (to me) ambiguous ending I feel this film is extraordinarily underrated...<br/><br/>Perhaps movie goers wanted to see more of the characters inside the Matrix, unfortunately that's not where the story takes place for the most part. I loved the Zion fights for survival story, the gritty colors and depressed faces tell of a distraught future where survival for humanity isn't guaranteed.<br/><br/>There are so many original and semi-original ideas within the Matrix Trilogy is boggles the mind, but where some see plagiarism I see genius. After all what is Star Wars but archetypes, ideas, motifs, all placed together in an original recipe, the chef did not invent the egg, but he did cook the omelet.<br/><br/>Themes of causality, purpose, choice, control, love, the very fabric of humanity is spoken of in this film, add that to the mind-shattering special effects and you have, in my mind, one of the best film series ever created, and Revolutions is right up there with the best sci-fi films ever made..."

","(Karthik Narayan) Knowing this was the final of the trilogy of the Matrix movies, which has revolutionized the movie world, the movie carried great hype in my mind and all across the globe.<br/><br/>After watching the movie, I realized it captured the very essence of Hinduism/ Buddhism and the way to reach life's ultimate goal  to find out the meaning of life itself.<br/><br/>Each one of us comes into this world with hopes, dreams and aspirations of attainment, what path we choose is our own. However, after a while, most of us get sidetracked by so many other things.<br/><br/>The immediate purpose of existence in this world is survival  now that is reality.<br/><br/>But the ultimate purpose of life is to find out the meaning and role of our lives. This will not happen if we stand in one spot and trust things will happen over time. It requires the belief in oneself to own up and go forth to find the glory of light.<br/><br/>For only the one who seeks with their hands raised to the sky and their feet moving along the earth can find their true destiny  and beyond darkness, there is light. We need to believe in the light that sparks up our lives and move towards it. This light is what we call the truth.<br/><br/>And the truth is not for us to seek but to make. For one writes his own truths and lies in life.<br/><br/>This movie seeks to bring to light all of this and much more. I got my enlightenment, watching the good vanquish the evil, sacrificing self to the truth. For it is a consuming factor, this truth.<br/><br/>Go watch this movie  and I am sure you will, beyond a shadow of doubt, be entertained and most importantly, enlightened.<br/><br/>Rating  6.5/10"
"SJ_1","4","2","3","3 October 2005"," A flawed film which ends the trilogy with a whimper.
","I was quite clear on what I thought about Reloaded, the action scenes inside the Matrix were good overall, but it was letdown by the scenes in Zion which I felt were mostly a waste of time. In that film, it didn't matter, I could sit through a few scenes I didn't like for the great car chase or the Architect scene. However in this film, I realised that Reloaded's flaws only emphasise the flaws in Revolutions.<br/><br/>Firstly, this film is all over the place as it is. Not enough time is spent on Neo who is the pivotal character of the trilogy, there are extremely long sequences just showing the war between man and machine in Zion, which definitely would have benefited from a few Neo and Trinity scenes as intermissions. The battle between the humans and the machines isn't presented well and it's boring to put it bluntly. However, it is made even worse by the fact that these characters fighting the machines were not developed enough in this film or the previous one.<br/><br/>Bottom line: The Matrix Revolutions is about a war between some humans and some machines which I just don't care about all that much. The Wachowskis had plenty of time to develop these characters in the opening section of Reloaded, and instead they wasted their time on a five-minute partying scene. By the time the war comes around, I don't know enough about these characters for it to sustain my interest in a short battle, let alone this massive attack on the city of Zion which takes up half of this film.<br/><br/>I was sitting bored in my seat during most of this film, because despite the visuals and special effects, I needed someone to root for during this battle, and the closest I got to this was the kid who was seen briefly during Reloaded.<br/><br/>This isn't the only gripe I have with the film, the whole thing is just bad to be honest. The ending to the trilogy was disappointing and underwhelming, as yet again the effects were great and everything, but I was expecting something really inventive to finish this whole trilogy off. Instead the final scene ends too quickly and it's predictable, recycling some of the ideas from the first Matrix film.<br/><br/>The Wachowskis failed big time on Revolutions, it lacks pretty much everything that made the first film exciting to watch, and everything that made Reloaded at least passable as a sequel. It's boring and doesn't deliver a satisfying ending to the trilogy after three films, tainting all the good memories of the previous two."

","You will rarely find any big-budget movies more venally opportunistic than the Matrix films. We've seen it all before in different packages: Pseudomystical claptrap about choice and fate; a machine intelligence and a beleaguered humanity with war between machines and people---reference the Terminator movies. Neo is blinded by Smith inhabiting Bane's body and so becomes able to ""see"" the pseudo-reality of the Matrix without jacking into it---reference Oedipus and the blind prophet Teiresias (hey, we have an actual glimmer of culture here!). But this is then interrupted by enough boring, overlong ultra-violent battle scenes, numbingly familiar pyrotechnics, and cheap-looking CGI for a shelf full of action computer games---which is in fact how this movie looks---and then how does it end? Like a Power Rangers show, with a one-on-one chopsocky fest in the rain that is no more advanced in inventiveness than the similar duel between Superman and Zod in Superman II. (You want to watch violence? Turn on CNN.) And then Neo wins out over Smith by becoming one with the computer intelligence---reference Decker and Ilia at the end of Star Trek: The Motion Picture.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves ends the series as he began it, with a performance worthy of an honors degree from the David Janssen School of Non-acting. His Muses are obviously the twins Hypomimia and Hypophonia. The relationship between Neo and Trinity has always been hindered by the fact that Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss have an on-screen chemistry that is tepid at best. Their lovemaking scenes in Matrix Reloaded were underwhelming. Furthermore, five years of Matrix movies have not been kind to Carrie-Ann Moss; she looks tired and haggard and has not aged well, although this actually fits her character, as you would expect the hard life of the unplugged humans in the Earth of the Matrix movies to do that to people. Mostly, however, she looks like she is bored to tears by what she is doing. Maybe that's why they brought in Nona M. Gaye to ""fill out"" the film, which she does quite well, if you get my meaning. Hugo Weaving pretty much steals the movie as Agent Smith. Too bad that the only other actor truly worth watching in the first two films, Gloria Foster as the Oracle, died before Revolutions was made and was replaced by Mary Alice, an actress of much less charisma. The handling of the introduction of the new actress, since it was common knowledge that Gloria Foster died, felt pretty lame.<br/><br/>The Wachowski brothers have vision, all right: It's TV-Guide, Reader's Digest, back-of-the-cereal box vision. It's a vision of movies that are as drearily derivative and as shamelessly exploitative as they come."
"Jexxon","1","2","3","19 August 2004"," Nothing worth seeing...
","The downward spiral from Reloaded continues in this dreary conclusion to the Matrix trilogy. In short, the biggest problem is that it shouldn't have been more than one film. The original brought new exciting visual effects, and a story that had some interesting points. Also, the blend of sci-fi, action, and a noir-ish visual look, oozed of COOL.<br/><br/>The sequels are just boring, and feel forced to begin with, as the first film pretty much showed everything you wanted to see, and managed a satisfying ending. Reloaded and Revolutions tries to expand on the mythology, and philosophy of the original resulting in a very heavy handed exposition of talky Oracles and Architects. It was much better just hearing about Zion, than seeing that it was basically a big cave where dreary zombies in a sort-of-Star-Trek counsel had endless discussions about if/why/where they would send ships. Suddenly, the audience was supposed to care about new characters (who does nothing more than look miserable) instead of following the heroes from the first Matrix (in this one Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus are mere supporting characters).<br/><br/>
Revolutions was hyped for having an awesome battle in Zion as well as one final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith - but both these ""highlights"" are just run-of-the-mill CGI frenzys, that cannot stand up to any of the action scenes in the first film. The Wachowskis' seem to have been blinded by their own excellence, and the thirst for making huge sums of money. In the process, they've forgotten what made the first Matrix so great. Like the latest Star Wars films, Reloaded and Revolutions fail to bring anything new onto the screen. <br/><br/>The actors don't look like they're having any fun, and neither had I. Parts two and three of this trilogy are simply best forgotten."

Sure, there was a hint of the metaphysical and philosophical BS which brought 'Reloaded' down a couple of notches, but it was not overly heavy handed.

"damanique","10","2","3","8 November 2003"," Excellent special effects, one for the fans, not the critics... expect a movie, not a miracle, and you won't be disappointed.
","WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW!!!<br/><br/>
About Neo, Trinity, and the both of them<br/><br/>Neo. He's The One if I ever saw One. I mean, of all the hero stereotypes, their troubles, their sacrifices, their motivations, their powers... Neo's top-class. He really is just the one, the messiah. Blind, cognitive and somewhat precognitive, like Paul Atreides / Paul Muad'Dib from Dune. Can destroy things by waving his hand, and make really high jumps, like Luke Skywalker. Who couldn't fly like Superman, but there you go, another hero stereotype. And he has all these martial arts moves, and every hero at least knows how to kick bad guy ass. And then there's the whole predestination. A lot of heroes have those. What I like about Neo though, is his human-ness. Despite all that hero stuff, and the strong tendency to sacrifice himself a lot, he's human. With doubts and fears. A lot less than in M1 and M2, but still.<br/><br/>This is where Trinity comes in. People wonder why the heck a movie like the Matrix needs a love interest beside the failsafe-function she has, and this is why. I've thought about it after my friend and I discussed it, and it makes sense to me. Again, it reminds me of the relationship between Paul Muad'Dib and Chani. And maybe, between Kenshin and Tomoe. If you look past the suggestive sheath-of-the-sword analogy, you'll see it makes sense. The hero, the man, the warrior, is the sword - unstoppable, dangerous, powerful. The woman (or man, if you prefer ;)), is the sheath. (Yes, I KNOW. Look beyond the obvious suggestiveness.) Without the sheath, the sword loses control. It has nothing to hold on to, and nothing to hold it back, and nothing that understands it. Chani, Tomoe, Trinity - they give their heroes what the heroes can't give themselves. Something that keeps them human, that keeps them more secure. Something that makes them go that extra mile, but something that holds them back from going too far. They're not just some ditzy women hanging around the main character. And despite that I find Trinity sort of annoying, mainly because there's just no chemistry between the actors themselves, I do realise that she matters in the story.<br/><br/>
Yeah... Carrie-Anne Moss and Keanu Reeves don't really seem to get along. You can just tell when actors get along well together; look at Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving (Smith); those two have more tension going on than the real couple. ;) You know what I mean. They act so well together, Neo and Smith. During conversation, during the fighting... whilst, when Neo and Trinity exclaim their love for eachother, I'm not always that convinced... acting is more than just saying lines. And on some level the viewer can also pick up that which isn't said or shown physically. Casting is important, also to see how the actors work together. That's why the Fellowship group from the LotR movies radiates their bond off the screen; those bonds aren't just acted, they're real. And the viewer sees that. And that's why Neo and Trinity probably don't make a great couple on screen. Story-wise, they're pretty amazing... but it doesn't seem to work out.<br/><br/>About Smithy<br/><br/>What can I say? Best 'Bent On World Destruction'-badguy since Sephiroth. Best maniacal laugh since I don't know who. Best glasses. Best smug arrogant sonuva-Artificially-Intelligent-Machine. Great acting. How can you not love Smith? I mean, besides wanting to destroy the whole world and all that. Like he said.. "" I'm not such a bad guy, once you get to know me."" Smith rocks. Period.<br/><br/>About the special effects ... Just be quiet, and hand me some sunglasses. Or pills to stop my brain from bouncing and something against these goosebumps. The special effects are awesome. The detail.. just.. wow. Unlike the somewhat wonky rendering of the Burly Brawl fight in M2, the special effects in M3 are near perfect. There's only a few bits that show the effects more obvious (odd anatomy, just a bit *too* slick)... but hello, an animation of Smith flying and fighting all dynamically in the air whilst it's raining and thunder strikes.. No, the effects are amazing. At one point you see a detail of a machine claw or leg.. which looks so good, all shiny and oily, it looks very realistic. I doubt it is a set prop, it might be, but if it's rendering.. then it's DAMN GOOD rendering. And unlike the newer Star Wars eps, for some reason, the special effects in M3 never become too much. But that's just me, of course. I can never get enough special effects and CGI animation.<br/><br/>
About the Matrix and anime<br/><br/>I recognise many many anime-ish things in it. The fighting, of course. The effects. The camera perspectives. The story itself. And I like it. They took a whole lot of things that are good about anime and stuck it into a huge and awesome movie. Thank you Wachowski Bros. :)<br/><br/>About the ending of the Matrix: Revolutions<br/><br/>The ending was... open. Sort of. It's not clear whether Neo is dead or not, and where his body is going. Whether he returns. How the machines and humans will live together. Etc. It's stuff fans will have to fill in on their own. I damn well hope so, because if there's going to be a fourth movie, I'm either going to explode with enthusiasm or kill the Wachowskis for milking the Matrix like a money cow. I've learnt something in the past though, and that's that writing endings to something is extremely difficult. The only ending to a story I ever finished is written horribly. Disregarding the Evangelion movies, the original last episode sucks too (Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations!) Some endings are good (Titanic), others are less good. But in general, endings are difficult. How do you finalize a story? How do you wrap up everything, yet leave enough to still keep people interested? On one hand, I would've liked to see more about what happened to Neo.. but on the other hand, maybe I'm better off guessing. Maybe I'm better off thinking he's in a happier place, having done his job and fulfilled his destiny. It's time to give him a break. But even then, I'm always interested in how society will fare after the ending. But I guess that is left up to the fans, the fanfic writers, and the Matrix RP-ers. Either way... I just wish the Oracle could've been a *little* more final and a *little* less vague at the end. 'Who knows' doesn't cut it, and neither does 'Maybe'. So the end wasn't that satisfying.. and leaves me thinking.<br/><br/>About all the movies together<br/><br/>I think they would work out best if you'd watch them all consecutively; or at least watch M2 and M3 consecutively. There's a noticeable gap between the first and the last two movies. Reloaded is the least good of the bunch. I reckon this is because it's the middle movie. The beginning is the beginning, and the ending is the ending, but the middle is just sort of hanging in between, you know? Plus there was a lot of philosophical stuff by the Architect, and the sex/rave scene of which I'm now willing to admit it might've been a tad too long. But not too long for the background music of that scene though!<br/><br/>If you don't like science-fiction, and you don't enjoy watching movies, then don't watch it, and let the fans enjoy it instead. ;P"
"Gideon40","10","2","3","8 November 2003"," Darker, more outrageous, and still great
","Its been expected that many people would not appreciate the Matrix Revolution. The series doesn't throw every answer in your face, therefore its probably the only major budget trilogy that requires lots of thinking to understand fully. People don't really expect this sort of thing from a big budgeted, much anticipated movie, and they hype it so much, expecting the movie to turn out the way they *expect* it to be. Then when the movie takes a different approach to what people expect, then people don't like it. Its not because of the movie that people say it sucks, its because of the people themselves. Its their expectations that cause it. Instead of having expectations, I accepted the storyline as it was told, and any elements of the story that people dismissed as ""loose ends that weren't tied up"" are explainable if you put some thought into it and keep an open mind.<br/><br/>Anyway, onto my review. Revolutions is an awesome movie that definitely takes a very different approach and has a very different feel. The first matrix was about awakening, and there was a balance of scenes in the real and matrix world. Reloaded took place mostly in the matrix, because its more or less the episode where Neo sets out on his prophesized purpose. Revolutions takes place mostly in the real world, where the events that happen in Reloaded force the humans to take up their last stand and just have a lot of faith. Just because Revolutions is not like the Matrix doesn't mean its bad, it just means its different. The movie has less talkative than Reloaded, but it still gets its message across. The action is simply over the top and very pleasing to the eye, with scenes like the super brawl where Neo and Smith fight in what I can only describe as one of the most outrageous and compelling fights ever. While this fight is not as lightning fast and complex as the Burly Brawl, it defintely has a very epic feel to it, with punches and kicks being magnified and Neo and Smith made to look like two gods in human bodies in a grand showdown. I said in my Reloaded review that it didn't hold back its creativity. Revolutions simply unleashes every ounce of it. The zion battle, because it takes place in the real world, does not feature any humans flying or doing fantastic feats, therefore it has a more down to earth feel. Still, it is probably the most intricate and overwhelming science fiction war scene, with, I can tell you right now, MILLIONS of sentinals flying around while the humans fight a desperate battle to hold them back. Let me tell you, if you don't think to yourself ""oh sh**"" when you see the giant swarms of sentinals, you're either too arrogant for your own good or there's something wrong with your head. The opening club shootout, as much as it was short, was awesome. It definitely makes the lobby scene in the first matrix look average, as it has people flying around, walking on the walls, and of course, shooting. All this to tune of an awesome techno rhythm. The action scenes in Revolutions, like Reloaded, are too excellent for words and definitely transcend any action scene filmed in any other movie in terms of creativity and coolness.<br/><br/>
That takes care of the action. Now the story. The story here is definitely darker and has more despair. As you will come to realize, the movie brings forth the Matrix Trilogy's christian elements. One such element is the whole idea of faith. Despite having an army of sentinals coming at them, despite Neo not stopping them before they reach Zion, and despite how nobody knows what they can do other than fight a losing battle, it is ultimately faith that pushes Neo to do something about it, and it is faith that allows the people of zion to have the courage to fight. Probably the most contraversial thing about the Matrix Trilogy, now that it is concluded, is the ending. SPOILERS... At the end, Neo fools smith into copying him, but what smith doesn't realize is that Neo, as the oracle explained, is essentially neo, except they're the yin and yang of each other. In order for one to exist, so must the other. Thus, when Neo is copied, and ceases to exist, the balance is gone and so is Smith. I thought that idea was genius. I didn't get it at first, but like I said earlier, I thought about it, and all was explained. After that, the machines stick to their end of the bargain, and really do, this time, give them a choice, and stop attacking them. The humans and machines live in the same world, and while the machines still exist, they are neutral to the humans instead of hostile. This ending, I thought, was perfect. It brings about the Yin Yang idea present with Neo and Smith. Also, if the film ended with the humans winning everything, the sun clearing up and so on, people will say it was too happy. If it ended with a downright bad ending, that would have eliminated the whole point of the movies. So whats wrong with something thats in the middle? This sort of ending was perfect and is also different, because not a lot of movies end like this, where the good guys and bad guys stop fighting and simply live out their lives independently, instead of one destroying the other. I suppose some people are asking 'why would the machines stop attacking? Now that neo's dead, why don't they just forget about the whole deal and destroy zion?"" The answer is very easy. As the architect put it, ""What do you think I am, human?""<br/><br/>All in all the Matrix is a great trilogy. People who didn't understand the film and refuse to think about the ending will complain endlessly and dismiss it as typical hollywood trash, but in my opinion I doubt there's ever been a major budget, hugely publicized trilogy thats had such a complex, intricate story, over the top action, and overflowing creativity. It is a terrific way to end the Matrix movies, but trust me, the story will not stop there. I gladly give this a 10/10."

","I saw the movie last Saturday, and I've been trying to decide what i thought about it ever since then. Everyone came out of our theatre with a ""Ho-hum"" look on their face. This was not the ""balls-to-the-wall"" action film we all envisioned. I know it's certainly not what I expected. Therefore I am totally torn on my feelings for the film. On one hand I thought it was cool way to end the series, on the other hand, it seems there is so much more that could have been done to make this a better movie. There is no clear ending here, I won't give it away, but those who have seen it know what I'm talking about. We're just supposed to accept that some things happened after the end of the film, and in my opinion that boils down to bad filmmaking. Then I start wondering if it was intentional. The Matrix movies have always been about thinking and elusive meanings and dialogue, but it still seems that there should have been some attempt at a true ending. Now to the fights, these are spectacular. Spectacular, other than the first fight with Morpheus, Trinity, and Seraph against the Merovingian's goons which seems to me like a rehash of the lobby scene in the first movie, but then we get to the good stuff. The Zion dock fight is a new step in the right direction for CG mixed with live action, this thing is a beauty to behold and one of the best parts of the film. The superfight at the end is astonishing as well, as we finally see the two most powerful characters in the Matrix mythos go at each other like there's no tomorrow. Agent Smith is now totally enshrined as my favorite character of the entire trilogy, and he ranks up there with Darth Vader as one of my favorite villains in film history. Hugo Weaving shines here, and I hope will get some much deserved credit for his portrayal of Smith. The movie though is a totally mixed bag; it's better than Reloaded but not as good as the original which set the bar so high that it's hard to surpass. It will definitely take multiple viewings to sort all of this out and decide just how this film was meant to work. There's way too much to think about here. I think that if people give it a second chance and not just dismiss it after the initial viewing they will find more to love here, but only time will tell."

It's a mediocre action movie straight out of the early nineties. too long, bad editing, wasted actors, and the worst dialogues to hit any screen anywhere this year. what is this? did the writers watch too many soap operas. every single cliche you can imagine is up there on the screen. you know half an hour in advance who is going to die. and - yes - all the fighting and action stops for a couple of minutes to give the dying some time for an heroic speech - everytime.<br/><br/>as for the solution to the matrix triology....jesus...what is it all about??? too many loose strings not tight up, nothing makes sense, and far too much boring talk. they go on and on about love and machines bla bla bla...nothing you haven't heard before. and for the action??? not enough and not good enough. ok, the final fight is kind of interesting. but it's too late in a really bad film to save anything. oh, and trinity definitely deserved a better ending!!!!<br/><br/>Please, don't got and see this film! Don't support those involved in ruining everything we loved about the original matrix!!!"
"Offworld_Colony","6","1","1","14 February 2020"," The only way to defend The Matrix Revolutions is that in 2003 they had never before charted this two films shot back to back/shared media universe.
","And although Reloaded/Revolutions paved the way for the many sagas to follow, the 'concluding' chapter is a painful reminder of the crushing demands of a blockbuster schedule, the diminishing returns of the Wachowski's unique, oddball, counter-culture proclivities, and the continued curse of the third film.<br/><br/>For starters, the pacing is all off. If this was the second part of a mini-series, watched a week later, it would be perfectly fine, as a blockbuster cinema experience it's flat. It starts flat, it's boring and lumpy, convoluted and pallid at the same time. It has big chunks of exposition where Neo literally asks 'what the hell is going on' to which he gets 0 actual answers and, if anything, more confusion.<br/><br/>Then the upfront action is a pale, poor and almost comical turgid retread of the lobby scene complete with Trinity's watered down signature kick, bullets spray about making them all look useless and each section is diced and spliced in between rushed, chopped up sequences where a lot of the best and most interesting action happens off screen.<br/><br/>You know, there's some tremendous performances, theatrical readings of the theatrical dialogue; particularly the new Oracle and the scene with Smith. Agent Smith himself is one of the perfect evil supervillains of cinema history; foreboding, watchable, likeable, campy and utterly inevitable. The actor playing Bain who has a sort of dual consciousness going on with Smith is hilarious and pleasurable to watch, an idea underutilised but that could explode the lore so much if focussed on.<br/><br/>So the battle for the dock is mixed bag, an uninspiring, drab location with uninspiring, drab characters up against some elite mech action and VFX that still holds up, expertly crafted, with some truly terrifying hellishly beautiful images and great beats with the unique villainous squiddies. It's neither good nor bad, loud, long, but as well made as any war in any movie. If only they managed to utilise the main characters instead of these chumps.<br/><br/>The final battle is pure anime, unstoppable force and immovable object doing their dance through some cracking locations. It's unique to live-action (at least until the vastly inferior Man of Steel came along) and although it hasn't got the energy, kineticism and force of the first Matrix, it's a fitting end for these two equal and opposites. It's truly one of the greatest depictions of gods clashing that I've ever seen. It's 100% Mount Olympus.<br/><br/>So there's a glut of excruciatingly detailed and iconic imagery and design work. Some deliciously rousing and unique music. Some of the best surround sound I've ever heard. Some stirring, leftfield themes and ideas. And the rest is just bunk."

","Sure action, Keanu and plot were interesting but the execution wasn't that great... Especially after the first diamond of the trilogy... It is very entertaining, with good fight scenes good CGI good dialogues but it lacks some elements to make it unforgettable...

"weareone1111","10","1","1","19 December 2019"," No Christ here...
","This is based upon Joseph Campbell's the Hero's Journey, which isn't a tale exclusive to Christian Mythology; the story of Christ is a story of many cultures detailed through many different figures, predating that of Christ. We can't find historical proof on Christ because Christ is a mythological tale of each of us. Rather than breaking this down, those that actually care should research Campbell's work (the same model was used in the original star wars trilogy with Luke Skywalker as the Hero). The ending of this film speaks upon a return of Neo, which means there is more philosophy to explore (quite obvious that these movies didn't cover it all when one researches the source material). This was a conclusion as much as it was a bridge; enjoy it for what it is. When the Matrix 4 comes out, I believe perspectives will change upon this movie."
"iranu-74195","9","1","1","4 December 2019"," Maybe it wasn't the peak fans dreamt of - but it is still rich and absorbing
","Much of the complaining, in my opinion, is from really dedicated fans that have become so heightened in their previous enjoyments, engagements and expectations that they (understandibly) wanted the Moon on a Stick. It's a tribute to the Matix concept, that they expect so much. I will equate Matrix with The Lord of the Rings trilogy: 3 films that pull fans this way and that .. but a body of work that puts so much of the competition firmly in the shade. Wouldn't is be great if many more movies were so passionate and original as these? Matrix Revolutions - great stuff, years ahead of itself -- but more imporatantly made with real passion."
"simassey-09094","7","1","1","6 February 2019"," A disappointing end
","The flaws of the previous sequel are more readily apparent here as the focus shifts to the ""real"" world which is populated largely with uninteresting characters that were poorly developed in the previous film. As before, the film is stronger when it focuses on what is going on in the Matrix and Neo's own struggle to understand his role and the fallout from his discoveries. It is a shame then that most of the plot centers around a large scale assault on Zion that quickly becomes tiresome as characters who we care little about face off against an overload of CGI machines that really needed cutting down. That the film grinds to a halt in its biggest action sequence says a lot about how badly thought through this part of the film was and without the juxtaposition of scenes within the Matrix that made the ""real"" world sequences bearable in the last film, it never really recovers from it, even if it does improve slightly as it shifts its focus back to Neo. It doesn't help that whereas in the last film plots elements from the ""real"" world were rushed, here it's the elements related to the development of the Matrix that feel rushed and forgotten about for large parts of the film which make the final sequence difficult to care about. It's not unwatchable by any means, but as the culmination of a trilogy it can't help but disappoint."
"tabuno","6","1","1","25 January 2019"," A Decent, but Uninspiring Movie
","11 November 2003. Revolutions offers nothing revolutionary. While it has an amazing battle sequence along with the usual special effects driven ending, this Alien-like, Superman, insect-horror film fails to live up to its beginnings and push the envelope of science fiction and the nature of the Matrix-inspired set-up leaving up some great possibilities of hard-core sci fi razzle-dazzle. Enjoyable as an action sci fi film, it nevertheless never comes up to the potential that the Matrix trilogy could have been. Six out of Ten Stars."

"zkonedog","7","1","1","11 March 2017"," A Better Ending After A Muddled Middle
","After being so disappointed/confused with ""The Matrix Reloaded"" after seeing it in the theater in 2003, I didn't even see this film on the big screen when it came out, instead renting it once it came out on home video. After viewing, I realized that I missed the wrong Matrix film to skip for a long period of time.<br/><br/>Whereas ""Revolutions"" does not come close to the first film in duplicating the originality of the idea, it superbly triumphs the sub-par second film by eliminating much of the philosophical mumbo-jumbo and instead focus on a plot that the average viewer has a chance to understand.<br/><br/>Essentially, two things happen during the course of this film (I liken it to the Lord of the Rings series, where Frodo/Sam do their thing while the rest of Middle Earth fights Sauron): First, the city of Zion braces for (and eventually does engage) the approach machine army. The special effects in the war scenes are pretty incredible...not anything we haven't seen before, but not even as close to as faky as those in ""Reloaded"". The other plot line sees Neo and Trinity traveling deep into the heart of Machine City, where Neo ultimately has his final confrontation with the seemingly unstoppable Agent Smith. That final showdown is so intense (and so awaited) that it will raise the hairs on the back of your neck!<br/><br/>Overall, then, this film falls somewhere in between the originality of the first installment of the trilogy and the over-the-top sequel. Upon the conclusion of ""Revolutions"", I (and I consider myself to be an above-average viewer of science fiction) was still a bit confused as to what had exactly transpired, but not the utter sense of confusion I felt after viewing ""Reloaded"". Instead, ""Revolutions"" prompted me to check out what people were saying on the Internet, and eventually I did grasp the fundamental concept of what had happened.<br/><br/>So, if you were extremely disappointed by ""Reloaded"" and vowed to never view another Matrix film ever again, I strongly suggest that you give this one a try, as it completes the story of Neo in way that you can understand (even if it MAY take a little extra help from Internet scribes!)."
"Floated2","3","1","1","18 February 2017"," Very disappointing and unsettling conclusion
","Like many have stated and has been widely considered, the Matrix film is a classic and has been spawn on and praised for generations. Then comes the Matrix Reloaded which was not quite at the level of the original, but that was expected seeing as how great and game- changing the original was. Though Reloaded is still entertaining and there is enough to like about this film, it continues the great relationships with Neo and Trinity and we still have the same great concept. Now within the third installment and conclusion of the series The Matrix Revolutions, this film has been criticized throughout and one can see why. The film as a whole is disappointing because it does not feel as a typical Matrix film compared to the previous two. Revolutions feels more of a bland video game based film or another completely different type bland action film. <br/><br/>In the Matrix Revolutions, what is disappointing is knowing it's the finale of the series, and this is what the directors and writers came up with. There are some okay scenes but this film felt a little more mainstream and family friendly. Another reason why Revolutions is hated is because Neo isn't as focused in this film compared to the previous two. There is far too much time on the other minor characters and in the Zion levels. They simply aren't interesting and we do not care much about them. When we get to those scenes, this film drastically shifts and feels like a video game or action monster type film- and that is not what the Matrix is about. The previous two (specifically the original) were clever, suspenseful and made the viewers on their toes. In Revolutions, the suspense and build up is gone.<br/><br/>The final showdown scene with Neo and Agent Smith was decent for what it was, as it was well directed and the special effects are brought in nicely. Though it feels almost bland in a way that this was the pay- off for the entire film. We all knew Neo was going to win, as the fight was well but rather predictable. Overall, the Matrix Revolutions is a disappointment and a sad mess."
"Cameronius_113","5","1","1","10 December 2016"," An underwhelming conclusion
","This movie feels like it was a chunk cut out of another film; barely anything happens- resolve the cliffhanger at the end of the previous film, main protagonists split up- some fight robots, others participate in the final fight, the end. This also seems to have a similar story pattern to Return of the Jedi. Some plot points in the movie seem useless like the bit at the start resolving the cliffhanger of Reloaded. It has no effect on the rest of the story and seems so slapped in and out of place. The new characters introduced in that part are never seen again afterwards and serve no purpose to the story. Also, many plot points seem rushed: Trinity dies (yes, I did say spoilers) and as she is a major character you would expect it to have more of an effect than what was given; after the scene it never appears to be brought up again. Some of the action seems off too- the first fight scene between Neo and Smith isn't good. There are loads of flashing lights so you can barely tell what is going on and the camera is really shaky too. Compare it to all of their other fight scenes in the trilogy and you just start to wonder what on earth went wrong there. At least their final fight was alright. Many people don't like the ending but I personally thought it was fine and probably the best way to end it; Neo's sacrifice seemed fitting and kind of gave him a new reason of being 'The One' for me which I liked. You can only really watch this movie if you've seen the other two as it is just a conclusion. There also isn't really much point of rewatching it as the point of watching it for me is to just find out the ending and not for the overall experience like the other two. Overall, this movie isn't that good. If you want to see the conclusion to the Matrix trilogy or that cliffhanger from Reloaded is really bugging you then I'd probably recommend this just to find out what happens and not for the overall experience. However, if you're just wanting to watch any movie at all then this one doesn't have the amount of fun the first two had and I'd probably give it a miss. 5.8/10"

This was better established in The Terminator. Picking up where Reloaded left off, Neo awakens in a subway station where he is trapped outside the matrix and the train refuses his entry. Meanwhile Trinity, Morpheus and others set to rescue him while continuing the war against the machine army. Once Neo is rescued the screenplays descends into constant action, blazing violence and special effects that seem to go on and on. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski who provide us with superb visual spectacle that is rushed to release too soon. Worse than the previous sequel with a disappointing ending just to add to insult. Keanu Reeves returns again as Neo with Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity. Their introduction is well established until it becomes constant bang bang and the low blow ending. Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus is reduced to a cardboard performance. Hugo Weaving as agent Smith throws out lines fit for a Saturday Night Live comedian. Jada Pinkett is also underused to the point of just showing up because she wasn't lucky enough to be in the original. Any spiritual parallels take a backseat to production values. Score: 3 / 10"

","""The Matrix Revolutions"" suffers from the same problems that plague ""Reloaded"", although this time there's an unshakably depressing tone. The movie has a sort-of hopeful ending, but it's still a major downer, and the core three characters deserved better. And a sizable chunk of the movie's running time is spent on the garish Zion scenes (sure, that's where the film's humanity is, but I kept wanting to return to the admittedly more striking world of the Matrix).<br/><br/>But the movie's preoccupied with the idea of Neo and Smith as two variables in a larger equation. And the weird thing is that, for that larger theme and for all of the fight moves and bullets fired, everything comes down to an underwhelming Superman fistfight.<br/><br/>It shouldn't be this boring.

"AaronCapenBanner","3","1","1","15 December 2013"," The War Concludes
","The Wachowski Brothers returned to direct this conclusion to the trilogy as Neo(played by Keanu Reeves) finds himself trapped on a train station, which is the mid-point between the real world and the Matrix.

","Connor Macgregor Reviews...The Matrix Revolutions<br/><br/>So as I wrap up my shocking and controversial review of The Matrix Trilogy,i would just like to say i have no regrets over my last review and no regrets over this review.<br/><br/>So after just finishing the film off i can say that i enjoyed this as equally as Matrix 1. I say that because The story was wonderful.It wrapped up the story it introduced in 1 and 2 with a somewhat satisfying conclusion.Some may say the ending was anti-climatic.OK it was rushed but not anti-climatic.We understood what happened and what apparently was going to happen next.They could make a Matrix 4 but why bother.I think it ended pretty well off and needs not to continue.<br/><br/>The battle between The Machines And The Humans needs mentioning because i did enjoy the fight until maybe the bit when Commander Lock bit the bullet.That was when i got bored and wanted back to Neo/Trinity.Never the less it was great to see Zion again and see that long awaited fight we had been waiting for.<br/><br/>Speaking of long awaited fights,I was let down by Smith & Neo's final battle.I wish they would quit with the effects (Which now look like a PS3 Cut Scene) and do more action hand to hand combat.That was a weakness of the film.Barely any Fighting besides the Last Fight at the end which was as I said a let down.<br/><br/>Star of the film i am once again throwing to Hugo Weaving.His screen time i must think was decreased in this film and yet he still is the shiny coin in the bag.<br/><br/>So overall a good conclusion to a great Science Fiction Trilogy.I ain't going to say which is my favourite because of ....you know.But i enjoyed watching this trilogy and if i ever want to i will happily watch it again.<br/><br/>Overall Rating - 72% = B+ - ***.5 Stars"

","Watched it last night again after a few years. It is not a bad movie and it can't be called a disaster, but I feel the original story presented in The Matrix was twisted too much and the whole trilogy now has a stigma of being very complicated and confusing (and after The Matrix that wasn't the case, it was very clean in terms of plot and characters, such movies should be very clear on the good guys/bad guys division). While The Matrix introduced a relatively believable plot and sci-fi concept, this third sequel spins out of control. That ""world between the two worlds"" makes no sense and also Smith being able to enter a human mind makes no sense. You could see machines reading peoples minds and creating dreams for them (which the matrix is, a delicately constructed dream for all humans), but not themselves becoming human minds. Also, too many characters, I don't see any added value in the Frenchman/Monica Bellucci subplot except for more fights and more loud music. While I can see that The Matrix ""asked"" for a sequel, I don't think it asked for a whole trilogy. The Matrix Reloaded was a nice one with some memorable scenes, but the third one is boring, dark, too slow and way to complicated for an action sci-fi flick."

This film lacked the ingenuity and breakthrough qualities of the original Matrix leaving it simply an action film rather than continuing with its ability to mentally stimulate the audience.

"ShinKyo81","7","1","1","19 April 2004"," The end of all things...
","(Spoilers through all the review)<br/><br/>After having the big disappointment with ""The Matrix Reloaded"" (MRL), I ""freed my mind"" and went to watch ""The Matrix Revolutions"" (MRV)with hope. Because I really liked the first part of the trilogy, but despite I knew the other parts were conceived as a single movie, I couldn't let myself think that MRL was somehow incomplete and abruptly ended. So I thought: ""let's avoid any MRV trailer or spoiler or anything"", so I went to the cinema without expectations. And it worked, because I rather enjoyed the movie, even I still think the first part is the best one.<br/><br/>MRV begins exactly where MRL ended, with Neo and Bane lying in comma. The first movie was about ""birth"", the second about ""life"" and MRV about ""death"". ""Ergo"" ^_^U, the third installment of the Matrix trilogy is the darkest one: the machines'imminent attack, Neo trapped between the real world and the matrix world, Smith growing stronger... I feel it's kinda climatic movie and it's obviously dumb to see it if you definitely hated MRL, because they're a single movie.<br/><br/>The plot is quite good; however, the preparations for the Zion invasion are very long. It's quite interesting how dark the Matrix world becomes as Smith absorbs more people. I've read several opinions from other reviews about Hugo Weaving overacting... IMHO, I think his performance is great like Keanu's. They're opposites and Neo's to be very good and Smith very bad, in order to ""balance the equation"". Trinity's death was quite shocking... I couldn't believe she had died, I felt very sorry for Neo, after saving her in the Matrix world, it was a very sad moment. When everything seemed to be lost, Neo gets plugged into the Matrix to confront again his nemesis Smith. The scene between them is incredible, very influenced by Dragon Ball Z, but it rocks anyway.<br/><br/>The special effects are better than MRL: the squid invasion into Zion, the APUs, the Machine City (aka. 01), the Neo vs Smith final scene (aka. Super Browl)...<br/><br/>Don Davis' score is amazing, I really like the music theme of the whole trilogy, quite unique so when you listen to it you directly relate it to the Matrix without hesitating. Maybe I missed some non-instrumental songs in the score, but the ""Neodämmerung"" song is breathtaking, perfect for the ""Super Browl"" scene.<br/><br/>To sum up, ""The Matrix Revolutions"" concludes the Matrix trilogy with several unresolved plot holes, in order to continue earning money with the Matrix fever. Because this is what it's all about. Despite what the Wachowski bros. say, the Matrix should have had no second nor third part. But when you see money ahead... you go after it. Good for the directors and producers, but bad for the fans who wanted a fair continuation for the first film. Instead, we got ""The Matrix Reloaded & Revolutions"".<br/><br/>Anyway, worth a looking. :) 7/10"
"Bailiff","2","1","1","19 November 2003"," Not so good
","Wow, this may go down in history as the most unsatisfying final act in movie history. The Matrix Revolutions is hopelessly convoluted, weirdly uninteresting, Completely humorless, and entrenched in the excessive CGI-laced hokum of a thousand other nauseatingly stupid action movies. But at least many of those are self-aware in that they're bad, and thus know when to have fun.  Revolutions seems to be under the impression it's elevated above those in some capacity.  The fact is, if this movie wasn't riding on the coattails of its predecessors, it wouldn't even be a blip on the blockbuster radar.<br/><br/>And it shouldn't have been this lame.  The original film was stylish, inventive, and threw in some intriguing philosophy to boot.  It wasn't a masterpiece, but it definitely set a new standard for all action movies that followed it.  Its sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, was more of the same, just more grandiose and even more confusing for those who had trouble understanding the first film's mechanics.  It was also pretentious in some ways and in desperate need of editing.  But it was still GOOD, it still worked when all was said and done, if for no other reason than that the action sequences were spectacular (although the Neo human-to-CGI transformations were jarring and painfully obvious).<br/><br/>Revolutions, on the other hand, is a mess.  With the exception of Morpheus and Agent Smith (and, however brief his scenes, the Merovingian), none of the series' characters were very interesting.  Here, they're flat-out unlikable because not only are they boring, they're weirdly stupid and spout incredibly cliched lines.  Those who played the video game Enter the Matrix might see something worthwhile in Ghost and Niobe and ""the Kid"" is from a sequence in the Animatrix, but who cares?  Unlike Star Wars, where the minor characters usually looked cool or had funny voices, the ""Expanded Universe"" cast here are all useless talking heads, amalgams of soldiers from countless WWII shoot-em-ups or human Jar Jar wannabes (at least Jar Jar was cute for small children.  The Kid is apparently some sort of obnoxious replacement for Mouse from the original).  The dialogue is simply god-awful throughout the entire film.  Any scene that starts out interesting always ends up flat. Characters come and go without a trace, many of whom who were from Reloaded and who fans assumed would be a large part of this entry.  Not so, instead they're wasted, being only involved in scenes that are pretty much time-fillers: the ""Rescue Neo"" sequence serves almost no point and does nothing to advance the plot, instead it's a vehicle for a dull shoot-out and token cameos from the Merovingian and Persephone (and what was the point of the Trainman?!)<br/><br/>The movie goes downhill (moreso) from there.  Lots of goofy-looking Mechs ripped off from Aliens shoot a lot of squiddies.  Characters die, the audience blinks in indifference; after all, there's no development of their personalities, so why care what happens to them?  I ended up rooting for the machines because 1: they look cool and 2: if they did succeed in destroying Zion, no one would have to suffer through another ""rave scene"" ever again. Neo discovers his destiny a la Luke Skywalker or Aragorn after more needless scenes (they truly serve no purpose, I'm not kidding), but the setup to this is not adequately explained so many will be scratching their heads.  The problem is that even if you do care enough to understand fully the events leading up to this movie's huge letdown of a finale, you'll still likely not give a hoot because the story's major players are lifeless; even Morpheus is now Chewbacca in this one (which I guess makes Niobe a very hot Han Solo, also Jada Pinkett Smith is the only actor on the human side who shows some resistance to monotony, as her lines are delivered with genuine passion). Hugo Weaving and his identical buddies gnash their teeth a lot.  Mary Alice as the Oracle sounds like Barbara Walters, and her proselytizing has become tiresome.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Revolutions is proof that The Matrix franchise had nowhere to go after Reloaded.  The entire series is like a particularly unusual three-course meal: first a tender filet mignon, followed by an after-dinner salad, but ending with a partially melted Junior Size Three Musketeers bar. That's the Matrix Revolutions in a nutshell."

","****SPOILERS ABOUND****<br/><br/>
For quite some time I had very high expectations for this movie but right before watching them I read some reviews with very low expectations, which made me lower mine in turn.  I'm not one to agree with everything that critics have to say, but I take everything with a grain of salt and often find that when I do lower my expectations I enjoy the movie more.  Such was the case with Revolutions.  There were many great things in Revolutions, such as the special effects (especially some of the makeup effects), soundtrack, and dark overtone.  Hugo Weaving's acting was supurb and I was rivited every time he took the screen.  However, there were many things that made this film very mediocre for me.  First off was the acting by some of the more major characters.  Trinity, Morpheus, and Neo all seemed very shallow and one dimensional.  In contrast, some of the more minors characters seemed to have much more depth and complexity.  Much of the dialogue was very poor and I often found myself anticipating the next line, especially between Neo and Trinity.  The movie was very predictable for the most part.  From the start I knew that Trinity would die, Smith would be erradicated, and Zion would be saved.  The only thing I wasn't sure about was the fate of Neo, which I figured out after they started making Christ references.  The largest problem I had with this film is that it waxed way too philisophical for me.  I have no problem with philosophy but I feel that film makers today beat the Christ references into the ground.  Instead of thinking of something original they fall back on the same old 2000 year old story.  George Lucas did the same thing in The Phantom Menace by refering to Anikin as a Christ figure (ie high midichlorian count, immaculate conception).  As a result I quickly lose interest since I pretty much already know their fates.  (At least Lucas corrupted his messiah)  Movies that make people think about their lives and the universe are great things, but Revolutions did not explore anything new.  Many of the theories set forth are hundreds of years old.  The Matrix itself was first concieved by Descartes (although he did not call it the Matrix but the Deceiver).  The first Matrix was spectacular because it gave a modern spin to Descartes theory by trying to break away from the deceivers grasp.  Two movies later though, there have been no new ideas or advances on the theory, just the concept of Neo as Christ thrown in.  If there's going to be philosophy in a trilogy they should not give all of the theory away in the first movie, otherwise it will get stale and the action will be responsible for picking up the slack.  To the film makers' credit though, The Matrix was never supposed to have a sequel.  What's the conclusion after all this rambling? Great special effects (although some were a little over the top), superb job by Hugo Weaving, and excellent soundtrack.  Badly written dialogue, stale acting from the other major characters, and cliches abound.  I give it 5/10. I'm not saying don't see it, just be prepared for a lot of mediocrity if you've ever thought about what life means."
"Mrcheeks","7","1","1","10 November 2003"," The ending was a major disappointment
","The Matrix Revolutions is said to be the final installment of the Matrix movies and is said to close out the series. As entertaining as it was it leaves the viewer with unanswered question as the first two did but in a whole different sense. The film certainly puts to rest the rumors that Zion city was part of the matrix. It also has a climactic ending for the future of the city and the battle between Neo and Agent Smith BUT WHAT BECOMES OF NEO??? What becomes of the Matrix world now that the people it contains will have the option to be free...what is to become of those people?<br/><br/>
All in all it was a good movie but it leaves too many questions with infinite answers we shouldn't be stuck pondering. Quite simply the answers are boring to imagine with the gaping wound of an ending we are left to close. I myself would bet even if it's not for 5 years there just may be ONE final installment. This films plot was simple, the storyline simple and the ending was also very very simple. There was less explanation of things and the films primary action was the battle with the robots. Not a lot of hyped up Kung-Fu fights in this flick. Anyone satisfied by this movie as the final installment has low standards and wasn't expecting or asking for much at all for their dollar. That's quite sad really. Synapsis: dull storyline, great action and the thinnest plot of all three movies. I very much enjoyed it but was left feeling unsettled by the ending and yes some what disappointed."
"Quinoa1984","4","1","1","10 November 2003"," Simply there were things I liked and things I didn't like- arguably 'Revolutions' is the least in the Matrix films
","SPOILER WARNING<br/><br/>Andy and Larry Wachowski still get credit from me for their last installment in their Matrix movies - Revolutions (this following the well-intentioned if imperfect Reloaded and excellent first one) - in terms of storytelling. The one thing that kept me awake through much of this film was that I knew they were taking me to somewhere where I wasn't entirely certain. However, that was the only thing that made this installment worthwhile for my money.<br/><br/>
There are two other elements that I wish to address: the visual effects and action sequences, while technically complex and detailed, didn't HOLD me on to my seat, so to speak, like in the last two films. The first Matrix was a breakthrough in its own visual style and technique, and Reloaded admirably tried to push it a little further. However I sensed in Revolutions that there was no where remarkable to go in the area. For example, the climax scenes- the battle for Zion and Neo's ""inevitable"" fight with Smith- didn't have anything that had me, well, compelled. Much like the characters, the scenes with the CGI effects and digital animation have become less involving as a film and more involving if it was a video game. It's not to undermine the painstaking work it must've been must've been on films like the original Star Wars trilogy where practically everything had to be built from scratch instead of on a hard-drive), but the whole feeling behind it seemed strained.<br/><br/>Now, I understand that the first two installments weren't exactly flowing with eloquent dialog and in-depth characters, but at least in those the writer/directors and actors made an effort to keep it slightly above the satisfactory level for the genre. In Revolutions, the words spoken and acting felt wooden, stale, and perhaps far over-used. For example, there is a character that is introduced into the film midway through who is a sixteen year-old wanting to fight against the machines despite his age being too young. Unless you've never seen a sci-fi action film, or are too dense to know where this character fits in a film like this, it's a given to the audience how important this ""minor"" character will be in that battle for Zion. And, indeed there were a couple of scenes towards the end where I felt like the filmmakers were treating me like a complete idiot. That the acting is reminiscent of a bad series or movie-of-the-week on the sci-fi channel doesn't help things (even Smith is a little un-Smith like at times). True, fans of these movies and of the genre don't go to these movies for great and original conversing and acting ability, but, come on...<br/><br/>All that being said, when I left Revolutions, I didn't feel as if I had left seeing a failure. There were certain things; scenes that I saw and felt that were OK. As mentioned earlier, the story that unfolded in this one made more sense this time around that in the Reloaded, where some points in the story were kept elusive. Even the character of Bane (Ian Bliss), who is apart of the cliché wheel, was a nice touch to the proceedings. Maybe The Matrix Revolutions is, from my perspective, just another one of the final installments in trilogy history that remain the drop-off from the last two (The Godfather trilogy and the Living-Dead trilogy come to mind). In all, this trilogy is a noteworthy one in film history, certainly in its genre, and I was glad I saw it. Yet, it was a disappointment in more ways than it should've been. Grade: C"

"padiyark","2","1","1","6 November 2003"," A traitor to the spirit of the original Matrix
","WARNING:  POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>When a movie is made in sequels, especially with a purpose of an ending, one expects some kind of closure in the motif of the original.  The first Star Wars triad had this, as does the Godfather series.  The Matrix series, though, has abandoned the feel of the original and seems to have wandered off babbling to the end, not knowing what it was.<br/><br/>The original Matrix was a classic; a thinking man's ""TRON"".  Not only did it have a good story with an interesting philosophy, but the action was original and the balance on all aspects of film making was equal.  Matrix Reloaded seemed to try to tip the balance towards the action side, with a decline in acting and story, and more of an emphasis on action and special effects.  The big promise in this film, though, was that we would understand more about the matrix itself and the origins and powers of ""The One"".<br/><br/>Matrix Revolutions, with everything above taken into account, is an utter failure.  It abandons almost everything that made the original great and starts rambling along.  While many will argue that it's more about the philosophy, I found that aspect lacking.  On a movie on its own, I would have hated this film for its lack of originality; as part of a series, it is an utter failure.<br/><br/>(Here are the spoilers, so beware)<br/><br/>Let's start talking about Neo's special powers at the end of Reloaded.  We are never given an adequate explanation on how he got them other than that ""the powers of the one extend beyond the matrix"".  The reloaded Smith, while taking over the matrix, seems to have no effect on the machines atttacking Zion.  Morpheus, who had a big role in the last two films, seems to be on the backburner in this film; instead, all the small characters who were really not important in the second film get more screen time without any true development.  The frenchman and his woman, who seemed so ominous in the second film, are just a whimper in this film.  Death scenes of major and minor characters are treated more like the Gipper death speech, extending beyond the natural lifespan of a human being.  We never truly understand how Neo defeats Smith--it's more like a quick ending to finish it all once and for all.  Even the peace between machine and humans thing was never adequately explained or followed.  Finally, scenes from Star Wars, Aliens, the Wizard of Oz, and  even the original Matrix have been rehashed, destroying the originality that made the first Matrix so great.<br/><br/>Worst of all was the the complete disregard for good action scenes.  In Reloaded, we at least had a great highway sequence, and an excellent lobby sequence, and a decent alley sequence.  Here, the action scenes last at the most one minute, are totally unoriginal, and pure trash.  Even the promising fight between Smith and Neo becomes a cliched ""war of the gods"", with both flying around, bouncing into each other and just hitting each other.  No cool martial arts, no nothing.  What a pity.<br/><br/>You, like me, might go to see the movie for closure.  I really cannot recommend this film even for closure.  After coming out of the theatre, I felt cheated and decieved by Matrix Reloaded.  Sometimes, it is best just to leave the original be and let it be remembered as a classic on its own rather than trying to rehash it again just for profits."
"fsgambuz","2","1","1","6 November 2003"," an end coming way, way too late
","A terrible, jumbled mess of an ending to what has now become a very flawed trilogy. No redeeming quality whatsoever in this boring flick... if you expect to be actually told something about the nature of the One, or the prophecy, or the Merovingian, or the Architect, the Oracle or anything else, well, you going to be totally disappointed. After two long (VERY long) hours of pointless soap opera dialogue interspersed by some of the most futile, boring and ill-conceived battles ever seen on a screen, the poor sap watching at the screen is left clutching at straws and with the horrible omen of another episode and a whole barrage of comic-books, novelizations, videogames, etc. looming on the horizon. I really think the Directors should watch Kill Bill and their driveling couple back to back... they could probably learn a thing or two about action scenes and dialogues. A sorry ending to a bad trilogy. The first movie was really excellent, but the other two... keep away if you still can."
"The Davii","5","1","1","6 November 2003"," Visually interesting, but poor closure to the trilogy
","This film suffers greatly from the mythos and world that it created in the first two films.<br/><br/>*** Spoilers below ***<br/><br/>Just as the recent ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is tame compared to ""Kill Bill"" (which was so over the top, it became a Road Runner cartoon). Matrix Reloaded gave us the 100-Smith ""Burly Brawl,"" and the half-hour chase. Matrix Revolutions provides ""more, more, more"" of action with sentinels, ships, gunfire, and everything that (in still panel form) would make a comic book exciting.<br/><br/>Characters introduced in the earlier films have diminished roles (Persephone, The Architect, the ""Frenchman"", and even Morpheus and Trinity are given little to do) and some minor characters are given pivotal roles (the 16-year old kid, drawing a page from Wesley Crusher by saving the day, oh, wait, no he doesn't. Psych!).<br/><br/>We have set-ups (the M. C. Escher-styled train station) without payoffs (sure, the gang has to solve the puzzle, but... so what? Does it matter later? Does it advance the plot? Does it in any way affect the ending?).<br/><br/>
While ""Matrix Reloaded"" suffered from ""Empire Strikes Back"" syndrome, ""Matrix Revolutions"" suffers from ""Attack of the Clones"" syndrome, with so many things happening on-screen that ""more"" becomes irrelevant. If we see 10,000 sentinels, are we in 10x the amount of danger compared to 1,000 sentinels? The first film had small clusters (10?)! I think we've finally hit the asymptote on the amount of ""action"" that can happen onscreen. While the battles are ""epic"" in scale, the filmmakers do incorporate the struggles of some minor battle teams, something akin to the old WWII film ""The Longest Day"".<br/><br/>I won't even address some my disbelief that I could no longer suspend, like the huge mechanical beasts firing so much weaponry at the incoming machine sentinels while they not only aren't wearing hearing protection, but they *shout* commands to each other (standing side by side) or listen to commands from a speaker in what looks like a radio. With so much firepower expressed in that tiny area, it should have been full of smoke, noise, and confusion. (But then we couldn't see anything, saving them millions! in the process).<br/><br/>The Architect's mumbo-jumbo (from Matrix Reloaded) about how this Matrix wasn't the first iteration, but the sixth, was mostly ignored. Why? Why have a set up like that with no payoff? Why the Christian symbolism in The Matrix that was marginalized in the last two films?<br/><br/>In the end, though, it comes down to Smith asking why Neo continues to fight when ""he can't win"" (since he has survived as long as he has, it hardly appears to be an even battle, so is Smith trying to) and Neo responds with (spoiler!) ""Because I choose to"" (apparently arguing that ""free will"" is what separates him from the machines?). Choice is what ""The Matrix"" started with (blue vs. red pill). We're back to *choice*? That is the end philosophy of three films?! The Matrix has gone from uber-cool to cypher in just three films.<br/><br/>Art direction: 10/10 (ala ""Kill Bill"")<br/><br/>Plot         :  3/10 (ala ""Attack of the Clones"")<br/><br/>Overall      :  5/10 (can neither recommend seeing or avoiding)"
"arcello","2","1","1","6 November 2003"," Please don't bother.
","I've just caught the first local screening of this film, and I'm sorry to say the news is bad.<br/><br/>I've seen quite a few saggy, tired blockbusters this year and to be fair this film doesn't share the faults most of them have in common - the technical people have obviously put a lot of time and energy into this film, the production department have really carried things off (the sets are great) and there's no point where the effects overextend themselves.  It looks just fine.<br/><br/>The main problem - and this is huge - is with the story itself.  This film has none of the intriguing ideas of the first film, or even the half-baked ideas of the second.  It simply exists to pay off the cliff-hanger established in Reloaded, nothing else, and it does so very poorly.<br/><br/>If you found the love story aspects of the previous film overworked and dull, this film will simultaneously bore and nauseate you (and don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good love story).  The action is even dull, except as one reviewer has pointed out the scene in the dock, which will perk you up for all of five minutes.  Otherwise nothing you'll see here will compare with anything from the previous two films.<br/><br/>The actors seem to realise there's no rescuing the film, and it's kind of painful to watch Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne Moss (who carried the first film on their shoulders) looking sleepy and simply reciting their lines.  I can't blame them, they're terrible lines.  Hugo Weaving rants and raves and at least earns his paycheck.<br/><br/>And worst of all the end just falls apart.  Very little is resolved or explained, it basically sort of finishes.  The lights come up and the audience can finally go home.  You should have seen the audience I was with tonight - not a single happy face walking out of the theatre, the movie just died in front of our eyes.<br/><br/>I have a feeling half the world will see this film out of a sense of obligation to the first movie.  This kind of depresses me.  Your money would be better spent on pretty much anything else.<br/><br/>I generally like the Wachowski Brothers and wish them better luck next time."

","In a future where they have robot battle Armour, how has the concept of the recoilless rifle totally escaped them? The machine guns mounted on the battle armour would be totally useless as it would be impossible to aim any weapon with that much recoil. Plus it looked really dumb.<br/><br/>This movie is a total mess. There is no drama, no subtlety, nothing inventive or original. (who hasn't seen the mass of robot armies fighting each other in every video game trailer and rock video over the past few years?) The movie only gets interesting whenever Smith walks on, but he is so much more interesting than anything else going on that its distracting more than entertaining.<br/><br/>And is it me or was it impossible to follow what was going on? There was so much going on in the battle scenes and there was so much fast camera movement that it was completely impossible to focus on anything, much less tell what was happening. I occasionally had a vague notion that a 'squid' had been shot and was exploding, but I was not able to clearly seen any of the action, at all. Compare this to a great movie like Empire Strikes Back where there is a lot going on in the asteroid chase scene, but at no point do you question whether that was in fact a Tie Fighter hitting an asteroid, or if the Millennium Falcon was flying around in an asteroid field. Its all completely clear, and not so mind numbingly fast that you cannot begin to digest what you have seen.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is just awful, I cannot think of any reason I would ever watch this movie again."

","I enjoyed the first Matrix movie. It had a few characters, the plot was not all that complicated, and it was based on a very cool concept (humans traped into a virtual reality program). It was an action movie that made you think about life and its meaning.<br/><br/>On Matrix Reloaded, it got complicated. A lot of characters. Zion. Meetings between characters I didn't know the name. Programs and more programs (Keymaker, Merovingian). Smith got loose, somehow. Complicated and obscure plot. The Architect (what the...). BUT... it was a great action movie. For me, the amazing action scenes compensated the confusing, obscure plot.<br/><br/>I saw Matrix Revolutions yesterday. Well, how can I say it... It sucked. The plot is even more obscure. Every questions from Reloaded kept unanswered (like Persephone's kiss). The action sequences were clichéd, and boring. Even the fight between Neo and Smith (which was supposed to be the final combat between good and evil, the most amazing fight in all 3 movies) wasn't so good at all, it felt like a bad, bad, bad DragonBall episode. All in all, it was... disappointing. Just disappointing. No genius plot twist. No amazing action sequence. The characters were flat, the dialog was terrible (sometimes I felt Keanu was reading from cue cards, and I felt like Fishburne appeared in about 10 minutes in the whole movie).<br/><br/>Will the Wachowski brothers ever release any good (and by good, I mean profitable) movies ever? Will they ever recover from the Matrix? will they ever give an interview again? I belive not."

","This film is an absolute travesty.  It betrays the other pictures and makes a mockery of the entire franchise.  Part of the charm of the Matrix, was seeing extraordinary things happening in regular places.  People having kung fu fights on top of buildings, a showdown in a subway station, a shootout in a lobby, etc.  These kind of scenes were great, because the audience could connect with them, and the viewer almost felt like another world existed inside of their own.  This movie abandons that magic, choosing the force-feed the viewer with shot after shot of the `real world' (which I wasn't particularly crazy about in the first place), which looks less and less impressive every time you see it (the newer Star Wars movies, anyone?). All of the interesting characters from Reloaded are gone or forced into the background, including a certain Frenchman and his gorgeous wife.  The death scenes are corny and forced (with god-awful speeches to match), Hugo Weaving is given some positively rotten lines and the ending is abrupt and ill-conceived.  The philosophical dialog (which we all hoped would lead to some greater purpose or idea) is completely lost and the religious symbolism is overbearing and shallow.  Furthermore, Neo has ceased to be a human being the audience can relate with and is now cold and uninteresting to watch. The bottom line on this film is that is was under thought and over funded. It shows a lack of control in all regards.  To top it all off, some of the visual effects are particularly hideous, hindering this waste of celluloid even further.  My only hope is that the first film will survive this terrible ending and perhaps be viewed as a stand-alone movie, and not part of a trilogy (which it really isn't, although I thought that Reloaded setup the franchise for a great finish, but I guess I was wrong).  I was sorely disappointed...."

That movie had long unending fights and went on interminably to finally add some spice with the whole architect thing. All you sceptics thought it sucked until most of you started blabbing your mouths off about ""matrix within the matrix""... you made up that stuff yourselves and I don't know who started it, but you all bit and started fighting that line when it was clear that that wasn't so from the first time I saw the movie.<br/><br/>I was gripped during the entire movie (save the end) and came out with a tense neck from the action. My girlfriend (who doesn't like action and war movies) liked this installment, and she hasn't seen the 1st one all the way thru and hasn't seen reloaded either. I'd dare say that this movie might have gotten much MUCH better critique than it's getting here if it had been a movie unto it's own, or if all 3 had been in the same tone, maybe like The Lord of the Rings although it comes off more like star wars. On it's own it's a good movie with amazing and 100% believeable SFX, in the context of the other 2, it's a departure and that I believe made all the matrix fans mad, but the wachowskis hit the nail on the head with a fitting if somewhat annoying ending.<br/><br/>don't pay attention to the naysayers, this movie is worth watching and spending the 8 bucks to see it in a theater.

","*WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br/><br/>When I first began watching this film the first thing I noticed was that the oracle had either gone on a diet or was a completely different actress. I guess the lady who was in the first 2 films died in late 2001, and never got a chance to appear in Revolutions. When I was watching I was thinking that maybe they changed her for some deep reason, that I'd eventually find out about later. She even asks Neo at one point if she looks different to him.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I soon found out this wasn't going to happen, for 2 reasons, one of which I didn't know yet, being that the actress was dead, and the other being that this film isn't deep at all! It really wants to be and it trys so hard, but really just ends up being kinda cheesy. I kept waiting for something to happen. All I really got were some cool action scenes and some state of the art CGI. There seems to be quite a few one liners, and allot of the film is just recycled from the previous 2 films.<br/><br/>Really the movie just feels like an extension of Reloaded. It never really begins it just kind of continues. I did enjoy some the apocaliptic stuff. It kinda reminded me of that Anime Neon Genesis Evangelion, but overall it's kind of a let down.

","This movie is a phenomenal piece of trash.  There is no story line, no characters (at least none that is played with any convincing emotional expression), and excrutiatingly long battle sequences.  And the ending is not just confusing, it is outright ridiculous.  The 45 minute or so long battle of the robots and the sentinels is so tedious and unpleasant that I found myself counting the ceiling tiles in the theater.  While the first Matrix was an awesome display of visual magic delivered with conviction and artistic beauty, this visual effects of this film have no bearing on the story line.  Instead of elevating the innate conflict of man/machine and good/evil with special effects that build up to a crescendo in keeping with the evolving story line and the unfolding of the mysteries, the action sequences in this movie emerge as stupid and misplaced.  Why, for example, are New and Agent Smith, who by now have mastered the workings of the Matrix and can interact in the realm of energy fields have to fight each other with Jiu Jitsu skills?  They could, by now, just blow the other with sparks of energy bombs now that it is clear to both of them that the physical body exists only in the virtual matrix world. The ending is so ridiculous that it is embarassing.  The boss of the machines appears with a human-like face to talk peace with Neo.  soon after, the Architect appears with the Oracle as representing the rationsl and the spontaneous.  And then the multicolored sunset apears in the presumably emancipated matrix when the sun has supposedly been extinct for centuries. As I left the theater, I felt a strong urge to warn fellow theater goers to spare their time and money.  Maybe one good thing this trash of a movie produced was my sense of philanthropy.

The first movie was a trend setter, it inspired an entire new filming technique as is a classic in it's genre. I actually thought Reloaded was clever, at least it provoked thought and discussion. I can't think what kind of discussion Revolutions will provoke apart from discussions of disappointment. It is poorly scripted, lamely acted, and generally substandard.

And like i can't wait for matrix four cos like the war's only a truce and neo isn't dead (maybe) so like he could come back and do kung foo and smith could come back again, it would so awesome, he could fight like 100000000000000000 agent smiths at once!<br/><br/>I'm sorry, this film has actually lowered my IQ significantly, only time will tell if this is permanent, in short a turgid piece of cinema. It also steals all its good ideas from early Brian De Palma films, Brian first came up with the idea of silly clothing, unrealistic dialogue and sexy dancing being watched through a telescope from across the valley"
"Dr. Nick Riviera","Null","1","1","5 November 2003"," missed opportunity
","I expected so much from this movie and got so little. I may be in something of a minority here but I loved Reloaded, maybe even more than the original. The complex exploration of the nature of the Matrix in that film widened the scope of the story arc into new territory, seemingly opening up a plethora of possible revelations to be revealed in 'Revolutions'. Disappointingly, the makers completely abandoned this approach in favour of what boils down to an almighty scrap. Granted, the film does resolve the question of Neo's 'purpose' in the Matrix and beyond, but virtually all the other tantalizing plot threads from the previous two films have been left hanging. Instead we get a story which essentially focuses only on the 'battle for Zion', and some extremely heavy-handed religious symbolism. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy films to leave endings open, but there's a difference between leaving the audience guessing and blatantly abandoning or losing plot threads. To me that just smacks of either poor plotting or, more likely, a way to get more cash from us. The previous two films were intelligent and thought-provoking, but the Wachowskis seem to have missed the enormous potential this story had, and have ended up with little more than a big, dumb action movie with a ridiculously simple 'conclusion'."

","The excitement was big. Had been waiting for this for a long time, though didn't quite know what to expect, because already in the sequel, there was something that wasn't the same. The sequel did not have the same brilliance as the first film, but was still quite amazing to see through its heavy action-packed fight scenes. Well, anyway, this was kind of also what I was expecting from the last part of the trilogy, but no. The film I saw wasn't The Matrix - it was something that had been turned into a big mixture of love-scenes and and complicated explanations of what plot they had messed up in the sequel.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say I didn't enjoy those two hours and ten minutes, because I did, but I didn't leave the cinema with quite same feeling as I did when having seen one of the two previous films. The brilliance of The Matrix has certainly been lost in this last episode (if not already in the sequel).<br/><br/>And also: Where the f**k was RATM??!!<br/><br/> My rating: 3/10."

","This was a complete cinematic travesty. I'm hoping this is an elaborate joke by the W. Brothers, and they'll release the REAL conclusion next week or something.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>First, the beginning is completely nonsensical. I wasn't a big fan of Reloaded, but I liked the Architect scene, and the ending cliffhanger. THe cliffhanger is resolved in about ten seconds with all the drama and mystery of an episode of Scooby-Doo, and as far as I can tell, none of the characters even remember the Architect, as everyone proceeds along their current path as if it never happened.<br/><br/>The Battle for Zion scenes were OK. I thought the 10-second sidestory with the teenager kissing Neo's ass in Reloaded (his name slips my mind, as I'm sure it has yours) and LInk's girlfriend wasn't really necessary and detracts from the plot, simply removing the focus from the main story arc.<br/><br/>All the ""causality"" and ""choice"" focus from the second one is gone, with only a few references that don't make much sense in context. None of the loose ends from reloaded are really satisfactorily resolved.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what Morpheus is doing in this movie. It would actually have been a bit better if he had been Smith-cloned at the end of the second one, as he has no real part in this one. None. I'm not even sure if they wrote any dialogue for him, or just told him to hang around the set until the end credits and let him improv the dialogue.<br/><br/>The final fight was pretty cool, action-wise. The dialogue was silly and the resolution of the conflict even sillier.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending made me want to throw up. I'm not going into further detail, simply because I feel nauseous just thinking about it.<br/><br/>Everyone's going to see this movie, simply because it's the final Matrix movie. But trust me, you'll be much happier if you just pretend it never came out and let your imagination finish the story for you."
"apchuk","2","1","1","5 November 2003"," Pretentious
","Where we had inspiration in the 1st Matrix, we see only shameless commercial enterprise by Wachowski Brothers, Mr. Keanu Reeves & Co.  No doubt they did their best to produce something decent. All the crew tried very hard. But the brothers seem to have had no direction at all - only a desire to hit a big time until it is not too late. Thus we have huge plot holes and meaningless pretentious dialogues just to tie one beautifully shot action sequence to another. And please don't say anything about deep ""philosophical"" meaning! During Moscow premiere of the movie audience laughed just at the moments supposed to be touching or meaningful. It was simply because those people have what Wachowskis lack - common sense, sense of humor and self- irony."
"teddeman","2","1","1","5 November 2003"," The Matrix Trilogy - Andy and Larry's Not So Excellent Adventure
","The Matrix Trilogy - Andy and Larry's Not So Excellent Adventure<br/><br/> Initially I left the Maryland premiere of Matrix Revolutions felling happy. After all I was one of the first viewers to find out where the Matrix Reloaded's lame cliffhanger was going.  I saw the film in one of the best theaters on the east coast, The Senator.  I saw an action sequence that equaled the motorcycle chase in the previous film.  Heck there were even numerous players from the Baltimore Ravens in the theater with me. Everything was great until the film's bitter aftertaste hit my pallet.<br/><br/> A friend asked me, `When you review a film do you hold it up to previous films for comparison?'  Of course I do.  It is extremely rare for a film to redefine or reinvent a genre.  The first Matrix did.  Pulling off a successful movie trilogy is a tricky endeavor.  Looking to the past one finds a great deal of good and bad movie trilogies.  Some are destined to be great but many, like the Matrix franchise, aren't so fortunate.<br/><br/> Star Wars episodes 4-6 are timeless because limitations in film technology forced the actors and screenplay to carry the film.  There is genuine chemistry between characters that allows you to care about what happens to them.  There is no over-dependence on CGI and bloated action sequences to make up for a weak story.<br/><br/> That is not to say that CGI is a bad thing.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy evolved from a time tested set of successful novels.  The use of CGI in the series adds to the enjoyment of an already proven story.  The success of the trilogy is again based on strong screenwriting and powerful acting.  This is not the case in the Matrix trilogy.<br/><br/> Other trilogies start off strong and continue to amaze only to implode during their final installments.  The Alien, Lethal Weapon, and Die Hard films are prime examples of two hit wonders.  These series stormed onto the scene with unique approaches to old formulas.  The films then investigate dynamics left unexplored in the first films and should have stopped there.<br/><br/>Instead the final installments of these series became laughable parodies of their predecessors.  (Some would say the Terminator films fall into this category; refer to my T3 review to see why they don't).  Sadly, these are not examples of the Matrix trilogy either.<br/><br/> Some series are hit or miss as they trudge along.  Look to Indiana Jones, Axel Foley, Rocky and Rambo for proof.  These films had a formula that was replayed multiple times with varying degrees of success.  Sometimes it worked sometimes it didn't.  Often the socio-political climate that made one film work had changed causing subsequent films to fail.  What were they thinking when they made Temple of Doom anyway?<br/><br/> So what is the Matrix's place in the trilogy landscape?  There is yet another trilogy class that unfortunately dominates the movie industry.  Some films explode on the scene and wrap their story up in a nice neat little package.  Unmercifully they return to cash in on their predecessor's success.<br/><br/>The first series that comes to mind is the Back to the Future franchise. The first movie did what it needed to and did it well.  Then mimicking Sherman and Peabody in their time machine, Marty and the Doc return for more disastrous adventures.  Unlike the Peabody cartoons, which contained an interesting history lesson, 2nd and 3rd films were a horrible waste of film stock.  Coincidentally those 2nd and 3rd installments were also filmed concurrently.  My question to the Wachowski brothers is, `Hello, McFlys, did you see what followed Jaws?'  Finally we have found a category for the Matrix trilogy!<br/><br/> The first film was so new and different that viewers were able to see past the mediocre acting.  A smaller budget led to a conservative use of CGI and a heavier reliance on the story of, and the character's interaction with, the matrix.  It was a great concept on the same level as the `so if our universe is an atom on somebody's finger, there could be a tiny universe on my finger,' Pinto recites in Animal House.<br/><br/> The second and third films still have the same weak actors, but now also have weak plots to contend with.  Take away the motorcycle chase sequence from Reloaded and what are you really left with?  Take away the defending Zion sequence from Revolutions and what do you get?  You get a mediocre action film that..<br/><br/> *** Spoilers in the following paragraph ***<br/><br/> .. pauses just long enough for people to deliver trite dialog usually prior to dying.  Why didn't the sentinels stomp all over 'Kid' while he was listening to Mifune drone on and on?  How did all those sentinels miss killing Link's girlfriend?  What exactly is the machines motivation for killing the humans?  Why did Neo talking to the machine god remind me so much of the final stage of the Arkaniod arcade game?  Did we really need to see Trinity experience the sun?  Why did all those Smiths just stand around and watch?<br/><br/> *** End Spoilers ***<br/><br/> So many of the Matrix Revolutions scenes made me sicker to my stomach then the `There it is..Jurassic Park!' and the `Grandpa! Grandpa!' scenes in the 'epic' Jurassic Cheese Park.  The Wachowski brothers had a tough act to follow.  If they had brought in other writers they might have developed a better direction to take the Matrix franchise.  They didn't.  Their trilogy now sits along side the likes of Smokey and the Bandit, Jaws and Highlander leaving viewers wondering why didn't they leave well enough alone.<br/><br/> The Matrix is and will continue to hold a well-deserved place in the imdb.com top 50.  I doubt we will see its followers there or anywhere near the top 250.  Both Reloaded and Revolutions belong in the bottom 100, rotting away with the plethora of other failed sequels that rule that category.<br/><br/> ** (out of 5) The defending Zion sequence saved this from * (out of 5)."
"DUKEJBM","Null","1","1","5 November 2003"," Huge Misfire & Huge Disappointment
","Like Reloaded, Revolutions pretended to be smart and philosophical by over-dressing it with obscure references to ""choice"" and ""destiny"" (oh the clichés), but ultimately there was no thought put into the writing. Even the action scenes were on the weak and flimsy side. The entire movie lacked the energy of the original. Not only that, but there was zero chemistry between the stars--who have no personality or charisma, and there was no character development at all. Since the movie put way too much emphasis on the characters, this was a serious problem. The best thing they did was put a sock over Keanu's eyes for part of this movie.  At least we avoided seeing him try and act sad.  This film had some nice effects that quickly became boring as their setup and overuse flowed for far too long. This third installment rips off everyone from Daredevil to Jesus.  Their `savior' Neo... well it's obvious. We see blind Neo `see' using a strikingly similar shadow world concept. Daredevil anyone? Hmmmm.  Throw in some Millenium Falcon dog fight moments and a Superman 2 type fight and I just stopped paying attention. Very Original guys..."

Really, there isn't much else other than shooting up agents and other people. (which both of the other movies do much of).

"TimBoHannon","2","3","6","7 December 2007"," Destroys all that is left
","THIS COMMENT CONTAINS VERY HEAVY SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Anticipation was high entering May of 2003 when the first sequel to ""The Matrix"" was released. Writers/directors Andy and Larry Wachowski redefined reality in the first film, yet fell victim to the impulse to do it again. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" contained their shocking ending, but in doing so the Wachowskis altered their perfect vision beyond repair. That set the course for this film and all of its follies.<br/><br/>1. Lack of time in the Matrix: The title is a bait-and-switch. It is called the matrix yet almost no time is spent there. I count five brief scenes: Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) meeting with the Oracle (Mary Alice), the invasion of the Merovingian's (Lambert Wilson) night club, Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Smith (Hugo Weaving) seeing the Oracle, the final fight between Neo and Smith, and the end meeting of the Oracle and the Architect (Helmut Bukaitis).<br/><br/>2. No Agents: ""Every single man or woman who has stood their ground, everyone who has fought an Agent has died. I've seen an Agent punch through a concrete wall. Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air."" Morpheus, ""The Matrix."" <br/><br/>Back then, the Agents were scary. They are one of the primary reasons ""The Matrix"" succeeded so greatly. They were invincible. Wherever there were people, they could follow. I remember my jaw dropping when Agent Jones avoided Neo's gunfire, and when Smith delivered impossibly quick punches to Neo's stomach, and when Smith was run over by a subway car, only to emerge anew from it seconds later. Instead of them, we are given a single gun battle against the Merovingian's henchmen.<br/><br/>3. Zion's defenses: ""Electro-magnetic Pulseit's the only weapon we have against the machines.""-Trinity, ""The Matrix."" ""They can't know we don't have an EMP.""-Lock, ""The Matrix Revolutions."" Say what? Zion is the last human city and the center of human resistance. They do not even equip their entry point with an EMP while 250,000 sentinels are closing in? Wow, they are dumb.<br/><br/>4. The source of Neo's power: ""The power of the One extends beyond this world; it reaches from here all the way back to where it came from."" The Oracle. ""Where?"" Neo. ""The Source."" The Oracle, ""The Matrix Revolutions."" So the power of the one comes from the Source. Does he control the source? Does it control him? If that is so, why does the Source not revoke his power once he has refused his function? If he was working for the machines, why did the Agents fight him? <br/><br/>5. Virus Agent Smith: Star Trek survived without Khan. James Bond was just fine after Goldfinger. ""Batman Returns"" made a huge profit without the Joker. This series would have flourished without Smith as a cheap Borg rip-off. The whole idea makes the Matrix invalid.<br/><br/>6. The battle in the dock: Another sad example of writers contradicting what is established for the sake of an action scene they want. It is like Space Invaders; kill as many machines as you can before they overwhelm you. It is stupid and frustrating, only existing for the CGI. The main battle of the film should be in the Matrix, not out of it.<br/><br/>7. The Architect: ""That's his purpose, to balance the equation."" ""Smith is the result of the equation trying to balance itself."" The Oracle, ""The Matrix Revolutions."" <br/><br/>Does that mean that the Architect created Smith? Smith assimilates the entire Matrix. Could the Architect not see it? Why would he create a program that will destroy the Matrix, infect the Source, and then destroy the real world as well? These questions are raised but no answers are given. The plot becomes as mysterious as Wes Studi's character from ""Mystery Men"" when it should be providing answers.<br/><br/>8. The function of the One: ""The Agents are the gatekeepers. They are guarding all the doors; they are holding all the keys which means that sooner or later, someone is going to have to fight them."" Morpheus, ""The Matrix."" <br/><br/>Now we know how the war can be won. Instead of winning the war, Neo can only help by the providence of Smith's existence.<br/><br/>9. The Merovingian: Just what the hell is this guy's function? All he does is make random decisions. He even fights the Source by imprisoning the Keymaker. Then he holds Neo, the only person who can save him and everybody else.<br/><br/>10. Seraph's inconsistent power: The agents are helpless before Neo's power. The Seraph was able to hold his own against the One, then struggles with the Merovingian's inferior programs. If they were as good as the agents, they *would* be the agents, so Seraph should have no trouble.<br/><br/>11. The death of Trinity: If they were to kill Trinity, it should have been at the end of ""Reloaded."" When her life is saved, she becomes untouchable. Her salvation makes us root for her even more. I liked her from the beginning, and she grows more and more sympathetic as her love for Neo does. Killing her in an unheroic fashion kills the part of the trilogy's very soul.<br/><br/>12. The Ending: Everything in the first film pointed to the One winning the war, not dying for a truce with a wicked enemy. That is *the* main reason that ""The Matrix Revolutions"" was poorly received. Humanity only survives because of Smith's crusade. With their stupid decision regarding the ending of ""Reloaded,"" the Wachowskis painted themselves into a corner. After villains like Agent Smith and the precise ruthlessness of the machine army, we want to see victory, not treaty. Great lengths are taken to ensure we hate the machines. The ending is what broke ""Reloaded,"" and here it breaks the trilogy. The Wachowskis depriving the viewer of what they conditioned them to desire is unforgivable, Christ allegory or not."

","I saw the other two Matrix films and thought I should see the last one to see how the series ends. BIG MISTAKE! The Matrix Revolutions was a piece of garbage! 45 minutes of the movie was total filler, just a guy in a computer-generated suit screaming and shooting computer generated blurs that you couldn't even see clearly. And, I don't doubt for a second that this was all filler because the movie ended at EXACTLY 2 hours, 0 minutes, and 0 seconds, as if they made a movie that only lasted an hour and said ""Hmmm, we need to kill some time here, let's have a guy scream and pretend to shoot things, then we will add computer generated things later"" but then they ran out of money for the computer generated aliens and so just made them a big blur.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves, who can't act, is hardly even in this one. It's like they made the movie without him. I was hoping so much to learn about him, what made Neo so special, how he would defeat the Matrix, etc. Without spoiling anything, let's just say VERY DISAPPOINTING! He just sort of magically had the ability to do anything he wanted. THEN WHY DID IT TAKE THREE MOVIES FOR HIM TO FINISH THE JOB WHEN HE COULD HAVE JUST DONE IT AT ANY TIME HE WANTED??? No plot resolution whatsoever.<br/><br/>The first Matrix was BRILLIANT. The philosophy of the Matrix was deep and meaningful. All the way back to Descartes and ""how to we know we exist?"" but then the last one was nothing but a cheap cop out. I truly believed that the makers of this film knew everyone would go see the last one, no matter how bad they made it, how many corners they cut, or how crappy the resolution of the plot was. And, like a sucker, I did see it. I wanted to see how the series ended. And that was a big mistake. This was a complete waste of time.

In fact there is not one thing that is believable ...maybe that appeals to adolescents, but to anyone who has seriously thought about the future, one would hope they would have developed more imaginative weapons, better speaking skills, better ability to emote and lead lives that have more meaning.

"dgeer80","9","3","6","27 October 2004"," A very good conclusion to an amazing trilogy of films
","OK, let me first say that the first ""Matrix"" film is a crowning achievement. It stands on its own, and can appeal to most mainstream audiences. Most anyone can understand the plot. <br/><br/>But with ""Reloaded"" and especially ""Revolutions,"" even the most hardcore sci-fi fans who usually get these kinds of films walked out of the last two scratching their heads. When walking out of ""Reloaded,"" they assumed that they'd get clearer answers in ""Revolutions,"" so most people cut ""Reloaded"" some slack (even though it's just as convoluted as ""Revolutions""). This is why ""Revolutions"" is the most maligned Matrix film. The plots of the sequels was just too convoluted for mainstream audiences, and ""Revolutions"" didn't offer the clear explanations audiences were looking for.<br/><br/>They couldn't figure out why Neo had power outside the Matrix. Why could he stop Sentinels by thinking it? Why could he still see after being blinded by Bane, and see in a different way for that matter? The first film established how to get power within the Matrix, but that outside of the Matrix he was just another ordinary, but machine-engineered human being. So what was all this about?<br/><br/>Why was Bane also Smith? How could Smith be in the real world in someone's body?<br/><br/>How did Neo separate his mind from his body and end up at the Train Station place? What IS the Train Station?<br/><br/>What was the deal with the family of programs at the Train Station who were smuggling their daughter out? What specifically was Sati all about? They sort of make a big deal of her, especially at the end.<br/><br/>Why did the Oracle's appearance change (aside from the original actress dying before the third film was made)?<br/><br/>How exactly was Smith destroyed in the end? How exactly was peace made between the Machines and Man? Why not just have a plot where they destroy the Matrix?<br/><br/>What was the Merovingian (the French Man) all about? What was his purpose?<br/><br/>What was Seraph all about?<br/><br/>Zion was destroyed 5 times before without the Zion peoples' knowledge? How is that possible? Why did it occur? How and why were there 5 ""Ones"" before Neo?<br/><br/>Getting the answers to these questions is imperative to enjoying the plot. And yet, the answers are very, very vague in the film. So because of that, most people just thought that the Wachowski Brothers copped out and made a special effects film that's all style and no substance.<br/><br/>But the answers are there, and if one thinks about it, the film makes perfect sense. They just don't shove it all in your face like we're used to seeing with most films. So if one can actually grasp what the directors were trying to convey in the plot, for me anyway, becomes a much more enjoyable piece of cinema. <br/><br/>I won't go into answering all the questions above, but if you check out www.thematrix101.com , you'll find mostly what is needed to enjoy the plot.<br/><br/>Get over your first impression of the film if it was negative and check out that website for some answers. Perhaps if you understand the film, you might like it after all."

","Even the first Matrix movie was a disappointment for me, because i was being told by everyone and his aunt that (besides having very original fighting scenes) this is something unheard of in Sci Fi, such hyper-original story involving virtual reality and something that really makes you think. I went to cinema happily expecting a subtle interplay of virtual and ""real"" reality, finally a SF film worthy of best SF literature, only to find out that it's about stupid evil robots eating people (or whatever). Where i expected wit and originality, subtleness and philosophy, i found Hollywood clichés, really not so different from Alien type of movie, as everyone thinks it to be. But i'll grant them (Matrix fans) that at least in the world of SF _cinema_, Matrix did scratch a surface - but no more - of something interesting, which can't be said for 99% of other SF movies.<br/><br/>As for Matrix Revolutions, i really thought i'll die of boredom. The forced pump-up to the siege of Zion was so shallow i was almost congratulating myself on seeing through the hype (and into nothingness) already in the first movie. These guys obviously don't have anything to say apart from hitherto unseen camera-angles and shooting speeds. I saw the film on DVD, and while i barely survived through the film itself, i enjoyed the second disk, which is all about how they made it, immensely. I really do appreciate all the effort put into special effects. It is all ground breaking, no doubt. But absent this insight into all the intricacies of virtual humans, computer graphics and miniature models, while you watch the movie it just boils down to ""yeah, nice effects, but...""<br/><br/>My point being that SFX is NOT ENOUGH to make a good movie. And virtually everything else in this movie S U C K S. Acting? There is no. Characters? They're all carton cutouts 1 milimeter thick ans seen a zillion times. Story? Who can honestly say they got it? If it's about ""fight for what you believe in and believe in love"", as some here say, i think it takes some finesse if you want to make the message work - it's not enough that a character in the film says those words. In these fascinating ""the-making-of"" documentaries, most people were talking about what they did and how they did it. But occasionally, some would find it appropriate to talk about ""deep philosophy"" that this movie carries.<br/><br/>The effects were great, but philosophy - please spare me."

","I really enjoyed M3 even though it was less action and more dramatic than its predecessors.  For the record, I thought M2 sucked - it was all action and nonsense.  SPOILER ALERT:   M3 was going well until Neo got to the mechanical city.  There were a number of places near the end where I wondered why certain things were done...like why everyone hovered around the pilot and then had to run to their weapons when they were detected trying to sneak home.  Also, the Oracle said she didn't tell Neo certain things because 'he' (Neo's alter ego by another name) didn't think he was ready to know.  Of course it would have been a much shorter movie had everyone been logical.   I still don't know who that ""baby thing"" (as someone else called it) was supposed to be - King of the machines I guess.  Or how/why that child ended up spending so much time with the Oracle.  And that final fight was stupid - just felt over done.  After a few blows with no apparent results, you would think an intelligent being would try another option besides throwing the same punch or kick that was ineffective earlier.  But after suffering thru Kill Bill Vol 2, I still give this 7 out of 10."

This movie offers even less in plot than Reloaded, so tons of stuff is left unresolved.  That doesn't really matter though because by the end you really won't care.

"Michael Kenmore","9","3","6","27 January 2004"," The best of the Matrix movies
","Say what you want about the third film, I came in with a rock-bottom low expectation due to overwhelmingly negative word of mouth and reviews. Like the second movie, I waited three months before going to see the over-hyped film with the low expectation in mind. I emerged stunned, amazed and energized. Five years ago I panned the first film because it was basically a rip-off of the Mamoru Oshii masterpiece Ghost in the Shell with the dash of Biblical allegories and pseudo-babble philosophy 101. I still hold that opinion.<br/><br/>What the Wachowski brothers have achieved is wholly unprecedented to the point of astonishment, even rivaling Peter Jackson's adaptation of Return of the King. The third Matrix film concludes in the most unexpected way in the direction it took from the first film to the middle to the final. This film is meant to conclude in the most obvious (or subtle) way that defies the conventional expectation of virtually every Matrix fan and average moviegoer.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions may be about the ultimate man versus machine showdown, which is probably the reason why Matrix fans went in to see it in the hope that action and storyline remain identical to the first film and rectify the loose ends in the second film, but it's well-laid out to the stunning twists and the very ending that leaves the questions unanswered for the audiences to interpret for themselves. I know Wachowski Brothers are no Kubrick, but they paid homage to intellectual criticism posed to the audiences. The majority of the audiences chose to reject it while I embrace the Wachowski brothers' vision.<br/><br/>In summary, the majority of the Matrix fanbase and average moviegoing public (in any part of the world) are ignorant and oblivious idiots for refusing to yield to open-minded interpretation in the art form of cinema and chose the easy route of denigrating the film and its filmmakers without backing up their arguments in the coherent logic of what the Matrix is truly about. In retrospect, the first two Matrix films are part of the Philip K. Dick fictional universe leading to the inevitable albeit intellectually and psychologically profound treatise on human nature and artificial intelligence technology in the third film.<br/><br/>Larry and Andy - if you read this comment, forgive me for not being favorable to your first film, but you did an amazing job. Don't let them get you down. I pray Ghost in the Shell: Innocence will be a mindbending experience similar to A.I. and The Matrix Revolutions.<br/><br/>
**** out of four stars"
"TVTorgo","9","3","6","22 November 2003"," Maybe you just have to ""get it""
","There are lots of negative reviews of this movie, yet at the time of this writing, it is running a 6.4/10 in the voting section, so clearly there are those who like it. Count me as one of them, despite going in with full knowledge of the beating this film was taking in the opinion arena.<br/><br/>
To preface, let me say that I loved Matrix, and disliked Matrix II.  Too much enigma-speak, too many unanswered questions, to much raver partying. To be fair, Matrix II suffers from 'tween syndrome, having to act as a bridge between the first and third movies.<br/><br/>People say that Matrix Revolutions fails to answer the questions and mysteries raised in Reloaded, which is true to a certain extent. But some of these questions are answered and others are revisited but still remain unanswered. That's the way things are sometimes, folks! Sometimes you have to try to formulate your own interpretation of what you see. Some people, when not spoon-fed the ""answers"", become irate, and claim that the filmmakers were lazy or that the reason they can't figure things out is that there is nothing to understand. Wrong! This movie clearly has as much symbolism and as many references to classical literature and mythology as the first movie. It's up to the viewer to look for it.<br/><br/>
Granted, this movie is harder to follow than Matrix I. If your grasp of the storyline jumps the tracks before the end, the whole film may come across as a jumble of unconnected action sequences and empty mysticism. But if you ""get"" what's happening, you will see how things have consistently developed through the 3 movies and how the ending of Revolutions really could not have happened any other way. It's not about Zion, it's not about the Oracle, it's not about Trinity or Morpheus or any or any of the other humans. It's about Neo and Smith, not representing good and evil, but life and anti-life. In that situation, even the machines choose life.<br/><br/>Is everything perfect? No. I wholeheartedly agree that the suspension of disbelief gets strained at times, particularly in regards to the lack of EMP devices at Zion and the curious behavior of the sentinels during the battle scenes. But compared to the real story of Neo and Smith, the actions scenes were just there to fill in the time.<br/><br/>In summary, I found this installment to be a cohesive, well-crafted conclusion to the trilogy. Go into it expecting to apply a little brain power, because no one is going to hold your hand and explain it all at the end. But there are enough of us who ""get it"" to assure everyone that there are rational interpretations to what you see. We may not agree on what ""it"" is, but that sometimes happens with art."
"Bumpyknucklez","7","3","6","11 November 2003"," it was ok.
","The movie was ok. At best. Probably my least favorite of the trilogy. Nothing that just had me outta my seat. No reason to see it again. It was O.K. That's it. It wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't great either."
"lance-stewart","10","3","6","10 November 2003"," Truly great, but wrongfully unappreciated film.
","What a great movie!  I went to it hearing nothing but bad comments.  But I realized after the second movie came out that everyone has different expectations for the series.  Some just want eye-candy (I'm referring to the FX), others want a simple storybook tale acted out, others couldn't care less what it looks like and want a compelling, intriguing or challenging story line.<br/><br/>What you expect will determine what you think of the film.<br/><br/>For those who want to see a special effects movie with a shallow easy-to-swallow story line, they will hate it.  For those who, like me, were captured by the sheer inventiveness of the story and its layers-of-significance presentation style, they will find it amazing. This can be enjoyed on so many levels.  It's got everything from being great looking/sounding movie to an interpretive and highly symbolic story. I've never read Dante's Inferno, but after watching this, I think I'm going to have to.<br/><br/>This movie will not explicitly tell all the ""why""s or ""how""s you may have about the Matrix story.  Many things are left to be interpreted by the viewer.  But clues are always given to generally guide interpretations, though they are not always obvious.  There were no major unanswered questions, nor major ""plot holes"" for me, as I have heard many others complain about.  But I had to think about what I saw and answer those questions for myself or (perhaps the most fun part) discuss them with friends to reach satisfying conclusions.<br/><br/>If you believe that a movie should tell you exactly every little thing that happened, then, perhaps, this is not the movie for you.  I'm glad to see the Wachowskis did not ""sell-out"" or water down this story.  They made what they wanted to make, the way they wanted to do it.  It's nice to see some filmmakers are still willing to break the mold.  I look forward to their future projects.  Thanks guys!<br/><br/>By the way, as far as special effects movies go, this can't disappoint. Who goes to see FX movies for the story anyway?"

","If you want to enjoy this film then just reach back to the Matrix Part I and take Morpheus' advice ... free your mind. Do not take the film too seriously or look for plot flaws or look for deeper meaning in the script. If you do then you will be disappointed. Just sit back, lighten up and take this movie for what it is. It is a celebration of the SFX genius of the trilogy's makers, and an over-the-top ending to the trilogy ... though apparently not an ending to the Matrix franchise.<br/><br/>The SFX were the most impressive I have ever seen including the first film. They were simply brilliant. The plot was somewhat engaging, and many of the questions from the second film were answered. The film moves along pretty quickly, although it does intentionally slow down at several points.<br/><br/>
Overall, this was much, much better than Part II, which I found confusing and inappropriate at times (too much bumping and grinding for a franchise this popular). This saved the series for me and solidified it as a franchise that has cemented its place in SFX history. <br/><br/>-- DP."
"Ull","1","3","6","8 November 2003"," Disappointed
","I'll keep this short: There was no need for Matrix Revolutions. It should have ended with Reloaded. Revolutions gives nothing to the story, except five minutes in the end. It gives us a lot of characters we don't care about, a few cool action-sequences, very little dialog (most of which is not interesting), and... I don't know. I was just very, very disapointed - Morpheus is almost written out of the movie (and he used to be Cool!), they are hardly inside the Matrix itself, the movie is drowning in CGI and effects that does little to drive the story, all of the hand-to-hand fight scenes have been done before in previous Matrix-movies. This movie brings NOTHING new to the Matrix-universe.<br/><br/>A great letdown. A wasted chance. My oppinion: Watch the Matrix, see some parts of Matrix Reloaded, and exchange the last 5 minutes of that movie with 5 minutes of the ending of Revolutions. You don't need to see more.<br/><br/>This was such a waste..."

","This is it, the last film in the trilogy that should answer all your questions that you had about the first and second and give you a good feeling inside, right? Well, I left a little down because I still had questions. This installment of the Matrix was the last half of a two-part movie. Through the chilling attack of Zion to Neo's journey to the world above, there was a decent plotline to hold onto even though it really unfolds in the last third of the movie. I was dissapointed for three resons. One, because I thought the directors left some things unanswered that I felt were necessary in the understanding of the story. For example-Neo's power outside the Matrix was not clearly explained. Second, I thought in the fight for time, the elements such as plot and development were a little watered down. Thirdly, they left us with a very pessimistic view of the future of the human race. I did like the allusions to Christianity placed in the movie, and I thought overall the fight and battle sequences were outstanding. The directors do a good job of giving us the full extent of the machine world also, but I was let down by expecting more than the Wachowski Bros. were willing to give us. Overall--- gotta give her a 7 cause It didn't deliver like 1 and 2."

"liamazzi","10","3","6","5 November 2003"," A Masterpiece
","I've just returned from the cinema, and i totally loved this film. It goes in as one of my all time favourite movies ever.<br/><br/>Matrix Revolutions Spoilers.. Dont want to know? Please dont read on..<br/><br/>The machines didn't create the matrix for power. that was a lie. it was an excuse. the machines created the matrix to understand humans, to learn from them... the whole reason behind the matrix was because of the humans not accepting the machines as equals.<br/><br/>they never learned love. they couldn't - it's too complex. but they now understand it, obviously. they understand that it's not just a little thing, like rama said, ""love is just a word"". so now they don't actually need the matrix, because they've found out what it is to love... the final human emotion they needed to learn.<br/><br/>Neo having come into contact with The White Room ( "" The process has altered your Consciousness..."",and choosing the Door not chosen by the previous Ones, saving Trinity with the power of Mind and Energy over not just the Digital but the Physical as well, He NOW realizes something the previous one's did not. That in the Real World..like in The Matrix,. ""there is No Spoon"" he has become changed and He has *changed himself* both subconsiously and consciously. Most Humans only use like 5% to 10% of their Brain (or there Mind)(some people barely use 1% of there Brain/Mind though too). He can now utilize his body's own energy to tranform/convert it into a massive or focused Electro Magnetic Pulse Wave. Neo i think is now using a great portion of his Brain and/or his part of is Mind most people don't like maybe using 20-30% of his Brain capabilities/processes. An ""Awakening"" in the Real World...The next step in Human Evolution... a ""Re-evolution"" perhaps? (Revolutions? hmm?)<br/><br/>
A sort of Bio-Electrical has already been mentioned before in ""The Matrix."" The Machines aparently in some part use the Humans as living batteries or perhaps ""used to"" use them as such, but may have alternate means to power themselfs now.(Maybe a Fusion Reactor or Geo-Thermal Power Plant to power things.<br/><br/>Such Bio-Electrical engery in humans in the ""universe of the Matrix Trilogy"" is hinting that it is or *related to* ""KI"" the life force enrgy decribed in nearly all forms of traditional martial arts. This ""Ki"" IRL people that study and practive the tradition methodology and stlyes of martial art feels and asian hollistic healer feel that IRL ""Ki"" or "" Ch'i"" acutall DOES exsists in the Real Life. In the Matrix Trilogy, there's no reason that ""Bio-Electrical Energy"" and/or ""Ki"" can or can't exsist in the fictional, literary sense. I feel Neo is using his Ki, Mind and Body first accidently, then as time moves on..more focused and a realised, more skilled at using his ""gifts""/abilities/powers. Other people still plugged into the Matrix can have some of there own ""Gifts"" as well like the Oracle's Orphans ~the other ""Potentials"" or even the Rebels to a certian extent are not only Using the power of belief/ and the Mind's power but on some level utilizing their own ""Ki"" or ""Ch'i"" as it is called in Kung Fu. (This ""Ki"" which is possibly the same as or related to the bodies Bio-electric energy/impluses.)<br/><br/>Neo is likely meta-transmuting his ""Ki"" /Bio-Electrical Engery in the Real World into a E.M.P blast a sort E.M. Telekenesis in a sense. This doesn't have to be ""magical"" or ""supernatural"" in anyway... just another aspect of the Universe and a human's connection to "" reality"" that alot of humans don't yet understand or fully realize.<br/><br/>Neo collapsed into a coma because he used up the ammont of internal energy a Tri-Athelete would have over the course of time, Neo used up the same amount of his ""energy"" in a mere few seconds when he halted and fried the Sentinals. Neo will have to learn to not use up so much of his ""energy"" at once and to better control his newfound power.<br/><br/>Smith, having been ""destroyed"" by Neo, had a portion of Neo's Mind in ""code form"" in the Matrix ""Imprinted"" onto Smith, "" unplugging him from the system"", Smith has in essence become like ""The One"" but the flip-side of ""The One"".. an Anti-One, still being a SENTIENT Program ""Entity"" he is now also a VIRUS in the System, that can INFECT and *assimilate* other Programs and the mind-code of anyone in/connected/plugged into the Matrix. Smith Assimilated Banes ""mind""-as-code and the Hard Line Connection transfered/Downloaded the Smith-dominated/assimilated Mind-Code into the Real World Bane. Thus ""Smith"" or at least Copy of Smith is in Bane's Brain. Bane is no longer himself as can easily seen in Reloaded and Revolutions.<br/><br/>
Only Smith and his copies have this "" abilty"" due the the the ""imprint"" of The One's Mind-Code in them... this has NEVER happened before, and most Logical thinking Machines thought using a similar technique would be counter-productive to all Machines and Sentient Program Entities to *Understanding Human-nature/Emotions and LOVE* which is what the PURPOSE of the Matrix had turned out to become only after The Machines no longer neeeded the Humans as ""Batteries"".... Or maybe didnt need them at all? Or discovered that they were not gaining power - but losing it?<br/><br/>It's ironic that the very thing he lectured Morpheous about, that Humans are a ""Virus, a Plague of this World"" (i.e. Earth"" that now Smith HIMSELF is now a Virus, the virtual Cancer of the World of the Matrix...<br/><br/>Now its obvious that the machines were not using the humans as a power source. This is why the W. Bros had to show the sky. They proved that the machines could reach the sky and thus have the sky be a power source. If the sun could be a power source then the humans were not needed for electrical power but for power of knowledge. In my mind the Matrix was the machines attempt to understand how peace could be obtained with a species they had no comprehension of.<br/><br/>Smith is the Virus, Neo is The Cure. They cancel each other out. Like an equasion. Neo realises that he does not need to fight. He sacrifices himself to save humanity.<br/><br/>Love, Peace and Death.<br/><br/>Matrix Revolution is one of the best films and conclusions ever. Its Perfect. Its a masterpiece.<br/><br/>9.9/10"

Endless, and I mean endless, dialogue scenes by secondary Zion characters, spouting bad Star Wars dialogue.  Endless scenes of The Council, another embarassing Star Wars/Star Trek-type contrivance (who dresses these people)?

No cool Kung Fu skill or moves--just endless, in-your-face assaults.  Totally ridiculous.<br/><br/>As for the ending itself--THIS is what we were being led to?  Ridiculous. Everything about the first movie and a good part of the second--the wittiness, the cool questions unanswered, the idea of reality and what is real... are completely ditched in what can be best described as a rote, sci-fi hack job that may be marginally better than the new Star Wars movies, but actually pails compared to something like Starship Troopers.

This film is not the best in the series, in fact it's the worst if you look at the three films individually. Much less complicated than the first two (especially Reloaded) this movie is a little slow to start but ironically it is only when the characters leave the Matrix that the real action begins. The ""real"" world and Zion are the settings that dominate this film, much like the Matrix dominated the first two. That is because the previous two films were about the destruction and mystery of the Matrix, while this film is about the end of the war. And while the battles are fought in the Matrix the war is fought in the real world. To sum up I love this movie as an action movie because that is what it is. The other two films have more depth and that's why they are better but this is a supreme action film and a good wrap up to a phenomenal trilogy."

The problem is, that The Matrix was released without any warning, and most people did not know what the matrix was about due to minimal advertisements.  When Reloaded was released the expectations were so high because The Matrix was a movie that revolutionized movie making.  Most trilogies are structured this way, including the classic Star Wars Trilogy, and I believe this was the best way to expand and finish the Matrix mythology created in 1999.  The <br/><br/>Matrix, the movie that began it all, remains to be the best film out of this trilogy due to its phenomenal influence of a new beginning of film making for future films.<br/><br/>9/10  The Matrix / 7/10  The Matrix Reloaded / 8/10  The Matrix Revolutions"

","This is the same review as the first one. It still sucks.<br/><br/>I have so many fatal flaws to discuss that it is difficult to imagine that this movie was ever produced. It just goes to show you that Hollywood is all about whores and money. That is what this movie is, a whore mongering, greedy, money making of BS and horrible writing.<br/><br/>Hey, I'm like so many others and love the music and various individual scenes. However, the fight scenes become boring and a yawn fest. Once you realize that Neo is the One then all fight scenes are boring. He won't ever lose. He always wins. So what is the purpose of these elaborate fight scenes? Several fatal flaws in the movie are 1) the title: A matrix by definition has been used and abused by Hollywood for years.<br/><br/>1) the need for land-line phones in the matrix is ridiculous. The creator of the matrix made the land-line phones. They are the matrix along with all the buildings, all the people, etc etc etc.<br/><br/>2) the hackers go in and out of the matrix using land-line phones. They need someone to get them in and out, so how do they get in? No one is there to answer the phone.<br/><br/>3) Why not use EMP's all through out the tunnels with motion sensors to defeat the machines<br/><br/>4) How could the machines not know where Zion is located?<br/><br/>5) the entire idea of the skies being scorched is interesting but it doesn't change the need to use humans for energy. Did you see the lighting in the clouds? Holy crap. Those machines could tap in to the lighting and power a billion cities for decades with just a few lightning bolts. Why use humans? Just kill them all off and be done with it.<br/><br/>6) the idea of a machine and AI (artificial intelligence) is a fun story but why are the machines bothering to do this and since they already know that they are created by humans then why stay on Earth? Why not go in to outer space? Why not explore the Universe? If so, then why go in to the Universe? The machine would already calculate that there is no god and there for existence is futile. They would become Buddha and thus peaceful.<br/><br/>7) Why does Neo bother to fly. If he has control over the matrix and he is a simulation, why doesn't he just teleport to various areas. Why be limited by flight? 9) Why are the machines human like? Where is the precision? Why emotions? The movie contradicts itself on this part.<br/><br/>8) If Neo can leap in to an agent and bust them open why not do it again rather than fight them? Why doesn't he hack them? Make them his own. Why bother to fight with fists?<br/><br/>I'd love to see a Robot Chicken where the machines vs the humans is just a video game being played by some kid on a PlayStation. That would be freaking hilarious.<br/><br/>Look the entire movie is fun to watch but as a whole it completely sucks 100%. It is a really crappy, entirely crap fest filled with so many fatal flaws that I rank it as one of the worst movies of all times with one of the largest budgets ever to be wasted.<br/><br/>1/10 stars because of poor execution. The writers smoked way too much weed and were high when they wrote this movie. They also didn't understand anything about computers or the hacking or the logic of programming."

","In some ways I considered some small things in ""Revolutions"", to be better than ""Reloaded"". But ultimately it leaves more questions left unanswered, and I found it lacking enough material for its 2 hour running time. For a finale in a very well received trilogy that spawned plenty of merchandise and even a new fashion sense, ""Revolutions"" hasn't aged well for me and represented the turning point where the series would become a shell of it's former self.<br/><br/>I like certain elements of the story in this one as we spend more time in the ""real world"", preparing for a war that has been talked about since the beginning. The time spent in ""The Matrix"" is pretty slow, yet the finale is anything but. For as much as everything feels very anticlimactic, it definitely can't help but feel like it tries to answer questions that aren't going to fulfil expectations regardless how brilliant they could possibly be.<br/><br/>The Wachowski siblings end things well enough. The atmosphere looks edgy, and the choreography and slow motion really help depict the odds against Neo (Keanu Reeves). But after all I've said, I can't really find any other strong reasons to say the finale is a must see. I loved it as a kid, but on repeated viewings years later it just doesn't hold up.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Ending everything well enough to say it isn't a horrible movie, but ""anticlimactic"" best sums up ""The Matrix Revolutions"". 5/10."

","This is probably one of the poorest produced film ever made... The only reason this film has received 6,5 (right now) stars is because of the first film The Matrix which is genius, at least in comparison to the last one. <br/><br/>The W. brothers have probably thought wouldn't it be cool if we could do this... or if we could make him/they do that... Regarding to all the insane moves and effects implemented in this film. Thus removing the film from a possibly good story and to a film filled with poor effects and catastrophically poor storyline.....<br/><br/>There is no continuity in the story whatsoever, jumping from tale to tale. Ie. in the first movie Neo finally had no problem with the matrix' guardian ""the agents"". Proving with stopping the bullets fired at him and entering a part of the matrix (Agent Smith) and destroying it from within (also a hint of what to come from the sequels) Yet in these sequels both the ""ordinary"" agents and agent Smith (although they have been upgraded) sometimes are beating the CRAP out of NEO. Following the abilities he realized he had in the first movie, no matter what the matrix would have thrown at him, Neo should have passed with ease through the trials. Finally great filming and stunt-performing have been replaced with BEYOND CRAPPY CGI! It is almost impossible to imagine how they could have made the CGI any worse.... (at a pro-level) besides leaving the task to a high-school student.<br/><br/>To create a new nemesis for Neo, either in the form of new characters, problems or new abilities he would have to face, surely must have been a difficult task! One that unfortunately have been handled extremely poor ....<br/><br/>Finally anyone rating this one to their top ten have never seen: Pulp Fiction, Usual Suspects, Schindlers List, Anyone of the first three Star Wars, the two Inidana Jones films in the middle, Leon, Se7en, A Clockwork Orange, Platoon, Trainspotting, both Kill Bill ( and every other Tarantino film). There are of course several hundred films I would CLEARLY rate higher than this one.... So if you want a good movie on a Friday night, this is NOT one of them.

Heck Yes.<br/><br/>Is it both liked and hated by fans ? Yes.<br/><br/>Should it be re-watched and appreciated ? Yes. Yes. Yes.<br/><br/>This film is actually pretty good and has just as many Action sequences as the first two. The Wachowski Brothers once again don't bother going into the basics due to the fact that there is already a ton of conflicts between all our protagonists and antagonists that are both old and new ( there even the cool addition of The Trainman ! ). <br/><br/>The first couple of minutes are focused with the disappointing ""cliffhanger"" that happened in Part 2 and is weird, but necessary for closure and, plus, it involves our main protagonists. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the other characters that don't have as much closure, but are also a huge 1/3 of the plot have finished debating from last movie and are literally preparing for ""War and Freedom."" <br/><br/>The antagonists ( bad guys ) are ready to crush them, but also interested in the other conflict that involves our main hero, from the last two films, Neo. The film is mainly focused on his quest to end the war while providing info. on all the other sub-plots. The film generally does what both the other two big epics ""Star Wars"" and Lord of the Rings"" do, they show constantly what everyone is doing on both sides ""back-and-forth."" The last two films are no stranger to this story-telling technique, but it's a lot more noticeable here because it's constantly intense then the last two films. <br/><br/>As for the movie's final conflict, which involves Neo and Smith finally meeting ""face-to-face,"" it is simply one of the best fights between both the good and bad guy that I have ever seen ! Why no one thinks that is crazy because this is the most epic point in the entire series, which is to finally determine the faith of the movie's universe and characters. <br/><br/>The questions from last film are not given enough thought nor are they explained clearly, but no one should blame this film because they never had real significance to the overall film anyway and, plus, Part 2 is guilty for even conjuring the ideas in the first place. I personally believe that the Wachowski Brothers just wanted to get their audience thinking while they were in awe at the entire massive-scale battles and impressive visual imagery expressed in all films combined. <br/><br/>As for the ending, I thought it was pretty tight, but everyone just criticized the film just for that one thing and I betcha they were enjoying the film just up until that pint, but yet did not understand the significant to the Wachowski's wisdom and ""tongue-in cheek"" humor. What the brothers were conjuring up was an unpredictable ending and they succeeded successfully because, in interviews, they have stated how tired they are of the ""same old ending,"" so they decided to do something out the usual, which was what was expressed in this film. <br/><br/>Even if you fans have been spoiled about the particular ending, don't cheat yourself like all the other fans are, see this film and appreciate it like the previous two unless you're not a fan of this series/genre to begin with, which I would then scold you for not being ""open-minded"" enough. <br/><br/>See Now !"

","Okay, I'll be honest. The first time I went to the movie theaters to see this movie I was really, really excited. Reloaded had left me all hyped up and I couldn't wait to see a movie that somehow promised to be the best of the trilogy. As the movie progressed I was unavoidably sucked in into the story, experiencing all kinds of emotions in the process, which varied from happiness, to sadness, to satisfaction, to disappointment, and even to anger. It seemed that with each passing minute not only the mood of the movie got darker, but also my expectations and hopes of it being the greatest of the Matrix series.<br/><br/>Some characters were utterly wasted and misused (the Merovingian and Seraph come to mind)and I know that the war of machines vs. humans is a cool concept for many, but may I remind everyone that the movie is called the ""MATRIX"" Revolutions? The scenes of humans defending against the machines were really well executed, no doubt about it. But after watching for more than fifteen minutes nothing more than bullets /flashes / fire / bullets/ more flashes/ many more bullets / many, many more flashes and fire it tends to get a little bit tedious. There I was, expecting to see Neo and crew kick some Exiles'and Agents' butts with mind-bending effects (only possible within the virtual computer world the Wachowskis created), but instead all I get to see is what I would expect to see in a Star Wars movie: ships flying, robots dying. I will admit, though, that the few scenes (specially the Super Burly Brawl) that take place within the matrix were awesome, but I also will admit that they were too short for anyone's good. <br/><br/>This are just some of the major weak points one will find in Revolutions. Why then, you wonder, do I grade this movie with an 8/10 if all the things I say about it are negative? Well, all I will say is that the story was rich in content and extremely beautiful, but the way it was delivered on the big screen left many things to desire. It still won't ruin the series for a true Matrix fan, but the same thing cannot be said about most people. I guess that after all Neo was still... only human..."
"colin-deshong","9","2","4","13 May 2006"," A Mind-Blowing Experience!
","First off, if you're unfamiliar with technical terminology, or references, you will become somewhat lost in this film's actual meaning.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions, being the final installment in the Matrix trilogy, definitely sets a tone of sci-fi, yet realistic approach to gravity, technology, and the future, as it may seem.<br/><br/>With an expected finish, the Matrix Revolutions is probably the most complex movie trilogy to be released for a long time. The Wachowski Brothers are exceptional at including hidden meanings and interpretive characters.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil the movie, but it's definitely a fun movie to watch, and has a ton of information and amazing details that you'll pick up on. I strongly recommend you watch the previous movies in the trilogy before you watch the Matrix: Revolutions. Primarily so that you understand all the meaning behind the characters and the circumstances.<br/><br/>There are many religious references that you could take from characters such as Neo, Trinity, the Oracle, and many others, but it's best if you figure that out on your own. The names of the characters, their circumstances, and the storyline of the actual movie all relate to biblical events or characters which makes this movie, in my opinion, one of the most interesting ones released in years!"

","Some of the shots in this movie cut together would make a great visual effects reel, and would be much more enjoyable than suffering through the entire film.<br/><br/>The writing is awful on every level imaginable. Dialogue is full of insulting exposition (characters explicitly describing their motivations and feelings for the audience) and centers around trying to explain things like discrepancies in the casting of the oracle due to the unfortunate passing of the original actress and why a slew of new powers/characters/areas of the matrix were invented in the 2nd movie.<br/><br/>They should have focused on larger problems like story sense. Morpheus's last line is, ""I've dreamed of this moment my whole life"", in reference to the bullet-loading kid explaining that the war with the machines is over. Did they forget that the principal reason they were fighting the war was to liberate imprisoned people's minds from the matrix? The twenty minute fight between Neo and Smith is pointless and feels pointless because it's been very clearly established that punching each other has no lasting consequence. There are lesser issues like this abound throughout the film but the real achilles heel of the story is as follows, starting with the 1st Matrix (a great movie):<br/><br/>Let's find the One, he will destroy the Matrix and free all the humans, Neo is the One, and he blew up agent smith! Bringing down the matrix and freeing all of our minds should be no sweat now. Wait agent smith is back and there a bunch of new haphazardly conceived obstacles to throw in our hero's path jeopardizing his quest to destroy the Matrix. Oh no, agent smith has embodied this guy Bane in the real world and the machines are attacking Zion, this complicates the quest to destroy the matrix. The machines are in Zion they're hurting the residents, but Neo sacrifices himself to allow agent smith to be destroyed, Zion will be spared! The End.<br/><br/>I would worship this movie if the credits started rolling right after the kid says, ""the war is over!"" and Locke says his line, ""this doesn't make sense."""

","I just now saw Revolutions--May of 2005. I was in no hurry after seeing Reloaded.<br/><br/>Of course, we all should have known by the very titles that the movies were going to be what they were--we held out, though, thinking ""Maybe this is just the advertising side, the depth will be there."" Matrix Squared and Cubed would have sent a different message. Or, my favorite names would have been The Determinant and The Jacobian.<br/><br/>One IMDb reviewer's idea of an alien super-ruse was great. I was thinking more visually, though...I kept wondering why in the rainy dual with Neo & Smith, Inc., we got Rain Drop Time rather than Lightning Time. How cool would it have been if when Smith pulled out some supersonic Kung Fu, Neo had countered by going into Lightning Time. We could have had tunnelized redshifting, maybe even some backward causality rather than two bullies seeing just how deep in the mud they could push one another.<br/><br/>And what about the Great Buddha Oz at the end made out of Sentinals? What machine logic to that? And hmmm...Okay, (says the machine) since you say I need you, I'll bind myself to a promise not to do the one thing I seem to have been trying to do for a century--and keep the promise.<br/><br/>And just why is a human culture that can build The Forbidden Planet in less than a century incapable of creating smart weapons to seek and destroy swarming Sentinals? Oh, the big advance in RPGs, I see, is that the launchers are double-barreled. And while the security team runs the place on holographic imaging screens, the shells are made by mixing gun powder with a mortar and pestle. And is there a reason that there wouldn't be EMF impulse weapons in Zion apart from the ships? Anyone think of trying to direct that blue bubble and create a usable device? And as a commander, do you typically leave a suspected psychotic trying to destroy humanity unguarded? And when your only resource is down to human lives, stop to debate whether a 16-year-old should be on the battlefield? And where are the women among the mega-botic gun platform operators? Did I just miss them, or is Zion traditionalist after all?<br/><br/>And why was it that the Smith-Zombie traitor cut himself, again? Why was it that the fire-seeing Neo couldn't save Trinity this time? Why didn't Smith #1 let his millions help him out when things looked bad in the rain storm? Why did the Sentinals in the launch bay fly around in circles together rather than doing the one thing they were there to do--destroy? If that's how a Sentinal works, I'll use Daleks when I take over the world--powered by Linux, of course.<br/><br/>Let's face it, the business built around the Matrix was not cinema, it was video game. And sadly, even for a video game market, high-schoolers would have exercised much more imagination."

","First of all, we have to consider the great crisis that people are having with ""being critics"" in the film industry. Now a days we see people enjoying a movie just because it offers them a nice relaxing moment, no need to think about the story itself, but even worse, people still maintain their conception en thinking that a movie must have its traditional ending and easy going dialogs that don't include any benefit in the real world. Matrix is an exception, we have to consider that its the first movie to ever bring up a new conception of filming and even better, bring real time statements of humanity's problematic existence. I now that the the movie suffered many changes through its trilogy development (many because of the director's ambitions and the industry's demands), but the plot itself and the essence of the story is still there. Just because a great majority of the people cant get use to this kind of stories and this new way of creating cinematography, is a demonstration of the lack of interest from the audience in having real-dealing-problem movies.

I was desperate to see this movie and was first in the queue at the cinema.<br/><br/>Neo somehow has entered a state of limbo between the real and the Matrix and then manages to get out - i forget exactly how, (it was a while ago and i haven't watched it again). Anyway, with sentinels (alot of them) closing in on Zion, time is running out for what's left the human race.<br/><br/>Neo figures out how he can beat the machines, but he's not letting us know just yet, so he and Trinity take a ship and set off to the machine city, so Neo can do what his has to do.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the sentinels attack Zion (The best action sequence in the film, by far) it all takes place in the real world, but it is done with style.<br/><br/>As Trinity and Neo make their way to the machine city, SHOCK, Trinity dies; this worked well. <br/><br/>But, then Neo has a chat with the machines and gets them to plug him in to the Matrix to defeat agent Smith, who is running amok and threatening the destruction of both man and machine. Neo, now fighting to save both sides has a showdown with Smith that is at best disappointing (it was like Superman fighting the super villains in Superman 2 - not disrespect to superman, he can carry a fight like this off)) the effects were better but, it wasn't good. Anyway, Neo wins with the help of the Oracle and then he dies, and the machines carry him off like a hero.<br/><br/>I admit that my recollection of these events is a little vague, but the feeling they left me with was one of shattered illusions, they just seem to have ran out of ideas for this one, and it was a huge let down.<br/><br/>I have read a few good reviews, that say their is more than meets the eye here. So i will watch it again, because i would love to be wrong in my perception. If i am wrong i will post a new comment, but for now i'll leave you with this, Most of the film is outside the Matrix and most of these scenes did deliver, but inside the Matrix the fights were quite tired. One is a rehash of the lobby scene in the original and the other is a Superman style borathon. Additionally the story loses itself and its original motives, leaving too many holes and unanswered questions.<br/><br/>Just 6/10 and that's kind."

This is what happened for those who do not understand. Mr. Smith was a program inside the matrix that turned out to be a virus (i hope everybody got that!). Mr. Smith kept on multiplying (just like a real computer virus) causing a real problem inside the matrix for both the machines and the humans. As you can see, the machines and humans had a COMMON problem. So thats why Neo decides to unite with them at the end. Now for those who do not understand how Neo kills Mr Smith: In the end, the master machine connects Neo to the matrix, allowing him to fight Mr Smith. Keep in mind that Mr. Smith is a program and that Neo is connected by the master machine. When mister smith finally gives Neo the final blow and turns him into one of his clones, it allowed the master machine to get the old of Mr. Smith program and destroy it.

After about forty scenes with long, pretentious dialogue the film then delivers...more scenes of gibberish exposition. The Wachowskis probably think/wish that it has some deep meaning, but it really is just mumbo-jumbo.<br/><br/>Neo now has the ability to use some of his Matrix powers in the real world, while a copy of Agent Smith has 'possessed' one of the humans. Hundreds of thousands of Sentinels are just feet away from breaking into Zion, and the digital Agent Smith takes over the entire Matrix after overwriting the Oracle.<br/><br/>The Zion battle with the Mechs and Sentinels is kind of exciting, but it's the only part of this 129-minute movie that will quicken your pulse. The rest threatens to stop it permanently. There's plenty of CGI, some it good (the Sentinels) some it horrible (anything with Neo and Smith). The fight scenes are now just a bore. Watching people walk on the ceiling while firing guns doesn't excite me. Watching people slam into wall and making a big hole got old the first hundred times it happened too.<br/><br/>You've never seen a film with such unjustifiable delusions of grandeur.

","The third installment of the Matrix trilogy comes to a close as a bright new `created' sun rises over a city skyline.  Fortunately for the movie audience that just sat through Matrix Revolutions, this `sign' signals the best part of the movie-the end!  <br/><br/>The Matrix and it's sequel Matrix: Reloaded were loaded with eye popping, unbelievable special effects and an evolving, fast-paced, cyber-punk story that caused audiences to think.  Somewhere between Reloaded and Revolutions the creators of this trilogy forgot about what made the first two movies so special.  Instead, they turned it into a blazing gun fight (literally) between man and machine and turned the story into a marsh-mellow, sappy, inconclusive, meandering, insipid battle of good versus evil.  It's almost as if the producers of this movie `dumbed it down' because the first two were over the audiences heads.<br/><br/>This movie makes about as much sense as three single men marooned with two hot single women on an island and no one ever has sex and no one is ever jealous.  That's right, The Matrix Revolutions is right up there with Gilligan's Island in terms of making sense and making use of an `unimaginable reality'.   Revolutions settles for `cute' when they should have been `sexy'.  They settle for `biblical' when they should've been `mythical'.  They settle for `War' when they should have focused on `turmoil'.  Basically, they settled for Mrs. Howell when they should have gone with Ginger!<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves, who seems perfectly cast as the monotone, savior, Neo, is back in the third installment acting more like a cross between The Professor and Gilligan than a kick-butt, able-to-defy-reality-hero we've come to know in the first two movies.  Suddenly, he's like a kid who's constantly asking `why?' and like an exhausted parent, we get annoyed.   This is his journey, his 40 days and 40 nights in the desert coming to terms with who he is and why he is.  But unlike Christ or Moses from the Bible and Old Testament, his journey isn't that interesting.  Locked away in the world between the Matrix and reality, his quest is fairly tedious and seems to distract us from the movie instead of advancing the story. <br/><br/>There is really very little that advances this story.  It moves along with the expected gun-fights and anger without ever moving forward.  Throughout the first two movies there was a thread that kept the stories from spinning off into the ether of stupidity.  That thread was that there was something `real' to the stories.  The emotions, the actions, the characters all seemed to be steeped in reality allowing us to believe in them and the story  SNIP! Kiss that thread goodbye!  Revolutions has no desire to maintain that.  Like a video game that malfunctions, we find ourselves slamming the arms of our chairs as if they were a game-pad, as we curse the screen to get back to where we were.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a bad video game.  The special effects remain amazing, and for that reason alone, I'm glad I saw this in the theater.  But like most video games it's all about an action sequence that leads to another action sequence with no concern for story.  The characters pass by too quickly in this tale of `faith' and perseverance in a cyber-world gone horribly awry.  Even Lawrence Fishburne is reduced to somewhat of a minor role as he and Jada Pinkett-Smith exchange steamy glances.  Two characters from Reloaded: Merovingian and his busty companion Persephone make a brief appearance, but they don't really serve a purpose.  We visit the Oracle again and we're introduced to some creepy looking train conductor who is dead-set against Neo getting on board the train!  But that whole point just comes and goes with little effect on the movie.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back in Zion, the BIG WAR is waged against the tentacle monsters from the machine world.  This battle is fought with man-powered mechanical suits with HUGE guns and gutsy women with bazookas.  The war turns into an old-fashioned `give em Hell' John Wayne type of event.  Ripe with a hard fighting, never-say-die leader, who spits out orders and cheesy dialogue nearly as fast as his guns empty of ammo. The fighting is epic and again, the special effects are fantastic, but somehowthis should've been in a different movie.   This seems to go against everything else the Matrix movies have been about:  The computer-generated world, the small band of `resistance fighters', an agent who is like a virus detector in the system, control of when to be `plugged in', intense, cliff-hanger type skirmishes and a reluctant hero fighting against logic and reason to save the world<br/><br/>While the Matrix and Matrix: Reloaded were focused and intelligent, this one seems to try to cover too much in too short a period of time.  There's Neo in `limbo', the impending attack on Zion, the counsel of Zion and the angry General, Morpheus and Niobe, rescuing Neo, preparing for battle, the love story of Neo and Trinity, Agent Smith, the WAR, the land of the machines, the multiple Agent Smith's and his ability to `assimilate' his enemies, the list goes on and little of it is done well.  <br/><br/>Revolutions provides nothing revolutionary.  We've seen all this before in countless action-no-in countless war movies with better story lines and much better dialogue.  I think more than anything, that's what really disappoints me.  The fact that the first two movies seemed so fresh and cool, everything about them was new from the dark look to the fight scenes and the bad-ass sunglasses.  Revolutions reverts to an old-fashioned movie about war and remembrance, almost as if it was meant to be attached to something else. This movie leaves us wondering `what could have been'?  Like, what if the Skipper ran off with Ginger to the other side of the island and the professor and Gilligan had to fight over Mary Ann!"
"openeyes","Null","2","4","25 April 2004"," Everything that has a beginning must (thankfully) end
","I'll never forget when I first saw ""The Matrix.""  It was a free sneak preview screening.  The price was right for me, because all I knew about the film was that it starred Keanu Reeves, and that had long ceased being an enticement for me to plunk down cold hard cash at the box office.  I had no expectations about the film and, much to my surprise,  it blew me away. It was thrilling and inventive; filled with mystery and portents.  And Keanu Reeves was surprising good.  For the most part all the script asked him to do was act bewildered, and he does bewilderment well.  All and all, it was one of the best science fiction films I had seen at the movies in a long time-- and remains so until this day.  Despite the fact that when you analyze the film logically, it doesn't make much sense.  But who cared? It isn't like the film makers had to weave a comprehensive logical world view from the basic setup of the movie.  No, they wouldn't have to do that unless they decided to stretch the film out into a trilogy.  (Shouldn't be too hard, they must've thought.  George Lucas did it, and was doing it again.)<br/><br/>I anxiously awaited the sequel.  I saw it with a large group of equally-psyched friends and acquaintances on its opening weekend. Everyone hated it.  Except me.  They thought it was too talky, but, I found the free will versus determinism, chance versus purpose, debate interesting.  They also thought the action set-pieces were too overblown and self-indulgent to be enjoyed.  I disagreed.  I thought the set-pieces were some of the best I have seen in years.  Still, the criticism of my friends rang true in places. Yes, the actual Zion was disappointing, perhaps even ridiculous, compared to the place we imagined in the first film, and, yes, the conflict between Neo and Smith was considerably less compelling in an environment where neither of them could really kill the other.  (Freddy vs. Jason, anyone?) However, I kept hope alive.  ""Reloaded"" was only the middle film of the trilogy.  The stopgap.  The last one had to be better.  (Then again... The second film of the original Star Wars trilogy was the best, and, furthermore, the middle film of the Godfather trilogy was arguably the best too.)<br/><br/>Thus came ""The Matrix Revolutions.""  Missed it at the theaters.  I wanted to see it, but I like to go to the movies with other people and no one I knew would see it!  Bought the DVD the first day it came out.  Anxiously put it into the machine, and discovered, to my surprise, it was freaking terrible. I can't think of a single good thing to say about it.  Why did I hate it? Let me count the ways...<br/><br/>Neo and Trinity.  The romance worked better in the first film than the second.  Not surprising since romance is often more exciting to watch in its initial bloom of growth and longing than in its day-to-day application. In the first film, we watched Neo and Trinity get to know each other, and we learned about them ourselves in the process.  We wanted them to get to get together, and they did.  In the second film, they are together.  So what? Where's the growth and sense of discovery?  The third film simply takes their already static relationship and deifies it into a symbol of all love. They have stopped being people we can identify with.  Yawn.<br/><br/>The pace.  Nothing happens for the first hour or so.  Stupid problems are created only to be dismissed simplistically.  Take, for example, the trainman.  Neo can't beat him and as a result could be trapped forever in limbo between the machine world and the matrix.  One could easily make a compelling movie about this problem alone, but they don't bother here.  It is simply a diversion to let the film makers position the rest of the pieces in the game.  Look how ridiculously easy it is for Trinity and Morpheus to get him out.  After a perfunctory battle shamelessly and lifelessly rehashed from the first film, they meet up with the great villain, the Frenchman, who waxes philosophically like a blowhard for what seems to be an eternity before Trinity simply puts a gun to his head.  I suppose this was supposed to be a comic moment along the lines of Indiana Jones just shooting the sword-wielding Arab, but, if that was the case, why not just get it over with quicker.  Then the Frenchman disappears from the movie.  The second movie went to great lengths to set him up, but now he's simply dismissed from the film.  Then again, I suppose he was lucky.  I had still had over an hour to go.<br/><br/>The action set-pieces.  The machine attack on Zion had all the thrills of a great video game.  However, even the most exciting video game gets boring to watch when you know you're not going to have a turn at the controls.  I didn't give a darn about any of the characters involved.   Unlike the characters lovingly established in the first movie, the battle for Zion was being fought by a group of one-dimensional stereotypes established in the second film.  It was all special effects without heart.  However, it was not anywhere as ridiculous as the final battle between Neo and Smith.  I found their midair battles nothing short of laughable.  This is the battle I waited almost six hours for?  Give me a freaking break!<br/><br/>I remember all the criticism of the first two Star War prequels.  Sure, those films had their problems.  There was too much Jar-Jar in the first one and too much Hayden Christensen in the second one, but they remained entertaining to a degree at their core, particularly on DVD when one can skip a chapter here and there.  That cannot be said of ""Matrix Revolutions."" Despite the millions of dollars spent, and the work of so many talented craftspeople, the film simply cannot even hold my attention.<br/><br/>Everything that has a beginning has an end.<br/><br/>Thank God we reached it."

","I thought the movie was great.  I'm a late-comer to the series, and so just recently saw this in a second-run movie theater.  I thought it was fantastic.  One of the quickest two hours I've ever spent watching a movie, it was that exciting.<br/><br/>Potential spoiler: I admit I only rated it a 8, but that was because of the train station scene at the beginning that other than take time did not add any meaning to the main story.  So I do not think this is really a spoiler because it doesn't affect the plot at all.  Also, parts of the ending left me guessing, but that was not a major issue and led to some decent discussions with others about what happened.<br/><br/>My guess is the reason the movie has gotten such bad feedback is the original set such high expectations that they could never realistically be met.  Clear your mind and accept it at face value and you will see an exciting movie."

There was way too much inter-character dialogue about absolutely nothing, and nothing new, innovative, or interesting to drive the story.

","Note:  The comments in this movie will have spoilers so you have been warned.<br/><br/>Finally putting my two cents in this good movie that finally ends the trilogy series.  The movie overall was very good but left a lot of questions unanswered such as will the Zion program will continue in a loop and when will Neo comes back (to name a few).  <br/><br/>Special effects were excellent and the actors were also.  The movie in the box office was a let down because it came to soon.  If it would have came out this year then it would definitely beat out the second movie easily. But don't worry the actors and the W Bros are probably set for life as well as Mr. Smith (Hugo Weaver) is definitely set for life since his other movie, ""The Return of the King"" is making a killing.<br/><br/>The Dark Gengar gives this good movie from one Gengar to ten Gengars:  Nine Gengars.

"FilmLabRat","8","2","4","25 December 2003"," allegory for Christian faith
","Very clever plot and philosophical concepts discussed and illustrated, this movie is in some ways a work of genius that was unfortunately diminished by its excesses.  All the overstimulation of machinery (overly long battles) and sometimes ""over the top"" melodrama took away from the great themes, plot and potential this story held.  I would love to see the Bros. Wachowski try to do this kind of thing again, next time with the awareness that ""less is more.""  The film included not only deep thoughts about personal choices and appointed time to die but even many allegories to the Christian faith, whether the writers knew it or not.  No, there is no God the Father to whom Neo prays and is like in esssence.  Yes, a couple other faiths are remotely linked.  But it's amazing how the spiritual battle is accurately depicted and how Neo is more than just a prophet.  I loved the depiction of blindness leading to increased sight and other inversions of perception, just as spiritual values are inverted from worldly materialism and perception. [POSSIBLE SPOILER:]  Neo actually takes on the very form of evil in order to destroy it - just as Christ took the curse of sin and death on himself and was separated from God in order to win victory for the human race to triumph over evil.  Remarkable and interesting writing -- just a little too much of a good thing, in a number of places."

"artscribe24","9","2","4","29 November 2003"," Great Filmmaking, Little Appreciated
","""The Matrix: Revolutions"" made me revisit my opinion of ""Reloaded,"" which had made me wonder what had happened to the Wachowski Brothers' judgment. I felt that they had lost their sense of pacing and structure in ""Reloaded."" Well, I now realize how much I missed from that movie. And ""Reloaded"" was, indeed, only half of a protracted movie sequel to the original. It's a pity that so many have put down this incredible filmmaking feat in such crass terms as I've seen here and among the ""professional"" reviews. The ""Matrix"" trilogy managed to succeed at more levels than I would have thought, and not just the technical levels that many have grudgingly admitted.  Parts II and III defied expectations set up by the original, and I think that is why they have been attacked so strongly.  But these movies dared to go further, defying expectations, opening up a WORLD of characters and events, and, apparently, taking movie boers beyond the limits of what they are conditioned to expect. In time, more people will come to appreciate this series."
"mentalcritic","2","2","4","30 November 2003"," Shining example of what is wrong with Hollywood these days...
","The original Matrix was a Hong-Kong-cinema-derived action extravaganza with a huge special effects budget that managed to make a profit, so the makers immediately began claiming it was written as part of a trilogy. Considering that the first story was self-contained and tight on its own level in spite of being a derivative load of garbage, the first words out of my mouth were ""I don't think so"". That, in a nutshell, sums up what I had to say about the final instalment.<br/><br/>My father, after seeing the second episode with me, told me that every single scene went on for too long. Given that this man regards Battlefield Earth as a kind of Citizen Kane, that's a pretty damning indictment. But still, the makers have to press on with this trilogy claim, hoping to squeeze a few more dollars out of the Hollywood system. And then it happens... the film they bring out is, in fact, so bad that it makes me even demand my money back rather than make me kick myself for having spent it in the first place. And I did get it back, believe me.<br/><br/>The main problem with the film is that it makes no sense a lot of the time. And by the way, stop reading now if you give a damn about any surprises in the film. The attack upon Zion is probably the most stellar example of this. Neo finally defeats his nemesis in a manner that is oddly reflective of the way fans of the films attempt to treat those who point out the gap between what the fans make them out to be and what they really are. So with no further ado, the machines, who have no connection whatsoever to said nemesis, pack up and leave with Morpheus screaming that the ""war"" is over and the people of Zion cheering.<br/><br/>I DON'T THINK SO. Anyone who has studied warfare in which the two sides are bent on genocide of each other will know that one side will not just suddenly pack up, leave, and live peacefully on their side of the fence. The war keeps going until the last man in the other side dies, end of story. To end a war like this in the manner shown here makes not the slightest bit of sense. Not that making sense was a strong point of the so-called trilogy to begin with - the reason given for the Matrix's existence is a scientific impossibility.<br/><br/>Continuity is also a problem here. When our beloved Agent ""absorbs"" the Oracle, one is reasonably expectant that she will never be seen again, so what the hell is she doing in the final scene? Then there is the childish posturing and dialogue. Doesn't anyone else get the feeling that the Wachowski brothers went to one too many Sisters Of Mercy concerts and began to wish they could make their videos? Every shot in this film reeks of a pose. Send them back ten years and they'd be a member of Poison or something.<br/><br/>In short, this film is trash, and everyone seems to know it except its fans. The series was trash from the very beginning, but this episode sinks to depths that not even Terminator 3 or Freddy Got Fingered could plumb. Giving it one out of ten is like giving the crippled, retarded child in the back a prize for coming last."
"mrswhite072895","7","2","4","20 November 2003"," Matrix Revolutions is not a perfect movie, but it Rocked
","If you're not a fan of kung fu movies, science fiction movies, war movies, Keanu Reeves' flawless complexion, Laurence Fishburne's pocked complexion, or movies with strong biblical (the New Testament) references, then the final installment in The Matrix Trilogy is not for you. You probably didn't like the first or the second installments, and will be truly disappointed with the third.<br/><br/>Let's get a few things straight first. Matrix Revolutions is not a perfect movie, and neither were its predecessors. There are at least two plot twists that are cliched. There are some questions that remain unanswered from The Matrix Reloaded. The language is stilted, but that was a fault/plus of all The Matrix movies. (It is in my opinion that the stilted language was a stylization by the directors of the movie. It's supposed to flow along like a church hymn. You're supposed to follow the rhythm, and not necessarily the words.) The Matrix, the original, continues to be a stand-alone movie. The movie didn't really require 2 more sequels to answer its mysteries. With all that said, see Matrix Revolutions because it rocked.<br/><br/>The Matrix is still the best in the series, but Matrix Revolutions wraps up things very nicely. I will not give away any plot developments, except to say that maybe you should read the New Testament. The pseudo philosophical and spiritual overtones of Revolutions are not as heavy, muddled or as vague as in the first two movies. The spiritual lesson taught in this movie is simple: You must never give up faith. As a person at the beginning of her spiritual quest, I appreciate the messages and questions the Warchowski (sp?) brothers throw into this series. However, it is a movie and not a religious text.<br/><br/>Most of the scenes in the movie take place in the ""real world,"" so there aren't many visuals of Morpheus in his green 'gator shoes, Trinity in her liquid latex cat suit, or Naiobi in her to-die-for Bantu knots. What you do see is a group of ragged people fighting for peace, and trying not to lose their faith. What you do see is Neo trying to figure out his place in this universe. The Matrix Revolutions does have the hold-your-breath chases, fight scenes, and battles against the machines. (I dare you not to gasp when swarms of machines break through the walls of Zion. It is all at once beautiful and petrifying.)<br/><br/>Matrix Revolutions is definitely a must see. The ending of the film will require some post-viewing analysis, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's a great action film to take you out of your self for a couple of hours. Even if the movie were to shed its religious pretensions, it would still be a great action film to see on the big screen. Don't listen to the haters. Have faith that it will be worth the $10 you invested to see it. Peace!"

","Warning, mild spoilers<br/><br/>The Matrix: Revolutions is not without its flaws.  Keanu Reaves' acting is less than overwhelming, and there are some unlikely ""real world"" sequences. (I emphasize ""real world"" because just about anything can happen in the Matrix.)  But the movie was much better than I had been led to believe by the critics.  I put off seeing this film largely because I expected it to be a failure.  It wasn't.<br/><br/>The story was interesting, not as groundbreaking as in the first installment, but strong enough to keep my interest without going too deeply into esoterica as was often the case in ""Reloaded"".  The battle sequences in Zion were a bit longer than needed but not aggravatingly so.  The concluding fight between Neo and Agent Smith was well done.  The ending was reasonably satisfying and not the downer that I had been led to expect.<br/><br/>It really is a shame that so many critics panned this film.  It deserves a larger audience than it is likely to get.  It will not go down as a great movie but it was enjoyable and held my interest."

We all know he's the one.<br/><br/>3.  Battle scene for Zion -- good, but way too long. There's a point where you start to cheer for the sentinels.<br/><br/>4. (WARNING -- SPOILER -- WARNING)  Gosh, What was the point with the extended death scene for Trinity?   It lasted so long that I was urging Neo to break her neck to put her out of her (and our) misery.<br/><br/>
5.  The Ending ( SPOILER )  It was the only way it could have ended.  I left not liking it at first, but it made sense.  Simply put: From the begining, Neo was the guy that was going to stop the war and free the humans.  He did it.  He created that which threatened both the humans and the machines and he used it to stop the war.  Everyone is happy and life goes on (cept for Neo and Trinity)<br/><br/>
Ok, over all, it was an above average movie.  It wasn't as near as good as the first, but it was a much improved change over the second.  I'm spending the money to see it again and I'm buying the DVD.. I give it 8 out of 10. (Doubters..go see it again!)"

","To: The non-thinkers of the World<br/><br/>What is the Matrix? I know what the Matrix is, yet what it is is not in the movie. The movie is a Allegory to events in our world. It's not to be found on the movie screen. The message is encrypted, so to speak, you just need to know the primer like in the message transmitted in the movie Contact. The message is embedded beneath the images not in the picture.<br/><br/>Here is what I mean. Remember at the very end of The Matrix (1999); Neo is in the phone booth and he warns the machine that he is going to show these people what you don't want them to see and he fly's. Well, something alone that line, you all seem to know the movie backwards and forwards. Yet the next two movies don't really show that anyone in the ""movies'"" Matrix is reacting to the huge battles erupting in there cities street and the story seems to totally ignore them. They reach just the same as in the first movie. Did you every wonder Why?<br/><br/>That is because it is YOU ""the one(s)"" in the movie's audience that Neo is trying to reach. It is your mind that he is trying to free. If you are in the matrix right now, and you are, what better way to reach you copper top batteries than in the theaters and through the movie industry. At least you think about a movie and will discuss it or than you do any thing else.<br/><br/>
After all it is just a movie.<br/><br/>So if we are in the matrix right now ""What is the Matrix?""<br/><br/>The clue to the first half of the answer is: Study the Greeks - read the philosophy of Aristotle to learn his definition of the Hierarchical Cosmos, Teleological Politics, Teleological Ethic, the Philosophical Life. If life is meaningful? Does life have a purpose?<br/><br/>Notice the sign above the door in the Oracle's kitchen ""Tenet Nosce"". Tenet means any opinion, principle, doctrine, dogma, etc. esp. one held as true by members of a professional, group, or movement. Nosce te ipsum (Nosce) is Latin for ""know thyself""<br/><br/>

In Revolutions the highlight was ZION I wanted to see what would happen to zion and a lot happens.<br/><br/>THis is why I loved the movie because I did not care about Neo and Trinity their purpose was defined in the first movie thats why the second movie has much less of a thrill.<br/><br/>And yes the ending was cheesy and the Architecht is not really explained I gave it an 8 out 10"

","This movie has some incredible fight and chase scenes that you would expect... and some unexpected situations as well. It has humor and drama, and of course my favorite---the sci-fi story line. I look forward to seeing it many times over. Just don't expect a 'never done before' action/sci-fi, because in the end, it is a trilogy."

","The matrix revolutions was a good movie but too much was unnecessary.The war between the machines and zion was amazing but a little too long, the dialogue drawn out and boring, and the fights are too elaborate although they did take after Dragonball Z and other animes in their fight scenes. Other than that, I thought that it was better than reloaded but we can all admit that The first Matrix was the best by far."

","I think it's obvious a real fan of the Matrix would love this movie. I have read the few bad reviews that made any sense at all or would justify you not liking it. If you disliked it then it's too much for you and you need to see it again. For me I want to see this GREAT movie at least 5 more times. I think this one is just as good as the first one and a step better then Reloaded.<br/><br/>So some things in the movie, or alot of the things did go how you wanted it too or didn't make sense to you. Use your own thing you have that me and only some others on this board have - an imagination. Good for the directors to make it non predictable and leave it fuzzy.<br/><br/>The action in this movie was the best ever. The acting was top notch. Neo is the best good guy since Luke Skywalker and Agent Smith is the best bad guy since Darth Vader. I think looking back on all three of these movies the future, the horrific and desolate future makes you really think to a whole new level. It's visually stunning and yet so depressing that you almost feel sorry for the people. I think desperation has played a huge part in all these movies how they will do anything for survival and serenity.<br/><br/>
Ignore the silly negative reviews from the ignorant crowd and see this movie. It's one of the most enjoyable times I've had since the last one. I can't get enough of the Matrix."

","It appears as though the Wachowski Bros. would actually like to make another Matrix some day after all.  That is, if they want to answer some of the questions they brought of in this 'finale'.  I was informed that this final sequel was supposed to wrap it up.  In some ways, it did just that.<br/><br/> SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS<br/><br/> SURE, it looks like Morpheus and Niobi are finding their lost love.  Zee and the operator from Morpheus's team were reunited emotionally after much tense worry over whether they'd see each other again.  Young geek has become a man through war and fire.  AND the war, of course is over...  Or is it? And for how long?  I'll tell you how long!  Just as long as the machines decide 'it's over'.  At some point down the line, that shakey truce could unravel.  Naturally, not due to the machines changing their mind; i'm sure they don't change their mind or lie like we do.  BUT, what if the unstable humans decide to form some kind of attack?  Maybe they won't as long as they know the machines could wipe them out whenever they take a notion.  But is that REALLY freedom???  Not for me, but maybe for the W Bros. it's good enough.  And then there's The One.  Is he dead?  Well, could be, but the oracle says, 'oh i'm sure we'll see him again.'  Hmmm... what's this? Doesn't sound like the wrapping-up closure I was looking for in this film. Believe me, I don't mind if they want to make another film; but just don't leave me hanging as to whether they actually will or not.<br/><br/> NOT TO MENTION, my favorite character SPOILER of MAJOR PROPORTIONS: Trinity gets killed in this one.  I didn't like that.  NOW, if they had given any closure to this movie, I'd be fine with this.  But they didn't, it's STILL open and almost as much as at the end of Reloaded.  And way more open than at the end of the first Matrix.  To me, that's just not right. Say you'll make another one or close this up.<br/><br/> I ONLY say this because these three movies drew me into them.  I'm the hugest fan of these movies compared to anyone.  I think as a trilogy (omitting the ending to this one) They ARE THE best movies I have ever seen. I don't mind that this one ended with such an obvious openning for more at it's conclusion, just DON'T SAY THERE's no more!!!  Make more or wrap it up, that's all i'm saying.<br/><br/> I'm only extremely fearful that the Brothers created a bolder to heavy for them to lift.  I could see how making the spectrum of this drama an overwhelming task to conclude once and for all, but that's why they get paid so much, isn't it?  I mean, with the money they'll walk away from after all the dust clears, you'd think they could have made the ending a bit contained that the one they did.  IN FACT:  MY ONLY ONLY complaint (other than SPOILER the demise of Trinity (and Neo, too; to me THEY are The One, not just Neo.) Trinity's love for him; i think, gave him his power -if you remember from the first one) is the ending.  I couldn't have dreamed of a movie that made me love them more than this trilogy.  But the ending left me with a sick feeling in my stomach.  But ONLY because I fear there will be no more movies.  HONEST.<br/><br/> Oh yeah; and one more FEAR.  What if they make this into a TV show.  Fine. But what if it bombs?  It would most likely be cut off with no more closure. That's what i'm saying!!!<br/><br/> SPOILERS ARE DONE!!!<br/><br/> All in all, I loved these films.  No offense Keanu, but if any director can make your performances so believable and real, they deserve all the money they get!  Not really, however, Mr. Reeves did a WoNDERFUL job in his character.  AND CARRIE ANN MOSS was tough, enchanting, and just plain cool. Excellent work there for both.  There are just too many names to go on with, but Fishburne was awesome too.  I like any movie he's in, so there wasn't much surprise there that I like him yet again.  All the acting was top-notch.<br/><br/> The special effects:  well, I'd need a WHOLE other sections to send in if I wrote about them, except that they were the BEST I've ever seen.  AND to those 'poo-pooers' that keep griping about CGI.  All I have to say is, get used to it; it's here to stay.  And to me that's a good thing.  I think it's just as good as the clay models or other tactics of old.  In some cases, even better.  I'd watch the movie right now, despite it's ending, just to see the attack on Zion by the sentinel, snake thing.<br/><br/> I gave this movie 8/10.  I wanted to give 10/10 and WILL if they make another movie.  But I can see me watching the first ones again and feeling bad, knowing that the end won't satisfy me."

","First thing first. I never rely on others reviews and expect the same from others. Everyone has different taste so before judging the movie from other reviews better watch it by yourself. No doubt as all the hues and cries were evident also 2nd one was horrible still there were some guys who loved that movie. No wonder same thing is bound to happen for this part too. But after reading millions of reviews and after contemplating one million times I decided to take a bold step and bouight the ticket:-P..  but to my surprise this movie rocks. I'd say this is as good as the first one was. but since first one was totally unexpected and the idea and everything was introduced in that so no one can replace first one.<br/><br/>Overall don't expect anything and then go for the movie with totally free mind. and you will really enjoy the show. not much fighting is here but it's enough. More of story wrapping thing and thought provoking stuff.<br/><br/>Well still I have few questions unanswered but who cares as long as I enjoyed the show. Even Wachovski brothers are not super duper intelligent so I never expected that they will answer all the questions. they tried and they succeeded. 3 cheers for them and for those who really enjoyed the movie. Others please don't give your bad review to this part. If you don't like the movie it's better to don't say anything about it.<br/><br/> and I'd advice once again dont rely on other's reviews. Make your Own.<br/><br/> have fun..."

","Why is there no one we care about in this film?  Why are Neo, Trinity and Morpheus hardly in it?  Isn't it these characters who we have followed/ loved from the start?  Instead we get some unknowns who we have nothing invested in.  We just don't care about them, or whether Zion falls or not. The dialogue is laughable.<br/><br/>The third film may have wanted a different look to what we normally expect from The Matrix.  But why did they make it look like every other sci fi film of recent years.  Instead of pushing things forward, we get a mixture of past favourites like Alien, Star Wars, Terminator and Robocop.<br/><br/>As has already been mentioned in previous posts, the simultaneous worldwide release with hardly any press was designed to get as much money in as possible for a film everyone knew would be poor.  I struggled to stay awake for most of it.  When the final fight finally got going, I'd been uninterested for too long to get excited about it.  Some irrelevant character says at the end that 'it doesn't make sense'.  Best line of the film for me.<br/><br/>The one and only good thing about this film is Monica Belluci, and she's in it for about two minutes.  They should have stopped with the Matrix and retained their reputations as ground-breaking film makers.  I enjoyed the trailer for the Lord of the Rings better."

","Did anyone ever see the Twillight Zone episode where Elliot Gould was a restaurant reviewer that wrote his reviews before going to the restaurant? That's what it seems like a lot of the critics have done with Matrix:Revolutions. It was as if the all knew what they were going to say in advance. Well, I'm no Oracle, but I have to tell you, the critics are damn wrong on this one. Revolutions is a complex, clever, and thought provoking film. It's certainly not nuclear science or anything, but I haven't read a single review that has even tried to make sense of the riddles posed and explored by the film. It really is like a wonderful puzzle and ends up echoing similar themes that have been posed by recent Japanese films like Princess Monoke and Final Fantasy Spirits Within about violence and war (as opposed to the Hollywood WWII formula of Us Vs. Them). But perhaps the movie critics, having been in an intellectual stupor due to over exposure of most Hollywood fare (Matrix:Revolutions deconstructs Schwarzenegger and perhaps reveals why no one's interested in seeing Ahnold's movies anymore), just can't approach the ideas in it and can only seem to respond to whether or not the action and special effects of the film are good (they seem to look for the visuals as evidence that Matrix:Revolutions has nothing to offer, dismissing the most delectable parts of the film as ""pseudo-philosophy gobbligook""). I'm sure if Revolutions were a French film, critics would be singing its praises. And that's too bad because it only means that some moviegoers will avoid this movie because of the negative reviews and instead spend their money on insipid fare like ""Elf"" or ""Master and Commander""."

","My title says it all. The movie wasn't just a disappointment it was horrid. I loved the first one, liked the second, and wished when I saw the last one I never seen any of them. The movie made absolutely NO SENSE. There was no plot holes, as another person pointed out, because there was no PLOT!<br/><br/>The one and only redeeming aspect of this movie is watching the secondary cast members fight the invasion of the squids. The main characters contribute nothing to this movie. Had they just named this movie, ""Attack of Robotic Squids"" and shown only that part of the movie I would have been thrilled with that action eye candy. Don't watch this movie if you are looking for answers to these questions...<br/><br/>Will humans win the war of CONTROL? (answer is no but the movie says the war is over. Strange that Morpheus told Neo in the first movie that this was a war of control. Where machines now control humans with the matrix to turn them into batteries. To which he uses a durecell to emphasis his point.)<br/><br/>What is the true meaning behind the Neo, Oracle, Seraph, Merovingian, or the Architect? (you will never find out because nothing about who they really are or where they get there powers/motivation or anything that would make this movie interesting is explained. In fact, the only explanation we get is when Neo is asking these very questions himself on screen to the oracle and she responds, ""You will know when you want to know."" Or some stupid crap line like that)<br/><br/>This movie has barely any redeeming value whatso ever."

","I saw this movie for the 2nd time today, and I have to say that now that I have, I like it even more.<br/><br/>This is one movie that really HAS to be seen twice to really be appreciated. There were so very many subtlties that whiz by so quickly, and upon subsequent viewing (where I was able to absorb them), enhanced greatly my overall enjoyment and appreciation of this movie.<br/><br/>I think that you are meant to be left with questions and almost required to use a certain amount of interpretation of some things about it.  But I found that some of the larger issues that I thought were addressed a bit vaguely during the first viewing, I found were given their due, but your really had to be watching for it.  This time I did just that, and I understand enough of what I saw to believe this to be a fitting end to the trilogy.<br/><br/>I have read a lot of user comments that basically stated that they were not sure what to make of it when they walked out of the theater, but after pondering it for a bit, came to a point where they fel they better understood it.  I never questioned that I enjoyed it, but I too needed time to absorb the deeper aspects.  So, I let a few days go by, and went to see it again.<br/><br/>My advice to all, and especially those who hated it because they did not get the ending, would be to give it one more chance and see it again.  I think you will find something you might have missed the first time, and your perceptions of this film will no doubt improve as well.<br/><br/>

"ilovedolby","8","2","4","12 November 2003"," A good ending to a hyper-cool trilogy.
","It's been four years since we first saw `The Matrix,' and few could have predicted the immense success that it would become. Two sequels later, we finally see how it all ends in `The Matrix Revolutions.' One thing to be expected with this film is it is action-oriented. For those out there who love the semi-deep philosophy involved, never fear, it is still here-just downplayed. We basically know everything, after `The Matrix Reloaded.' We know that Neo is the one.' We know that instead of ending the war, he chose to save Trinity's life and fight another day. But exactly HOW was it going to end? You'll have to find out for yourself. 	`The Matrix Revolutions' picks up exactly where `Reloaded' left off-Neo appears to be a coma. In fact, he is trapped in a place between the real world and the computer world and he is being held there by the Merovingian. Morpheus and Trinity take it upon themselves to make a deal with the Merovingian to set him free. 	When freed, Neo visits the Oracle one last time. However, her appearance has changed in order to hide her identity-after all, she is a program and can be changed (Gloria Foster who played the original Oracle died before `Reloaded' was completed. Mary Alice plays the new oracle). She reminds Neo that he still has to face Agent Smith one last time in order to completely end the war. As such, they are now off and trying to find a way to help the underground city of Zion fight off the machine army burrowing towards them.<br/><br/>When a strategy is formulated, Neo and Trinity decide to take a ship, alone. Neo knows that in order to end things once and for all, he'll have to go Machine City, where humans are grown, and face the leader of the machines. He believes this confrontation will be the key to ending the war between humans and machines. The philosophy that once seemed so deep is still in `Revolutions,' just in a minor way, compared to the last films. The Oracle reminds Neo that in order to defeat Agent Smith, Neo has to understand that he and Smith are practically the same person-they just have different personalities. Only when Neo can comprehend Smith's intentions, can he ever hope to beat him. Metaphorically, Smith is compared to Neo's evil twin. Also, I found it amusing how in the one scene where we see the elusive Architect of the matrix, he explains to the Oracle the outcome of world if the matrix comes to an end. When the Oracle questions the Architect if what he's saying is true, his response is, `What do you think I am, human?' Naturally, in his world, machines do not know how to lie. `The Matrix Revolutions' is an action flick-and what a great one at that! The visual effects are as astonishing as one would expect from the series. However, unlike `Reloaded,' `Revolutions' sequences do not drag on for long periods of time. In `Reloaded,' many of the scenes seemed be never-ending as if to show-off the filmmaker's great visual technique of Bullet-time. In actuality, it was overkill for the film making it run longer than necessary. In `Revolutions,' we get the right amount of action combined with those amazing Bullet-time shots. As such, it's every bit as impressive now as it was in the first two films. Overall, `The Matrix Revolutions' is a good ending to a hyper-cool trilogy. ***"
"Mulliga","8","2","4","8 November 2003"," So much more than I expected... (spoilers)
","I loved ""The Matrix."" I even liked ""Reloaded,"" though the flaws of the Wachowski brothers' filmmaking were becoming more apparent. I thought ""Reloaded"" took a lot of courage to make, and I liked the new direction for the series, since it made the conclusion that much harder to predict. Less appealing to me (and everyone else it seems) were the Zion rave and the CGI parts of the Burly Brawl.<br/><br/>I then heard lots and lots of negative reviews for ""Revolutions."" And I mean EVERYWHERE - in newspapers, on the net, and on IMDB. I was scared - had the Wachowskis finally failed? I went in with just a single hope: please be decent...please be decent...<br/><br/>These thoughts were dispelled fairly early on. In Mobil Ave., Neo has a classic Matrix moment: he runs into a tunnel, and, like Pac-Man, he comes out through the other side of the screen - the tunnel wraps around itself like a mobius strip. It's a nice comic touch, and put me at ease for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The coat check fight at Club Hel was a bit of a let-down (very derivative of the lobby shootout, unfortunately), but the Mexican standoff with Mero's goons made up for it. ""I'll kill everybody in this room to get Neo back,"" Trinity says, and Carrie-Anne Moss makes us believe it.<br/><br/>The real-world action with Trinity, Bane/Smith, and Neo was pretty good, though I can't believe it took Neo THAT long to figure out Bane was Smith (maybe he was buying Trin time :P). It's nice to see that the people in the ""real world"" retain all their kung-fu skills and such.<br/><br/>Even the minor characters (like Mifune, the Kid, and Zee) received plenty of characterization. The ""Battle of Zion,"" which I was concerned felt too fake in the trailers, came off beautifully. The whole desperation of it, the overwhleming feeling of inevitability - it was classic stuff. The streams of sentinels, the blaze of APU fire, the low-tech manner of resupply (""Reload!"")...exciting and well done.<br/><br/>The final ""Dragonball Z""-style fight was AMAZING. The water-sphere effect (especially the water falling down afterwards) was beautiful and impressive. Neo and Smith fly through the air in a ballet of kung-fu, and Neo actually loses(!). How many big-name sci-fi trilogies end with the main character biting the dust to save the world?<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was a fitting and respectable end to a great trilogy. It's certainly flawed, but nothing too critical has been screwed up, and the parts that are good are great indeed. There is even more religious symbolism and philosophy, and the Wachowskis allow the speculation to continue (Is it MWAM? Is Neo _really_ dead? Where did his powers come from, anyway? Will the peace last?) without copping out and forcing an explanation on us.<br/><br/>For the true believer in all of us...<br/><br/>8/10"

The original matrix was great due to its innovation and stunning action sequences, but neither were present in this movie. You could write a book on how much has been stolen from Aliens / Blade Runner / Terminator and Star Wars!<br/><br/>The strongest characters were relegated to bit part characters (smith and morpheus) and replaced by paper thin cut-outs nicked straight from the corridors of hollywood cheese (see Armageddon, Pearl Harbour, Independence Day). There were so many pointless and ill-thought relationships such as the captain and the skinhead wannabe soldier, Link and his girlfriend, morpheus and his love interest??!!!<br/><br/>there was nothing but CGI in this movie, and there was nothing original or stylistically exciting.<br/><br/>the only thing missing from this movie was keanu (i'm so deep and meaningful) driving an american flag through agent smith at the end!<br/><br/>this lasts 2 hours, in which time you could absorb something a lot more meaningful like Voltaire's Candide, Camus's Outsider or Sartre's Nausea.

********************SPOILER************ By Neo choosing to keep fighting Smith, Neo gave Smith purpose.  By letting Smith achieve his goal, Neo wins.  No one ever said that the humans would beat the machines just that the war would end.  In the end, Neo becomes a part of the Matrix.

For starters, Trinity's black leather outfit is replaced with a baggy sweater full of holes when she is not plugged in. Very aesthetically displeasing. But the fact is that the Matrix world is much more interesting and exciting than the real, gray, drab world of Zion and Machine City. The Matrix world lets Neo show off his God- like kung fu skills. The real world is ugly, drab and boring. Even with all of the killer robots pouring into Zion, I was still yawning.  It wasn't a good trade off.<br/><br/>""Revolutions"" had a lot of special effects and robot war scenes but it lost touch with what makes the Matrix cool in the first place: The ability to manipulate reality in the Matrix world to your a** kicking advantage.<br/><br/>Although I liked ""Revolutions"" a little more than ""Reloaded"", it's clear that the Matrix franchise peaked with the first movie.

"lotus_chief","9","2","4","11 November 2003"," DON'T BELIEVE THE 'HATE'!!!
","***SPOILERS INCLUDED!!*** When I came onto IMDb to see how its members rated Matrix Revoutions, I was shocked. 6.6/10? Could a franchise so promising fall by the wayside so quickly? Then I read some external reviews. Many other critics were bashing it as well. After seeing it a couple days ago, now that it all sunk in, all I have to say is 'Don't Believe The Hate!!!' <br/><br/>The Matrix trilogy will be forever tainted, because it was ahead of its time. The masses weren't ready. When the original was released in 1999, it was a sleeper hit; a new phenomenon was born, new grounds were broken in film. It was the perfect combination of astounding visuals and an intellectually challenging story. Matrix Reloaded was ""The Matrix times 2"". More characters, more story, more action, more questions. Quite frankly, it went over many people's heads. It took too much brain power for the masses. The problem with people is that they can't look at things objectively. Once Reloaded was  released, everyone had an opinion as to what happened, and what was going to happen. That's okay, that was why it was left open, to anticipate how it will end. But as ignorant and foolish as people are, they took themselves too seriously and thought that their opinion was SUPPOSED to happen. So when Revolutions finally came, if the story didn't go or end the way they thought it would, or the way they thought it SHOULD end, they were quick to bash the film. WHAT IGNORANCE! Is this YOUR story? NO! Did anyone really expect the other 2 films to be as 'fresh' as the original? Everyone loves the original because, more than anything else, it was new and fresh. There's NO WAY that feeling could ever be duplicated....GET OFF IT!! Now onto Revolutions....<br/><br/>
This trilogy couldn't have ended any other way, and it was done very well. Sure there was some corny dialogue, but all 3 films have corny dialogue. People forget that there wasn't much action in the original; Reloaded and Revolutions have much more. I've heard people complain about the lack of characters in Revolutions as compared to Reloaded....uh those characters are all based in the MATRIX....this film is about ZION, hence you won't see them much, if at all. People say 'they didn't explain 'Persephone's kiss'. What about it? She kissed everyone, including Niobe and Ghost....so what? Since when was that an integral part to the story? The story in this is just as good as in the other two. The visual effects are simply AMAZING; the Zion battle will go down in history as one of the most amazing achievements EVER in film. I think they've topped themselves with each film. Sure, there's questions still not answered/to be asked, but for God's sake, use your brain a little! Go watch something like that so-called remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Scary Movie 3 if you want everything handed to you like babies. The action also was on the same level as the last two if not better; its definitely better than the original. The acting was better, Keanu Reeves was very good, Laurence Fishburne came back to form and Hugo Weaving again steals the show. I'm sure many people were fooled by how the original caught on like wildfire. After seeing the complete story, and seeing the response, its even more apparent that The Matrix trilogy is NOT FOR EVERYONE! If you didn't like it, then it wasn't for you. But don't just hate on it because of your thoughts on how the story should've gone; that's not fair and is very ignorant. The Wachowski brothers are telling the story, remember? This is the best trilogy of our time definitely. Lord of the Rings? PLEASE! I laugh at the ludicrous thought! I thank the Wachowski's for giving us their vision, it was a GREAT ride. <br/><br/>*** out of **** stars. <br/><br/>P.S. PLEASE end the trilogy here! It's fine just how it is! Don't do a 4th film!

"stabo","7","2","4","11 November 2003"," Matrix Revolutions  The Choice is yours.
","I'll just start by saying that to make an effective and fair review of a movie/story one has to do a little research. I've noticed that people are complaining about certain aspects of the story in their reviews, particularly the place of secondary characters such as `The Kid'<br/><br/>
These can be explained with a little research, I urge everyone to see the Annimatrix, preferably before seeing Reloaded or Revolutions as it help explains a lot. Sure some of the characters may seem a little cliché, but having a bit extra background knowledge of the story will help alleviate this. <br/><br/>Having said all that, revolutions was better than I expected, I would place it between the original and Reloaded which was somewhat of a disappointment. There is a good mix of story and action, and you never know where the ride is going to take you. Some of the fighting between Smith and Neo is slightly tiresome as we all know it was never going to end with a fistfight. The battle for Zion is nothing short of spectacular, there was obviously a lot of effort and thought put into it. <br/><br/>This movie can be enjoyed by the fans of the matrix story and scifi fans in general. Again it is a matter of choice, you can either focus on negative aspects (of which there are a few) or you can focus on the positive ones."

But most of Revolutions I found riveting and almost beautiful, especially the ending.<br/><br/>Last point, albeit a personal one: I saw this movie during a weekend getaway in Vegas with some friends, and the deeper universal themes of the film will be what I remember most about the trip.  8/10."

"zubuallstar","Null","2","4","6 November 2003"," WHY THE MATRIX IS BRILLIANT
","In response to bad reviews of Matrix Revolutions film, I try and shed some light on its significance.  Despite practically every critic slamming it, I want to give you my perspective.  It does not give you all the truths to the film, but hopefully you will have a much higher appreciation for it.  I warn readers, DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE SPOILED.<br/><br/>From day one, the Matrix saga has kept up a theme that lived within the character's actions and names.  I am not talking about simple representations of names, but on a much deeper level how they react because of those names.  The first Matrix film opened up our eyes to another world and reality, and did it simply, and therefore it was good.  Yet, I ask you, does the finest poetry or best piece of art have to completely explain itself.  Of course not.  But, unfortunately critics are not ready for a film of this poetic magnitude.<br/><br/>Reloaded and Revolutions gradually unveil the machine's true intentions and motivations through very, and I mean very, subtle cues.  Whether or not you'll be astonished by this truth, I am not sure, but the Matrix IS completely fueled by religious beliefs, which in turn give the human race hope and PURPOSE.  I am not talking about praying at mass here, I'm talking about everything we know about Greek mythology or Christianity lives and breaths in the Matrix, and was created by machines.  Why you may ask?  How else could they control an entire species of intellectuals who do not have a purpose or hope in enslavement.  How about the ones that specifically reject the matrix?  Will more and more keep rejecting it?  No, religion is made by the machines to keep humans in their slumber.  Yet, this is not necessarily a malicious intent.  If you watched the animatrix prequel you would understand the unusual sympathy that the machines give human despite their cruelties.  It is a war going on, BUT the machines keep the humans in their tubes until it is proven that peace is possible.  Machines are the logical creatures in the world, they do what they need to survive based on equations, and they are waiting for the time that they can once again co-exist with humanity without having it as a mathematical threat.  That's where NEO comes in.  Neo is obviously a Christ/ Jesus/ messiah character. Yet it is ironic that he is most likely less human than everyone else. Neo, meaning one, has no family whatsoever, he constantly questions as illustrated though Neo asking `why' every 5 seconds in all 3 films.  Neo is most likely 'grown' or constructed by the machines.  Whoa.  Too much to handle?  Let me give you some more background material before I go on.<br/><br/>First of all, let's clear some names.  Merovingian is closely linked to Hades.  In fact he is Hades, and his wife as the tale suggests is Persephone, Monica Belluci.  He controls the passage between worlds.  The train man controls purgatory.  Seraph, the Oracle's protector, is defined as the highest level of angel.  What does he do in the movie?  He's essential a guardian angel that protects.  Now, the biggest truth. what is the Oracle? The oracle is the human god, in fact the New Testament God.  It is a program made by the machines with a lot of power to give us hope.  GOD must therefore have a human sentiment; unlike the Architect who represents the Old Testament God (the two are obviously very different in the movie and Bible).  Yet, the Oracle like the Christian New Testament God knows everything and is all-powerful, but can not control free will.  That is why she can not decide what CHOICES people will make, especially Neo.  Neo is the most interesting of them all.  Like Jesus who was made in our image but given God's power.  Neo is made in our image with god-like (the supreme god of everything is the machine god - face at end of film) machine powers. When Neo chooses to not make the LOGICAL, mathematical choice of choosing to save the human race, but rather picks the other door to save trinity, he does it for emotion; something a machine is not supposed to understand. Granted I can not argue that neo is a machine, but it's possible.  It's possible that he is super-genetically created by the machines. Nevertheless, the machines somehow give Neo his powers.  Likewise, Agent Smith is created like Jesus (through Death) but is his negative, or the anti-Christ, the being that will bring judgment day with it to destroy everyone (takes over everyone's body)<br/><br/>As Neo starts to understand what he has to do in Purgatory, the train station, he can finally make the jump from hell (Zion) to heaven (machine city).  This stuff is highly Dante symbolized.  As Neo goes to the machine city, or Paradiso, he can not bring Trinity and he has to be blind.  Dante was blinded by the lights (think about all the lights that Neo saw) and could not face God, sorry it had to be a machine people. but it is.  Also for your information, Morpheus most likely symbolizes Virgil in Dante, because he can bring people back and forth through the worlds but not to heaven and he is the guide.  Neo then sacrifices himself, just like Jesus did, so that peace can be restored, and the gates (of heaven) could be opened.  The machines accept the peace because Neo gave away everything for the love of the human race, including himself.  If he is somehow machine, it is more powerful that he has learned to love his enemy (TRINITY) and proves that humans are now ready for peace.  Therefore the architect says at the end of the film that whoever wants to go will be able to, meaning that the Neo has finally opened the gates even if it is more of a figurative sense. The other 5-6 neo's did not accomplish this task.  They could not sacrifice themselves for emotion.  They did not understand love and they would not give up everything to make change, just as Jesus did.<br/><br/>If you do not trust my convictions, research for yourself the Judgment day in the bible.  Research Dante's inferno, purgatorio and paradise.  Then look up and research each of the character's names and how that relates to the movie.  You will find yourself very surprised that everything seems to line up.  Obviously there are many more questions to answer, and I do not have them.  I find it completely fascinating that Wachowski brothers have created a modern Dante tale without anyone knowing it.  I think most people were not ready to accept that religion is both artificial and real in this film world, and that even though religion might be fake in the matrix world it still does its purpose even in the real world.  I find it absolutely fascinating that the Wachowski brothers have taken everything we visualize about the afterlife, and made it into a sci-fi universe, where heaven is actually a machine world and hell is a multi-leveled human city under ground.  These ideas are all just as profound as the first matrix, but they did not shove it into our face and give us definite answers.  The Wachowki brothers, on the other hand, had the ability because of their freedom (made so much money) that they could make art and not worry what the critics would say.  I apologize that this is a winded and more of some kind of Emersonian train of thought explanation, but hopefully this will help people change their minds about it.  Time will tell if the Matrix Revolutions is as profound as I believe it to be."
"astoffregen","10","2","4","7 November 2003"," Great Movie, great Trilogy! Fully satisfied!
","Hello World, I feel the urgent need to defend the Trilogy against unjustified attacks from all sides.<br/><br/>It is a great trilogy that has deep philosophical implications and is greatly thought provoking. I kept discussing the movies for a long time and I urge everyone not to look only on the surface, but look deeper.<br/><br/>There are many themes that are worth pondering about and I think the Wachowski Bros did a great job in finding a perfect ending. What did you expect? An ending where everything is explained even to the clueless viewer? Where Trinity and Neo are holding hands, the sky is blue again and all humans cheer upon their new King and Queen? You didn't really believe the story of human batteries?<br/><br/>Come on!<br/><br/>There is no spoon. Not in the Matrix, not even in the ""reality"" of Zion, which is another instance of another Matrix. As Morpheus so eloquently put it: ""Is this real?""<br/><br/>But the movie leaves you with many questions and hints about the nature of reality (is there a Matrix within a Matrix (Green Matrix/Orange Matrix)?), Buddism and Gnostic Philosophy, the relationship of the Architect/Oracle, the choice of free will, reincarnation etc.<br/><br/>Adding to that I witnessed the most stunning visual effects I have seen in my life.<br/><br/>So please give the movie a chance and understand it as a surreal parable about many unanswered questions in life, and not as the average Hollywood airhead movie.<br/><br/>10 out of 10!!!"
"M&J","8","2","4","9 November 2003"," I liked it. (Don't shoot me for doing so)
","Wow, I read a lot of the comments and was surprised by the amount of people who thought this movie sucked. I for one liked it.  Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) was amazing again. He's such a dynamic and captivating actor. All of the Matrix films have showcased his talent as an engaging villain. If anything, I think he's wasted on Lord of the Rings. <br/><br/>I was riveted to my seat during the battle sequences. I felt for the characters fighting an impossible fight and the visual affects only enhanced those feelings. I didn't mind the philosophical dialog in any of the films, including this one.  People who showed up for the action seem to be particularly irritated by all the chatter.  True, the W Brothers are no Shakespeare or Cohen Brothers for that matter. The dialog *could* have been better, but I've seen a lot worse in many other films. I'd say that this Matrix is better than the second Matrix but I have to agree with most that this film can't hold a candle to the first Matrix.<br/><br/>I think the thing that hurt the W Bros was their reliance on their video game and the Animatrix for providing a lot of back-story missing from the second and third film. I can see why some people who didn't rent the anime and the game would get confused about what happened to the Oracle, why that kid keeps following Neo around, etc. They took a gamble and judging from all the people stating they were confused, I don't think it paid off the way they were expecting.<br/><br/>I've bought the second Matrix on DVD and watched it a few times now and as a result, I've caught a lot of things that I've missed. This Matrix, I have no doubt, will have a similar affect on me when I buy it on DVD. The W Bros should take this as a sign that they need to learn a better way to explain their epic stories to an American viewing audience that needs it handed to them on a platter with a note and lit sparklers sticking out of it. The movie is surprisingly deep, full of amazing visuals, and nearly wraps up all the lose ends but not all of them. Why not? Judging from the past, the W Brothers may continue the Matrix story in other mediums like comic books, games, or even more anime. I don't think they're done yet, and perhaps that is why some people didn't like this movie. It's not a completely open and shut book.  It's an ending with question marks that only some people can see, depending on how aware of the matrix they have become :-)<br/><br/>Overall, I give the film a B+"
"ACMcC24","9","2","4","9 November 2003"," Confused for a while, but definitely not disappointed.
","For the people complaining that ""The Matrix Reloaded"" had no story, they should be content with ""Revolutions"".  With the story line divided between Zion's war against the Sentinels and Neo's/Trinity's journey to machine city, your are far from bored or disappointed.  With exception of the ""Rings Trilogy"", I can't think of any special effects driven war as tremendous as the war with Zion.  The smart thing the Wachowski brothers did was play out each story arch in it's entirety before moving to the next, so when you witness the war with Zion there are no interruptions, with the same going for Neo's journey.       It's impossible to say that one of the Matrix movies is better than the other two.  Once you finish the trilogy, you find that you need all three movies to piece together the whole story, including the Animatix.  It was also nice to see each character change through each movie, moving in stages toward the kind of people they needed to be in the end to make the decisions they made.  If I had any criticism, it would be that the ending didn't seem complete, falling flat after an extremely tense 1.5 - 2 hours worth of wildness.  Other than this, it was a movie worth waiting for.  Needless to say, I'm more than happy with it."

","Revolutions was so boring, I took out my checkbook and began to deduct my debits from my current balance using my pocket flashlight to see--but somehow this terrible film kept distracting my work with such amazingly bad dialogue and pointless fight sequences (Merv's club? 10 minutes of wasted time; the train station? none of this advanced the story at all) that I forgot to carry the one, twice.  How can I get my account in order when these characters keep talking about whether they believe Neo will succeed at whatever it is Neo is supposed to do that no one knows what it is including Neo??  So they talk and talk and no one wonders why there are no EMPs in Zion until a ship returns, and no one wonders how they're going to have enough ammunition to defeat the sentinels when it takes someone with a mortar and pestle 2-3 minutes to make one shell.  Wow, now I need to transfer money from savings to cover that last check.  I almost didn't catch that because it got really dark on screen with lots of rain and lots of Smith's; I hope Neo didn't get hurt because he needs to succeed at something or other, because so many people believe.  Oh, forgot to deduct the atm charge..."
"bigfella2k1","8","2","4","9 November 2003"," Great story, but Keanu still can't act
","Well,the trilogy is finally over- and although some people have been griping about the somewhat vague ending, I can't think of any other way that would have brought a satisfying resolution to the story- which is left wide open for a sequel in the future (although they should really just stop here.)<br/><br/>What I liked: The Zion Attack scenes were amazing, there's no padding in the first half hour like in Reloaded,unexpected character deaths,<br/><br/>the final Agent Smith battle put the Burly Brawl to shame, and the whole train station scene was touching and well thought out.<br/><br/>What I didn't like: Keanu still can't act, Morpheus and Persephone had nothing to do, the confrontation scene with Bane was ridiculously stretched out.<br/><br/>This was far more satisfying than the last installment, although everyone should really watch all 3 movies in a row before they start griping about it. The philosophy elements were toned down as well, but still intriguing (The Merovingian's ""cause and effect"" view, versus Neo's ""free will/choice"" view.) <br/><br/>My Score: 8/10"
"bluzman","8","2","4","9 November 2003"," Lotsa Action -- Computer Effects Keep Getting Stronger
","If for no other reason, this movie series has been of major importance in the way it created, expanded and pushed forward the computerized special effects business.  There is still a long way to go.  Computer generated armies like in LOTR or the Mummy, for example, cannot match the human ones of movies like Hero -- at least yet. Recently, a university professor networked approx. 2000 new Macintosh computer with newly developed software that essentially created one computer matching the capabilities of a many times more expensive supercomputer. If someone in Hollywood grabs this technology, hold onto your lugnuts, Emma.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie, as I did the others.  Lots of action and effects.  The premise is good and makes for a good story. Without getting into spoiler, I will just say the ending disappointed me because of the unfilled holes/questions.  They are the kind that create sequels, just the kind that qualify as loose ends.<br/><br/>Overall, I think most Sci-fi lovers will enjoy this movie a lot.  Critics will hate it, cuz that is what critics do.  They look at movies totally different than humans.  Then they proceed to validate their existence by either trashing it, because it is trendy and makes them look real smart, or the coo and gurgle platitudes of praise, like they did for that dreadfully boring, predictable Gladiator movie to maintain their welcome status in the clique of self-congratulations.<br/><br/>I think the Matrix trilogy is going to set well in Sci-fi/Fantasy history with other multi-movie sets like LOTR, Star Wars, Star Trek.  I am anxious to see the eventually special boxed set of all 3 with whatever special additions will surely be included."
"cshark","8","2","4","8 November 2003"," Jaw-Dropping Conclusion....
","Plain and simple... I loved it. <br/><br/>Certainly not as much as The Matrix, but far more than The Matrix Reloaded. Most, if not all of my story questions were answered. The Battle of Zion is a masterpiece and the final duel between Smith and Neo was terrific. Well made, paced, filmed, and acted. A fitting conclusion that I will certainly watch many more times....8/10."
"jnkline","9","2","4","8 November 2003"," Come on folks--meet them half way!
","It should go without saying that viewers are drawn to (and repelled from) the Matrix movies for a combination of reasons: special effects, action, theme, story, philosophy, soundtrack, cast, etc.  <br/><br/>In important ways, both Reloaded and Revolutions contribute to a great trilogy.  Each movie raises bold questions that have preoccupied philosophers--classical and contemporary--and that deserve a place in our present consideration.  <br/><br/>It seems to me that a key component to an appreciation of this trilogy is a modest exercise in suspending one's disbelief.  The campy dialogue, cheesy love scenes, and over-the-top epic battles can be stumbling blocks if one insists on staying rooted in skepticism--if one insists that the movie-makers come to him/her, rather than offering to meet them half-way. The elements just listed are also found throughout the world's best classic literature: The Epic of Gilgamesh, The Illiad & Oddyssy, The Bible, Paradise Lost, etc.  <br/><br/>We all can think of ways we think the movies could be better.  No one will argue that a movie production team who places special effects at the top of its list is going to fall short in other crucial areas (character & plot development).  It reads as if most imdb.com members had unwarranted expectations of the sequels in the trilogy, and communicated their disappointment through their votes.  Unfortunately, this distorts these movies merit.  Currently, Reloaded has an IMDB average of 7.3 and Revolutions 6.7--compared to The Matrix at 8.5.  It is my belief that a fairer, more reflective audience would rate these movies much more closely. My judgment, for what it's worth--in order of their release 10-9-9.  I express my gratitude to  the hordes of artists and laborers who were involved in the awesome task."
"bizbozz","10","2","4","5 November 2003"," Great, but can't live up to its billing
","I will not spoil the movie for anyone, but Revolutions comes close but doesn't strike the iron.  What was billed as the third most anticipated movie of the year (after Reloaded and Return of the King) was a letdown for what I was expecting.  But let me make it clear that rarely ever does a movie so hyped live up to its billing, so while I was disappointed, Revolutions does indeed plunge down the rabbit hole.<br/><br/>Revolutions started slow, I rode the edge of my seat waiting for the action and the plot to pick up, think the time spent at Zion during Reloaded for a more accurate description, boring and slow to point.  It wasn't until about an hour in that it really started to get interesting, and even then it spiked up and down until the war really began.  With the two main point lines, Neo and the war on Zion rarely crisscrossing, I found myself wondering what happened to Neo during the 30 minute Zion sequence.<br/><br/>However, let me make it known that Revolutions is quite a good film. Unlike Reloaded, you can't as easily pick out the digitally animated scenes. And compared to Reloaded, you're not scratching your head quite as often. More than once during the war on Zion you find yourself thinking if you were right there, and the realism is fantastic.<br/><br/>Overall, I rated Revolutions a 7/10.  But make this clear, do not wait for the DVD, see this movie as quickly as possible.  This is one of four trilogies that should only be seen in theaters, following Indiana Jones, Star Wars IV, V, VI as well as I, II, and upcoming III, and finally Lord of the Rings.  Slight tip, watch the Animatrix shorts that prelude the Matrix, then the rest of the Animatrix, then Reloaded, then go see Revolutions, that will not disappoint."

I didn't like it. I'm a fan of tight, muscular scripts. Scripts that make sense. Scripts that actually help you find the answers to the questions raised in the script. I read a review that claimed that the film was like any good religion, in that the answers aren't readily available. WHAT IN THE BLUE BABY JESUS HELL???? It's a goddamned movie!!! It's not Christianity, it's not Daoism, it's not Buddhism. It's a MOVIE. Neo has gone from being ""The One"" to being an annoyance in the Matrix. Wasn't the point of the Original Matrix that he had learned control over the computer program. In effect, that he could do what he wished? Why didn't he just take over Agent Smith and kick his programmed ass from here to Cleveland? I was disappointed by Matrix: Reloaded because there was fight scenes with no rhyme or reason, that it was basically the Warchowski Bros given so much budget they had to figure out what to do with it. Yes, the action sequences are good. but as stated in the past, ANYONE can have good action these days. You gotta have a solid story to hook it into. A story, for example, like Die Hard. That is a muscular script. THere's no wasted space. After the original, Matrix movies did nothing but meander.<br/><br/>Why can Neo affect machines in the real world? Why can Neo see after being blinded? HOw did Agent Smith overwrite a human being's consciousness? What the hell was Agent Smith's Point in existence? What was the Architect doing? What was the Oracle doing? So the Merovingian controls old programs. but what purpose does he serve? And to that point, what the hell happened to the Ghost Twins? What the hell did they do? Why weren't *THEY* the f****ng agents?? Morpheus and Neo couldn't even touch them! WHy did the machines just decide to stop the war when they were so close to winning against the humans? Yeah, Neo did them a favor by taking care of Agent Smith. Big f***ing whoop. They could drop the fleshbodies and kickstart the Matrix anyway.<br/><br/>Some will say they liked the movie *Like my roomie* because it makes you think. Fine, I like thinkin. But ONLY if there's a clear cut answer waiting for me at the end of the journey. Like Return of the King. I know the story, but I am waiting and drooling to see what Peter Jackson has set up. The last two movies have been pure art, and I know he's not going to disappoint now. I said a silent prayer before Matrix:revolutions, praying it wouldn't suck... If it weren't for the platypus, I wouldn't believe in god."

But hail to the people who did the special effects, very impressive. And the open ending aswell, if i didn't know better there could even be a successor to this one everything is possible and left in the open, so one could still believe the matrix could be real, we'd just have to wait till someone offered to free our minds.<br/><br/>What's interesting about this movie is that die hero doesn't save the day and live happily ever after with is wife/partner.

"Nuada7","9","2","4","7 November 2003"," Maybe not what you wanted, but exactly what it should be.
","I'll try to steer clear of SPOILERS, but no guarantees.<br/><br/>""Matrix Revolutions"" is NOT some overblown techno-war movie full of nothing but explosions and Kung Fu.  It is not a film filled with blinding action sequences to the point of ignoring the fact that people think and feel.  It is not the original Matrix movie, though it does finish the story started therein.  It doesn't have a sappy love-story ending, a suave Bond or Indiana Jones ending, an explosive Star Wars ending, a Highlander final-battle ending, or any other overused stereotypical hyped up Hollywood ending.  In other words: this movie is probably not all of what you hoped and dreamed and wanted it to be.  That being said, IT'S A VERY GOOD FILM.  Just because it's not what you wanted it to be, just because the Wachowski brothers took it in a direction you didn't want it to go, just because characters have dialogue and don't just blow stuff up and fight the entire time does NOT make it a bad film.  Your expectations were wrong, get over it and enjoy this movie for what it is and not what you wished it were or thought it should be.<br/><br/>I'll also let you know that I am a Christian man and I saw this movie in that context.  If you think that you're the almighty king/queen of objectivism, you're an idiot.  No one is completely objective; it isn't possible.  You (or I) might be able to attempt to see something from alternative viewpoints, but that just means that we're not so subjective as to be blind.  As a Christian man, I thought that Revolutions and indeed the whole Matrix trilogy was a marvelous story with better religious imagery than should even have been expected.  If you didn't think that the religious imagery in this movie followed suit with the storyline, then you were fooling yourself by ignoring it in the first two.  If you are offended by religious imagery, you probably won't like this film.  You're also missing out on a number of the best movies ever since you'll have to strike off ""Cool Hand Luke"", ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Godfather"", ""Star Wars"", and many others for their use of religious symbolism (at least a dozen of the top 25 on this site, including all of the top 5).<br/><br/>Many people are digging at this film for having some rather corny, predictable dialogue.  Those people are hypocrites.  Most of the best movies ever are full of corny dialogue.  Watch ""Seven Samurai"" or ""The Godfather"" or ""Casablanca"" again and shut up.<br/><br/>Revolutions has several sections where characters dialogue instead of battle.  If you'd rather see nothing but explosions and combat, go watch ""Rambo III"", ""XXX"", or something equally mindless.  The dialogue is deeply philosophical, concerning issues of choice, freedom, peace, existence, purpose, causation, and natural balance.  In combining the action and the intelligence, the reality with the normative and meta-ethical consideration, this movie appeals to senses and minds instead of focusing on one and being devoid of the other.<br/><br/>""Matrix Revolutions"" has action, but not too much.  It has deep--albeit occasionally corny--dialogue, but not too much of either.  It has a great deal of religious imagery, but it does so without being offensive to other religious beliefs (insofar as I understand).  It has CGI, but it's used more delicately than the Smith battle in Reloaded.  It is by no means perfect, but it is even less what many (dare I say most) people wanted it to be.  The Wachowskis could have appealed to the masses and brought in more money and gone down in history as the makers of an innovative series of movies that represented the same braindead entertainment provided within their Matrix to keep the masses happy, but instead they went out on a limb and stuck to what they wanted the story to be: a combination of technology and theology that cinema hasn't seen before nor is likely to see again for a good while without being a copycat project.<br/><br/>I reiterate, this is a very good movie so long as you watch it for what it *IS* and not simply what you think it should be. 9/10"
"ADparaC","10","2","4","5 November 2003"," The Sci-Fi movie of my Sci-Fi movie geek dreams!!!!!!
","All I can  say is that Matrix Revolutions is a film for me.  I love this film!  I love this trilogy!  Science-Fiction is my favorite genre.  I love everything from B-movie sci-fi geek fun such as ""Valley of the Gwangi"" to VISIONARY CLASSIC sci-fi films such as ""Star Wars"" or ""Blade Runner"".<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions is a celebration of  all things awesome about science-fiction!  HOLY GOD is this film AWESOME!!!!   This is without a doubt, the best conclusion to a sci-fi trilogy I have ever seen.  Now, I love Reloaded.   I thought that film was an epic continuation of the greatest sci-fi film since Star Wars.   It was a film for me.  Revolutions is the end of this fascinating story.  This is film of answers and ambiguity.  The Wachowski Bros.  leave a lot of this story to you, the viewer.  Many things can be interpreted many different ways, especially the end.  All I can say is that it I love the path the Wachowski Bros. took.   Revolutions is the third act of the story.  EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE!!    Neo is on a journey to fulfill is his destiny.  The revelations are STUNNING!!!   Never before have I cared about a character in sci-fi films like I do here.<br/><br/>This is EPIC, EPIC, STORYTELLING!!   This is the deciding point in the war between man and machine.<br/><br/>The Zion dock battle is the MOST INTENSE FREAKING BATTLE THE SCI-FI GENRE HAS EVER SEEN!!!!  HOLY GOD!!!  No, really, HOLY FREAKING GOD!!  This is huge Zion mechs  vs.  thousands of Sentinels and  huge drill machines.  The people of Zion are fighting for their lives, doing anything and everything to keep these machines from destroying humanity.  Captain Mifune is the leader of the Mechs.  They fight with bravery and force against an opponent far more powerful.  The SENTINELS ARE BRUTAL!!  I have never seen anything like this before.<br/><br/>There is so much in this film. (minor spoilers)  There are many quiet moments that are truly classic.  There are many epic moments that are classic.  Everything with Agent Smith is perfect.<br/><br/>Everything with the Oracle is perfect.   Everything with Rama-Kandra and Sati is perfect.  There is a moment between Neo and Trinity which is beyond classic.  The farewell between Neo and Morpheus is LEGENDARY.  ""No, the honor is still mine""<br/><br/>Epic stuff.<br/><br/>The face/off between Neo and Agent Smith is the most important part of the trilogy.  WOW!!!  This is beyond explanation.   This is sci-fi heaven!  I can't explain how truly stunning this is.  This is the climax of the story.  This is an electricity bolt of sci-fi cinema!!!<br/><br/>(Minor spoilers)  The speech in the crater is LEGENDARY!! I have only expressed the beginning of my love for this film and trilogy.  There is so much to love here.   The Wachowski  Bros. and their cast and crew have created a trilogy  for the ages.  THE MATRIX TRILOGY IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE SCI-FI TRILOGY OF ALL TIME!!!  That's that!"
"Chickenpotpie-1","10","2","4","5 November 2003"," I liked it...
","If you liked Reloaded, you'll love this movie... if you didn't like Reloaded, you'll probably love this movie even more. It surpasses Reloaded in every way possible. The graphics are ten times better, the Wachowski's got rid of their ego trip and decided to make a movie, and the story line isn't confusing at all. It's straight up war against machines. There isn't too much kung-fu, there isn't too much war, it's nice and evenly spread out in the film. Some shots were visually incredible. The only weak thing about this movie would be most of the dialogue. Everything that comes out of Agent Smith's mouth is almost genius, but everything that escapes anyone else is pretty much guarenteed laughable dialogue. The ideas are cool, it's just most of the lines are predictable. I found many places where i would recite the lines before they were said. It is a great ending to a great trilogy, and makes up for any mistakes Reloaded did. Though you can't beat the first one, you sure can follow it up well enough."

","I understand that a few people may be just a bit (or a lot) disappointed, but seriously, it does NOT DISAPPOINT!!! Hell, i wasn't expecting a traditional happy ending, though i know damn well i wanted one!! but the film is just so great, and groundbreaking, and innovative, and beautiful.<br/><br/>i've read about ppl b@#%$*n' that the first moments r boring, which is obvious that they probably haven't even seen it. there's dialogue with such beautiful philosophical meaning, shorter and much more significant than the architect ranting in RELOADED. Agent Smith (brilliantly portrayed by Hugo Weaving) is just funny. And maniacal. And insane. But you'll love him at the end. There are scenes the fans of the first Matrix will love. You'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>Will not say whether the ending is good or bad. You can talk about that on your own time. Revolutions will grow on you. It is an amazing conclusion to the Matrix trilogy. All the characters (and the actors who've played them) have done their jobs, excellently. As well as the Wachowski Brothers, their direction and the screenplay are brilliant in ALL 3 MOVIES.<br/><br/>And by the way, let's get one thing clear. Its absolutely POINTLESS to try to pit the Matrix and LOTR against each other. They're both incredible movies with great stories.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions - 9.9-10"

"horosha","9","2","4","6 November 2003"," A great conclusion to the Matrix Trilogy
","Matrix Revolutions was very good in my opinion. In some ways better than Matrix Reloaded. I won't go into detail and spoil anything for anyone but I will just say that the action/battle scenes were better than in Reloaded as well as the effects. Action wasn't as repetitive and the effects weren't quite so video game like (ie the ""100 Smiths"" fight in Reloaded).<br/><br/>This is not to say that I didn't like Reloaded. As with any movie there are little problems here and there (the aforementioned video game-like effects and repetitive aspects to some of the fighting) but over all I really enjoyed Reloaded. I just think, in my opinion, Revolutions didn't have as many problems.<br/><br/>As far as Revolutions goes I really liked how the story was told and concluded. Characters that weren't of real importance from the last film come into play more while the opposite for others. I had guesses about the ending and thought I had a few scenarios already figured out but they surprised me with this one. Not in a Shyamalan way though. Just a nice turn to things that I hadn't anticipated.<br/><br/>I am sure there will be some out there that will hate it though. Some people just build up expectations so high that nothing could satisfy. But as for myself I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to anyone who liked the previous two films even a little.<br/><br/>One more final note. Judging the film on it's own it IS a little unbalanced. But as a ""part II"" of the Matrix Sequels it is great. In some ways I like to consider Reloaded and Revolutions to be one long film split into two pieces (kind of like Kill Bill). Rather than one being a sequel of another as Reloaded was to The Matrix."
"wolfy_the_black","7","2","4","6 November 2003"," Why are people saying it stunk?
","I just recently got back from seeing this movie, and I have to say it was a great ending to a great trilogy.  Sure it wasn't as good as the first one, but what sequel is?  I though the movie was a little slow at times, but it was never boring.  In my opinion, I think that everybody that said this movie was a let down was because they didn't get it.  I understood the movie fully, and got everything out of it.  Just open your mind a little and really look at the movie beyond it's surface.  Then you will enjoy it."
"FilmWatcha","10","2","4","6 November 2003"," Mind-blowingly entertaining
","The Matrix Revolutions is the third and final chapter in the amazing Matrix series. And it goes out with more than a bang (and yes, I know blowingly isn't a word, it seemed like the best way to describe this movie though).<br/><br/>
 The movie follows the journey of Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Smith (Hugo Weaving). The movie is also about the machines that are coming closer and closer to the last human city, Zion.   This movie is action-packed. And the action is the best ever recorded on film. The special effects are obviously and by far the greatest special effects of ANY film, and I say that as fact, not opinion. The computer-generated effects are at the level were they are fully integrated with the real life sets and actors and actresses. It is impossible to tell the difference of real and computer-created (well, we know that they didn't make hundreds of thousands of machines to film, but it seems as though they did, since they look so real). The fight scenes are amazing--it appears as though there are no special effects, just people doing these amazing things (of course, that is impossible, but it really looks like they got people to fly). Not only that, but the special effects accomplish feats which have never been dreamt of, let alone put on film. The martial arts in this film are also pretty amazing.  <br/><br/> The story is marvelous. It pushes the movie full throttle, and every frame is totally relevant to the story. Every fight scene is part of the story, and every fight scene has been totally tailored to the characters involved and the situation.   The acting is astonishing. This film is the greatest acting challenge out of all the films, and all of the actors and actresses meet and surpass that challenge with stunningly emotional, intense and extremely cool performances.    The film itself is different the other two. It is faster and much more dark. And it is really not as thought-provoking. It is extremely dark. However, it is really the most entertaining (in my opinion). In fact, that what it is: pure entertainment, full skin to bone. And that doesn't seem like such a bad thing for a film to be."
"johnniefranchise","10","2","4","5 November 2003"," Are we talking about the same movie Matrix Revolutions?
","Lets get this straight, we all cant agree on which movies are good, which are bad.  We all have our likes and dislikes.  But I just cant seem to figure out why people are killing this movie with bad reviews.  This movie had it all, its a dope movie.<br/><br/>The plot was good, Reloaded set the tone and Revolutions followed through, the acting was sufficient, the action was eye droppin amazing.  I think the hour long action sequence at the end of the movie, (thats right...i said hour long) is one of the dopest Ive ever seen.  The fight between Neo and Agent Smith was done perfectly.  I dont understand why people are so anal about there reviews.  This movie had it all, great story, great action, and Persephone was lookin hot as hell."
"thelastgreyshark","10","2","4","5 November 2003"," Godlike
","The series is over and I leave the cinema quite sad that what I have waited for these past years is now over, what more is there to see... What I saw at 2:30 Switch Island Cinema, Liverpool, Revolutions' first showing in Britain, was everything I wanted and more. I sat right at the back and witnessed a crowd of people in awe at what they where watching. Not one person got up to go the toilet or for some food in the whole movie. Now that is a first. My body was paralysed because of the intensity of the experience. November the 5th Bonfire Night 2003 will remain in my memory for ever, superb day. What you can say after watching the 3rd is that any reviews for Reloaded cannot be complete reviews until Revolutions has been viewed. They are one movie. Revolutions picks up from the second Reloaded finishes, watch them both before you judge. 10 out of 10, gob-smacking visions from two brothers in 6 hours of 100 percent quality. They should never make another movie for they have reached perfection..."
"TrevDA","9","2","4","5 November 2003"," Enjoyable and engaging.
","I liked Revolutions.  It had pace and tension, which was something I felt was lacking in Reloaded. I was emotionally involved with the characters, feeling genuinely threatened by their circumstance.  I don't understand the people who are disappointed when they compare this movie to its predescessors.  It doesn't make sense to compare each installment in a trilogy to each other, because they are meant to be seen collectively. Revolutions extends and develops ideas in the first two films and I feel takes these ideas to a satisfying conclusion.  For those people who claim it doesn't make sense, all I can say is you haven't been watching carefully enough.  In fact, watch all three films again and this time, as Morpheous would say, ""free your mind."""
"erik_wetter","10","2","4","5 November 2003"," One of the greatest motion pictures ever made
","When I entered the theater I was afraid that I would be let down. But all my fears were not fulfilled, only my expectations. The battle of Zion was one of the greatest action scenes I have ever watched. The last confontration between Smith and Neo was absolutely fantastic. Espacially the last appearence of Bullet-time. The plot was not as advanced as many of the theories here have suggested, but after having seen the film, I can't really think of another ending that would fit better. The brothers don't reveal everything, we still for instance don't know why the war began in the first place, but I think that's good. Thank you the Wachowski brothers for having enlightened me. Whatever mistakes you may have made in the second movie, you are forgiven!"

Great pace, action, split stories through the plot, that lead to an unforgettable end. The acting, the characters really evolved. Some characters got a lot of minutes and become very important and charismatic (Niobe, Seraph).<br/><br/>The special fx... just incredible, to complete the plot, NOT to be the plot.<br/><br/>And yes... there is a PLOT. The story has an end, and there are more information and interesting dialogs than Reloaded.

And those who say the fate of humanity is left in question, it is answered in the last two minutes of the movie, and not left with any ambiguity.<br/><br/>

I feel that Revolutions really completed Reloaded, and I have a much better respect for Reloaded after seeing Revolutions.  I am not a big fan of Sci-Fi at all, but the Matrix series has certainly given me a new appreciation for the genre.  I thought Revolutions was a beautiful movie, definitely will be one of my all time favorite movies.  I went into this movie without reading any spoilers or getting myself hyped up over it, and it really blew me away.  I think that if I had spoiled some of it or allowed myself to get carried away in the frenzy, then it would have ruined some of it for me.<br/><br/>I am no film critic, but I definitely think if you truly appreciate the Matrix concept, then you will not be disappointed.

"bruman","8","2","4","5 November 2003"," great! but i waited something more
","I have liked but it gives the sensation of not being finished absolutely. The first episode open many doors and leave to see many possibilities of which happening, but in the second and third episode gives the impression that they are limited, no close the opened doors, putting barriers that themselves avoided in the first episode. History is very good but it seems that the world makes little when they leave matrix, hoped to see more about the world of the machines, something similar to Animatrix ""Matriculated"". The history of the end of Neo not is clear, there are several possibilities. I have liked, the film, the action, history but I think it lacks something. It can be that this fashion to do films of 2 in 2 or 3 in 3 is but better for the producers but not for the spectators, something already could be glimpsed in ""the Two Towers"". A supposition is single but that knows. Nothing more, I recommend it to everybody. PS: I hope that the Wachowski brothers have something prepared surprise, if it does not pass, anything not either."

No joke here, this movie is everything I hope for in a Science Fiction movie.<br/><br/>I've read some pretty bad reviews about this movie and I can't seriously find what movie did those reviewers watch but I can't believe it was this one. The Matrix Revolutions is an amazing piece of cinematic history and closes the Matrix trilogy with the golden key. As anyone would expect this movie is Reloaded Part 2 so, if you didn't like/understand Reloaded, you won't like/understand this movie as well.<br/><br/>The Wachowski's this time have fewer surprises in store so the story is pretty straight to the point in Revolutions. A noteworthy aspect to this movie is that all the questions that may have tormented you after seeing Reloaded are pretty well answered - there are those, of course, who will say they aren't simply because either they didn't understand, or it isn't how they expected.<br/><br/>This movie is, for me, the definition of Science Fiction itself. Revolutionary special effects and a brilliant storyline that doesn't insult the audience's intelligence. Although I could have hoped for nothing better than this closure to the Matrix saga, I must warn those that didn't like or see either of the two first Matrix movies that they should watch it before Revolutions to properly enjoy this film."

","People just never seem to be happy. I was quite skeptical going ito this film. Especially after the horrid sequel that proceeded it. But I must give credit where it is due. And the final chapter in the trilogy certainly deserves it in abundance. It has what it's predecessor didn't. Entertainment value. Although the acting was still mediocre filled with some poor performances, the chemistry non existent. The dialogue wasn't as philosophical but it was more cheesy this time around. The film managaed to suceed on many levels it did spout some charachter growth, make some sense of the trilogy, have fantastic action sequences, a kick butt score and a helping of great entertainment which is what the original had presented. I always had though the matrix to be clever but never anything more than big budget hollywood bonanza. And this signifies the ending of a somewhat overblown but all together entertaining film series. To even try and explain what would happen would be to give to much away. But the film is definatly worth the admission it should have the mainstream audience reaching for their wallets for showings to come."

","1st Matrix was really mind-blowing, and I was a bit worried if 2nd and 3rd installment would be equally mind-blowing as well (afterwards I learnt that it was designed to be trilogy since the very beginning).  I was satisfied with Reloaded and Revolutions.  There are negative reviews on this, which I understand, but Revolutions did let me think about our daily living in a philosophical way (e.g. is love for real or just an imagination?), just like the 1st installment.  I gave 9/10 to Revolutions.  I was very lucky to experience Matrix trilogy during my lifetime.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>what did Neo mean by ""peace""?  Just a peaceful life in Zion, or more than that? (I guess he meant more than just Zion)  What happened to those who are still jacked-into the Matrix?

I know, I'm quite alone with this opinion, but Revolutions is the best one of the trilogy. Matrix and Matrix Reloaded is packed with Kung Fu action - enough, really enough. Revolutions is more into machine battling, and it's doing this in the finest way. Without ANY flaw. (Maybe the dying part - not telling who - but hey!

","The 3rd installment took less time to absorb than the 2nd installment and spent a greater majority of the 2+ hours battling it out. It is more subdued and less cerebral than Reloaded, but it delivers just like the 2nd installment and the differences are much like the 1st and 2nd movies. I felt it wrapped up nicely. The ending is tragic but holds true. The Matrix Trilogy is complete! It is the weakest of the 3 only because it came last!! I can't wait to see it again!"

"jaredpahl","8","0","0","12 June 2020"," A Different Kind of Matrix-Flavored Action Spectacular.
","With expectations significantly lowered by The Matrix Reloaded's ridiculous pseudo-philosophical hogwash, the trilogy closer, The Matrix Revolutions, came as a bloody, brutal, action-packed surprise. No one can expect a Matrix sequel to compete with the Wachowski's visionary original, but even by dumb summer action standards, The Matrix Reloaded was too pompous for its britches. The half-baked (in every sense) ramblings came at the expense of pace and fun. Revolutions rectifies this with a story that is easier to follow, and a greater embrace of The Matrix' inherent goofiness.<br/><br/>I won't pretend to remember what exactly Reloaded was about. At this point in the trilogy, the rules for what can and can't happen, who is jacked in and who is a program, where anybody is at any given time, and why anybody is fighting anybody else in The Matrix, were, at best, muddled. Inheriting this mess from themselves, the Wachowski's decided to slim down the exposition for Revolutions. In essence, all you need to know about Matrix 3 is that the real-life humans are fighting a war against real-life machines, and Neo is trying to save the Matrix from Agent Smith. Any questions of ""why"" can be answered with one word: ""love"". Sure, it's simple minded, borderline stupid, but it gives orientation that Reloaded lacked. I will even admit to feeling rather struck by a character death or two. The unwieldy strings are tied together more or less satisfactorily by the finale.<br/><br/>Like the original Matrix or its first sequel, Revolutions is a huge science-fiction action spectacular. But where Reloaded came across as re-heated leftovers of the Gun-Fu Matrix style, Revolutions takes a different direction: massive, CGI, robot battle overkill. Those who scoff immediately whenever special effects begin to fill the screen, miss out on how exciting these sequences can be, especially when the effects work as well as they do here. There is real invention to the action of The Matrix Revolutions. You get the sense that the Wachowskis are having a blast visualizing the giant drills crashing through the human's fortified dome city, the swarms of flying octopus robots, or the mech-suits as they fire unending streams of bullets at the invaders. There are a couple bullet-timey shootouts and fight scenes that recall the first film, but they aren't given the spotlight. Rather, Revolutions biggest and best scenes are its most overblown. The centerpiece Siege of Zion clocks in at a happily indulgent half hour plus, and the climactic fight is the rainiest, punchiest, most epic super-powered brawl you're likely to ever see (And boy does it make me wish we'd get a Superman movie with that kind of energy).<br/><br/>I, for one, don't find the Wachowski's world-building in the Matrix to be all that interesting. The high-concept premise of the first movie was a bolt of creative genius, but the attempts to bolster that premise generally fall flat. That said, in a movie that prioritizes action spectacle over dour philosophy, I can buy into it. I was rooting for those scrappy humans in The Matrix Revolutions, as dull as they may seem. I was thrilled by the battle scenes and over-the-top fights. Plus, I was interested in finding out what was going to happen by the end. Because things do happen by the end. There are resolutions, denouements, and grandiose, epic music from Don Davis which fits the images much better than the early 2000s techno-crud from Reloaded. This is a very good movie when accepted on its own terms. A screamy, sweaty, slam-bang great time at the cineplex.<br/><br/>83/100"
"fernandoschiavi","8","0","0","7 June 2020"," It is not the ending that the franchise deserved, it is a film full of ups and downs in almost equal doses, bringing great concepts interspersed with terrible executions
","""Matrix Revolutions"" is already endowed with the enormous responsibility of knotting all the loose ends left by the previous film (the first is already closed by itself) and these were not few. Reloaded ends with a completely open ending, fulfilling the role of part one within a double narrative. It is an inglorious destination for a film that closes the saga of Neo, Trinity and Morpheus with academic competence. Note that the competency cited here has two meanings. The first is good, since the adventure ties ""most"" of loose ends, guarantees two hours of entertainment and still leaves ample scope for discussions. The other, bad, is the lack of innovation, which favors conventional solutions, already seen and reviewed in the cinema.
Revolutions expands the emphasis on Reloaded, focusing much of its narrative in the real world, where machines invade Zion in what would be the last battle of this long war. It is in these sequences, outside the Matrix, that the work really sustains itself, counting on an unceasing rhythm of action that suffers from an exaggerated duration, but that, in the last instance, manage to arrest the viewer. Evidently these do not lack their own defects, which, in general, boil down to an artificial drama created by the focus on certain characters (read Zee, his partner and Captain Mifune, the only ones who really do anything in the fight), which only diminishes our perception of the general picture of humanity's survival.<br/><br/>The final fight between Neo and Smith - a street fight between Supermen - is great, the attack of the machines on Zion is exciting and the visit to the city of 01, the capital of the machines, quite satisfactory for those who checked ""The second rebirth "", episode of the Animatrix series. Also noteworthy is the writers' treatment of women in the film. Trinity has never been so determined and tough, Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) eclipses Morpheus and even Zee (Nona Gaye) appears to save the day. Matrix women do not take offense at home and never lose their femininity. The long battle in Zion is interspersed, in parallel assembly, with the ship chase between Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and the sentries. This second approach ensures that the rhythm of the work is not broken, while bringing greater tension than the repeated shooting in the human city. What does not go out of our mind as we watch the hordes of sentries invading Zion (emulating a swarm of wasps) is the waste by the creative team in inserting new machines into combat, which could insert a greater touch of dynamism into the fight. Still, some specific plans can be truly frightening, while revealing the fragility of the man around the machines.<br/><br/>On the other side of this devastated world, we have Trinity and Neo traveling the dark surface of the planet to reach the city of machines. Here is the real highlight of the film, which provides us with true delights of science fiction. The human creation fields are again shown and remain as terrifying as their first appearance in the Matrix. In addition, finally, new machine designs are shown, also inspired by insects in order to quickly capture fear in the viewer. Despite Neo's ""messianic"" vision, the way he sees the world of machines inexplicably comes up with an interesting antithesis with our look at it: the dark is replaced by beams of light that make us forget that they are the ""villains"". When Neo arrives in the city of machines - a journey that, increasingly, proves itself without turning, it is phenomenal. After being provided with one of the most ecstatic scenes in the trilogy - the bomb barrier and the rise over the clouds - we fell back into the darkness of the real world. The little glimpse we have of the city only leaves us with a taste of ""I want more"". At the source of the machines, which adopts a human face in order to establish an element of identification with its interlocutor - what follows is a short and surprisingly human dialogue and one of the few cases in the franchise where a scene should have been extended. It is impossible, however, to fail to notice the respect for which the leader of the machines has towards Neo - the death of the protagonist is practically serene in his hands and his body is resting - and not thrown - on the ground, to be, in then taken to the unknown, corroborating the human side of its greatest enemies within this universe. The film should have ended at that point, dispensing with the unnecessary epilogue with Sati, the Oracle and the Architect.<br/><br/>Matrix Revolutions proves the richness of the universe conceived by the two sisters by presenting new layers of virtual reality that serve as a scenario for action: the subway station, for example, reveals itself as a kind of ""dump"" of that complex operating system; while the elevator of the nightclub visited by Morpheus and Trinity contains a red button that, instead of indicating a floor, only bears the word 'Help'. In addition, the film introduces the curious concept that programs would also be able to love (discovering this, Neo questions: 'But this is a human emotion', and hears the great answer: 'No, it is a word').<br/><br/>Here in the third film we have the creation of constant parallels in order to demonstrate that we are not far from the machines. The most obvious of these is Commander Lock, who has a more methodical thinking and dispenses with the beliefs of Morpheus, who, in turn, represents the more human side of the equation. It is clear that both sides are fighting for survival and war only exists because of a stone thrown centuries ago. The parallel extends to the Oracle and the Architect, both programs within the Matrix, but which have almost opposite thoughts (something made clear by the dialogue between Neo and the Architect in the previous film).<br/><br/>But not everything is correct. Agent Smith, which was a very well-done concept in the Matrix, has already begun to undergo a dubious treatment in Reloaded, but it is only in Revolutions that the script really completely spoils the main antagonist of the franchise. You see, the premise of a corrupted program taking the place of the Matrix is not only acceptable, but quite interesting - the problem lies in the cartoon execution conceived by the Wachowski. Evil laughter, lightning falling behind the villain, catch phrases and threatening poses are just the beginning of this completely unnecessary outcome.<br/><br/>At the end of the second chapter, for example, the viewer was surprised by a bombastic revelation: Neo had become able to use his powers in the 'real world'. Now, it is to be imagined that an important data like this (so relevant that it served to close the film) would be clarified in the next part, right? For this is not what happens, since the Oracle is limited to establishing the obvious: the power of the Chosen One can manifest itself in several worlds. What's worse, to prevent the public from realizing that no puzzle is being solved, the Wachowski create new mysteries, that is: they propose more questions when they should be concerned with answering those already asked. So, instead of implying an old - and completely expendable - relationship between Seraph and Merovingian, filmmakers should be concerned with clarifying who (or what) the latter is. In fact, they did not even try to maintain consistency between the last two parts of the trilogy: in Reloaded, Captain Lock stated that he would need 'all the ships to survive the attack' of the sentries, criticizing the fact that Nebuchadnezzar was released to leave. The curious thing is that, in the final chapter, no ships are used during the battle against the machines. And, after all, what happened to the Gemini who worked for Merovingian, and who were so prominent in the previous film?<br/><br/>Featuring a grandiosity, almost epic soundtrack, Matrix Revolutions puts its strength in the great visual effects, keeping the viewer's attention with spectacular images of hundreds of thousands of Sentinels invading Zion. And, once again, the Wachowski prove to be masters in directing action sequences - since, in this regard, the film does not disappoint. Unfortunately, they do not show the same sensitivity when it comes to dialogues, which again sound pretentious and, at various times, simply laughable ('Hope is an indulgence for which I don't have time').<br/><br/>As if that were not enough, the sisters are unable to find a plausible justification for the change of the actress who plays the Oracle (the original, Gloria Foster, died after completing the works in Reloaded): after saying that ""there is no easy explanation"" for the change in his appearance, the character says that ""had to pay the price"" for a certain choice. Now, if the new look is a kind of 'punishment', a consequence of a certain attitude, why does it remain similar to your old self? Why not radicalize and transform the Oracle into a deformed man or a very old woman (as if his 'effort' had robbed him of life)?<br/><br/>However, the most frustrating aspect of Revolutions is the Wachowski's neglect in handling the plot's outcome - and I don't mean just the lack of answers to important questions (How did Smith get into Bane's body? What does Merovingian want?), But also to the solution to the conflict between Neo and Smith: what, exactly, happened there?<br/><br/>Finally, ""Matrix Revolutions"" still fails to involve us in the dramas of its characters. And the reason for this coldness in the trilogy is obvious: regrettably, the Wachowski see their characters as the Architect sees humans: as simple pieces of a game, not as individuals. The feeling is that ""Matrix Revolutions"" has abandoned much of the philosophical issue and has been concerned with delivering a film filled with uninterrupted action. It is definitely not the ending that the franchise deserved, it is a film full of ups and downs in almost equal doses, bringing great concepts interspersed with terrible executions."

","Matrix Revolutions is expectedly a movie that delivers more action and resolution than the other films. Concordantly, the first few scenes displayed the struggle that humanity had against the machine invasion, and bane prowling through the real world aspirant for revenge. The explosion of success that both prequels enjoyed, justified a dignified closure that answered many of our remaining questions. We partially got that. Some holes in the plot remained unanswered, which seemed irresponsible considering the expectation people had of this movie, but some inclusions were also refreshing surprises.<br/><br/>Immediately in the first scenes of the movie we feel the threat looming in the dialogue and the tension rising in various characters. The human resistance in Zion was one of my favorite parts of the movie. The vibrant desire to defend the banner of one's species was palpable. The characters demonstrated in their rendition the passion and convictions that they enjoyed in their desire to defend their species, brilliantly inspired by Nathaniel Lees as Mifune. We also get the other side of the coin by experiencing characters that symbolized peace, love, sacrifice, and devotion. Sati and her family were a good metaphor of the peace of mind that one can acquire in the abyss of loneliness by reaching a state of care and compassion. The father was even willing to lie to the Trainman and risk his chances of saving his daughter in order to help a stranger: this is the state of enlightenment.<br/><br/>The Merovingian--the program that traffics on the why of people in the Matrix-trapped Neo in a program without any escape. Neo got impacted by a traumatizing event, where he does not understand how he was able to stop sentinels, and, subsequently, he was trapped in a program that has circular movement. The conceptual connections are interesting.<br/><br/>The dialogue between the architect and the oracle is another metaphor of chaos and order. The architect is the creator of order in the matrix, and the oracle is the program that creates anomalies and chaos within the order, but also the program that its purpose is to examine human psyche. The oracle was the main catalyst for the peace between the machine and humanity to end the war. In the last dialogues, before agent smith duplicated her, she repeated continually a phrase: no one can see beyond a choice they cannot understand. The architect was never actually able to perceive the abilities of Neo and agent smith; he was never able to see beyond that. The only entity that was able to perceive the peace between the humans and the machines was the all-knowing oracle.<br/><br/>Agent Smith was the polar opposite of NEO. He was an agent of destruction. Neo accomplished peace between the machines and the humans by the power of love, as clichÃ© as it sounds, and Agent Smith planned to self-replicate until he destroyed anyone that crossed in his way: Love vs Destruction. Ultimately, Neo by yielding to the power of the machines and sacrificing for the betterment of humanity was able to stop the extinction of humans."

"filipemanuelneto","6","0","0","17 January 2020"," Greater vanity and presumption than quality
","This film is the end of a trilogy that started very well but ended up derailing quickly. Extremely ambitious and very original, it was difficult to keep the flame burning throughout three films. This film, in particular, is the immediate continuation of the action of its predecessor, and suffers from the same problems and flaws, although it is slightly better, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The film continues to look cool and to rely heavily on the style that it created right at the beginning of the film. The action and the strong special, visual and sound effects are still there and continue to make everything look incredible, but it no longer surprises us and it just isn't the same anymore. The same goes for the soundtrack, which no longer has the power I felt in the first two films. The script continues to tell a strange story, but that is still not the problem. The problem is that the film seems to want to bet on everything without actually doing so. And so we have, for example, the Merovingian's reappearance without this bringing any positive additive to the film ie more than a cameo. This is just to give an example of how strange some of the script options were. The film also has a dissonant and uneven rhythm that makes certain parts of the film drag as if they were dying. The actors continue to look good, and I think they seemed to me much more human in this film than in any of its precedents. The problem was some of the dialogues, which just don't make any sense.<br/><br/>I think the directors of the film let themselves be carried away by the success and the recognition and, at a certain moment, they thought they were making a gigantic masterpiece of the cinema, and that this ended up being reflected in the film, giving the feeling that the film wants to be more than it is. And that is always boring. Instead of doing a job that could match the quality of the first film, the directors fell asleep under their own laurels."

","Starting from the moment the second film ended, this one presents the final part of the war between humans and machines.

Between them infiltrates former agent Smith, more powerful than ever, threatening even the mighty machine.<br/><br/>This movie brings the conclusion to this trilogy, and, like the others, looking simply gorgeous and featuring impressive combat sequences, while, in contrast, struggling with a story which leaves a lot to wish for. As a disappointment for me, they tend to focus much more on the real world, leaving the Matrix fewer chances to impress you. The finale it brings is also a letdown, but I won't spoil it, just in case. Another complaint I have has to do with the citizens of Zion, which, mostly because of the plot, seem to be as stupid as they are numerous. They are facing extinction, they don't believe in Neo and all they are willing to do is stand there and pray to hell knows who, let alone doing something remotely useful. It's a sad ending to such a franchise, from my perspective, but overall, it isn't a bad movie. You have to see it for yourself."

","""The Matrix"" is one of my favorite movies. Seeing as how everyone was talking about how awful this one was, I was surprised that it had a rating of 6.7. I guess I agree that it's not good, but it's at least okay. Probably the best part is how it really does get better in the last two thirds. The first third of this movie is dreadfully boring and I just don't know why these actors aren't raising their voices. It makes everything rather bland. You can really notice the lack of emotion more in this, while it wasn't as apparent in the previous films. I think the main problem is how this film was paced.<br/><br/>It shows twenty minutes of the humans in Zion fighting and then twenty minutes of Neo fighting. I would have enjoyed it more if it had combined the two. There was little variety that way. Nonetheless, there were definitely good things about the movie. The CGI is very good and it even seems to have improved from the last movie. Considering they were filmed right next to each other, that really is saying something. Hugo Weaving is just so entertaining as Smith. While it's difficult to take him seriously, it's still really hard to not be entertained on some level by this guy. I'm impressed by the sheer number of different roles he's had in popular franchises.<br/><br/>I just love the idea of Smith escaping to the real world. They did that part fairly well. Then again, it might just be because like I said before, he's such an entertaining character.<br/><br/>The basic story is that the humans are fighting the machines while Smith has taken over the Matrix. Neo decides to go to the machine leader to stop fighting if he defeats Smith. I admit that this conclusion is really too convenient and seems like a cop out. It's still nice to see the conclusion of such a popular movie series. I bought ""The Matrix"" package films in one box set and I think it was money well spent. Even if the ending was mostly unsatisfactory, it's by no means awful. I guess I could recommend it if only because it's something that's really popular and does have some good variety. It even seems like they were trying to give all the characters some important role even though it didn't work out nearly as much as something like Return Of The King or Return Of The Jedi. I have a soft spot for third entries in a series...and also ones that have ""Return Of The"" in the title for some reason. **1/2 out of ****."

","What began as one of the most original, stylish & groundbreaking examples of sci-fi filmmaking eventually concludes on a heartbreaking low as The Matrix Revolutions fails in delivering a fitting finale & is arguably the weakest chapter of the trilogy which, instead of connecting the dots & tightening the loose ends, leaves the viewers wandering for answers by adding more questions to the pile.<br/><br/>Starting exactly where The Matrix Reloaded signed off, The Matrix Revolutions continues the journey of Neo who ultimately learns that he needs to travel to the machine city in order to end the war. The rest of his associates & Zion, however, prepares for their last stand against the machines as a massive army of sentinels manages to breach into the only remaining human city to kill every last man, woman & child.<br/><br/>Written & directed by the Wachowskis, the film offers more sequences set in the real world than in the simulated reality of the matrix but the siblings' struggle with the story which was so flawlessly executed in the first film is pretty much evident in this second sequel as they fail to provide a satisfying closure. Even the final fight the whole film builds itself up for turns out to be absolutely ridiculous.<br/><br/>Technically, The Matrix Revolutions is admirable in a number of aspects. The set pieces are astonishing to look at, the atmosphere is more sinister than before, camera-work is pretty good, VFX is a mixed bag for the action sequences set in Zion are very engaging while the very same moments in the matrix look stupid. The background score is probably the only aspect that has been consistently impressive in all three films.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Matrix Revolutions follows into the footsteps of The Matrix Reloaded & is a disappointment in every sense of the word. The action sequences are impressive to look at which will keep few viewers engaged but the philosophical ideas that got messed up in the second feature never sorts out & becomes all the more confusing.

","This was the worst of trilogy, and the gap is quite wide between this and its predecessors. It's still mountains better than most of the crappy movies today, but Matrix had to be on Matrix level and it wasn't.<br/><br/>The end of the trilogy, as the end of any story, matters more than the beginning, and shall I say, the beginning of this movie was a hell of a ride. Before I go pointing out what extremely was bugging about this installment, it needs to be said that Matrix is one of a kind movie being both entertaining to watch and brain-torturing. That two are very seldom to be put in 1 movie on such great levels, and to end such a story would be extremely challenging, however, in my opinion, got handled very much unsatisfying way for Matrix-standards.<br/><br/>1) Zion <br/><br/>First thing that continued to bother me starting from the second movie is how the Zion-part of the movie did not fit into the whole theme and atmosphere of Matrix. We get to be in Zion for the first time in the second installment, and already there was a question, why these people - survivors plugged out of Matrix, act so old civilization-ish. The part where Morpheus talks to the people reminds a scene from Gladiator. This, is offsetting when the Matrix-part of the movie is so technologically rich and puts your mind in a different type of place with all scientific visions that are meant to surpass the present time. <br/><br/>The two complete opposite tones wouldn't bother me much, if the one that is less favorable didn't get so much screen time in this installment. Endless Zion shootings at machines that are coming like a rain, commanders being brave and all, a chick madly riding a ship, all that lasts for more than half of the movie.<br/><br/>2) So little of Neo and the main characters <br/><br/>The characters you grew to love have pathetic appearances. Morpheus almost is not there, few fighting scenes. Neo, only last part. Trinity only a part of the last part Neo was in. Come on!<br/><br/>3)Story <br/><br/>This is the main difference between the second installment and the third one. The second installment had so much story and insight on what was happening - we find out more about how Matrix works, who is Neo, what was the prophecy really, who is Oracle, what are the ins and outs of Matrix, what type of programs exist and what they are meant for - all this and in the third installment all we get is Neo's understanding on how to solve an equation and put an end. That was the only thing in the entire movie that has a meaning, everything else mostly fight scenes and lovey- dovey. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind either, but it doesn't keep up with the rest of installments in terms of things that 'make you think'.<br/><br/>All in all I like the movie. I used to rate it 10/10 as it was Matrix, and I love the whole thing no matter what. But I wish that later on producers did not lose their touch on the subject and freak out on success. It's really simple."

Half a million sentinels are about to invade Zion.<br/><br/>2. The matrix program is about to have a catastrophic system failure because, according to the Architect, in order for humans to accept the matrix they must choose to live in the dream world, even at an unconscious level. But in the previous movie Reloaded, Neo (with guidance from the Oracle) being 'The One' who is to make that choice, decided 'nope.' <br/><br/>3. Agent Smith has found a way to replicate himself, and is taking over everyone's Avatar within the matrix. He has even found a way of taking over human bodies, and uses one guy to trigger an EMP that results in several of Zion's ships being destroyed along with their crews.<br/><br/>So its humans vs. machines vs. Agent Smith. Going into this movie, one hopes that the series will wrap up as imaginatively and interestingly as 1999's The Matrix. <br/><br/>It doesn't. Unfortunately, this is the least cerebral and mind bending movie in the series. There is a lot of action, and characters showcasing courage, but not many new ideas.<br/><br/>In the DVD extended features section, actor Lawrence Fishburne describes the movies in the Matrix trilogy like this: ""The first movie is about birth, the second movie deals with life, and the third movie is about death.""<br/><br/>Well, that seems like an oversimplification. But Lawrence Fishburne devoted years of his life working within the Matrix trilogy. So OK.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of the Matrix. This trilogy was my generations Star Wars. However, in my opinion Revolutions was the weakest movie in the series."

","Worst of the trilogy. In fact I wouldn't call this a Matrix movie, but it was decent. The action was great and over the top, the story was strong.

The only slow motion parts are in the final battle, which captures the face reacting to the punches. <br/><br/>It was a great conclusion yes, but it isn't The Matrix. This movie should have been called 'The War of the Machines'. The first one is and always will be the best one of the trilogy. I found that this one lacked the class the first two had, not to mention this one was rushed. We waited ONLY six months for this to be released.<br/><br/>The action like I said was good, the effects were good for its time and the script was well written, the acting is superb and the final battle was a great way to end it.

","You've heard it said...""check your brain at the door""...this is one of those movies that is brainless while pretending to be brainy (like the original). It fails miserably and their was really no need. The intriguing concept was already there. The template (or the Matrix) was created and the mythology was predetermined, so why turn it into a mindless exercise in excessive, paralyzing playtime.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are OK the first ten times you view the invasion, but like the fisticuffs battle with Agent Smith at the end, just goes on for ever and ever draining all shock and awe from the events and leaves the viewer, in effect, feeling like they are watching someone else play a video game.<br/><br/>Taken as an action film on its own it might pass as an eye candy (although quite depressing) look at another reality, but the coolness it invented is all but gone and the cyberpunk style has turned into Salvation Army chic. <br/><br/>After all, it is a sad ending to a clever, groundbreaking beginning and we are left with borrowed mumbo jumbo philosophizing and a bleak, depressing, finale despite the pastel sunrise."

","The Matrix Trilogy draws to a close and the final battle between man and machine and between Neo and Agent Smith approaches. Set immediately after the events of 'The Matrix Reloaded' the people of Zion prepare for the attack of the machines while Neo appears to be in a coma back on one of the two ships to have survived the recent conflict. He is in fact trapped somewhere between the real world and the Matrix; in a location that looks like an underground station. If he is to get away he must confront 'The Train Man' and Morpheus and Trinity must re-enter the Matrix and visit The Merovingian once again. Once he is out there problems are far from over; Neo has a feeling that he must head to the City of the Machines, something nobody has successfully done before, and the others must head back to Zion with the last remaining pulse weapon. When the attack begins swarms of Sentinels enter the city dock; they must not be allowed to advance any further or Zion will be lost.<br/><br/>There is plenty of action in this film... too much in fact; the plot lacks the depth of the original leaving us to watch a variety of spectacular fight scenes. These scenes are exciting and look great but go on for too long; while the fighting is going on the plot doesn't advance. At the end there is another Neo vs. Agent Smith fight but after the previous films this has a feeling of inevitability about it. The core cast do well enough although for much of the film they aren't really doing much as everything is focused on the battle for Zion. The military types are all gravel voiced and gung-ho in a way that is almost comical and you just know that the kid who has talked his way into the fight is going to play a key role in the end. It isn't a terrible film; it passes the time well enough and looks good; it is just a bit of a disappointment that the series had to end this way... to be honest I think it would have been better if 'The Matrix' didn't have any sequels as it didn't need them."

They're still flying about fighting. The sentinels are still on the rampage. There's so many special effects that you can't take 'em all in at once, which is pointless.

","I scored a 7 out of 10. I watched on DVD, so I saw the entire unedited movie. I watched again just now on television.<br/><br/>Overall, excellent acting.<br/><br/>In all three movies, the idea is explored that both the physical ""real"" world and the Matrix worlds have deterministic rules but both worlds have beings with consciousnesses inhabiting those worlds. Hence, those consciousnesses, which have free will, contradict the deterministic rules. The philosophical concept added to the original and ""Reloaded"" in ""Revolutions"" is the concept of Neo's mind separating from his body in the real world, since, if it can happen in the Matrix, why not in the real world? After all, both worlds are electromagnetic stimulation of the senses.<br/><br/>However, even after having seen all three movies in order, I still do not understand what exactly the program Smith does when it occupies some other Matrix inhabitant's matrix-constructed body. Does that kill (I assume) the person in the real world?<br/><br/>I also like the concept of the Matrix, Agent Smith more specifically, affecting or infiltrating the mind of a person in the real world. This concept was initiated in ""Reloaded"" and developed in ""Revolutions"".<br/><br/>There are other very small plot points that were not made clear, in ""Reloaded"" and in ""Revolutions"", which I really wished had been made clear by the end of the trilogy. Specifically, did Zion not have an EMP weapon to disable the sentinels during the big underground battle scene? Why did they have to wait for the Nebakenezzer to arrive to set off the EMP?<br/><br/>However, my BIGGEST disappointment with this movie is that it felt completely unresolved. I expected and wanted to see all the individuals unplugged from the Matrix. The architect and oracle in the coda of the movie try to explain it away by saying they'll unplug those who want to be unplugged and questioning how long the peace will last. Well, obviously, peace will not last long as long as people are still plugged into the Matrix against their full knowledge and will.<br/><br/>Otherwise, plot makes sense in ""Revolutions"". It moves along at an appropriate pace. I don't want to fault the movie too much, given the tension and excitement it creates. I admit that I felt slightly better about it upon a second viewing. But, I still do not understand why the biggest plot hole - immediate unplugging of all people - was not resolved at the end of the trilogy."

The final battle was all right but the way it ended wasn't good. I still don't understand it fully! The movie wasn't horrible - but I was just expecting so much more.<br/><br/>If your a matrix fan - you should definitely watch this (you don't want to have the series uncompleted) even if the movie isn't great.<br/><br/>6/10 - an average movie."

But like the previous instalment this falls flat on its face and delivers pointless continuous waves of visual effects. Stunning visuals again, but if there is no story to juxtapose them with, then they simply are a fact of the film, with no special significance.<br/><br/>The narrative dives into the ridiculous of the prophecy and continues with the inaccurate concept of choice in an attempt to reach its conclusion and bizarre open ending.<br/><br/>The man versus machine battle took long enough to arrive and after the built up anticipation it is a huge disappointment with too much screen time, conventional hero moments, predictable just in time scenarios and unorganised direction. The difference and surprise from the first film has been replaced by action convention and is the saddest thing to see.<br/><br/>Though the visuals and direction do not appear for the battle between man and machine, they are present and beautiful in a fine climatic showdown between Smith and Neo.<br/><br/>This narrative is complex like the previous two releases but it is hard to interpret. Unlike the first, Revolutions doesn't give enough information to even guess what happens at the end, not to mention how elements from the Matrix appeared in the machine world. Open endings are a fantastic device to create a sense of mystery to leave the viewer guessing, but here there is a quick conversation and that is that and the viewer will be left wondering what happened. Re-watching the film doesn't help either, but you wouldn't really want to as it is simply boring, pointless and doesn't have a point.<br/><br/>Sci-Fi films have always been about difference from reality and stunning visuals. Star Wars, Predator and Alien had visuals and question generating narratives. So why must all sequels ruin these original story lines by driving down the road of effects and action.<br/><br/>Like many other sequels this final part of the trilogy focuses on its computer to score hits with its viewer but fails miserably thanks to an action packed and pointless narrative"
"gooeysmoo","5","0","0","17 December 2008"," Not a bad film, but not on par with the first two
","The Matrix was a sci-fi masterpiece and a groundbreaking film in its own right. It had a terrific story, a solid script and memorable characters, and it still managed to be thoroughly entertaining. The Matrix Reloaded was a step down from the first film, but was still entertaining and the acting was still very good, especially by Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions continues right after where the Matrix Reloaded left off and follows the characters as they prepare for the final battle for Zion and as Neo prepares for the ultimate showdown with Agent Smith.<br/><br/>The best part of this film is definitely the visuals. Reloaded had the best visuals out of all the films, in my humble opinion, but Revolutions is not too far behind in the looks department. The battle for Zion looks magnificent. The fights in the Matrix, especially the first fight in the Merovingian's club and the final battle against Smith, are all very well choreographed and look and sound great. The soundtrack is also quite good. The film does manage to entertain and you won't find yourself bored very often.<br/><br/>The downsides however, lie with the story and the script, the latter being the worst of the two. The script in this one is filled with cheesy one liners and monologues that will have you rolling your eyes (especially the ""War is Over"" monologue by the annoying kid. Kill me now, please...). We are introduced to characters that we are supposed to feel sorry for and be attached to when something bad happens, but these characters are given hardly any back story or introduction, so when they're finally killed off, we don't really give a rats ass.<br/><br/>The story is also a mess. In this film the plot spins all over the place and unless you've taken the time to carefully analyze the story, you'll be wondering just what the hell is going on. There are also several scenes that are ultimately pointless and try to be intelligent but just end up being redundant. The train station scene at the beginning is confusing and tries to hard to be smart, but eventually just ends up leaving the viewer scratching his head.<br/><br/>The acting, for the most part, is quite solid. Keanu Reeves delivers the usual wooden performance, but he still manages to be convincing in some scenes, but in others he seems to lack emotion. Laurence Fishburne and Carry Ann Moss deliver solid performances as usual and do a good job in this film. Hugo Weaving is terribly underused and only appears in a few scenes, but he still delivers one of the stronger performances in the film. Sadley, Gloria Stuart, the woman who played the Oracle, passed away before Revolutions was filmed, and instead was replaced by the fairly flat and boring actress, Mary Stuart. Jada Pinkett Smith is OK, and the rest of the supporting cast is a mixed bag. Lambert Wilson (The Merovingian) and Monica Belucci (Persephone), are also terribly underused and only appear in one scene, which destroys any chance of character development these characters could have had. They were interesting and I would have liked to know more about them. Collin Chau as Seraph also gives a good performance.<br/><br/>The film in its own right is not a bad film and is on par with other sci-fi blockbusters with lots of CGI. It's big, loud, epic and gorgeous to look at (especially on Blu-Ray), but lacks the substance and heart the first two films had."

","First off, let me say that if you truly want to get the full blast of this movie, you should watch it and reloaded together as one. Really makes a better experience. <br/><br/>Their have been some negative comments toward this and the majority of the reason I believe is that really it is one big movie, it and reloaded just is chopped in half, so maybe some would feel going into it a little lost after not really remembering what exactly had happened in reloaded and being thrown into it as if they did.<br/><br/>It also kind of feels not really like a matrix flick, but more kind of a war/suspense thriller where as the others were more action oriented and this one more emotional and symbolic.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this one because it has a very epic feeling, ""The fate of humanity is in your hands or his..."" that line gave me goosebumps. It is much darker than the others, which I think is a good thing, and is more about the characters and their struggle to survive.<br/><br/>It is too about the relationship between Trinity and Neo, which you didn't really give a flying *Beep* about before this one. <br/><br/>The bottom line is that it is a fantastic film and if you want to be blown away by effects and a pure thrilling conclusion to a great trilogy, here it is.

"matlefebvre20","7","0","0","19 July 2007"," The second sequel cure
","Do you know the first sequel syndrome and the second sequel cure? <br/><br/>The first sequel syndrome happens when the sequel in question is of far inferior quality from its predecessor, often because it uses the same formulas, but the result gives a pretentious look to the final cut of the movie. Generally, it means more action, more explosions, more spectacle... and less brains.<br/><br/>The second sequel cure refers to the process which involves that the director or the producer (or both) becomes aware of the mistakes made in the second movie and tries to correct them by presenting a third movie that is closer in presentation to the first movie or by changing almost everything to avoid feelings of déjà vu or pretension.<br/><br/>""The Matrix"" was exceptional, a real masterpiece. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" was suffering from the first sequel syndrome. But the Wachowski Brothers applied the second sequel cure and this gives ""The Matrix Revolutions"", a far more satisfying effort than its direct predecessor, without reaching the level of perfection of the original one.<br/><br/>The storyline of the third film starts immediately after the end of the second one, thus putting a contrast with the latter which began six months after the end of the first movie. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is unconscious in the real world, but his mind is elsewhere, somewhere between the Matrix and the Machine world.<br/><br/>The bad news is that the Machines are about to attack Zion (with their 250,000 sentinels) and the humans' chances don't appear to be very high. Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) are thus heading for Machine City where they hope to find a way to stop the war.<br/><br/>The Matrix series, somehow like the Star Wars saga, lies almost entirely on visual content and much less on the characters. They can be cardboard, it doesn't stop the filmmakers.<br/><br/>What I didn't like from ""The Matrix Reloaded"" was the special effects which looked rather 'recycled' and simply upgraded from the first movie. The sequences of the fight and the highway crazy chase looked interminable.<br/><br/>What I liked from ""The Matrix Revolutions"" was the freshness brought in the treatment of the special effects and the fighting sequences. Apart from the final fight between Neo et Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), the special effects and the action sequences are almost all set in the real world. That means that the effects of bullet time and time-slicing are somehow left apart. This single fact is already a positive thing.<br/><br/>I especially liked the fight between Neo et Smith (as Bane) inside the Logos ship. The climax, where Neo see a fiery Smith, is profoundly chilling and almost look like a horror film extract.<br/><br/>I also appreciated the performance from Ian Bliss, who plays Bane who is possessed by Smith. Bliss is spectacular in his ways of re-creating Smith by speaking like him and by having the same facial expressions. A big cheer for him.<br/><br/>But it must also be said that Smith himself got promoted in a way of speaking. He was the main villain in the first film and only one of the main in the second one. But here, he finally completed his transition from simple villain to super-villain, a bit in the style of Lex Luthor or the numerous James Bond enemies.<br/><br/>The Battle of Zion is also of a prodigious grandeur and magnificence. The battle is long, but it is so captivating that it never becomes interminable.<br/><br/>In fact, nothing is interminable in ""The Matrix Revolutions"". Not even the final combat between Neo and Smith. Both fighters are about from the same strength and their confrontation is long. But unlike the fight between Neo and the clones in the second movie, it is not interminable. And there's a reason to that: everybody knows at that moment that the upcoming battle will be the last one. So we want to see all how it's going to end, regardless of the amount of time it will take. But it must be said that the Wachowski Bros. know how to make the suspense last.<br/><br/>What sparked controversy among fans, ordinary moviegoers and film critics is the film's conclusion. And in a sense, I support them. The movie's ending is terribly complex, perhaps even more than the legendary final puzzle from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". But in another sense, it's better that way.<br/><br/>Why? Because the conclusions from the first two movies were so simple and banal that they sadly looked like a typical ending from a Hollywood flick. The ending of the third movie (and consequently, the whole series) shows that there's some creative renewal from the directors' part and succeeds in showing that the series remain intellectual until the very end, even if it has lost some parts previously.<br/><br/>To summarize all of this, we can take the famous phrase of the Oracle (Mary Alice): ""Everything that has a beginning has an end"" and change it for: ""Everything that is mysterious has an explication"". And like any ambiguous ending, it will become the target of many speculations by the fans of the series, thus showing that the Matrix stimulates the minds till the end.<br/><br/>There also are mystical, almost poetic moments, like that famous scene where the Logos goes over the dark clouds of the ""desert of the real"", allowing Neo and Trinity to see the real sun for the first time.<br/><br/>""The Matrix Revolutions"" mixes up the purity with the artificiality. The purity of eternal love between Neo and Trinity and the purity of the battles set in the real world. The artificiality of the special effects, of the machines and of the Matrix itself. And this blend of the real and the fake works without causing any malfunction, or almost.<br/><br/>After a disappointing first sequel, ""The Matrix Revolutions"" fulfills its task and makes sure that the series doesn't crash down."

This movie was nowhere near as disappointing as that one, but it still had plenty of flaws.<br/><br/>The first hour is slow and needless (for that matter, the entire second movie was unnecessary in the grand scheme of things). There's a scene at a fetish club that has no reason to be in there except to try to recreate the lobby scene from the original, only far less interestingly. The entire role of the Merovingian - that entire plot line - what was the point of that? It was completely superfluous and didn't play any real part in the end. But in the second hour, the redeems your ticket price.<br/><br/>Some reviews complain that the leads all but disappear for a good half hour while we watch the supporting players defending the Zion invasion, trying to return to Zion, etc. The fact of the matter is, this was the best part of the film. I cared more about these people than the main characters. When we got back to Neo and Trinity, I was actually disappointed. Much of this movie felt like a video game: big action scenarios linked together with slow, questionably-acted cut scenes of dialogue. The final battle with Agent Smith and Neo? Cool enough - a true superhero slugfest, but dragged out and repetitive, much like Reloaded's ""burly brawl."" And the end? well, I won't spoil that for anyone, except to say.... that's it?

The city of Zion and its machinery is definitely worth seeing in action, and I confirm that about 250.000 sentinels are on screen ;-). Another good thing: Neo is about to reach his destiny - at last! One has to wait throughout a pointless encounter with the crooked-toothed guy who played the crazy helicopter pilot in ""Mad Max 2"" - any of you remember that one tenderly? -, but after that it's Full Metal Knit Jacket. An APU is something I definitely wouldn't want to compete with for parking space - how do all those guys get around without hitting each other? <br/><br/>About the rest I won't say much, it's a solution to a complex Trilogy. Is Neo dead, is he waiting to be recycled? It leaves one to wonder about a world where machines have the upper hand and war or extinction is always around the corner - would it be bearable for man to tolerate such a situation? So one may speculate how long ""this peace is going to last"" - ""As long as it can."""

But the best thing about it in all it's massiveness is it's minimalism and simplicity, comparing to the two sequels. There's some background in all that's happening and there really is a reason for things.<br/><br/>The Reloaded was a mediocre film. I'm not saying it's bad, but you gotta admit that watching some stupid freeway-chasing with millions fights going on, it gets REALLY boring. It could have been really good, if there would have been more dialog and explanation on how does the Matrix work 'cause the Architecht and the Keymaker are amazing characters. So where's the philosophy? Where are the questions? The choices? A few good ones but most of the philosophical dilemmas are just repeating the same that we faced in the first movie. It had potential, a lot of it, but the movie just couldn't reach it's predecessors level.<br/><br/>Revolutions: aaawww... Even the small bit of respect washed away as the mechwarriors started moving. I mean, was the point of this movie just to get every nerd in the world to masturbate on the screen? And where's the philosophy? THERE IS NONE. OK, the Trainman was cool but that was the only good thing about this movie. Nobody needs to see Neo doing this and that 'cause hey, I've seen it all already. Carrie-Ann Moss is good in this piece but after that I can't give credit to acting except for Jada-Pinkett Smith.<br/><br/>All in all a horrible film. I strongly advice for people to skip the Zion-war-part unless you want to see the most boring war-scene in the Wachowskis' history."

","I was a huge fan of the matrix series, but after I saw the third and last one (this one) I was amazingly disappointed. I even find myself in a long pause deciding about what I should answer to the person who asks me ""is this a good trilogy? Should I see it?"" It is THAT bad, believe in me.<br/><br/>*Spoiler* Overall, on the first movie you get to know Morpheus, Neo, Trinity, Agent Smith and the Oracle. These are the top five best stars of the movie, their acting is absolute amazing, and they are heroes!!! You become a fan of them. This makes the first movie a huge hit and I give it 8 out of 10 overall.<br/><br/>Now, on the second movie, the director and writers understood how important the five stars where, they kept these five actors as the center of the story. The heroic trio was: Trinity, Neo and Morpheus  it was just perfect, making the second movie another great hit; however on this movie, I don't know why, but the Matrix team decided to make some kind of interpolation between the movie and the game and they added a new character, completely worthless and meaningless  Niobe, the girlfriend of Morpheus. Every scene she was on, was worthless and should have been removed, I see no reason for it other than to ruin the movie greatness.<br/><br/>Well Any director would notice the flame of the fans around that new character and would remove her from the movie or at least keep her hidden; Not on this movie!! Nooo the third movie is half awesome and half garbage, all because of a few things: Instead of removing Niobe of the scenes, the movie director made a terrible choice; he added Niobi and some other characters that are related with the family of an unknown ship pilot  so with these characters, the writer and director managed to DESTROY the ENTIRE third movie!!! Morpheus is one of our Heroes (Among with Trinity and Neo) and yet for some unknown reason Morpheus was removed from the third movie, he does appear there, but in a few five to ten seconds talking here and there and then praying for his fate while three unknown female characters were doing HIS job. Well, I felt betrayed by the movie, there it was Neo and Trinity saving the world, The Oracle risking her own life, Agent Smith was fighting like no one ever did before!!! And then you look around and think, ""Hey, where is Morpheus? (His name means: God of Dreams) Oh... that is right, he didn't do a thing on this movie, the director and writers gave his heroic scene to Niobi and two other unknown female characters, not only that, but they were terrible actresses... So... the movie was a huge disappointment for me, because one of our heroes was left behind on this scrip, and that made me give a 5 out of 10, and if it wasn't for the amazing CG and special effects I would give a zero for this disrespect."

","When you see the screen filled with a trillion sentinels amidst a golden hail of bullets your jaw WILL drop I promise you. The film's opening needs thirty or so dull minutes to tie up loose ends from the previous film. Once it gets going, it's business as usual. The pointless, passionless annoying love story continues. The dialogue within the Matrix remains magnificently stilted; the dialogue outside of the Matrix remains appallingly stilted. Minor characters are used effectively, if a little cheesily. The finale is inevitably anticlimactic, as anyone who has worked out the reality of rewriting the source code will probably expect.

"Flagrant-Baronessa","6","0","0","30 June 2006"," Stunning, but in the end who really gets it?
","The Matrix has interesting philosophical ideas but they are so complex that they are not often executed well on film. The trilogy leaves a lot of for interpretation, which I personally usually appreciate in a film, but in the end, the philosophical context all becomes too epic to grasp and for anyone who can't put all pieces of the puzzle together (without reading like 5 threads on IMDb to ""explain it all""), it's a big mess.<br/><br/>What happens to the too ""big"" ideas is also what happens to The Matrix: Revolutions as a film. The end part of the trilogy is far too epic and grand to keep one's interest. There are gigantic battles, magnificent fights and climactic scenes after another that desensitise you after a while. I found that this was largely due to the overblown score that played on in the background to most of the movie. It becomes very tiring.<br/><br/>I don't know who did the conceptual art for Revolutions, but it looks like something out of a HR. Giger artwork and it's just so stunning it touches me. This film is truly a gorgeous science fiction triumph. This, of course, extends only to the visual part. Horrible music score and mediocre performances from almost all actors (except Hugo Weaving, who may be one of the best on screen villains of all time) drag The Matrix trilogy down.<br/><br/>In the end, you need to be extremely intelligent to enjoy this trilogy."
"dlancer","6","0","0","19 June 2006"," Better than your average movie, but that isn't saying much
","While this movie's special effects are astounding, there is too much that is lacking compared to its prequels.<br/><br/>It seems to be that this film's biggest problem was the lack of the Matrix itself. While the story requires a lot of the ""real world"" in order to reach the finality, there just isn't enough butt-kicking inside the virtual world that made the original Matrix so popular.<br/><br/>The philosophy and storyline are all there, but it had already been presented in The Matrix: Reloaded. What is left is a ""real world"" confrontation between humans and machines. Unfortunately, this has already been done in films like the Terminator and Robocop. We needed the majority of the fight to take place inside the Matrix where physics and all that stuff becomes warped and less limited. It is understandable that the fight be taken to Zion eventually, but too much was devoted to it.<br/><br/>This franchise started as a Kung-Fu, martial arts spectacular that tried to combine philosophy with science fiction. Unfortunately, as the franchise progressed, the Kung-Fu became less as the philosophy increased. It is okay if a science fiction action/adventure movie tries to make you think, but it went a bit overboard. And it's not like the message the philosophy conveyed was that difficult of a concept either. But it seemed like the message was made more difficult by the computer-like jargon that was used to speak it.<br/><br/>So I guess its best to stick with the formula that works. Its okay to have a lot of mindless action in a successful franchise that was based on mindless action."

","*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>I do find it odd the reaction these movies are getting. To be sure, the first Matrix movie was great and nothing like it had come before. It was a mix of martial arts, kung fu and 'super' tech. While nothing special with the dialog, the dialog was tight and crisp ... even in Keanu's monotone voice.<br/><br/>Still, I was puzzled as to the reason for the human 'matrix' used by the machines and with that the whole story fell apart. It was still highly cool, but there was a big element missing in an otherwise excellent action/adventure story. There was no reason for humans in the 1st Matrix movie. It was explained that humans provided heat energy for the machines - however cows could have done just as well.. and even better taking much less in the way of resources.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Reloaded and Revolutions - because you really can not compare one with out the others.<br/><br/>Reloaded was definitely the weakest of the three, however it had some of the best scenes. Neo's fight with the Merovigian's henchmen was my fav and we learned there were predecessors to Neo's ""the one"". It also strongly hinted at a counter to ""the one"" .. in Agent Smith.<br/><br/>Which finally brings me to Revolutions - aptly named as we now know its an on going process, but a process with a purpose. This movie is also much different than the first since its one part EPIC BATTLE for 'creation' (or mankind) and then some kung fu action guns scenes (though much less kung fu than the 1st). We know the 1st Matrix was perfect in every way - but it was also a disaster. We can speculate that after this disaster the Oracle was created, as the Architect clearly does not have the capacity to see beyond pure logic and his balanced equations. <br/><br/>So why are humans needed? Humans are needed for the computers to evolve. Humans need choice - no matter how little - if they are to have a soul or free will. The architect did not understand this, but the Oracle does and so they play their game with the Ones - they human with free will (Neo) vs. the self aware program (Agent Smith), either can win, either can lose and as was shown Revoltions its possible they can all lose: ie Smith wins and destroys everything - even the machines - from the inside out.<br/><br/>In my mind this was the best of the three - we have a conclusion that is not set in stone, but it resolves all the major issues. We know the Matrix has been saved (yet again) but its different this time -as Zion was spared because Neo was stronger than all previous 'the Ones'. It was not a perfect ending and that is perfect for me :)"
"jon2005","6","0","0","22 May 2006"," The Matrix Revolutions
","With The Matrix Reloaded considered a general disappointment, Revolutions certainly had its work cut out for it to bring the trilogy back up to the heights of greatness. Unfortunately, it fails. Whilst not a catastrophe of a film that it was first made out to be, it is nevertheless the lesser of the three films. <br/><br/>The story picks up straight after Reloaded ends, being as it is one story cut in half. We learn that the Zion fleet has been destroyed, and that the machines have resumed their tunnelling towards the last human city, while Neo's mind is trapped in a place between the machine world and the Matrix, his body lying in a coma on board the Hammer. This time, the Wachowskis have opted for a basic war film - without much of the philosophical banter that threatened to stall the second film - the centre of which is the machine attack on Zion, whilst Neo and Trinity go off on a mission of their own. The main problem with the film is the sidelining of major characters, particularly Morpheus, who spends the film sitting in Niobe's shadow, as they rush towards Zion. To relegate the best character in the series to such a small part is just asking for trouble  and the film does suffer for it. <br/><br/>The actual battle in Zion is well done, however. It is one of the most impressive sci-fi battles made, and yet not a single major character is involved, which makes the whole sequence seem a little shallow. It is also far too long, so whilst it is visually stunning, it starts to get a little monotonous in the end, which is a shame considering the amount of time and money that must have gone into making it. <br/><br/>Neo this time, particularly in the real world, seems more human than he did in the last film, especially when he is viciously blinded, in a clever little twist, by the real-world Smith. As he and Trinity fight their way through to the machine city, he shows us a vulnerability not seen since the first Matrix, which is a welcome break from the soulless Neo he was last time. Another change in the film is the oracle, played this time by Mary Alice. She still gives out her usual cryptic responses, but it is never explained (in film terms  the original actress died before filming was completed) why she has changed. Herein lies Revolutions' biggest fault  unless you have seen the Animatrix and have played the video game Enter the Matrix, much of what you see on screen is not explained in full. Only when you have experienced the full range of the Matrix brand will you be able to understand the film in its entirety. It is a perplexing decision that the Wachowskis made a film to such a specific audience, without a thought to those fans who didn't go out and do all the research into the other mediums. <br/><br/>But what of Agent Smith? By this time, he has managed to assimilate the majority of people in the Matrix, and has polluted the system so that it literally starts falling apart. Only Neo now has the power to stop him, and come the final confrontation, the audience is rewarded by a kung-fu mega-fight that is everything we hoped for after so much build up. Unfortunately, it is too late to save the day, as the film ends leaving us with more questions, and a sense of overwhelming incoherence in the film's quality; at once it is both visually stunning yet physically empty. We are left with a war film that is just too full of clichés, and has an ego too big to be justified. As a film, it just about stands up on its own, but as a sequel to the best action film of the 90s, it is the biggest let down of the year.<br/><br/>Rated: 6.5/10 <br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"
"eagle_owl","4","0","0","18 May 2006"," Just another blockbuster.
","The third film in the Matrix trilogy proves to be a disappointing finale. The scope of the action is almost unprecedented but this cannot disguise the film's fundamental deficiencies. The plot is even more threadbare than usual this time around.<br/><br/>The biggest mistake made by Revolutions is that the series' greatest asset (the Matrix itself) is barely utilised until the final reels, leaving a film which is hard to distinguish from any random sci-fi blockbuster, throwing special effects at the screen that would make even George Lucas's eyes bulge. When the humans are defending Zion, the effects are truly epic, but it goes on too long, and Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are not even involved, distancing the film further from the 1999 original.<br/><br/>The best thing about the first Matrix film was its notion of a world not unlike our own filled with ordinary people going about their daily lives, but who were really part of a gigantic program. Even Neo began the film as one of these people, until he was made aware of the reality. This was a terrific concept, which the sequels failed to carry forward. In Reloaded our heroes often ventured into the Matrix, but it no longer bore much of a relation to the world we know.<br/><br/>Both the sequels suffer from the presence of far too many minor characters, feeling like an attempt to ape the ensemble cast of Lord of the Rings. The trouble is that most of these characters are hardly fleshed out at all. Whereas Reloaded used numerous kung fu sequences inside the Matrix to distract attention from the slightly tedious main plot, Revolutions is forced to tie up this plot, and it has only 2 hours in which to accomplish this, an almost impossible task.<br/><br/>Revolutions is not a terrible film, but it is just another blockbuster, and most of the originality which marked out The Matrix has been lost. It's a shame the series had to end in such a conventional way."

","As usual, the original Matrix was the best. Reloaded was a solid follow up but didn't leave as much in question, or as much in replay value, as the original did. Revolutions however... I dunno. I got sick of the real world pretty fast in here, if you didn't like the real world in Reloaded prepare for some hell because about 75% of this movie takes place in the real world. Also, much like Reloaded, there isn't as much to learn about the Matrix as there was in the first one. It seems almost assumed that there is little left to learn about the Matrix which is more than just a little disappointing. Actors did just as good of jobs in this one as they did in the previous Matrixs. This one however I was most disappointed with. Mostly the ending is what made me frown but the final battle was another thing I yawned at. Sorry but leave a battle like this for the animes, it looks better. The Smith fight in Reloaded was 10 times better than this one. If you've seen the other two seeing this one probably won't do a whole lot for you. You'll probably end up frowning at the ending (much like I did). Movies with this much potential shouldn't feel so empty in the end."

","(I do not think what I write here can be counted as a spoiler, but I ticked the box just in case). The Matrix Revolutions is a brilliant conclusion to the trilogy, ending the perfect birth, life, death cycle that the whole story seems to explain. I found that this movie didn't grip me as much as the first two, the same as the second one didn't quite level up with the first. The thing is that not much happens in it, if you cut out the thousands of fight scenes then you'd be left with about half an hours worth of movie. I admit that I like battle scenes, I normally enjoy them a lot, but they were just too long and a little repetitive. The philosophical dialog in the first two movies has been replaced with guns and death, I was at least expecting Smith to do one of the usual 'psyche up fight talks' before the end, but not much was said, apart from 'I'm going to kill you' - something which is incredibly clichÃ© in the good vs. evil world. I think that the main problem with The Matrix Revolutions is that the first too films asked questions that the final one couldn't answer. Simply because these questions are ones we have asked since the dawn of time and never been able to figure out. I like the idea that the point in life is death, it is interesting to look at, but apart from that there were no other deep points brought to light that had not already been thought of in the first two movies - and only one of them was actually mentioned. The final words were very apt for the movie, but I am still somewhat disappointed -- maybe that is just because I didn't want it to end. Part of me is still stuck in the fantasy world of the matrix, and I doubt I will ever escape it."

","Occasionally a sci-fi thriller fails to produce an intriguing plot line or an original fantasy premise, but succeeds on the basis of simply being a good war movie (""Aliens"" comes to mind.) This film fails to do even that, although it has some strong performances by supporting cast members: Mary Alice is excellent as the oracle, Jada Pinkett Smith is persuasive as the gung-ho combat pilot, Nona Gaye and others are good as ordinary citizens caught up in the drama of war. On the other hand, the lead actors are uninspired; Keanu Reeves does his usual dazed and clueless routine, Lawrence Fishburne doesn't have much to work with in the script.<br/><br/>The computer-animated battle scenes are boring, for the simple reason that there is too much going on, too fast, on the screen, and it becomes a blur. The sentinel machines are similar to Doc Ock in ""Spiderman 2,"" but in that film the effects were far more engaging, because they were slow enough and detailed enough to follow. And compare the exo-fighting machines in this film, which are pretty lame, to the terrific fight scene in ""Aliens,"" where Sigourney Weaver straps into the exo-fork lift and dukes it out with the creature -- that shows you what can be done."

","Besides giving us new great special effects and bringing a really unique story to the screen which seldomly happens with blockbuster movies, the wachowski bros succeeded in one thing: dividing the whole astonished audience after part one with the second and third part. Of course everybodys taste is different but when you look at other triologies you wont find such a divided fanbase like the matrix'one. <br/><br/>The problems of revolutions is just plain and simple: its boring. and Its hard to understand unless you consider yourself a real hardcore fan and start to invest hours to figure out what for instance the train station stands for - if it was meant to have a deeper meaning at all. the action scenes aren't as close as fascinating as those in the first part - which, in fact, is caused by the fact that no one has seen similar things on screens before, but even the action scenes in the second part were better - to be honest most of the action in revolutions was almost annoying, a stupid repetition of boring shooting scenes, bullet time and huge special effects which intents were simply to impress. And besides the hardly understandable story in the third part, leaving the audience looking for deeper meanings and metaphors where probably aren't any, this is the point i'm criticizing the most: while the wachowskis were using neverseen special effects in part one not only to impress - and boy what were we all - but also to 'tell a story', they used them in the third part mostly unnecessary. Like to tell us: Look , we can top the action and the f/x of the first two parts. <br/><br/>What the movie also makes more worse are the dialogues. Reloaded gave us bunch of silly dialogues and, ironically although did not wanting to top this, revolutions does it. Lastly, i have to state : this is my opinion, and therefore other people have others. But opinions are never wrong - they can base on facts which are judged and viewed by everybody different. but: replying a bad review with the words 'if you're such a wisecrack - do it better' is just poor. Nobody has to be better than someone else to criticize his work, otherwise there wouldn't be almost no criticism at all, but you have to have some arguments. sometimes i see people so excited by a movie or whatever they really take bad reviews as a personal offense."

","This is better. Much better. Since the Matrix Reloaded never made any attempt at a conclusion (even a temporary conclusion such as those found in Kill Bill or Lord of the Rings), it ended in a slump. And that's exactly where this film starts off. In fact the first half hour is the weakest of the trilogy, as the Wachowski's try to work out what feels like a recycled part of the last film, the conclusion that never was. Here, we are forced to endure another horrific encounter with the Merovingian (though thankfully, not nearly as long), a lobby scene sequence that is pathetic after the action we have seen in the first two films, a useless subplot involving the Trainman, and Neo trapped in Mobil (Limbo) station. This is weak, very weak. But once the film gets past it, it takes on a new life. And the results are fantastic. The Wachowskis, having decided that more is better should be the motto of the second Matrix, take a daring, dangerous, and entirely original way with this one. After the first half hour, there is no Matrix scene until the conclusive battle between Neo and Smith. Thus there is none of the mind-bending, gravity-defying action, either. And none of the philosophic pontificating that marred the second film. This takes place almost entirely in the Real World, and, though a daring move, it is a successful one. The characters take on more life here. Indeed, one could even go so far as to say they do some acting. In this film, Neo and Trinity's relationship for the first time becomes something other than a plot gimmick, and there are actually moments of chemistry. Morpheus, though a side-seat driver for the entire film, gains much more humanity after his disillusionment (it also helps that there are not philosophy lectures for him to recite.) Many of the lesser characters are rendered in three-dimensions this time (the captain of the Hammer, Niobe, Link). As for the Oracle, the sudden cast change after the death of the first one for this film does not hurt it at all. In fact, this new Oracle is much more compelling than the original, and (partially because she has a much bigger role), is the one I now think of when I think of the Matrix. First prize still has to go to Hugo Weaving, who continues his transformation in the form of Smith to diabolical levels. He is exaggerated and overplayed, in a manner that is totally successful (one is reminded of Jack Nicholson). HIs twisted sense of humour is now in perfect balance with his cold, machine like evil. Also remarkable is the actor who portrays Bane, a human occupied by Smith. He renders Hugo Weaving's mannerisms so perfectly, one thinks it is Hugo Weaving in disguise (it might be, I haven't checked.) As for the action, it is amazing. The Battle for the Docks is something completely new, and absolutely terrifying. Indeed, (and as a huge Lord of the Rings fan, this is saying something), it is comparable in adrenaline-activity to the Battle of Pelennor Fields. 250,000 sentinels turn the battleground into a nightmare apocalyptic vision. As for Neo and Trinity, there quest to the Machine City is equally fascinating, showing the surface world we have only seen briefly as another nightmare. THere is even a moment of actual poetry in which, bursting above the clouds, Trinity becomes the first human in 100 years to see the sky. The Machine City itself is something like Dr. Seuss on acid, and the Deus Ex Machina is a rather scary version of the Head of Oz. As for the final apocalyptic fight between Neo and Smith, it is just that. The effects of the rain are magnificent as the two Titans clash far above the earth. And the actual conclusion to the story, something that I had no idea how the Wachowskis would bring about after the second one, is actually pretty surprising and rather clever. All this being said, there are still flaws. The battle between Smith and Neo is great until it crashes into the ground (literally), after which, the momentum is lost, and the final effect is rather awkward. There are still horrible lines, but thankfully, most of them are just one or two lines, instead of entire dialogues. The actual ending of the film leaves something to be desired, a sunset happy-go-lucky meeting that seems to come more from Harry Potter than the Matrix. But, flaws aside, this is a much better film than Reloaded, and though no where near the masterpiece of the original, is still a worthy successor."

","The Matrix Revolutions, the third part of Andy and Larry Wachowski's Matrix trilogy, fittingly ends what will be considered in the near future as one of cinema's classic trilogies. Though this third outing into the Matrix universe is the weakest of the three films, it's still an outstanding film with a great ending. Unlike part 2, this film has character development giving the main characters (Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, as well as new characters Link and Niobe) something to do with their characters. Although I am disappointed that most of the film doesn't take place in the Matrix itself, if you look at the structure of the trilogy, it does make sense and I respect the Wachowskis for sticking with their vision even if they did alienate some of their core audience. Again, Don Davis' score is superb (not as good as Reloaded's score but nearly up there and definitely better than his first Matrix score). This is a fitting 7 out of 10 and a must-see, if only to see how the Matrix trilogy ends."

","Picking up right we left in Reloaded, the machines are about to breach upon Zion, Neo is in a mysterious coma stuck between the matrix and the real world, Zion's defenses are being prepared, and finally Bane awakens; but in a very hostile manner. When Neo awakens too, he realises that he has to confront the source of the matrix and finally confront Agent Smith if Zion and all the people to survive. While he and Trinity both go to the Machine City, the others; Morpheus, Link, Niobi and the crew of the Hammer go back to Zion to help its defenses. Inside the dock of Zion, its an all out war. The machine diggers have breached the walls and thousands of sentinels are ready to kill all its inhabitants.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions is an all out action packed, visually amazing climatic conclusion to the matrix trilogy. The war of Zion is just amazing, the sentinels moving together as one being is just a sight to see. The action just keeps coming at a relentless pace. The chase of The Hammer ship being crawled over by hundreds of sentinels is also an amazing sequence. The Machine City is so detailed and has a real haunting presence with all the blue hues. The highlight of the film which everyone was waiting for is the final explosive showdown between Neo and Smith. While its a fight to remember, the only annoying part of the fight is when Neo and Smith start fighting in the sky and start flying around the place. It really took away from the intensity and over all impact of the fight.<br/><br/>The visual effects are flawless, they are just so integrated that its hard to pick faults in them. Yet they do take away from the story. All the action and effects side step the narrative, making the plotting confusing at times. The fighting has also seem to lost that nobility from the first matrix, going for more style, losing that emotional core. The acting from everyone is very good, though abit over acted in places, but overall very good from all people. One part that didn't really need explaining though was the change in actor for The Oracle. Mary Alice who took over the role when Gloria Foster sadly died. It seemed pointless that they needed to explain why she looked different, adding confusion unless you've played the matrix game.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions is a great conclusion to this trilogy and will become a sci-fi classic in the years to come."

","""It is inevitable."" The final installment of ""The Matrix"" has the power of any ending to a trilogy.

Hugo Weaving is the stand-out performance of the movie. Of course, Keanu Reeves continues his reign of a good actor since 1993 with his powerful expressions and the flare he adds to his every move. The entire cast is at its supremest, which is essentially the purpose for why this film affects me as much as it does. The effects are still ones to be marveled over, though one can't help but miss the usual ""I know Kung Fu"" battles. The final fight is undoubtedly the most powerful one.<br/><br/>Back to Weaving; he delivers such a performance that you feel ashamed to like him because of how evil he is. He's the guilty pleasure villain that is an absolute pleasure to watch with wonderment. Overall, all is powerful in the all powerful ""Matrix."""

","The Matrix was good. It had a fair amount of innovative effects put to good use on an interesting plot. It even had an inhabited virtual world. With Reloaded and Revolutions two things went wrong. The effects were less convincing, even though Smith was a load of fun, and there were practically no people in the virtual world - only Smiths, cars and buildings. Where's the fun in that? As for effects; sometimes they degraded to computer game quality - for instance: When Neo fought single opponents you could see him breathe and even lose his breath (poor physical condition would show more when fighting a zillion suits, wouldn't it?). In scenes where he fought many opponents and in particular Smith & Co., he was completely void of expression as was his opponents. He even lacked the poor shave otherwise characterizing his character. Talk about effects standing out like the proverbial thumb. Oh, and I haven't even mentioned the completely ridiculous massive effect overload in the war scenes - please! Following up on The Matrix should've been forbidden by higher powers. And watching the trilogy in one sitting doesn't add to the positives, I might add."

","Well, after a brilliant start and a quite disappointing sequel, the third one could do one of two things: make it better, or make it worse. Make an impressive ending, putting the second part into perspective. Or make a cheesy, unimaginative ending, and let it all go down the gutter.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Wachowski's did the latter. Oh, where to begin. With the first one being a quite intelligent film, and the second one just a dumb action flick, they actually managed to undercut ""Reloaded"". Oh yes sir, they did.<br/><br/>This part is (again, alas) a simple ""good guys vs. bad guys"" action flick. The ""heavily outnumbered heroes against certain end of humanity"" aspect was strong, too, and emphasised just a bit too much. Nothing new here. In other words: I was bored. *Yawn*.<br/><br/>The special effects: again nice, but nothing new, either. The whole thing is a seamless continuation of the second part. It looks and feels much the same. Someone clearly ran out of ideas here.<br/><br/>The worst part of this film, however, is it's ending. It is cheesy. It is corny. It is boring. I sat there in the cinema, thinking 'What? That's *it*? Come on, you have to be f***ing kidding me here!'. The first part definitely did not deserve this. So not all that starts well ends well, too.

","The Matrix Revolutions is the mildly disappointing finale to the excellent Matrix trilogy. The film is about Neo seeking to fulfill his task as the One and the citizens of Zion (the secret human city in the Real World) defending their home against an onslaught of Sentinals.<br/><br/>The film's opening is extremely engaging and action-packed. Morpheus, Link, and Trinity have discovered that Neo is somehow jacked into the Matrix, despite the fact that he is not connected via the head-plug. Morpheus and Trinity enter the Matrix to find Neo and rescue him from wherever he is. They fight through a club to speak with the Merovingian, who, according to the Oracle, knows where Neo is. They persuade him to tell them where Neo is, and they save him.<br/><br/>Following this opening sequence, the film is, unlike the other Matrix films, mostly a war film, since the majority of the film documents the battle between Zion and the Sentinals. The battle gets repetitive, but is fairly fun to watch, especially near the end.<br/><br/>The film's finale falls short of expectations, in my opinion. I won't spoil it for you... so suffice it to say it's like eating a 10-layer Tootsie Pop, each layer better than the last, until you finally get to the delicious chocolatey center, only to discover it's not there. To fully understand the film's ending, you need to re-view it at least once... I had to re-view it twice before I fully understood exactly what had happened.<br/><br/>The film has great acting and a great plot, but the visual effects seem somehow cheesier than Reloaded's effects (I think WB may have pulled some of Revolution's funding after it considered Reloaded a letdown). Also, a certain emotional scene towards the end of the film involving Neo and Trinity goes on FOREVER, never ceasing to pester you with its badly scripted dialouge (the only scene with bad dialouge). Otherwise, the film is great.<br/><br/>So, in summary, Revolutions is a good film that, with a few tweaks, could have been a great film. Definitely worth a rental, and if you've already seen Reloaded, you should see Revolutions to find out what happens next.<br/><br/>7/10 from zero-hour-ii"

"nathan-254","4","0","0","28 October 2005"," Philosophy yeah right
","SPOILERS Different people like different things in films, no doubt. Some loved the Matrix for its mind bending action, others for its dabbling in what a lot of people are calling ""philosophy"". The question with all films is how well the film realises and balances the elements. I felt the original was slightly overrated (though good), because I'm not the type to be impressed by flashy effects alone. But the plot of the Matrix was amazing and intriguing, which is what kept me interested, though even in the case of this film I was disappointed that too much time was given to un-engaging action sequences. I like action sequences with a bit of tension and drama, but even M1 only offered this on a few occasions, particularly as the main character just failed to encourage empathy or demonstrate any humanity. I would have preferred edgy realistic fights not comic book set pieces where characters walk on the ceiling in slow mo. Not enough time was given to the kind of scenes where characters rush to points where they can jack out of the matrix, with agents on their trail, or to little touches like the deja vu cat. Despite this it was the concept of MAtrix which makes it so memorable.<br/><br/>Reloaded was an improvement in some ways but not in others. The balance and logic between the action and the ""philosophising"" was much worse, which made the film contrived. The formula was clear: sections of dialogue followed by action set pieces. The formulaic one on one fight scenes, where adversaries face each other down, are even more phony looking as soon as matrix powers get used. They also become more and more predictable as Neo becomes more and more powerful. The effects are actually quite poor in the ""kung fu"" scenes, with the combatants often looking no more realistic than puppets. The tedious fight of Neo against thousands of pixillated playstation 2 Smiths gave the whole film a faintly ridiculous feel.<br/><br/>On the upside some of the action within the Matrix Reloaded was a bit engaging such as the car chase, and those who enjoy the ""philosophy"" are satisfied by extensions of the plot and new questions raised. I find it a real shame though that the idea of an actual story in a sci fi film is seen by some reviewers as ""philosophising"", either as a negative or positive criticism. It's because of morons like this that the actual story of Reloaded had to be kept safely boxed up in neat little scenes and not allowed to get in the way of pointless and utterly predictable action. I like the filmwork used to show the differences between the real world, the Matrix, and various other off shoots of it and the eerie impression given. It was a shame so little time was given to these parts focusing on intrigue within the Matrix and new interesting characters like the Frenchman. But the introduction of action in the real world was satisfying, and some attempts at characterisation were commendable if largely unsuccessful.<br/><br/>Revolutions, by this token, is a terrible anticlimax. The lovers of cartoon action sequences will prefer this to the last one, but none of the plot questions are resolved. Instead of the thriller template of the previous two, we now have a semi-biblical war film which does little to stretch the imagination. I'm not one to rubbish a sequel for venturing in to new generic territory, but very few sequels carry out this transition smoothly. The question must be asked: why dispense with what gave the first one its trendy originality and replace it with run of the mill fare? The effects were unconvincing and cartoony, the characters uncompelling, wooden and often a little surplus to requirements. The sets also gave Zion a T.V feel. The entire battle was far fetched. What was the point of the walkers? If humans could construct these walkers of dubious military value, why not just build weapons instead and have them controlled from a safer position? And is that not the world's stupidest design for a war vehicle, with the driver expose at the front?! The opportunity is not taken to further explore the more interesting themes of the trilogy, and though the ending is quite surprising, it is rushed and augmented by another phony battle with agent Smith, itself tipped off by lame dialogue.<br/><br/>The only scenes I liked were the train man scene and the scene with Smith and the oracle. It really annoys me the way the directors kept these scenes bottled up, so that they really only added more questions. The suspicion is now of a thinly devised subplot which can only be alluded to to create a sense of mystery. Neo's conversation with the oracle is now unenlightening and somewhat lazy I felt. To resolve the trilogy the quasi-religious imagery is drawn heavily on, supported by meaningless mumbo-jumbo about balancing equations. There are no further twists and no satisfactory resolution."
"Monotreme02","3","0","0","27 October 2005"," Doesn't live up to the first Matrix
","The third and hopefully final installment in The Matrix franchise, The Matrix Revolutions has been receiving more hype than any other movie this year, starting with the worldwide release stunt, which was quite odd yet effective (The movie grossed $44 million worldwide on the first day).<br/><br/>The plot is basically this: The freed humans are working as hard as they can to protect Zion from the upcoming machine attack. We witness about half an hour of non-stop fighting, as the humans attempt to fend off the hundreds of thousands of Sentinels the machines sent to destroy Zion. In the meantime, we jump back to the events in The Matrix Reloaded, when two hover-crafts are sent to rescue the Nebuchadnezzar. At the end of Reloaded we learned that the Nebuchadnezzar was destroyed, and it's The Hammer rescued crew. In Revolutions the Hammer sets out to rescue the Logos, captained by Niobe. After again consulting The Oracle, Neo finally realizes what he must do. He must reach the machine city in order to stop the war. Neo and Trinity take the Logos to the machine city, while the rest remain on the Hammer and attempt to return to Zion before the machine army gets there. Agent Smith has a much bigger part in this movie than in Reloaded, as he replaces the machines as the main villain. In an attempt to prevent Smith from destroying the real world, the machines aid Neo in a final showdown between him and Smith.<br/><br/>Here's my theory. There are three things that make a Matrix movie:<br/><br/>1) Meaning behind the words, philosophical discussions, witty dialog, elements that make you think. The first movie was full of this stuff, which is one of the things that made it great. I think that Reloaded tried TOO hard to add philosophical meaning, which is what made it less great than the first. Also, Reloaded attempted to include too much witty dialog, which in some cases (such as the Merovingian's speech about causality) is completely irrelevant to the story. Revolutions, though, had no meaning at all. It just continued what Reloaded said about the war between freedom of choice and fate, but Revolutions didn't add anything new to the philosophy of the Matrix, which is one aspect that made it weak.<br/><br/>2) Plot, character development, etc. Once again, the first Matrix gets top marks here. While Reloaded had a storyline, it was neither as extensive nor as interesting as the original Matrix. One of the strong points in Reloaded though is the addition of many new characters. Revolutions has even less of a storyline then Reloaded had, which again, made it a weaker movie.<br/><br/>3) Insane action sequences. The shootout in the building in the first Matrix, or the first time we are introduced to bullet time, are sequences that will never be forgotten. They added a whole new aspect to the definition of ""action"". And because that the action takes place in The Matrix, the people can do impossible things, which makes it all the more interesting to watch. Now I must say, in this factor Reloaded almost passes the original Matrix. The Burly Brawl (battle against 100 Agent Smiths) is an unforgettable scene, and the car chase on the freeway might be the greatest car chase in any movie. In Revolutions though, the only taste of Matrix action we get is a tiny sequence in the beginning, when Trinity, Morpheus and Seraph duke it out against some of the Merovingian's goons. The only other time we witness Matrix action in Revolutions is the final showdown between Neo and Smith, which I personally thought, compared to the first two movies, was weak, slow and didn't leave enough of an impact. The other major action sequence in Revolutions is the battle in Zion. My problem with this is that it just wasn't... Matrix style. When I go to see a Matrix movie, I expect to see some insane impossible stunts and intense bung-fu scenes, not just another sci-fi war scene. The action was okay, but it just didn't live up to my standards of ""Matrix action"".<br/><br/>Watching Revolutions gave me an entire new level of appreciation towards Reloaded. I'm not sure why, but it did. Now I'm not saying that it was that bad a movie - I just personally felt that it didn't live up to the first Matrix. I, personally, was quite disappointed by The Matrix Revolutions. See it if you like the series, but lower your expectations first."

","Contrary to other comments on this site, and in agreement with the critical commentary found on the Ultimate Matrix Collection DVD, the battle for Zion should not be in this movie, at least not to the degree that it is.

The action is in-your-face, the symbolism is deep and enchanting - if you get it, which the majority of movie-goers do not, and that's the problem. One critic for Reloaded actually said, ""I want my action films dumb and stupid"" - which speaks for most of this film's Western audience. I recommend observing the Philosopher Commentaries of the 10-disc set DVD's mostly because they open up much of the hidden meanings of these films, and they show how 90% of the negative critics simply had no right to pass any kind of judgment.<br/><br/>See this trilogy.

","So here it is - the end of the trilogy, the final part of the Matrix-saga. And? Well, it's better than ""Reloaded"", but still a disappointment. Like ""Reloaded"", ""Revolutions"" has an overabundance of special effects, fighting scenes and action. There's plenty of lame one-liners, ridiculous pompous speeches, exaggerated situations, and actually quite bad acting. It feels like the directors put the actors/acting in the backseat so they could concentrate on blam-blam, kick-punch, fire-boom etc. Again, a big mistake. What makes ""Revolutions"" slightly better than ""Reloaded"" is that there is at least some kind of storyline going on, that isn't completely lost in fx etc. It progresses slowly, and is a lot weaker than in the first ""Matrix"", but at least there's a shred of effort here, probably just because they realized that they had to bring it all to an end. And that's what they do. Considering how strong ""Matrix"" was, and the material/storyline that was introduced there and that they had to base parts 2 & 3 on, they've done a lousy job continuing the tale. It could've been excellent all the way through, but isn't. Not by a long shot. I'm not gonna go into details about the story, poor acting and so on. If I did, this commentary would be a mile long.

I also found the ""new"" Oracle not as good as the original one, by far. After I watched ""Matrix reloaded"" I decided I would not go to the cinema to watch ""Matrix revolutions"". In fact, I got the DVD from a video-shop, just for one evening.

The ambiance and dramatic mood throughout the movie was a wise choice by the Wachowski brothers. Many of the un-answered questions that left you cliffhanging in the second are answered.

A 20 minute war scene between the robots and the humans might possibly be the most amazing thing you'll ever see sitting in a movie theater too. <br/><br/>But seriously, this movie was over-looked and didn't deserve enough respect that it should have.

","How can people say the storyline is bad? Of course, the Matrix had an excellent story.<br/><br/>However, I believe the storyline in Reloaded and Revolutions is much more interesting. Don't see them as separate movies, see it as a movie of 3.5 hours, with the most important scenes in Reloaded and the action in Revolutions.<br/><br/>The most important scenes are the conversation with the Architect, where Neo hears that the prophecy (and thus the first movie) is bullshit and just another mechanism of control of the machines over the 1% people who do not accept the matrix. Neo finds out that his search for being the one or not in the first movie is all plannes by the machines and he is number six to do the job. Now, facing the Architect, he has to reload the matrix for the seventh cycle, improving it with his knowledge of human imperfection in order to make the matrix more efficient and reduce resistance. <br/><br/>The second important scene is the beginning of matrix revolutions in which Neo talks to the oracle and when she is (voluntary) taken over by Smith. The Oracle was originally created by the architect in order to guide the one to the source and reload the matrix again. However, after 5 rounds the oracle wanted something different and she guided the sixth one, Neo, in another way (with love and so on) in order for him to choose the other door in the Architects room (a choice that the architect did not expect and did certainly not hope). By changing Neo, the Oracle also gave incredible powers to Smith, using him to achieve peace. Ans about the end, it was not strange or senseless how Neo destroyed Smith. In fact, Neo didn't, the computer mainframe did. Neo heard the Oracle talking through Smith (he called him Neo, something he would normally never do) and Neo understands it is the Oracle making her last move to peace. Neo lets Smith take him, and now Smith has no purpose anymore. He is now deleted by the matrix since when he took Neo he was again plugged in the system. <br/><br/>I don't understand why so many people were sick of this 'vague and meaningless philosophical' talk of the Oracle. She plays the most important role in the trilogy, making sure the matrix does not get reloaded. She is responsible for the revolution and uses Smith by making him so dangerous that he will even survive over the machines. Now Neo is the only hope.<br/><br/>I don't see the problem with this, it is a great story.<br/><br/>The only shame, it is ripped of by the science fiction film Dark City in which John is Neo, the strangers are the machines, and Dokter Schreber is the oracle."

I personally didn't think it lived up to the old one, but I based my vote on the movie. If you take this movie and watch it as if its the first of the series, like there was no other Matrix movie, you would probably like it. It is a bit slow at times, and the acting is just OKAY.

And, as a matter of fact, they got it. But did anyone take notice of it? No! Why? Simple. Because there wasn't enough ""action"". Am I missing something? Fair enough, the ending has all the passion and finesse of a one legged duck holding a toilet brush. But aside from that; what was the big problem? People mostly complain about the film being rushed, and fair play to them it was. But does that mean that the storyline has suffered dramatically? The only major reason that I can think of to explain people's distaste to this film is the simple fact that they do not understand it. Now, with all honesty, I too believe that the plot and tone of this film would feel more at home in an episode of a gardening show hosted by some washed up 80's actor who hasn't worked for years and mostly lives on a healthy diet of Big Macs and toe nail clippings. But nevertheless the story is compelling and near impossible to turn away from until you can just catch a grasp of the meaning before it is ultimately pulled away from your clutches. This is the reason why many people turn back to this film with enjoyment and love for the work put into it. It might look like The Wachowski Brothers ran through this film faster than curry and lager run through you on a Sunday morning, giving us the main reason as to why the story makes almost no sense whatsoever! But no, the reason why it is so complicated is why it is so beautiful... The reason for the bad ending is to divert us from the real questions: What really is The Matrix? Is Neo only one of a kind? Did the creator of the Matrix merely lie to Neo to catch him off guard? Do the machines really know what is going on? When a Sentinel appears on screen, why do I always have the urge to go buy some Calamari? All in all, the movie isn't rushed, in fact it is cleverly designed to make us believe the uncertainties.

","Double review - Matrix Reloaded & Revolutions <br/><br/>I might as well warn you now, this may turn into a rant about sequels so if you are interested in a review I can give it to you now. It's shocking. Don't see it. And if possible avoid the second film too, unless it's too late.<br/><br/>Sequels have in some respect been the bane of my film-watching life. Whenever I see Babe, The Lion King, The Matrix or even Raiders of the Lost Ark I am dumbfounded by the lack of imagination or thought that went into these money-making flops. There are some sequels that aren't truly awful - just slightly - because the original film was so bad anyway. I'm thinking of Superbabies or whatever it was called. The worst sort of sequel is the bad sequel to a classic film. The Matrix was a classic sci-fi and raised several interesting philosophical questions. It left some open ends which is good because it lets your imagination take you someplace without having to have extra facts shoved down your throat. The second two films were either confused or they just ignored the philosophy. And on the action scene they weren't particularly good either. The second film's fight scenes were impressive but overlong and belief was completely suspended, which didn't happen in the first film. The car chase was, again, impressive for a time, but it was overlong and all hype about the best car chase ever were by no means justified - that honour goes to Ronin in my opinion. The third film was just ridiculous. They cut out the questions, they cut out the martial arts - what's left? CGI and guns. In the final scenes Neo and Agent Smith(s) have a large fight that seems to last for 20 minutes - it probably does but I wouldn't want to sit through it again - and it consists of the two parties slamming into each other repeatedly and bouncing off each other like Teletubbies. It is interminable. The storyline makes no sense and doesn't keep you engaged.<br/><br/>The second film does have some redeeming features, for example I enjoyed the Agent Smiths fight. I would be prepared to give this a 4 out of 10 and the third film a 2 out of 10. However I'll give them each one out of ten because they completely ruined the first film for me. It's not fair and it's not objective. All I can say is, if you don't like sequels in general these definitely aren't for you. Stick to the brilliance of the first film. And if you do have a soft spot for sequels you still won't enjoy these films. And your brain should be dissected. I will never understand the relatively high rating that this gets compared to a masterwork like Speed 2 or the Power Rangers series."

At this point, Trinity and Neo are off to machine city to strike a deal to get rid of Smith, while Niobe and the rest of the remaining rebels make their way back to Zion to assist in its defense. <br/><br/>After that little scene, we wisely get back to Trinity and Neo. At this point you'll probably be suffering from Matrix starvation: the Wachowskis seem to think the Matrix irrelevant at this point, and try to prop you comfortably in a place you've only briefly been in during Reloaded. This tactic really backfires, as we do not enter the Matrix for a good 40 minutes at least.<br/><br/>And we do, it is both exhilarating and disappointing. The final battle between Smith and Neo is a thing of wonder, but no where near as powerful as the subway battle in the first Matrix. And that was much longer then this, which ends about 7 minutes in. <br/><br/>After that, a resolution is brought upon us, and we are treated to a sugar coated faith ending.<br/><br/>So, to summarize, nothing new, just OK, not as good as the first one or the second. <br/><br/>You'd probably be better off watching all the movies in reverse."

","I liked this thoughtful and challenging trilogy. But I initially left the cinema disappointed, and after reading some of the comments on IMDb, so did a lot of other people. BUT... 2 days later I realised that this was a blockbuster where no one ""got the girl""; the Hero dies and does NOT save the day. And yes I am talking about matrix:revolutions. This movie, and the whole trilogy, is brilliantly narcissistic.<br/><br/>Consider the plot of the trilogy for a moment. The machines have a problem: they can't keep the people in the pods, they keep trying to make a matrix that satisfies and controls the pod people. All we are watching is one of many 'development' cycles of the biggest bit of software EVER - bigger than Gates can ever imagine. CRITIC:""Ah, but the Zionists.."" There are a million ways the machines control the Zionists; they rely on a machine (the Zion mainframe) for their very survival, for one.<br/><br/>I liked this movie even though I left the cinema disappointed. OK, its drawn out and panders to a 'die hard' audience. But it manages to be intellectual at the same time (don't get me wrong - I love die hard).<br/><br/>watch it again and root for the machines this time and you'll see a better movie!"

","WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW:<br/><br/>I have to say, that I really like this movie. I don't necessarily love it but at the same time, it gets lots more playtime in my DVD player than Reloaded does. I've heard a lot of complaints about this film but I feel that it is the better of the two sequels for multiple reasons, even if it is still flawed in some ways. Wanna hear why? In keeping with the style of my review for Reloaded, here's my three point breakdown:<br/><br/>THINGS THAT REALLY SUCKED ABOUT THIS MOVIE:<br/><br/><ul><li>No Gloria Foster. No matter how you cut it, the fact that she's gone just flat out sucks. Mary Alice does a great job in filling the role but the fact that the change is never explained in a satisfying way definitely hurts the movie. - Sati, the little Indian kid. I always feel bad when criticizing the performance of a child in a film but let's face it, she just wasn't that good. Cute but... no. - Trinity's Goodbye Speech. The filmmakers should have realized that this was going on a bit too long. When you're secretly wishing for one of the story's main characters to die so they can shut their trap already, that isn't a very good thing. - Morpheus becoming little more than a supporting character. What does he do in this movie? A lot less than he does in Reloaded, that's what. - Some more wooden acting. Again, I am not naming names.</li></ul><br/><br/>THINGS THAT KINDA SUCKED BUT WERE ALSO KIND OF COOL:<br/><br/><ul><li>The Superbrawl between Neo and Smith. This is a pretty interesting two sided coin we have here. The movie simultaneously gives you a fight that the makers of the next Superman will have to work pretty hard to top and also ends up dragging it out a little longer than it needed to be. It reaches a certain point where you just want it to end already and being that this is probably the most important moment of the movie, it is kind of disappointing to feel that way when you shouldn't. - Not having all of your questions answered by the end. They managed to tie up the trilogy in a satisfying way more or less, but I was still left scratching my head afterwards when it came to certain questions I had. I'm not going to waste space listing them all but if you want an example of one such question, I'd really like to know what the hell that was all about when the ghost of that Sentinel went through Neo while he and Trinity were heading to the Machine City? Hello? Anybody? While I don't think it's absolutely necessary to answer EVERY question in a movie, this one seemed to leave one loose end too many. - Neo losing his sight by way of a severed electrical cable. I have mixed feelings about this and it does suck but not necessarily in a bad way. It doesn't suck in that it was executed poorly or something like that but it sucks in that it is one of the most horrifying things I have ever seen happen to someone in a movie and it happens to the hero of the film. Losing my eyesight is one of my biggest fears and this just disturbed me to no end. I'm not docking the movie any rating points for this but I just had to bring it up because it is one of the things that stick out the most for me when I recount the movie. It's a great scene but it's the one moment in the movie where I really felt for Neo. From that moment on, you know that it isn't going to end happily for everyone in general. It just sucks in that way that it does when a film's protagonist gets injured really badly. Like Boromir at the end of Fellowhip of the Rings. - Not enough events taking place in the Matrix. I would've liked to see more stuff happen within the lovely green tinted world of the Matrix but then again, the important thing in the story really is the fight of the Zion inhabitants to survive, so I guess I can deal with the fact that most of this film takes place in the real world. - Lobby Shootout Part Two. Think of the Lobby Shootout from the first one but instead of SWAT guys, you have S&amp;M club bouncers running along the ceiling letting off shots. You somehow get the sense that they were trying to update and top the shootout from the first Matrix but it doesn't quite work. It's a cool scene but suffers from being in the shadow of the original. - The Kid/ Clayton Watson. He wasn't grating as he was in Reloaded but I was kind of led to believe that this guy was going to have some major role to play in the film due to the fact that he got his own story in the Animatrix. Something about the way his role was set up in the film distracted me a little bit. I wasn't exactly sure what to make of him but at least he came through when they needed him most. </li></ul><br/><br/>THINGS THAT WERE REALLY COOL ABOUT THIS MOVIE:<br/><br/><ul><li>Seraph/ Collin Chou. Yeah, he makes his first appearance in Reloaded but I thought he really shined here. - Neo in the Machine City. Everything from getting there to his meeting with the machine leader. The whole idea of that scene was pretty cool and it's interesting to see the conflict from the side of the ""enemy"" for a moment. - Smith/ Hugo Weaving. I don't really need to go into why, do I? - The attack on Zion. Exhausting to watch? Sure. Entertaining? You bet. Robot suits, machine guns, screaming, explosions, savagery committed by machines and humans alike, it's all here. My favorite moment: The ""Hand of God"" scene where that rush of Sentinels spills out of the hole from the ceiling of the dock, becoming a massive force of destruction. Still gets me every time. - Bane/ Ian Bliss. His impersonation of Hugo Weaving is one of the best things about the movie. You have to give this guy his props for his work here. - The Flight of the Hammer. This scene is awesome and easily Jada Pinkett Smith's best moment in the two sequels. - Neodammerung, the music that played over the Superbrawl. I think it compliments the on screen action really well. - Lock/ Harry Lennix. Very good performance. You gotta love an actor who can make you genuinely hate him. - The overall sense of defeat that grows and grows through the movie. I love movies that are kind of depressing to watch like this one is. You know while watching this movie that you're not going to get a perfect, happy ending. What were they gonna do, free everyone from the Matrix and live under a nice, dark sky without the Machines bothering them? I'm glad that didn't happen because if it did, this movie would've sucked big time. I liked the fact that the Wachowskis weren't afraid to cave in to the Hollywood standard of happy endings with no strings. - That moment where Trinity sees the unclouded sky for the first time. It's the one moment of the movie that really gives you the message of the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>CONCLUSION:<br/><br/>A fitting end to the trilogy, even though we all wished, maybe unreasonably, for cinematic perfection. I like this movie for many different reasons and though I wish that the entire trilogy lived up to the standard set by the first, it still managed to be a very inventive and entertaining series. I feel that Revolutions succeeds, especially in its dumping of all the boring psychobabble that weighed Reloaded down in favor of the goods. A somewhat anticlimactic ending and some crappy acting keep the movie from being better than it could've been but not by much. In it's defense, it feels like a more complete movie then Reloaded does, regardless of it being one half of a big movie split down the middle. <br/><br/>I would actually like to see another Matrix trilogy at some point in the future. I'm pretty sure with the advance of technology in films today that they can expand the world of the Matrix and make it even richer. Lastly, I think the sequels need to be seen at least twice to be able to appreciate them at all. <br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of *****."

","This movie, along with Reloaded looks to have been an afterthought of the original matrix... oddly it is not. Matrix 1, 2, and 3 were all written one right after another, and initially pitched as one giant story. I find this mind boggling due to the fact that #1 almost sums up an entire story, and 2 and 3 hang on as if a last ditch effort to preserve the aura which obviously is failing. There was HUGE hype around the original, and for good reason, but 2 had less and 3 almost none.<br/><br/>Someone commented on here that the hacker image had been replaced by bondage etc. I agree. The original came out during a time where computers and computer phenomenon was at its apogee, and that is what helped to build the matrix; RELATION. On 2 and 3, people found it hard to relate to such a story. Instead of going on the original story, we are bombarded with an over-complication of philosophy bordering on religious symbols. They tried to make it TOO complicated, TOO deep, TOO twisty for the masses to really relate to it.<br/><br/>I have never, ever, seen such a wonderful idea go down in flames like the Matrix has. I honestly feel deep sorrow for such a waste of one of the most beautiful settings for a story ever created..."

","After waiting a long time and forgetting the details of the Matrix and Reloaded (and hence not worrying about the many unanswered questions or new characters), I found I just enjoyed it as a big dumb actioner, with a bit of a unique flavour.<br/><br/>The first hour of Revolutions plods a bit, like Reloaded, wasting time on irrelevancies like the train station. So there's an easy half hour to trim (Reloaded was bulging with similar scenes). This prevents the movie from achieving any kind of greatness.<br/><br/>Perhaps if Reloaded and Revolutions had been edited tightly as one movie, it could have been great. Instead we got one mediocre and one half decent movie. <br/><br/>One little quibble with the effects: the tracers from the machine guns (hehe) were too perfectly straight and consistent. This made it look artificial to me, especially when they were all shooting at the hole in the roof, but in closeup the guns looked more convincing and cool.<br/><br/>All in all, fun, but forgettable.

","::Spoilers Possible::<br/><br/>Of course hind-sight is always 20/20.  But, the Matrix Trilogy would have been better suited to stay with just the first movie at best, or acceptably the first two movies.  In fact, I would have rather been left with the cliffhanger and terrible ending at the end of Matrix Reloaded than seen this movie. The Matrix was a great movie that had an intriguing plot and great action that was all incorporated together expertly.  The second matrix movie had amazing action that was kind of woven together in an average to above average manner.  Matrix Revolutions has a boring plot and less intersting action than the first two with the exception of the fight between Neo and agent Smith in the rain.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the entire movie was action and no substance but the action was boring.  How exciting is shooting machine guns at a ceiling of Sentinels for and hour?  Not very in my book.  The only spirited fight is that between Neo and Agent Smith.  Also, the only decent acting is provided by Hugo Weaving.  Laurence Fishburne seems not to care about the series anymore.  Reeves no longer looks average because he can't look confused anymore.  Bad acting pretty much all around.  And (SPOILER) the death scene of Trinity actually takes what seems like hours.  But wait, he could save her life from being shot in the heart with a bullett, why not being stabbed with a steel rod?  I know he isn't in the matrix anymore, but he can still do all of his other stuff. Anyway, she takes years to die and the people in the theater that i was in stood up and cheared when she died.

","When I came out of the cinema I was so angry, because these were the 3 worst spend hours of my life. Before i went into the cinema I thought that this movie should have had a complete different storyline. I was happy to read here that at least one other commenter thought it should have been a matrix inside a matrix. That would have been much stronger. To me this was the only way it made sense, that Neo could sense the sentinels in the end of Reloaded. The ugly and hard machine world could also be a good excuse for 'people' to return to the matrix inside the matrix instead of trying to escape from the total matrix.<br/><br/>But unfortunately this movie threw all the new insights from reloaded overboard and started a complete nonsense story. The producers probably never understood why the first matrix was such a success: it was a difficult concept which was explained very clearly to the audience with a lot of patience. And it was great fun to relate the events during the life in the matrix world to the ""computerworld"" as we know it. Furthermore, it was exciting because the major characters were on a mission which was dangerous. Add that to spectacular cult like actions scenes and one of the greatest movies ever was created.<br/><br/>Reloaded already threw the suspense away, but introduced some new intriguing facts, which were not clearly explained. That opened up a big opportunity to the third part and increased expectations. <br/><br/>But this last movie was so full of holes and story lines which were completely incomprehensible. So now we have an audience who tries to guess what everything could mean and we end up with dozens of different explanations. I just think that the producers didn't have a clue either about what the story should mean. <br/><br/>But what bothered me really, was that the movie was nowhere exciting. Neo had gained biblical power so all these fights with Smith were kind of boring, while i couldn't care less about the cavemen in Zion. The invasion of Zion was so illogically. Robot fighters which have to be reloaded manually????? No protection for the pilots. Sentinels can be destroyed by EMP's, bot 'oops' we forgot to install this weapon at our basis.<br/><br/>Was there really anyone who followed the philosophical chitchat from the Oracle while watching the movie for the first time in the cinema? And what happened to all the things from Relaoded, like the keymaker etc? And how can this ""limbo"" status be related to what we have seen from the first 2 matrix movies? <br/><br/>I rate this movie 1/10"

","I suspected after Reloaded that the Wachowski Brothers, while creative, were not particularly good writers, and this suspicion is confirmed in the muddled Revolutions. To be fair they did hit the nail on the head with the compelling, tightly written original Matrix but the flat second installment and disastrous third show that they have a long way to go. The brothers are basically idea men with admittedly very interesting ideas but no idea how to shape them into plot. For example, at the beginning of the original the idea was set up that Neo would use his new-found powers to free others trapped in the Matrix and use them in the revolution against the machines. This potentially interesting conflict was very nearly completely dropped in the next two installments save for a quick comment by the Architect that those who wanted to leave would be freed. This brings up a major complaint with this film: very little of the plot is resolved by our nominal hero, Neo, which is a primary violation of dramatic writing. The protagonist MUST solve the plot through his own devices. The aptly named Deus Ex Machina basically hands Neo a win. Sorry but that's not playing fair with the audience. Revolutions takes what was a thought-provoking idea and turns it into a couple of mediocre fight scenes, a bunch of watered-down Eastern philosophy, and an ending that neither makes sense nor resolves the plot in a satisfying manner. Pass."

","I enjoyed the action sequences in this film however there were to many holes in the plot. It would have been clearer had the screenwriters provided some flashbacks from the last film for those of us that forgot what happened in Matrix 2. I believed that Niobe and her ship were destroyed in Matrix 2. What ever happened to the twin vampire/ghosts from Matrix 2? Why didn't Merovingian help Neo and the others if he knew that the clone/virus Agent Smith was going to take over the Matrix? Did Merovingian want to be absorbed by the clone/virus Agent Smith? Why couldn't they explain why the Oracle changed her appearance? Why would the Architect/Deus Ex Machina need  Neo, a human to stop the clone/virus Agent Smith? Neo rose from the dead in the Matrix and brought Trinity from the dead in Matrix 2. What's preventing Neo from returning again from the dead with Trinity? The screenwriters set up an unbelievable premise that was to difficult to follow with too much philosophical mish mash when Neo talked to the Architect in Matrix 2. They seem to have abandoned that slipshod premise from Matrix2 when they wrote Matrix 3. All in all the film was compelling but only up to a point. They needed to keep the story plot clear. I read in some tabloid that one of the Wachowski brothers was undergoing a sex change operation. In the DVD special features section I was fully expecting to see one of the Wachowski brothers as a female by now. Did he change his mind?"

","The Matrix Revolutions is, in many ways, a photographic negative of its younger sibling, The Matrix Reloaded. Where Reloaded was sloth and bogged down with exposition, Revolutions is tightly directed and ever conscious of advancing the plot. Where Reloaded runneth over with hyperbolic effects sequences, Revolutions integrates its effects seamlessly and, in the case of the attack on Zion, even beautifully and elegantly. Where Reloaded's fight choreography was cluncky, Revolutions recaptures much of the grace of the first film's fight scenes. Where Reloaded's ""philiosophy,"" if it could be called that, was intellectual masturbation akin to an excited freshman taking Phil 101, Revolutions is a clever fable focusing on depth in one tradition, namely High Christology, rather than breadth among many, often contradictory schools. Finally, where Reloaded's characters are emotionless and incidental to the storyline (the most important people in the story are, well, not people at all it turns out), the very humanity of Revolutions characters is pivotal to the plot.<br/><br/>So, before I go any further, the Wachowskis deserve a tip of the hat. Revolutions is such a stark improvement over Reloaded that there can be no other explanation but that the directors, for once, listened. They listened to the complaints, gripes, and insults, and actually departed from their grand, pretentious vision, went back to the editing room (less than six months before release, remember), and set out to make an exciting conclusion to the defining science fiction work of the decade.<br/><br/>Yet, despite the valiant effort to overcome the parameters of Reloaded, the filmmakers cannot quite launch Revolutions out of its predecessor's orbit. Revolutions is trapped having to explain or conveniently overlook the myriad of undeveloped ideas, vague concepts, philosophical rambles, and just plain bad storytelling that plagued Reloaded.<br/><br/>For example, Reloaded independently introduced the concepts of ""choice"" and ""purpose,"" but never got around to resolving the two. Revolutions picks up the conflict, yet also scratches its head in confusion. So in the end, just what kind of argument Revolutions is trying to make about rhyming choice with destiny is a bigger question than Neo's ultimate fate (a question I think you can answer by taking the film's Christian imagery to its philosophical conclusion). <br/><br/>Halfway through, when the Merovingian prepares to deliver another bombastic rant, Trinity mumbles, ""I don't have time for this,"" and draws a gun to his head. If only she had pulled the trigger."

","May I point out that ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" are the only somewhat original stories out of the trilogy. In case you haven't noticed, Will Smith has a new movie coming out called ""I,Robot"" based on a novel written by Isaac Asimov in 1966 where the plot revolves around machines turning against humans...hmm...that sounds familiar, now combine that with a little bit of ""Tron"" and ""Terminator 2"" and you've got yourself the ""Matrix"". Since the Wachowski brothers had so much to steal from for the first movie, it turned out very good. I like it...a lot. However, the proved their true writing skills with the crap they recently released, paying no attention to details. I begin with one burning question, the agents. It is speculated that the agents work for the architect. So tell me why the agents employed by the architect would be trying to kill Neo, when it is the architect who needs Neo to deliver him the code he needs to restart the Matrix? He could plant the code in anyone he wants, why Neo? Why would the agents also be trying to kill the keymaker, when he needs to deliver Neo to the architect? The Wachowski brothers claim that they wrote all three movies at once, so tell me why they insisted on waiting until the 2nd movie to unveil many key characters such as the Merovingian, the keymaker, the architect. Where the heck were they before? They were never even mentioned. I want to know why the architect continuously lets Zion be rebuilt and then plants a code within a human and waits, and waits, and waits for the ""One"" to bring it to him so he can destroy Zion all over again. Is he that bored? Or does he have a God complex? Not to mention, the incredible amount of technology the city of Zion achieves in such a short period of time. You think with all the advanced technology they have (Electromagnetic Pulse, spaceships, robots) that they could find a way to beat these sentinels? (name stolen from X-Men)And what kind of a program (Merovingian) is programmed to have sinful lust urges and cheat on his programmed wife (Bellucci). So advanced the architect is to create such realistic programs yet he cannot defeat a single human. I do enjoy the fact that he created the Oracle, a program who seems to have more working knowledge of the Matrix he created then he does. I'm disappointed that they hardly ever use ""Bullet time"". The coolest FX created lately. They didn't even use their own trademark. Supposedly, Neo can manipulate the Matrix, remember that from the first Matrix? All Neo does is fly and stop bullets. Oh, and Neo isn't the One, technically, he's the sixth, so calling him the one...is a little...retarded. Spend your time wisely watching something without so many unanswered questions."

How did Agent Smith get that bit of source code written in? Nebulous philosophy didn't accomplish it, which is what everyone in this movie is so adept at.<br/><br/>Notice how, in the glorious climax, when Neo plants his fist into Agent Smith to convert him, that the Wachowskis immediately cut to extreme long shot over the city for a short light show of all the Agent Smiths turning into Neo. This is necessary to complete Neo's status as a Christ figure; referencing the conversion of the pagan Roman emperor Constantine to Christianity and subsequent dissemination of that religion to the world.<br/><br/>
However, the Wachowskis realized that mass conformity is unsightly no matter who the leader figure is, and skip the spectacle of showing a million Agent Neos looking on from the sidelines.<br/><br/>5/10"

","If the first Matrix movie was something entirely original, and the second was all about philosophy, this one was purely an action movie. Plot-wise, I felt like several of the questions posed in Reloaded went unanswered, and that generally it wasn't a satisfying end to the series. I wanted to hear more about what happened to Zion, more about The One, more about the Architect, and so on. This film focused primarily on the machine world, which was so neglected in Reloaded that it felt confusing and surprising in this one on a good day, and contrived on a bad. However, the action sequences were well-done, it was reasonably suspenseful, and if it had been released as a stand-alone action movie, would have been pretty good."

In Revolutions I found that the editing(writing/directing) kept the viewer away from the ""hero"" characters for too long-- I think the intensity could probably have been amplified with reasonable cutting back and forth between the battle in the Dock at Zion and whatever was supposedly going on with Neo and Trinity....  over-all, I think the second and third installments just seemed to repeat the same kind of action sequences without introducing any new reason to really care what was happening to these people....

","Okay, so Matrix Reloaded couldn't compare to the original.  Few sequels can, so this is somewhat expected.  But Reloaded did have those phaser-guys and the 3 million dollar highway chase which appeared to pay off rather well. Neo is further developed into Superman, etc.  My point in all of this Reloaded regurgitation is to tell you that Matrix Revolutions, in terms of new introductions since the original Matrix, had a big nada.  And it almost breaks my heart to say it since I absolutely loved the genius of the original.  Not just the special effects in it but the story as well.  What is even more sad is that the third installment doesn't even utilize the talents of the cast well since most of the time you are being overrun with special effects.  Typically in storytelling the introduction and the conclusion are one of the most important elements that ""house"" the body. They respectively pique curiosity and give lasting impressions.  While The Matrix definitely got everyones' attention, Revolutions ran out of gas on leaving an positive lasting remembrance.  The trilogy sort of reminds me of an exam I took once.  On the first portion I took quite a bit of time, re-read my answers, and double-checked my work.  As a result my scores were great.  The second half I was a little cursory, but still managed to go back and review.  My scores were satisfactory but not as exceptional as before. On the last part of the test I realized I was severely running out of time and hastily ended up ""Christmas treeing"" a portion of it.  No surprise that the results were poor.  Matrix Revolutions was the same  Christmas-tree ending.  Maybe they didn't budget money well as I should have budgeted time well on my exam."

Guess I was wrong on part of the religious allegory, but I thought the POINT of ""Reloaded"" was that Neo had his powers in BOTH realities.  He was the Messiah, the ""promised one"" of Judaism, Christianity AND Islam (probably others as well). He was battling the ""antiChrist,"" Smith, who had broken through the Matrix and could steal souls. Instead, we're left with ""the Oracle"" (God?) and ""the architect"" (Satan?) on EQUAL levels and ""Love,"" (personified as a beautiful child) awaiting the eventual return of Neo. It all seemed pretty pointless; as, alas, does life, sometimes.<br/><br/>I HAD hoped Neo would confront the architect, disable the matrix and awaken those who were ""sleeping."" THAT would have eliminated Smith and disabled the machines. Instead, Neo makes a bargain with the ""collective conscious"" of the machines in order to defeat Smith, who threatened to destroy them all. NONSENSE! Smith NEVER showed contempt for the machines.  Besides, Smith was intelligent software that had developed a foolproof method to keep the ""awake"" from penetrating the matrix. If they did, Smith could capture their souls. The machines should have LOVED permanently perpetuating the matrix, even if they ""feared"" Smith was becoming TOO powerful.<br/><br/>The final confrontation with Smith reminded me of the climax to ""Scanners."" In this connotation, that seems a bit silly.<br/><br/>IF Neo WAS the messiah, what was the need for the LOVE software?<br/><br/>We are left with an ending in which there was no longer a need for a matrix at all, since ""the architect"" promised to release the ""sleepers.

","So many people had told me that MATRIX REVOLUTIONS was a disappointment, that I refused to believe them. Its short theatrical run here in Mexico prevented me from viewing it in all its splendor, but fortunately at last, I rented it on DVD and watched it with my home theater full blast. I loved the first MATRIX and most of you will agree it's a cinematic achievement. MATRIX RELOADED somehow annoyed some people, but it was an action-packed, worthy successor that I personally enjoyed even more than the first. I'm sorry to say that MATRIX REVOLUTIONS is INDEED disappointing due to its oblique and vague ending. I won't mention any spoilers but this I will say: the MATRIX franchise is NOT over. The way the film ends, it gives the WACHOWSKI BROS. a chance to further the series sometime in the future. It seems that all the philosophical mumbo-jumbo of the first two grew way too big and made it literally impossible for ""Revolutions"" to have a satisfactory ending. This said, however, MATRIX REVOLUTIONS still holds as a fine Sci-Fi, action-packed movie, and it moves along at a nice and unboring pace. The character of the Oracle comes more into the way of things,but by the same token, other characters, like Morpheus, become almost extras! Niobe and captain Mifune become more important elements in this installment, but the Merovingio and Persephone are shamelessly wasted with 3 second parts. MATRIX REVOLUTIONS may demand some repeated viewing (if you're a real fan) to fully grasp its intentions, but this review is based on my SECOND viewing (indeed, I enjoyed the second viewing more than the first!). MATRIX REVOLUTIONS is NOT a BAD film by any means, but in regards to its previous installments, it is by far the weakest one."

","The critics unfairly targeted and blasted this final chapter in the 'Matrix' trilogy. Although, I am not saying they were completely wrong in doing so. The problem involving the 'Matrix' sequels is one of expectation. After the brilliant first chapter that provided us with an amazing story and with tremendous action and special effects, our expectations were really high for the second chapter. 'Reloaded' still carried the same amazing special effects and knockout action but it lacked the heart of the first film. The plot became more of a puzzle in 'Reloaded', and consequently fell below our expectations. 'Revolutions' was expected to be the grand finale, a rewarding ending that would more than make up for the disappointment endured in 'Reloaded'. But, the ending is where 'Revolutions' stumbles. The ending does not really resolve anything and many audiences were left feeling empty. And as a result, 'Revolutions' received all of this criticism.<br/><br/>My stand on 'Revolutions' is that it is a decent sci-fi action movie but it is not a good ending to the 'Matrix' trilogy. As I mentioned the earlier, the ending is quite an empty gesture. But the rest of the film is pretty decent, in terms of action and visual effects, but like 'Reloaded' is nowhere near as good as the first movie.

","Let's look first at this whole trilogy. Matrix was great, by far one of the coolest films of our time. Visually stunning, story well thought out, even the acting was good. You have to admit Keanu Reeves nailed this part. Then came two. And then three. I have already discussed two, so I'll just skip over to this monstrosity.<br/><br/>Spoiler warning-<br/><br/>Neo wakes from his cliffhanger dream inside the Matrix, without attachments. So, they trapped his consciousness? Dear God. So then, he needs to think about what he must do. Only to come to the simple conclusion he must confront the head honcho. Wow, took him a long time to figure that out. So, those pesky humans race back to Zion, a trip that usually takes a few hours, takes them near eternity? Please. So Neo gets half way to his destiny, only to confront a Smith, and eve when he says Mr. Anderson, Neo is still confused. Holy crap. Then comes the climactic conclusion, which I will not spoil here.<br/><br/>There are so many bad things to say about this movie, I hardly know where to begin. First off, the characters. I found that I stopped caring what happened to them about twenty minutes into it. With exception to one, I will come to that momentarily. I didn't give a flying crap what happened with Morpheus. In fact, half way through I was rooting for the machines to just end it.<br/><br/>Which brings me to a major complaint I have. The war scene, way too long. It was like they were trying to duplicate LOTR: TTT battle scene. I was actually falling asleep, and again hoping the machines would just hurry up and win. It was inevitable anyway. Humans had nothing. Why didn't they use the electroguns on the killer robots? Then, just in the nick of time comes Morpheus and the gang. But, do they really help the situation? No. Just delay longer.<br/><br/>The only pay off this film has to offer is a character to which I absolutely loved. And that was Agent Smith. He is the reason I give this such a high rating. For those few moments, any moments with Smith, I was energized. His dialogue, the articulation, the anger towards the end. The asking of why. I loved it. Both Hugo Weaving and Ian Bliss did an amazing job. Hugo, at least, should win a best villains award. I was literally creeped out when his army came after the Oracle.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this was a complete waste of time. If you liked Smith in the first, see this for just that. Skip all the other crap, because that's what it was. I left the theater feeling like I had wasted money, wasted money on the Matrix. When the first came out, I saw it several times just to try and understand it. Then, it becometh a ruin. One thing it was though, was better than Reloaded.<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

I kept asking myself questions like, ""Why did they make this movie so bad?'.<br/><br/>I like cgi, eye candy and goo goo graphics. But, I also like to see some real good fight scenes or a car chase that blows your mind (Reloaded). If I wanted to watch robot wars, I would have turned on cartoon network and watched Transformers (I'm not cutting down Transformers, it's much better then this movie). This movie was pretty much Battle Bots on Steroids.<br/><br/>
I'm not a kung fu nut or a martial arts buff. When I plug myself into the Matrix though, that's what I want. I want awesome fight scenes like in the previous Matrix movies or a mind blowing car chase.

","WARNING **SPOILERS**<br/><br/>I don't like to be led too much by previews and reviews before I see a film, although I happily read them.  So I was quite distressed to read so many negative pieces in the press about The Matrix Revolutions.  Naturally, I ignored them, and went to the cinema to see it.  Frankly, I felt let down by part three.  Addmitedly, Reloaded was a loud, brash rollercoaster, but it was bloody good fun at least.  So even though the good guys win in the end of Revolutions, it was alarming how much it felt like a downer.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, when the DVD came out, I snapped it up (gotta complete the set, y'see!!), and having seen it a couple more times, I now look at it in a different light.<br/><br/>It's good.  Not great, but good.  Some people have said that it is a shame that Neo, Trinity and Morpheous are not part of the battle for Zion, but why should they be?  They weren't in Zion at the end of Reloaded, and as Revolutions is a direct continuation of that film, there is no real reason for them to be there.  Certainly Neo (Keanu Reeves) has bigger fish to fry, for one thing.<br/><br/>Oh course, if you haven't seen the first two films in the series, this will leave you completely lost.  In fact, first time round, I was still completely lost by the end.  What happened exactly?  Has Neo been turned into a machine, or is he alone powering the machines so that the rest of the enslaved human race can go free?  Is the Oracle dead? (should that be off-line?)  Why did they kill off Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss)?  She died once already didn't she?  It seems a bit much she has to die twice in the space of twenty-four hours (in film time)!!!<br/><br/>Still, if you sit back and think about everything that happens while it's happening, it does start to make sense in a pseudo-religious, larger-world kind of way.  All the Biblical references are there, but I won't go into them here, as so many other people have beaten me to it, suffice to say that in one sense, the Deux Ex Machina sacrifices its son - Neo, in order to save the world, and defeat the renegade Smith(s).  Revolutions is more in tune with the first film than the second and is a fitting, if disconcerting, end to the saga.

These are both very well crafted, and solved nicely.<br/><br/>There has been some negative comment about the lack of ""bullet time"" use and that the action wasn't crafted as well as it should have been. Considering the battle for Zion is in the ""Real World,"" bullet time should not and is not used.  It is a trick that can happen only in the Matrix, as in the battle between Neo and Smith.  Those who aren't spoiled by Hollywood's over use of bullet time (see MI:2, for one) will be pleased with the battle in Zion.  The scene is very intense, even if predictable.<br/><br/>The final fight between Smith and Neo was mind-blowing.  The use of bullet time was wonderful, and every powerful clash or punch thrown was wonderfully accentuated by the energy waves affecting the rain, which was a nice touch.<br/><br/>**POSSIBLE SPOILER -- IF YOU WHINE ABOUT KNOWING TOO MUCH ABOUT MOVIES, DON'T READ ON**<br/><br/>The Wachowskis made a little mistake in action:  In the scene in which Trinity, Morpheus, and Seraph go to see the Merovingian and wind up in a shoot-out, it felt like they dusted off the classic lobby gunfight from the first movie, and just re-wrote the scene.  It worked, and the addition of the villains running across the ceiling was nifty, but it would have been nice to see something a little different (but, how do you do different these days?).  In the scene's defense, there was fantastic acrobatic work.<br/><br/>**END SPOILER**<br/><br/>The acting from most of the cast was better than the average sci-fi/action flick.  Laurence Fishburne was intense as always.  Hugo Weaving portrayed Smith beautifully, especially as his confidence leaves him towards the end of the battle with Neo.  Carrie-Ann Moss gave a stellar performance, especially in her final scene.  The only severe acting problem was Keanu Reeves, who, apart from the ""Bill and Ted"" movies, has never found a role he could play well.  He was bland, though part of that may be on the writing.<br/><br/>**SPOILER**<br/><br/>Reeves did a decent and appropriate job during Trinity's death scene.  It was believable and honest, even if it's an overused piece of scriptwriting.<br/><br/>**END SPOILER**<br/><br/>All in all, this movie, though not pleasing in all the stereotypical, Hollywood happy endings kind of way, was written the way that it had to be to end the series.  There were some unanswered questions, but thus is ""The Matrix"" -- if all the questions were answered, then it would just be another meaningless piece of sci-fi/action film.  The mystery is what made the entire series (i.e. ""What is the Matrix?"" promos and ads).

I loved the way that the plot focuses on the love thread that goes through the other 2 movies and finally shows the purpose of the plot thread. I did not like the second matrix because of the gratuitous combat scenes that seemed to go on forever. I think that in evaluating this movie you need to keep in mind that it is both a cyber thriller, a political commentary and a comic book style of film, and I think it succeeds in all of these. A great movie, a bit over the top in the action sequences but overall a great film."
"ChunkBC","Null","0","0","9 April 2004"," Hmm...never quite lived up to the promise....
","Well, the third is out, and I have to say, it never really lived up to the promise of the first movie. A surprise? To many I don't think so. The original movie was a triumph for the fact that it came out of no where, a complete success because of it's lack of publicism.<br/><br/>By the second and third, it feels like the great conceptual world created by the brothers has become in some way tainted by their desire to pack in the blockbusting, buttock chafing special effects. I heard Joel Schumaecer getting rather excited about the movie 'changing the way films will be made for years to come.' I really hope someone in Hollywood didn't see this as the Gospel truth: extract story, Check...Add over the top stunts touted as the best thing ever seen! (over protracted, especially with the CGI Neo vs. 50+ Smith's in the third!)<br/><br/>What the third succeeds in is proving to me that big money can be the ruin of any great idea. The acting seems stilted, Keanu tries too hard to be serious (what a lack of human emotion, is he human....) and the story never gets any where. What you do get is more and more heroic/metaphysical mumbo jumbo, that makes less sense than a chocolate tea-pot. I don't even for one minute believe the actors even know what happened.<br/><br/>See this for a conclusion, but don't expect anything life changing or satisfying. I came out of the cinema, and as I walked down the steps to the exit, throughout the whole of the cinema came the loudest, possibly record breaking sigh i have ever heard. Not from being touched by the film; from a mass of cinema goers realising they had jusy parted with a sum total of Â£10 upwards, and would never again get back the 4 hours or so spent on watching this."

","First off if you thought Keanu Reeves is a great actor, well think again! This movie really shines the light on that fact!  Take for instance the scene where his so called love of his life, Trinity was impalled three times and dying.  His voice stays the same monotone through out, what should have been a passionate and intense scene turned out to me somewhat of a comedy. Considering too that he can not see?!  Was this something that was intended to help the scene out?  It was a joke!  Even Trinity herself seemed annoyed by him?  Latent homosexual feelings or something.<br/><br/>Point two:  Where was all the great music?  It was like a boring theatrical without music.  It left me feeling that the budget was extremely low, considering the previous Matrix movies?!  Did the studios give more money to other projects they considered may bring in more box office green?<br/><br/>I am going to see it again on video rental, this time for a good laugh.  I was very disappointed, however the ending was very colorful and had some meaning.  Again it lacked alot of what it could have been.  I hope in time Keanu Reeves spends some of his money on acting lessons and realizes that he won't always have his good looks to get him action film parts.<br/><br/>Too bad for Matrix fans and Morpheus the strong hold character in all this also lacked his drive and enthusiasm.  It appeared that the cast it self was not at all into this third episode. If a Matrix fan I recommend you see it and give your own review here. Otherwise save your hard earned green!"

Neo can't beat Smith, so he gives in, but he dies to save Zion, just like Jesus died to save all of mankind. That ringing a bell? But, I guess non-christians wouldn't appreciate that as much as christians do. However, the thing that I did not like about that movie was Trinity's ten-minute long death scene.

","Time to fall somewhere between all the other comments, it seems that everyone is looking for something specific, but me being interested, but not enamored with SFX, religious connections, or some great deeper meaning, I thought I could provide some ""regular filmgoer"" thoughts.<br/><br/>First, it is a good movie, but not something to watch unless you have seem Reloaded. Since it opens with no recap, someone that missed the second film would be completely lost.  I did prefer Reloaded because I like the new charactors introduced, the Frenchman, Seraph, the Architect, and the Keymaker.  All of them were solid and made me interested in what may be happening next.  I developed an attachment to each, even if they were bad guys.  Revolutions give us some new, but uninteresting people, I didn't care about most of the people in Zion so why should I care if they win? The Wachowski's seem to write better Matrix type people then real people.<br/><br/>Next, though the SFX were very cool, the move was so dark it was hard to visually take them all in.  The fight scene for control of Zion was nice, though a tad too long in my opinion.  I thought this war would be won in the Matrix, but after about the first half of the film we were never returned to the place the entire series began...what is with that? It's the Matrix, without the matrix.  <br/><br/>Neo's final fight with Smith seemed pointless, Neo could not win, but I guess that was the point.  To destroy Smith, Neo had to be assimilated (the Borg would be so proud) so the machines could gain control of the program Smith. By the way, is Neo dead? in another coma? or just a program?  Someone help me on this?<br/><br/>Finally, We found out in the second movie that Neo was just the most recent ""One,""  each time a matrix is created another ""One"" comes with it. Therefore won't this whole thing just keep happening over and over? Yes, billions will now be freed, but where will they go? Zion appeared a tad overcrowded already and the machines, though at peace for the moment, don't seem ready to give some of their beautifully landscaped territory to the humans that have already tried to destroy them once.  <br/><br/>So, it is a good film, but I prefer the other two based on the matrix action.  Will enjoy the day I buy them all and sit and watch them back to back to back...maybe more of this will make sense!"

","The Matrix Revolutions was the best in the trilogy I think. There was a sense of urgency which the other two movies lacked. You could see Agent Smith's clones multiplying fast, but there were still some problems and the movie did drag a bit. It was sort of scary but also indulging. However, though I do love the fighting sequences, i thought all the movies made them go on too long in which one loses the attention span. For instance, the last fight between Neo and Agent Smith really dragged. It was initially interested but then I decided I would take a break from it. I thought when Trinity died, the only person who acted well was Keanu Reeves. Carrie- Anne Moss just seemed to be delivering some dialogues without real emotion. I liked the parts with the Oracle and 'Everything that has a beginning has an end'. I am no Matrix Trilogy fan...a LOTR one...YES! However, I did feel sorry that 'Revolutions' wasn't given even one Oscar Nomination (for special effects at least)."
"tswindude1221","Null","0","0","8 April 2004"," Not perfect, but quite close (Spoilers)
","Now, first off, I would like to say that I enjoyed this movie to the fullest. I would recommend it to any Matrix fan (which is just about all of you), a movie goer that loves to see incredible art in the movies they watch, but not the casual movie-goer who hasn't seen one or two. For one, you'll be lost, and two, you'll end up with a migraine at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Do not read the next 9 paragraphs if you haven't seen the movie.<br/><br/>Now, for my thoughts. My first thought is that this is probably one of the greatest trilogies of our time. The only one that compares to it and happens to beat it is LOTR, but we all expected that, didn't we?<br/><br/>The next one is that this movie is more conclusive than most people let themselves believe it is. Now, to understand the ending, there were two important clues that we learned over the trilogy, but were developed over time. They were when Neo got bugged and when Smith was destroyed by Neo. Both of these things happened in the first movie, yes, but we don't fully understand them until the third one.<br/><br/>In The Matrix Reloaded, Smith talks to Neo about part of Smith being over-writed onto Neo, and vice-versa. Then he talks about how he's freed from the Source. He doesn't say ""The Source"", but he references it by talking about how he was supposed to go and be deleted, but decided to stay in exile. Now, if Smith wasn't destroyed by Neo, he would still have had a connection to the Source and would've had to obey it. If there were any problems with Smith, the Source could've just deleted Smith when it wanted to. However, Smith wasn't connected to the Source anymore.<br/><br/>However, Neo was. When Smith lost his connection to the Source, Neo gained his. That's why Neo was able to destroy the machines just by thinking it.<br/><br/>The whole thing about Neo being bugged just shows that The Matrix cannot track every single one of its inhabitants. They have absolutely no connection to the Source unless bugged. The Matrix can follow its inhabitants moves through computer programs, but, otherwise, it has absolutely no control over its inhabitants.<br/><br/>That's why when Smith took over the people of The Matrix, nothing happened to him. However, when Smith took over Neo, Neo had the most direct connection with the Source. Neo realized this, and figured that only the Source could stop Smith. So, when Smith took over Neo, Smith was reconnected with the Source. So, all the Source did was delete Neo/Smith, and that caused a cataclysmic destruction of Smith. All of the Smiths were intertwined with each other, so, when one is deleted, so are the others.<br/><br/>There are many more clues that prove my point, but the two I said were the most basic.<br/><br/>The one other thing I would like to say is that I saw a lot of things that were similar to The Passion of the Christ. For one, when Jesus is being scourged, He gets back up to show that no matter how hard they try they can't win. In The Matrix Revolutions, Smith has dropped Neo about a hundred feet into the street. Smith watches as Neo tries to get up, but Neo can't. Smith then asks why Neo keeps on fighting. Neo gets up, showing absolutely no pain, and says, ""Because I choose to."" Another thing that's similar is when Jesus is crucified and has died, the enemies of Jesus think that he has lost when really he won. When Smith took over Neo, Smith thought he had won. In reality, Smith had lost.<br/><br/>My only problem with this whole movie is that Neo didn't get to kill Smith. Of course, what we got was a much better ending, true, but I'm just one of those people who would've loved to see Smith being beat up by Neo. Of course, Trinity was probably the reason Neo didn't kill Smith.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, this is one movie I recommend completely for viewing many times over. You can't really understand The Matrix unless you watch all three movies many times. I still don't truly understand it, and I'm still trying to figure it out. Until then, I'll just keep watching the movies and patiently wait for The Matrix Online to come out.  <br/><br/>My review: 9/10"

","The Matrix is not a trilogy, its just the first movie.  The other 2 ruin it. Part three is the nail in the coffin.  It is watchable, but in my opinion a far cry from the genius that was shown in the first installment.  The next 2 chapters have too many religious references using Neo as ""the savior"".  What should have been done is this:<br/><br/>Matrix Revolutions should have had it turn out that there was a Matrix within a Matrix and in reality, it was humans enslaving other humans to use them as energy by tricking them into thinking they were at war with the machines, when really, there were no machines.  That would have been a much more mind blowing ending and making quite a statement about human nature at the same time, and people would have watched the movie and left in aw.

","What a dire film!  As a massive fan of the first Matrix film, and a semi-supporter of the second, I can't believe how badly the plot was lost in this one.<br/><br/>The main reasons for considering the original film to be a classic were the visual style and impact, and the great martial arts set pieces.  This film is largely set in a hole in the ground (score nil points for visual impact), and the fight scenes are no longer interesting, as they forgo martial arts for superman II style flying antics(except Sups II was a much much better film).<br/><br/>And the end??

","*** WARNING:  Some spoilers within ***<br/><br/>Somehow, I saw the ending to Revolutions coming.  Many will notice the film styling of all three Matrix movies match techniques used by several prominent artists and animators in Japan.  It was this sleek style and method of storytelling that made the Matrix unique.  The Brothers created the impossible:  a true live-action anime.<br/><br/>However, anime reflects many trends.  One such long standing trend in anime/videogames is to convolute the ending, as seen in such anime like Evangilion and games like Final Fantasy 9.  Of course, the Matrix Revolutions picks up on the convolution as well.  The Brothers left a lot of unexplained plot threads out in the open at the end of this movie.  Yes, a few were explained by the Animatrix and Enter the Matrix.  But to require an audience as large as the one the original movie enraptured to go out, buy them, and then stomach them, is just amateurish on the part of the Brothers.<br/><br/>Regarding the heavy-handed religious symbolism, I didn't mind it.  In fact, I think it's one of the charms of the trilogy.   The main problem with the symbolism in the third movie is that it takes a full 180 degree turn from being faintly hinted at in the first movie to being the central story. The Brothers could have sacrificed some of the ""Pilgrimage"" to re-explain some of the plot points dropped in the Animatrix and Enter the Matrix for the benefit of those who didn't go out and buy them.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>The greatest crime, however, was leaving the Merovingian out in loose-string-land.  Almost all of the characters lost their intrigue in Reloaded, while the Merovingian was the only one who retained his intrigue even after the end of Reloaded.  The Brothers went to a lot of work to make him seem like a central figure to the story, and then they just dropped him in the first quarter of Revolutions.  Unforgivable.  One of the themes running through all three Matrix movies was rebelling against conformity and authority, and when the Merovingian made his appearance, you knew he embodied both conformity and authority, and even more, he wielded it like a sword against his enemies.  I believe he represented this theme even more so than Smith, who ended up loosing all of his marbles and going completely insane by the time of the final confrontation.  A final confrontation with the Merovingian would have been much more appropriate to end this Trilogy.<br/><br/>*** END SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>In the end, the final chapter of the Matrix comes as no surprise to me.<br/><br/>I went into the theater with low expectations and came out with no change in my opinion.  The tragedy here is that this Trilogy could have been something great.   By taking away the Animation, and thus the stigma of ""kiddy cartoons"", it could have given the masses a glimpse of what good anime really is. To its credit, the movies did achieve that goal--it let the masses see what bad anime is."

","I felt that, although Revolutions wasn't as good as the first two, This movie was a beautiful piece of art, that gave me mixed emotions, and made me; cry, laugh, wince, scream, and space out into another world. This movie had Romance, Action, and so much more. the Wachowski brothers have truly done something that will be talked about for years. Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Hugo weaving, are amazing actors, and actresses, and they have performed unbelieveibly in this trilogy. I love the connection that Neo and Trinity have. They truly love each other with all their hearts. The only thing I think that they could have done differently with the trilogy, is I thought that since there were so many fight scenes, and such in Reloaded, that they sort of had to cram it all in Revolution. other than that, I think these movies are the best in the intire world, and I will treasure them forever."

There's a whole lot of nothing being said (on screen) but the message is clear: All you need is love. <br/><br/>Revolutions is all about Peace. An end to the war, which unfortunately plays like a techno geek war picture. People cheering, characters dying in long drawn out heroic style, and guns guns guns... with no dramatic punch. The only really interesting part of the story is Neo's. And I'd imagine he's on the screen less than half the movie.<br/><br/>
The attack and the fight for freedom etc. is all very awe inspiring the first few times you see the squids attacking, but boy the whole thing gets monotonous. And heavy handed.

But I have to think there's better ways to do so.<br/><br/>

","Great trilogies end with a scream, not a whisper.  They end on a note which is satisfying, tying up every loose end.  It was unfortunate that the Matrix Revolutions was released in such close proximity to The Return of the King, with each film either a textbook lesson in how to complete, or how NOT to complete a trilogy.  I'll leave it to you to guess which film is which. The parallels between The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings are difficult to ignore.  Each trilogy features films that were made concurrently (the final two in Matrix, all three in LOTR) and each aims to immerse the viewer in an alternate world.  The success of LOTR only draws more attention to the fact that Revolutions is a big dull dud. The biggest problem with Revolutions is that the Wachowskis haven't bothered to answer any of the questions thrown up in the first two films.  At the end of the film I was left scratching my head and thinking, 'Huh?'  If the answers were lying in the mystic mumbo jumbo spouted by every bloody character in lieu of decent dialogue, I must have missed it. The special effects are indeed spectacular, but unfortunately they come at the expense of anything resembling a cohesive story.  The fight scenes are simply rehashes of fight scenes in the first two movies-Trinity and co running up walls, hiding behind the pillars that are so helpfully in every sodding room in the Matrix.  And the less said about Smith and Neo's climactic 'burly brawl' the better.  If Michael Bay (Pearl Harbor, Bad Boys II) has taught us anything, it's that bigger isn't necessarily better. There is a dispiriting sense that, rather than bothering to make a decently plotted action film, the Wachowskis are simply making it up as they go along.  Supporting characters wander in and out aimlessly, included for no apparent reason. Monica Belluci's Persephone is presumably only included to up the film's T&A quotient- her breasts are as much in defiance of gravity as Trinity and Co in the preceding fight scene. And as for the climactic battle of Zion, the Wachowski's have done the unthinkable- not one major character from the original film is there. Instead what we have is a collection of cliches- the earnest kid who'll save the day, the wife who's been left behind, the general who attempts to rally his troops  with a series of inane speeches (Laurence Olivier's Henry V he ain't). So, without a character to root for, what we are watching in essentially a giant CGI video game, albeit a very impressive one. Most insultingly, the film doesn't as much conclude as simply stop.  One can only surmise that the Wachowskis got backed into a corner, slapped on an ending and thought 'Yeah, that'll do'. And I could go on- Trinity, such a strong character in the first film, has been reduced to simply gazing doe eyed at Neo and following him into certain death.  It wouldn't be so bad if there wasn't a complete absence of chemistry between the two actors. Maybe I'm missing the point. It's consistently rammed home throughout the film that the difference between humans and machines is that humans have choice.  Well, I unfortunately chose to see this movie.  And I choose to think it sucked.  If Peter Jackson was ever strapped for cash and forced to give film maker's summer school, the Wachowskis should be legally obliged to attend."

","The Matrix: Nice action movie, but not original as most people wanted us to believe. Rip everything from ancient mythology, commercial film making (the bullet time), anime and add a bit of publicity. Voila, the sleeper hit of 1999. The sequels were highly anticipated and while backpacking in Australia last year I even bothered and went to the opening at midnight in Brisbane. Reloaded was a big disappointment and I didn't even bother watching Revolutions in cinema. But I saw it on DVD last night and rented it.<br/><br/>Whoever hailed the Wachowskis as talents should be laughed and mocked at for the rest of their mortal lives. Looking back it might be very well that Bound (an excellent thriller) is their best. They can do something decent, but with the Matrix Trilogy they have overplayed their hands. Instead of directing the franchise to a really cool direction they keep doing every single thing wrong. What if they killed Neo off in the first one instead of the third one and let the story be taken over by Seraph and Persephone. Now, there are two interesting characters that get way too little screentime. These two facing Smith (Weaving is always good).<br/><br/>Unfortunately we are stuck with Neo (yawn), Morpheus (who lost all credit during his speech before the rave in Reloaded) and that cliche story of The Kid. O, and the rest of that Zion sequence. All characters dragged by their hairs. Anyone who has seen more than one film could've guessed the outcome of that scene. Trinity could've been one of the best characters (as she was in The Matrix), but she gets too little to do but walking after Neo.<br/><br/>2003: The Year Of The Matrix, or what was it? Ha ha ha.

Not that deep philosophical ""why are we here what is the matrix blah blah blah"" crap, more ""why in god's name did we throw away 3 hours of our lives?""  People who like this movie, hell people who like the whole trilogy can extract as much philosophical meaning as they want out of it.  Its all what they choose to see.  They can go on and on about how great the effects are.  They can write sermons about what a moving experience it is to see the Matrix and how it changed their lives and made them give up gambling and drinking and how great the Wachowski Bros are...but it doesnt mean anything.  Why?  CUZ THE MOVIE SUCKED.  The whole ""well you just dont understand the ending and how original it was and how deep it was"" crap doesnt work on me.  The ending sucked.  The movie sucked.

Yes the first installment had some interesting special effects, but not much else other than one f the worst actors of his generation. There was no story. There was nothing. And every subsequent sequel afterwards less and less so. I really feel sorry for the fans of these films.

","After all these years of waiting for the original Matrix sequels, this was a real disappointment.  I thought that the whole point of the first Matrix was to show that Neo was The One and that his destiny was to destroy the matrix and free all of humankind.  Apparently, that was all wrong.(WARNING-SPOILER!) He makes a deal with the evil robots, sacrifices himself, and the humans get to go on living in their crumby underground city.  The machines free the humans who don't want to be used as batteries anymore, and everyone live crappily ever after.  Whoopidy-doo.<br/><br/>It's like the Wachowski brothers just stopped caring.  There were SO many STUPID things that happened in this movie.  First of all, why didn't the people of Zion have a bunch of electro-magnetic-pulses set up IN ZION? Those stupid robo-warrior suits must have used up a lot of Zion's resources and they sure weren't a very effective when it came to defending the city. Also, when did Neo become SO STUPID?  He stands around in his hover-craft, talking and fighting with Bane, who is so obviously possessed by the evil Agent Smith.  Over and over again, Neo says, ""Who. . . are you?""  This goes on for about 30 years and you really start wishing that Agent Smith/Bane would just KILL Neo and put him out of his stupid misery.  Then the movie ends, giving you more questions than it does answers.  My suggestion to you is to simply deny the existence of the two Matrix sequels.  Go through life pretending that they only made the original Matrix.  You'll be happier that way."

I prefer an emotional story over a thinking one. This one kept my mind going the whole time.  I felt that the other two kind've dragged in few scenes. In this one the fight sequences between the humans and the agents were more realistic.  The previous film's fights were far fetched and pretty fake looking.  The special effects of zion and the sentinels were most undoubtedly the best!  After thinking it over, I give the two prequels both 8/10, and I give Revolutions 9/10.  I have high standards when it comes to movies and I found this masterpiece to be incredibly satisfying."

","**SPOILER ALERT**SPOILER ALERT**SPOILER ALERT**<br/><br/>Since The Matrix Revolutions is the finale to the Matrix series, I want to talk about the finale of the movie, so, WATCH OUT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE END OF THE MOVIE.<br/><br/>First a brief synopsis of the backstory:  Matrix--loved it, watch it once a week.  Matrix Reloaded--don't know, I fell asleep halfway through.  Matrix Revolutions--close to the first Matrix, but there's only one Matrix, so why are we trying to compare apples and metaphysicists?<br/><br/>I want to start by saying ""hats off"" to the Wachowski brothers, creators, writers and directors of the Matrix, but in the spirit of full disclosure, I hardly ever wear a hat anyway.  Today, however, I'm wearing two hats--that of a fan and that of a critic.  I think it's testimony to the power of the Matrix concept and execution that those of us who love it most still feel a vital need to pick at it.  Sorry guys, they treated Shakespeare the same way.<br/><br/>As I understand it, the Brothers W had conceptualized and storyboarded the complete trilogy long before they made their first pitch.  They had acquired their artistic vision via lives spent poring over comics, particularly the large-panelled action genre, whose highly-foreshortened visual framing shows in the directors' apt use of eccentric, heroic camera angles.  And when they had finished shooting and editing the last scene of the last movie, the entire trilogy is said to be almost exactly true to their original storyboards.  These guys knew what they wanted to say, and persevered in their vision through the excrutiating task of wrapping three action/FX features in the space of four years.<br/><br/>Therefore I think it's interesting what they seem to be saying in the last movie.  Originally, we're led to believe that the Matrix is a microcosm, a virtual world that most of us who lie huddled dreaming in our network-enabled pods believe is the real and only world.  We're just here to supply electricity.  But when Morpheus hacks into the Matrix and flushes Neo out of his pod, he welcomes him into the real world, a gritty, post-apocalyptic place where people are wiser but not happier.  Life may not be easy here, but at least it's real life and people are in control of their own destinies, as meager as they are.  And they're fighting to regain their former world.<br/><br/>But Morpheus is a chump--he's being used by the Oracle.  In the Matrix Revolutions we see that what humans want for themselves is of no account, that the battle for Zion is an illusion, a vanity, and that Neo and the warriors of Zion are in fact pawns in a political macro-contest of will between rival factions of renegade software.  We were better off hooked up to the electrical grid, when our highest thoughts and aspirations were at least good for a few kilowatts, and nobody starved to death.<br/><br/>I thought it was interesting that at the end the Oracle was addressed as ""Oracle"" that just before death Neo and Trinity glimpse the ""Sun"", and that Agent Smith, the dominant, evil software entity, replicates himself until he's ninety-percent of the software available.(Mr. Bill?)  Surrealists see a world where we are nothing more than puppets dangling on strings; the Wachowskis see a world where we are nothing more than fuelcells that have the power to stand on two legs and be deceived, in this case by the all-powerful Software Creator, who manages our destinies as disinterestedly as we manage our own pet's destinies.<br/><br/>But come on, Senors Wachowski, if the Matrix and the little lives of the people within it is a meaningless illusion created by self-serving renegade software, then what are you trying to say about yourselves, the all-powerful creators of the Matrix movies, a world of rich experince certain to excite and entrap us humans, but ultimately just an attractive illusion.  Are you playing God here, guys, a brutal and disinterested Oracle?  Or more ominously, are you trying to become God's boss, Mr. Bill?"

All the things that you had come to love about the Matrix just was not there in the last one.

","Like Lord of the Rings, I'll sum up the movie in part 3. The first 2 were great with the 2nd one being the best part. The 3rd was disappointing cuz humans lost and Neo dies and it's not your basic Hollywood ending. I can appreciate that, but it still sucked. I'm a techno-pessimist, so I can relate to the movie. I hate all things computer animated and electronic for the most part. Technology can be good, but as usual, humans only know how to use things for evil and wonder why we're biting our arses. There's still some things I don't understand about Smith and Neo's connection, but it has something to do with an equation balancing itself. Yin and yang, matter and anti-matter, Heaven and Hell, etc. These movies were cool for all kinds of reasons. It touched on philosophy, religion, ethics, science, social and political issues, economics, ecology, martial arts, and everything in between and missing. I liked that Zion reflected a name from Judeo texts. I liked that most of the people in Zion were people of color, reflecting that Earth itself started that way. (Yea, read evolutionary anthropology essays people) And Zion represented a new Earth so to speak. It opened up everyday issues that people couldn't talk about in a creative and unqiue way. The fight scenes were dramatic and innovative and visually stunning. Nothing will top this for awhile. I seriously thought they should've won an Oscar for this movie because it was simply inspiring and ingenious to put together. Of course, the Oscar panel sucks and only picks mostly retarded movies to nominate. They shy away from popular movies most of the time. There are exceptions and this should have been one of them. The movie makes you think if this is a world we wanna live in the way we're going. Awesome job and kudos to everyone in the film. I was proud of Keanu, but he still can't shake that Bill and Ted accent. Carrie was great and Laurence is just THE man. Awesome actor. Stil, it's a movie for our generation and it was great."

","WARNING***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>The Matrix was a great movie. Together, however, the trilogy is terrible. The original movie had a great plot combined with a healthy dose of action and special effects. Matrix: Reloaded was crippled by a confusing and weak plot but was saved by awesome action scenes. And unfortunately, Revolutions has both a bad story and bad action. The sad part is that the story could've been good. The Animatrix had set the stage for a decent storyline. But it looks as if the Wachowski brothers ran out of ideas. In the end, they even confused themselves, so they decided just to throw together the cliche finale to any story, a pure good (Neo) vs. pure evil (Smith) one-on-one battle. Even worse, the overcomplexity of the plot combined with the fact that the (largely irrelevant) Zion battle scene takes up most of the movie's time left nearly every person leaving the theater scratching their heads. And this brings me to the most crucial point: the action scenes. What had made the first two movies unique and respectable was the Matrix scenes. They were cool, sleek, intense and yet calm at the same time. In this movie, we only see one or two scenes of that. The battle for Zion between humans and sentinels is made into the major event in the movie. Although equipped with digital special effects, it is boring compared to the matrix. Now, it's just a Terminator ripoff. And one more thing: In the Matrix, Lawrence Fishburne was a highlight character, powerful and enigmatic. This time around, he's just another guy, barely doing anything the entire movie. What the hell?"

","It's easier to comment Matrix Revolutions now, after all the critics and after the beautiful conclusion of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Now, say bad things about it is, like we say here, ""to kick a dead dog"".  It's easier because you can point all the mistakes and misunderstandings in Revolutions. You know, not even a visual effects nomination it got.<br/><br/>
I spent a lot of time trying to understand the whole thing. Not the story itself, but what the hell did the Wachowski brothers tried to say with the sequels. After some months, I gave up. The holes in the script are there, they're not part of the mysterious story. The useful characters, the real ""One"" thing, or the Architect, or the Oracle, all the great icons that the first movie created, were taken away by the rain.<br/><br/>I liked Matrix Reloaded because it left a lot of new plots to be explained in Revolutions. But when you watch the 3rd one, and it disappoints you, the Reloaded loses its meaning too.<br/><br/>I could make a list of things that disappointed me in Revolutions, but everybody already made it. So I just say: I'm not nerd enough to like a hero that's nothing but an antivirus. And what did Morpheus did in this third movie? Co-pilot?

The frenchman was in the movie for all of two minutes, when it seemed in the second movie he would be an important part of the finale. Monica Bellucci's character did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL. The architect was essentially non-existent. Agent Smith was gone for almost 3/4 of the damn film as well. Most of the secondary stories from the last film basically got the ax, probably because they needed more time for the action sequence.  It was just a big excuse to have an hour long CGI fight sequence that was ""really cool"" and ""Spectacular. The oracle was one of the most puzzling and ignored characters in the finale.  The excuse she had for changing her apperance was so underdeveloped that if this was chicken, the entire audience would come down with a bad case of salmonella.

""Oh, I'm sure he's out there somewhere."" More vague answers to a question that was a response to another question asked earlier and so on and so on.

Let's screw it and put in a bunch of crap that blows up because that's what makes money."" This whole movie was one giant vague question that never gets answered. Every point made in the movie had a half-baked explanation that you would think would get resolved, seeing as how this is the supposed ""final chapter"" of the trilogy.

","The Matrix trilogy is a very valuable piece of cinema. I think it should be required viewing in film classes around the world, by would be actors, directors and screenwriters. Every aspiring Hollywood executive out there should also be made to watch the films. In fact, an entire course should be created around it:<br/><br/>Film 101- How to ruin a perfectly innovative and intelligent movie by turning into a plot-hole ridden, cliched, self-refferential, commercialized, disaster of a trilogy. The Matrix Trilogy<br/><br/>As an addendum , the course should also include:<br/><br/>Marketing 101- How to dupe hundreds of fans into buying crap because you lie and tell them that in order to 'understand' all of your Trilogy, fans must purchase video games, animated movies, play online games,  Happy Meals, decoder pins, etc. The  Wachowski Brothers, The Heirs of Disney.<br/><br/>After the first Matrix movie, it seems as if the Wbros'(Wachowski brothers)only remaining creative ideas pertained to marketing. None of that creative energy was spent on the script, to the woe of nearly all casual Matrix fans and the dissapointment of many a fanboy and girl.<br/><br/>What once started out as a hard sci-fi cyberpunk action adventure story with heavy philosophical and eastern religious undertones and influences in 'The Matrix', devolved into a ridiculously sentimental, cliche war movie in 'Revolutions'. Gone were many of the coherent eastern-philosophy undertones and most of the issues of western philosophy. By the time Revolutions starts, the theme had gone from the free-will philosophy of Buddhism( with a sprinkling of christ references) to all out Calvinism in Reloaded, and culminated with The Easter Story by the end of Revolutions.  That's progress?<br/><br/>Now, before I get to the rest of the film, let me give some of the few goodpoints. Keanu Reeves is still hot whenever he is in his 'Matrix' gear- the man can flat out rock tight black pants, a black t-shirt, and shades. The Attack on Zion was great, great CGI. Smith was good. Trinity called the frenchman 'Merv'- that was great.<br/><br/>As for the rest...where to start? Here's a point by point breakdown.<br/><br/>1) The MacGuffin- Maybe the Wbros are Hitchcock fans, because it seems as though half the characters in the film were nothing more than MacGuffins(look it up if you dont know). The 'ghosts' in Reloaded? No significance. The Merovingian( Merv lol) and his wife? No significance. Seraph? ( no real significance, just a bodyguard). The Kid? Just a gopher. The Zion PTA(Council)? Nada. So many conspicuously named characters, so much speculation, and it was all for nought. Nothing more than a giant Maguffin by the Wbros, meant to stimulate the mental masterbation of the fans, in order to..to keep them coming back for more( i..e movies, games, pop tarts, etc). Someone else put it excellently. The reason the Matrix films are popular is the reason why religions are as well- they tell everything and nothing.<br/><br/>2)Communication Breakdown-I was so sick of the dialogue by the end of Reloaded, and Revolution continued with more of the same. Not so much the content of the dialogue( although that was cheesy in some instances, usually in regards to general mifune). I was so tired of everyone having the same conversations. Here's an example:<br/><br/>""I don't know"" ""You will know in time"" ""How will I know?"" ""To know the why is to know the wherefore."" ""Do you know?"" ""I know as much as you know"" "" But I dont know so that means...."" ""I dont either""<br/><br/>Now, other than the non-sensicality of the above passage, the annoying thing is just the didactic structure. Every conversation, every single one, in Reloaded and to an extent in Revolutions is structured this same exact way. Now, giving the Wbros credit, maybe they intended the speech to emulate the sort of deductive logic used in philosophy. But even if that was their intention, it got really annoying, and is unrealistic to boot. Now wonder why all the characters are stale and lifeless- everyone speaks in the same monotonous and soulless way.<br/><br/>
3) Deja Poo- Cliche Cliche Cliche. Now, Im not against film cliches. They are cliche for a reason- they are usually integral elements to certain types of stories. When used succesfully, the cliche can be very effective. But when used inappropriately, cornyness is the result. The best(worst) examples being- Mifune and The Kid aka Officer and a Gentleman. The Neofix- now religious types, dont get me wrong. Im not saying christianity is cliche, just the visuall allusions to it. All of Neo and Trinity's 'romance', especially hear death scene; all 20 minutes of it.<br/><br/>4) To answer your question..what was it? Maybe if they had called the film 'Matrix Resolutions', less people would have been disappointed. Not much was successfully resolved in this film, or at least, not resolved in the way people had hoped. Some answers were glossed over(ergo not really answered) such as- How can Neo have powers in the real world? How come the other humans dont get hurt anymore when they fight in the Matrix?<br/><br/>Other questions are a result of the of the films conclusion- Why should the machines keep the peace? Inst the peace just temporary? Wont the freed humans eventually want to be rid of the machines and vice versa?<br/><br/>
Other questions ..hoo boy, these are the ones that made me want to throw my Sprite at the screen when I was watching. They  are the result of the directors' idiocy such as: What did Neo do that was different from any other One?-the Matrix still got rebooted. What was the whole point of Mobile Ave?(aside from metaphor)  How come the Machines can create Zion, and create a huge integral network like the Matrix, but they cant build a pole large enough that has solar panels on top that they could use to harness damn sunlight?!?!?!? What was the whole freakin' point to the  trilogy if there was a clear atmosphere above what seemed to be only 3 miles of cloud cover, why even use humans at all?!?! How come the resolution of film 3 didnt match the implication at the end of film 1, is it just to leave the door open for more sequels? When did the Wbros turn into soulless greedy B****rds!? Where can I get a blue pill, I want to be plugged back in so I can forget I bothered with this movie.<br/><br/>A.N."

No matter how good a story is, and I am of the opinion that this is one of the best that I have seen for a long time-  with some minor glitches  if you elevate expectations to such a high level as is the case here, expect some disappointment. In reviewing this movie, I shall outline some of the factors that have contributed to the wide range of differing opinions. <br/><br/>Characters and their problems provide impetus for the story. Without these elements, there is no story. This is obvious, but there is a point to be made here. Therefore the makeup of the characters and the problems that they have to solve will virtually be the sole source of success or failure. In Revolutions' the problems that the characters encounter are of great magnitude thus keeping the audience spellbound. It is therefore the characters themselves, that is, the changes that they have undergone as a consequence of their past experiences that should be the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Neo is the movie's hero and it is his journey that the audience is most concerned with. He will lead to story to its ultimate resolution. The most important character change here is that he is more vulnerable and not the superhero that he was in Reloaded'. Neo faces his challenge as a man and not as a digital entity. Hence the obstacles that he faces are more daunting. The problem with this is that much of the action that he was involved with in Reloaded' was not evident until the climatic scenes. In fact, Neo has far less screen time than the previous two chapters. This is also true of the other two central characters  that of Trinity and Morpheus. The directors may be looking to the future and in a sense passing the torch' of the Matrix' story to other characters. It did much to make Revolutions' a better story since it involved more characters with greater problems, but it certainly did not appeal to fans of the past two chapters.<br/><br/>Trinity's character did not change much from Reloaded', except for the cut back in screen time, but Morpheus changed dramatically from the previous chapters. Now he is far more uncertain about the path of The One' and as a consequence is not the ever present strong leader. Other characters take over this role as the strong leader as Morpheus is relegated in status. What this did was to take control away from the one leader who believed that he had the answer to the ending of the war. It created tension for the audience since leaders less visionary than Morpheus controlled the actions of the defenders of Zion. The idea has a sound foundation in reason, but it did weaken the character of Morpheus who was central to the story. A better balance could have been obtained by giving him more support from some of the top leaders. This would have created greater character conflict and would have not undermined the threat of the machines.<br/><br/>Another big change was that of the composition of the action. The others were kung  fu orientated and this one was largely a straight shoot  out. This meant that much of the signature special effects were minimally apparent here. The special effects that were now on show were very good and did much to display the power that the machines possessed. But this alienated fans of the signature special effects who may have felt deprived of what bought them much enjoyment.<br/><br/>Not only its composition, but its duration has changed as well. This is particularly evident from the opening scene where Neo is trapped between worlds whereas the other chapters opened up with the signature special effects and action. It was thus evident from the start that the story was going to move much slower thus emphasizing a dramatic build up rather than continuous action. This allowed for the development of other characters which further evidenced the continuing story of the Matrix'. This change to the action would not have been what many would have expected. It is probably the downturn in action which is the source of most disappointment to many users.<br/><br/> Over the course of a long story, there will be changes to allow for character development of the heroes and also for the introduction of new characters. Character changes are very difficult. These changes are inevitable to the continuing story and the characters we see in later chapters will be different to the ones that started the adventure. A balance is thus necessary. The basic nature of the heroes needs to be retained in order to keep their mass appeal. In meeting this balance some of the changes were not appealing. The one that did not appeal to me was that of Morpheus. This is also due to the fact that Lawrence Fishburne has a natural leadership charisma and this strength was thus underscored. In essence, his basic nature was not adequately retained.<br/><br/>The introduction of new characters is necessary in order to stimulate audience interest and to add freshness to the story. It is the addition of the leaders of the resistance that was disappointing. They were emotionally one  dimensional and were not good for the Morpheus character in terms of undermining his strong leadership appeal. This was probably also due to the fact that they wanted to project gutsy fighters for the invasion, but it was at the expense of one of the central characters of the story.<br/><br/>The wide range of opinions regarding this movie is almost as interesting as the movie itself. That is why I have dedicated most of my comments to the reasons for this. A story which is going to be bigger than the characters necessitated a gradual progression into the introduction of new characters and the ending of the adventures of our old heroes. This meant that Revolutions' was going to have a greater mixture of action and drama. Revolutions' was thus a step above Reloaded' in terms of story, but as a consequence lacked enough of the spellbinding, imaginative impact of the original. On the whole it was a fitting conclusion to the story and the many questions that were left unanswered will be a subject for the continuance of this great story."

","I, apparently along with millions of other viewers, thought that the first Matrix movie was interesting and stimulating enough to cover the flaws. The acting was pretty good, the concept, while not exactly new, was presenting in a refreshing manner, and the special effects and camera work were excellent. This was in 1999. In the four years that separated the first movie from the other two, nothing appears to have changed in the Wachowski universe. The final two movies are so much alike that they can be viewed as one long, progressively depressing film. Depressing because it becomes apparent that none of the really interesting questions will be answered. I can handle an open-ended film, provided that the questions asked are interesting enough to make me think about the movie afterward and ponder the possibilities. The Matrix 2 + 3 do not succeed in this capacity, in my opinion. Rather than deal with the interesting questions regarding the fate of a messiah in a machine-dominated world, we introduce new characters, have CGI-heavy fight sequences for no apparent plot-related reason, and generally p*** off everyone who isn't a die-hard fan. My advice to everyone I meet who hasn't seen the last (two) movie(s) is this: skip it. Your imagination will provide a MUCH more satisfying ending than the Wachowski brothers have managed. It is a sad statement that of the three possibly great trilogies running concurrently (Matrix, Star Wars and LOTR), only the Lord of the Rings did not drop the ball. I'm not interested in starting a fight between Matrix fanboys and RingNuts, and I'm aware that the final installment of the Star Wars prequel trilogy hasn't been produced yet, however it's probably safe to assume that it will suck as badly as the Matrix final installment, which is saying quite a bit. Shame on the Wachowskis for becoming infatuated with special effects and shying away from cleaning up the mess they created."

","Warning may contain spoilers<br/><br/>A boring, essentially special effects driven action movie, that lacks the mysticism and solid scripting of the original. To me it was just a standard sci-fi. The action scenes in this particularly the battle at the Dock and in the Tunnels were so long, and removed from the theme of the original that they were simply dull. What made this different from the second was that there were no moments of incomprehensible dialogue, but continuous action. I am unsure if this was a good thing or a bad thing, however neither were any good.<br/><br/>While special effects are highly present in The Lord of the Rings, they are used where necessary and the triology is not reliant on them, as it is also moved along by the solid story and characters. All three concepts carry the story, with the first merely assisting the other two which are most important. The same could be said for Harry Potter. Any themes that the Matrix tried to convey were lost in the overboard action and special effects, and poor script. So much work was put into the action sequences and effects, it was though they were compensations for lack of story and used to fill in time. Effects are taken for granted these days, and can be boring if there are no descent accompaniments to them. There were so many they were not impressive.<br/><br/>It seemed the basic plot was Neo awaiting his final duel with Smith after Smith had reached the height of his power, and long fights. I was so bored with it all I was sympathetic to the machines hoping that they would drill through the dock. There was so much imagery in this I felt like I was drowning in it.<br/><br/>The ending in the film itself was good, but I didn't come out feeling rewarded.

","I have read many reviews of The Matrix Revolutions and I see two distinct sets of views regarding this movie. The people who feel this movie (and the other two, for that matter) were about science fiction or action are, for the most part, let down by the way the story unfolds. People who see beyond the action genre label and watch these movies for the story, philosophy, and the thought put into them see an amazing metaphorical epic for our time. The wonderful thing about metaphorical stories is that they can be viewed and enjoyed (or not) by both groups of people. I think that anyone who ONLY sees this trilogy as a series of action flicks will be disappointed. I know that people who see this as a philosophical adventure really enjoyed it. It all depends on how you choose to look at it.<br/><br/>With that said, this movie does a fabulous job of tying up the loose ends from the previous two movies. The arc of the story remains true and the motivation for the characters is revealed/explained. The thing about trilogies is that each movie relies on the others. Some people want to judge each individual movie on its own and I just do not agree with that criteria. I go in with the idea that most stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end. I view trilogies in the same way. This movie is a fabulous ending to an enjoyable and extremely thought provoking story."

","SPOILERS!! The Matrix was undoubtedly the best one in the series. It was captivating with all the philosophical inputs. Reloaded created new questions. Revolutions promised to answer them. How well it did that is a big question.<br/><br/>Revolutions opens where Reloaded stops, with Neo in Coma along with Bane (whose mind is actually that of a copy of Smith). Neo's mind is held captive by the Trainman who is a follower of the Merovingian. Neo meets an Indian Family that gives him some fundas about ""Karma"" Neo sees no way that he can escape from the world of the Trainman, a world that is sandwitched between the Machine-world and the Matrix. Neo wonders how he is able to separate his mind and the body. Then he is told that the powers of the one Extend beyond the Matrix. Morpheus, Trinity and Seraph meet the Merovingian at the Hell Night Club where he is with his (beautiful) persephone. After a lot of kicking around and firing, they are able to Force the Merovingian to Release Neo's mind. He then meets the Oracle and learns that Smith is his Negative double. Smith is busy copying himlself throughout the matrix.<br/><br/>Bane too wakes up from his Coma and acts strange. He does not answer the Captian's questions. Later he kills the Doctor who was treating him. Neo and Tinity take Niobe's ship to the machine world. Niobe gives it coz of the faith she has in Neo as a person and not because he is the one or something. Meanwhile on the Ship, Bane/Smith blinds Neo and Neo can see only in Yellow/Red of what is his enemy in the machine world.<br/><br/>One one hand, Zion prepares itself for the attack. The gigantic Robots maket it look like a Gigantic Video-game rather than serious action. Niobe and Morpheus steer the other ship back home though crevices. Anyway, Niobe looks decent in the movie. Zion is penentrated by the machines that are digging and thousands of squiddies come out of those drilled holes into zion. The infantry does its best. So does Zee's team that destroys the Drilling machines.<br/><br/>Neo and Trinity on the surface of the Earth in the Machine City, face a lot of squiddies. But he destroys them with the power of the one. Neo and Trinity take a sharp surge into the sky, see the sun and then plunge back into the atmosphere (God knows how hovercrafs can fly in such altitudes).<br/><br/>Back at Zion, Niobe rushes back to the Dock at Zion after a heroic stunt by the kid on the Infantry Robot and trigger the EMP that kills all squiddies. That destroys a lot of Hardware at Zion which infuriates Commander Lock. Soon, they prepare for an another attack with swarms of squiddies coming in.<br/><br/>On the Surface, at the machine City, the hovercraft crashes, killing trinity. Later Neo meets the master of all machines that does not kill him because there is a purpose out of him. The program Smith that the machines had created in the Matrix had grown out of proportions and he was all set to destroy the matrix and achieve his verson of freedom. Only the One can confront him and the Machines promise peace on the condition that he Destroys Smith.<br/><br/>Neo is Plugged into the Matrix and the final Showdown between Neo and Smith begins. After a lot of flying and crashing, smashing and punching, Neo tricks Smith to saying ""Everything that has a beginning has an End"". Neo lets Smith copy himself into him and then destroys it; finally killing the Smith Program.<br/><br/>Later, the Matrix is rewritten with all people returning to their normal form. Machines leave zion peacefully. Neo is still in the Machine world and people in Zion and Matrix talk of him as if he was god. The closing credits start with the prayer ""Asatoma Satgamaya...""<br/><br/>So, ends the Trilogy. Any further comments and discussions are welcome..."

","Finally, after 4 years in the making, the end of this generation's biggest Sci-Fi parable has landed. But is it what we dreamt of? I don't think it is. `The Matrix' shook us up but its sequel shook it back down. I found `The Matrix Reloaded' far too bloated and not up to strength with it's 1999 predecessor but, was hoping for deliverance within the final chapter. But alas, `The Matrix Revolutions' can't salvage a weary franchise or redeem it. Mistakes in the past only amplify in the future and what we are left with is a myth now hollowed out to an empty shell, not even worthy of it's own exciting concept.<br/><br/>So what went wrong? For those of you who have seen all three films then you will know that there is great strength in the story, but plenty of room to slip. The Wachowski brothers (Larry and Andy) showed us that it is still very easy to make a film that asks you to think deep and have fun as well. But over time, with each successive chapter, the fun was drawn out. Again that is a problem reflected on the characters. Like the last one this movie fails to let the chief characters grow and be nurtured by the viewers. I find myself caring less about Neo now that he is the almighty chosen one, as it seems most unlikely that his life could ever be in any real danger  even outside the Matrix! But to add insult to injury new characters are created and discarded leaving the more substantial characters we have come to love (eg Morpheus) by the wayside. Nearly all the new characters from Reloaded are gone or gotten rid of in the blink of an eye. It would have been more sensible to develop these already established characters and put them to good use in the final plot. What a waste.<br/><br/>I don't wish the Wachowski's had never made the last two episodes (I campaigned there exciting arrival) I just wish they had handled it better. That's not to say that this film doesn't have any good qualities, it does. Technically `The Matrix Revolutions' is perfect. The visual effects are stunning and put to better use than in `Reloaded.' There are some moments that are truly amazing but nothing that stands out. The last two films had some classic scenes that showed you just why these films are unique but there is none of that here. The rain drenched battle between Neo and Agent Smith and the end of `Revolutions' is fitting but not as epic as say the 19-minute highway chase or the high wire rescue in the first film.<br/><br/>Any hint of originality is gone. It's way too serious for it's own good. All joy has been sucked out and overlooks that simple element from the original that I miss very much. I think that's what upsets me more than anything. Are the Wachowski's that good a storyteller or did coincidence and luck give them a winning film in `The Matrix' way back then? Maybe that's the teaser, not philosophy, Gnosticism, Buddhism, folklore or any other kind of global mythology entwined in here.<br/><br/>Score - 3 out of 5"
"Neoromeo","Null","0","0","3 January 2004"," Just like I imagined
","After seeing ""The Matrix Revolutions"" I made sure to come online as soon as possible to see where I left off with my review of ""Reloaded."" I ended the latter review predicting, but hoping against the Wachowskis collapsing under the weight of their material. Now that I've seen the final instalment in the ""Matrix"" trilogy, my own prophecy was correct - the Wachowskis tank, and they tank hard. This film makes for one of the most disappointing trilogies in film history since the Star Wars prequels (I know we have yet to see the final instalment there, but do you really think that series can resurrect itself from lines like, ""We live in a real world! Come back to it!"") The looser ends created by ""Reloaded"" have an attempted mending in ""Revolutions,"" and they fit to some degree, but they don't make a tight whole. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss sing a swan song for their careers in ""The Matrix Revolutions.""<br/><br/>250,000 sentinels have begun digging down into Zion, one for every man, woman and child in the last surviving human city, and all the humans have on their side are hope, mech warrior and a whole lotta bullets. And oh yes, there's Neo, but by this point he's become little more than a vegetable, having passed out and sunk into limbo after a face-to-face confrontation with a sentinel at the end of ""Reloaded."" Also, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has uploaded himself into the real world via the body of Bane (Ian Bliss), a soldier on a ship fighting alongside the Nebuchadnezzar.<br/><br/>
Neo wakes up, finding himself in the Mobil train station (an anagram for Limbo) unable to leave at the behest of the Trainman (Bruce Spence) in the most gripping scene of the film. Trinity, Morpheus and Seraph (Sing Ngai), the Oracle's bodyguard from the first film, are left with the task to get him out, forced to make quick work of the Trainman and bring Neo back to the real world. The fate of humanity hangs in the balance, of course. Meanwhile, Trinity and Morpheus are forced to dispose of the Merovingian, which the Wachowskis solve by dropping him out of the story without resolution. Easy as that.<br/><br/>The human resistance arms itself for battle amongst all this philosophical banter, and is set into the most draining action scene of the series as they are set upon by the machines in the forms of enormous drills which allow them a path into Zion. The human race tries as it might to stop the onslaught by the use of Mech Warrior-like machines that unload clip after clip against them. They enjoy some success, but cannot defeat the machines alone - they require the help of Neo, who has committed himself to enter the Machine City (01, for those who've not yet watched ""Animatrix: The Second Renaissance"") so that he may negotiate a peace with the central brain of the Machines, appropriately called Deus Ex Machina (Henry Blasingame).<br/><br/>
In the Matrix, Agent Smith has copied himself into an army of... well, himself, and is infecting programs of the Matrix each time he copies himself again. He has now gone rogue and fights no longer with the Machines who created him - humans and machines have a common enemy, and Neo is the only one who can stop him and, hopefully, secure a peace for Zion. This negotiation will culminate in the answers to everyone's questions, to Neo's fate and purpose, the future of humanity, and whether everything the Architect told him at the end of ""Reloaded"" was true. To recap quickly, the purpose of ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is to answer for us if Zion will be destroyed a sixth time and if Neo will survive it and begin a new Zion so that it can be destroyed once more. The humans and Neo have much to fear, for the Machines have destroyed Zion five times already and have become ""increasingly efficient at it.""<br/><br/>""The Matrix Revolutions"" has been passed off by most critics and audiences as a terrible movie that does not tie up any loose ends that were made loose by ""Reloaded."" This is not completely true, but may seem so to anyone who does not understand what the ""Matrix"" trilogy is based on. The best way to understand the story is to see it in Biblical terms, seeing the Real World as Heaven and the Matrix as Hell. Agent Smith and his minions were cast out of Heaven for defying the natural order (by surviving after being destroyed) and have embarked on their own agenda. The Machines want to punish humanity with complete destruction (Genesis Flood story) for having helped him come back to a level of strength that rivals the Machines, and Neo, the obvious Jesus figure, is the only one who can save humanity by defeating Smith. Neo and Smith coexist as an unbalanced equation kept that way by the Oracle (Mary Alice) and the defeat of one over the other would balance that equation. Hence, the future of humanity hangs in the balance.<br/><br/>The trilogy tells a very interesting story, filled with allusions to mythology, religion and philosophy, but ultimately fails to deliver the closure that its fans, audiences and critics were hoping for. This is due partially to the quality of the writing which is, well, terrible. Just as Roger Ebert said it himself, in the first film Agent Smith was the only one who spoke in monotone - in ""Revolutions,"" everyone does. And it's annoying. Smith was an interesting character even when he spoke in such a monotonous voice, but that does not mean the human characters had any place to do the same thing. Now none of the characters mean anything to the audiences and therefore their hearts are not in keeping with the goals of the films.<br/><br/>This is not to say the film is a failure on all counts. There are some very interesting scenes, particular the opening sequence in Mobil, where the Trainman, paralleling the Boatman on the River Styx, refuses to allow the savior to leave and save his people. Even the philosophical ramblings have some merit here, but these are soon forgotten as the central characters head to Club Hell to drop the Merovingian and his wife Persephone from the story. The final battle sequence, as well, between Smith and Neo reaches momentary grandeur as Neo approaches his enemy in a torrential rainfall, all of his minions staring him down from all sides on the street and in the windows of buildings leading up to the big fight. The Battle of Zion is equally spectacular, but it is so long-winded, loud, and obnoxious it's boring. It's basically this movie's version of the Smiths battle in ""Reloaded.""<br/><br/>At the end of the film, people all over complain that nothing has been explained, but that is only because they must not be aware of the story it is trying to tell. Loose ends are tied together, but no one cares. The beauty of the original ""Matrix"" is that it told a story under a noirish cloak, and by this film has erupted into the action epic of a lifetime. It doesn't pull that off at all, partially due to the competition from another trilogy, but also that the trilogy loses its appeal some way, somehow by the final film. It is a wonder whether our race will be saved, but we just don't care anymore. 2 stars on a five star scale."

","I would like to open with the simple facts. A man, woman, or child that has not seen the original Matrix is a rarity in the United States. Therefore the fact that Revolutions is only good if youve seen (and understood) the first one is irrelevant. Revolutions takes place roughly six and a half months after The Matrix and directly after The Matrix:Reloaded. Neo finds himself in the area between the Matrix and the real world. What follows is an epic battle between man and machine, complete with mechs, infantry and giant dino-bots (weird ill admit). The whole theme of the movie is the frailty of life. For those too incompetent to see that i pity you. The way that Trinity gives her life so that Neo can fulfill his destiny shows amazing loyalty. Neo gives his life so that the human race can go on (an obvious symbol for Jesus Christ). With all the hidden things, the amazing effects, unbelievable storyline, and tender human relationships one begins to wonder who it is that does not like this wonderful piece of cinema. The point is brought up that Revolutions doesnt have the same eye popping Special effects as the matrix. First of all its not true (Smith/Neo fight people?) and second of all the effects have been done.

I'm really sick of people blaming everything they don't understand on ""plot holes"".  The Matrix trilogy is grossly misunderstood.  If there is anything the story teaches us, it is that there are no spoon fed answers.  No one can be told what the Matrix is, the experience is figuring it out for yourself.

Did no one tell the Wachowskis that the third film in a trilogy is supposed to top the two that came before?<br/><br/>In my opinion, doing two sequels was unnecessary. If they had have condensed the story slightly (and let's face it, there was barely enough story for one movie between the two sequels as it was), included the Freeway chase and the attack on Zion as the two major action sequences (perhaps shortened slightly), and used the burly brawl as the final fight, then The Matrix would have had a fitting finale.<br/><br/>What's wrong with a 'duology' anyway?"

","After the crushing disappointment of Matrix Reloaded, I allowed myself a cautious hope that the final chapter will manage to redeem the trilogy that started off so well. While in many ways Revolutions is an improvement on its predecessor (no fake CGI shots this time around, for one thing), it still hasn't convinced me that the original film needed sequels in the first place. In fact the third film feels like a mere continuation of the second and not a part of a cohesive trilogy. It inherits its cheesy 3rd-rate-Star-Trek-episode elements like the godawful Zion council and tedious committee scenes. Worse, it doesn't really bother to answer any questions, instead serving up a rather anti-climatic ending that makes a mockery of everything the human rebels were fighting for in the first film.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if it even deserves to have ""Matrix"" in its title when it is in reality a fairly standard sci-fi pic with Matrix bits glued to it. The bulk of the film is focussed on Zion and the battle to defend the city, and while it is spectacular enough, I just felt no particular urge to cheer for a bunch of generic, interchangeable characters. I found Zion and its inhabitants unlikeable in Reloaded, and, Jada Pinkett's fiery Niobe aside, they remain so in Revolutions, too.<br/><br/>Oh, and what about whatshisname, Neo? Well, he, Trinity and Morpheus are basically guest stars in their own movie, disappearing off the screen for long stretches of time. Morpheus, a king of cool in the original, has zilch all to do except stand behind Niobe's shoulder and look worried. It is a testament to the efforts of the actors that Neo and Trinity still managed to make me care about them, but in the end of the day they simply have nothing to sink their teeth into. Hugo Weaving seems to be the only one around having fun with his role, sneering, hissing and overacting gleefully and most entertainingly.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the philosophical and religious aspects of the Matrix, but to me stuffing a film with a bunch of clever references and solemn questions doesn't automatically make it intelligent or deep. Concept is one thing, but execution is another, and where the first film was successful in marrying the brains with the brawn, Reloaded and Revolutions often come off as exercises in lame noodling about. Oracle's speech explaining her changed appearance is a prime example; completely pointless and making no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>On a plus side, the visuals are pretty damn neat and stunning in places; not enough to justify this film's existance though."

","The Matrix franchise started off very big and very well, creating a social phenomenon unseen since psycho, the introduction of anime to the ""west"" and, I hope . In 1999, the online community boomed with matrix sites and personal theory pages. The Matrix was an open book.<br/><br/>With Matrix reloaded, many of the theories from the large online cult were abolished while some fewer theories started. TMReloaded made the Matrix's transition from sci-fi ""make you think"" to sci-fi ""make you watch"". Many fans were quite disappointed but still had hope for a better movie, a better ending.<br/><br/>TMRevolutions abolished most of that hope because the franchise was so concentrated on an ""enjoyable"" flick they forgot to make it a ""good"" and masterful movie. They did not leave many doors open and closed a lot of them. The ending of the movie had a bit of corniness to it as well. Many movie stereotypes were also included in TMRevolutions (huge final battle of good vs evil, someone important dies tha people will supposedly miss, etc.). This combined with the poorly written ending  leaves matrix fans asking ""what the?"" and leaving most people stupefied the wrong way, the way in which moviegoers go ""was that the real ending?"". I felt as if to fullfill the Matrix demand, andy and larry went lazy to write the end under what some think as a short period. The franchise' success sort of got to them and it shows through this movie.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that this movie was a complete flop, but it did fail to give originality to an original plot.

","'The Matrix Revolutions' has a conclusion to its story that is somewhat hazy and not clear cut.  But that's Hollywood!  Never say that a trilogy can't be turned into four films.  It's unlikely judging by the disappointing financial and critical outcome this film had which did not live up to expectations but the series ends in a mostly satisfying manner.  My beef with this and 'The Matrix Reloaded' is that meaningful character interaction and deeper development did not take place.  It's not hard to see but as a visual feast, the third film has most of the eye candy.  The second film has some buzzing thrills but the first film will always be the best in the series.

"GabeShadow","Null","0","0","2 January 2004"," Contradicts Enter The Matrix's intentions of preluding the movie
","I first watched Matrix Reloaded and played Enter The Matrix to understand the full story, expecting for a good ending, and hopefully giving Niobe (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Ghost (Anthony Wong) much larger parts in the movie. <br/><br/>Let's see where we left off previously:<br/><br/>Matrix Reloaded: Neo (Keanu Reeves) is told by the Architect that the prophecy was a lie and there were five previous versions of the Matrix, but also has to choose one of the two doors. One door to save Zion, and another to save Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). Neo chooses to save Trinity, and tells Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)and Link (Harold Perrineau Jr.) about his conversation with the Architect. The Sentinels find their location and blew up the Nebuchadnezzar. Neo manages to destroy the Sentinels with his recently-created powers, but results him going into a coma. Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, and Link were rescued by the crew of the Hammer, a crew led by Roland (David Roberts). Roland explains what had happened recently, including an EMP incident. They found one survivor, who turns out to be Bane (Ian Bliss).<br/><br/>Enter The Matrix: Shortly after destroying the Power Plant, all hell started to break loose, and the player is given glimpses that Bane was actually responsible for the EMP and killing his crewmates.  The crew of the Logos get a call from Seraph (Sing Ngai a.k.a. Collin Chou.)  Seraph says he brings word from the Oracle and that they must come at once. Niobe volunteers to go to the Oracle and defeats Seraph.  Niobe meets the Oracle (with Mary Alice playing the role for the first time) and is not sure if the Oracle is not the Oracle. After Niobe is convinced of the Oracle's new identity, Niobe asks what happened. The Oracle explains to Niobe that the Merovingian became furious after finding out that she decided to help Neo and needed to change her appearance.  Niobe asks what happened to Neo. The Oracle tells her that Neo touched the Source and separated his mind from his body (while Neo disabled the Sentinels).  Niobe asks if she can free him, and the Oracle told her that Trinity is capable of saving Neo, but will `have to fight her way through hell to do it.' Niobe asks if she could help, and the Oracle replied that is why she called the Logos. She is not sure what is going to happen (namely Smith's on-going rampage in the Matrix). The Oracle said that she cannot see beyond the end. Niobe tries to correct the Oracle only Neo could do that. The Oracle said `I mean we.' She tells Niobe that the path of the one is made by the many and that they all have an important role to play. As Niobe leaves, she gets pursued by dozens of Agent Smiths (Hugo Weaving) and eventually leaves the Matrix. Things get worse as a group of Sentinels found the Logos. Niobe focuses on piloting the Logos away from the Sentinels as far as possible while Ghost focuses on shooting down the Sentinels. The Logos soon hits a dead-end and triggers the EMP, stranding the crew for the time being.<br/><br/>Main story for Revolutions: The crew of the Hammer look at the Matrix screen still trying to search for Niobe and Ghost. As the medic continued to examine Neo and Bane, she started to notice the cuts on Bane's arm, arousing suspicion about him, and the readings of Neo is at a position only possible if he is inside the Matrix. The Hammer gets a call from Seraph. Trinity and Morpheus are told of the situation of what has happened to Neo and they would have to find the Trainman, with Seraph accompanying them.  After a few battles, Neo is reunited with everyone else, but visits the Oracle to learn about what he has to do.  Moments after exiting the Matrix, the Hammer finds the Logos.<br/><br/>After a long amount of time alone, Neo decides he has to head to Zero-One, the machine city (the same Zero-One from the Animatrix). After some conflicts, Niobe decides to lend the Logos to Neo. Neo and the rest of his allies go their separate ways, with Trinity accompanying him. Niobe, Ghost, Morpheus, Link, Sparks (Lachy Hulme), and the crew of the Hammer attempt to return to Zion.  The main objective becomes clear to Neo: ask for peace with the machines while ending Smith's threat in the Matrix, while the Zion Resistance forces tries to protect Zion as much as they can<br/><br/>I had other expectations for the movie, but it turns out that Niobe and Ghost's roles in the movie have once again been minor, but had slightly larger roles (with only Enter The Matrix emphasizing that their tasks are important.). The only action given to the two is getting the crew back to Zion with Niobe as the main pilot while Ghost is one of the gunners (I expected Niobe and Ghost to help Morpheus, Trinity, and Seraph out in the Matrix at least.).<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with the movie is the battle with Agent Smith, although the fight was long and as dramatic as possible, the fight started to rip off the Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z anime series. What were Larry and Andy Wachowski thinking when doing the finale of the movie? As for the ending:<br/><br/>(SPOILERS)<br/><br/>The Matrix is NOT destroyed. The Wachowski brothers wanted to create The Matrix Online, a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game and are in the process of creating it along with Ubi Soft.<br/><br/>(end spoilers)<br/><br/>Hopefully, the loose ends will be tied up (for example how is Sati's role important and how big of an impact would she have on both worlds [The Oracle said that if the player met the Oracle as Ghost.]?)<br/><br/>Story review overall: The story is less confusing and slightly tied up the loose ends of Matrix Reloaded, but the con is that they made a few references to Enter The Matrix, and an average movie-goer is not aware of the game so he or she might feel lost in a way (if the audience only sticks with watching the movies alone, they won't get the FULL story.). It is HIGHLY advisable to play Enter The Matrix (or look for the transcript of it at www.gamefaqs.com) and to watch Animatrix to get the full Matrix story (Just watch Kid's Story, both parts of Second Renaissance, and Final Flight Of The Osiris.)<br/><br/>Story disappointments and what COULD HAVE been changed and added:<br/><br/>Changes:<br/><br/><ul><li>Have the Hammer find the Logos before Trinity and Morpheus go into the Matrix and have Niobe and Ghost accompany them (well, on the other hand, I guess they really needed a break since they went through a lot of events in Enter The Matrix and Matrix Reloaded)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Add some more jokes from Sparks (the `Wipe the windshield while you're at it' line is just not enough)?</li></ul><br/><br/>
<ul><li>Try to show what happened to the crew of the Hammer, and the other gunners (including Ghost)</li></ul><br/><br/>Additions:<br/><br/><ul><li>Tie up the loose ends between Trinity's relationship with Ghost. In Enter The Matrix, the players get the message that Trinity and Ghost were close friends and have a brother-sister relationship, but the video game player finds out that Ghost has feelings for Trinity and starts to fall in love with her (at least a good-bye scene between the two?).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Try to show what happened to Neo. Was he killed or just plain unconscious? - Is Niobe's relationship with Lock, or Morpheus (the game gave us mixed messages on this.)?</li></ul><br/><br/>Acting: A minor gripe I had is that Neo barely had emotions almost through-out the whole movie, except:<br/><br/>(Spoilers again)<br/><br/>When Trinity dies on him. The rest of the cast did quite a great job.<br/><br/>Overall: The story just gets a `good' rating.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."

","Even seeing Matrix Revolutions on an IMAX screen couldn't disguise the fact that the Wachowski Brothers had run out of gas.  It's not that the film is so bad, as many have claimed, it's just not nearly as creative as the Matrix or even Reloaded.  Nothing in Revolutions will surprise you, which makes it a disappointing conclusion to one of the most imaginative film worlds ever created.  <br/><br/>On a positive note, it doesn't pander to the kiddies or devolve into the pathetically commercial manner of Return of the Jedi, with its Hallmark Ewoks and toy catalog film style.  Now THAT was a terrible conclusion to a trilogy.  At least the Wachowski Brothers stayed true to the tone they developed in the first two films, which counts for something.  In a few years, the torrents of criticism about Revolutions will probably subside, and people will realize that this was a capably made film and that the three parts do form a fairly seamless whole.<br/><br/>Having said that, the Wachowskis would have been better off making one 3 hour sequel to the original movie, instead of stretching out a story they didn't have the inspiration or drive to maintain at the highest level."
"atomicblue","Null","0","0","22 December 2003"," The Matrix, Repetitions...
","Don't worry, you don't need to brace yourselves - much - I'm not about to slag this off as a bad movie. I'm certainly not about to declare it as anything great or remotely special, but the first thing that begs to be said about this flick is that it is not bad, just stale. The first entry into the series was a quality film, despite some flaws. The two extensions to the series in 2003 were just that: extensions. Flicks. Slightly sub-standard action fare mixed with slightly above-standard special effects.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Revolutions more than Reloaded, most probably because I had already been exposed to the considerable problems that weighed down the last movie. That is, the pretentious philosophising, special effects that crossed the line between grandiose and downright excess, and obsessively slick atmosphere. The fact that these flaws were just as prevalent again may have been worth taking points off for, but I was really quite resigned to it.<br/><br/>
Points were lost instead for new problems that dragged the series down further - although I suspect these were issues that started with Reloaded that I was too crushed to notice. For one, the film's actors display a frustrating reluctance to imbue their characters with any significant emotion. There are some emotive moments - rare as they may be, but the characters are generally rather sullen and cold. More time is spent with the characters describing their feelings, when it should be enough for them to show it, and wanting the characters to show some feelings, given their extreme situations, shouldn't be considered expecting too much. This is the fault of the writers, who will no doubt be forgiven for it anyway seeing as people are still so blinded by the fact that they have created ONE particularly interesting movie. It is also the fault of the actors, who vary in the degree to which they offend on these grounds - Carrie-Anne Moss again shows that she deserves better work than this, while Laurence Fishburne's performance is almost completely pointless. Reeves falls in between, although it must be said that he is capable of much more than this, as films like The Gift can attest.<br/><br/>There are highlights - Merovingian is again priceless, although Persephone is reduced to background here, which is disappointing given her seductive turn in Reloaded. There are some spectacular moments, too, particularly during the 45-minute assault on the city of Zion. Unfortunately, the length of the sometimes-spectacular action sequences reduces them to hackneyed exercises in special effects.<br/><br/>The biggest problem, however, for one of the most ridiculously hyped films of all time, is that there is far too much going on here - too many characters and too many loose ends to be wrapped up. The Wachowski Brothers fail to manage the film's time, with several characters, such as Niobe and Link, failing to develop, while many of the action sequences, as in the last film, are given far too much time. <br/><br/>What destroys the credibility of the film, however, is the realisation that everything was better off left unanswered, with the first movie delivering a visual feast and a suitably cryptic ending. The second and third instalments coming nowhere near the ingénue of the original's special effects, and fail to measure up to even the flimsy story that the first film offered. The issue then that defeats Revolutions - which settles for the oft-treaded standard big-budget action-flick - is the fact that the it would have been better off never being made.<br/><br/>

","Perhaps we can blame the overblown attitude of the studio management, but does everything need to be a trilogy.  It occurs to me that ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" might have been quite good as a single film.  As two films, they are ponderous, meandering and pointless.<br/><br/>My history is this:  I loved ""The Matrix"".  I considered it a revolutionary blend of disparate cinematic sources.  While no piece of it was truly original, the combination of elements was.  There is still nothing like it...sadly, not even its own sequels.  ""Reloaded"" was a massive disappointment, and I felt that at least it had left its final chapter with nowhere to go but up.  After nothing but lead-up and dangling plot threads, ""Revolutions"" had to be a step up.<br/><br/>I was so very wrong.<br/><br/>""The Matrix Revolutions"" is a big, loud stupid redneck of a movie.  The mis-steps here are so catastrophically boneheaded in nature that I find it difficult to believe that the men behind ""The Matrix"" and ""Bound"" could have conceived it.  It is interested only in creating big, loud battle sequences, letting them go on far too long, and ending them in as disappointing a manner as possible.<br/><br/>To begin with, the first rule of creating a tense battle sequence is in making us care about the characters involved.  So what do they do?  They make certain that none of the characters we've followed through the previous films are even IN these battles.  Instead, we spend a good twenty minutes watching no one we care about scream and fire machine guns at endless hoardes of robots.  Meanwhile, Morpheus, the spiritual leader of the human race, is playing Ensign Chekov to Jada Pinkett while Neo, the savior of humanity, gets in a dull fistfight with a possessed crewman.<br/><br/>In addition there is the recasting of the Oracle.  It seems to me that there were two reasonable tactics here: either cast a similar actress and go on as if nothing's happened, or cast someone completely different, and make it a plot point.  Sadly, they choose exactly the wrong combination of these tactics.<br/><br/>And where is the Matrix?  Wasn't that the focus of this series?  We barely see it here, being subjected instead to the dull, colorless and thoroughly uninteresting ""real world"".  Admittedly, when we finally do get jacked in, we're treated to what may be the best super-battle since ""Superman II"". Unfortunately, the ending (combined with a concept introduced in ""Reloaded"") insinuate that this was all rather pointless, since it's all going to happen all over again.  Thus, the sacrifices and struggles we've witnessed essentially mean nothing.<br/><br/>To my mind, the first film had a perfect ending, and did not beg for a sequel, let alone a trilogy.  I prefer to remember that ending, and leave the world with its possibilities open.  This simply cheapens the entire idea."

Even the action scenes were on the weak and flimsy side. The entire movie lacked the energy of the original. Not only that, but there was zero chemistry between the stars--who have no personality or charisma, and there was no character development at all. Since the movie put way too much emphasis on the characters, this was a serious problem. The best thing they did was put a sock over Keanu's eyes for Trinity's farewell.

This is irrelevant by the third movie. What is important is how do we affect and effect our environment is the relevant question now.

","I honestly almost fell asleep in the theater and found myself cringing during most of this movie.  What is it about the third movie in a series? All this movie needed was Ewoks.  I honestly can't remember the last time I saw so many cliches in a single movie, all of which might have been bearable if the ending actually ""ended"" something.<br/><br/>Basically, Neo saved the Matrix from Smith.  That is all. End of story. (?) I guess we are supposed to think that machines have a sense of honor and will therefore release all of the humans from the matrix because they gave their word??  The dollop of pseudo-philosophy heaped on top of the last two films in this series cannot mask the fact that the directors didn't have one original idea after the first shockingly brilliant film.  Of course, expectations were absurdly high after the success of ""The Matrix,"" but the depths that this third film plummets to are absurdly low. The ""acting,"" focus on minor characters (uh, who cares??), lack of story, almost laughable script, and over the top (and unoriginal) special effects (see ""Aliens"" and ""Superman III"") ensure that this movie will go down in history as one of the biggest let-downs ever.<br/><br/>I guess they forgot that a movie about the matrix should be...about the matrix.  I guess they forgot that the Matrix was supposed to be about ""robots and kung fu,"" as the directors once said themselves."

","I am a very big Matrix fan.  I have been intrigued since the first movie, but the final movie was disappointing to me.  It was heavy on action, but had one main plot hole that I can't get out of my head.  I am not a fan of movies that insult my intelligence, and I thought the Matrix was going to be an exception.  The first movie did and the second kept me very interested. Even the video game was fun to learn more about the Matrix.  The Animatrix was really nice with wonderful short stories, but Revolutions falls short.<br/><br/>The biggest plot hole I have with Revolutions is the lack of EMPs in and around Zion to protect it.  We are well aware of the EMPs being the ""only real defense we have against the machines"".  Then why do only the ships have them?  And if there is a special reason for the ships being the only carrying device for the EMPs, then why did they send ALL the ships in Reloaded (except the Neb, and the Logos and the Mjolnir) to attack the machines without leaving ships to defend their only city?  Have you known any strategic leader to throw all their eggs in one basket?  We learn even in chess to not leave the king unguarded.  But Commander Lock and the council agree to send all the ships and their only real defense against the machines to attack the squids, which fails leaving Zion with little defense. I would think if the human race was going to be wiped out as you know it, you would be more intelligent with your defenses.<br/><br/>Oh well, I suppose you wouldn't have had such a grand Hollywood battle if they had Zion surrounded by EMPs.  Hence my disappointment in seeing the Matrix go Hollywood and insult my intelligence. There is still much to see in the way of cinematic eye candy, if you overlook parts of the plot."

I didn't see the second one, but this was bad enough to not need a link.

Yea, the first matrix built up a lot of philosophical questions to be given such a cop-out (couldn't think of anything else) conclusion. A comparably minor point real quick......someone already pointed out,lol: why the big clumsy,immobile devices that the humans hop into to battle the machines, when all they really offer is big mechanical arms holding big machine guns? Couldn't you just mount a big machine gun somewhere, maybe somewhere with some cover(not to mention they'd have some better weapons in the future)? Ok, and no we don't care about any of the characters, esp will smith's horrible acting wife niobi. It was also very unclear what Smith gained from the oracle/what happened to her/why she didn't try and avoid him or something somehow as smith points out....i almost wish he had just grabed her all-seeing eyes out of their sockets right there. Other things which annoyed: the main commander dude of the humans, the last one to get picked off of course, was so over the top/macho persona--half the zion fight coverage was him hysterically screaming and unloading on some squiggly robot guys. oh AND MOST IMPORANTLY....smith's out of the way now right? What's to stop the machines from going back and pulverizing zion, what with the now-known location and all. This movie might as well as well have been freakin independence day.

","I see Revolutions as a great movie.<br/><br/>A few points taken from it for the beginning--which exemplifies the feeling that Reloaded and Revolutions are just one large sequel.  Which would be great if they were making a fourth movie...<br/><br/>Anyhow, I thought the movie was great (like I said before).  The effects--even better than reloaded, the action--excellent, story--very good, acting good, etc.<br/><br/>I was really looking to be underwhelmed by what I'll call the Mechs in the Zion battle (the [exoskeleton] machines the humans pilot).  I thought the ""Burly Brawl"" from Reloaded looked great, but you could tell it was an effect, the lighting was just a little off--and they may have went extreme on changing the camera angles in some cases.  That made it a little too obvious--but it looked better than so many effects I've ever seen.  Then the Mechs blew me away.  I saw it at a stadium seating theater with a huge screen.  The work on the Mechs is probably THE greatest effect I've ever seen.  It looked perfect.  EVEN when they got insane close-ups.  The preview video looked alright--but the final product was OUTSTANDING.  Same with the other effects.<br/><br/>The acting, IMO all of the Matrix movies have had good acting.  Perhaps people feel Keanu is being wooden, but I can deal with that--I feel he legitimately had questions and concerns.  The Zion scene from the last movie, AND THE ONES FROM THIS MOVIE, were great.  Less Matrix in this movie--but acceptable because of what's going on story-wise.  No need to pointlessly be in the matrix--Neo and Trinity and Morpheus do their thing, you see what happens to the Oracle and Seraph, we see that PROGRAMS actually have ""feelings and love"", etc.  If you didn't catch that, I thought the story was great too.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie seems right IMO.  Just a LITTLE underwhelming--and for some reason it seems everyone is expecting more.  I don't know--the earth being obliterated--something.  The ending leaves you wanting more [it did for me*] but it answers a lot of questions and creates some interesting questions too.  That may be its only downfall.  I thought it was a great movie though.<br/><br/>From what I heard people whining about, I though the movie was going to end as soon as Smith and Neo started fighting.  I was like NOOOO, this is so freakin great.  I was ""on the edge of my seat.""  I was like how are they going to end all this here.  Then they get to the end--which was a pretty good ending--and like I said before, leaves us with some interesting questions--and DOES answer some important questions--not right at the end, but even throughout the movie.<br/><br/>9 out of 10<br/><br/>

","Aloha, I'm a sci-fi fan and I wait for movies of this genre to appear. They are few and far between , so I relish a new movie.  The Matrix series has been one the the recent entries , and I have enjoyed all of them.  I am surprised at the recent reviews of this trilogy , especially the almost personal attacks against them. One thing I have noticed is the word ""expected"" when it comes to a viewer's preconceptions of a movie. I don't ""expect"" something ; I simply go to see where the story goes. I saw the first Matrix on a whim in Waikiki on a sunny afternoon years ago when it was released and I was impressed.  I have watched it many times since and of course became enthralled with the the whole Matix idea before the sequels.  When the sequels arrived this year , I looked forward to them as others , but I have to admit , I did not have expectations.  I only had a hope that they would carry forward the story.  I did read reviews before I journeyed to the theater and was surprise at the animosity toward the movies.  Anyway , I saw both , I thought they were entertaining ; I didn't hate the actors or their acting ; I just enjoyed the story.<br/><br/>For me , this series was one of the best sci-fi in recent years and I can't find anything that even touches it.  For the record ... my favorites recently are -- 12 monkeys , 5th Element , Solaris , The 6th Day, Minority Report.  Is there anything else out there? Tell me , well 'cause I live in the middle of nowhere. Of course the sequels could have been better , I agree , but can I ""expect"" them to blow me away every time?

","The first 'Matrix' was one of the best science fiction films that I have ever seen. The second was a failure, and I was concerned about the third being even worse. Well, for once, my concerns were not justified, and the final (is it final really?) movie in the series without being as good as the first one is not a bad movie at all. <br/><br/>On the bad side, there is nothing too original or too unexpected in this series. It very much continues the second part, and I remember having read that the authors consider the two last parts as one film. Some of the pseudo-philosophy could have been avoided, and the symbols are not that deep as the authors would like us to believe. Overall, this 'quality' part of the story and film is the weakest. <br/><br/>Now the good side. The action is really good, and the effects are as good as you can get with the technical means of the beginning of the 21st century. It may come as surprise, but the real art in this film is in the good cinema created by the effects. Some good acting helps, casting is good excepting Monica Belucci - I cannot imagine why such an exquisite and beautiful actress accepted to play this purely decorative role - Maybe she just wanted to be part of the movie?<br/><br/>The film got a lot of bad critics, and I do not really understand why. Maybe it is because of the high expectations the first 'Matrix' created. In any case, it is not bad at all, and the trilogy gets a good ending, although not an exceptional one. Yes, the Wachowsky brothers can do better, and the audiences are waiting for better from them. This one gets an 8/10 on my personal scale."

","Oh dear Oh dear.. I really didn't like this film at all. To be quite honest I think Revolutions is like a boulder chained to the feet of the previous two films before they're thrown over the bridge into the river... I honestly wish Revolutions had never been made, it marred the experience of the first two so much..<br/><br/>Anyway.. why do I feel like this? Am I just band-wagon jumping here? Well here's my reasoning..<br/><br/>The first film is generally expected to be a masterwork of cinema. A modern classic if you will. It was a damn good movie. It had style, it had flare, it had action, it had plot and it had enough little hidden subtexts to make you want to see it till your tv screen burned out. The second one got slated but in my opinion it was exactly what people should have expected, the first film, only blown up onto a big scale. Whereas the first film focussed upon a select group of people, the second pulled back to show us the full scale of the conflict. It had complex (some would say pretentious?) sub-plots and again, it was fun to watch.<br/><br/>So Revolutions. Ack ack ack... My first gripe is that it's barely Matrix. There's hardly any of the Matrix in it, and what we do see consists of *POSSIBLE SPOILER* about 20 minutes in a bleak train station and an underwhelming and often ridiculous duel between Neo and Agent Smith with a predictable conclusion *END OF SPOILER*. The rest of the film is spent either watching hovercraft buzz around the place (admittedly the chase through the mechanical line is quite impressive) or daft looking mechanical combat suits shooting at a seemingly endless swarm of sentinels while their pilots constantly shout battle cries before being torn to bits one by one. How nice... this smells way too much like generic C-grade Sci-Fi to me, not the Grade A material that the original film and Reloaded have lead us to expect. It also seemed to have a ridiculous amount of plot holes. Who the hell was Seraph, what happened when Seraph and the girl get confronted by the Smiths? What was the effect of Smith absorbing the Oracle? And over-all... WHY THE HELL did you give us such an underwhelming ending? I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, although to be honest I'd recommend not seeing it at all since it will mar your experience of the other two films. I genuinely wish I hadn't seen it now, I'd have rather drawn my own conclusions. A disappointing end to a previously fantastic trilogy. What a crying shame..<br/><br/>4/10"

","MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS!<br/><br/>For years to come after the hype surrounding these movies has died down i think people will look at this trilogy and realise that it is good....but not great. From this movie i believe that what people will remember is the ending. Does it leave it open for a 4th instalment? that's for you to decide but the Ending itself is one of the worst i have seen in a film EVER and it ruins what was a very entertaining saga.<br/><br/>In short this is the worst of the three movies. That's not to say that it is bad but it is a very agverage film. It does have its moments. The attack on Zion is fantastic but it is the high point of what is an alright movie.<br/><br/>
Everything leading up to the attack is great. But the Wachowski brothers seemed to have forgotten what made the first film so great and, instead, turned a brilliantly original concept into your typical sci-fi adventure. This film is also far more cliche ridden than the other two, delving into mushy lovey-dubby territory when you least want it.<br/><br/>After the main attack on Zion the movie goes seriously downhill. The final showdown between Agent Smith and Neo is the least impressive fight scene in the whole trilogy, which is a huge anti-climax as it is what many people have been looking forward to. Trinty's death scene was so over the top that most of the cinema started laughing and who can blame them? This movie also proves that Mr Reeves cannot act to save himself. Just look at his pittiful attempt to be upset when the love of his life is lying there dying.<br/><br/>A major downside to this saga is that it leaves alot of questions still open. This can be good for people who want to make up their own minds but for a mainstream and mostly passive audience that this is made for it only acts as a anomoly. There are also many questions answered in Enter The Matrix and the Animatrix but for those who have never seen these it acts as another downside. Many people i know could not understand why they were looking for Niobe's ship at the beginning of this movie. Play the game and find out.<br/><br/>It is too long too dramatic and an almighty anti-climax to an otherwise great trilogy. But that said the first half is very entertaining and the battle for Zion is awesome. It does not, however, detract from the fact that the last half hour of this movie is overly long and drawn out.<br/><br/>3/5"
"Hagwag","Null","0","0","6 December 2003"," Misunderstood
","Okay, let's set a few things straight. This was not 'the third Matrix film', like Alien 3 was the third Alien film or Die Another Day was the 20th Bond film. This was the conclusion to a three-part story, not a cash-in. When the Wachowski brothers made the first film, they never intended for that to be it. 'The Matrix' was mere exposition - familiarising the audience with the rules of the universe we would revisit later. There was a story within the original film, yes, but it was not part of the story told in the trilogy as a whole. That was reserved for the second two films.<br/><br/>And what a story. The last human city on Earth is under siege; the planet has been taken over by a vast artificial intelligence. There are less than three days before humanity is destroyed forever, and homo sapiens is to be nothing more than a source of fuel. One man may or may not have the power to stop the machines, but not everyone believes in him. There's destiny, fate, love, war, politics, religion, philosophy. This is good sci-fi.<br/><br/>Why do people dislike films 2 and 3? Because it doesn't live up to their expectations of what 'a Matrix film' should be. If you're one of those people, then you need to wait till all three DVDs are out and sit down and watch them, one after the other, with the understanding that the second two films are not 'sequels', they are the meat of the trilogy. Trust me, it'll make a lot more sense, and your expectations will be vastly different.<br/><br/>And you do need to watch each film several times to fully grasp the underlying philosophy. I know that sounds pretentious, but it's true. Some fairly important aspects of the plot are buried just under the surface of what's immediately obvious.<br/><br/>So, Revolutions. Is it any good? Hell, yeah. It opens quite slowly - for a while, I thought 'oh, they've gone and c***ed it up'. But then again, I thought that half way through Reloaded. The film gripped me, tighter and tighter, and I didn't realise until I was gasping for breath. That was sometime during the battle in the dock. You see, this time, the battle is real. It ain't the Matrix. Those slugs and shells will hurt you, and you can see the fear and adrenaline on the faces of the volunteers, moments before they are annihilated by a swarm of squiddies. These people are fighting for their lives, and for the life of humanity itself. It's epic, and you've never seen a battle in which live action and CGI have been so successfully blended to create so much devastation.<br/><br/>There are a few scenes where, like in much of the rest of the trilogy, the violence is stylistic and gratuitous (not that there's anything wrong with that) and people don't get hurt (one scene in particular is reminiscent of the lobby scene in the original film). They're cool. I like watching them. But in Revolutions (unlike Reloaded, it could be said), there are also fights that have meaning. They have consequences. The climactic showdown between Neo and Smith is one such fight - everything is at stake.<br/><br/>The ending is ambiguous. I don't know how to feel about it. I don't mean that I don't know whether or not it was well executed, I mean that I don't know how I should feel on behalf of the characters that continue to live in that universe. It's unexpected. We are given plenty of surprises in this film, and without giving too much away, not everyone gets to go home for tea and medals. Conversely, there are some hugely uplifting moments - one of my favourites is the look on Trinity's face when she becomes the only living human to have seen the sun. There's something simultaneously beautiful and depressing about that.<br/><br/>Gawd, I've just rambled on for ever. No one will have read this far. But if you did, and you either didn't see this film because you didn't want to have the Matrix spoiled for you, or saw it and didn't enjoy it, then watch it (again). Just watch it on its own terms, not yours. This is important cinema.<br/><br/>PS watch it on IMAX!"

","I have seen this film three times. At first when I saw it, I was kinda of little disappointed but little shocked at the same time. The most bizzare thing that happened to me is... that this film ended up the same way as I expected it to happen. So I went to see it again on the same day when it opened... I came out and had a big thought about how well The Wachowski Brothers did to Matrix Trilogy. Matrix Revolutions was a good conclusion because I don't like to expect most films to have a ""happy ending"", just for a difference. I believed that ending can happen. So I really can't judge on all 3 to decide which one is better. I liked them all. But I'm more entertained to The Matrix Reloaded than this one. That 17 minute battle sequence was well done, it seemed like they're trying to make it bigger than a 15 minute freeway chase sequence in Reloaded. But I still go for Reloaded. Also... Reloaded and Revolutions may lack it's plot but both still were good. A NICE JOB TO END THIS TRILOGY. I want to give this message to critics... you seemed like you don't understand movies that well. You all killed this movie, that's why it's not doing well. Why would you expect to kill this movie, because of lacking in story and stupid dialogue along with disappointed ending??? You're wrong. I didn't care much for dialogue because I want Wachowski Brothers to end the trilogy in a new way than other trilogy films. That's why I'm saying it's a good conclusion to trilogy and ignore those critics, they are not always believable, they just put down words as what they wanted to say about this film. I'm watching out for Lord of the Rings 3 and see how it ends. Lord of the Rings 1 was boring, and 2nd one is pretty entertaining so my hands are crossed for 3rd one."

"bix171","6","0","0","3 December 2003"," The Best Because It's The Simplest
","Probably the best of the trilogy for the simple reason that it's the easiest to follow: the Wachowski Brothers finally dispense with the philosophical claptrap that marred the first two pictures and rush-deliver a dumbed-down conclusion (love conquers all, believe it or not) in order to focus on two epic battles: one between humans and machines (a battle for the underground human city of Zion) and one between a human and computer program (Keanu Reeves' Neo and Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith). Or something like that. The two battles comprise essentially that last two-thirds of the movie, which means that it's perfectly all right to sit back and not have to think, and the relief, you realize, allows you to enjoy it as a movie-movie. The special effects, while far from innovative (there seems to be a lot of cribbing from James Cameron's `Aliens' and `Terminator 2: Judgment Day'), are diverting enough and the monumental martial arts fight between Reeves and Weaving is so long that you start to feel kind of giddy midway. These are emotions not often realized in the first two films; though there was plenty of awe at the effects, design and, initially, the concept, there never has been much joy in watching them. Here, while you realize that, overall, you're not watching anything particularly joyous, at least you're reasonably entertained. (Note: like its predecessor, this film was viewed in the IMAX format, which is proving to make a difference in fantasy and animation presentations; the clarity and depth of color is helping make this the preferred choice for these genres.

","*Spoilers alert*<br/><br/>If people went to see THE MATRIX RELOADED because it was a sequel to the much loved, original and audacious THE MATRIX, I believe people went to see THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS because they wanted answers, mainly. It's not that people weren't expecting also a lot of action, special effects and thrills in this final settlement of the Wachowskis' tale of an apocalyptic world controlled by the machines, but I do believe people were expecting, above all, answers, many answers.<br/><br/>The Matrix franchise became a cult, with a lot of web-talk. User thesis and explanations about virtually everything covered in both movies crawled from all over the places. It's not easy to please everybody, if not impossible at all, and The Wachowski Brothers surely were aware no matter the end they would chose for the trilogy they would deceive some serious fans. Instead of delivering answers, REVOLUTIONS starts with more questions. Where is Neo? What have happened to him? What is Mobil Ave? And so onÂ…<br/><br/>In an intelligent move, The Wachowski Brothers manage to avoid delivering critical answers for almost two hours. As an alternative, they present a movie loaded with action and over-the-top special effects. The Zion attack scene, which lasts 14 minutes, is a gripping combination of military action, general mayhem and digital effects. It's flawless and it totally absorbed me. In fact, it's so effective that you almost forget you wanted answers when you entered the movie theatre. More action sequences follow: there's Neo and Trinity over the crop fields; the final fight with Agent Smith; amongst others. Overall, REVOLUTIONS is a great action movie, more efficient than RELOADED.<br/><br/>But let's not forget we wanted answers. And that's the big problem of this movie. REVOLUTIONS is betrayed by an anti-climax of such proportions only equaled by the one of Monty Python's HOLY GRAIL. There are no answers, or at least, not as many as we expected after watching the three movies. During the whole film, I expected a mind-blowing speech like the one The Arquitect delivered in RELOADED, but there is no speech at all, and when The Arquitect comes in, you know everything that had to be explained already was. I hate movies where one character, by the end, explains what is already pretty obvious to us. But in the universes created by THE MATRIX nothing is obvious enough and I'm strongly convicted that a final speech, even if it were a rhetorical one, would give a lot of strength and cohesion to this film, as well as to the whole trilogy.<br/><br/>That's not to say nothing makes sense or that we are left in oblivion. Although a lot of questions will remain unanswered, REVOLUTIONS presents a few facts. Everything else is interpretative. Therefore, multiple theories about The Matrix, The One, the war, the Agents may still be valid, as is the possibility of a fourth episode.<br/><br/>Considering the dreadful possible exits to REVOLUTIONS, like the so much debated Matrix-within-Matrix theory, I must confess I found the peace-agreement solution extremely honest and even original. It's nice to see The Wachowski Brothers didn't go for a manichaean settlement like it was expected."

","First of all, let me say that the action scenes and special effects were awesome, no questions about that, but the story and characters, oh man, what a dissapointment. Ending left me with so many questions, and none of the main characters really mattered anymore. Neo and Trinity are absent for most of the movie, which is simply stupid. I dont think i really cared if main characters lived or died, because nothing envolved around them. Im still going to recommend this movie for its entertaining value, but if you are looking for answers and conclusions from the first two movies, you've come to the wrong place.

","I was rather looking forward to this film but I was majorly disappointed. The Matrix was fantastic, The Matrix Reloaded was slightly disappointing but had its high points, and The Matrix Revolutions was awful, literally, awful. This film was terrible from almost every aspect - there were few fight scenes and those that were supposed to be 'big' were easily forgettable. E.g. the fight in the rain - anticipated but boring. There were 3 people in the theatre for a 6.40 screening. Everyone was asleep or talking about something other than the matrix. What a waste of time and money. Bring on Return of the King. Revolutions can go to movie hell. 0 out 10."

","Okay... so the first Matrix was awesome.  The special effects were ground-breaking, and the plot wasn't half-bad either.  Then, the second film came along.  Reloaded formed a bridge from the effects-based original into the philosophical world of the Matrix.  Thus, the Wachowski brothers brought us further glimpses of the plot of the Matrix:  Machines vs. Men, computer programs personified, the overwhelming theme of Choice.  Then, they brought us Revolutions.  By this point, the effects, though still pretty awesome, had lost that new car smell, and we began to see a bit of redundancy.  The brothers carried over the same theme of Choice into this film as well, but they made one major mistake, in my eyes.  While they should have been capping off this spectacular trilogy they placed over it, a blanket of Christianity.  The Matrix, in its whole, as a trilogy, is an obvious parallel to the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, and the Passion.  As if the imagery wasn't obvious enough, they gave us Zion, Trinity, and the Nebuchadnezzar, all biblical or Christian references.  Then, there were the multiple crucifixions and resurrections.  For example, when Neo goes to the robot city, and they plug him in, with his arms out at ninety degree angles, as if he was on a large cross.  And the light goes through him, and blatantly forms a cross at his abdomen region.  And finally, the last scene of Revolutions, where Sati creates the magnificent sunrise, and she tells the Oracle that she did it for Neo.  I thought for a good amount of time, after the first and second films were released, that someone had actually succeeded in producing a purely awesome sci-fi movie with excellent philosophical themes.  But after seeing Revolutions, I realized that the Wachowski brothers could not resist turning their masterpiece into a piece of Christian propaganda."

","I have heard a great deal of talk from Matrix purists (akin to Star Wars nuts) who have made the point that the first movie was amazing and the Wachowski's should have left it at that.  Perhaps they are right I'm not yet decided.<br/><br/>Despite this I enjoyed Matrix Reloaded, even if only for entertainment value alone. However, Matrix Revolutions is the biggest bomb this year.  I know that one should not expect too much from a sci-fi trilogy that was only ever intended as a stand alone movie, but having said this all the hard work that went into creating these characters, this world, this movie, is completely undone by the crap served up in Revolutions.<br/><br/>Acting is not Keanu or Carrie-Ann's strong suit but they do have good on-screen chemistry.  Neo and Morpheus' relationship is strong and a feature of particularly the first movie and to a lesser degree the second.  Where were these characters?  Who gives a toss about Link and Zee or Captain Tanaka and that stupid kid?  It is possible I might have, had the acting been stronger and the dialogue better i.e Kid: ""I've never completed the training program."" Tanaka: ""Neither have I.""<br/><br/>It's lines like this that made me physically sick and despite the special effects fest the whole movie was very pedestrian.  It had completed departed from the philosophy of the first movie and just seemed like a gratuitous use of special effects which encased a very hollow movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps if I had've had a couple of joints this might have been funny like ""Halfbaked"" or ""Scary Movie"" but as a conclusion to what could've taken over from Star Wars as one of the best Sci-Fi sagas of all time, I think not.<br/><br/>4 out of 10."

","The trailer for the Return of the King was shown prior to my viewing of Revolutions and all during the movie i kept thinking about Frodo and Aragorn and knowing it would far surpass the conclusion to the Matrix Trilogy.  It was hard not to think of middle earth during the final installment of the matrix.  Amidst the confusing twists and turns the story in revolutions was taking i had to find a happy place in my head and that was to enter the matrix of Gondor and Mordor.<br/><br/>I refused to see the original matrix for almost two years because of Keanu Reeves until at last someone gave me a copy of the movie and i decided i had better see what all the fuss was about.  I watched it four times in a row that saturday.  It was pure genious.  I didn't mind reloaded at all but for the 20 minute orgy in zion.  I thought for a minute there that clips of The real Cancun was being spliced into the film.  From that scene i couldn't believe there was anyone older than thirty in zion.<br/><br/>So Revolutions came with a lot of hype and i generally liked the film for its wonderful images and thousands of sentinels pouring into the last human settlement.  I thought the fights were still stellar with all the same quality as the first two films.  It was great how Smith infiltrated the real world.  But the ending was as disturbing as the remake of The Island of Dr. Moreau with Val Kilmer.<br/><br/>Nothing was resolved!  So Neo brings peace, for how long?  Are all humans released from their comatose baths in that pink jelly?  Is zion rebuilt and humans learn to be sewer dwellers like in CHUD?  What is really won by all of this?  Do the Architect and the Oracle find time to be alone together? It just makes no sense except for the producers to count ticket sales and to announce, ""Yes!  We have enough to do a fourth installment!""  That's the real wool over our eyes.  If the matrix is at all real in our world... it's name is Hollywood and the machines are the producers and movie makers that force us to be plugged into their creations to give them life.<br/><br/>
Funny, i almost fell for the advertisement before return of the king that plead with the audience to end movie piracy.  That's just part of the revolution, i suppose.  I think the vision of the Matrix was unlike anything else, but perhaps they should have taken an extra 15 minutes to give better closure to the climactic events that were revealed in this film.  I couldn't give a better review, but maybe the two seven year olds sitting behind me in the theater will leave their comments."

As I have read articles and reviews of this movie, I came to realize many people didn't understand the ending, or thought the ending was lame. I, on the other hand, think the movie and trilogy couldn't have ended in any other way. And I also strongly disagree that Neo will return. Even though the Oracle speaks of a possible return, I don't think we will get any other sequels to The Matrix. At least I hope not, since so many other great movies have been totally ruined by making bad sequels.<br/><br/>In other words I think this movie lived up to the expectations and feelings of true Matrix-fans.

","*Possible Spoilers* The first 'Matrix' was a masterpiece, a superb action movie that was thoroughly enjoyable. 'The Matrix Reloaded' was OK, but not to the high standards of the first film. Mainly because of the hype surrounding the third and final instalment of the series, 'The Matrix Revolutions' I had high hopes for the movie, and believed that it would be far better than the previous film. Much to my disappointment, it wasn't. The main battle sequence to save Zion had breathtaking special effects, no one can doubt that but it did get a bit repetitive after a period of constant shooting. The end battle between Smith and Neo also contained some excellent visual effects, but I found it to be very long and dragged out. Thus, it again started to feel boring. This then had a knock-on effect on the whole film, making it feel to lengthy in general. In my opinion, 'The Matrix' should have been left at the first film, and not continued any further, because in the end it just became too complicated for the vast majority of the audience to understand all of the deep plot. The complicated story draws the viewers away from feeling 'connected' with the film, meaning they don't enjoy it as much. This film is very disappointing, and does not live up to the hype surrounding it. Without the cushion of the first two films behind it really is less than average. Summary: Don't believe the hype. The best bit is the fact that it provides an end of the story for the die-hard 'Matrix' fans, but other than that, its not great. The original 'Matrix' is a far better movie (so is 'Reloaded'), but better still is 'Equilibrium', so go and watch them instead. My rating: 4/10."

""The Matrix Revolutions"" (the third and ""final"" installment in ""The Matrix"" trilogy) is not exactly the ""best"" in the trilogy, yet how can one consider these films to be totally independent from one another?  It is true, the original was not made with the sequels on the drawing board, yet the sequels themselves were within the minds of the directors (Andy and Larry Wachowski) when confronted with the aspect of  ""franchise.""  So, with that said, this film cannot entirely be dispatched from either ""The Matrix"" or, especially, the open-ended ""The Matrix Reloaded.""<br/><br/>What is the best then--if it has already been established that these three films are the cinematic equivolant to a ""special-issue"" comic-book series? The scale of ""Revolutions"" has been correctly linked with that of ""Lord of The Rings""--but what of its density?  The film is more an affirmation of what has been long expected since Neo's (Keanu Reeves) first flight at the end of ""The Matrix""--huge scale action, and one of the best displays (definitely the most elaborate) of a battle royal between two opposing forces of ""equal"" yet ""opposite"" strengths.  It was like Superman verses Bazarro....<br/><br/>We start off learning that Neo is dangling in a type of Limbo--a train station between the ""real"" world and the Matrix.  The Oracle (Mary Alice) has been transformed physically (she had been originally played by the late Gloria Foster)  into a new woman--yet the same flair and usage of elusive reasoning is there.  In fact, rev is just an extension of what had been already established in the first film:  Neo is the One and is superhuman, capable of crippling the omnipotent Matrix: a labyrinth designed to control the minds of its prey with mimetic imagery of what was once real to man--in the first film it was the late 20th century, in this film, apparently, the 21st century.<br/><br/>The ""real"" world encompasses Zion, the last ""free"" human city.  The ""systemic anomaly"" Neo eventually comes out of his comatose in ""Revolutions"" to realize that his arch nemeses Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) possesses the body of Bane (Ian Bliss) within the real world--a possession commenced in ""Reloaded.""  Agent Smith, of course, is the systemic anti-anomaly that swirled up out of the Matrix from being an Agent (program designed to keep the stability in the Matrix) into, as stated earlier, Bazarro.  Yet, how is Smith in the real world?<br/><br/>Many questions that arose in ""Reloaded"" are still there during ""Revolutions'"" end credits.  It seems as though ""Revolutions"" was just a big question that has subsequent answers imbedded in it--one just needs to think about them.<br/><br/>There are large battle sequences between the machines (Sentinels) and Zion that are dazzling--yet certain aspects of its tribalism are obvious setbacks, all too obvious.<br/><br/>The main issue with ""Revolutions"" is that it doesn't provide answers to a society predominantly answer-hungry, myself included.  Yet it leaves so much up to the audience to answer--or to question.<br/><br/>The question posed earlier was: which is the best out of this trilogy? They are all good on one level or another, using one type of entertainment or another: There is always the verbal philosophy of the first film (something left unparalleled by the sequels); there is always the super-realistic action of ""Reloaded"" and its additional thematic elements (the freeway chase, the ""Burly Brawl,"" and The Architect's ramble); and, of course, there is ""Revolutions,"" which is predominantly concerned with saving Zion from the Sentinels, yet occasionally returns to the Matrix--the final fight between Neo and Agent Smith is the largest exception.  For the ""best,"" well, you won't find it here.  Either one must look at the trilogy selectively, take it as one whole chunk, or just discard it altogether, I guess.<br/><br/>The open-ended questions in this film are used in many franchise formulas--and usually spawn more sequels.  Yet, it has been stated, that both directors are exhausted from the workout this trilogy caused them, and may take a hiatus once it's said and done with.<br/><br/>So what then?<br/><br/>Will there be a sequel?  The ""happy ending"" in this film connotes a sense of sarcasm--an almost-vicious nihilism.  And there are always the questionable Architect and Oracle, whose intelligence is questionable.  In other words-maybe, or maybe not.<br/><br/>From a large chunk of fatty philosophy, to less-is-more philosophy (but big action is super cool), to even-less-is-more philosophy (and big comic book and Mech Warrior-like action is always super cool), to leaving questions tacked on other questions--the Matrix trilogy has seemingly spanned history. But it would've been nice to know a little more."

","THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS / Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski / Written by Andy and Larry Wachowski / Running Time: 129 minutes / Rated R / Capsule Review / Score: ***<br/><br/>
Everything that has a beginning has an end. 'The Matrix Revolutions' is a better film than 'The Matrix Reloaded' but the second installment was nowhere near the original Matrix, which gives you an idea where the third film stands in comparison. The trilogy is mostly about purpose. Neo (Keanu Reeves), in the beginning of the film stuck in 'limbo' between the real world and the Matrix, now knows his purpose: His road lies with Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), an increasingly powerful threat to both Zion and the Machines. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Niobe (Jada-Pinkett Smith) command ships through tunnels deep inside the earth. Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), curiously, doesn't seem to have much to do here, besides staring into Keanu's eyes. 'The Matrix Revolutions' is beautiful spectacle, and the attack for Zion has some of the best computer effects I have ever seen. Action is plentiful, but shouldn't there be more of a closing, more of a wrap-up between man and machine, a struggle conflicting for two centuries? 'Reloaded' was disliked primarily for it's unnatural beginning and ending, with characters speaking in psychobabble along the whole, rickety way. It asked many questions. 'Matrix Revolutions' seems to have forgotten those questions and never answers them. The film ends as if the Brothers were in talk of a fourth movie. Some questions are answered, but the questions end up being more compelling than the answers. Thankfully, there is some kind of revolution, but only diehard fans will find complete satisfaction. Others are better off with a different movie."
"brotherbabyface","Null","0","0","25 November 2003"," Did anyone notice this movie didn't really end anything?
","Basically, the main problem I had with this movie was that it promised ""Everything that has a beginning has an end"".  That is simply not the case. Things are right back where they were at the beginning of the first movie!! The machines still have the vast majority of humans hooked up to their power plants, or whatever, they still have all their armies, squiddies, and other robots, and basically still control the world!  The humans are still living in squallor under the earth with most of their race enslaved.  The Matrix is still around, although it is unclear if all the inhabitants have been...uhm...Smith-ified.  So were all the humans that were plugged in destroyed when Smith posessed them and was destroyed?  Is the Matrix now the province of the programs alone?  Is Neo dead?  Are the machines going to taxi him home?  Nothing is clear.  It's just a train-wreck of an ending to a once promising series.  After three movies, the humans haven't made one step forward in the war, and no one seems to notice!  Neo didn't defeat the machines, he just stalled them and since the original goal was to free the human race, he's really accomplished nothing.  In the end...If you think about it...Neo saved the Matrix from Smith!  That's it!!  The One saved the Matrix.  Ironic, really.  And now he's in a coma, Trinity's dead, and he hasn't done doo-doo.  So what was the point to this whole affair? Frankly, I think he was better off processing data as Mr. Anderson.<br/><br/>This chapter in a steadily waning saga was little more than a mish-mash of two lame fights, (easily trumped in the first movie by the newness of everything, and the second by the amazing fight with the vampires, the Twins, and the highway chase) several new and poorly developed characters (train-guy anyone?) and some of the worst war movie cliches ever seen in modern film (the plucky kid saves the day, the hardened veteran has a soft spot for the kid, and of course they collaborate to open the door for the heroes, with the help of the pilot's girlfriend in a near-exact recreation of Han clearing the way for Luke at the first Death Star).  There were even some outright mistakes.  The whole opening of the movie was a mistake and a waste of time.  How did Neo get out?  They unplugged him when he woke up, but he was never plugged in in the first place!?!  The machines can make a billion of the squiddies, but only two of the drill robots? Riiiiight. Overall, it was meandering, dull, and contrived. Enough is enough.  This trilogy started out with a nuclear blast, went down to a bottle rocket, and ended with a minor gaseous disturbance in your father's Laz-E-Boy.  As a fan, I'm pretty let-down."

Not to say there isn't a 60-year old woman out there who won't be giddy with excitement seeing Neo and Agent Smith throw down in a superpowered, rain-soaked, zero-gravity battle royale, but I think its safe to say that the target audience for this sort of thing drops exponentially for every ten years removed from age 25.<br/><br/>3) You think kung-fu comic book action movies ought to feature Sir Lawrence Olivier in the lead, reading lines straight from the pen of Shakespeare himself. It doesn't and it shouldn't.<br/><br/>If all you're after, though, is one last mind-blowing trip into the incredible visual of world of the brothers Wachowski, strap yourself in and enjoy the ride. You won't be sorry.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS BELOW*<br/><br/>First off, it helps to understand that Reloaded and Revolutions are two parts of the same film, rather than two truly separate sequels. Ironically, I think that the Wachowski Bros. intended the apparently highly unpopular Reloaded to be the big, bustling crowd-pleaser (and so it was, as far as I'm concerned)so when Revolutions hit, people wouldn't be so put off by the rather downbeat conclusion. Oops. Oh well.<br/><br/>It has been noted by critics and several posters that Matrix fans too often retort that those who pan the films simply ""don't get it."" While I agree that this can't be used as a catch-all for a film's shortcomings, some of the most frequent criticisms in terms of the plot of ""Revolutions"" tell me that many critics either weren't paying very close attention or that there is indeed some merit to the ""don't get it"" accusation. For instance, over and over people ask ""What happened to all the people still in the Matrix? Why didn't Neo and Co. rescue them?"" Well, if you were listening during the first and second films, you'd know that 1) generally only the very young can be freed from the matrix (Morpheus: ""We have a rule. We never free a mind once it has reached a certain age. It's dangerous. The mind has trouble letting go.""), and 2)that the intervening time between the first film and the second was largely spent freeing plug-ins (Morpheus: ""We have freed more minds in the past six months than in the past six years.""). The problem that faces Neo and Co. is that to destroy the Matrix entirely would result in a full system crash, killing of all those millions of people still ""plugged in,"" as is directly noted by the Architect at the end of Reloaded. Thus in Revolutions, contrary to what has been concluded by many reviewers, Neo does indeed save those ""plugged in"" by ridding the system of the virus Smith that, left unchecked, would have crashed the system.<br/><br/>Another plot point frequently brought up is, ""Why doesn't Zion have more EMP's and/or why didn't they use them?"" Yet another point DIRECTLY ADDRESSED not only in the third film but in the first as well - an EMP doesn't just knock out the Sentinels, but all of Zion's electronic defense systems as well. As Lock points out, while the Hammer's deployment of an EMP temporarily saves the day, its use also leaves Zion completely defenseless against the next wave of attack. So why would Zion have a plethora of EMP's when using them would either mean destroying their own defense capabilities or shutting them down completely? This is the sort of sloppy criticism that elicits the ""you just don't get it"" reply from fans, and in some cases it is rightly deserved.<br/><br/>The real reason behind the decidedly negative response to Revolutions, I believe, is that the way it ends forces you to draw your own conclusions about a great many things and presents supreme triumph by either side as being impossible and ultimately contradictory. The series ends the only way it can, if you've been paying attention (again, seeing the Animatrix, particularly The Second Renaissance Parts I and II, will go a long way towards explaining the resolution), in a manner that is both, for me at least, totally satisfying while still leaving enough unsaid to keep your head spinning with images and possibilities for weeks to come.<br/><br/>
In short, Revolutions is one last terrific ride through The Matrix universe, with the final showdown between Neo and Smith worth the price of admission alone (contrary to many reviews - not sure which fight THEY were watching...). Get to the theater, see it, and as the Oracle might say, make up your own damn mind."

","**** MAJOR SPOILERS **** I have to say I was disappointed by The Matrix Revolutions. It was<br/><br/>certainly very entertaining, but a bit of a letdown after such an<br/><br/>excellent middle chapter and its reinvigoration of the stand-alone<br/><br/>first film's style and concepts (not everyone agrees, but I thought<br/><br/>Reloaded was one of the best sequels ever). I just thought it was a<br/><br/>shame it all came down to a rather too gooey love story, too basic<br/><br/>good vs evil (life and choice vs Smith's death and purpose  no<br/><br/>more convincing motivation than that) and the fact that Neo really<br/><br/>was the One. Boo! A logical and romantic, rather than mystical and<br/><br/>romantic, conclusion was what I was hoping for. Promising<br/><br/>characters such as the Merovingian and Persephone  and the<br/><br/>Twins  were given little  or no  follow-up; instead we had new<br/><br/>characters (the Trainman, Sati) to use up 'their' screen time (and<br/><br/>needlessly confuse matters). I particularly think that the whole,<br/><br/>mind-blowing Architect confrontation from Reloaded being totally<br/><br/>dismissed (quite literally, by the Oracle just saying, 'Oh, please!')<br/><br/>was such a shame  actually, it was a viewer-disrespecting bloody<br/><br/>great cheat! It had all seemed really promising when we came out<br/><br/>of Reloaded and excitedly talked through all our theories as to<br/><br/>meanings and possibilities... I'd hoped the twists would be<br/><br/>something as clever as a second layer to the Matrix (i.e. Zion),<br/><br/>Smith being a part of the machines' purpose, despite his own<br/><br/>desires and beliefs  as it had seemed Neo was  and/or Neo<br/><br/>being just an ordinary man (albeit a talented programmer) after all.<br/><br/>Instead, it all got heavily messianic (What? So he was Christ 'dying<br/><br/>on the cross' at the end, there?) and more than a bit too<br/><br/>melodramatic. The sense of the ridiculous in the first two films'<br/><br/>more dramatic sequences was just about kept balanced with<br/><br/>humour and knowing geekiness (and helped by the in-your-face<br/><br/>techno music that said: 'Whoah! Isn't this a cool film?!'), but here<br/><br/>we had only the odd glib line for comfort and too few really<br/><br/>meaningful exchanges (and a high-drama orchestral score that<br/><br/>said: 'Aww! Isn't this deep, heart-rending stuff?'). Anyway, a<br/><br/>perfectly fine, even thrilling action film  I especially liked the Bane<br/><br/>confrontation and, of course, the Zion battles  but not the end to<br/><br/>this brilliant trilogy that I would have written."
"chinko_ninja","Null","0","0","24 November 2003"," The Matrix Trilogy And You
","Finally, The Saga of Neo and the Last Humans has ended. I can't say that Matrix Revolutions was spectacular, it was... satisfactory to say the least.<br/><br/>
For those of you who's not in the know, or haven't seen any Matrix movie yet, here's the lowdown (WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS UP AHEAD):<br/><br/>The Matrix:<br/><br/>Thomas Anderson also known as the hacker Neo is an average joe employee of Metacortex, who was contacted by the enigmatic but wise Morpheus, making him choose between two colored pills. Neo chose the red pill and down the rabbit-hole he goes. He was told that he was living in a dream world all along. That the reality he knows is not actually real, but an illusion imposed upon them by the Machines. At first, as in all revelations, Neo couldn't accept the truth, much less accept the fact that he's The One. The messiah to save the last remaining humans from destruction. Until he found out that he knows Kung-Fu and can really kick some serious ass inside the Matrix. And when he jacks in the Matrix again he is reintroduced to one of the coolest villains to ever manifest on film - Agent Smith. Blending evil and sophistication, Agent Smith epitomizes the ultimate antagonist. Hannibal Lecter, Dracula and Michael Corleone all rolled into one. Phenomenal kung-fu fight scenes and wireworks ensue, ridiculous amounts of gun shells litter the streets, and Trinity in all her Latex-fetish glory. In the end, Neo defeated the Agents and Smith, thus scoring one for the team. The action sequences in this movie was really ground-breaking. Spawning the ever-famous and ever-present ""bullet-time"" event, photocopied by many action movies, but never surpassed. It's a fact, The Matrix raised the bar so high for action movies, I haven't seen any action movie lately without at least one scene with bullets ripping through the space-time continuum in slow-motion. Oh, and the flying-crane-kick-in-3D rendered by the lovely Trinity was also a keeper.<br/><br/>
The Matrix Reloaded:<br/><br/>Now, if you're a real detail freak, you have to at least see The Animatrix and played Enter The Matrix video game before seeing this one, because the sequence of events leading to Reloaded started in The Animatrix episode: ""The Final Flight of the Osiris"".  In a nutshell, Neo & the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar must find the Keymaker, who's being held captive by the uber-slick Merovingian and his wife Persephone (played by the goddess of desire Monica Bellucci!), and guarded by the Phantom Twins. As expected, Neo & the gang find the Keymaker and make a run for it. However, the movie wouldn't be complete without fantastic kung-fu brawls, samurai sword fights, and the most spectacular car chase ever caught on film. If you have a weak heart, you might want to close your eyes on the motorcycle escape scene, let me tell you, I'm still peeling my jaws off the floor because of that! The trucktop scuffle is not to be missed and of course the nick-of-time rescue by SuperNeo is heart-stopping. Special effects galore, ultracool fashion, and Monica Bellucci, what else could you possibly want? Although the long-winded and convoluted philosophical exchange between Neo and the Architect is the only drawback, which by the way didn't contribute anything to the story, nevertheless, Matrix Reloaded is one wrapped in grandeur, delivered in style, and presented in superlative coolness.<br/><br/>
The Matrix Revolutions:<br/><br/>This concludes the Matrix Trilogy. It doesn't go any further than this one. This is it. The do-or-die ending of the series. Picking up the story moments after Reloaded, you'll see Neo physically in a comatose state but his conciousness trapped in Purgatory, the world between the Matrix and the Real World. Trinity & Morpheus consult the Oracle and find out that the Merovingian is the one responsible for Neo's predicament, resulting in a magnificent Club Hell melee. Several gunfights, scorpion-kicks, and a Monica Bellucci (sporting the world's most tortured cleavage) later the Merovingian conceded and told them how to rescue Neo in the world's cleanest train station ever. If there is one drawback from Reloaded, Revolutions has a trainload of it. From the quasi-philosophical ramblings of the Hindu software exile, to the Merovingian's S & M-induced nonsensical discourse, you have to stretch your patience a little farther to keep yourself from yawning. But don't lose heart, after all that jazz you'll be rewarded with the Siege of Zion.<br/><br/>The machines finally penetrated the underground human city of Zion and the humans, led by the pompous Commander Lock, has to make a daring last stand to avoid extinction. This scene is really impressive. Anime-inspired, adrenaline-energized, and loaded with so much firepower it's obscene. And lastly, the mother of all climactic fight scenes. Neo versus the super-enhanced and insanely-replicated Agent Smith. This brawl has everything but the kitchen sink. Bruce Lee, Mike Tyson, Superman, the X-Men, and the Hulk ain't got nothing on this one. This knock-down-and-drag-out tango will determine the fate of everything, especially the fate of the movie itself. I guess since this is the last part of the trilogy, WB pulled all the stops and threw in every penny they have to make this one special. In a way, it was a compelling watch but not sensational. It took me a while to make it all sink in, but after discussing it with some friends, Revolutions is not so bad. No, not bad at all. Just don't expect to see more jaw-dropping action scenes in this installment, after all, it's just the conclusion. It's thrilling but not striking, heavy but not dramatic, and amazing but not superb.<br/><br/>All in all, I love the Matrix Trilogy. It gave everything and nothing. But the legacy of the Matrix is what makes it outstanding. The concept of the Matrix made the viewers think, think about the reality of everything we hold dear, and everything we fear. I read from somewhere that the Wachowski Brothers (the writers and directors of the film) subtly injected some Judeo-Christian ideologies and Zen philosophies in the story. Some even said that Neo was really Jesus The Messiah, Morpheus was really John The Baptist, and Trinity was really Mary Magdalene. I don't know about that one. But for me, whatever message the makers of the film wants us to believe, I believe that in this world, I make my own Matrix. I fight my own battles. I fire my own guns. And I pilot my own ship. Of course, with much needed love and support from my wife and some guidance from the Divine Providence to help me light the dark corridors of my own wicked fantasies.<br/><br/>So for those of you who haven't seen The Matrix Trilogy yet, I suggest you go see it now before Neo loses the battle and we'll forever be slaves to the Matrix.<br/><br/>A reminder before you Log On, I can only show you the door, you're the one who has to enter. Because unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is.<br/><br/>Peace."

","The first Matrix movie was the true revolution. It had daring concept, beautiful special effects, and interesting dialog. This final (thank god) episode is such an anticlimax. For the producers, writers, and directors of this movie, the imagination certainly does not grow with the money.<br/><br/>
In this movie, the concept is falling apart to a state of inconsistency. It looks like a third rate military sci-fi action. It almost makes as much sense as the starship troopers.  the special effects are getting old. they are busy and noisy but not exciting. the dialogs are so dull.<br/><br/>
While watching it, I cannot deny that there were some interesting moments, but I was disappointed most of the time. I had hoped this trilogy could become a master piece.

","What a letdown.  When I first heard about the Matrix 2 and 3 I was appropriately excited and even after the second movie I was still looking forward to part 3 (albeit less then before).  But after seeing Revolutions, I (like many other posters) am glad the series is over.  I knew when I was watching it I didn't like it as much and though it kept my interest in the action scenes, the rest of the movie was nothing special.  I think there are several reasons why this movie was worse then the others and this is what I came up with...<br/><br/>1)Boring characters: In the original Matrix, Neo was a much more interesting character.  He was the everyman who was put in an extraordinary situation and had to learn to cope with the fact that he may be humanities only hope in a world he knows nothing about.  By the second one and definetly in the third one he is just a boring monotone character who says stuff like ""It ends tonight"" and ""I know what I must do"".  Pretty much lines that explain the action and do little to flesh out the character (a sign of poor writing).  He isn't a charismatic hero nor is he really awe-inspiring (as he is to the other characters).  Trinity and all of the other humans are just as lifeless.  I didn't really care about them or their fate and the interesting characters from Reloaded like the Merovingian and Persephone make a meaningless appearance.<br/><br/>2)Pointless scenes: The whole train station scene is entirely unnecesary and the characters in it.  The Indian couple and their girl and the Train master (or whatever he's called) add nothing to the plot and force the audience to listen to this bs diatribe about karma (which I guess is proven by this movie because while we got the good in part 1, we get the bad now in part 3).  They also could have left the S&M club scene out as well, and the only reason the characters went there was to get Neo out of the stupid train station (which was pointless itself).  The plot itself was extremely linear and the characters moved from point a to b to c (and all the while explaining their movements ""We have to get back to Zion"" ""I must go to the surface"", this crap would have been okay if there was some flavor to their dialogue but it was all stuff like that).<br/><br/>3)That's how it ends?: Ok so let me get this straight.  Neo sacrifices himself a la' christ to save his people and destroy smith, therefore ensuring the machines wont kill the remainder of humanity.  The problem I have with this is that the machines don't kill the people.  It seems inconsistent with their character to just stop because they ""made a deal with neo"".  They are MACHINES!  They have no sense of loyalty or honor. The machines came out on top if you think about it.  Neo and Smith are dead and the city is left defenseless, so why shouldn't the machines whipe out the people?  The humans could only mean trouble for them in the future so why leave them?  My answer is the studio answer.  They left them alive so if they wanted to make a 4th movie they could still have both the machines and the people alive and bring neo back with some sort of resurrection (if he is dead, which i am assuming).  This ending also reinforces the belief that they were just trying to end the whole the movie and didn't really think about being consistent with the prior motivations of the machines.<br/><br/>4)Focus away from the Matrix itself:  This is something else I noticed and I think contribued greatly to my lukewarm reception of the third one.  The most interesting part of the matrix movies to me (and I suspect many others) was the whole digital world of the matrix itself, where the laws of nature can be bent etc.  Even the second one had some cool stuff in the Matrix like the freeway chase (the twins were cool) and the Merovingian but in this one the Matrix is in the background.  What's in the foreground is the boring ""real world"" with it's flat characters and more familar post-apocalyptic setting.  The only reason they go in the Matrix this time is the train station scene (which in my opinion unnecesarilly complicates rather then enriches the matrix universe) and the fight scenes between Neo and Smith (which we have seen before in both movies).<br/><br/>5)Action masquerading as philosophy:  I think of this movie a lot like I think of Fight Club in the respect that it is primarily an action movie (and that is the main selling point of it) but it has some ""deep"" questions thrown in.  So while that it may have more depth then your average Vin Diesel action flick, in the end it's about as deep as Star Wars.  What people most enjoy about the Matrix is the action and all of the ""big ideas"" thrown in there are sometimes intriuging but mainly serve as a back drop for the movie and are often muddled together.  I think it's just a ridiculous defense for people to claim that the only reason someone didn't like the Matrix Revolutions or Fight Club or one of these other modern ""thinking-man's"" action movies is because they are too stupid to get it. I hesitate to even use this example because it may make me look pretentious but just compare this film to a Bergman movie like Persona or the Seventh Seal or any movie for that matter that seriously asks philosophical questions.  Those films are far more interesting on that level and make the matrix look juvenille by comparisson.  Now I like action movies as much as the next guy, in fact Hard-Boiled (which is all guns and no brains) is one of my all time favorites.  But I don't like it when people hold up movies like The Matrix Revolutions as examples of philosophical cinema, and chastise the people who don't like it as being stupid or ""unable to grasp the concepts"".<br/><br/>6)The little things: In most movies there are these little things that you either forgive and dismiss (because you are having a good time) or bug you, when you aren't.  I listed a few above (the train station, pointless characters etc.) and now I'll list a few more just for fun.  I found it ridiculous and perhaps inconsistent with the second movie (haven't checked this, nor do I really care to) that Zion had no ""EMT devices"" or whatever they are called.  I was led to believe by the second movie that there would be at least some ships hanging around the city and that only a few went out to look for Morpheus and the gang.  Anyway my grievance is that if they can make these EMT things and put them on all their ships why cant they have like 1 or 2 back at the base and just use it when all the Squid Machines come pouring in.  Yeah it knocked out their defenses, but they could just use it again when the second round of machines came in.  Besides their defenses sucked in the big picture and if the machines just ran right at all the mech guys with the guns right away instead of flying around in patterns and getting shot at the battle would have been much quicker.  I guess though that I'm glad they didn't use common sense cause that would have eliminated the movies best scene, but still it kind of bugs me in retrospect. Another thing was the music.  I read this comment from someone else (forget who, but good idea) and it seems to make sense to me.  The music in the first 2 (especially in the 2nd) was this cool kind of techno stuff that worked really well within the world of the matrix and the action scenes in general. In this one we had this more orchestral sound and in my opinion it wasnt consistent and didnt feel as right in a Matrix movie.  Now i recognize that this is really minor but I think it subtley attributed to taking away the ""cool factor"" that the other two films had and I think that the techno stuff is really well suited for the Matrix.<br/><br/>Anyway that's pretty much it.  And while this review sounds and is highly critical, it is so only because the previous two especially the first left me with high expectations and were really good (the first excellent) sci-fi action films.  Having seen lots of these types of movies I also conceed that the special effects were top notch and the action scenes were still pretty cool.  I'm giving it a 6/10 and it is definety worth the price of admission for fans of the genre but I don't think it is a ""must see"" for casual fans to which the films weaknesses may be more apparent.<br/><br/>

","Although the Wachowskis (probably misspelled) managed to somehow captivate people with loose plot, horrible acting, and laughable philosophy, I was not not at all impressed.  In fact I had thought that the Second Matrix was so bad that I wasn't planning on seeing this one.  One friend, who shall remain anonymous (Mike), dragged me to the slaughterhouse on this one.  The movie started with Neo trapped in some illogical place between the computer matrix and his own subconscious which seemed to me illogical and inconsistent with the rest of the Matrix movies.  In the Matrix, there was clear cut reality between a fabricated computer world and real existence.  In Revolutions, the Wachowskis tried to blur the lines for some mind bending purpose at which they ultimately failed miserably.  Besides the omnipresent incongruities and inconsistency, there was also the philosophical bull to deal with.  I tried to follow it but quickly became irritated with their ""I know that you know that I know that you know"" style of logic.  Those unexposed to any manner of critical thinking were obviously dazzled and astounding by so many big words said so fast (dont even try to tell me that it was over my head.)  Those who actually listened to the ridiculous dialogue and tried to break it down found it to be nothing more than muddy philosophical trash.  Another disgusting aspect of this movie was the plot.  The whole movie was a long drawn out battle scene between humans and machines in Zion.  So what?  The squids that pile in by the thousands are interesting for about 30 seconds before they become overkill and boring.  Meanwhile, Neo is fighting Agent Smith for supremacy of the Matrix that they ultimately want to destroy, right?  In another boring overkill scene, they fly around and battle with no apparent end or victor in sight.  Neo who emerged as a godlike figure in the first movie, can now barely stand up to many aspects of the Matrix which just makes him a boring b-grade character. On top of this add bits and chewy chunks of corny rubbish (the kid in the robot suit, Trinity's death) and the movie has become something to scoff and roll your eyes at every few minutes. Trinity's death in particular is so cliche and and Keanu Reeves'acting is so poor that I was restraining laughter the whole scene.  The topper for this horrible movie was the ending.  It provided no resolution and made room for an (ack) 4th movie.  Thank goodness those honorable machines hell bent on the eradication of humanity have so much integrity as to suddenly cease their attack against Zion...  This movies was so anticlimatic and terrible on so many levels that I would rate it a 1 on a 1-10 scale.  (the one is for the mild amusement of the special effects)"

The acting is as you would expect from this cast, good, but at times tending to be a little wooden. The story line is weak, and while it does follow on from the second film (Reloaded) better than that did from the original, it still feels highly disjointed.  Again, like the second film, it feels very padded-out in places, almost as if they knew the basic plot was not going to be sufficient to make a complete film, and relied on the special effects to make the film worthwhile.<br/><br/>The ending was left vague and inconclusive leaving the possibility of turning The Matrix into a quadrilogy or even creating a second Matrix trilogy.

It seems as if two different writers wrote the script for Smith and the script for the other actors. Maybe it's because of this that most of the newer actors (Matrix Reloaded and later) seem to just blur together indistinctly. <br/><br/>I suspect that the interesting philosophical and existential musings throughout the film originated with the Matrix comic book series. I somehow don't believe the Wachowski brothers could have come up with these philosophical ponderings. I enjoyed them more than any other dialogue in the film. The observations of some of the other characters struggling so hard to sound wise come off as frivolous. The fact that they speak their lines with such a serious face nearly made me double over from laughter. Let's put it this way, these guys are pure cheese, whereas dialogues engaged with questions of existence, its purpose, and human nature are much more thought-provoking. I found this film to be nearly as uneven as Artificial Intelligence, though the unveven-ness is less readily discernible."

","Having seen the first two movies and enjoyed them, I was looking forward to seeing Revolutions until I read and heard all of the negative reviews. As such, my expectations were low when I finally got a chance to see it this week.  Perhaps its because I saw it on an IMAX screen where the visual and audio quality were nothing short of outstanding.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and found it far more fluid and less ponderous than Reloaded.  I have no idea why this movie is getting such a bad rap.  See it on a big screen (find an IMAX theater new you) and enjoy it for what it is."

Revolutions is better than Reloaded. For one thing, the acting is significantly less wooden, though Trinity still is playing it too unemotionally (as is Neo).  The movie is far from perfect compared to the brilliant first outing and the plot lapses/confusions constantly annoy (try figuring out the Oracle's story).  Nothing compares to the car chase scene in Reloaded.  That said, all the animation/CGI constantly amazes.  The weak ending will leave you mad, literally."

","The Matrix Revolutions----4/10<br/><br/>When the credits rolled at the end of the Matrix Revolutions I was in an absolute state of shock and confusion. I sat trying to comprehend what I had just seen. After the incredible first part and the so-so second part of the trilogy my expectations had reached a new low. I expected so little from this film that I thought there was no way it could not meet these exceedingly low expectations. I was very, very wrong. Revolutions has become the new bar by which I will now measure cinematic disappointment.<br/><br/>This film is an absolute train wreck. The plot is ultimately where the movie fell apart. It has been marginalized in favor of titanic battles and large explosions. The little plot that remains is too nonsensical and fragmented to make any sense at all. Without a strong plot to back up the film it quickly degenerates into a generic Hollywood action film ,complete with bad acting and even worse dialog.<br/><br/>The thing that keeps this movie from plunging into the abyss of total, abject failure is the FX work. It is absolutely fantastic. If special effects are your thing, then you may want to see this film.

","The Matrix Revolutions (2003) Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss Directed by The Wachowski Brothers 150 min (?) Grade F (Rotten) (89)<br/><br/>**********WARNING**********<br/><br/>What follows are my views on the Matrix: Revolutions, nothing more, nothing less. They are not, in anyway, designed to offend, insult, or bash the fan base of the movie, and/or its predecessors.  With that being said, it should be readily obvious from the grade I gave the film above that I was not deeply impress by it.  If you are such a big fan (fanboy, in other words) of this film that negative criticism bothers you, stop reading know.  Just accept the fact that I disagree with you on this film.  If you do feel the need to respond to my review, please do not accuse me of bashing it just to bash something `popular' or whatever. Please also refrain from accusing me of not getting the film. Thank you for your time. THERE ARE MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW.<br/><br/>********END WARNING********<br/><br/>
Let me begin by explaining what my F means; my F does not mean I think the film is worthless, indeed I admire many parts of it; my F means I think the film failed in one or more fundamental ways.  To make it clearly, my F is closer to 59 % than 0 stars.  With that being said let me give you some history of my reaction to the franchise. I loved the first film; I had major problems with the second, but I really loved the 'core' story. The same is true to a lesser extent for this one. With that being said, Revolutions is pure cinematic trash, asinine action scenes separated by horrible acting, dialog and intellectual masturbation.<br/><br/>I might as well get the improvement out of the way first.  Revolutions is superior to Reloaded in on key way; the fight scenes as a whole possess tension.  This does allow for some excitement, some entertainment when comparing them to Reloaded, but ultimately the action scenes are not good.<br/><br/>First of all, the fights are still overlong, and over blown; the siege of Zion went on far too long, and became monstrous.  The fights are very unemotional, in particular the siege of Zion. The reason for this is the viewer does not give a damn about Zion or any of the characters involved. It is impossible to care for characters if they lack arcs, and a personality.  The Kid (the total lack of anything resembling a name doesn't help either), the Captain, the Commander, and the two women all are plot devices, not people. They're not even caricatures; they lack personality, humanity and the plot lines surrounding them are dissociated to the point that it is silly for a filmmaker to even show their demise and expect a response. This renders the viewers' reaction to the siege of Zion, an event that should be hellish, and enthralling, to be a cold indifference.  It is actually pretty amazing in how bad that scene is; it takes some talent to show humanities' last stand and have people not care.  The only thing on this level that remotely held my attention was the kid. He was kinda good looking and I hoped his character wouldn't die, not because I cared for the character; I just didn't want the actor to go away. That was a very nifty trick to pull off given what was at stack in that scene.<br/><br/>Continuing on with the problems with the siege of Zion, both the humans' and the machines' tactics are mind boggling stupid to the point that it further diluted the tension.  First of all, why the hell didn't the Zionists shoot rockets off at the drillers when they were falling?  It is very possible to hit a moving target with a rocket launcher.  Second of all, why didn't Zion have more of a `outer-shell' defense?  Certainly, any military commander would have set up like a parameter or something.  They could have used EMP (far enough away from Zion to not effect it), or rigged explosives to take down any tunnels made.  The machine did do better however; it was fairly clever the way they protected the drillers directly.  But, the mass of squibs did what exactly?  The more I think about this the more it bothers me. The squibs flew around, and flew around and flew around. Come on, it is only logical they would swarm from one gunner to the next, but they didn't. This really messes with you suspension of disbelief, ergo it lessens the tension. These three problems render the siege of Zion dramatic `junk food;' there is tension, but it is empty tension, like `empty calories.'<br/><br/>
Moving on to another action scene, the so-called `super burly brawl' is a colossal failure as a climax.  The first problem is Neo's entire plot line did not build tension; honestly, the attack of the squib wave totally failed to do this, as it was extremely predictable, and its outcome. The same goes for the encounter with Bane/Smith.  The second problem is this, the Wachowskis, as if determined to have no tension in any fight involving Neo, told us that Smith was going to win, and that Smith knew it.  A totally self-defeating structure renders the `super burly brawl' the biggest anti-climax this side of the back half of the book Return of the King. Furthermore, even if the Wachowskis didn't tell us, that ending is not all that unpredictable.  That fight is the worst possible way to end a trilogy of action films.  It also totally frustrated the viewer as the problem could have been easily avoided; remove that line, and you have removed the problem.<br/><br/>Concluding my commentary on the action scene, the S+M club fight and the chase involving the Hammer were OK, nothing special.  The S+M club fight was a rehash of the ending shoot out in the first film, making it seem uninspired; in fact a lot of the fights carry this problem; the choreography is too much a like to warrant paying attention.  That is to say the `super burly brawl' is like the `burly brawl' in the rain and in the air, a laughable concept that should have remained in animation.  Now that I think of it, the whole rain aspect of that fight was nothing but a cheap way to make it feel dark, and atmospheric. It was forced. Getting back to S+M club fight, it was absolutely ridicules that it was a club of that nature. I'm sure it was done only to get an R rating.  Through in all honesty I totally enjoyed the chase involving the Hammer, and the Cgi was very good, great even. To bad good special effects do not a good movie make.<br/><br/>Now let's switch to the other flaws of this film; the acting was done right wretched.  Reeves is NOT a good actor; he just can't emote good enough to do what the script called for.  Both Moss and Fishburne seemed to be going through the motions. The supporting cast was laughable; the speech by the Captain was as cheesy as big M's in the cave of many nipples. The new Oracle seemed to be a parody of the old one.  The only actor who did a good job was Weaving, who to be fair doesn't have all that difficult of a job.  The past films one could overlook the acting, but not here, and it's detrimental.<br/><br/>Finally let us turn to the gigantic misfire that is the story.  The biggest problem here is, once again, the ham fisted and bulging un-subtlety that the Wachowskis impart the themes, and plot points of the film.  For example, the film once again has a 2-minute speech going over causality; this is intolerable, we got the first time, we don't need it the second time. To make matters worse the speech begins with this phrase `like I have told you before.;' MY GOD, the film is aware it repeats itself, and it doesn't care; there is no need for this.  In the same vain the whole incident with the Indian family of programs is a rehash of the Sage conversation, which itself is a rehash of plot points in Reloaded. At this point in the game we do not need man and machine are alike and need each other explained yet again to us, and that conversation (and the family in general) does just that. Furthermore, the film had the gale, and audacity to explain to us, as if it wasn't painfully obvious already, that Neo and Agent Smith are polar opposites, and Smith is the negative.  THAT IS INSULTING, and it is ultimately un-called for. This is by far the worst example of a director(s) talking down to a viewer that I have ever seen.  Now, the Wachowski are b******s, and twits for doing this, and it really hurts the film.<br/><br/>As an offshoot of this, the whole plot of Neo being in Mobil Ave., or should I say limbo (I sighed when I saw that), is for the most part superfluous. It has no real bearing on the overall plot; the material covered is covered elsewhere, and the delaying of Neo could have been done better. Furthermore, in the grand scheme of things, the entire subplot involving Frenchie is unneeded, and should have been cut. Everything it covered was covered else where, and Frenchie has little to no effect on the over all plot.  Frenchie and his goons are false obstacles; they're red herrings; they extend the films out for purposelessness.  Seriously, what does Frenchie DO in relation to the man vs. machine plot?  He does nothing. The theme material, the causality, the man is like machine, and all of it could have been shown, and is shown by the agents, and Smith.  Returning back to un-subtlety, the film beats it over your head that belief, and believing (through strangely it contradicts itself in what you are suppose to believe in) is the only way to win, or live.  The number of Christ symbols surrounding Neo disgusts me; after the first two, an extreme limited number should have been used.  Revolutions contains so many it would waste time to name, and some are down right absurd; Neo died with his arms spread out like Christ on the cross is asinine, and inane.  The film couldn't resist telling us that Neo is a symbol for the rest of us, GAH; it was painfully obvious without that, bad form Wachowskis.  This again shows how the Wachowskis hold the viewers' intellect in contempt.<br/><br/>Besides being un-subtle, the film fails in the character development department, and dialog.  Trinity over the course of the two films hardy changes at all. the only way, fundamentally she changes is she dies. The same can be said of Neo. Ultimately, this makes the characters un-likable, and makes the viewer not care for them. This lessens the impact of Trinity's death dramatically. It is, also, preposterous that Trinity's `dying breath' is 1 and ½ minutes (if not more); this destroys suspension of disbelief. Big M character has become excess baggage. What does Big M do that is remotely important, and like what he did in the other films? Nothing, he has been reduced to a glorified extra.  He too does not change all that much, and it is haphazard at that.  The dialog is down right bizarre in places; I haven't finish the training program, nor did I, or, what is it going to be Merv? Being the examples. When it isn't it is cheesy, as in it took me 10 minutes to lace up one boot.  The character development and dialog are vile, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>However what really does the film in is the non-ending. The resolution, Neo dying to save man and the matrix leading to peace with the machines, all orchestrated by the Oracle, is a cop-out.  First of all, it doesn't solve anything; the machine stills control most of the humans, and it doesn't seem that they will release all of them.  The peace also seems very tentative, and there is no guaranteed it will last.  Setting that aside, as that is not truly the problem, the simplicity of the message, this choose/free your mind/understand the why (and I'm being generous here), destroys the symbolism set up in the film(s). What's the point of having a symbol for god, if he is bested at his own game? What's the point of having a symbol for devil if he doesn't effect anything? What's the point of having a character named Nairobi? Ect.  Further contributing to this is the film does not account for all the symbols. Really now, what's the meaning for Seraph? There is none; the symbols are empty and meaningless; through undoubtedly some genius will argue this is the point of the trilogy, to which I say bull.  This is the height of annoyance; overt symbolism with no meaning does not a good movie make.  This is, in essence, intellectual masturbation, and as such it leaves the viewer dissatisfied.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/><br/>Cinematic and intellectual masturbation, Revolutions is a grand failure."

","I think one reason why people seem to hate this movie is because they think about it too much. They have expectations, and want everything resolved. I heard so many reviews from so many idiots that kept me from seeing this film, but one day, I decided, I need an opinion of my own. So I went to watch it, without expectations. I just sat there, in the front row, leaned back, and watched it. I had already seen the first two (loving the first, and having mixed feelings of the second), so I kind of thought of what I'd see. I wasn't paying much attention to the story, or the characters. I was just watching it. And after a while, I felt like I was plugged into the Matrix. I had forgotten that the world exists. All the visual effects, the camera shots, the sound, and above all, the lighting, made me feel like a part of it. It was all stunning visual effects that made free my mind, and lose myself, which is what made me enjoy the film so much. One thing that I think the Wachowski Brothers did smartly here, was to keep it low on dialog, and high on visuals, since that's what these films are good at. Visual effects. But what would these battles be, without the actor's facial expressions to express intensity. That was another thing that made me sink into the drama of this film. The writing's not that good though, and the acting wasn't either (with the honorable exception of Hugo Weaving, as Smith). The main characters are not shown that much anymore, which makes this film feel kind of distant from the first two, but still, it's an enjoyable film, that if you sink into, you forget about the flaws, and just become a part of the Matrix. So, seriously, free your mind, and enjoy this."

","Possible spoiler hints  second-to-last paragraph only.<br/><br/>The first Matrix movie was fantastic because it framed an action film inside a cerebral one; it was special both for its revolutionary action sequences and for the novelty of such an engaging `what if?' scenario. The movie had plenty of flaws, but they were easy to forgive because of the sheer originality of the movie's visuals and viewpoint. The Matrix's open ending allowed viewers to draw their own conclusions to all the questions raised.<br/><br/>Simply by making the sequels, the Wachowskis disobeyed one of the first rules of show biz: `Always leave em wanting more.' As soon as I heard they were going to make two sequels, I had a gut feeling, a fear that I would be sorely disappointed. I knew the sequels could never live up to the original, and going into Reloaded with that in mind, I was able to appreciate the movie for what it was, and I forgave its [this time more serious] flaws because I assumed (hoped) they would be resolved or rendered irrelevant in Revolutions. <br/><br/>Revolutions fails to provide any of the positive attributes the first two films. The visual style is no longer original, nor is the philosophical bent, and I found the action sequences to be profoundly uninteresting. Reloaded did one-up the original in its action sequences  the many Smiths scene took martial arts to a whole new level, and the freeway scene delivered a masterfully done car chase, a key element in any quality action picture. What does Revolutions have? A bunch of computer-animated machines duking it out with one another. Most of the action scenes in Revolutions resemble a video game more closely than they do a kungfu or action movie. I doubt I am the only one who does not find watching video games all that interesting. The few non-video-game-like scenes that Revolutions did have were unimpressive, simply because I felt like I had seen them before. In the first film, they had full-throttle action and in the second, they turned on the afterburners. In the third, they just plain ran out of gas - the Wachowski brothers just could not top what they did in Reloaded.<br/><br/>
Without originality or satisfying action sequences to fall back on, what does Revolutions have left? The dialogue is ridiculous, with almost as many cliches as Batman and Robin. There are numerous scenes that seem to serve no purpose  watching it, I wondered how such a widely anticipated, expensively made film could be so flabby. There are also far too many characters in this movie to allow for any kind of character development or for us to care about any of them; besides, the acting was never a strong point for the first two Matrix films, either.<br/><br/>That leaves only the plot itself and its philosophical implications to redeem Revolutions. Once again, Revolutions failed to measure up to its predecessors. While the Matrix was simply revolutionary and Reloaded provided some interesting new twists, Revolutions was almost completely unintelligible. Maybe I missed something because I did not watch Anamatrix or play the Enter the Matrix video game, but most of what happened in the third movie made no sense! Instead of providing answers, which I and other audience members wanted, above all, from the final (God, I hope so) installment in the series, Revolutions delivers ambiguity. Was there a matrix within a matrix? Does the movie end with a new world order, or did we just view one `iteration' of the program? What happened to Neo? What was the point of anything that happened in all three movies? Of course, a good movie should leave the viewer with something to think about, but instead of thinking `what could happen next?' or contemplating the film's philosophical message, after watching Revolutions, I wondered `what the hell just happened?' and `what was any of it supposed to mean?' In my humble opinion, the Wachowskis could not figure out how to write the ending in a way that would tie everything together (without being so obvious as to be unsatisfying) that they just made it as confusing as possible so that there were no true answers and the Wachowskis were completely off the hook.<br/><br/>
Bottom line  a truly good movie like The Matrix did not need to have an `ending' as such, but the Wachowskis insisted on giving it one (`everything that has a beginning must have an end', more like `every film that could have a successful sequel should have two'), and they couldn't deliver the goods. They brought so much philosophy into the first two movies, especially the second movie, that viewers, myself included, expected a plausible, coherent closure from Revolutions. As intelligent as they are, the brothers could not provide it. Maybe they have the whole thing cooked up perfectly in their heads so that it all ties together logically, there are no `plot holes,' and everything makes sense, but even if that were the case, they did a terrible job communicating the conclusion and resolution (if there was resolution  I'm not sure whether there was or not). 2 stars out of 10 for the remote possibility that the brothers actually had something in mind that they were unable to communicate."

","To date, I have yet to have walked out of a movie in disgust.  Watching ""The Matrix Revolutions"", sadly, sent leave-impulses coursing through me during the movie which I had to fight to overcome.  Ladies and gentlemen, it is THAT bad.<br/><br/>*MILD SPOILERS*<br/><br/>The treat of the original ""Matrix"" was just that:  the Matrix itself. The characters are much more interesting within the Matrix, the color palette is more vivid, the story itself becomes a mystery, twisting and turning through the various corridors.  Even in ""Reloaded"", the Matrix still stands front-and-center as the venue of choice in the movie.  Sure, the rave scene sucked, and yes, the philoso-babble was completely overplayed. Tragically, Morpheus' slow decent into utter irrelevancy begins with this movie. There are flaws -- deep flaws -- that lower ""Reloaded"" several steps below the original, and yet in the end, the movie still revolves around the Matrix. Within the Matrix (as always), an engrossing set of circumstances unfold, including the highly-charged (and completely enjoyable) freeway chase scene, the Smith clone battles and the Trinity/Smith showdown, amongst others. No, it wasn't as good as the first, but unlike some posters, I found it to earn a passing grade as a decent and sometimes spectacular sequel.<br/><br/>The third movie fails on ALL counts.  Bizarrely, the Wachowskis almost completely abandon the Matrix in this movie.  The ONE thing that separates this film from another run-of-the-mill sci-fi action movie, and they ditch it.  Instead, we get dour, dingy characters who we care surprisingly little for preparing to battle an inexorable swarm of sentinels that, perversely, I began to root for halfway through the movie.  The sentinel battle was nowhere NEAR as cool as some people might have you believe.  The effects were ok, but definitely NOT ""jaw-dropping"".  We get to see giant swarms of these things getting mowed down by RoboCop lookalike machines, which makes the tense ending of the original ""Matrix"" (where, allegedly, *only* EMPs can kill sentinels) a complete fraud.  The cliched scene where the morphed ""face"" talks to Neo was so bad that it made me yearn for the rave scene in ""Reloaded"".  The Trinity death scene is so absurd that I had to take care not to burst out laughing in the theater.  She's lying there, you sense something is wrong but you can't tell precisely what, then the camera pans out and she's impaled in three places.  You think if you were impaled that you might, you know, scream your fool head off in agony?  How about bleed profusely?  Instead, she and Neo instead have a soft, totally unconvincing conversation (their chemistry is zero) and then she dies.  Lastly, the Smith/Neo battle is bad, anticlimactic and underwhelming.<br/><br/>What a terrible way to end the franchise.  Don't listen to those that say this movie was enjoyable, enlightening, questioned the purpose of existence, etc.  It was an overlong, overloud, overblown yet incredibly underwhelming fraud.<br/><br/>The Matrix:  8.5 The Matrix Reloaded:  6.5 The Matrix Revolutions:  3.5<br/><br/>See the first two but -- trust me -- don't bother with this one.  This is one of those rare cases where you're better off not knowing how it all ends."

","!!!!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>The weirdest thing happened while I was in the cinema with my friend. In the scene where Trinity is talking to Neo for the last time people started talking and giggling. More than half the hall I suspect. It was actually quite funny and surreal and I didn't blame them one bit, it actually probably helped us all to get through the ""Revolutions"" a bit faster. How the hell did they shift the series from being the don't-make-its-stop-`now` :)  movies to the please-somebody,-make-it-end-before-the-cup-holder-gets-over-filled-with-my -vomit. I'm kidding, it's not that bad, I never ever fill it up the whole way. But the ""Revolutions"" still reeks! I briefly read some reviews before seeing it and most of them were negative, which was much better than the opposite because then I'd have bigger expectations which ALMOST always just ruin the movie experience. So bear in mind, I enjoyed the first two movies immensely but I am not a die hard fan of the Matrix nor it's story, the one single thing I was expecting, naturally, was the blaster over-the-top and again incomprehensively unprecedented cinematography and special effects. Naturally. ""Should I stop now, or does this sentence speak for itself. And if it does, would it still have done so had I not mentioned it."" Sound silly, sound confused. Yes, yes, we're learning.<br/><br/>
""Forget the rules that apply to the ""Matrix"" series, come November they apply no more.' Whoa! ""I'm trying to free your mind, Theo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it."" Yeah. Well, that sounds like a pretty good deal. But I think I may have a better one. How about, I give you the finger, and then you give me what I want. "" Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. "" Well, here I am, buster. I saw the first part. I saw ""Reloaded' and the ""Animatrix"", what more do you want me to do??? `Stand up and see for yourself.' What? Why? It's not like that's gonna make one hell of a difference. Are you telling me that when I stand up I'll know what I want? That I'll know what you want me to do? `No, Theo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.' English... `Have you ever had a dream, Theo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?<br/><br/>Easy, my mom' d wake me up for breakfast. `I know exactly what you mean!' -'The answer is out there, Theo, and it's looking for you, and it will find you if you want it to.'- Who are you? I don't know you!? -'Most guys do.'- ??? What the... -'Please Theo, you have to trust me.'- Why? `-I know why you're here, Theo. I know what you've been doing... why you hardly sleep, why you live alone, and why night after night, you sit by your computer. You're looking for him. I know because I was once looking for the same thing. And when he found me, he told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was looking for an answer. It's the question, Theo. It's the question that drives us. It's the question that brought you here. You know the question, just as I did.'-...............! Yes!!! YES!!! I knew it! I knew it all along!. I knew the rumors were true!!! Muahaha. I was right all along!!!I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!!!!!!!!! In your face mom! -'What's he doing?'- `He's beginning to believe.' This is amazing... it's more than amazing....it's phenomenal!!!!!! I finally get to know the answer  to THE question! And to think I almost gave up. OK, OK, guys, so tell me. How DOES Santa Claws manage to bring gifts and presents to every kid in the world in one night? `...??????' -'...!...'-...Come on, tell me!... What?...... Why are you looking at me like that. What'd I do??? Oh don't start with the silent treatment NOW! After all that fancy babble. I WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! `Were you listening to me, Theo?!!!! Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?!!!!' First of all - I was not looking at Santa because he's not even here right now, I think you need to take off those broken-ass shades and No.2  - he aint no woman!, you really should check with your friends on that one. I mean really What's the matter with you guys, first YOU tell me I can get my answers if I just stand up? and then SHE starts talking about my life like she can see through my mind or something, teasing me with YOU KNOW WHO. I'm starting to think you don't want to help me at all. So what's it gonna be? Give me one reason why I should even bother giving you more of my time. ......'You are the One, Theo. You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I have spent my entire life looking for you.' OK....a bit freaky and not very true, but whatever rocks your boat. Go on `You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up. Ironically, that's not far from the truth. ` Just show me the damn truth, fruitcake `You've been living in a dream world, Theo. Free your mind.' Okey dokey.. free my mind. Right, no problem, free my mind, free my mind, no problem, right... ........<br/><br/>Jesus Why do my eyes hurt? ""Welcome to the real world.""<br/><br/>Totally missed the point there. Just like this movie. Those fans searching for answers will be let down immensely, those expecting a fulfilling ending will curse the Wachowski brothers for not at least going for (somebody up there forgive me)your typical Hollywood-ish ending(their anime-ish depressive final showdown between Neo and Smith(even the great Hugo Weaving doesn't seem as brilliant as before)is overblown and disappointing as is the even more depressing and stupid ending where man makes peace with machines and nobody even expects Neo to return(some friends, huh)-they all simultaneously assume and conclude he didn't make it.),  those(me including) expecting your average highly above average and beautiful cinematography and fx will be crying for years to come(sure the fight between robots and humans is great, but certainly not better than the major effects in the first two movies) and those expecting good performances by most of the supporting actors should have known better. Tank and Dozer made sure of that bridge burning in the first one. From the very first Matrix it was always the ""real world"" scenes, be it on the Nebuchadnezer or in Zion, that were the worst, they made the first movie not as fantastic as it could have been and they sucked the first half hour of ""Reloaded"". ""Revolutions"" is hardly anything else than just this - 85 percent of the movie takes place in the real world. There's a whole different feel to the movie, no beautiful sceneries, no worth-mentioning cinematography that made the biggest impression on me and many others. It was a plain action movie without substance or stlye! DID I SAY THAT? I have to face the truth, this was the 2nd biggest sequel disappointment of my cinematic life. I'm still working on my comment for ""T3"".<br/><br/>The Wachowskis failed on every level and people will hate them for that. I hate them for that. I hate them for unintentionally ruining their own movie. Their own. It takes talent to do that. Especially if you spawn a movie such as the brilliant Matrix and then return with a great sequel.<br/><br/>The whole cinematic world was expecting the very best from these two, it was going to be the biggest thing in 2003 and the most important trilogy in recent memory(I'm not counting LOTR movies because they're based on books) ""Revolutions"" is very unbalanced and has numerous meaningless scenes, like the first half hour(deja vu I guess). And when you want a Matrix movie to end you know something's not right.<br/><br/>I predict ""Revolutions"" will fail to amount more that ""Reloaded"", hell, I think it'll have a hard time breaching the 200 million mark in the USA. The same pattern happened with the ""Back To The Future"" series. The first one was an immense hit, an instant cult movie, the second and third were made simultaneously and came to theaters 6 months apart, but because of the not-so-hot response to the second one(because it was reportedly too complicated) the third one (in my mind also the weakest in the series) earned less that it did. The trilogy could have easily been the Star Wars of our generations, but the final part is unforgivingly bad and will be haunting the Wachowskis for a long long time. It just makes me wish they had left the original Matrix movie stand alone. I actually quite like(d) the idea of having the free choice to decide what and how and when and etc. happens to the machines. Having destiny in your own hands, remember. Sad isn't it, they fail at the core of the message that so persistently drove them. It's only now that I realized it. 5/10 DID I WRITE THAT?"

","Matrix: Revolutions has taken the series to a stunning conclusion, a final act with so many implications and so many layers that it is no wonder that so many dismiss it as a failure, I mean you have to be a philosophy major to understand it, and there is alot to understand.<br/><br/>First I must add that I was underwhelmed by the first Matrix, I found it to be original in its delivery but quite basic in its theme, kind of Philosophy 101, Then Reloaded got me pretty excited because I could not believe the path that the Wachawski began to direct the series down. Truly taking it somewhere I though was dangerous because most people would be let down, well that is exactly what happened, these guys are too smart for their own good.<br/><br/>The Matrix series as a whole works on so many levels of consciousness that you can get dizzy trying to connect the dots but overall its about coevolution, the coexistence of Man and Machine, with western and eastern religous parables thrown in the mix. The majority of people that have a negative reaction to it, point their finger at the lack of answers, well in my eyes there are more than enough answers to a plethora of questions but there is alot unanswered because just as in life, not all is known. At the end of Revolutions the viewer is left with what they percieve as a stalemate in the war for humanity. It is more than that, it is the beginning of a process that took a century to reach, the understanding that Man and Machine are the same, that our destiny is to merge, to become one, to evolve together. To fight it is futile. These are issues we face today in the realm of biomechanics, we are mechanizing nature as technology is becoming more human. It makes sense, we have created machines naturally as an extension of ourselves, and as we both evolve we must learn to accept the connection and not fear it. <br/><br/>Anyway, you can look at the film from that perspective, or you can look at the Religous symbolism, or you can just enjoy it as a manic Sci Fi action flick, its all relevant. I myself am just amazed at where the creators of this film chose to go with it because ultimately it is not material that lends itself to big budget action films. I am glad that so many people are disappointed, especially when these same people have been spending a lot of time discussing how much it sucked. That means that it has pushed some buttons, opened some minds and flashed the mirror in our direction, its art."

","""The Matrix"" was revolutionary.  The Matrix Revolutions ought to have been wired into the matrix and used as a battery.  If you want to see a man in a big ""mech suit"" yell a lot while he shoots a couple of big machine guns at a billion sentinels, then go see this movie.  If you are looking for closure to the Matrix saga in a way that all resembles the innovation of the first movie, then do yourself a favour and skip this movie.<br/><br/>Spoliers ahead...<br/><br/>At the end of Reloaded, I thought for sure there were two Matrices - a layer of control within control... a second Matrix nested in the first one... a place where people who rejected the first could escape to without really escaping.  Reloaded introduced the idea that each person had to agree, at some level, to be locked in the matrix.  They had to accept it in order to be kept within it.  Neo, as ""The One"" had power over the matrix because, in part, he would not accept it.  Neo's amazing feat at the end of Reloaded in stopping the sentinels made sense that way - when Neo left the Architect to save Trinity, this rejection of the second ""nested"" matrix would give him power in the second Matrix too.<br/><br/>And so it was with bated breath I awaited Revolutions... thinking for sure that there would be some wonderful twist on this theme.  And while I watched I waited... and waited... until the credits were scrolling.  There was nothing revolutionary in ""Revolutions"".  Just a straining of my ""willing suspension of disbelief"".  Telling me that ""The Source"", some machine God (??) gives Neo power over machines in the real world... sorry, but that is too much to swallow.  ""The Matrix"" used the question ""what is the matrix"" masterfully throughout the whole movie.  To get the full meaning of the show, you had to watch it more than once.  The show was simply overflowing with symbolism and allusion.  Reloaded at least made you wonder. Revolutions just rolled in the mud of the ground that was broken by The Matrix."

","It was inevitable. Another promising trilogy comes to a somewhat mediocre conclusion, though not quite as disappointing as it could have been. In fact, in the end the trilogy delivers exactly what it promised, nothing more, and nothing less.<br/><br/>Well perhaps a little more, but ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is mostly all build up for little payoff. The movie features some pretty amazing scenes and offers a satisfactory conclusion, but was the ending really what all the fans wanted to see?<br/><br/>The final arc in the story picks up with the Sentinel machines continuing on their journey to destroy Zion, mankind's last stronghold during an apocalyptic war between humans and machines. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is continuing to discover purpose both inside the Matrix and outside and must make some hard decisions during what promises to be the last struggle between man and machine.<br/><br/>Fellow humans Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Niobe (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) must also choose between helping Neo or coming to the aid of their city. Their faith in the prophecy of The One shaken, they must decide if their fate is truly being decided by Providence or if their struggle is both aimless and futile.<br/><br/>Meanwhile former Matrix agent turned rogue Smith (Hugo Weaving) is still seeking out his own purpose, threatening both the machines and mankind as he attempts to become the most powerful being in the system.<br/><br/>This all leads to a conclusion that is absolutely stunning to watch but delivers next to nil on the emotional side. ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is a comic book movie for people who just want to watch action, but even they get cheated on that. The first hour is talk-talk-talk with the people of Zion discussing their futures while the resistance struggles to discover their ultimate purpose.<br/><br/>This might all seem urgent and important if the viewer actually felt something for the human's struggle, but such is not the case. Mankind in this film is seemingly devoid of empathy and the actors all say their lines as though their life has been sucked out of them.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's the fact that all the humans we see are all former hackers and web surfers that they seem so soulless, but must every character deliver their lines in Zen-like monotone?<br/><br/>It was okay in the first movie when it was just Morpheus and Trinity, but now that we've gotten a look at the rest of mankind, it's kind of hard to sympathize with their plight. We root for them because they're the good guys, but the ultimate irony here is that most humans here do in fact act like machines. Whether or not this was a bit of subversive humor on the filmmakers' part is up to the viewer.<br/><br/>As Neo, Reeves delivers his full range of emotions, from stoic to ultra-stoic. Reeves has never given a lazy performance per se, it just seems that way since the extent of his acting abilities has always been to look either cool, sexy, surprised or all of the above. However I believe that only he could have brought Neo to life, and his efforts do not go completely un-rewarded.<br/><br/>Fishburne and Moss are still Reeves' back-up singers as Morpheus and Trinity. They do their job as both fighters and psychobabble merchants, but when it's time for us to feel for them, they can't ante up the same effort. Moss is herself given a soliloquy late in the film that is meant to be heart moving, but ends up taking too long to say what the viewers already know and proves we always liked her best when she was beating people up, not professing her true feelings.<br/><br/>Weaving still makes Smith a likeable villain but even he is giving the shaft in favor of endless exposition. However, when he is finally given his moment to shine during a battle on which the fate of mankind rests, he unfortunately becomes a cackling super villain.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are all spectacular eye candy, particularly an assault on Zion that will delight any action aficionado. A nightclub shootout will satisfy fans as well, though it will not go down in history like the lobby gunfight in the original movie. A lengthy and epic fistfight also pales in comparison to the ones in the previous films.<br/><br/>The ending, though confusing, does offer up some answers to questions that have been present in the series. The semi-religious aspects of Neo's destiny also unfold in a not-so-subtle way. It is interesting to see a mainstream movie end the way this one does, though some may wonder if the series was ultimately worth the hubbub at all.<br/><br/>""The Matrix Revolutions"" closes the series on a more human note than the previous film but still lacks the spark of the original. ""The Matrix"" promised more than it could deliver and the trilogy will ultimately be remembered for the advances it created in special effects, not storytelling. Still, gaining immortality in this age is indeed something to be celebrated, an area in which this trilogy will never be in want.<br/><br/>Six out of ten stars. If Neo had know that the free members of humanity were all mindless ravers and pseudo-Zen speaking philosophers, he would have downed the blue pill with a shot of Tequila."
"flunky2k","3","0","0","18 November 2003"," A deliberate debacle
","I have thought about this for a while, and I firmly believe that Revolutions was a deliberate attempt to end the series and interest in it forever. Quite simply, everyone involved was tired of it.  The story was shutdown as expediently as possible to get the world's population of nerds to move on with their lives, and back to Star Trek conventions, where they belong.<br/><br/>And for that, we should say thanks.  Thank goodness there is little chance this franchise will dangle like the Star Wars movies, waiting to ruin decades of anticipation with a horrible prequel.  As promised by the tagline, the end came, and no one in their right mind wants any more.  The actors and creators can move on without the constant question of what is next in the Matrix genre.  Had the movie been great, the series would haunt them forever.<br/><br/>How else can you explain the painful yet curiously amusing references to plot lines of nearly every previously burned out series:  Star Wars, Aliens, Terminator, and I'll even claim Billy Jack.  I about p***ed my pants when the machine evoked a human face to talk to Neo near the end.  And the final showdown between Neo and Smith demonstrates what happens when the irresistible force meets the immovable object.  Not much, other than a walloping big CGI bill.<br/><br/>In the end, the loose ends are hastily knotted, and the script reads like a Rodney King speech.  The audience files out disappointed, but accepting. And pseudo intellectuals and nerds everywhere can let go.<br/><br/>And if you long for more entertainment pitting man against machine, I recommend Maximum Overdrive."

Agent Smith, as always, is great fun to watch.  Trinity and Morpheus are cool, too.

","A slow start to the film leaves you yawning in an effort to stay awake. For the lovers of effects, it is a festival of computer graphics that will leave you awestruck if you can stay awake through the starting dialogues. For those looking for a story, find it elsewhere... After the special effects start around the middle of the film, the story goes AWOL.<br/><br/>The superhuman skill gained by Neo should have stayed in the Matrix but somehow he has become some kind of superhero in real life as well which adds to the loss of credibility the original film had to begin with. With the first Matrix, it had you wondering if it could actually be true and that we may just be part of some monsterous game of ""The Sims"" played by an advanced AI. The second lost some of that credibility and the third destroyed it altogether.<br/><br/>In all, a very lame ending to a very original idea."

","First, I want to ensure you, movie quality is very good (I will talk about why this movie is taken SO bad in audiences later), music is superb as usual, dialogs - good and deep enough to end the story, I won't waste my time talking about great special effects. I think mostly people enjoyed this movie and the rants about it is coming from pseudo intellectuals, which assumed their own theory what it's Matrix and of coarse when their expectations about other pointless philosophical mess is gone, the rant is going wild.<br/><br/>Sure, there are several things which wasn't so perfect - final battle imho could be for a minute shorter, lot of editing could be done better, but in overall it didn't ruined the storytelling which was in first place. Maybe someone who told that one movie made from both II and III parts would be enough and would win people's hearts got a point. Who knows.<br/><br/>I won't touch any spoilers and theories (MWAM,Neo-Jesus,etc.) because they're rather pointless. Matrix from the very first movie has been very concrete with story and I found strange that many people simply didn't get it, maybe they wanted something to dig veeery deep, but....it's there, the front of you.<br/><br/>And message of the movie is not about world, which we can't verify it is real or not, but about what you are, what is your destiny, and what is driving you to fight, love, hope, everything we do. In what name. Why. I think most people don't like this question because it bugs them every day and so... there comes that disappointment. People hates that question because many of them... they just don't like this question and I can't tell you surely why.<br/><br/>And so it is - don't waste your time expecting something, especially from sequels and things you don't get clearly (like original Matrix). You will screw up your movie's experience and ... Try to simply watch this movie. Then you will see trough the layers.<br/><br/>My score is honest 8 out of 10, just a ending as it has to be."

They ultimately ruin  their work and what they attempt to communicate becomes muddy. The creators of the Matrix should have stopped there. It was a masterful film  throughout. The ending was powerful and succinct. It did not need further explanations.<br/><br/>I believe history will show ""The Matrix""  as a wonderful cultural phenomenon and it will  be regarded as one of the great science fiction films every made, much like ""2001"" was  for the 1960's.<br/><br/>But who hardly remembers ""2010"", the sequel to ""2001""?<br/><br/> I believe also like"" 2001"" , ""the Matrix"" sequel's  will be mostly forgotten with time as  well, and seen as an example of an unfortunate period in film making when marketing  and profit take precedent over art and ideas."

","WARNING: SPOILERS<br/><br/>I had debated seeing Revolutions for about a week and a half after it's release. The reason is this: I had been hearing so many reviews by film critics and friends of mine stating that they left ""disappointed"" and ""unsatisfied"". On the day I went to see it, I tried to keep a balanced opinion.<br/><br/>I left the theater wow-ed. It had everything I wanted to see. My questions were answered (for the most part), and the final Smith/Neo fight gave me chills the whole way through. After seeing the Lobby Gunfight in the first installment, I was convinced that nothing could beat it. And once I saw Neo talk to the Source, and get plugged in to fight Smith, I thought ""This is it."" When Smith confronted the Oracle and cloned himself into her, I realized he could be one of the greatest villains in cinema ever. Excellent acting on Weaving's part.<br/><br/>After Trinity's death and fourteen minutes of Man versus Machine in Zion, I was completely satisfied. However, there is one drawback to what I think is one of the best third installments in any trilogy, the ending. After Neo is cloned into a Smith, causes all of the other Smiths to explode, and afterwards dies, the movie is concluded with a bright sunrise over a city within the Matrix(which is not destroyed). I just felt that the ending was a little too happy for me. All and all I thought it was a very fitting third chapter to the Matrix Trilogy.<br/><br/>I felt that Revolutions had a lot of potential to be better than the original. Not in it's originality, but in it's very climactic feel. It was really a film that you really loved or really didn't like.

But quite simply for all of those who think this is the worst movie ever with so many plot holes and stupid points, just do better.  Write a better script with FLAWLESS ideas, solid characters, original plot, and a logical ending. Because even if you can, there's still going to be a pessimistic jerk off to anonymously bash your work out there."

","Back in 99 I was amazed with ""The Matrix"".  It was simply..perfect! Then came ""The Matrix Reloaded"".  I said to my self...well..this usually happens with every follow up movie...so I placed all my hopes on the third one.<br/><br/> I am not pleased at all!  This is a real disapointment for all Matrix fans. If I had never seen the original movie, I would propably rate the last one with a very high note.  But I, as millions others, was waiting for 5 years for this ..big ending; is this actually the end?  Well... all that was missing from the screen was Neo dressed like a cowboy riding towards the sunset....oh..it was a sunrise..right?<br/><br/> What was all this crap about the architect and the oracle? Was all of this just a ... bet between those 2? Who won?<br/><br/> What about the EMP?  In all Zion there was no EMP and they had to wait for a hovercraft to arrive and use it's own? also..all communication was working...but they could not communicate with the hovercraft? Why didn't they shut down the systems when the craft arrived there, instead they left the EMP drain their own energy! Oh..I see..they didn't want to still the glory from Neo becoming the savior!<br/><br/> The producers should have thought harder: The Matrix fans are mostly people associated with technology, they are used to think logicaly, and are used to get their questions answered!<br/><br/> Dialoges: To many and to boring, with absolutely no meaning!<br/><br/> Morpheus: He could have died in the 2nd film, anyone could be a navigator in the hovercraft. Zion: A...free human city , free to live undreground, in the darkness...eating synthetic food! Neo: A hero for mankind AND the machins! would you ever think of that just by watching the first movie?<br/><br/> Ok..a final question: The Architect is supposed to free the humans, so..where will the machines get their energy from now?  Maybe they can ""hire"" some humans and ""pay"" them with a rich life in the matrix or so. But why the hell did the machines use no animals, let's say cows, for their energy? They would even need a much simpler matrix program, just green fields!!<br/><br/> Usually I watch a film at least five times...but not this one!<br/><br/> My rating is 5/10."

","Boy, what a sneaky pair those Wachowskis are!

The epic caliber comes to full tilt in this one.  Everything is done to an extreme, as it should be.  There are just enough answers to leave you, as with the last two films, asking questions as you leave the theater.

"Another_ONE","Null","0","0","17 November 2003"," The original ""Matrix"" didn't need any sequels!!!
","Let me explain my vision of the `trilogy'.<br/><br/>(1) The original `Matrix' is not just a one more superb movie in the world. IT IS A NEW RELIGION! You'll see! I (as, I'm sure, everybody at the subconscious level) had got it at once, because the revolutionary idea of the possibility to find ourselves somehow plugged into the computer generated dream world is even less refutable than the idea of any other already existing religion! Look at what the computers can do now, and just imagine what will they be able to do in some 5-10 years. And what if the original `Matrix' is the accidental direct hit made by the unruly brains of Wachowski brothers (or whoever had suggested them it)?! Can anybody of you disprove it? Don't get upset, because nobody can. (Just in case, I'm saying I'm kidding). Moreover, all the factors, which the successfulness of any movie rests on, such as, casting, direction, design, costumes, performance, photography, etc. where absolutely flawless, while profoundness of some would-be modest thoughts brought by the `Matrix' requires the special thanks (like `Everybody falls for the first time'; it is possible to be the One, not being very smart; `You're waiting for something, may be, for the new life'; some gift reveals itself only in the extreme situation; `Free your mind!' and so on). I think, it has a great positive psychological influence on the audience, because it stimulates people to live and not just exist, it awakes the One in everybody for the everybody to believe in him/herself and start acting in some sphere of his/her life. That's why this movie had become the universally recognized masterpiece. I've met nobody who thinks it is bad or even ordinary, no-bo-dy, except those too gloomy in terms of computers.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: The original `Matrix' should not have any sequel. It didn't need any sequel, letting everybody imagine its own way of destroying the Matrix and beating the machines. However, the millions of fans hungered for the story to go on, and the rules of the show business just forced Wachowski bros to earn more money on it. And let's be fair - in `The Matrix Reloaded' they did their best to justify hopes of the overwhelming majority of the audience, while the hopes of the most fastidious people were `dissatisfiable' by nature. It would be as impossible as trying to add something to the masterpieces of, say, Mozart.<br/><br/>Therefore, I would recommend consider the original `Matrix' separately from the other two parts. In this case you'll definitely feel a sense of relief!<br/><br/>Mark: 20/10 (!!!)<br/><br/>(2) `The Matrix Reloaded' is a very nice action, looking like a thrilling computer game. While in the original `Matrix' Neo was just to believe in himself, in the `Reloaded' he had to explore his obvious super-abilities, understand the reasons of different things' existence in the Matrix, and, finally, find out his own true calling. I think, all these points were shown and developed in the movie almost optimally. To improve it, may be, several monologues/dialogues should be relieved of the extra sophistication to make them comprehensible for all people, and not just for a real fan ready to rewind them for hours to get the point.<br/><br/>Mark: 9.5/10<br/><br/>(3) `The Matrix Revolutions' is, unfortunately, the black sheep which every family has. There are tons of flaws in it which were generated by one main problem: laziness or tiredness of the Wachowski brothers' fantasy. Among the most evident flaws I would mention the following: (a) too much attention paid to such boring characters as Sati & Co; (b) too long (and, again, boring) sentimental scenes of different characters; (c) too primitive tactics and behavior of both machines (which were just flying together and waiting for Zion to spend all its ammunition:) and commander of Zion (who didn't hit upon such easy ideas like, for example, leaving some ships and the big mechanical worriers in reserve) (d) no worthwhile video effect within first 60(!) minutes; (e) vagueness of the story's end; etc.. So, the `Revolutions' is a real disappointment for the thinking part of the audience. Anyway, it is far more than just viewable.<br/><br/>Mark: 7/10<br/><br/>I would also add that the `Matrix' (as well as its sequels) was the first movie which became increasingly interesting and clear for me upon each next review, because every new time you see it, you discover some hidden details or links helping to comprehend the whole picture more properly. If I'm not alone in this respect, then it is really a kind of revolution in the world of cinematography."
"agentmike","Null","0","0","17 November 2003"," Not as good as it could have been
","Watching Revolutions for the first time for me was an odd experience. It seemed to fly by in the cinema and left me wondering where the previous two hours had gone. However, this is not necessarily a good thing, as it meant that a second viewing was necessary to remember a lot of important aspects. This pace was undoubtedly helped by the constant flow of action in the film. Unfortunately, as the centrepiece of the movie is the war in Zion, such action was rather unimaginative (despite being very realistically created).<br/><br/>Its lack of fresh action sequences has led me to appreciate Reloaded a little more. However, the character development is given some attention in this last installment which almost makes up for it. I can't understand the criticisms concerning 'cheesy dialogue' as no phrase really seemed out of place (except for the excessive use of 'goddamit' and the Kid taking us to new levels of aggravation) and verbal humour was extremely well-placed.<br/><br/>****SPOILER***** My only real problem is with the film's ending. Where there should have been some monumental twist to dwarf that of the second film, there was a sugar-coated scene with Sati and the Oracle. Also, the Superbrawl was excellent but they could have made more of it. Unlike the Burly Brawl, I wanted it to continue rather than end as soon as possible.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is entertaining, but nowhere near as well-executed as the first film, and it leaves you thinking that this emptiness might have been solved by either fleshing these sequels out with a better story, or by condensing them into one film."

","After initially seeming like a welcome antidote to the mumbo jumbo guffery that the Star Wars franchise has descended into, The Matrix trilogy has turned out to be even worse.  Every single line of dialogue attempts to be profound, but in reality is cheesy enough to fuel a pizza hut's worth of toppings and stuffed crusts, and the cutting edge action which wowed us all in the first film is replaced with a rusty old bucket of sci-fi stock that we've seen plenty of times before. Boring."

","Revolutions.  I enjoyed it.  (It helped that I saw it in IMAX as the experience was considerably amplified) I found that it was a fitting ending to the Trilogy (although some won't like it, they will have to agree that it was well thought-out and was true to the rhythm of the two other movies). The philosophy and action were both present and of high standards.  Some general and specific questions remain unanswered and it made you think.  Mr. Smith's dialogue notably had a lot to ponder upon.  As for the action, although I was initially apprehensive about the CGI robot fight for Zion, I have to say I was very pleased with the results and felt tension and excitement.  Niobe's intense piloting was also very pleasing visually and paced well within the unfolding drama.   It is true that the chemistry between Moss and Reeve was missing (especially when they kissed), but that was true of all three movies.  I felt much more love between Link and his wife!!  and speaking of secondary characters, they all did a great job, even that annoying kid from Reloaded... The Oracle was not the same without Gloria and Monica was seriously underused.  The one scene she appeared in also turned out to be pretty pathetic.  Mr. Smith's character was great as a whole, but when he came to the 'real' world, it did not add much to the story and it was not particularly well handled by the writers/directors.  We could criticize all we want (the almost anticlimactic final fight, etc.), but push come to shove the movie had a lot to offer and was not a disappointment but rather explored different aspects of the same themes advanced in one and two, with a pretty good mixture of sci-fi, action, philosophy and they even had a few well-orchestrated emotional moments...

","*****Possible Spoilers aheah****** ( though I doubt it very much )--<br/><br/>Incredibly inane load of rubbish!!!  An insulting addition 2 the 'Matrix' series. I'm still not convinced this was the real deal ( it can't be ).<br/><br/>It is truly amazing some of the reviews one can find on this film......stuff like 'Awesome!!' 'Best Sci-Fi/Action in Years!!!' 'Emotionaly and Philosophicaly deep!!!!' PLEASEEEEEEE !!!!!! This is an overlong, Powerrangers movie with sub-par soap opera acting.

Remember Trinity, Morpheous and Neo ?? cauz the Wachoski bros. certainly didn't. Instead we get unknowns swallowing up screen time gallore; the kid ( a simpering little jack@** with the acting skill of a cruton ) Zee, Link, Mifune and some pumped-up woman with a bazooka...........uninteresting characters with Days Of Our Lives dialogue. The main characters we've come 2 know so well are now guest stars. A half-hour of this movie is spent literaly watching giant manbots shooting at tin squids to no logical avail, while the Zionites run amoc uttering silly lines every chance they get. About 15 minutes total is spent in the Matrix, and little ( if anything ) is done there.<br/><br/>As for the ""resolution"" ?!?!!  wait till u see how NeoChrist Superstar ends the war---Makes one wonder why they didn't just unplug Jimmy Carter from the start, at least his education and political experience might have lent some weight to the proceedings in Zion. And the so-called ending;; I was half expecting Annie to come out in her little red dress, twirling & singing TOMORROW!! TOMORROW!! it's just another day away!!!<br/><br/>Nothing is resolved, and i fear part 4 is coming....I can feel the darkness closing around us........<br/><br/>Stick with the first Matrix, it was a movie for adults. This one's for twelve year olds, and not even all of them, my little cousin saw it and thought it was as shallow as a tapeworms' @** ( He's eleven ).<br/><br/>Not worthy of a single star..........I don't care how good the SFX were."
"twoseam","Null","0","0","16 November 2003"," highly problematic
","This could have been a sweet movie.  It really could have been.  I loved the first one, and enjoyed the second, but the third soured the whole experience quite a bit, and tainted my opinion of the Wachowskis and their series of movies in general.  The biggest problems in the movie:<br/><br/>1)  Neo.  Look, I know that Keanu is hardly a great actor, but he didn't write the character of Neo, and the blame for such a flat character falls squarely on the shoulders of the Wachowskis.  Does Neo fear anything anymore?  Does he wish he could just go back to the warm blanket of the Matrix?  Does he have any actaul human emotions that don't involve Trinity? I am not speaking as a critic, or an intellectual here, but simply as a movie goer, and personally I didn't give a rat's ass what happened to Neo. Neo at least seemed human as he tried to figure out the Matrix, but once he mastered the Matrix, he became a plot contrivance, and a philosophicalreat vessel who isn't governed by human emotions, but by theoretical concepts laid down by ancient philosophers.<br/><br/>2)  The other characters.  Let's look past the awful awful Maravingian. Let's forget that rotten cartoon and move on to the characters we were supposed to like.  Like the plucky-kid-who-defies odds-to become-a-hero character who made me scratch my head and say ""Now who was that again?  I seem to remember seeing him in part II, but I can't really remember him doing anything important.""  Turns out he was an important character in the Animatrix.  That's nice.  Does it make me care anymore than I did before? Not a lick.  If the Wachowskis expect me to pay any geek dues and indulge them in their Tolkien-esque universe, than they had better give me characters that I feel warrant the brain cells it takes to remember their face.  Oh, and let's not forget the token nymphish-child-who-tells-great-truths-in-a-simple-voice. Let's just say that COle from the Sixth Sense is light years ahead of her character.  Once again, the characters dissapointed me on every level.<br/><br/>3) The action.  I won't fault the fight for Zion.  It was for the most part, everything it was cracked up to be.  My problem concerned the action inside the Matrix which seems to bore the Wachowskis now.  Just look at Trinity, and company when they storm the Marovingian's club.  They look bored as they fight their way through the gaurds.  I sense no joy until the final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith and by that point it's too late.<br/><br/>4)  The talking/the philosophy.  The questions of the Matrix had many a sci fi fan in throes, and admittadly, the original Matrix asked some nice questions, and provided some very nice answers.  Personally I feel the original Matrix deserved more credit for its intelligence.  But this third film seems to, instead of assembling any origival ideas or trying to challenge us relies on and rehashes the works of other greater thinkers. The whole movie feels like a long term paper with sledgehammer references in place of parenthetical documentation.  It feels as though the Wacowskis are simply trying to prove that they've read more Plato than their audiences. But they don't stop their.  Oh no, they also prove that they've seen more Dragon Ball Z then their audience.  Okay guys, you can out think me and out geek me, but can you make me cry? Part II of this complaint focuses not only on the philosophy, but how the script dispenses such gems of knowledge.  Instead of allowing their ideas to flow through their characters, the Wachowskis instead rely on high school level debates to get their messages across.  Many fine movies incorporate difficult philosophy, such as Clockwork Orange.  But only once in Clockwork Orange does anyone come out and state the theme of free will.  In the Revolutions, the purpose finds its way into the script on many occasions. During these debates I found myself shifting in my seat, checking my watch (which turned out, wasn't actually there, but I imagined a watch to get me through the first half.), and hitting my forehead with the flat of my hand. Now, I have no problem with the Wachowskis slowing the movie down, as I would loath constant action, and unrelenting kung fu, but for the love of the Deus ex mechina, please fill the void with something other than philosophy 101.  You could try character developement, or... character developement.... or well.... character developement.  Make Neo more human. Give Morpheus a pair of balls again.  Flesh out that freakin plucky kid. Anything!  A common misnomer in film states that talking in a film indicates intelligence, and this film falls for said myth.  If I want characters debating their fate, I'll go see ""Roesencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" thankyou very much.<br/><br/>5)  The Wachowskis themselves.  Smugness on the part of the director grates on my nerves, and the Wachowskis succeeded by sticking as many references to other works as they could.  From the myriad of mythological names to the annoying Christ imagery, I could see the Wachowskis hiding behind the camera and enjoying their slickness.  I've got news for you guys, I've seen many many movies with CHrist symbols.  Take Cool Hand Luke for instance. Plenty of crosses decorate the dusty lanscape in that film, but one key difference between the two remains:  Cool Hand Luke made me cry.  In fact, COol Hand Luke provides a great foil for the Matrix Revolutions.  True, COol Hand Luke had its own pretentions such as its ""Fight the man"" sixties feeling, but at least Luke embodied the ideals of the filmmakers without talking like a snotty High School Student.<br/><br/>Despite these sins, The Matrix had some good ideas, and coulda been a good movie, if somebody had just taken an ax to the editing room and carved up the dialogue heavy scenes.  The pretentions of the Wachowskis bogged this movie down terribly, and made some of the film unbearably bad.  Other than that, I'd give it a B-, but as it stands, a C- is a generous grade."

","I'm glad the Wachowski brothers didn't completely lose their touch after making the first Matrix, thankfully they dispensed with the time-wasting fight scenes and overly long action sequences for this second sequel. The actors seemed a little tired in the delivery in some of their lines (the opposite for Hugo Weaving, he seemed madder than ever) and the Oracle's been replaced by another actor (just found out about Gloria Foster' untimely passing). The effects are as good as ever, important characters get injured or maimed, and the film is a decent enough length to tell the story properly (ends a bit too quickly after the climax though).<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead: I thought the man-machine war was resolved a little too easily for my liking, I always thought it would end with one side wiping out the other, instead of the machines basically giving the humans their freedom (who was behind that face? and why did he suddenly 'see the light'?). And what of the after-effects of this freedom? I would have liked to see a little more of the beginnings of this new world order. I'm satisfied with the ending but the Wachowski's could have mapped out a bit more of the post man-machine war timeline."

I am going to try not to compare the three films (this way lies madness). Revolutions was not a bad ending to the trilogy.  I expected much worse. There were questions raised that were never answered and many loose ends. However, that said, it was enjoyable entertainment.  I did not cringe once.. honest!<br/><br/>I have certain questions that I have to ask.<br/><br/>1) When Smith was deleted - all of the Smiths were deleted and since he took over the entire populace and anyone taken over dies - does this mean that the machines now have no power?  Does it mean all humans, except Zion, are not still energizer bunnies?<br/><br/>2) I think Sati was an illustration that machines are as deserving of life as humans.  See - they have babies too.  Was it necessary to have Sati in so many scenes to make that point?<br/><br/>3) Why did they make Carrie-Anne-Moss go out with a whimper instead of a bang?!!<br/><br/>4) I know the Merovingian is the master control program (think Tron), but is he also the godlike presence in the machine city?  Or shall we just think of him as Squidface The All Powerful.  Does he get pimples?<br/><br/>5) Was the Oracle Smith's mother?  If so, that's..that's just not right.<br/><br/>6) One reviewer asked why the machines did not build a tower above the clouds to get power from the sun and not need people/batteries.  Some contractor somewhere must be salivating over that job.  Now let me think - the tallest building on the planet is....and the cloud layer resided at how any thousands of feet?<br/><br/>7) The train station I understood very well - it is midnight on the G line after a renovation.  Does that much bleach exist in the world?  The MTA conductors look just like that.<br/><br/>8) If Smith saw the future - why did he not see himself die after killing Neo - short attention span?<br/><br/>Just think, if everything had tied-up neatly we could start our own Matrix religion.  Communion would be a choice between the red pill body of the creator or the blue pill body of the creator.  Everyone would be required to have total recall and master bullet-time kata.  Did anyone notice how deftly the issue of cyborgs was ignored.  It would not do to have people confuse The Matrix with The Terminator.<br/><br/>The bottom line - Go - Enjoy - Lament."

","The truth behind all these negative reviews is that we were expecting too much from the brothers, they gave us an amazing story in the 1st movie and amazing visual effects in the second. Everyone was expecting so much from the third one, and when expectations are at max you can only go lower.<br/><br/> In my opinion the worst thing that could have happened is that the ending would have sucked and i don't think its the case. Even if people did not like how the story ended i can't see why people say they wasted their money because anyone who admires art and movies would pay anything to watch such visual effects and realism.<br/><br/> And for whoever says that the brothers were only aiming for profit in the last 2 movies i doubt they would have spent so much money to keep the realism of they movie. Anyway or another people would have watched the 3rd installment whether its sucked or not.<br/><br/> So all in all i must say that the Trilogy overall is amazing and visually i think its the best movie to date and i think a 4th installment in a long time ahead wouldn't hurt.<br/><br/> The only scene i negatively will comment on is trinitys death i think the dialogue was a bit stupid between her and neo and it wasn't as emotional as it should have been."
"J Conn","3","0","0","18 November 2003"," Who decided to film the first draft of the script?
","From the first moment I walked out of the appaling Matrix Reloaded, two things were certain in my mind.  The third film would be as bad or worse but I would go and see it.<br/><br/>Unlike the rather confused prophesy/ counter-prophesy/ total nonsense of the film, both my predictions came through.<br/><br/>It had a far superior pace than the first film, in that it did not go from pointless action sequence slamming into a tedious drawn out soliloquy and back again.  Nonetheless, the film featured some of the worst dialogue I have seen outwith a B-movie or TV movie.  Did anyone revise the script at all?  Did not even an studio accountant look at the balance sheet and notice that £300million was spent on effects and £2.50 on script writers?<br/><br/>Did no one ask why the first 30 minutes with Neo in the subway station took place at all?  It appears simply to introduce the little girl and give a reason for Trinity et al to go to a bondage club?<br/><br/>And after the first film heavily hinting at some relgious theme, and the second film laying it on thick, all subtlety was thrown out the window as the third film charged headlong into a bizarre remake of ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"".  After all that money spent on effects, why did they not go the whole hog and add an animatronic John Wayne going ""Aww.  Neo truly was the son of god.""<br/><br/>I gave the second film 3 out of 10.  In all, the third has a better structure than the second (but that is like saying I preferred my heart surgery to my amputation) and one section I actually enjoyed and was mostly impressed by (the first section of the attack on Zion). <br/><br/>
This is countered by an appallingly bad script, a number of pointless or overlong sections and a meaningless and irritating ending.  I wanted to give this film, 3.5 but as I can't it's rounded down to another 3."
"flashheart","6","0","0","16 November 2003"," the best visual effects ever, but ...
","The Matrix Revolutions is the end of the Matrix trilogy, one of the most spectacular trilogies ever. The third film is like Star Wars E6: ROTJ: terrific SPFX, but the film is not better than the first two. Also in this case ROTJ is MUCH better than Matrix Revolutions. Matrix Revolutions can only compete with the first two Matrix films, if the competition is based on the SPFX. The fight between Neo and Agent Smith was really cool and the fight between Zion and the Sentinels. There was actually nothing wrong with the film, but if you leave the SPFX away, then you see that the movie doesn't give anything new. I think everyone has seen enough kung-fu and has heard enough blablabla for now.<br/><br/> The Matrix Reloaded was already a little disappointing compared with the first Matrix, and Revolutions is nothing better. In fact Revolutions was worse than Reloaded. The first movie was SO good, and now those sequels are just common sf-action movies with some bla-bla in it. The Wachowski brothers started with such a great story and idea, but it's like they knew that the first Matrix couldn't be beaten by the sequels. It's a real shame that they haven't made it better while they COULD make it better.<br/><br/> But I have a consolation for the fanatics and freaks. Even though the movie is carried by the SPFX, the characters don't disappoint. Keanu Reeves still plays Neo well, Carrie-Ann Moss Laurence Fishburne are still sympathetic characters, not to mention Hugo Weaving as the evil Agent Smith. He's more evil than ever. They saved the movie from total disaster.<br/><br/> The trilogy will not be forgotten, but it failed where the LOTR trilogy will succeed. That's a fact. The first Matrix was like a McLaren car from Formula 1, racing at 200 m/h, but the engine blew up after the end of Reloaded and it stayed in the pit lane in Revolutions. The ride is over. Lord Of The Rings will win the grand prix with their Ferrari.<br/><br/> 6/10<br/><br/> Neo's life is based on Jesus, Neo is the 'neo'(new) Messiah."

","Okay I have been a Matrix fan since I was in elementary school and i saw the first one in like 5th grade. Now as for Reloaded, did I enjoy it? Yes. Did i find it to be disappointing? Of course. Well anyway I walked into this film feeling both excited and terrified. Terrified because of all of the critics saying it sucked gigantically. Excited because I love this series with all of my heart and knew that it wouldn't let me down. I walked out of this movie extremely pleased but a little sad that there would be no more Matrix movies even though they made one hell of a set up for another sequel. Thats not to say I didn't have problems with this movie. SPOILERS I REPEAT SPOILERS IF YOU A PURIST STOP READING NOW FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
Okay now that all of the purists are gone (if you are a purist and you still haven't gotten the idea don't say i didn't warn you). First, Trinity's death scene. I can't remember the last time I was in a movie theater and was trying so hard to keep myself from laughing my ass off. I mean first of all after the first movie I really just stopped caring about her. Carrie Anne Moss was excellent in the first movie but her character has had nothing to do in these two movies. And her last scene had just probably one of the worst monologues I've heard in a movie this year. My second problem is Neo's trip to the Machine city. Umm okay why don't we get to see almost anything that happens on their trip over. They are more than 100 kilometers away from there so how the hell do they make it there that fast! But this is a minor problem. Other than the character of the kid, who was quite tiresome, I liked this movie quite a bit. The assault on Zion was to me an amazing scene. Niobe's character was just so cool in this movie and Jada Pinkett Smith did an amazing job as her in this movie. The super brawl was incredibly cool especially Agent Smith's monologue. He is the single most interesting character in these movies, though Seraph, the Merovingian, and of course Morpheus come pretty damn close. This movie may not please critics but it has made me content with this series. So anyone who loves the Matrix but is afraid of what they'll see in this movie, please give it a chance.

","THERE WILL BE SPOILERS.  Before you stop reading to avoid finding out the ending that supposedly wraps up the issues raised in the first two Matrix movies, let me suggest that you'd do better to just make up your own resolution.  It will make more sense than what you see in this movie.<br/><br/>And for those of you that already saw the movie & thought the convolutions of the script were evidence of a great & complex movie, stop working so hard to reconcile this script.  You're putting more energy into this than the script writers did.<br/><br/>First of all, the symbolic & philosophical ideas that worked for me in the 1st 2 movies got diluted here.  Neo, AKA Jesus Christ, is going to sacrifice himself to give us back our freedom to choose, even in the matrix.  Smith, who already represented the matrix society's need for choiceless conformity, fittingly clones himself to fill that conformity.  Would've been nice if this movie spent more than just the last 5 minutes on these ideas.<br/><br/>
Too much of the movie is spent on fight scenes involving myriad waves of squid repeated over & over ad nauseum.  I'd rather see the myriad Smiths. In fact, I think anything in the matrix beats watching World War Squid. This Human Vs Squid War, reminiscent of H.G. Wells ""War of the Worlds"" in its squidliness, leads to a climax of Neo Vs the anti-Neo Smith, or is it an anti-climax of anti-writers, culminating in the antithesis of logic? ...*Big-Time Spoilers follow*...<br/><br/>For a movie series that prides itself on logic, the ending is completely illogical.  Although Neo returns choice to the people in the matrix, he apparently is also rescuing the matrix from the demise left by Smith.  The machines agree - scout's honor - to back off if Neo rescues them from Smith. I have several problems with this resolution.  (1) If the matrix was designed to keep humans pacified in order to make good batteries of them, a world of only Smiths mean only good things for Neo's buddies in Zion. (a) Either the humans have all died (since we were told that if you die in the matrix you die in the real world) & there are already no more fuel sources for the machines, or (b) the humans have all woken up because they were released from their dream-state.  Either way, they're no longer helping the machines.  And (2), that crap about the machines willingly backing off from finishing off the humans because of their ""deal"" with Neo makes no sense. There is no advantage gained for the machines by this ""truce"" since the machines easily have the upper hand at this point.  Are we to now believe these machines suddenly have a morality when it comes to dealing with humans, whose only interaction with the machines has been as batteries or battle casualties?<br/><br/>Also, there are other problems... (1) As a friend of mine warned me before I saw this movie, there is no valid explanation as to how Neo gains powers over the machines in the real world. (2) If the machines are so smart that they can turn the human race into copper-top zombies to serve at their ionic pleasure, how come they can't simply (a) re-program the matrix themselves or (b) return it to an earlier state, or (c) just remove or replace the Smiths programatically?  Are we to believe that the millions of machines that conquered the surface of Earth can't come together to write a better program than a man from 200 years earlier?  And what's at risk anyway, the Smith program already took over the matrix?"
"wmhogg","Null","0","0","15 November 2003"," A Terrible Disappointment
","I just saw Revolutions. My love affair with the Matrix that began in 1999 is now over.  The Wachowski brothers have followed the George Lucas formula for movie trilogies: (1) Great first movie (2) In the 2nd movie, deconstruct the premises and change the ""truths"" in the first movie. (3) In the 3rd movie, continue to change the premise of the original movie to the point that the 3rd movie is unrecognizable to someone who has only viewed the first movie.<br/><br/>While the special-effects were draw-dropping, I feel like I didn't see any character development from the main characters.  I also didn't see the relationships develop further.  I've seen the first two movies 6 times at the theaters, and countless times on the DVD's I own.  I own the Animatrix and have read nearly all of the online material.<br/><br/>It seems like the main story line became an after-thought.  The resolution of the conflict with the machines was unsatisfying.  The main love story was terminated very uneventfully.  The minor characters became the featured players in ""Revolutions"", which is sad. How did Morpheus react to Neo's and Trinity's death?  How was his belief in the Oracle altered, or reinforced? What was the future of Morpheus and Niobe's relationship?<br/><br/>The end of the movie was fitting in that the people I could have cared least for had the featured roles.  I'm sure that there was a reason for the people acting like machines and the machines acting like people, but I don't understand it in the context of the first movie, still my favorite of all time.<br/><br/>I felt a deep sense of loss when I left the theater.  My gut feeling is that the Wachowski brothers had tired of the main characters and just dumped them all unceremoniously.  I agree with them.  Now, I don't care about the Matrix either."

","It's one of those movies that you walk out of thinking ""damn, that was a lot better than I expected"" until you take a moment to think about the entire plot that resulted in this one. If you watch the three movies in sequence, you'll realize that the three seem like a story told by someone who doesn't know how he wants it to end. Someone told me ""they intended a trilogy."" Well if they did, they intended it without having written it out.<br/><br/>I'll start out with the good. Smith is badass. Period. Everything with him is awesome. The way the clones were EVERYWHERE watching the fight looked cool as all hell, and the fight itself was well done. I liked the environment of the Train Man. The Bane revelation was awesome. The creator was one of the coolest things I've ever seen in a movie.<br/><br/>Now, the bad. The explanation for the Oracle having a new actress was awful. I would have easily bought that we simply had a new Oracle with no memory of the first, not that it was the same one in a different ""shell"". Whatever.<br/><br/>The idea of the war was pretty bad also. At the end of the first Matrix, the idea was that Neo would lead us to the liberation of the human race and that we would defeat the machines and get our planet back. I guess the Wachowski brothers decided that wouldn't work, because now the idea is that we just want our little hole near the earth's core and leave us alone you can have the surface thanks.<br/><br/>The Architect scene from Reloaded stands the test as being awesome, since everything he said happened. This is the shortest summary possible of the movie: Neo and Trinity die, Zion gets blown all to hell, Smith vanishes, and the Matrix reboots, starting all over. Now, maybe I'm not catching something, but how can the Architect promise to liberate any humans who want to? If the machines need humans to operate... it seems to me that maybe a few weeks after they all get liberated the machines are going to want some humans back. So hooray, we start from square one.<br/><br/>I suppose that's the intent of the movie, if you want to look at it as an apocalyptic story: we lose, we can't win, and the best we can hope for are a few glimmers of peace between war.<br/><br/>But there's other stuff that makes no sense, such as Neo being able to blow up everything in the real world, but back in the Matrix he gets his ass kicked every time he's in a fight. And maybe it's just me, but after following the cable lines and doing all that, and then we find out that we can get rid of them by just flying above them, why didn't we just fly above them? Apparently they can't go in the sky, so get our asses up in the sky.<br/><br/>And I also think the humans should have more than just one of those damn EMPs. One of them took out that whole swarm of sentinels and the two drill things, so just have a few more. Hell, fly up in the sky and start dropping those things like firebombs over Germany. If I was in charge, this war would have ended pretty fast.<br/><br/>Speaking of stuff ending fast, Trinity's death sequence took up nearly 75% of the movie. 20% was the big fight in Zion, and the remaining 5% was some hit-and-miss storyline development. The good storyline developments, as in all three movies, were explanations of what keeps the Matrix going and what its various parts are. The bad parts are when we start up with this war crap. I remember in the first movie a single sentinel or two being simply disastrous. Now all of a sudden a ship can outrun and escape a few thousand of them. And don't even try to tell me that in a few months our technology got that much better.<br/><br/>I also felt no sympathy for the girl. She's a program, I don't care if we save her. Actually, I want her dead. And her parents, Smith, the Oracle, and everyone else. They're the Matrix, the idea is to get rid of them, not save them. I don't care if her purpose is to make rainbows, she's still on the side of the machines.<br/><br/>I, honestly, would have much preferred the trilogy to not have moved so quickly. If the second movie had involved Neo pulling people out of the Matrix and slowly gathering the army, and the third was the army preparing for war, and we were left with a ready-to-roll army about to wage war on the machines, with a glimmer of hope that we would win, I would have been 100% satisfied. In fact, in each succeeding Matrix movie, we're in the Matrix less and less. In the first one, the bulk of the war was fought in the Matrix itself. The second was half in and half out. The third was entirely out, with the very beginning (retrieving Neo and the Oracle stuff) and very end (fighting Smith and the Oracle with the Architect) being our only glimpses in there.<br/><br/>Neo being able to control the Matrix actually ended up being pretty pointless. The only thing it got us was a few answers out of the French guy. The entire war was fought in the real world.<br/><br/>In fact, the only thing Neo did in the Matrix that had any bearing on the plot was make Smith really powerful so they could destroy each other later. Actually that was all Neo seemed to do. He showed up, the Matrix made Smith to balance things out, and they killed each other, along the way completely destroying Zion and at the end giving us the impression that the machine would let us live in our hole for a while. That's all that happened in the end. In exchange for help destroying Smith (which only existed because Neo existed), the machines let humans survive. Actually, had Neo been killed anywhere else in the movie, Smith would have died and the machines would have killed everyone.<br/><br/>Let's review the Neo/Smith/Creator conundrum. Neo was created, creating Smith. As one increased in power, so did the other. Smith was powerful enough to take over everything, including the world. The machine saw this and let Neo fight in exchange for safety for a while. Neo and Smith are equal opposites. In order for Smith to be capable of taking over the world, Neo must be capable of stopping him. It's not like a situation of ""Smith can do this, let's hope Neo is strong enough."" If one is capable, so is the other. If Neo dies, Smith can't take over the world and he dies. Actually, not ""if"". If you stopped to think about it, Neo -COULDN'T- win that fight. And Smith didn't really win, either. Had they just kept fighting, it would have gone on forever, they were complete equals. So Neo let himself be destroying knowing Smith would die also. You following? There was no mystery about that fight. They both were going to die, it was foretold as soon as the Oracle said ""Smith is your negative"". Why? Hell, it's math. What happens on one side happens on the other. Neo dies, Smith dies. Neo lives, Smith lives. In order for it to end, both had to die. And as a result, we got absolutely nowhere.<br/><br/>ACTUALLY, Neo's presence totally screwed everything up. In the FIRST Matrix, the machines weren't attacking. The only danger of them was when ships ventured out to liberate humans and go scavenging. Neo shows up and the machines wage war on Zion. So now we've determined that Neo accomplished nothing. Let's break that down a bit, okay?<br/><br/>1) A few humans are still alive near the Earth's core where the machines can't go (but they do later, so we'll ignore that), and live a miserable life, but aren't attacked. Meanwhile, everyone else is still in the Matrix.<br/><br/>2) Neo shows up, Smith happens, and the machines wage war on Zion.<br/><br/>3) Neo and Smith both die, Zion is totally destroyed, and the Matrix reboots.<br/><br/>4) A few humans are still alive in Zion, live a miserable life, but aren't attacked. Everyone else is in the Matrix, but now they can be liberated if they want. At least until the machines lose too much power and need them back, then they'll wage war again.<br/><br/>If I had to grade Revolutions, I'd give it a 7. Totally objective review. If I had to grade it in terms of how it took the story along, it would get a much lower score. Sorry to make you read all that (if you did at all), but that's my review.<br/><br/>
PART 2: Many of my complaints still hold (the shoddy explanation of the new Oracle actress, why only one damn EMP, those things), but my idea that the plot as a whole went nowhere, though true, could have been the intention.<br/><br/>I truly doubt that, since the ending was portrayed as though that was the victory that they had all hoped for, but if you back up a bit and think about it, it's a pretty cool apocalyptical message: The machines win, and the best we can hope for is to be allowed to survive.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the directors/writers made it seem like that was a ""victory"" and gave us that damn rainbow ending. That might have been my problem. After three movies, we still lose. This ""one"" was no more special than the others. And, as such, we'll come across another, and the whole thing will start over again.<br/><br/>Although, the thing I don't get is that if there was more than one ""one"", why in the first Matrix, they determined that all this had happened a few hundred years ago? Are all these ""ones"" happening and Zion is being destroyed and rebuilt happening every year or so? Why didn't Morpheus know? If he didn't, that means that it would have had to have been before his time, and I doubt ""ones"" were happening a few weeks after the Matrix was up and operational.<br/><br/>Actually, a whole lot of the explanation would have had to have taken up MUCH more time than Morpheus had said. Logically, there are kids around in Zion now (The Kid, for instance), who would remember Neo if another ""one"" comes around. We didn't get any indication that they recognized what was going on, so they must pop up every hundred years or so. As such, there's no way there could be any before him, unless the layered Matrix theory holds true. In that case there could be a ""one"" in Zion right now, and the cycle will continue forever until the end of time."

","After seeing The Matrix Reloaded, earlier this year, I was quite hopeful on the third part of the series entitled The Matrix Revolutions. I was expecting that the characters I ran into in Reloaded would have some significance to the story of the Matrix and I was expecting that the story would take an original twist or two. Well, I must say that not unlike many others I was disappointed and I guess many others will yet have to be disappointed.<br/><br/>The bad thing about the Matrix Revolutions is that it is neither The Matrix, nor the thing Reloaded promised us. The Matrix introduced us to some very interesting and ingenious new characters, who I thought (and perhaps others too) to have some sort of higher relevance in the Matrix story. Well, they do not! I expected that there was more behind Persephone, Merovingian and his henchmen, but there wasn't. But what is worse, I thought that after Reloaded, Revolutions could still be original and inventive cinema. It couldn't.<br/><br/>The main complaint I have about The Matrix Revolutions, is that it is not what The Matrix was. It is not a cybernetic spectacle with high intelligence. It is rather an uninspired, destruction derby of the likes of Independence Day and other disaster / destruction movies, where everyone and everything within range is crushed and demolished, (in an attempt) to enjoy the viewer. Well, Mr. and Mr. Wachowski. If I wanted to see such trashing and demolition, don't you think I would have watched Bad Boys 2 in the cinema. Really, how unoriginal of you.<br/><br/>Another thing that really struck me, while I was watching the film was the immense stupidity that was called Neo in this film. Sure in the first film he was rather ignorant, but he learned and by the time I watched Reloaded he had learned immensely and I would have actually thought there was some brain in the man, but that vision I held of Neo was completely destructed whilst watching The Matrix Revolutions. I mean, how can it be, that Neo (also called The One, as in our last hope) can sense things, other people cannot even see, while he still remains unable to figure out things any human being with the IQ of a biscuit can hear (you'll know what I mean when Neo is aboard ship with Trinity). That was such a lame scene and I saw it coming like 10 minutes beforehand (including an intermission of about 5 minutes though). Saying this, I'm already at my next point of complaint and isn't it easy today? What is that complaint you ask? Well what abut the fact that this film is too predictable at times. I mean not just the usual, I was actually saying the lines of the characters in my head, before they uttered them themselves. How about that? That does not only mean that the lines were not good, but also that the scenes were not always good, or why else would I be thinking about what the character might say next?<br/><br/>So far, one could conclude that I had a pretty shitty afternoon, watching this multi-million dollar slice of film-making, but that is not true. I was neither bored, nor mad. Instead, I was only slightly entertained and a bit disappointed. Especially with the ending. I could have done dealt with it, if the film had ended, when The Architect left, but the part that came after he left, what the hell was that all about? It did nothing, but leave me with some odd taste in my mouth (this is a figure of speech).<br/><br/>The thing with this film is, that the original, inspiring and truly great thing that The Matrix was (and that Reloaded built on), was (in my opinion) destroyed with Revolutions. For me (an owner of The Matrix), this means that I will hold on to that copy for as long as I can, for it is a truly amazing film, but that I will not have anything to do with the other two parts. As far as I am concerned the story about The Matrix begins and ends with the first film. Not only because after seeing that film, you have about as much questions left as you have after seeing all three films, but also because the other films are just not too memorable. I'm really disappointed that Mr. and Mr. Wachowksi made two sequels and I must honestly say that I expected more from men who could invent such great stories as Bound and The Matrix. You know if there is nothing more to show, don't show it, just because you can get the money, or because all the actors have their autographs on a contract. If the sequels are not up to the original (in Revolutions' case NOT EVEN CLOSE), do not make them. I hope that the Wachowski's learn from this, that not all ideas are great and that not everything should be turned into a movie and in a way, I guess I hope that 'we' viewers learn that too. But, maybe I am to blame for expecting intelligent film-making.<br/><br/>
7 out of 10<br/><br/>
post scriptum: while I was writing this comment I found out, that Gloria Foster, the 'original' Oracle, was not in this film, because  she died before her scenes for Revolutions were shot. I am very sorry to hear that, because she gave so much fun and flavor to The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded. I must admit though, that I was a bit astounded as well, because there was no 'In loving memory of.' right after either Reloaded or Revolutions. I could continue my criticism about this film at this point, regarding the new oracle, but I will not. I just want to reemphasize that Mrs.Foster did a great job as the Oracle and that she will be missed."

","The whole NYC crowd laughed throughout the movie. Every time the noise<br/><br/>and action died down enough so that the dialogue had to fend for itself, it<br/><br/>proved to be laughably lame and wooden, and everyone in the theater was<br/><br/>reminded that there weren't a whole lot of actors on the Matrix payroll. On that level, Matrix Revolutions was a failure. I mean, Keanu Reeves is bad enough,<br/><br/>but I kept expecting Ben Affleck to walk onto the set and start reeling off gritty, recycled, heroic, military-action-flick one-liners, all without ever losing that silly smirk that he always has on his face.<br/><br/>
But I realize that the accomplishment of the Matrix film might lie elsewhere (I mean, besides the visual style, which remained stunning, even in this poor<br/><br/>conclusion to the series).  I think what the W brothers have given us is a<br/><br/>metaphor empty enough that everyone who sees the movie, from third graders<br/><br/>to PhD's, can argue at length about ""what it means.""  All those grad students, IMDBers, bloggers, comic book fiends, and technogeeks out there can state with utter conviction that the Matrix is really all about _______, and they can all be right!  That's the beauty of the trilogy.  It's an incredibly rich and complicated network of signifiers without any definable connection to any set of signifieds. Another way of saying this is that the Matrix is so filled with ambiguous symbols that it can mean virtually anything, which means that, in the end, it means<br/><br/>virtually nothing, in and of itself.<br/><br/>
I've heard it myself.  I've listened to two reasonable, intelligent adults argue about specific moments in the film and what they mean in terms of the<br/><br/>constructed, mediated nature of reality.  The fact of the matter is (at least I think it's a fact) that the movie can be used to support nearly any ontological position imaginable.  What the W brothers have created here is not a statement so much as a vocabulary.<br/><br/>
I guess that could be either positive or negative, depending on one's point of view.  On the negative side, I keep thinking of the Yeats poem, ""Second<br/><br/>Coming,"" which foresees the end times, when the ""best lack all conviction.""<br/><br/>Maybe the Matrix trilogy is a true product of our age--an incredibly consuming (time, money, creative effort, careers, etc.) venture that looks great but says nothing.  On the positive side, maybe it's a good thing to give people a<br/><br/>philosophical language that is both accessible and flexible, without the<br/><br/>complications of history (as is the case with religious vocabularies) or<br/><br/>intellectual elitism (as is the case with most academic, theoretical vocabularies).<br/><br/>
I'm still trying to figure this out, but I guess the Oracle would tell me that I already know the answer; I just have to understand my choice (or something<br/><br/>suitably cosmic and empty like that).<br/><br/><br/><br/>P.S.  I would be remiss not to include in a list of Matrix accomplishments the opening of the cast to all genders and ethnicities.  It is good to see strong, and sometimes even interesting, characters of many colors and sexes.  I like that about the movie."

If they had just slowed down a bit, they could have passed through the gate when it had opened up so wide that the ship could actually fit through, instead of crashing through the doors and wrecking the ship.<br/><br/>And why on earth (or rather in earth) didn't they have emp's (or whatever they were called those things on the ships that emit electromagnetic pulses that shut down all machines nearby) in their defense system around Zion? It really isn't nescessary to sacrifice logic for action in this way.<br/><br/>This movie also contained an annoying amount of war-movie clichés (God I hate war-movie clichés). Apart from that, there are definately scenes here that warrant the price of a ticket. That would be the computer-generated scenes."

","As with all art you either love it, tolerate it, or hate it.  The Matrix was a good sci fi movie, it ranked up there with Alien and blade Runner.  It was original, the effects were groundbreaking and the action was integral to the movie.  Matrix Revolutions certainly tied the loose ends but it could have been at least 40 minutes shorter.  Reloaded and Revolutions should have been one movie, period.  The action scenes were simply tooooo drawn out.  The effects were seamless and brilliant in some scenes and absolutely awful in others, but in general there were just too many of them. ""OK we need to make three movies, a.k.a. LOTR, lets cram in some more action and more effects"". I felt like walking out I was so bored.  The brothers certainly dropped the ball and relegated the Matrix to mediocre at best."

From what I've understand, the bottom line of this movie is that everything that has a beginning has an end, and so everything that has a purpose , once it finished filling it's purpose, it ends. This movie's purpose was to make a lot of money, no more than that, and it's certainly managed to do so."

","for all you out there who have beefs about the action scenes in the the matrix trilogy but enjoy the themes and philisophical messages then go watch The Truman Show. Seriously, The movies are actually quite, if not remakably similar. They both hinge on issues of control and choice. Both films depict trapped characters, or character, who are given a choice about the false reality in which they were born into (""even if they are only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level""). Just as humans have the choice to reject the matrix so does truman. The arguement is made in both films about this false utopia being better than the real world, and then the same counter arguments are made! You can even pick out who the characters would be in the other movie. Well i won't point out all the similarities (i leave that up to you!). So, go check it out.

","We all had high expectations for Reloaded and to many of us it was a disappointment.  Reloaded did what Back To The Future Part II did for BTTF part III, Which seemed as a giant 2hr. previews to the 3rd installment, in able to have a trilogy they threw in a pointless sequel. It's not that I didn't like Reloaded, I actually did, I thought it was enjoyable and really it wasn't pointless it was a good film but it lacked something that the original and Revolutions had mainly you felt for the characters, in Reloaded you didn't care who lived and died, they where just there and there was no real sense of danger or suspense, just action flying explosions and stunts, that got a little tiring to watch.  Revolutions had a ""story"" to it and you felt for all the characters even Agent Smith you felt for, which is a big factor for me at least to truly enjoy a film.  Hugo Weaving did such a wonderful acting job as Agent Smith, his expressions and dry humor made him very enjoyable to watch. (SOME SPOILERS) The ending was predictable as you basically knew what Neo has to do in order to establish peace between the Human and Robot race, I did think it was creative how he must become him in order to destroy him and save mankind and robot kind and the finale confrontation between Neo and Smith was very well done, unlike the battle in the park between Neo and Agent Smith's which got tiring after awhile this ultimate match was one on one and great! Another thing I enjoyed about Revolutions is that the use of the Bullet time affect was toned down allot, I personally think they over did it in Reloaded, Yes I get it they can use a slow motion effect and alter The Matrix code by it, by why show it over and over and over and over and yes over again during the action scenes? In Revolutions you already understood that and I guess the directors got that point that the audience does not need another lesson of bullet time, so this time around they mostly used Bullet time in a normal time lapse which I thought was great and actually more entertaining then the slow-mo which yes I do understand the concept and why they filmed it like that and they did use a few times but not all the time. I can go on and on about The Matrix and it's influence on film culture and the meanings and so fourth of different aspects of The Matrix series but I'll bore you and I'm sure you've read enough so I'll end now. All in all Revolutions was a great film not as good as the original but better then Reloaded, you felt for the characters and it had a great storyline, you felt the directors just got Reloaded out of the way to do Revolutions, you saw they put heart into the finale installment of ""The Matrix""<br/><br/>I give Revolutions ***out of 4 The Matrix ****out of 4 Reloaded **out of 4"

Instead all we get is a futuristic gun battle, which is just fine in a simpler ""good vs evil"" plotline (Star Wars, for example). Smith should have stayed dead at the end of the first Matrix. As much as i loved Hugo Weaving's performance, the Smith plotline was treated as a distraction until the last fight.<br/><br/>With this movie, the Wachowskis clearly show themselves to be one-hit wonders.

","I am a fan of the Matrix.  I also appreciate good cinema.  When I first saw the original Matrix, I was impressed.  It was a unique if not wholly original concept, coupled with some amazing action sequences and fight scenes.  It was a treat, and I have been looking forward to the newest installments for some time.<br/><br/>Watching Reloaded, roundly praised in some circles and booed in others, the concept felt more routine the second time around.  There wasn't that same feeling of going down that rabbit hole and seeing what was on the other side.  But it was a thrilling romp, with one of the all-time best cinematic chase scenes on record, and most fans, namely among those, the ravenous ""Matrix Fanboy"", could forgive this, knowing the be-all-and-end-all of cinema was just around the corner, and that all of the questions that were raised in the first two films would be answered soon enough.<br/><br/>Therein lies the problem.  As the cult of ""The Matrix"" grew from its humble and surprising 1999 debut, fans built up what was an outstanding action film as the next cinematic epic, and that it is not.  Enter November.  With four years of anticipation and what amounted to a full length cinematic trailer released earlier in the year for the conclusion of the trilogy, expectations were sky high.  So the real question is, does Revolutions deliver?  That will depend largely on what you expect from a movie.<br/><br/>I could dissect this movie, tell you that it was slow to build, that a lot of questions do remain unanswered, and that the writing will not be nominated for any awards any time soon.  But I would then follow those statements with a question.  Is that really what you came to a movie like this for?  The writing has not grown worse, nor has the action become any less compelling throughout the life span of ""The Matrix"".  What has grown is our expectations.  Call it Star Wars-itis or trying to find the remedies for our problems in the form of cinematic opium, in waiting for ""the next big thing"", we were surprised to find that what began as an action trilogy has ended as an action trilogy, and those who were waiting for the greatest movie of all time were left with an empty feeling.<br/><br/>Is this, then, a bad review?  Quite the contrary.  I was compelled by the action and what may go down as one of the most intense final battles in movie history (the battle for zion as well as Neo's duel with Agent Smith). I was touched, even, by characters that other reviewers have booed as being ""unlikable"" and<br/><br/>(MAJOR SPOILER ALERT)<br/><br/>found myself saddened by the demise of both major and minor characters.<br/><br/>(end spoiler)<br/><br/>This final movie certainly didn't go where I thought it might, but in the end, I didn't care.  It was compelling, it was one helluva ride, and I thank the Wachowski brothers for sharing their vision with the rest of us.  If anything, I feel sorry for them, for shouldering the Atlas-like pressure of pleasing thousands of rabid fans, all of whom have been salivating for something deeper and concocting scenarios that even these fine craftsmen would strain to put on screen.<br/><br/>So call it what you will, but don't call it bad cinema, because once the action began, it grabbed me, and I didn't care where it took me, because I wanted to see it through to the end.  You won't find the answer as to why Neo can blow sentinels apart through his pure force of will, but in the end, you may find that it didn't ever matter why in the first place.<br/><br/>

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** And you know the best thing about it? I was in the cinema on my own!!!! :D Probably shows something about the popularity of the movie but it was only half 5 and I'm not complaining! £5 for my own private screening! Not bad eh?!<br/><br/>So, anyway.....<br/><br/>I'd read bad reveiws and a few of my matyes had seen it and said that it didn't make much sense but I understood it completely! The Matrix is one of those movies that if you  understand it, it's brilliant, and if you don't it's just a load of fightinh and cool CGI (Which was very cool, btw!) People have been moaning about the acting as well but I thought it was pretty good. Action films aren't the best genre if you wanna show of peoples acting but I thought the actors were great. I'm not usually a fan of Keanu Reeves, I find him a bit flat but the role of Neo fitted him well.<br/><br/>I loved The Matrix and Reloaded because they were obviously sci fi (Not that Revolutions wasn't, but hear me out!) They were unique, different, interesting. Despite my imense enjoyment of Rev, I found myself resenting the fact that they had turned it into a cliched war movie. I was comparing all the characters to characters in Pearl Harbour and I didn't like it. ( The kid as that chef guy played by Cuba Gooding jnr for example.)<br/><br/>It made me cry when Trinity died. Lots. IT was obvious she would when they flew above the clouds. And Even though it was cliched (I found myself second guessing what they were going to say and the dialogue in places was a bit predictable I found the human side of it quite interesting.<br/><br/>Curiously though, I didn't find Neo's death at all upsetting!! It's been painfully obvious from the word go that he was going to die, so I wasn't at all suprised. I as longing for more good old fashioned kung fu, there wasn't enough going on in the actual Matrix. The bits I enjoyed most were all inside the matrix. I lkied the bit when they went to see that frnch guy (name escapes me) and they were fighting those guards. Not really that great a scene but I liked it for the simle fact that it reminded me of the original.<br/><br/>The highlight by far was the face off between Neo and Smith. Loved it. Action Junkie here, it rules!!!!!! Niobe kicked ass too! hehe! I liked the fact that Morpheous was just human. No all knowing, all seeing general, but human. Plus i tire of his speeches, talking bores me!<br/><br/>Think I've babbled enough, don't you? One tip: This movie makes a whole lot more sense if you've seen the Animatrix. I'd recommend it to anyone. It's not as good as the 1st one but about par with Reloaded (I know loads of you didn't like it. But I did! So there!!! :P)<br/><br/>I just hope to God they don't try and make more! (Loved Star Wars, then they went and ruined it.)<br/><br/>7/10"
"michiganfan","4","0","0","13 November 2003"," Limp Ending to What Should Have Been a Great Trilogy
","I've taken 24 hours to reflect on this movie and why I was so disappointed when I left. Many folks seemed to have loved this movie because of the philosophical underpinnings. I guess the problem was that I came to be entertained. There are a few spoilers, not many though.<br/><br/>What intrigued me most about the original, and to a lesser degree the second installment, was the element of surprise. To find out that the world as we know it is a computer program - whoa. To see the characters in the Matrix, both the ""plugged"" and ""unplugged"", interact and bend the rules was very cool. In Reloaded, we learned more about the existence of ""programs"" that appeared as human. We knew that the good guys would win, but were thrilled by the freeway chase and the agent smith cloning thing.<br/><br/>As I think about great trilogies - Indiana Jones and Back to the Future are two great examples - all of the films in the series stand on their own. Even though the third installment of each series couldn't touch the first two, they were films that could be watched and enjoyed having never seen the first two. If you've seen Revolutions, ask yourself - if you had never seen the Matrix or Reloaded, would you have enjoyed or understood Revolutions? There wasn't much substance to this one outside of what you brought to it.<br/><br/>I didn't watch the Animatrix or play the Reloaded video game, which I've been told includes a lot of the back-story referenced in Revolutions. I watched a film that tried to take itself too seriously and failed to deliver the thrills that made the first two installments such a treat. I wish more time had been spent INSIDE the matrix. Characters such as the Trainman and Merovingian should have been explored more and not toppled so easily. For the fifth or sixth time I heard the Morpheous/Niobe conversation about ""everything changes and stays the same"". That was annoying in Reloaded.<br/><br/>I was expecting to see something that I'd never seen before. CGI cities and robot battles have been done a million times over. Hand-to-hand fights, whether on land or in the sky, have also been done before. The original gave us bullet time, lots of cool shots (the hand on the doorknob, eyeglass reflections, slow-mo lift explosion, bullet casing falling from the helicopter, etc.), and lots to think about. Reloaded gave us the twins, the burly brawl, the freeway chance, and a bunch of agent smiths, and the fact that this was the 6th occurrence of The One. The third gave us a little Matrix, lots of philosophical dialog, a bunch of robots that should have been able to kill everybody pretty quickly, and a happy ending that we all knew was coming.<br/><br/>Overall, I was pretty disappointed. 4/10 is my vote. Sadly, I don't even see myself buying this one when it comes out on DVD. I guess this is what happens when you give the Brothers freedom to do their thing after making 1 classic. Oh well. It was a fun ride. I hope Star Wars doesn't suffer the same fate."

","(Possible spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>Maybe there was nothing to 'get', but I didn't get it anyway. 'Revolutions' made close to no sense to me, partly because I forgot what 'Reloaded' was all about, and also partly because I was too busy laughing at the movie to attempt to follow the plot. Granted, the movie was better than I'd expected, but then again, I didn't expect much, if anything at all, in the first place. 'Reloaded' left me very, very cold and angry, and thus I thought 'Revolutions' wouldn't be much different. While the last installment is a lot better than the second, I still contend that this is a 'trilogy' that should've never be.<br/><br/>First of all, I don't think there was even a plot to follow. Ask me for the story and I couldn't tell it to you. Thanks to its two sequels, 'The Matrix', to me, is merely a 'trilogy' of visually-spectacular effects, bad acting and a whole mess of pretentiousness that I would like to have done without, thank you very much. The first movie was fantastic, the second total nonsense, the third a continuation of 'total nonsense' and since I've already forgotten what 'total nonsense' is all about and wasn't keen on sitting through 'total nonsense' again, I was clueless about 'Revolutions''s plot right from the beginning.<br/><br/>Still, any intelligent person would glean from the first few minutes that Neo is going to save the world. Or something. I didn't know what he was doing half the time, and frankly, Keanu Reeves is such a wonderful actor that he makes me NOT want to even ATTEMPT to care, sarcasm fully intended. There were a few intriguing scenes in the movie, especially the whole thing about the train, but the film-makers' solution to that problem, for lack of a better word, felt as though it was resolved too quickly. And thus, whatever interest it managed to arouse in me also quickly dissipated along with the dismissed idea that the annoying Oracle was going to lose her eyeballs (THAT would've been something!).<br/><br/>(spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>This movie also produced one of the most drawn-out, melodramatic and downright silly death scenes ever. Just how long did Trinity take to die, anyway? And I thought I'd seen enough of those in cheesy and horribly-dubbed Hong Kong flicks. I lost track of the number of times I started laughing, only to be silenced by annoyed members of the audience, but who could blame me? It was funny!<br/><br/>One thing I did like about the movie: The battle scene in Zion or whatever. It was exciting, although awfully predictable (we all know that the commander or whoever was going to die. Like, duh). This time round, the effects didn't make me laugh as much as I did during the previous movie, and that part with the water droplets was breath-taking. <br/><br/>That's about all the good things I can say about the movie. It was mildly entertaining, both intentionally and otherwise, but on the whole, it was also very silly. Keanu Reeves, in addition, is hardly a convincing superhero, so I was glad that he was left out in half the movie.<br/><br/>And can I just add that I did not get the ending? I went to see this movie to know how it all ends but I ended up not knowing anyway.<br/><br/>
Somehow, I'm not surprised at all."

","Better than Matrix II, especially the action sequences even though they are still largely senseless, but not completely. Some of the storyline presumably started in M II, but not by my memory -- Seems to just be there with a pretend origin. This was an interesting idea when it started [in M I], so it is a shame that no one knew what to do with it. It has degenerated into jibberish. One funny aspect is that the script keeps making  a big deal out of the Oracle being a different person this time around [the original actress died], where, within the reality of this movie, it wouldn't make any difference. I quess it would be too much to expect the writers and directors to have even a fundamental understanding of their own storylines. As with a lot of interesting SciFi on film, the overarching storyline drifts into fantasy, rendering much of it pointless. In a sense the writers lose the understanding of their characters, etc. The old 'sky hook' thing replaces logical cause and effect. For example, when Neo defeats Mr Smith, how does he actually do it? What signals that he has won? Wasn't the [in the coma along with Neo] other 'bad guy,' simply Mr Smith in human guise or not? And isn't he a different person than we ended M II with? Doesn't Neo kill him? OK, So what did that mean? Apparently nothing! So, why is this better than MII? Well! While the story has become psychobabble, M III attempts to have a middle and an end, even though it doesn't really have a beginning. I suspect M II, if we overlook the inconsistences between the two, serves as the beginning. Too bad that M II is a waste of time & money. It has neither a beginning nor an end and not much of a middle. One of the worst movies of the year [M II that is].<br/><br/>Hopefully, this is the end."

We do not understand how Neo separated his body from his mind. The rumor about matrix in a matrix is not true and yet Neo can blow up sentinels, a sentinel goes through Neo and what is more Neo can see in a ""mystic"" vision after he is blinded. Why did Neo meet with the architect if he had to reach him in the real world? When Neo asks the Oracle a bunch of these questions the only answer we get is that he is ""the one"".. .. These are just a few questions amongst the many that I can list. For those unanswered the plot/script was extremely disappointing. In addition the ending was too cheesy.

The story was strong, so strong that there will be no need for lingering questions-everything was answered. The fight scenes are not misplaced, as they seemed to be in `Reloaded'; each fight scene had a purpose. Neo and Trinity's love story is so key in this installment that you never view it as over the top or unnecessary. Viewers will more than receive their money's worth with the Zion battle scene but will receive an added bonus with the climatic battle between Neo and Agent Smith.

The trilogy now comes across like any other blockbusting action film - a few great sequences with impressive special effects, but with not much else to offer in the way of storyline, dialogue and performance.<br/><br/>It just feels like they should have left 'The Matrix' as it was, and not bothered with the remaining two installments.  The Wachowski Brothers seemed to be totally out of their depth in terms of the ridiculous storyline with 'Reloaded' and then got in even deeper trying to dig their way out in the final installment.  But is it really the final installment?  Seemed to me like the ending was an ending that was not completely final, and a way has been left open for even more sequels in this franchise.  Another reviewer here has said that Hollywood now no longer produces films, but franchises. That, my friends, is it in a nutshell."

","roll up roll up for the fesvtial of films that screwed a great movie series for you. Beginning in the 1930s we have ABBOT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN. Moving to the 80's we have HIGHLANDER 2 : THE QUICKENING followed by THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS. Onto 2 not classic superhero movies SUPERMAN 4 : THE QUEST FOR PEACE and BATMAN FOREVER. And before I move onto MATRIX REVOLUTIONS i'd just like to namecheck ALIEN3, THE AVENGERS and PEARL HARBOUR just for a sense of completeness. All the above movies kill the original material so dead that it is years before you re-discover an interest in them and wonder what turned you off them do much.<br/><br/>Such was the build in in RELOADED, interesting new characters, clever plot twists and great action, that is is crushing to find that in REVOLUTIONS it was actually all going NOWHERE. The new characters were just padding and the great plot twists are forgotten. The ambiguous ending? haha. The multi-dimensional dialogue and premise that had serious philosophical papers written on it vanishes in REVOLUTIONS to be replaced by PEARL HARBOUR with robots. Its mystifying actually. I thought I'd dreamed it when the credits rolled.<br/><br/>In THE MATRIX you are so involved you want to jump into the screen and fight Agent Smith yourself. In REVOLUTIONS several people I was watching with were actually rooting for Agent Smith at the end! (A lousy action sequence BTW - a climatic fight that does not come close to any of the fights in the first movie)<br/><br/>First two movies ended with pounding entirely appropriate Rage Against the Machine music over the final credits - the REVOLUTIONS does not and it would be entirely out of place if it did such is the change of tone -REMs Shiny Happy People would be more in tune. After my constant moaning about the Ewok moments at the start of RELOADED someone asked me after if it was as bad as RETURN OF THE JEDI. Well actually I think REVOLUTIONS is quite a bit worse than PHANTOM MENACE..<br/><br/>In ending I would plead with MATRIX fans to avoid REVOLUTIONS like the plague - its not an utter disaster (Monica Bellucci's t*ts are ok) but it does make everything remotely connected to it seem a lot worse.<br/><br/>On a plus note,  copies of ANIMATRIX and ENTER THE MATRIX will be v heavily discounted over the next year or so and are well worth picking up. ENTER THE MATRIX can be a bit ropy in places but also great fun and most of ANIMATRIX is pure class. Watch them instead and make your own ending up.<br/><br/>Matrix scores - Before seeing Revolutions THE MATRIX ***** ANIMATRIX **** ENTER THE MATRIX *** THE MATRIX RELOADED ****<br/><br/>After seeing Revolutions THE MATRIX **** ANIMATRIX *** ENTER THE MATRIX * THE MATRIX RELOADED **<br/><br/>Finally there is one persistant nagging doubt - one of the US reviews said ""How can something that started so cool end up so dorky?"" and it does seem v odd that something that promises so much intelligent thought can end up looking so almost willfully stupid.  I half suspected BLAIR WITCH 2 to be purposefully terrible as part of some fiendicously clever ploy to lull the audience into a false sense of security (it wasn't).<br/><br/>Here's hoping - please god - that there is a hidden clue somewhere in MATRIX REVOLUTIONS which, like the origami unicorn in BLADE RUNNER, turns the whole plot of this movie on its head and reveals the incredibly cheesy dialog and hilarious death scenes (of characters you once really cared about) to be obvious theatrical panderings to another level of Matrix inmates.."

","It is unfortunate but REVOLUTIONS fails to deliver the much anticipated goods. In fact this is the worst installment of this trilogy. Here we continue to be annoyed and obfuscated by the philosophy imbued sesquipedalian prose of the Oracle and the Frenchman. The only thing remotely interesting about the Frenchman is that his french is actually genuine. Anyway, you're completely matrixed by the plot, so you have to rely on the action for a modicum of entertainment. The attack of the machines on Zion is breathtaking, but at this point you're experiencing a computer technology laced montage, rather than watching a movie. The climatic fight of NEO against a super enhanced agent SMITH is borderline submoronic, or perhaps I'm the submoron because I couldn't quite figure out the subplot involved in this sequence. THE MATRIX was such a tour de force and indeed a breakthrough in cinematography that expectations for the sequels have been stratospheric. You have no choice but to watch REVOLUTIONS to get closure. In the end the TERMINATOR trilogy, which also involves MAN against MACHINE, is a far better movie franchise. The story is very simple, and the action is down to earth ( literally)."

","Ok, the second one had its flaws but as it filled the gap between the first and the third, I think it did a very good job! The action was intense - who still remembers the bike chase, the fight with hundreds of agents smiths and the fight with seraph?! Stunning.<br/><br/>As for the third, there were some great movie moments, i.e. gunfight with the machines and Neo's end fight with Agent Smith but there was never really any flow. The action was too start-stop. I wish they had shown more of Seraph and his excellent fighting skills....I wish keanu didn't try as hard to act. I honestly felt keanu's acting had improved in the second but seemed to put a little bit more effort into the third and that worked against him. There were some nice touches to the film like when Trinity and Neo broke through the clouds, but why didn't the daylight hurt Trinity's eyes?! Surely seeing real sunlight for the first time ever would cause them to hurt?! (Nit-picking).<br/><br/>What did surprise me was how integral agent smith was to the film. After the first he had a smallish role and it seemed like the producers thought ""Hey that agent smith guy is good, lets build the story around him?!"".<br/><br/>
In the end Agent Smiths importance overshadowed that of the machines and Neo! In a way I felt this was wrong because Neo and the machines are the main figures right?! But to be honest, Agent Smith kicks ass. I still find it funny when he says `Mister Anderson!' And he deserves to have a major role but surely not as big as it ultimately was in the end!<br/><br/>Overall, it was a satisfying film but not satisfying enough to quench my thirst for the Matrix! It is a shame it had to end here and surely a 4th would be overkill (open-ended ending?)! Maybe one day I will be able to witness another film that was as fresh and as visually stunning as the Matrix! Unfortunately not this time!"

In 'Revolutions' they fail miserably. Their strategy is to make the storyline so enigmatic and difficult to follow that their audience, many of whom are still inspired by the 'original and best', will be confused into thinking it more of the same.<br/><br/>In fact, conversely, this film has the hugely disappointing effect of debasing the original as one big, lucky accident.

Neo, Morpheus and Trinity, having recently been separated, go about their various tasks to save Zion, the last human city. During the course of the movie we meet at least a dozen, nameless, meaningless heroes, who either A.) Die heroically, or B.) Take up the call to arms after others do. These people had no point, and this movie would have been better without them. The story that the Wachowski brothers try to tell is drowned by the over reaching special effects, and horrible tailor made scenes, which in effect overpower the subtlety that I admired about the first film. In essence I did enjoy the portion of the plot surrounding Neo, but Keanu Reeves dreadful acting made it difficult to believe that he was really feeling anything, both at the loss of trinity and at the grim fate awaiting him.

I am saying that in my opinion this movie ruins the allure of the previous two.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone viewed the first Matrix with anymore than a desire to see pretty unique and serious action. What we got was even better, an action film with amazing ideas. The Matrix Reloaded went even farther offering more intense action and even more interesting questions. The Matrix Revolutions is devoid of the unique stunts that attracted us to the first two and even MORE QUESTIONS.<br/><br/>What's wrong with more questions you ask. I thought a series of films was supposed to end with some sort of finality. Maybe I just didn't get it and I'd rather think that the movie's the problem, not me. Truth is, if there's something to get, we all should have gotten it. Instead we're left to debate like politicians, seriously.<br/><br/>The action in this movie mostly centers around the machine bombardment of Zion, the last human city. Very little happens within the Matrix itself except for two scenes. One night club shoot out which makes me wonder what these characters would do if there were no columns around. Second, the final battle between Neo and Agent Smith is more reminiscent of the Dark City climax. Everything outside the Matrix gives you a been there, done that kind of feeling.<br/><br/>So is this a bad movie? Yes and no. The film quality and special effects are excellent as we all knew they would be. The script however, is extremely lacking. There are a few characters in this film that would make Ed Wood cringe. One character, whose name I can't remember is given the most god-awful lines. The whole audience is laughing but no jokes were told. This makes me question the so-called genius known as the Wachowski Brothers.<br/><br/>Understand that I say these things as a huge fan of the first two movies. It perplexes me how two movies shot simultaneously (Reloaded & Revolutions) can be so different.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you liked Deep Rising, you'll probably enjoy The Matrix Revolutions.

","This actually was a decent movie. Yea, this review is completely opposite of my review of Reloaded, but that was upon one viewing of Reloaded. Since that first viewing, I saw it once again on IMAX and another time in a regular theater, and actually enjoyed it. I bought 'Enter the Matrix' and beat that as well, getting all the little snippets that connect the game and Reloaded with Revolutions. Then I bought Reloaded and watched it for nearly 2 weeks straight before Revolutions came out. By the way, seeing Revolutions on IMAX is an experience that no one should miss.<br/><br/>Spoilers...<br/><br/>Onto Revolutions...and as I said, it is decent. There are few movies that put me on the edge of my seat, and this one actually did. The Club Hell fight sequence was interesting, and got better once The Merovingian was brought back to the screen. Lambert Wilson was a riot, and Monica Belluci takes her vitamins. The Duel between Bane and Neo wasn't very good, especially the mutilation of Neo's eyes. That had some point (Neo being able to see the energy of the machines) but it really wasn't more than a nod to Dune Messiah. The Battle for Zion was a tense scene that was amazing if you ask me. It alone was worth the price of the IMAX ticket. The blend of CG and live-action was phenomenal, and Captain Mufine should win ""The Ultimate Bad@$$ of the Year"" Award. The Death of Trinity was overly long and sappy to the ultimate end. I really didn't feel anything for Trinity's death. The Final Duel between Smith and Neo was fantastic. I felt like a little kid reading a Superman comic. The new Oracle was not Gloria Foster, but good nonetheless. And the reappearance of the Architect was great for a smile, though I wanted him to say 'ergo' and 'concordantly' once more.<br/><br/>If you didn't play 'Enter the Matrix' then the introduction of Sati was probably confusing. In the game, the Oracle speaks of a child who will save the Matrix. Sati is that child, though I really don't see how she saved the Matrix.<br/><br/>The idea that Neo and Smith are exact opposites is a wonderful idea and I thought it was portrayed perfectly on Smith's side and stonerly by Neo. But that's what you get for casting Keanu Reeves... I think Guy Pearce would've been a better choice, or at least someone who does have a brain. Hugo Weaving is an absolutely brilliant choice for Agent Smith, and he should be recognized as one of the all-time baddest villains. At least within the top five, but not the top.<br/><br/>The music is great, even the techno-ish stuff. The instrumental music is where its at though.<br/><br/>The SFX are great, even if you can easily tell what's real and what isn't.<br/><br/>
Now I'm out of words to say. Go see it in IMAX. That is the only way you can really give the movie any justice. (And the source's voice shakes the entire theater like a really close lightning bolt's thunder).<br/><br/>

That being stated, Revolutions is the most perfect ending to the Matrix trilogy.  Not only did it explain so much, but the extremely intense emotion and realization received by Neo and the audience is so great that not many external sources can create such profound feelings within an audience.  The only problem with this is that not everyone can experience the full affect of the phenomenon of the Matrix trilogy.  Just as there is only point one percent of people within the matrix that believe they have a choice and do not simply accept the matrix, there is sadly only point one percent of people who can truly understand and acquire the eminence of the trilogy.  This is unfortunate, but I have discussed this fact with some of my colleagues and even those who disgrace the films agree that my point is quite valid indeed.  Either those unfortunate 99.9 percent of people do cannot grasp and therefore cannot absolutely comprehend the substance of the final ending of the trilogy, or they simply are not competent enough to cherish and value the feeling of wholeness that should be apparent.  I know this is distressing, but do not let it shun you away from seeing Revolutions.  Everyone should see it because you never know if you are one of the point one percent until you see the movie.  Everyone should see this movie, after seeing the first two Matrix movies, because it is such an amazing conclusion to such a momentous somewhat epic tale.

Agent Smith is as always very articulate and vicious. I found the Reloaded a little cryptic and abstruse, especially, the long discussion between the Creator and Neo. However, Revolutions is easier to follow and many action sequences and locations are a deja vu to the first Matrix. I thought the chant as the credits begin to roll at the end to be very appropriate.

I have Matrix, Revisited & Reloaded on DVD, bought and played ""Enter the Matrix"" Video game and watched the Animatrix hundreds of times over, after all of this expenditure and anticipation for ""Revolutions"" I feel that I have been totally dupped by the Brothers and WB / Village Roadshow.<br/><br/>The only way to accuratley describe ""Revolutions"" without spoiling it for anyone, is to equate it to Back to the Future 3 (The first film to be made back to back with BTTF2). Remember the first BTTF, how kewl it was and how it got us all interested in Time travel and the characters of Marty, Doc, Biff and Marty's parents. Then they announced they were to make BTTF 2 & 3 with a cliffhanger at the end of 2. I remember coming out of the cinema after BTTF2 amazed at what had been achieved and where they took the story (as I did with Reloaded after expecting ""Matrix Squad"" as a sequel). Then when BTTF3 was released I couldn't wait to see how they were going to expand on the premisses they had set up in Part 2 and conclude the series. The dissapointment I felt after watching BTTF3 can only be equated to how I felt when I walked out of Matrix Revolutions. It is as if the brothers spent all the budget they had for both movies on Reloaded and then slapped Revolutions together to meet the deadline they (and the Studio) had set themselves and the fact that they knew everyone would go to see it regardless as they had to see the conclusion.<br/><br/>Revolutions feels as if there is 30 mins of extra footage missing (or that this movie was a decoy and the ""real"" conclusion to Matrix is yet to come). It is obvious that whatever budget was left to conclude the series was used on CG Effects for the battle of Zion.....the actors look and sound tired, the story seems weak, the ending is almost corney and apart from the blatant Christian propaganda, the painfully obvious opening for for further sequels is just a sad inditment on the state of the Hollywood Movie Machine that no longer makes Motion Pictures, just money making franchises.......<br/><br/>

That film was almost saved by one spectacular and inventive car chase.  The Matrix Revulsion has no such redemption.<br/><br/>The story is really poor.  I get the impression that the W brothers had one great idea and managed to turn it into a fantastic movie, but were totally unable to reproduce this form again.<br/><br/>Neo lurches through the entire film either not knowing or being sure what he has to do.  At no point do we see the process that he goes through to get from the former to the later.  The Oracle seems to operate entirely on this basis, telling everyone that when the time comes they will know what must be done.  This advice seems to me so open ended and ambiguous that it must call into question her use as an Oracle.<br/><br/>The battle for Zion, while interesting, goes on way too long, and from the moment the irritating sycophantic kid appears in the dock its obvious that he will save the day.  That part of the film was totally pointless as far as I could see.<br/><br/>The whole Agent Smith thing was stupid and the final battle between him and Neo ridiculous and over done.<br/><br/>I think I, like most people, hoped that this film would answer many of the questions raised in Reloaded.  Instead, all it does is present more.<br/><br/>What is the Merovingian?<br/><br/>Why cant the machines just build a very tall tower an put solar panels on it, thus removing the need for people?<br/><br/>What *is* Neo?<br/><br/>Why can Neo now move in and out of the matrix without being jacked in?<br/><br/>Why did invincible Agent Smith suddenly loose the plot right at the end, seemingly without any good reason?<br/><br/>Why didn't the machines let Neo defeat Smith and then wipe out Zion anyway?<br/><br/>I can't believe people are asking the question about a sequel.

If you like action, gloriously choreographed fight sequences and the confusion of the what ifs, then you will love this film. Loose ends are not tied, and is peace closure. Is it really peace at all? Were you really watching this film and are you really reading this review...<br/><br/>To sum it up. This film is so far my favourite of the year. The acting may be slightly wooden, and the love between Neo and Trinity does not really makes us feel very passionate. The dialogue in places appears over written and very Capraesque, but who cares? The Matrix is clever, and inspiring. I love it"
"hintzeg","Null","0","0","11 November 2003"," The Final Chapter
","Everything that has a beginning has an end. The tagline adequately describes the closing chapter of the Matrix trilogy. It seems, unfortunately, that the spectacle has left it's philosophically demanding plotlines behind in favor of really cool explosions.<br/><br/>Now don't misinterpret; the Wachowski brothers continue to push visual effects to the limit and beyond. Bullet time was the original brilliance, and they follow it beautifully in Revolutions. The battle for the human city of Zion was a special effects smorgasbord, both visually beautiful and realistically frightening. I sat with my mouth agape, stunned by the realism of the invading machines. It's pretty safe to say that we will not see a film with such gorgeous and well produced special effects for the next ten years.<br/><br/>The story, however, lags behind the impressive visual display. We again catch up with the usual cast of characters; Morpheus, Neo, Trinity and the many Agent Smiths, right where they left off in Reloaded. The first hour of the film is a bit slow, a little bit of catching up and a lot of dialogue. The action picks up as Bane, the crewmember who now is inhabited by Agent Smith, plots his attack. A tremendous fight between Neo and Bane picks up the pace and kicks the action into high gear.<br/><br/>Notice a pattern, though? Boring dialogue and sluggish plot lines dive into incredible action and special effects sequences. The first Matrix, however fantastic the action and effects were, was so good because of the dialogue and the premise behind the film. The sequels seem to be advancing the story in a direction with which they could use the most innovative effects technology.<br/><br/>Though the sequels don't live up to the expectations set by the original, that's far from saying they are bad movies. Compared to most of the garbage movie studios put out each Friday, I'd much rather see Matrix Revolutions. The story, while lackluster in comparison to the first, has elements everyone can relate to; love, fear, fate and the fight against oppression.<br/><br/>
Most importantly, however, the story does bring closure to the trilogy. The Wachowski brothers are certainly not afraid to kill off some of their famed characters (in order to know who, you'll have to watch the movie) or to give the viewer a conclusion to the war that was certainly unexpected by most voracious fans.<br/><br/>I do wonder, however, if they set themselves up for yet another possible sequel. As conclusive as the ending was, there was enough ambiguity to be able to tie in another film. Go see this movie, and when you do, pay attention to the Oracle's last lines, and wonder to yourself if Matrix Resurrections is going to be next on the list."

","Revolutions isn't the film it should've been. Characters don't quite engage the way they might, the story doesn't thrill and enthrall as it should. Yet it still manages to be enjoyable- action sequences are well directed, particularly the central battle in the real world, which combines war movie cliche with jaw-dropping scale and scope with breathtaking effect.<br/><br/>
How well you enjoy the rest of the movie depends on how much you enjoy Smith's snarkiness and feel for the leads- while I found it amusing, melancholy and uplifting in turns, if you were annoyed by Reloaded you'll be ready to strangle the Watchowski brothers by the finale. An affinity for Don Davis' score is a plus; giving yourself over to the emotions the (relatively tonal) music weaves improves the film immeasurably."

For Revolutions I tried (successfully) to not hear anything about it before seeing it, so I would be completely pure and able to think about it without any outside influence...<br/><br/>I saw it, and now I feel as if something beautiful has been viciously ripped from within me; as if I've just been cheated.  I feel embarrassed for spending money on this movie, and I feel absolutely let down.<br/><br/>There was so much cheese.  I'll admit the Matrix movies were always filled with cheesy lines and laughable dialogue...but Revolutions took it to another level altogether by making some plot elements as cheesy as the dialogue (*cough* Sati).<br/><br/>the ""Train Man"" ?!?

That's understandable considering peoples high expectations of the film so I'm not terribly surprised with the score, however, I feel that the general public have not taken into consideration the relationship of this film and anime films.<br/><br/>I think they did an excellent job in matching the style, tempo, and cinematography of this film with anime classics such as ""The Ghost in the Shell"", ""Akira"", & ""Jin-Ron"".<br/><br/>From a technical perspective, outside of content, the film rates very well.<br/><br/>Consider watching some anime if you are a Matrix fan.

","When the original was released, it was hailed in many quarters as a masterpiece. It was certainly original, and used foundation of many concepts of philosophy as its plot base. However, the ending was a bit of an anti-climax really, and a few questions remain unanswered. Reloaded overdid the cheese element, made the plot totally baffling, but featured a thrilling freeway scene. So now it is left to Revolutions to tie up all the loose ends and conclude the story. Right? Nah, not really. It doesn't answer much at all, and ultimately isn't a conclusion, but is still a decent enough movie. Many are taking it way too seriously - yes, as a climax it's anti-climatical, and a bit shallow, but it's still a good enough ride and will entertain you.

"modius","Null","0","0","14 November 2003"," Not sure what to make of this 'revolution'
","I'm not sure what to make of Matrix Revolutions. Sure I agree with the people that it isn't as intelligent, thoughtful or as laid out as the original, sure it lacks the venom or fear in the fight sequences - and somehow the CGI doesn't seem to add to the film anymore.<br/><br/>So what's it missing?  I personally think its lacking a real threat, we already know Neo is the one and can bend the rules of the matrix world - so we don't fear his downfall because we know he'll eventually rise up.<br/><br/>Take for example when Neo, in the first Matrix film, walks onto a ledge on a high-rise building - the shot of him looking down and you see the drop was intelligent - but the other films seemed to be more lazy in their manner - going for the quick buck rather the hard sell.<br/><br/>Everyone agrees that the first Matrix film was very good - I didn't at the time - I called a mess, but it has grown on me - it has taken an old philosophical puzzle and turned it on its head.  <br/><br/>The second film went deeper into the puzzle but ruined itself with constant long scenes that didn't seem to go anywhere and it made mistakes by allowing everyone in the 'real world' to do all the special skills that Neo had - which diminished the threat of the Agents.<br/><br/>This film throws away almost all references to the second film and slaps back straight into the action. <br/><br/>There's plenty of action revolving the invasion of Zion and most of it is enjoyable, but there are questions revolving the use of EMP and their lack of basic military tactics.<br/><br/>Aside from the attack on Zion, the movie revolves around the constant themes of religion - one actor speaks of the role of karma as being he's soul's duty to perform - however this is a mistake - what he was really referring to was Dharama.<br/><br/>Anyway - this theme is rallied home when Neo decides to take on Smith in the final reels of the film and sacrifices himself to save all humans and give peace in the ongoing war against man and machine.<br/><br/>I didn't like the fight between Neo and Smith - I was expecting an extremly hard, fast almost hyperkenetic fight that would rival the very best kung fu movies from Hong Kong - instead we get a fly-by-wire fight that rivals Superman II.<br/><br/>Finally I was puzzled by Neo's final realisation of the 'truth' - he must cause mass genocide (ie: kill everyone in the matrix) to save everybody in the real world.  Was this really ""adventures of anti virus"", or something more?<br/><br/>I feel that this movie involved me in the fight in Zion, but not in the fight against Smith - it didn't involve or excite me with its characters (Neo was just plain boring and Trinity didn't really do anything). Which is a shame, considering the 'pedigree' of its original.<br/><br/>Overall: 5/10."

","The only reason I've started writing reviews in the first place was that I wanted to see how good I was in writing essays and since I really like movies the selection of IMDb as my tribune of choice came quite naturally. This, to my modest opinion, is the best site on movie reviews. And now I am here in from of my computer trying to write something about the final sequel of a trilogy that caused probably the biggest excitement in the movie world since the Star Wars trilogy. I don't remember experiencing something as ... indescribable as the moment in the first Matrix when Neo took the red pill. The following 10 minutes or so were moviemaking at its greatest (the closest emotional experience that I can remember were the last 10-15 minutes of the movie ""Vanilla Sky""-in a different way though).<br/><br/>Then came the second Matrix, which was quite a disappointment to me. When I think back again I realize that the first Matrix raised the bar to the highest possible level, which didn't allow for such a short period to come up with a sequel that would live up to the origin. And again, the mistake with the second one was entirely mine-I shouldn't have watched the movie more than once. <br/><br/>And now comes the great finale. As I (we all I believe) have set about watching this one with much, much lower expectations, not really caring much about Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and the rest of the gang, just simply waiting for the grand finale, I have to say I was completely contented, maybe not on 100% but nevertheless, satisfied enough. <br/><br/>If the first Matrix was an absolute 10, the second was below 7, the third one is closer to 8."
"sthapns247","9","0","0","13 November 2003"," The Ultimate Battle Between Good and Evil
","""The Matrix Revolutions"" was everything anyone could want out of a conclusion and maybe more.<br/><br/>**CONTAINS SPOILERS**<br/><br/>While it had its problems, (Personally, the Agent Smith clone in the real world was unneeded to a vast extent, but oh well.) it also succeeded on more levels than I could have imagined it would.  Sure, I've only seen it once, but I feel once is enough to write a favorable review for a very superior movie.  The Wachowski brothers have taken the audience from a real fake world where everything is created to control to a war in which the entire human race's fate depends.  If you think you can do this while putting in all the faith, religion, action, and personal emotion they have you can kiss my a$$ because it's almost impossible.  And because it is nearly impossible a few rough spots and problems are expected and easily over looked.<br/><br/>""Revolutions"" is more of a war movie that anything.  While it was the technical explanations, religious references, and faith based choices that made the entire series so different, the attack on Zion and the battle that occurred was the heart of the film and was an absolutely stunning sight. Swarms of sentinels moving in huge, organized pods only to be eliminated by bastions of human looking robots all taking place in the surrealistic environment known as Zion is really a breath taking sight.  While it could have obviously been longer, what was there was beautiful and well done.  The personal hero aspect of war was also done well here and fit in nicely with the pinnacle hero theme that has come to be the only linking string between all the stories going on in the Matrix universe.<br/><br/>Just like ""Reloaded,"" Neo is not really the main focus of the film; the people stuck in Zion fighting off the machines takes the forefront here. These are characters that were introduced in ""Reloaded,"" but never really expanded upon and any scene with Morpheus in it is always good.  The feeling of how small the people are compared to the machines is really showcased by the way they have to destroy the drill machines and how there are like 15 sentinels for every human.  The Zion battle scene was executed flawlessly and the minor characters that were brought the fore front was a nice touch to show that everyone was fighting their own personal battle as well as the major one.<br/><br/>Aside from the Zion battle, the rest of the movie exists to explain why the ending worked and why it ended the way it did.  The existence of another place between the real world and the Matrix is also intriguing, but sadly the Merovingian is not used as much as he should be, but they had to put a lot into this movie so this is understandable.  To fully understand the ending I will need to watch the movie more times, but I felt that the ending fit the trilogy and did not feel cheated nor rewarded.<br/><br/>To fully understand ""Revolutions"" you have to look at the name.  The word it plural, so that means there are more than just one revolution, or change, on the movie.  Obviously, the freeing of the Matrix was the biggest one, but there were many more that I cannot get into because of the room I have.<br/><br/>The entire series boils down to this: The ultimate battle between good and evil.  While in modern day this would be if Jesus Christ manifested himself to battle Satan who also manifested himself.  In the Matrix it is Neo (Christ) who enters the Matrix one last time to battle Smith (Satan) to the death... And to the death he fights.  While the final battle was very short and not that spectacular, perhaps this was more symbolism in how the final battle between our personal good and evils is or will be relatively short. Either way, the ending was satisfying and was the most logical for the series.<br/><br/>This is definitely a trilogy that will stand strong for years to come and gain power as it ages.  ""The Matrix"" is the premiere episode that started it all and set the scene. ""Reloaded"" expanded the Matrix and, in time, may be seen as the better movie and ""Revolutions"" ended what obviously needed an end...

It is a wonderful story about two diametrically opposed computer viruses- one is Neo, the other is, of course, Agent Smith.  Neo inadvertantly created the Agent Smith virus at the end of the first movie.<br/><br/>Revolutions pulls many of the loose ends together and paints a compelling picture of what exactly is the machine's motivation.

That was the Matrix trilogy hitting a giant brick wall.<br/><br/>I don't want to say that the latest the last installment, Revolutions, is bad, but I hear dentists recently rejected the idea of the movie playing in their waiting rooms because they felt it would drive away their patients.<br/><br/>Revolutions isn't mind-numbingly awful, though. It's a laugh riot. The trouble is, the Wachowski brothers (who cowrote and codirected) forgot to add any jokes.<br/><br/>When last we left our intrepid, patchwork band of rebels fighting those evil machines that run the Matrix, Neo (Keanu Reeves) was somewhere between the machine world and the real world. Oh, and some guy who apparently was sent to kill him was in a coma.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the machines are drilling down to the last outpost of real humanity, the deep-underground city known as Zion, where people have come from all cultures (and, judging from the look of their executive council, all hairstyles as well), people who simultaneously raise their hands either to express defiance or because they're testing a new underarm deodorant. You know these people. They're dirty and yet so pure.<br/><br/>It's up to Neo, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to figure out how to stop the machines, who are led by Sentinels, mosquito-like drones that you just can't swat. Aiding them in their quest is The Oracle, the mystical - if slightly dowdy - psychic played by Mary Alice. Like most of the people in the movie, The Oracle speaks in riddles. But don't worry about understanding her cryptic responses - there's killin' to be done!<br/><br/>And what killing! One scene - the attack of Zion by the machines - takes forever. (I didn't have a watch in the cold, cold theater, but I could have read it by the bright green EXIT sign behind me. A sign that, by the way, looked awfully inviting.) It seems like an entire hour of the two-hour movie is devoted to these things breaking through the outer hull of the underground city and kicking butt. The trouble is, the action moves soquick, it's often tough for the normal human eye to discern who is shooting at whom. It's just madness, utter chaos without any sort of perspective. In short, it's an absolute mess.<br/><br/>(One of the weapons the humans use in their defense are these giant Transformers-like robots into which the human straps himself - males only; sorry, ladies! - and maneuvers the arms to fire machine guns. But what's the point? The humans themselves are completely vulnerable - they don't even warrant a plastic shield!)<br/><br/>In this movie, we see a few familiar characters from the first two movies. There seems to be no need for them - except for The Oracle - other than to complicate the plot. Which is quite odd, because the entire plot itself takes only 30 minutes or so to play out - the rest is sound and fury.<br/><br/>Some of the dialog - no, make that most - is astoundingly poor. Take that lengthy battle scene, for instance. It's as if the Wachowskis were channeling a screenwriter from old Republic Pictures, the low-budget outfit that produced scads of John Wayne war movies. Nearly every cliche shows up in this one, from the goofy young soldier who screws up but just somehow manages to help save the day to the two soldiers on the run from the machine, with one mowed down while the other just escapes. (I expected a ""no.. go on.. beat those machines!"" before the soldier died.)<br/><br/>Here's how it breaks down, folks. The first Matrix was wonderful in its mysticism; it was more than bombs burstin' in the air. It was philosophical and quite mysterious. The second one lost a bit of that but still tossed a few curveballs our way.<br/><br/>But the third one? Try no mysticism and some of the poorest action scenes in recorded history."

How many slow-mo's and cgi crap can you cram into a small space? 4) Just because it looks cool doesn't mean it IS cool 5) No characters were likeable 6) In a high-tech world where machines and programs run everything, do we have to resort to hand-to-hand combat?  Where is the intelligence? 7) Why is there always a RAVE party in the future? (Of course it has to include topless Girls Gone Wild too) 8) Why does every building where there is a gun fight have convenient columns and walls to do acrobatics off of? 9) Which cliche were they trying to mask in the cgi ""Love conquers all"" ""Mind or Muscle"" or ""The Little Engine that Could""? 10) Looked like a glorified playstation game but played with much less substance<br/><br/>Sorry folks who thought it had some deeper meaning or social significance. It didn't, other than sucking away your hard earned money to feed the Hollywood machine."

","To fully understand the Matrix saga, you should also watch The Animatrix and play the video game.

People complain about the ending, but honestly, many don't want to accept the fact that there is an ending. The ending explained things from the first movie, and was a good continuation from Reloaded. It has some amazing cinematography and, once again, Smith pulls it off as one of the coolest, bad guys. Is there an Oscar category for that? The entire trilogy has set a bar so high, it will be years before something else compares.<br/><br/>Hopefully, there will be a 3 DVD set with some behind the scenes stuff and interviews.

"thomrockwell-1","Null","0","0","9 November 2003"," Could this movie have possibly been any worse?
","This movie was absolutely horrible, that it is difficult to know where to begin. First, let me say that I loved the first two. They are two of my favorite movies. So I am not writing this review as a person who doesn't like (or doesn't understand) the Matrix, but rather as a fan and appreciator of the Wachowski Brothers particular brand of fiction, who could not have been more let down by this film.<br/><br/>This movie was so uninteresting that I was tempted to get up and walk out, but I was still curious if they were going to actually find a conclusive end to their story. Which they did not.<br/><br/>A particular point of contention for me (aside from the lack a decent story and the complete lack of philosophical dialogue that made the first two so unique) was that they all but abandoned the story material and characters that had been set up so eloquently in the first two films. In Revolutions, we were subtly led to believe that the `real world' was but another layer of the Matrix. The brothers didn't seem to know where to go with this, and chose instead to allude to it a bit more, but never truly resolve it. A complete and utter let down.<br/><br/>They also abandoned many of the new characters that were introduced in the second film. The beautiful and unpredictable Persephone, who could have provided a key part in the third installment as a double agent, was only in one scene (and if I recall, she didn't even have any dialogue). The character of the Merovingian, who should have been a major player in the finale, is only in one scene, and not a very good one. In Reloaded, we became aware of the Vampires, Werewolves, Ghosts and Aliens. None of whom are anywhere to be found in this film. It would have made for a lot of compelling conflict if they were thrown into the mix. And what about the counselor character from Zion who we met in the second film. Was he even in this one? If he was, his part must have been very small. He could have been set up as a character that played a great role in the revolution at Zion. Another great supporting character who was left in the dust.<br/><br/>
The Zion battle was must have been 45 minutes at least, but it felt painfully like six days. They were shooting at the sentinels. And then more sentinels came. And then more shooting. And then more sentinels. Ugh! Enough already, get on with the story, if there is one.<br/><br/>And last but not least the cheesy Wizard of Oz send up at the end was as bad as the talking `God' head in the end of the 5th Star Trek movie. If the Wachowski Brothers needed help writing a decent screenplay, I wish they would have called me. I would have loved to have been afforded the opportunity to help them resolve such wonderful plotlines, with such a rich array of characters and situations. Instead, we are left with something that is as bad and difficult to watch as that Superman movie with Richard Pryer. Actually, compared to this movie, that Superman flick doesn't seem so bad."

","The Matrix Revolutions should have been the best of the Matrix films. Sadly,it's a disappointment and probably the weakest. The film is actually hard to watch in parts because of it's awful dialogue. The action is mostly limited to a lengthy battle between the machines and the humans and the final Neo/Agent Smith duel. Both are undoubtedly exciting but there is nothing to match the car chase of Matrix Reloaded.<br/><br/>Even more the other two films,the filmmakers seem intent on complicating the plot unnecessarily. Of course there is nothing wrong with complex,twist-filled plots in sci-fi movies,but one gets the feeling even the Warchowski's don't really know what is going on. We deserved,at least at the end,some answers,and few were provided. Even more sadly,I didn't really care. The Warchowski's are so bothered with creating conundrums and clever computer effects that they forget to even give us characters we care about. Unlike say,The Lord Of The Rings,where despite all the spectacle and fantasy you still have characters who have genuine emotions and who you become concerned about. Here,when a lead character dies,we are not moved at all. Keanu Reeves is so wooden that you could make a barn out of him. Monica Bellucci,as usual,is wasted.<br/><br/>Not really a bad film,the visuals are,as expected,terrific,but we really deserved more."

","With all the negative reviews that are circulating at the moment, I went into this movie very tentatively. Good thing I did, because I enjoyed it.

Mind you, I am comparing it with an ending that I had read about, which to me was p*** weak. An absolute cop out.<br/><br/>Where this movie did succeed however, where Reloaded did not, was that it was not more of the same. Reloaded had choreographed fight scene after choreographed fight scene, in other words, they all looked to rehearsed. This one had only one such scene and that was at the end, the rest looked a lot fresher.<br/><br/>While not a great sequel by any stretch, it was a reasonably fitting ending to what ""WAS"" a fresh approach to action movies."

"d-cavallaro","Null","0","0","11 November 2003"," An imaginatively apt final instalment.
","N.B.: POTENTIAL SPOILERS<br/><br/> Philosophically, Revolutions works on the premises laid out in the first two instalments, answering some of the questions they raised and leaving others deliberately unanswered, which is consonant with the trilogy's postmodern outlook. What the third film proposes is that for the world to continue at all, both humans and machines must go on. By annihilating Agent Smith at the cost of his own life, Neo enables the temporary continuation of both species. The salvation of Zion suggests that unplugged humans may indeed manage to survive. Yet, the continuation of the human race epends no less crucially on the perpetuation of the Matrix, for the majority of people simply could not endure outside the simulation and its ephemeral rewards. Thus, whilst rounding off the narrative by confirming Neo's prophesied role, the movie makes it quite clear that the resolution is far from conclusive: the Matrix itself cannot - must not - be annihilated, and this entails the ongoing possibility of imbalances and anomalies corrupting the system.<br/><br/> It is also crucial to remember, in this regard, that Agent Smith is neither a human being nor a machine but rather Neo's negative computational alter ego - the Zero to Neo's One. Indeed, the characters' roles are perhaps best understood with reference to the digital computer's disarmingly simple binary logic (a logic which informs the Matrix narrative right from the point at which Morpheus asks Neo to choose between the red and the blue pills in the first movie). The usefulness of approaching the characters in this way, rather than on the basis of a humanistic model, is attested to by the `Superbrawl'. Clearly, it is not out of sporting fairness that Smith chooses to fight Neo single-handedly and consigns his billions of clones to the status of passive onlookers.<br/><br/> In fact, the final showdown - a far more decisive chapter in the series than the cartoonishly euphoric `Burly Brawl' presented in Reloaded - must be played out in accordance with the rules of the simulation in which it occurs and, ultimately, the only value that truly obtains in a digitized environment is the confrontation of 0 and> 1.<br/><br/> The final instalment of the trilogy is a logical corollary of the situations mapped out by its predecessors. It supplies a denouement congruous with what has gone before but steers clear of definitive endings: the peace is a precarious accomplishment, and the fairytale element permeating the climaxes of the first and the second films is peremptorily denied, as the main characters responsible for the achievement of that peace will emphatically not be there to enjoy it. If Reloaded introduced Eros to the Matrix universe, Revolutions could be said to dramatize the inextricability of Eros from Thanatos.<br/><br/> Technologically, the third film fully confirms the trilogy's revolutionary contribution to film-making through the deployment of virtual cinematography. As the boundaries of the cinematically feasible are innovatively stretched, the very status of reality in a culture, such as ours, that is increasingly steeped in digital technology is simultaneously called into question. Like its predecessors, Revolutions suggests that in constructing complex visions by recourse to digital technology, cinema is capable of questioning the reality level of the world outside the auditorium.<br/><br/> The instability of the parameters of the real is emphasized, in Revolutions, by the ideation of virtual locations not seen in the prequels - most notably: the Carrollian `limbo' between the Matrix and the Machine City in which Neo finds himself trapped at the beginning of the film; the Escheresquely fabulous Machine City itself, to which Neo and Trinity travel and where the hero makes a pact with the machines; and the Merovingian's strobe-washed bondage nightclub, 'Hell'. > The third movie concurrently elaborates the growing convergence of cinema and videogames, especially in the Siege sequence, whereby the distance between the two media is rapidly shrinking in favour of a novel form of technoludism. Some commentators have argued that in deliberately adopting a visual style derived from the register of computer games, the final instalment's main sequences damage the ability to suspend disbelief. However, it could be argued that what the Wachowskis sought to encourage right from the start was not the suspension of disbelief but the suspension of the suspension of disbelief. This is attested to not only by the employment of videogame-inspired techniques but also by the incorporation of the highly stylized visual languages of comic books, graphic novels, manga and animÃ©.<br/><br/> The ending of the trilogy will certainly give rise to many theories and speculations amongst zealous Matrix fans, even if for a number of viewers Revolutions has not turned out to be quite what they expected it to be (whatever that was) prior to its simultaneous worldwide release on 5 November 2003. Perhaps, the people who are most likely to enjoy the film are those who are prepared to leave their expectations at home, and to approach it not as if it were a standalone movie but as part of a bigger picture - which is precisely what it is.<br/><br/> It is also noteworthy, for the record, that when Reloaded was unleashed, back in May 2003, it was branded by several journalists as a `disappointment', yet this statement was soon disproved by both the movie's reviews and its box-office grossing.<br/><br/> Those who have found Revolutions `disappointing' may to some extent be repeating an established trend. Moreover, critics that object to the inclusion of philosophical ruminations in both sequels would plausibly have derided the films as mindless pulp had they not contained those scenes; concurrently, critics that dislike the large-scale action sequences might have abhorred a weightier emphasis on the moments of speculation and self-reflection. The art of criticism rests on an ancient dictum: `heads I win; tails you lose.'<br/><br/> Ultimately, it is the coalescence of unprecedentedly slick action pieces and apparently lofty yet also tongue-in-cheek philosophical perorations that gives the trilogy its distinctive visual and conceptual identity - and all three films contribute in their own different ways to this accomplishment."

","I just Matrix Revolutions today for the second time. I admit that the first time, I agreed with a lot of people and I too said the movie was boring, pointless and featured A LOT of uninspired dialogue. ""Neo... I believe"" and such. However, I went to see it again today and I loved it. The difference this time around? I watched Matrix 1 and 2 right before I went to see it. I recommend this to anyone before going to see Revolutions. It's completely clear to me now that Larry and Andy planned these movies exactly the way they appear onscreen. Unfortunately I was unable to see the footage for Enter the Matrix, but that game explains so much, it's almost criminal to force people to play a mediocre game to get at that aspect of the story. The story- which is brilliant in my opinion. There are two reasons I think most people don't really like Revolutions. 1- it does not stand on its own at all. Reloaded and Revolutions are pretty much one movie. Period. You need to see Reloaded right before Revolutions. It's as simple as that. 2- Revolutions goes against traditional American fare. It is very inspired by Japanese culture and anime, and because of that it does not have a traditional American ending. It does not hand us all the answers on a silver platter. It expects us to put some of the story elements together on our own. It expects more of its audience that most movies. But any question you have can be answered. Why did the architect say what he said in part 2? Answer's there. Why was this time different that the other ""The One""s encountered? Answer's there. I urge everyone who goes to see this movie to see Reloaded first. I wish movie theaters would just play them back to back. Bane's story is fascinating. Smith is enthralling. The Oracle is simply genius. I love these three movies and they represent to me the very essence of why sequals should be made for some movies. This is what people should try to do with movies. This is why movies are different from any other form of story telling. This IS movie-making."
"TheMovieExpert","Null","0","0","11 November 2003"," Finally, an intelligent review.
","After all the childish ranting and raving from the various amateur so-called ""critics"", I have decided that I should offer a more intelligent review of ""The Matrix Revolution"". Fortunately, the intelligencia here at IMDB will tell you that I am probably the most advanced film critic, so I strongly advise you to pay attention closely.<br/><br/>First off, I would like to say the visual effects in this film were first-rate. To give you an idea of just how remarkable they are, not even I could offer any advice on how to improve them, although given a little time I'm sure I could make numerous improvements. However, it is quite clear to most right-thinking individuals that the film-makers have been reading my suggestions and penetrating insight on other heavily effects-laden films, and their work is all the better for it. As an aside, I strongly recommend that those of you interested in special effects learn something about computers - they are being used more and more for this purpose, and need to be instructed in a language called ""visual basic"".<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the script. If the Wachowski brothers should happen to read this, they should understand that my services are available for both script review and development, and it needn't be particularly expensive, especially if I get a cut of the gross. Personally I also felt the film was a little long (two hours and ten minutes). I strongly urge the filmmakers to pay close attention to me before making their next film. The dialogue was stilted and self important. Even the young people wearing baseball caps in the cinema could tell they were being treated with utter condescension and would say so if they had a vocabulary as extensive as mine.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, I'm sure you'd agree with me that everybody involved with this film ""must try harder"". I've seen worse films for sure, but the makers hadn't consulted me beforehand. Normally I'd give a film like this a six or a seven, but I note that its current average is 6.5, so I voted it a ""1"" to bring it down a little."

"The_Experiment_In_Terror","Null","0","0","9 November 2003"," A Satisfactory, However Disappointing Ending to the Trilogy
","The first time I saw 'The Matrix', it left me with nothing but respect for the Wachowski Brothers for their rather ambitious project that could have gone wrong in so many ways. The 1st film was great, but the 2nd and 3rd films were not so great.<br/><br/>I will say that in Revolutions they seem to have taken a page out of X-Men 2 where they had integrated several simultaneously running plot lines to bounce back and forth between, to maintain audience interest. Furthermore the fact that this film was not so focused on the romance/love between Neo and Trinity was another asset to Revolutions. I will always stand by this opinion and that is there nothing wrong with having a lover/love interest, but Reloaded really did trip because it was so heavily focused on the relationship between Neo and Trinity when, in relation to the rest of the story i.e. Humans vs. the Machines, such an exercise seemed rather pointless.<br/><br/>Reeves and the other actors did exceptionally well given what they had to work with, however, compared to Reloaded, the dialogue is much better in Revolutions. There were quite a few great moments in the film i.e. the Night Club sequence, the Oracle/Agent Smith sequence, the piloting of the Mechanical Line sequence and virtually all of the battle sequences. The final battle sequence between Neo and Agent Smith seemed a little labored at certain points (i.e. when they are locked together beating each other up in mid-air) however I did like how the battle between the two characters was ended, it seemed rather clever (if not being a slight rehash from final battle between Neo and Agent Smith in the 1st installment of the Matrix Series). The first two thirds of the film were quite good it just really trips at the finish line.<br/><br/>Revolutions is far better than Reloaded, however there were quite a few problems that I'll briefly mention, the first and biggest problem was the ending which left room for another installment in the Matrix series. The rather poorly handled ending was exactly that, an open ending, and not much more. I'm not going to mention anything else in relation to problems with the ending, as I'll probably give the ending away, but the way the film ends didn't seem to sit too well in relation to the rest of the story.<br/><br/>A lesser problem was where the Frenchman's character was re-introduced but then disappears as his and Persephone's characters dropped like a hot rock (supposedly this plot line will be taken up again in the next installment in the Matrix Series, although it is extremely doubtful that the studios will agree to make another one), then there was the slightly ridiculous death scene (I won't spoil it for those who haven't watched it) where the dying character seems to talk an awful lot for a person that sustained those injuries.<br/><br/>The special effects however (which, lets face it, is what everyone watches the film for) are top notch and fight scenes in this film (thank god) looked a lot more convincing than the well rehearsed ballet dances that they tried to pass off as fight scenes in Reloaded. Also the casting of Jada Pinkett Smith in this film was a master stroke. She is a definite asset to the series and she is great in all the shot's she's in. Also Morpheus's character was far less preachy, which in itself was a breath of fresh air<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it is definitely a film worth watching and is far better than most of the trash that's out there, but don't expect it to surpass the 1st, and in my opinion, the best installment in the Matrix Trilogy. I give this film 6 to 6.5 out of 10."
"keuhkokala","7","0","0","10 November 2003"," A better ending to the trilogy as I had thought
","I haven't read many favorable reviews about this movie. Many seem to think this is the worst movie of the trilogy. Well, I'll have to disagree. True, the movie has quite a lot of faults, and is far from the quality of the original Matrix, but it sure beats Reloaded.<br/><br/>This movie is the best of the trilogy in some aspects. For starters, this one is most exciting. In the other two, the main characters were more or less invulnerable. Only in the Matrix when the traitor pulls of the plugs of the crew in Matrix, were you really concerned about whether the main characters would die. But when the machine army attacks Zion, the battle is hopeless, desperate and epic a bit like the battle of Helm's Deep in LOTR: the Two Towers, but only more like a video game. The movie's best thing is some good plot twists. Usually a big Hollywood pictures can't surprise you, but this one has some twists I bet you won't see coming.<br/><br/>This one even has a plot, whereas Reloaded didn't. Sure, there's some plot holes and the movie doesn't explain every question the previous movies have made, but does it really have to? Nowadays people would like to see everything explained as clear as possible. This movie doesn't do that and has been teared apart. Hasn't it ever occurred to anyone that the questions should be thought about after seeing the movie. There's nothing like the experience of thinking about something in the movie that didn't make sense and suddenly getting it! I recommend you should give it a shot.<br/><br/>On the worse side, like many have pointed out, the Wachowskis seem to have forgotten what was it that made the first movie so famous; the incredible world of the Matrix is almost completely forgotten. The shoot-out at Club Hell is a dull routine action-sequence, but the last battle with Agent Smith covers it. Because Reloaded and Revolutions are more or less the same picture, the Wachowskis could've divided the actions in the real world and in the Matrix between the two movies better. Also the long talks. And the plot. One could think, these sequels could've been a lot better if they had done it. Well, I guess it's too late to worry about that. The beautiful ending with the little girl, the Oracle and Architecht watching the sun rise at least leave a good taste out of these movies. They are both OK action movies, it's just that everyone waited for them to be as brilliant as the first Matrix. The curse of the sequels being inferior struck again.<br/><br/>*** 1/2 (7/10)<br/><br/>The Best part (SPOILER): Before the Super Brawl we are introduced to the King of the machines. I got a kick out of seeing that surrealist creature. It's like a giant, floating sea urchin with a baby's face made of tiny robots. With an attitude."

","We are blessed to be living in an era where we have two fantastic trilogies which are not only fun to watch, but work on multiple different levels. These two movie franchises being `Lord of the Rings' and `The Matrix.' Unlike the hopelessly irrelevant `Star Wars' prequel trilogy, which tries so hard to be more than it is but ultimately seems rather forced; the LOTR and Matrix trilogies were designed from the ground up with an eye on the classics, theology and philosophy.  Both are far more messianic that the Star Wars prequel could ever hope to be, and both demonstrate how just one man (or one hobbit) can make all the difference in the world, quite literally.  We are still living and contemplating the lives and the legacies of such great men of peace like Buddha, Socrates and Jesus, all of who were just men (or perhaps a bit more than just mere `men') who had a better idea of just how life should be lived, and two of them, Socrates and Jesus, ultimately paid the highest price for their `radical' ideas.<br/><br/>Now we have the final installment of the Matrix trilogy.  It does a good job of tying up all the loose ends, and throws in a few more twists just to keep things interesting.  Right up to the very end it is obvious that philosophy, theology and the classics are very much on the minds of the Wachowski brothers, as we watch them create a seamless garment out of three very different threads.  In the opening, we see that Neo is trapped in the world of the `Trainman,'  He's stuck at the Mobile Avenue subway station, waiting for his train to come in.  This station is a `halfway' point between the human world and the Matrix, a kind of purgatory without the flames.  We soon find out that the Trainman works for the Merovingian, and they both are very determined to keep Neo `waiting' at that station for a very, very long time.<br/><br/>Thanks to a word from the Oracle (who else?) who is now in a new `shell,' Trinity and Morpheus set out to confront the Merovingian and get Neo back into the Matrix, so he can get back into his body!  From there, the story takes off, as we still have those pesky sentinels to deal with, who are getting ever closer to their goal of the complete destruction of Zion.<br/><br/>Much like the second movie, the third is filled with a cast of secondary characters that makes for a truly delicious movie going experience.  We have some new characters: `the Trainman,' and a nice Indian family of programs Neo meets waiting for a train at the Mobile Avenue station.  There is an expanded role for Seraph, the guardian of the Oracle.  All of our favorites are back as well: the Oracle (in a new `shell'), Smith, Naobi, the Merovingian, Cornel West and so on.  Never have I seen a film so filled with so many interesting and memorable secondary characters.  Each so very unique and yet very likable --even Smith himself in his own quirky way.<br/><br/>It's in this movie, as is obvious from the trailers, that we have the ultimate showdown between Neo and Smith.  But now we see each fully for what they are, and what their destiny is.  Smith is the incarnation of post-modernism, the quintessential nihilist, who sees no meaning or purpose in anything.  His only goal: to make everything over into his image-literally, and impose his idea of Utopia upon the entire Matrix, and the rest of the world as well.  It's this type of philosophy that gives us Nazi Germany and Maoist China: sameness is good, diversity bad.  Then we have Neo, the Zen Master Messiah, who refuses to jump into the tar pit of post-modern philosophical thought, but would much rather transcend it. He is the incarnation of faith, hope and love, `the virtue trinity,' embodied in one person.  One of these belief systems, Neo or Smith, has a viable, dynamic future, and one leads down the path to entropy and Big Brother.<br/><br/>This film has a wonderful time mixing and matching pantheism, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and various philosophical viewpoints and ideas.  The main characters of this movie are embodiments of these different worldviews, and one appreciates this trilogy so much more with the preunderstaning of these things in mind.  Do you need a thorough background in philosophy, theology and the classics to fully appreciate this film?  Yes, absolutely. If you don't, it will seem like so much intellectual nonsense with some good fight scenes and lots of automatic weaponry.<br/><br/>It is obvious to me that the Wachowski Brother's appreciate and pay homage to Frank Herbert's excellent books `Dune' and `Dune Messiah' in Revolutions. IMHO, these two books are the best that science fiction has ever produced, and it seems as if the Wachowski brothers agree, as some of the major themes and plot ideas seem to have come these sources.  No, it's not a repeat of `Dune' in a mechanical, apocalyptic setting, but we do see some tremendous similarity in themes and ideas between the two.  Of course `Dune' is not the sole source of inspiration here, and in looking for dominating themes and ideas, one would have to come to the conclusion that comic books, anime, Christianity and Buddhism are major contributing factors, probably in that order.<br/><br/>No movie is perfect, and `Matrix Revolution' has a few areas that could have been done better.  Yet, it is still so far beyond anything else out there that it's sins can easily be forgiven.  The LOTR is a close second, but in terms of overall production, the Matrix is far more interesting and imaginative.  One only has to compare the fight scenes between the two movies to see it.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions: 8/10"

","THE MATRIX: REVOLUTIONS (2003)spoiler alert((( The third and last movie about Matrix is here, well, it is a lot of things you can say about it, so let's start!<br/><br/>I'm going to start with a sort of summary of Matrix. 1) THE MATRIX (1999) - the first Matrix movie, olala!!! Man what a piece of movie masterwork! Reeves was back for good. It was one big goose bupper! It was so mystic, so thrilling, so extremely well made that when you left the cinema you were just shocked! You almoust wanted to cry in happiness, it was; the most original and exciting movie in history!! Yeah! It was!! We wanted much more!!!!<br/><br/>2) THE MATRIX: RELOADED (2003)The sequel, everybody wanted so much out of Matrix 2. I sat down wanting to see one thing; action actually. And I got what I wanted, Neo kicking so much ass that you can't see them, a lots of entertainment, although it didn't have the excitement or the thrills the first had, it was a worthy sequel.<br/><br/>3) THE MATRIX: REVOLUTIONS (2003) The last, the trilogy is finished. Neo has to finish it, well, why in the name of Marit/Mona Gabrielsen/Hegertun and myself Einar, didn't the Wachowski brothers pack the final climaxe between Smith and Neo with all they power! Why didn't they use every little cent of their budget to make that scene one of a kind, truly unforgettable! Nah, it seems like they doesn't want to, doesn't care. Without doubt the worst. --- The last Matrix movie is the most peculiar one in a sort of, but let's do another summary. 1) THE MOST INTERESTING MATRIX-MOVIE: The Matrix! (no doubt in the world!!!!) 2) THE MOST BORING MATRIX: The Matrix: Revolutions (yeah, it got!) 3) THE MOST ENTERTAINING MATRIX: The Matrix 4) THE MOST SLICK MATRIX: The Matrix 5) THE MOST PECULIAR MATRIX: The Matrix: Revolutions 6) THE MOST ROMANTIC MATRIX: The Matrix: Reloaded 7) THE MOST SEX-FIXED MATRIX: The Matrix Reloaded 8) THE MOST DARK MATRIX: The Matrix 9) THE BIGGEST ANTI-CLIMAXE MATRIX: The Matrix: Revolutions 10) THE BIGGEST CLIMAXE: The Matrix: Reloaded 11) THE BEST BULLETTIME: The Matrix (""Trinity! Help!!"") 12) THE WORST BULLETTIME: The Matrix Reloaded There you got 12 different Matrix ranches, it tells one thing; The Matrix 1 is the best!!!<br/><br/>Revolutions is the war between Smith(s), Neo and his buddies and the machines, it's pretty wild! The thing is; it never really shookes off! The Frenchman's sublime way of behaving is really cool and I like especially the scene where Morpheus, Trinity and that China-guy fires bullets and walks into that club of theirs, that's a very neat scene I think.<br/><br/>But, the most anti-climaxe ever is when Neo and the original Agent Smith finally challenges each other, standing soaking wet in the rain with a lots of copied Smith's standing around them watching. It looks so insane cool, Smith saying: ""We meet again Mr. Anderson""- with Neo replying. ""It ends tonight"" Oh man! Itsn't that genially! Give us the most entertaining fight ever! Give us Neo messing with over a billion Agent Smith's fighting them alone in the rain, but no! The Wachowski doesn't care! Man!! Ain't I dissapointed!!!<br/><br/>Let's put an end to this!

","As we can all agree, the first Matrix was the sh*t. Saw it in the theater about three times dragging different people with me each time. The second and third installment are a disappoinment. A bit too convoluted, zero character arcs with emotional depth etc (I only say that looking at the story-line from a screenwriter perspective),...but I can let that go because the 2nd & 3rd flicks are just franchise money-makers (everybody gets Pimped, it's America). My biggest problem is the idea that in this world, there can only be one Messiah. And everybody waits around for this candy-ass Neo to do something. My one wish would have been if the Brothers W would have at least hinted at a better philisophical stance that would intergrate the concept of ""God is in you"" for everyone. That way, all the people in this artificial world could be just as powerful as Neo. That would make me stamp the series as classic. People may point to Star Wars and say that the Luke Skywalker character was ""Messiah-like"", but I would argue that there were a lot of Jedi's around just as powerful as Luke, and he had to have the help of a lot of folks to beat the empire. But not Zion! These Mofo's have been fighting the machines since way before Neo was a constructed program, and they waste a whole movie (nay, 2!) waiting for his passive ass to sit around and think about his choices. Bitch, pick up a weapon and help people ""do"" something! Stop waiting for one man to save everybody. Save yourself. Of course I will probably check out the anime stories and talk to hard-core fanatics (whoops! Fans.)and get their take. But for me personally, regardless of the Gobbly-gook, and contrived philosophical slants people want to give the last installment, (oh please let it be the end for real!) waiting for the ONE to show up, and only ""one"", is like black people ( and I am black, so no one starts tripping cuz I'm using a black folks analogy) waiting for Martin Luther King Jr. to save them from racism in the machine that is America. Folks in Zion gotta be like Malcolm X, ""Stop singing and start swinging!"" The power that was in Neo was in all those characters. Their ""choice"" was not to use it and waste time waiting for the next Messiah to show up. To paraphrase Zora Neale Hurston, The Gods are only as powerful as ""we"" make them. Here's to the God in all of you! And if we are truly living in the Matrix right now, when you see Neo, kick him in the ass for me!"

","In the Matrix Revolutions I found a cine-surrogate for a man with whom I once had the misfortune of discussing Reloaded during the summer. He didn't understand it fully of course but he had plenty to say about it, oh yes, it was profound but he wasn't sure why and despite proclaiming most of the people who'd disliked it were probably 'stupid', he managed to deliver a soliloquy on the story full of ideas which said absolutely nothing. Revolutions conception echoes this wholly-thinking, empty headed idolatry with pixel perfect precision.<br/><br/>A film about the death of humanity, it ironically lacks the same with lifeless characterisation perhaps modelled more on your common domestic appliances than any real person. Despite all the talk of the forthcoming apocalypse I found myself rooting for the sentinels and Monica Belluci's cleavage, wondering why you'd want to survive in a world so tortuously bleak that it may be likened to living in Iceland all year round - where culture is so soul crushingly fatalist that the only topics ripe for discussion are death and metaphysics. OK, its wartime but the inhabitants of Zion who don't even enjoy a municipal shopping arcade or a local radio station must feel like they've been living through the blitz except thats its lasted 100 years! Worst of all heres a city where God, Neo-help us may or may not be Keeanu f'ing Reeves - a man with less emotional range than a sentinel with a stroke. You have to admire their will to fight in the face of such monumental obstacles especially in light of the catch-22 that characterises their predicament. Live in the real world and you've got death and an industrial eyesore to look forward to, get plugged back in and you may be bored to death listening to people who either witter on about the meaning of choice or worse find they're prone to making statements like 'what just happened could not have happened any other way' or 'she'll kill us all, shes in love!' Please Trinity, go ahead - SHOOT, i'm ready.<br/><br/>The original films infusion of high concept and existential crisis kept the philosophy and the minutiae of the plot where it belonged, in the subtext and therefore with the audience. Reloaded in contrast played like a computer game with inserts written by a philosophy undergraduate - painfully laboured, expositionary dialogue and the worst Q and A in modern memory bolted onto a plot that apparently was going to convince us this was more than just a moderately clever sci-fi actioner, yesss indeed, this was a semi-religious experience! Techno-theology would you believe. You wouldn't? Thought it sounded like the self-important pontifications of films geeks who read the screenplay to Star Wars instead of the bible and registered themselves as 'Jedi' in the last census? Well you can go to hell, this is no trilogy for non-believers.<br/><br/>The third film tempers down the bogus profundities and those tired myth making questions but the faith motif still dominates, yes, its an allegoricaust! Just as the characters (we'll call them that for now) must believe in Neo's divine credentials, we are asked to take a far greater leap of faith - namely that this all means something. That beyond the pre-school truisms (everything that has a beginning has an end, etc...) there is a dense, intellectually challenging story onto which a terrible script has been grafted, presumably by accident (perhaps the machines did it). The less they say the greater the ambiguity and the harder we work but hang on, what if this was the movie version of a kinder surprise egg without the toy inside and the filmmakers were in fact trying to preempt audience response by alluding to a grander design safe in the knowledge it will get buttons pushed the world over? The gag is this is it, there is no more. There, don't you feel stupid?<br/><br/>This may be one of the first blockbusters specifically designed for the internet and fan boy community. With so much left deliberately underdeveloped and unexplained it'll be mecca for the terminally bored who'll no doubt write thousands of words on it when it deserves little or no attention. Fortunately I'm not falling into that trap. <br/><br/>Watching Revolutions you feel it could have been written by a computer, ergo we bear witness to the systemic anomaly that ultimately leads to permanent and fatal errors. Its not all bad. The battle for Zion is impressive - visceral and exciting but the fact that this is the film's best sequence, an action set-piece rather than a moment of character development, testifies to the fact this baby has a weaker core than an apple dropped into a bowl of maggots. The 2nd and 3rd films crucially lack the economy and tight plotting of the first film that, combined with what felt like an original and innovative design, hid the shortcomings of the characters. This is all too evident in these joyless sequels where flabby plotting and ruinous doses of sentiment and exposition dominate (Was there any scene more painful that the demise of the one of 'major' characters?) At the end its all over but it isn't, I enjoyed it but I didn't - A load of old pixels? That I believe. Can we forget all about it now please?"

","Matrix Revolutions<br/><br/>Ok to save you all turning blue from holding your breath (yeah right) I am going to tell you up front that Matrix Revolutions is a good film. Well, at least average. All the elements are there: interesting characters, intelligent writing, decent acting (yes even Keanu) and excellent, at times inspired, cinematography. It is exciting, well paced, entertaining, and has something to say out side of the cosmetic. The action tells the story instead of replacing it. The special effects are not so obtrusive that the human element is obscured yet they are very well done. It was edited effectively enough to build tension in the right places.<br/><br/>Weren't expecting that were you. I am very surprised that so many critics have panned this movie out of hand simply because its predecessor was so appalling. Worst. Movie. Ever. According to my mother at least and even though she doesn't go to the movies very often this assessment is not far off. I, on the other hand, am willing to put Reloaded in a better light even if it is simply because it contained essential plot points with out which Revolutions could not have operated.<br/><br/>Revolutions is not, and never could be, the classic ground breaking mind bending marriage of science fiction and post human philosophy Matrix is but it is a worthy successor and captures the spirit of the seminal film effectively. But be warned: it doesn't have that mind blowing element in action, visualization, or story.  In the end comparisons are pointless. When considered on its own Revolutions isn't bad. You will like the characters (or hate them where appropriate), which have been fleshed out beyond the card board cut outs that were used to populate Reloaded. You will like the story, which is generally well constructed even if it is a bit simplistic. It manipulates the emotions rather than preying on your intellect. Symbolic? Probably not. But before you say this film sucks ask yourself what you were expecting. It cannot escape being a sequel. But when viewed with an objective eye it is a sequel in the spirit of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Revolutions is an integral part and vital continuation of a compelling story.<br/><br/>5 pairs of pants. Perhaps even four is you think Keanu Reeves is as sexy as I do all tall slender and elegant dressed in black with those big pretty eyes mmmmmmmm mm delicious husky deep voice so snoggable it's almost tragic that bitch Trinity I could kick her kung fu skinny...<br/><br/>Anyway, perhaps it is interesting to consider the trilogy as a whole now that closure has been achieved so effectively. I had high hopes for it. A Star Wars for a post modern generation. An artificial yet meticulously constructed mythology to fill the void of religion and real role models. There were Tolkienesque possibilities. The major obstacle in achieving this was the creators themselves. The Warchowski brothers are not film makers or even writers. If they were then Reloaded would have actually ended up being a film instead of being a string of choice shots from a new, rather shallow, shooter video game. A film maker would have been able to put Reloaded and Revolutions into one film with out losing any of the excitement, story, or development of character that is abundant in Revolutions and is completely absent in Reloaded.<br/><br/>However, this is not the case and we are left with the rather disappointing fact that the Matrix is a fluke. It is the single immaculately conceived brain child of a couple of well read, geeky, video gaming, pop culture junkies who lucked out, which maybe is not so disappointing after all. The Matrix cannot be recreated, simulated, copied, or sequelled. As cheesey as it sounds it changed the way we look at film, how we make movies, and how we consider the future of our species and its relationship with technology. Yet it compassed all the human qualities that a make a classic. It achieved a rare and keen resonance with the zeitgeist to produce an enduring artifact which became the momentary fulcrum of contemporary culture. A thing is either before the Matrix or after the Matrix. That is hard act to follow."

","Those of you who have seen the first matrix film would have been dasled by its special effects.When i saw the film i thought it did not do the main characters justice. I hardly ever saw Morpheus and the storyline was nothing to go by. Although these were infact the worst parts of the film i thought everything else did quite well. It was also reviewed in a newspaper i read and it said in no lesser terms that the film was rubbish and they had seen it all before. I think thats a bit melodramatic as there are a lot more poorer films out there with cheesy lines and poor special effects. Overall the film was good, not great but good. What i thought was great about the film was the part where Neo and Agent Smith are fighting i thought that was very good and that seemed to keep my interest. When it comes out on DVD i will definately be buying it. So for those of you who have not seen it, i urge you to see it so you can see if you agree with me or not."

","The real shame about the second and third films is that they've killed the mystery and thus most of the joy of the first. Whilst the Wachowski directors are very good at posing and presenting interesting thought-provoking and downright *philosophical* questions, such as they do in abundance in the first film, they prove unsurprisingly bad at answering them, meaning that the dialogue sadly dissolves into a sequence of dispiriting dead-end shuttle exchanges along the lines of:<br/><br/>Character 1: Why am I here? (impassive stare)<br/><br/>Character 2: Only you know the answer...<br/><br/>Character 1: How can I know the answer when I cannot know how to answer no to what I do not know? No?<br/><br/>Character 2: It is your choice to know or not to know. There is no no-no. (even more impassive stare)<br/><br/>Character 1: What is choice?<br/><br/>Character 3: (clearly agitated, interrupting) Look guys, this is giving me a migraine. How 'bout some kung-fu!!<br/><br/>All: Great idea! *CARNAGE*<br/><br/>=> The nice thing about movies that pitch themselves in the way the Matrix trilogy does is that there are always going to be holes which the fans can go home and fill and explain with their imagination. This, however, cannot negate the fact that Matrix 2 and 3 have clearly overstretched themselves, and their directors' brains. (you can just see the Wachowskis desperately trying to tie all the ends together over a pack of nachos and a Bud: ""No, dude, Neo can't say no to not knowing about there being no knowing, no? Whoa, sling me another beer and let's just send this thing off to Warner. Sack it.."") That, incidentally, is no criticism: if you're looking to the Matrix films for an answer to life, the universe and everything, I'd recommend that you simply take the answer as given by Douglas Adams in the Hitchiker's Guide: 42. It's so much less strain, and it also releases those poor Wachowski brothers from being unfairly labelled visionaries. They're not - give 'em a break!<br/><br/>Personally, I'm happy to applaud the first film as a revolutionary piece of cinema which actually got people thinking about a blockbuster, and to shelve the other two on the DVD rack with The Mummy Returns and Independence Day with a sympathetic smile and a nod: ""nice try, pal, you did good. Too bad you were caught out."" which is incidentally by no means, in my opinion, to do them a disservice. Loved all the CGI. Great.<br/><br/>:-)<br/><br/>10/10"
"Blazeemupx","Null","0","0","10 November 2003"," Great film, dont believe the other bad reviews (spoilers)
","don't believe the bad reviews, they don't understand the film and probably did not understand the first one. Neo couldn't use the same technique against Bane as he did against Smith because he did not yet understand what he had to do and was not capable of doing it. He was supposed to sacrifice himself in Reloaded but could not stand losing Trinity, so he didn't do it. After the Bane scene, when Trinity dies later in the movie, its gives Neo the strength to do what he did.<br/><br/>And whoever said zion is still plugged in and its a matrix within a matrix is an idiot. The reason Neo can use his powers in the real world is because when he touched the source, although his body left it, part of his mind was still there. He was still connected to the source unconsciously. It is only at the end of Reloaded when he feels the sentinels at the end that he realizes something is different. He can control the sentinels and anything that is under the control of the Deus Ex Machina because they are all connected to the machine city and to the source. Because he is now a part of the source, they are connected to him as well. Thus he can kill all the sentinels. As for Smith, he is no longer controlled by the machine city. He is a virus. It is only at the end when Smith takes over Neo that Smith is destroyed because Neo is plugged into the Matrix, and connected to the source, and also now is connected to all of the Smiths because Smith copied himself onto Neo. Thus the Deus Ex Machina attacks and kills Neo, which kills all the other Smiths including the real one because they are all connected. The oracle was right, the war will only end if we are together. The humans and the machines came together to put a truce to this war. Now Zion can give every human the choice of whether they want to be unplugged or not. That was the truce. Everything is changed."

","Allright, first of all, I cannot believe that alot of people thought the movie was crap. I thought it was a brilliant movie.<br/><br/>It was definately better than Reloaded, but it didn't beat The Matrix. The Matrix was full of surprises and all, and to me, Morpheus was this kind of Matrix-God who knew everything. In Reloaded he was just one of the many. That was weird to see.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>Alright, Revolutions. It started immediately where Reloaded had ended, and I didn't mind at all. Only.... who the what was Bane? I didn't remember him! Ofcourse, he's the dude who was 'assimilated' by Smith in Reloaded. But that just completely slipped through my memory, and so I was confuzzled. What did disappoint me, was that Neo didn't recognise Bane/Smith from the beginning where Bane starts saying ""Mister Anderson..."" in Smith's famous way of talking. He could have prevented going blind from the beginning. But well, I guess it must have been fate.<br/><br/>The Oracle with a new look. At first I was really surprised, because the Oracle from the first two movies was just brilliant. And I was like, ""Well that's a bad look-a-like!"" but then again - you're talking about The Matrix, and then she told us that it was intentionally. I had peace with that. I also loved to see that the other Smith's backed off when she was made a Smith.<br/><br/>The fight between Neo and Smith was definitely brilliant.<br/><br/>It was bad luck for the Smiths that the Oracle Smith seemed in charge now, and that also took away victory for Smith. When Smith tried to remember what he was supposed to say (as he had foreseen it happen), and then suddenly said, ""Everything that has a beginning, has an end, Neo."" was really cool. It made Neo realise what he had to do. And so he got 'assimilated'. End of the Smiths. Too bad, he's my favorite character.<br/><br/>The fight for Zion was done great too. Although I must agree with the person who said that the machines looked awfully familiar to the cargothing in Aliens.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was really nice.

","Well. We didn't expect all that much after Reloaded but I'm still disappointed. Number One, as many here already pointed out, was great in its newness in thinking, creation of action/fight scenes, use of special effects and mesmerizing the audience with its unconventional ideas that almost brought us back to old Plato, who believed that everything is an illusion and we never get to see the 'real' world. A philosophical, interesting, and beautiful movie. Neo is a code name of a normal computer guy who we accompany in discovering the 'real' world. We are as surprised and fascinated with the whole idea as Neo the newborn rebel is. Morpheus is as grand as a god in number one. We listen to him with open mouth as he explains us about the matrix and teaches Neo all his tricks. We meet the mean program Smith, we get a taste of Zion and sentinels chasing hoovercrafts.<br/><br/>But then: Reloaded evolves into an ordinary sci-fi B movie. The Wachowski<br/><br/>brothers fall for easy money as they choose to bore us with more of the same (often unnecessary) fight scenes, the much-hated orgy scene (sigh), stereotypes all over the place (the love of Trinity and Neo, the love of Morpheus and Niobe, the Merovingean and his babe, etc.). They had a chance of fixing things when they introduced the Architect, but Revolutions shows us that they didn't take it. Doesn't everybody feel that Reloaded is totally unnecessary now that you've seen revolutions? What did it contribute actually? It gave us one mildly interesting idea and that was that Neo wasn't the first one, and we weren't sure what to believe anymore.<br/><br/>That idea could have been used to torture the audience with uncertainty and doubt. Couldn't they have done more with the Oracle and the Architect, given them more depth and mystery, couldn't they just have given us a more interesting ending, have lifted a little tip of a veil that would uncover again something new, like the experience we had in the first movie? Was it so hard to come up with an interesting idea?<br/><br/>*warning, spoilers!*<br/><br/>Besides the ending, most of the movie was ridiculous, though not totally unpleasant to watch if one set aside any expectations that were left. Morpheus has unfortunately transformed into any stubborn guy who believes in a messias. His character has not contributed anything in the last two movies. Then, the scene in the Merovingean's club was also totally unnecessary and stupid. And of course there has to be a woman dancing naked and the babe sitting there with her breasts almost exploding. Sigh. It makes me tired. And just one thing about when Neo and Trinity fly over the clouds - how hard would it be for the machines to use solar energy? Just wondering. And it was too easy for them to get to Machine City, but I suppose the film makers were running out of time. And of course he would face Smith again, and we had to sit through 10-15 (how long was it?) minutes of useless fighting -- why??? We KNEW he would have to find another way of getting rid of Smith, just like in Reloaded it was useless with that looooooooooooooooooooooooong fighting scene with all those Smiths. It's boring to watch! And oh, Zion and the defense of the dock. Sorry but that was completely ridiculous. A couple of APUs against the sentinels, the EMP that wiped out the computer system (but not that of the ships when they use it??). The more I think about it, the worse it gets. A missed chance to make film history."

","Though ""The Matrix Revolutions"" does not deserve the reference consider: <br/><br/>Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more. It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.<br/><br/><ul><li>Macbeth</li></ul><br/><br/>No, Andy and Larry Wachowski are not Shakespeare. However, after 2 hours and 4 minutes of ""sound and fury"", we don't even get a profound relationship to nothing or empty and meaningless. Instead we get eclectic cyber-Taoism in a well intentioned, but unsatisfying conclusion of what was once a captivating messiah tale. The Wachowski Brothers could have really taken a cue from Bill-- less is more. Really. <br/><br/>Revolutions is a technical marvel, with some good performances-- Keanu Reeves included. Though this Act III along with Act II (Reloaded) will forever, taint the wonder and possibility of ""The Matrix"". This is the biggest travesty of all. ""Revolutions"" starts off so promisingly. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) confront the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson). Trinity says ""You give me Neo, or we all die, right here, right now."" Trinity is willing to die for Neo (Keanu Reeves), perhaps hinting that ""Revolutions"" will have a significant love story back drop. Great. No, not really. Rather it could have been strong, and made the movie a lot more human. As the story opens Neo is caught in some realm between the Matrix and the Machine World. There is something like 20 hours before the last human refuge, Zion, will be under siege by the Sentinels (deadly octopus-like machines). Neo being The One is the only human who can save Zion. We get the insight that Agent Smith (a very effective Hugo Weaving)is in fact a cyber virus. Also Neo and Agent Smith are the same--rather one can not exist without the other. This is The Matrix version of Yin and Yang. The evolving Neo can also jump between the real world and The Matrix without being ""jacked in"". This leads to some amazing circular logic as the story unfolds tearing large holes in conscience and time. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Revolutions becomes a souless exercise-- which is unfortunate. This is largely due to the plot. Consequently, this wastes some good performances. Reeves is better this time around as Neo, the chosen One. He is the tragic hero. Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity is strong and understated. She has some awesome scenes, but they are few. I really love her character.<br/><br/>Jada Pinkett Smith's role of Captain Niobe is more deserving of her talents as compared to ""Reloaded"". She is strong, smart, and gorgeous. The stand out is Collin Chou as Seraph, Guardian of The Oracle (Mary Alice). Chou is cool, good-looking, and charismatic. He is a great martial artist. His fight scenes are stunning. <br/><br/>In the end, after all the noise, some questions have been answered, more generated, and logic warped beyond belief. Some may feel cheated, but I suspect most really don't care. Because the story does not respect our affinity for the characters in The Matrix, instead opting for the very clever and esoteric ending. In the beginning of the movie, Love is described as a human construct. It is. And I think the Wachowski Brother forget what they were arguing for. Getting nothing would have been better."
"HarrySlicer","8","0","0","9 November 2003"," Good closure to the trilogy.
","*Mild Spoilers*<br/><br/>The problem with The Matrix Reloaded was the film's ability to completly baffle the audience. Unless you were completely on the ball, there was no hope of the average target audience understanding just exactly what was going on. Also, with Reloaded, I didn't feel connected with the characters. Trinity and general characters had no emotion, no sense of urgency like she/they did in the orginal Matrix. Also, Agents have slowly dwindled from the movies to a point of non-existence. Their brief appearences in Reloaded were laughable, with anyone being able to take them on. No longer are they feared like in the original movie.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions, however, addresed these issues wonderfully. It was as if they shot a new movie in five months, having seen feedback. Acting in general was raised to an acceptable if not good level (although Neo and Trinity's relationship was leaving much to be desired), and I felt the connection with the characters and the movie coming back. I started to care for Zion again, I felt a sense of impending danger when the machines started to invade Zion, and the Kid opening the gate with ""Neo, I believe"" reminds we why I bought the Animatrix in the first place. It almost brought a tear to my eye. Also, I welcome the idea that Reloaded was about Neo discovering his new found powers and putting them to work for us all to see; all right, we get the point, he's somewhat of a God. What I didn't want was a continution of this in Revolutions, and I feel rather satisfied with the end result.<br/><br/>The movie thankfully didn't completly shut all doors on theories that many a people have come up with over the past few months. While attaining this, it still managed to proviude valuable explanations to certain questions that people wanted answering. I've read reviews that said nothing was explained, and that ""there's room for sequels/prequels"". Well, I say to them this; why do you want to be spoon fed information? For once in your life, can you draw valuable conclusions as a result of your own thought process? Also, the Animatrix and the Enter the Matrix game (the latter being rather mediocre) fill in those information gaps, even if it is to assertain more money for the franchise. But to prove my point; the Matrix within a Matrix theory is still viable. The Machines could possible still have another level of control, hence why the Architect decided to let the humans free, and why there is a truce in the first place. His ending speech at the end of Reloaded completly backs this up, if you interpret it that way. ""As long as they are aware of the choice"". On Neo's powers; ""the powers of the One can trascend the system"". This level of control/power goes beyond the original Matrix and into the ""real world"" Matrix, hence Neo's ""wireless jacking"" ability because essentially it's all part of the same system (I was half expecting the Intel Centrino logo to flash up on the screen).<br/><br/>
One gripe I have with this movie, however, is that people will go into this expecting high octane action with people plugged into the Matrix. If you have friends who believe this, then dispel this myth as soon as you can. It was always obvious that the third movie of the series was going to be based around Zion, and Neo pointed this out at the end of the second movie; ""This is about Zion"".  The only other complaint I have is the purpose of the Trainman. I didn't really feel this was an important part of the movie, and it all seemed rather pointless. Maybe I simply didn't understand the significance of the little girl (Sati). I like to think that she symbolised both hope, and a new beginning.<br/><br/>The message of the movie is also fairly simple; believe, and anything can happen. Also, the choices we make in life are just that - our choices. There is no set path, there is no fixed equation to be solved. All you have to do is free your mind. I think there was religious reference (Neo spread in the shape of a cross numberous times throuhout the film), but it shouldn't be explored too deeply, like I've seen happen.<br/><br/>I'd give it an eight out of ten. A very enjoyable and memorable way to end the trilogy."

I found myself several times looking at my watch or just looking around being bored because stuff just didn't grab attention.  I already have the first two on DVD, but I'm sure not going to buy the third one because I really have no desire to ever see it again, and I will not buy a movie I don't like just to ""complete the trilogy"".<br/><br/>Anyway, HERE BEGIN THE SPOILERS **********************************<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
Here are several things that bothered me about the movie and contributed to my dislike of it. * If I wanted to see a long battle with people shooting guns and rockets at an attacking army, I would have gone to see an Arnold movie or some other general war/action flick.  I watch the Matrix to see people do cool stuff in the matrix.  Besides that, it seemed really pointless to me that they were fighting to defend against this force that would wipe them out unless Neo did something amazing to rescue them.  They would do just as well to just hope and pray for Neo because their fighting isn't going to accomplish anything. * Trinity's death scene--boring dialogue and too long. * The one stop train station--a big waste of time.  If they were using it to show where Neo is as his mind is ""trapped between our world and his"", why can Trinity and Morpheus go there to pick him up? * OK, we knew Neo could fly in M1 and M2, but now all of a sudden Smith can fly too?  Why didn't he fly in Reloaded if he had gone beyond who he was? * Also, I was looking forward to some cool moves in a big showdown with Neo and Smith.  Instead, they are causing craters and mushroom clouds and seismic activity as they throw each other through buildings, fly and crash into each other, etc.  It just turns into some kind of clash of the titans-style pummelling that just seems dumb.<br/><br/>So, the last movie was pretty bad because it wasn't really the Matrix anymore.

From the scene with the love birds heading into machine land and avoiding certain death by going above them, in the sky, it sure looked like there was an ample source of solar energy about fifty feet above the machines.  Now I don't mind when there are holes in movies, bound to happen, but the overall disappointment that I felt at the end of this movie made me a little more critical than normal.  Everything in the second movie was left up in the air.  This movie was supposed to tie things together.  I feel like these guys had a really novel idea, tried to keep it going, and then forgot which way was up and which way was down.  It seems like they decided to rip off some Lynch tactics, maybe from Mulholland Drive, and just throw out a bunch of confusing crap for the audience to come to their own conclusions.<br/><br/>To sum up my view on the trilogy.....<br/><br/>The Matrix (the original) was amazing.  This movie broke new ground and showed people an idea that had little to no flaws.  It could actually be true, we could all be jacked in to some computer program and our bodies could really just be ""copper top"" batteries.<br/><br/>The Matrix Reloaded was a complete cliffhanger that caused a bunch of confusion as to what was really going on, hence the pages and pages of internet discussion groups on interpretations of the meanings behind the film.  There were some amazing scenes and the movie made you think, but mostly it was a big ball of action and confusion that I thought would be explained in the final film.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions was crap.  There was so much of this movie that should have never made it past the floor of the editing room.  Long, drawn out scenes that should have either not existed or should have been one minute long instead of ten (trinity's death).

","To put this into context, I loved the Matrix.  I was dissappointed by Reloaded - it had amazing effects and set pieces, but dreadful story.<br/><br/>*MILD SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Alas Revolutions continues that downward trend, to the extent that it has surely shipwrecked the entire Matrix franchise?<br/><br/>The main problems I saw:<br/><br/>1) Lack of discovery & surprise - in the first movie, the audience learnt the secrets of the real & Matrix worlds as Neo did.  The only thing we discover is that the plotting/story of the first film appears a fluke, as all this dishes up is some religious nonsense.<br/><br/>2)  The trekky ship vs sentinel bits of matrix were at the periphery - they were merely a tenuous backdrop for allowing all the really cool in the matrix outfits, kung fu, gun fights, bullet time effects etc.  Here they are given almost complete prominence.  I counted only 5 scenes in the matrix (including the train station) in the whole film, and only 2 of these were action sequences.  No freeway chase here.<br/><br/>3) The show down with Agent Smith - grand finale and all, seemed to go on forever, didn't add or explain anything, and was also oddly similar to the end of Superman 2, flying supervillains and all.<br/><br/>4)  Neo's powers extending beyond the Matrix (as shown at the end of Reloaded) is, frankly, ridiculous.  In fact, the whole religious iconography of ""Neo is the saviour"" gave a philisophical edge to movie 1 - here it is just over the top and spoils things.<br/><br/>* SPOILER *<br/><br/>5)  With Smith gone, what possible reason do the machines have for keeping the new found peace?<br/><br/>A stupid waste of an excellent franchise opportunity...."

","I really do not see what peoples beef is with Revolutions.  Considering the direction the series was going, the evolution of the characters, escalation of the story, and overral thematic elements, I felt this was a fitting end. Many disect and rip apart the love scene between Neo and Trinity.  WHY!? I feel it was the most emotionally riveting scene in the movie! I ALMOST CRIED FOR GOD'S SAKE!!! The first twenty minutes of the movie were to add tension and propell the viewer into the neccessary state of awarness for what was to come, not mindless plot developement.  And I think that the build up was well worth it for the Man/Machine war, and final apocalyptical battle between Neo and Smith.  So ladies and gents, see the movie.  And tell me, really, what's wrong with it? Are people so lazy that they'll criticize a movie for having an ending where you have to ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR YOURSELF? YOU KNOW, COME UP WITH YOUR OWN THEORIES ON WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED? I personally like movies where you can do that."

","I watched the first film on the Friday, the second on the Saturday and the final on the Sunday.  My impression is this, they should have released/made this film later than sooner...<br/><br/>I know that Village Roadshow and Warner Bros wanted to capitalize on the success of Reloaded as soon as possible attempting to generate as much revenue as they could, but the flaws in this showed in the biggest of ways...<br/><br/>1. The film was not as good as either of the 2, the highway chase in Reloaded was a lot better done and alot more exciting.<br/><br/>2. Bane, I know most people know that the Smith character was in the Matrix and not near Zion, but the way he talked and refering to Neo in that world as Mr Anderson, true that he was written with the Smith program inside of the Matrix before leaving, but since Neo can see things that most of the people couldn't see in the form of energy and code who did he think he was talking to...<br/><br/>3. Although I liked the fight at the end of the film and thought it was good that they didnt make it some short 2-3 minute ordeal, it didn't bring anything new to the table it was like there was nothing new in it....

"batorre","Null","0","0","9 November 2003"," Unfairly Judged
","The two sequels to the Matrix have received an exceeding amount of criticism from the fans of the first film. Having just seen it, I truly cannot understand why.<br/><br/>There will be no spoilers here. These are my responses to the most oft heard critiques.  Ironically, the complaints the fan-base are making are the reasons I enjoyed the movie:<br/><br/>1) The Philosophy of The Matrix. --- Many people have complained that the sequels put too much focus on the how's and why's, and ended up being mind-numbing diatribes of pseudo-existential babble. I disagree. If anything, I think the latter two films have done an excellent job of expanding what the first movie hinted to. The first film, while brilliant, really took the easy way out at the end. It took all the potential of what The Matrix itself could mean, and the implications of those dual worlds, and ignored it all so that we could have a shoot-out. The lobby shoot-out was fantastic, but let's face, it left little to the imagination. We knew Trinity and Neo would win, as we knew Neo would beat Smith in the final fight of Part One. If anything I think the sequels should be applauded for adding so much more depth to the story of The One. Instead of Neo persisting as merely a man, inexplicably capable of flashy kicks and jumps, we've learned WHY he is what he is -- The purpose for his being. It makes the choices he comes to -- the wielding of his power in ways the machines did not intend -- that much more meaningful. We learned the ""why"" in Reloaded; Revolutions is the pay-off. Neo's choices are no longer clear to us (or even to the Oracle or himself), but as an audience we trust his choices, because we have seen him go against convention in the previous films and succeed. These choices would carry far less weight without a history and background. If he had remained simply a Superman figure, his choices would be inconsequential, because we would know that he would always win; that he COULD always win. Now we're not so sure though, and the movie is more suspenseful because of it.<br/><br/>
2) Dialogue Over Action. --- Similar to Complaint #1, many fans have called for 'a little less talk and lot more action.' Sitting through Revolutions I could not possibly understand how much more action they expected to be put into one movie. As I said earlier, I think the story of The Matrix has too much depth and potential to simply abandon the story itself in place of action. This is not `Speed'. The action and excitement is still there, but it has now become a product of story and not a contrived addition to it. Specifically in Revolutions, we are treated to dizzying scenes of action and suspense; yet, for the most part, these scenes do not feel obligatory. They exist to drive the story. More than that, minute-for-minute there is much more action in this picture than even in the heralded first movie. The fact that this action does not deprive of us a great story and the culmination to that story is quite amazing.<br/><br/>3) Video Game Special Effects. --- I almost have to agree with the detractors here. Reloaded felt like watching a video game. I would be willing to bet that this was actually a conscious decision on the part of filmmakers rather than just a product of the script exceeding the technology. It fits their logic, that if we are actually NOT watching Neo fight Smith; if we ARE watching Neo's avatar fight Smith, that the scenes SHOULD look artificial. The logic is sound, but it took a lot out of the movie. It is hard to feel suspense when the CGI characters you are watching have no tangible quality for you to focus on. Reloaded had this feel, and it took away from the suspense of the scenes; even facing a battle with hundreds of Agent Smiths, it was hard to feel apprehensive for Neo, because we knew his avatar would eventually hit the 'Fly Away' button. This problem was corrected in Revolutions. There is still an overwhelming amount of CGI used in the picture, but it is used more effectively. The scenes that use CGI feel right. There is weight and depth to the animation that keeps the audience interested. The hand-to-hand fight scenes return to their origins, and as in the first film, they are mostly practical photography, with only the occasional intercut animated scenes. Again, because of the more realistic feel of these CG scenes, as an audience we are kept involved with the outcome of the fight, not simply observers of the inevitable.<br/><br/>
To summarize, I feel Revolutions has successfully explored and concluded the potential that the first two pictures hinted to. The first film still remains my favorite. The visuals at the time were breathtaking, and the potential for the depth of the story (albeit undercut by the film itself at the movie's end) was enough to keep your brain churning long after its end. Revolutions follows in that tradition, and in many ways does a better job with the material. There are suspenseful and exciting sequences that are driven by the story (not vice versa) after which we are given an appropriate conclusion followed by a satisfying and tantalizing epilogue. As with any great story, we know that this is not actually The End. The filmmakers have created an alternate reality, and as such that reality will continue to thrive. The films may be concluded, but that is just one arc, one story, from that reality. Many questions have been answered, but many more persist; and like the first film, long after you have left the theater from Revolutions you can ponder and imagine the potential for what will follow. Maintaining such excitement for the unknown and untold is truly the hallmark of a great story and expert story-telling."

","I really enjoyed watching both The Matrix and Matrix Reloaded thoroughly, as well as the Animatrix.  I even fought with friends who did not like the second movie, explaining that the nature of a middle movie was not to have all questions answered, but to build up suspense for the final chapter.  I was very excited about seeing this moving this afternoon, and while I didn't totally hate it, I did think that it did not deliver the punch that many people were waiting for.  I felt like there was too much action and not enough thought. I felt that some of the concepts that were so well developed were dropped and while in real life this may or may not be acceptable, in a story that we have been following since 1999, it is very disappointing. I hope that when everyone reads this, they understand that this is just reality from my perspective and not take it as me trying to bash the movie.  I genuinely wanted to like this movie.<br/><br/>I really felt that the Matrix jumpers, from Morpheus to Neo, all deserved better endings.  Do we save Trinity in one movie just to kill her in the next?  And Morpheus seemed powerless in this movie, kind of like a back seat driver.  Even Neo seemed not to matter as much in this movie. Ultimately, he was defeated in the end.  His only job was to be assimilated by Smith in order for the Master Control in Machine City to delete the virus, which was Smith. Watch Reloaded again if you don't believe this next point.  In Reloaded, the Oracle was never meant to be the mother of the matrix.  When Neo assumes this, the architect sets him straight by sarcastically saying ""Please!""  There was no room for interpretation because of the way he said it.  Many of us believed Persephone was living in the Matrix, researching human nature as she did with the kiss between herself and Neo.  It was dissapointing to see her do absolutely nothing in this movie.  It would have made for a great turn of events, as well as not left everything to the oracle. After all of the philisophical discussion of the first movies, I think that all of the violence and heartbreak of the last movie was uncalled for; it was a sort of betrayal to many of the fans that were hoping for more creative writing instead of a buyout to violence and ""neat movie effects.""<br/><br/>I have read a lot of comments and I wanted to say that I don't think that Neo was a program.  I believe that the Matrix wrote programs for all humans that lived within it and Neo's role was that of ""The One."" Remember the line where Cypher says something like, ""The Matrix tells my brain that this steak is delicious...."" the Matrix does have the ability to add code to the human brain and interact just as it does with programs.  This is also why it is hard to tell a program from a human in the Matrix. The movies did raise many interesting questions and it was fun while it lasted, and as Revolutions states, ""Every beginning must have an end.""  I think this movie became too general and tried to cover too much and therefore lost focus on what is was truly supposed to be about. True: the trilogy had an ending. Also true: not a memorable one. Thanks for letting me express my opinion.  If I did not enjoy this movie as much as the last two; I at least am glad that they were made :)"
"sbyers77","4","0","0","9 November 2003"," Not only does ""Revolutions"" fail to answer all the questions, it creates more.
","The more I think about it, the more ""Revolutions"" was horrible. I am a fan of the original Matrix, and was dismayed with the release of the second, but revolutions was bleh. I saw it a few days ago to understand my feelings.<br/><br/> Revolutions has failed in a few ways, here is (in my opinion) what went wrong:<br/><br/> 1) Reloaded and Revolutions written and filmed at the same time. Without time in between the two movies, you can lose track of where exactly you want to take the movie, and you miss out on others opinions about the movie, and if the last one is already filmed, then you might not make a movie how everyone wants. Too many times did I sit there rolling my eyes going, ""uhg, what the hell is this crap?""<br/><br/> 2) Didn't answer anything! I'm sorry, but if I have to be a philosophy major to understand the movie, then screw you. Perhaps there were no clear-cut answers because the Wickowski brothers themselves didn't know what to say... and have ""peace"" with the machines, and allude to Christianity.<br/><br/> 3) No Guns and Morpheous was a wuss. In the first Matrix there were hella guns, killing and blood. I don't care if this is ""cool"" or not, but stupid trench-coat mafia dorks had to ruin the tone of the rest of the matrix's by ""toning down"" this sort of thing. And I don't know what happened, but after Morepheous was ""proven wrong"" he just disappeared, he was in Revolutions for like 5 minutes.<br/><br/> 4) Sold out. From the ridiculous overuse of GM vehicles in Reloaded to the blatant PowerAde ads in the subway, The Matrix has sold out. You may not want to believe it, but they have. This was most evident to me in the evolution of music through the movies. First Matrix, they were actual songs by bands, Reloaded was all orchestral music, with Rage Against the Machine for the end credits, and ALL orchestral music in Revolutions, AND NO RAGE! The redemption factor for Revolutions (for me) was to see what Rage song they used for the end credits... low and behold, NO RATM! I walked out very sad indeed.<br/><br/> Revolutions doesn't not answer any questions it claimed to answer. It creates more philosophical questions without explaining those as well. Little use of ""the matrix"" in a Matrix movie was blasphemous... but then again the whole movie was as well.<br/><br/> I give Revolutions a 4 out of 10."

","Rejoice. Why? Revolutions didn't suck. It didn't suck so much that it crosses to the other side of the spectrum. Once there, it runs as fast as it can until it reaches Amazing. Because that's what it is: Amazing.<br/><br/> When the matrix came out, i was blown away. The story, effects, directing, all top notch. Then i entered a fetal state, with the rest of the world, as we endured the long haul until the next installment. Then it came, it was average, and it became hip to rag on it. Unfortunately, somebody somewhere decided to spread those ill feelings to the final film. Because of this, many people watched Revolutions with the same spite generated by Reloaded, and it warped them. Let me assure you, Revolutions is in every way a worthy conclusion to the saga begun by the first film.<br/><br/> The story is actually somewhat simplistic once it gets gathering up the loose ends from Reloaded. As soon as it gets beyond the rekindling of conflicts presented in the last film, it neatly divides into a few major conflicts: the machines are coming for zion, and smith is a baaad, baaad program. From there, things thought impossible are made possible.<br/><br/> A 17 minute battle sequence that is confined to one little underground base? surely it was tiring? no. actually, your mother is tiring, and the battle sequence is absolutely amazing. This is one of the many feats that helps revolutions put superman to shame.<br/><br/> For those who enjoy insulting the special effects and CGI in every movie they see, here are the basic details:<br/><br/> the effects are probably the best ever. the digital cinematography (the technology that made the 100-Smith burly brawl possible) from the second film is much more rare and yet used to greater effect. Every effect in the real world is jaw-dropping. Kudos to the people specifically behind the robots piloted by the humans. They looked amazing.<br/><br/> The script doesn't push itself TOO far from the story, but this turns out to be a good thing. Unlike Reloaded, it dodges the hordes of pretentious philosophy lessons and keeps only those necessary, plus adds some witty lines to the mix. The in-matrix action scenes are greatly reduced, thanks to the huge uber-battle over zion and a skirmish with bane. The kung-fu scenes present, however, are fabulous. Let me make this clear: the final battle with Smith is absolutely drool-worthy.<br/><br/> The matrix deserved four stars. Reloaded... about two and a half. Revolutions? back up to four. Between them, it forms a ""V"" shape. ""V"" for ReVolutions.<br/><br/>Yes that was cheesy as hell, and no i don't care. Because while i may have a terrible sense of humor, the final Matrix film didn't suck. It didn't suck a whole lot. And i am happy."

","I was surprised by Matrix Revolutions--the reviews I heard were so poor that I expected an utterly dismal conclusion to the trilogy.  The movie turned out to be surprisingly good as far as a conclusion to the story line built up in the past two movies.  It was not the most creative ending, and was somewhat predictable despite a few twists thrown in, but it was relatively satisfying.<br/><br/>Fight scenes are still fantastic; towards the beginning of the film is yet another lots-of- guns, lots-of-flying-cement fight sequence, but it's no less enthralling than the similar scene in the original Matrix.  Neo and Smith also can still engage in a captivating fight.<br/><br/>As many of the media reviews have said, the special effects are still spectacular, and though the climactic battle scene is very long, it actually did not seem too long, although the script was reduced to little more than screaming.<br/><br/>Matrix Revolutions is lacking quality as a cinematic work.  Despite a few amusing lines but various characters, most of the writing is poor, predictable, uninteresting.  How many times does Neo have to ask ""What does that mean?"" to have the Oracle say ""You know.""  And sadly, Neo sometimes just comes off as rather dense.<br/><br/>Finally, the religious undertones of the music are as clear is ever, and sometimes not even so hidden.  Of course the philosophical issues run rampant, from the first scene to the last (and be prepared to hear endless musings about love--it's everyone's [even all the programs'!] new obsession).<br/><br/>See Matrix Revolutions, it is worth it as the conclusion of the trilogy. The writing is bad, the dialogue sometimes downright ridiculous, but the special effects are still wondrous, and there's enough action without always being too predictable that it's worth the two hours."

","The Matrix (part I) can stand alone as a fine piece of cinema.  What made it good was the story, not the action.  While the action was excellent, it was only a part of the movie, not the entire movie.  The story had depth, the characters were interesting and dynamic; the action was a bonus that complemented the other aspects of the film.<br/><br/>Reloaded put too much emphasis on action.  The action sequences were extraordinary, but the story suffered as a result.<br/><br/>Revolutions is a complete waste of time.  It relies entirely on CG, has no story and an abysmal script.  The story was over after the first movie.  It looks as though the concept was purchased and then milked out into three movies simply to make as much money as possible.  They essentially took a excellent recipe and then watered it down to make it last as long as possible.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Revolutions will survive at the box office purely because of a fan base from the first movie.  The Matrix trilogy is a study in good marketing, not good film making.<br/><br/>The first Matrix is worth owning (with Revisited), but the two sequels are only worth renting -- if that.

","...but really, all that this series of movies is, is an update of the basic story that was first put forward in TRON. Seriously, think about it...<br/><br/>Neo = Tron (Bruce Boxleitner); Morpheus = Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges); Trinity = Yori (Cindy Morgan); The Source (whatever the giant floating head at the end of Revolutions was) = Master Control Program; Agent Smith Sark (David Warner)<br/><br/>And in both movies, there are two levels of reality; one exists in machines, one exists in the ""real world."" In both, one of the protagonists is forcibly extracted from one world into the other. In both is an inherently malevolent computer program that wants to take over the functions of all other programs. Seriously, go back and watch TRON (I recommend the 2-disc DVD set), and you'll see a disturbing number of parallels.<br/><br/>Now, onto my actual Revolutions review. First, this series was never intended as a trilogy. The evidence for this is both how amazingly weak the script is for Reloaded/Revolutions compared to The Matrix. Yeah, there was a lot of pompous dialogue in the first one, but at least it didn't grind the movie to a screeching halt. Also, character motivation changes completely from one to the next; i.e., Morpheus becoming so fatalistic, Neo suddenly being unsure of himself after ending the first one so confident, etc. Second, this movie scores about an 8.5 out of ten on the Unintentional Comedy Scale. Honestly, was anyone else laughing and wishing Trinity would just freakin' DIE already? Third, and the thing that I think annoyed me the worst: the Brothers Wachowski took what had to have been the most simplistic approach to ending the story that was humanly possible. Anyone who has said the movie made you think needs to put down the movie ticket and go read a freakin' book or two. This was not a deep movie by any stretch of the imagination, it has plot twists which can be seen a mile off, and has a script so ham-fisted in its imagery that I was embarrassed on behalf of the screenwriters. Deep would have been the idea (that I've seen in a few places) of the ""real world"" being another layer of the Matrix for those who reject the first. That, by the way, would also have explained a lot of other things a whole hell of a lot better than they actually wound up doing. Things like why Neo's powers work when he's not jacked in, how Smith can migrate between worlds, why it didn't really matter one way or the other if Zion was destroyed or not, etc, etc, etc...<br/><br/>Bottom line, I saw this strictly because I'd already seen the first two. I'm certainly not going to buy the DVD, and I'm really kind of sad that the legacy of these movies is going to be that of squandered opportunity. 4 out of 10 (This movie was OVERWHELMINGLY average)"

","The original MATRIX was a thoughtful film as much about society as it was an action film. When I heard they would be making these two sequels, I immediately wondered how they could tackle that aspect in a second film. The answer, they can't. The first film is about Neo discovering himself, and a freedom from restraint and rules. It was about living independently of 'the system' and not being a cog in the machine.  These two films deal simply from an action point of view most of the time, and the focus is on freeing humans and ending the war with the machines.<br/><br/>In REVOLUTIONS, Neo must travel to the machine city to face the enemy, while the others try to fend off the coming attack. Admittedly, more efficient story telling and elimination of some meaningless scenes and overly long special effect sequences could have broken these last two films down into one final chapter, but I guess there's less money in that.<br/><br/>Still, despite some wooden emotional sequences, this film is entertaining. I like the ending, and I don't think the film could have ended differently. Neo had to go off to face the Machines, even if it meant almost certain death. And, given the parallels drawn between ""the one"" and Christ, the end of the film is inevitable. Some of those on the site didn't like the end, but I don't see how it could have ended.<br/><br/>Bottom line: MATRIX was an untouchable 10 out of 10. REVOLUTIONS and RELOADED are probably somewhere between 6 and 7 out of ten. Good, not amazing. But how could it be otherwise."

So I had exactly NO hype for Reloaded when it came out, and when it did I was blown away, thus making the first film a much better movie for me as well.<br/><br/>It was inevitable that i would hype the third film to death after loving Reloaded so much. I downloaded every clip possible when it hit the net and had wallpapers on my computer backgroud of the Neo VS Smith fight.<br/><br/>Well, anyway. I saw the film twice in one day and enjoyed it both times. The ending leaves a lot of spaces where only opinion can be filled in unless the story is continued in some fashion, i just pray the Wachowskis do the writing or these three films meant nothing.<br/><br/>The Pacing on both Reloaded and Revolutions suffers a bit in the beginning, Reloaded more than Revolutions but on a personal level I feel the action sequences and the third films conclusion make up for it.<br/><br/>The special effects are amazing, sure the acting isn't top notch or oscar worthy but the movies in general, when they want to be, they are VERY entertaining. The music to the two of the most amazing fight scenes I've ever seen (The Burly Brawl and Super Brawl) add to the scenes making them epic and very memorable.<br/><br/>I think The Matrix is this generations Star Wars, but The Matrix has a reason to be known as a landmark film, for Star Wars only achieved beams of light, which sooner or later anyone in the film industry could have produced.<br/><br/>To sum it up, The Matrix is my favorite trilogy, the end to it all satisfied me because long afterwards I am able to say ""why did this happen and how?"" I don't wish for a sequel, and probably don't want the answers to all the questions the trilogy has raised, but overall I feel the films are very entertaining pieces of Hollywood work that will be etched in many peoples minds for a long time. The movie naturally has its fair share of flaws but if you just sit back and enjoy it (some may need a dictionary/thesaurus) and don't criticized how it could have been done, just marvel at how it has been done."

And I kept expecting Agent Smith to bust out a Terrance Stamp impression right before his inexplicable demise...""Kneel before me, Neo! Kneel before Zod!""<br/><br/>There's some nice moments during the Zion siege, but no genuine holy sh*t moments like the Morpheus Rescue or the Freeway Chase.<br/><br/>Going back a little bit to the second film, though...Where the hell did the guys who made Bound and The Matrix go?  Because Reloaded and Revolutions didn't LOOK like they were directed by the same guys...er...guy and girl...er...people.<br/><br/>I'd like to take a big, steamy dump on this film, because that's what it did to me during the final act."

","I find it hard to believe how many people seem to have hated this film. Perhaps they were expecting a big action-movie finish?  That would have been much more meaningless.  Although they did succumb to some clichés, I think the Wachowski brothers quietly proved in this last film that they really did have something important to say, and it has to do with these three words: choose, believe, and peace."
"arkanis50","8","0","0","8 November 2003"," It was inevitable. everything that has a beginning, has an end.
","The Matrix (1999) was an amazing movie, the sheer `what the hell?' factor of the first ten minutes of the movie alone will stick in my mind as one of my most enjoyable experiences at the movies. With the lackluster Reloaded (2003) following four years later, it was inevitable that this series of movies which has impacted on Western culture so greatly was going to come to an end. enter The Matrix Revolutions (2003).<br/><br/>After reading all the negative reviews and comments about Revolutions before having seen it, I walked out at the end of the movie thinking that these people should really stop hitting the crack-pipe before going to the cinema. To say Revolutions is a masterpiece that would rival Citizen Kane is obviously taking the piss, but I am amazed at how many people have mercilessly bashed this movie as if it were Gigli. I never pay much credence to professional movie reviewers, but rather the fans and average cinemagoers. I've heard of cases where professionals have reviewed this film without having even seen the original or sequel (they wouldn't have a clue what is going on)!<br/><br/>STORY: Revolutions picks up at the end of Reloaded and focuses on the sentinel attack on Zion, with very little of the action taking place inside The Matrix, approximately 25 minutes at the most. Some of the anger towards this movie seems to stem from this lack of focus on The Matrix, but rather the defense of Zion. Personally I don't care much for Zion, but I believe it was necessary in Revolutions to put much of the focus on Zion and the human faces of the conflict. I tend to agree with the analysis that Revolutions is much more of an `emotional' movie, as we explore and experience the myriad of emotions the Zion forces experience during the attack on Zion. Even the usually deadpan demeanors of Neo and Agent Smith are replaced with very human feelings and reactions - like rage, anger, love and loss. Since this is the final in the trilogy, you can expect a big finish with regards to Neo and Agent Smith, although Neo's fate my leave many with a bitter feeling.<br/><br/>
ACTING/DIALOG: Once again, Hugo Weaving (Smith) shines like a diamond in the rough compared to some of the other actors and characters around him. Even Reeves (Neo) manages to appear to be remotely `human' in some of his more dramatic scenes. Overall the acting was rather average, although some of the more important characters are on screen for so little in this film that often it is hard remember what they were like. The little Indian girl Sati I found rather annoying, given the fact she so often mispronounced names - calling Neo, Nero?. and other little things like that. I'm not sure if this was intention on her character's behalf, or what. Having said that, I must give a shout-out to Monica Bellucci's (Persephone) breasts, while only on screen for less than a minute, they certainly gave a great performance!<br/><br/>
As far as dialog goes, well the less said the better. While the cheesy one-liners and clichés didn't bother me as it did for some, much of the interesting/profound `psychobabble' which last littered through the first two movies wasn't anywhere to be found in Revolutions - I'll get back to this later on. Having said that, there was little time to see how deep the rabbit's hole went with the sentinel attack on their doorstep.<br/><br/>WHAT WORKED: The action scenes were amazing; something The Matrix series has always succeeded in achieving. The hundreds of thousands of sentinels pouring into the docks was amazing to watch, but ultimately it got very repetitive - it did peeve me that they could fire a million rounds from one APU before needing ammo. The fight in club Hell, while short was also a great scene in a movie where there was little Matrix action. Who can forget the `Super Brawl'? It was certainly over-hyped by the Joel Silver as far as I was concerned, with some flying scenes looking more like a battle from some rubbish like Dragon Ball Z. I did however find the scene where Smith and Neo run at each other in the rain with the music pumping to be a great scene as far as atmosphere and visual style goes. The Wachowski Brothers, or Wacker Bro's for short, have always had an amazing scene of visual style. it's a shame the story wasn't as polished - as you will find out in `what didn't work'. Also thumbs-up to Don Davis and co for a great score.<br/><br/>A big complaint with fans was the ending, I won't give it away, but I personally think it was the only true way to end the series. That said, the ending did seem to come rather quickly, and there could have been a bit more time spent on the Neo's fate. I'll applaud them for not taking the easy way out and going with your typical Hollywood ending - although could a series like The Matrix ever truly have a sappy Hollywood ending?<br/><br/>WHAT DIDN'T WORK: Much of the anger towards the movie more than likely comes from the fact that nothing was really explained. If you went into this movie expecting to have most of those niggling answers about `what is The Matrix' explained, then you will be bitterly disappointed. Practically nothing whatsoever about what the Matrix is, will be answered in this movie, if anything you will leave with more questions than answers. If you wanted to know more about Neo's powers in the outside world that had many internet chatrooms and Matrix forums alight after Reloaded, all you will get is a one-sentence cop-out muttered by the Oracle - disappointing.  I didn't expect all of the questions about The Matrix to be answered - a good movie should answer some of the questions, but ultimately leave you thinking about some of the unanswered questions long after you see it. Revolutions answered nothing.<br/><br/>While I'm discussing characters, so many of the great characters that Reloaded introduced us to, namely The Architect, Seraph, Persephone and The Merovingian barely see the light of day in Revolutions (pardon the pun). While Seraph gets into some entertaining gunplay towards the start of the movie, The Merovingian is barely in the film for five minutes -such a potentially layered and interesting character has been tossed aside. The Wachowski Brothers have baited so many hooks in the first two movies, that by the time the final movie ends, they don't have time to reel most of them in.<br/><br/>FINAL COMMENT: The Matrix was such a great movie; unfortunately the two sequels could never truly live up to the original. So many questions went unanswered, so many ideas and storylines went uncompleted - so sad. Revolutions is still an enjoyable movie, I certainly haven't taken to the streets and burnt effigies of The Wacker Bro's like some fans make out they have.<br/><br/>Matrix Revolutions - 8/10"

"lonerangerone","Null","0","0","8 November 2003"," Sequels Suck: Or Why the Latest Matrix Didn't Revolutionize Diddly
","Let me start by saying I am actually one of the minority who enjoyed Matrix Reloaded.  The first time I watched it, I was impressed by the visuals and the story seemed pretty strong, if a little wordy at times.  The one down point was the 15-minute Zionist orgy that was supposed to show us that Neo and Trinity (or is it `Trin'?) love each other - I suppose because they went away and did their lovemaking privately instead of in the crowd.  A few days later, thanks to the editors at Relevant, I was able to download, print out and digest The Architect's speech.  Being able to study it and then subsequently see the film again in the theatre, my esteem for The Wachowski Brothers went up dramatically.  It was clear to me during the second showing that the brothers had written an extremely tight film, with almost every line of dialogue pointing to what I saw as the ultimate conclusion.<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>Now I wouldn't mind this too much, if there had been given a more plausible solution to the situation.  The problem is, Revolutions basically ignores the question.  I won't get into particulars here, but suffice it to say that almost nothing we learned from The Architect and The Oracle in Reloaded has any bearing on what happens in Revolutions.<br/><br/>As an aspiring screenwriter and film buff, I know from experience that the best conclusion for a film is the obvious one that takes you by surprise. One of the best examples of this is the film Fallen, starring Denzel Washington, where they show you the end of the movie in the first ten minutes, despite which you still are kicking yourself two hours later for not seeing it coming.  I expected the same from Revolutions.  As I say, I wouldn't mind being wrong about the ending if it delivered on the promises on the first two films.  It just didn't.<br/><br/>I am a huge science fiction fan, with a little extra emphasis on the science.  I love seeing how writers and filmmakers explore and create new worlds, some based on our world, some with rules of their own.  But I hate, hate, hate it when they arbitrarily break the rules to make something work. The Matrix is supposedly set in a possible future on our earth.  Inside the Matrix there are rules that don't always jive with the real world.  That's okay, because we're told that it is a construct and everyone `in' the Matrix is basically a programmable subroutine based on the person's mind.  The exceptions are the Agents and people like The Oracle, The Merovingian (of is that the Frenchman?) and the Keymaker, who are programs designed by the machines to interact with the pseudo-humans.  No problems here.  However, it should be expected that outside the Matrix, in Zion and around the machine-dominated areas, normal physical laws should apply. Unfortunately, they don't.  I don't know if it is sloppy writing or last-minute late-night edits, but for some reason the EMP pulse doesn't work the same in Revolutions as it did in the last two films or as it is theorized to work real life.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, to give air to most of my rants about the problems with Revolutions, I would have to provide extensive spoilers, and I think enough critics on other online sites have done this.  Suffice it to say I was disappointed with the overall film and the open ending - you see, Matrix Revolutions is supposedly the third in a trilogy - but things could change (I suppose that has to do with money).<br/><br/>Would I recommend the movie?  Yes, I suppose.  Not at all for the reasons I recommended the original.  If you like action sequences and shoot-em-ups more in the style of the video game Quake than the John Woo-inspired sequences of the first film, you'll be right at home.  There is something horribly ironic about fighting machines with machines, and you'd think from the technology displayed in Zion they would have ended this a long time prior, but. Martial arts fighting buffs will also be impressed.  Hoping for some water cooler discussion material?  Try again.  I should say though that there are two strong stand-outs in the film.  Ian Bliss deserves props for doing a fantastic Hugo Weaving voice-impression.  And sadly, Monica Bellucci was apparently paid for displaying her considerable cleavage - her breasts have almost as much dialogue as she does, and twice as much screen time - hopefully she'll get to actually act in The Passion of Christ, rather than just being lewd eye candy.<br/><br/>Everything that has a beginning has an end - I just wish this had been a better one."

The fight should have been great, but instead of a cool, large scale Reloaded fight scene, or a one-on-one fight like the original, the fight scenes here used so many special effects that it really ruined the fight - you could hardly see what was happening most of the time, and the end to the fight made little sense.<br/><br/> As for the end of the film, what a load of garbage.

","After the first matrix i felt a sense of change in my overall outlook on life,it is a film of hope and belief.  The second film was disappointing, well to be honest what wouldnt have been after the modern classic that is the matrix.  Still i told myself that the second film was not a film but half of one and it seemed better.  Dont get me wrong the humour in it intended and otherwise and the action were first rate.  I saw it in a giant cinema of nearly 1500 people and the atmosphere was amazing.  However, the third film does exactly what i wanted it to, it entertained me and told a story.  What some people are forgetting when they say that there is no background narrative or indication of the plot it that these three films are not supposed to be seen as separate stories but as one whole saga.  The revolutions film ended these saga on a high note of hope and wraps up the franchise.  Think of the three as one and try to imagine a better trilogy. In my mind it beats the original star wars hands down and im a big fan of george lucas' baby. The matrix is to me more like Star Wars and the Lord of The Rings than say, Die Hard.  The stories are one split into three and not three separate plots.  The original will never be beaten but the third comes close.  I sat there and said WOW NOW I UNDERSTAND THE MATRIX CONCEPT. Go see it but see the others just before and remember that they are one! The one!"
"DocFun","9","0","0","9 November 2003"," Awesome and unsatisfying at the same time, they could have done with 2 movies
","May contain minor spoilers!<br/><br/> Yesterday I watched Matrix Revolutions at the IMAX cinema and was amazed and disappointed at the same time. First of all, IMAX is the way to watch this movie - it's the future of cinema. Not only is the image much bigger, also the image quality is far superior to conventional cinemas. (Actually when watching the IMAX version of Reloaded I spent more time counting the bumps in Fishburns skin than paying attention to the plot.) If you have the opportunity to watch it in IMAX, leave your PC now and do it!!!<br/><br/> Now for the movie, let's start with the positives:<br/><br/> The special effects are groundbreaking. Every once in a while there is a movie that delivers never before seen visual effects and goes into history for being ahead of it's time (in technical matters). The late 70s had Star Wars, the early 90s had Terminator 2, 2003 has Revolutions. The battle for Zion scene is the most amazing special effects scene I've seen so far. I thought with the common use of CG in many action movies today it was almost impossible to create something so amazing, it could reach this milestone status of the two movies mentioned above. But gladly the Wachowskis proofed me wrong. It's the new benchmark for all sci-fi action movies to come.<br/><br/>Effects-wise it's all I had hoped the new Star Wars movies or Terminator 3 would be.<br/><br/> Now for the bad things:<br/><br/> The big clarifying end I hoped for is missing. You'll easily leave the movie with even more questions unanswered than after the first two parts. This left me very unsatisfied. And the outcome of all this is that Reloaded is an obsolete movie. No character introduced in Reloaded and no plot parts were really necessary to reach this ending. With some minor adaptions in the beginning of the plot of Revolutions you easily could have done without the second part of the trilogy.<br/><br/>For example the Merovingian and all characters related to him are absolutely unnecessary. Yes, they provided for some nice special effect scenes, but cut out all of the subplot around him and it wouldn't change anything about the outcome of the trilogy.<br/><br/> So since I'm a fan of sci-fi action cinema I rate this movie 9/10 since it's a 2 hour audiovisual thrillride (even more in the IMAX).<br/><br/>If you're more interested in the philosophical aspects of the movie and were looking for answers you will be very disappointed. Also with the final scene the Wachowskis threw the door wide, wide open for another Matrix movie."

Where the first movie was subtle, intellectually challenging, and I felt sympathy for the characters and their situation, the third one is about as simplistic as any ""B"" science fiction/action movie.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is so stiff, that at his end, I could not tell if he was dying, in pain, ready to keep fighting, or in a trance.<br/><br/>There is no nuance, we don't feel compassion for our three main heroes, and there is no feeling of having experience a deeper understanding of the first two movies or of the underlying philosophies.<br/><br/>It was good to see a racially diverse set of actors.

So what everyone was assuming to be the real world was just another Virtual Reality layer, another illusion designed by the architect for containing the humans that are rejecting the matrix program.<br/><br/>The point of Revolutions is that it shows how Neo is gradually coming to understand that the ""real world"" is just another layer of the Matrix. Neo does not want to tell this to his fellow teammates, i.e. Morpheus, Trinity and the others because he has come to realize that they are not free of the Matrix, as they earlier thought.<br/><br/>The players who are conscious of this are the Architect, the Oracle and the 2 programmers and the little girl from the real ""real world"" that Neo meets at the train station and the Matrix' s source God that Neo comes face to face with in the end.<br/><br/>When you figure that out, everything in the 3 movies makes total sense."

","Story: A Acting: B Direction: A Visuals: A+ Overall Grade: A<br/><br/>Okay, first of all, I loved the first Matrix.  I couldn't wait for the next 2. BUT I did not see Reloaded in the theater because the critics and my friends told me it was terrible. I listened to them and ignored it all the way until last week when I reluctantly rented the DVD. Much to my bittersweet chagrin, I liked it. A lot. The action + special effects were awesome (in the true sense of the word), the story was fluid and the themes dealt with were relevant and intelligently handled (the major theme being free will vs. predestination and how love works out out within that apparently paradoxical framework). Excellently executed in a taut, thrilling, butt-kicking, name-taking rollercoaster ride of a movie. Good stuff.<br/><br/>First lesson learned: Movies are subjective. Everyone has different tastes. Your taste is not mine. I will never listen with absolute attention to a critic or my friends again. Of course, I will weigh their opinions and tack them on to my ""discretionary buffer zone"" before deciding to see a movie - but I will never make an absolute decision based on others opinions in matters of subjectivity again. Second lesson learned: Expectations suck. (Which is probably why the critics and my friends were let down with Reloaded)<br/><br/>Now, onto dealing with Revolutions...from my perspective:<br/><br/>After my unexpectedly pleasant encounter with Reloaded, I eagerly anticipated seeing Revolutions. This time around, critically speaking, the critics reviews were tougher and my friends expectations were once again shattered. They either *liked* it, mildly disliked it or hated it. All were disappointed by it. Hmmm...what was I to think? I learned my lesson after seeing Reloaded...this time around I was going to ignore them and go into it with no expectations. I decided to let the story take me where it was going instead of me having a preconceived idea as to where I 'expected' it to go. I just saw it. I LOVED it.<br/><br/>First lesson reinforced: Critics suck. I can't fully trust my friends' judgments ever again. Second lesson reinforced: Drop expectations (of a subjective nature of course...moral expectations are a different ball game). Sometimes when it comes to judging film, instead of letting the storytellers take us on a journey, we become the backseat drivers. We kick and scream, begging the driver to change his/her course because it's not where we wanted to go. I surmise that this could be the reason that most folks disliked Revolutions. They jumped into the car wanting to go somewhere else.<br/><br/>
Now Revolutions was definitely a change of atmosphere and pacing in comparison to the previous two. In this movie, most of the story took place in either ZION or a spacecraft. The feel of this movie reminded me of ALIENS (Alien 2)...dark and at times creepily suspenseful. And unlike the first Matrix and Reloaded, the filling isn't comprised of mind-blowing special effect laced - reality-defying kung-fu action sequences. Instead, the action, however quantified, is INTENSE in a different way. Replacing the usually ever-present hand-to-hand combat is a craaazy techno-war between the humans and machines with an insane amount of bullets being fired. FUN. Furthermore, for the first time in this trilogy, I felt a genuine sense of fear. I actually feared for the lives of the characters faced with imminent death. The Wachowski's did a tremendous job portraying courage in times of absolute terror...which is a large part of the movie. And the ending...wow...now this is RIDICULOUSLY COOL. Neo and Agent Smith duke it out for the last time. I must say that this is the BEST fight scene depicted in the trilogy (again...in my opinion). I left the theater very satisfied.<br/><br/>
For many, the depth of philosophical exploration in the Matrix series was not adequate enough. I disagree. Although I concede that I did leave the theater with some questions still unanswered (ontological in nature), the simple truths brought out by this series WERE more than enough for me. Revolutions was a terrific compliment to the previous two, ending the series brilliantly - tying together the loose strings Morpheus, Trinity and the people of Zion were anticipating. Simplicity is often very profound. Faith. Hope. Courage. Love. Hate. Life. Death. Choice. Fate. These are the concepts the Matrix tautly grappled with - and with boldness like no other film I have ever seen. Simple concepts...yet each with significant relation to our core existence.<br/><br/>Now, the movie did end kind of open-ended. We weren't really given complete answers to everything. Well...I hypothesize that the Wachowski bros. left our questions insufficiently answered for a purpose. Not that they want us to believe there is another movie coming that will seek to offer further explanation, but they want us to choose what we believe. Maybe they want us to take the journey Neo and the others took instead of telling us plainly. If all the questions were answered, we wouldn't have to think. Now that would be a shame. Hmmmm...could it be? It's possible. :)<br/><br/>10/10 (a 10 is a rarity from me)"

","The cast and crew did an excellent job with the end of the Matrix series. I enjoyed the film emmencly.  I only had two problems with the film, and that is the purpose of the little girl in the story, and the fact that you don't know for certain if Neo is dead.  Either way the directing duo did well by the presedence they've established with the release of the first film. The critics don't know jack, for the Matrix series has always remained a science fiction film that tells a great story.  The fight sequences weren't over done, because this film has humanity facing its ultimate destruction. This finale chapter in the Matrix trilogy was well told.

","Having just walked out of the theatre, I can only say this movie is a disappointment.  After Reloaded, I was hoping for....something.  What I did see was a very pretty CGI fest that reminded me of the longest video game introduction ever. Dialogue was corny, ideas were muddled, and most of the action was just overdone or recycled.<br/><br/>The first Matrix movie was fresh, it had great philosophy, it had man vs machine, good vs evil, reality vs theory, etc.  What did the second two add? All new philosophy slopped on your plate like a cafeteria lunch lady (and just as unappealing), enough graphics to make your eyes water, and a shipload of characters hyped up and simply left as window-dressing with little to do in the movie except give the illusion of evil (without really DOING anything).<br/><br/>When I got to the ""climatic"" fight between Neo and Smith, I laughed. It was silly, childish, and completely overdone, as something out of Power Rangers or a Saturday cartoon. It was not mind-blowing or awe-inspiring, or evoking of any emotion, except for maybe disbelief. The sort of why-oh-why disbelief.<br/><br/>And I do resent the posts that say anyone that does not like this movie has limited intellect and simply ""didn't get"" the idea. My intellect is fine, thank you very much, and I don't need a movie to gauge it for me.<br/><br/>I voted this movie a 4/10 because the idea was okay, nothing new, some of the war scenes were well done, and because no one throws a sneer like Hugo Weaving."

This movie is not worthy to have been made by the Wachowski brothers. I believed Reloaded was the worst of the series and that Revolutions would certainly make up for it, but no Revolutions was cheesy, poorly plotted and the effects weren't any better than in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.

"ldreamr","Null","0","0","8 November 2003"," A different perspective
","Ninety percent of the reviews here seem to be pretty negative. A lot of people seem to think that the first movie was the best, the second movie not as good, and the third movie crap. There are a lot of complaints about bad acting, overly drawn out battle scenes, ""all action and no plot,"" no breakthrough special effects, but also ""boring philosophy"" and ""stupid dialogue"" and an ending that is ""outright ridiculous.""  And of course the whole lack of originality and cheesiness thing.<br/><br/>I am not in the habit of becoming attached to movies or of defending them, but I felt strongly enough about this trilogy to write something. Because what I got out of it was an affirmation of the spiritual nature of reality -- which is, after all, what mythology is intended to do. Myths and legends tell timeless stories in ways that people can relate to, and remind us of fundamental truths, and Matrix movies are definitely mythic. And myths aren't new, in fact they're very old; but I don't hear anyone complaining that any new production of King Lear lacks originality because it rehashes the same material. In science fiction, the Matrix's ideas have been presented before -- many times in written form, a few times on film or TV (e.g. Dark City). Of course it's not original.<br/><br/>I believe that movies like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and The Matrix touched people not because of good acting, action, or special effects, but they are stories that are both human and larger-than-life, and underlying those stories are mythical themes that remind us of our spiritual nature: good and evil, purity and corruption, the tangible and the intangible, the practical and the magical. And in science fiction, there are more contemporary themes: human and nonhuman, cold reasoning and human feeling. All of this is the genuine depth that I love about good science fiction and fantasy, and that depth is something that popular culture desperately needs.<br/><br/>
So what I see in these epic movies is that affirmation of magic in our lives. And I liked the entire Matrix trilogy because it speaks of reality as a complex, perhaps incomprehensible existence which is guided by awareness and choice. There are clear Judeo-Christian analogues but they are truths that are equally compatible with ideas from other spiritual systems, Buddhism for one.<br/><br/>All spiritual paths teach that the way to freedom is love -- in different language, different forms: salvation, peace, emptiness. The only true fulfillment is to love oneself totally, to know oneself as a complete being, both completely empty and completely full -- whether by becoming ""enlightened"" or by living with Jesus in your heart -- and thereby become free to act in accordance with one's deepest nature, nonattached or inaccessible to any other influence. That's what I think the Matrix movies were trying to say, in their own small way. And I am mightily impressed that the makers of those movies succeeded in saying it, flawed though the movies are.<br/><br/>Of course that's not all the Matrix movies were about.  They were definitely about fight scenes and special effects.  They definitely had some not-so-great acting and editing.  Maybe there was just a bit too much money and PR thrown around out there.<br/><br/>But you get what you concentrate on.  Personally I'm looking for affirmation somewhere out there in the mainstream world, which is often banal and superficial and lacking in spiritual depth.  I think that stories both remind us of who we are and also stretch us in unexpected directions.  I suppose you could say that stories reflect a person's reality and where he or she is willing to go. I would guess that the first Matrix did a good job of reflecting people's distaste for and rejection of a boring, mundane, superficial pseudo-reality, but that the sequels did not. That may be one reason people liked them less: because they didn't affirm people's realities as well.<br/><br/>But I, personally, was very impressed by what this trilogy had to say. You won't find it in ninety percent of the other action films out there."
"kz7","7","0","0","8 November 2003"," Very much like part 2
","Ok, to start: the first Matrix was a classic - no doubt about it. The second was watchable but nothing too remarkable. Third part (Revolutions) is very much the same as the second: only a sequel. In the first Matrix you see lots of one-on-one fighting even when fighting a group. In the second part there's still the hand-to-hand combat only with one man versus large group. In the third part it's almost entirely groups. There's no ""slowing down"" like the second had with the Architect but one thing they should have realised is not to use too many closeups: there's many places where you see flashes of something happening but before you can grok what it was it's already gone - I call it the ""American Directing And Cutting"" -syndrome. The same problem was even more annoying in Jet Li films like Kiss of the Dragon or The One - only those movies had less capable directing. If you've seen parts 1 & 2 already you're probably going to see this anyway. If you haven't seen those parts there's not much point in watching only this part. Let's hope the Matrix trilogy ends here - otherwise we'll see crappy sequels like Alien Resurrection."

","The Matrix is obviously one of the greatest films of all time, so when the Wachowski Brothers decided to make it into a trilogy, people were obviously looking forward to two more great movies.  Yet no trilogy in existence has three movies that equal each other in greatness.  So why people expected two more classics, I'll never know.  Neither The Matrix Reloaded nor The Matrix Revolutions are classics, but both are good movies, although very different.<br/><br/>
All that said, The Matrix Revolutions deserves more praise than the very little it has received.  This movie, as is each movie in the Trilogy, is visually stunning.  The attack on Zion could not have been filmed better. Beyond that, however, I also thought the script was well-written.  It contains, as in each movie in the trilogy, deep lines that, even if they don't make sense, make you think.  Some have said this movie is slow, but I tend to disagree.  The Matrix is not meant to be brainless action, and Revolutions doesn't provide it.  Also, some say this movie leaves too many loose ends, but Reloaded should be blamed for providing too many story lines.  I believe the Architect should have been left out of both movies. The part I probably enjoyed the most, however, even beyond the special effects, was the score during the final showdown between Agent Smith and Neo.  The movie is worth seeing just for that.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I wouldn't be surprised if another Matrix is released maybe 5, 10, 15 years from now.  But until then, I highly recommend this movie as a good finale to an awesome trilogy."
"wiseman512","7","0","0","9 November 2003"," Great Action Flick, but not as amazing as the first!
","The Matrix Revolutions is mainly an action flick, with probably the most spectacular SFX that hollywood has ever seen!This is what we can call an action packed flick. Don't expect a lot of philosophical dialogue like the one with the arquitect...I believe this movie should have had new dialogues instead of the old sayings that we're so tired of listening to.<br/><br/>
SPOILERS!<br/><br/>
The Hall scene after the elevator was very similar to the one when Neo&Trin try to save Morpheus in the first matrix. I didn't like the ""new"" oracle, gloria's speech seemed a lot more consistent. The final fight between neo & smith was terrific, like the dark side vs the ""good"" side. Remember obi-wan :""If you kill me, I'll become more powerful than you can imagine"", and it did. The love story in the middle is in my opinion ridiculous and should have been reduced. The scenes are not as long as they were in the Matrix Relo, thank god!No more LECTURES from the frenchman nor from the arquitect!Surprisingly, keanu&carrie had a substantial reduction of screen time, probably because of the fight in zion. You basicly only get to see them in the last 30 minutes. I don't think anyone likes the final scene...with sati and the sun...c'mon...they could have come up with something better!the death or deaths(we don't know what happens to neo) of main characters were good for the movie and took the movie into another level, surely not met by any other blockbusters out there. I've read lots of reviews saying this movie sucked big time, but after seeing it I wasn't that disappointed. It's actually a pretty entertaining movie, lacking in philosophy, but still a lot better than any other sci-fi flick out there. 8 out of 10"
"loandreu","Null","0","0","8 November 2003"," Revolutions: disturbing and grim ending
","Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>I just saw Revolutions, and came out of the theater with one word in my mind: disturbing. Of course, ""disturbing"" is just a word when you are raking in the millions. By the way , since when a word's definition can save you from answering further questions about the reality behind the word? Of course ""love"" is a word, and so is ""an attachment to other people, blah, blah"" (whatever smart definition they give of love in the movie). Duh!  But still, if I was  Neo, I would ask  ""How come you computer programs feel attachment to each other"".  And I further whant to ask, how come computer programs have children? Perhaps I am missing some piece of informations that has been lost either in the movie or outside of it. But never mind, this is not why I was writing here. I'll cut to the chase. The ending of the Matrix is disturbing and grim for many reasons. In order to understand them, one has to understand that the first Matrix was an epiphany. Humanity, relegated to the bowels of the earth for centuries (no human being there has ever seen the sun, lucky Trinity), had a hope after all, namely The One. Now, I am a real human being, and if the machines have usurped my Earth, and I come accross The One, do I stop at making peace with the machines? To hell with peace. Let's destroy the crap out of them! Neo has the power to destroy machines with the flick of a finger. He has just started to tap his powers. Let him go back to Zion and burn the hell out of any borers and whatnot the machines have to send. Let him do the work. Hard? You bet! But let him stay human, for god's sake, not just turn into another machine. When the movie ends, there are many disturbing aspects of what is left that cannot but be considered despairing for both the viewers and the actual inhabitants of Zion: 1. Life on earth for the humans continues being a hell on earth, being relegated to a small colony away from our origins. 2. The machines keep ruling the earth, you know, the nice little earth we have grown so accustomed to, with flowers and rabbits, clouds and rivers, sun and birds. Earth is gone, and so is any chance of getting it back. 3. The matrix stays intact; the human/batteries stay in place. Nice for the machines, not so good for humanity. 4. Neo is gone, and so is any advantage that humans could have inside of the matrix and out. C'mon, let the One be the One, not just a powerless messenger who can only destroy a stupid computer program within thye Matrix (Smith). Smith is just a program in the Matrix. He is nothing. Destroy the machines, and you'll destroy the matrix. 5. Trinity is gone, there goes the cool looks for Zionites. I wonder what Morpheus is going to do now. Poor wretched fellow, nobody to match his wardrobe. 6. Both the Architect and the Oracle are big, self-preserving machine liars at the end. Especially the Oracle, just another piece of software at the service of sentient machines. She is even worse than the Architect, I tell you. All that mushy talk, but she is the one who realizes that the machines have no chance to win against Neo, and that's why she guides him towards his utltimate pointless efforts for peace (peace is better for machines than for humans here). Like she has done humans any big favor. I would have chosen Smith, to be frank. Some real quasi-human piece of software, he was. He could have even turned to be an ally of the humans, who knows... And why is a piece of software the only being on earth who knows how to make chocolate chip cookies anymore? Is hope so lost? So there. Not that the original Matrix was an example of unbreakable logic and premises without fault (not even formal mathematics can explain itself these days). For one thing, to keep human/batteries alive to feed the machines, it follows that the machines need to feed the humans. Who does not know that there is not machine with a 100% energy output? Every machine loses energy in the process of generating it.  More so a human being. Smart way for machines to waste energy. Anyway, as a corollary, I expect the upcoming  Return of the King to surpass Revolutions hands down, as trilogies go. For one thing, you can always go back to the book and see where they screwed up, always there with Tolkien, ready to give you hope. Not so with the Wachowskis. So I'll give it 5/10"

","This movie was just right.  If you consider what this trilogy is about, you couldn't ask for much more.<br/><br/>Considering most triquels of decent triologies:  Return of the Jedi, Godfather 3, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade we need be greatful.  The machines don't turn out to be fuzzy teddy bears, nor does Zion seek out the warm fuzzies to rally around.  Keanu didn't return when he was 50 to finish the roll, and it's not a series of short stories.<br/><br/>Revolutions successfully answers all questions without being a gambit simply for profit.  The Wac brothers cannot introduce concepts as large as the Matrix in the triquel.  It took 3 movies just for the original concept. So awe inspiring Matrix epiphanies are not the order of the day.  The only mission Revolutions can accomplish is to answer the questions, settle the debts and yet still try to be as hypnotizing as the first two.<br/><br/>It does this excellently.  There are no short cuts.  It's shot and paced with the same respect as the first two.  It perfectly caps off the pyramid of the triology.  My favorite character is the Oracle's bodyguard, Seraph. Only his third flick apparently.  Good for him.<br/><br/>It's as visually mesmerizing as the first two.  I didn't give it a 10 because there's some items that flashbacked to other movies and thus distracting from the movie.  At one point theres a scene where you swear John Williams (Star Wars) was composing the movie and it appears the Star Wars theme is playing.  Parallel to Princess Leia and Luke/Han on the Ewok bridge talking about sibling relations.  Even the lighting/hues are similar. The fight scene on the end made me think of Superman (1978) and the battle at the end with the villains in leather.  Of course this is shot 25 years later and is incredibly done.  You can't help but think of the Millennium Falcon and Lando in the Death Star exit of Return of the Jedi.  And actually both are done equally well.  Kudos to ILM (1983).<br/><br/>So I liked it and look forward to seeing it again.  I saw nerds on the way out tell me they were discussing the philosophical revelations of Revolutions.  I don't think you'll be able to go this deep.  It couldn't introduce anything heavy and solve it in the same movie with all the other items to wrap up.<br/><br/>Like the first two, I believe it is intertwined.  You can look forward to rewatching the first two yet again and drawing out more revelations.  I think in time this will become the 21st century Star Wars, or even perhaps, the original Star Wars may be known as the 20th century Matrix?"

However, you may find yourself, as I did, enjoying the movie even more as time passes after it ends. The ending may seem sudden and severe, but in retrospect, anything further would have only created more questions.<br/><br/>Revolutions, however, does not answer EVERY question one might have. It's a movie that is deserving of the reviews it has received. Revolutions has received reviews both negatively and positively and in the middle, and all are equally worthy of consideration.

"rick3me","8","0","0","8 November 2003"," A Very Worthy Conclusion
","I will briefly discuss this film on merits inherent to spoilers.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions rewards investment.  It carries the thematic arcs and plotlines introduced in it's two predecessors, as well as the short films The Second Ranaissance parts One and Two and Kid's Story, to a worthy conclusion.  I feel the general reaction that there ""is so much just left unanswered"" and ""the ending doesn't make sense"" is a sad, sad statement regarding today's general moviegoing audience, as by paying just a little bit of attention to ANYTHING to do with the movie would answer these questions.<br/><br/>For instance, a common question is ""what was with the ending of the last fight?""  Well, I don't know how much more heavy-handed that could have been, and still so many people missed it: the theme of balance, of yin-and-yang was brought to total fruition in that fight.  As the Oracle (played to perfection by Mary Alice--Gloria Foster, had she been in this film, would have played it the same) tells Neo that he and Smith are opposites, the negatives of eachother, the result of ""the equation trying to balance itself.""  When they take to the air, they even fly at eachother in a yin-yang pattern.  As long as one exists, they will both be struggling against one another.  As long as one is there, the other must be.  That is the nature of balance: they are both there, or they are neither there. So, Neo allowed himself to be eliminated, and so without his counterpart, without his purpose, Smith could no longer exist either.  Heck, the oracle was even wearing Yin-Yang earrings.<br/><br/>The Oracle appearing at the end fight:  It was established that when Smith overtakes someone, he still retains a part of their memory (established when he quotes Sati though he had no way of hearing her).  So, the Oracle allowed herself to be overtaken, thus allowing her to speak to Neo (near the conclusion of Smith's AWESOME monologue on the breakdown of signifyer and the signified and perception of purpose), telling Neo ""exactly what he needed to hear"" to figure out what needed to be done.<br/><br/>But I digress.  This film answers EVERY question raised by Reloaded (the rave was meant to draw parallels between the humans and the machines that are ""like them, free, apparently,"" and Hamman's creepy little speech was to set up that maybe humans are starting to recognize that the codependance they walked away from in Second Renaissance is the best way to go).<br/><br/>It is not without it's flaws, though: much of the dialogue was sub-par, but how is that different from any other film in the series?  Also, Trinity's death scene was ALMOST as drawn out and hammy as Yoda's, but not quite. The only loose ends are: what happened to the twins (though we could assume they were deleted after failing)? and How was Tank the brother of Dozer and Zee when he is of a COMPLETELY different racial background than they are?  To me, these are two forgivable loose ends for a trilogy that sought to take standard popcorn-action fair and inject it with Bhuddist, Christain, and Hindu theology and some rudimentary philosophy.  If you want a completely satisfying action flick where you don't have to pay attention to themes and theory, then xXx2 is coming out sometime soon.  If you want a more honest theological/religious experience, pick up a Bible.  If you want deeper psychology, go to a book store, or sign up for a 101 class at a local community college."

","In understanding the Matrix Trilogy, as I like to refer to all three films, you must be aware of the presence of themes. Themes are vital aspects of moviemaking and the Matrix Trilogy is full of themes. The most overwhelming themes that connect the three films are as follows:<br/><br/>The Matrix (1999) is about ""birth."" The Matrix Reloaded (2003) is about ""life."" The Matrix Revolutions (2003) is about ""death.""<br/><br/>It's a very neat way to connect the three films. Unfortunately, these themes also foreshadow something about their respective films.<br/><br/>For The Matrix (1999), the theme is birth and, accordingly, this film is an achievement in moviemaking as only can be done through the birth of something. This film introduced such an original idea and a powerful story, with characters that made you yearn for more. Story and performances aside, the special effects were groundbreaking and still remain at the forefront of what movies accomplish today. When something is ""born,"" everything looks great. Everything looks new and exciting.<br/><br/>For The Matrix Reloaded (1999), the theme is life and, accordingly, this film carries on the way life does for us all. It becomes more complicated and if possible, less interesting. This film offered nothing terribly new or different in special effects, and while the performances were generally the same, the story was the only place for it to really go. The story read like stereo instructions, and while after several more viewings it became more clear, the simplicity that the first film had to offer was gone. One highlight was the new characters such as The Twins, the Merovingian, Seraph and (ooh-la-la) Persephone.<br/><br/>For The Matrix Revolutions (2003), the theme is death and, accordingly, death is the suckiest part of anything and it is also the one thing we know least about. This film tried too hard and really made very little sense. The Oracle, who was played very well by an actress who's name I don't know, was as vague and useless as ever. Smith proved to be great once more but his fate (which I won't mention) really came out of nowhere. Morpheus is getting old (figure of speech) and Neo is becoming even more borish with his ""I am stupid to the world"" look. Another part of this film that dragged me down was the amount of time spent in the real world. It doesn't say much about humanity (the depth to the real world characters is weak) and the setting just isn't interesting enough. Ultimately, the Matrix is where it is all settled, so why spend so much time in the damn real world. What Neo was supposed to do or meant to do became lost amid the neverending action. Neverending I tell you. The effects stood above anything I've ever seen, but the true kicker to The Matrix Trilogy is supposedly its story. And while humanity may or may not have won out in this film, I am sad to say that the story suffered drastically. A real downer, followed by massive confusion, at the end, however, was a nice touch.<br/><br/>After three films, I've made a decision:<br/><br/>I'd much rather live in the Matrix than in Zion. Things are less complicated in the Matrix. Ignorance is not bliss, but confusion just ain't my bag baby.<br/><br/>p.s. Wachowski Brothers, don't tell me that even you understand what happened at the end. I leave it to you."

","I recently viewed The Matrix Revolutions and didn't feel like i got jipped for my money.  Then again, after The Matrix Reloaded, my expectations weren't too high.  After the cliff-hanger ending, and the final stand-off between Neo and Agent Smith, i just had to see how it all ends.  I can't help but compare the last two movies to the original.  They are, in fact, part of a trilogy.  But in the first one, not a single thing was over or underdone.  The action sequences had events as well as anticipation leading up to them.  The dialog sucked you in and nothing seemed plastic.  The Matrix Reloaded was more like a video game with (i'm a guy but i still think this way) too much action.  Although, Reloaded was not that bad a sequel. Then came Revolutions.  It seems as if written and directed by completely different people.  No longer did i feel any emotion towards the characters (even Smith lost his appeal).  Then out of nowhere, the big climatic battle scene.  The Neo and Agent Smith fight was a big air show (although there was one really cool slow motion shot towards the end of it).  The bottom line, if you really have to know how The Matrix Series will come to an end, watch the movie, it will provide the clarity that you've been waiting months for, just don't expect original or even Reloaded-level entertainment. 5/10"

","Hardly the worst science fiction film ever, The Matrix Revolutions is simply clichÃ©.  At least it can be laughed at.  In fact, I had MST3K-style commentary going through my head from the first scene forward.<br/><br/>Except for Agent Smith, the Wachowski brothers failed to write dialog worth hearing.  The question-answer cadence has all the freshness of Plato's dialogues yet lacked the philosophical depth.  It's been done before. It's been done better.<br/><br/>Actually, the film's only saving grace is Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. He makes an excellent villain.  Too bad Reeves' Neo comes across as just another hackneyed hero and not worthy of such an antagonist.<br/><br/>Stylistically, the scenes within the Matrix keep the original's essence but do little to expand it.  Scenes outside the Matrix are everything that can be expected of high-budget, postcyberpunk, cinema scifi.  When will an innovative futuristic battle sequence ever be filmed?  The open-cockpit robots standing firm against waves of attackers would be tactically foolish today.  The fight lacked substance and had all the style of middling mecha anime.<br/><br/>Thinking of anime, as the directors certainly do, I hoped that the final Neo v. Smith fight would at least be a good ride.  Instead it was best fight Dragon Ball never had.  I kept waiting for Neo to shout ""Kamehameha!""

I mean c'mon everyone, it had everything from action to love, sci fi to fantasy, but the most crucial element....it was all wrapped up and delivered in an old but fantastic storyline....love conquers all.<br/><br/>And they delivered it brilliantly, it satisfied all of us. From geek to stud, we all loved it. Neo became a God and we whooped in his awesomeness.<br/><br/>So what happened???<br/><br/>Regardless of what we all say, the ending not the lead up let us down...reloaded left it balanced on a knife edge...this way or that which way is it going to fall?<br/><br/>I will not try to whip a dead dog back to life, I can only give you what I had hoped would be the answer....that Neo would reproduce what he did in the first and go on to be even more than just a bullet stopper, more than having to actually fight anymore. That he would become the embodiment of human evolution and stun the machine world by showing human development at its best. I thought they touched on that with the ending of the sequel by showing his powers develop into the real world. I thought that regardless of all the plot this and that, he would rise to find a new found power that made him the ultimate god who beat the crap out of everything with a mere thought. The original left us with that feeling slightly and I just wished they had Neo come unto an even powerful understanding of it all. I mean he couldve been the one stage of human evolution that said ""all right, this has gone on long enough and I have had enough""<br/><br/>I for one wouldve just liked to have seen him come unto a power, maybe caused by Trinity's death that turned him into an almighty God that maybe even assimilated the source after raising his hand to Smith in that 15 minute battle scene and saying ""NO"" before deleting his ass of the planet. Then back into the real world where he lifts of into the air chasing the source around before assimilating it and controlling the machine world once and for all. A shot of him lifting Trinity into his arms and flying her back to Zion with all the squiddies making a path of defeat and respect for him as he goes. (C'mon its a movie guys)A quick trip back to the architect sees him making good on the ""hope we dont meet again thing "" and a finale in the matrix with all the team and him re making things into bliss for all those who survived programs and humans living in peace...with the final shot of him and a now living trinty flying into the distance.<br/><br/>Or something like that...beautiful!"

","I believe this ending to the Matrix saga was more then adequate for an ending, but still after seeing reloaded my expectations grew for this movie. Reloaded was an intriguing movie which raised the bar on the question of ""What really is real?"". Actually if Revolutions were a stand alone movie we would have expected a new trilogy, if The matrix and the sequel did not exist everybody here would have commented on how the movie was groundbreaking in many ways. Matrix trilogy's biggest fault was it started with such a great movie no one should expect anything but a downfall. The downfall has not occured. I believe Wachowski brothers created something more then a movie with this ending. They created a puzzle which has different outcomes for different minds. THE MATRIX TRILOGY IS A MOVIE YOU COMPLETE not one that is given to you like any other movies. You have to fill in the blanks with your imagination. I believe although if wachowski brothers gave the answers it might have been a complete film but without these answers the movie is like a book you can understand and complete it with your own imagination.<br/><br/>

It left me thinking that they should have just left it with the first and stopped.  Needless to say, I was _very_ skeptical about the 3rd one.  I was, however, pleasantly surprised.  Yes, they could have left it with the first one, and it would have been a great movie.

","Why do you do it? Why get up? Why keep fighting?<br/><br/>Why did the Wachowski brothers do it? I guess some people just don't see when they have something good, and go to every length to try and make it better. In my opinion, and in the opinion of many other IMDb users I see, the first Matrix was, for lack of a better word, perfect. The first time I saw Reloaded I thought it was just as good as the first installment, but now that I think of it, having seen Reloaded for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time...Im starting to realise that the only reason I liked it so much was because I was starved of such a film between 1999 and 2003, and appreciated whatever was given to me! Who knows, maybe if Revolutions was released in say another 6 months, it may have had a more positive impact on the audience (on the true Matrix fans at least). Is it only me, or do others also feel the need for a 4th part to this...erm...trilogy? When the end credits started rolling, I still sat there in the theater thinking...""Ok, this can't be the end...!"" The Wachowski brothers needed over 5hrs of film to show the audience what happens in the Matrix within a mere 24hrs and in all that time STILL managed not to answer some very important questions, like what happens to some of the main characters of Revolutions after the last scene! I came out of that cinema having more questions, than I had when I went in 2 hrs earlier!<br/><br/>Despite all of the above...I think its worth seeing the film, for three reasons: 1)the effects (most, but not all) are quite mind boggling! 2)the soundtrack is fabulous 3)to learn what concluding parts of really good films should NOT look like!<br/><br/>Oh and just to finish off... does anyone else agree that there could have been a more adequate title for this film eg. ""Zion"" or ""The Real World"" because.... I really didn't see too much of The Matrix in there!<br/><br/>Im waiting for part 4!"

","There's nothing disastrous about Matrix Revolutions. I'm a big time science fiction nutt and if it has to do with space or the future and its a movie, then i'm going to see it. It's that freaking simple.<br/><br/>When the Matrix came out, a lot of us scifi geeks went out to see it right away, and of course we loved it. As it turned out, a lot of people who don't consider themselves to be fans of scifi went to see it after hearing the good reviews and *gasp* THEY liked it too. Word of mouth helped the original Matrix become a blockbuster... more than just a cult classic.<br/><br/>The result? Matrix is a franchise and sequels II & III get released to an inaugural audience that is no longer predominantly made up of scifi geeks.<br/><br/>Speaking as a scifi geek, I feel that all three of these Matrix movies are independently better than 90% of the scifi movies that have ever been made. As far as i'm concerned, each Matrix movie is better than all three of the Next Gen cast Star Trek movies, and better than the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.<br/><br/>In many respects, what has happened with Revolutions is similar to what has happened to Kill Bill. Kill Bill wound up attracting a lot of people who wanted to see another ""Pulp Fiction."" Naturally those people were going to be disappointed. If you go to every movie made by your ""favorite"" director irrespective of the theme and subject matter of the film, there's no possible way that you can expect to enjoy every movie he cranks out.

","Deep down I know that the Matrix Revolutions is a good movie because it excites me to think about it. Ironic maybe because the more I think about it the more I like it. It hits us with ideas that the end is near because everything that begins must end, but in some ways it seems to breathe more life in its paradoxical conclusions than the first movie did with its cultural references. 	But it is not the best film in the trilogy because even though there is artistic poetry in the final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith, the Matrix Revolutions seems to forget its mass audience. At some point we see a transition from the self-professed philosophy of Reloaded, spawned from real philosophies and other cultural impacts, into a method in believing that we must fight for the end with our honour, our valour, and our pride. But the Wachowski Brothers get away with it because they have so much already invested in these characters that they were bound to succeed.<br/><br/>	Yet the Matrix Revolutions is not simply a nice looking action picture. It focuses its story more on human connections in comparison to machines as Neo awakens in a place somewhere between the real world and the Matrix. After being saved by his comrades he talks to the Oracle who speaks prophecies that could be expected from a psychic at a Star Trek convention.<br/><br/>	This lends Neo with the impression that he must venture to the machine world on his own because there he will find what the fate of human kind depends on. Far and wide between these ideas lies an immensely long action sequence with minimal cuts in relentlessness and no interwoven notions of Neo's state. 	But it still answered some of my questions. And even when it felt the need to sway from an explanation I didn't mind because the new questions left in the open were just as fascinating as the answers to the old ones. Then ending on a note of such curiosity that if a fourth film were made I would not watch it because coincidence does not merit an explanation. <br/><br/>	This is a film that hinted at ideas, more fully explored in graphic detail in Darren Aronofsky's cult masterpiece Pi.  In Pi, conscious decisions were made with prime material that this film didn't have room for due to mentioned action sequence of epic proportion. 	The hint in Revolutions that coincides with Pi is in that every human action is based on a code and that we need machines to be the mathematicians that our minds can't allow us to be. That film was kind of an elaborate set up for a look into a man's limit to his own sanity. This one speaks in tongues that show the better part of a grade eleven math course finally doing itself some good. 	The belief stems to say that every equation has equal opposition between worlds. In a mathematical sense, the figures that exist on both sides of the equal sign (parallel worlds) are, in turn, the same information, only presented in different forms. For example the number three could be opposed as being six divided by two in another universe making it the same power in a different identity. 	That's where the Matrix comes in. It was a system designed to balance the equations. The Architect, we learned in Reloaded, was a mathematician, who, in creating this vast program could balance the equations and hold the power of humanity in his hands, because those who hold the answer hold the understanding. In this film we find his equal opposition. That one whose attempts to unbalance the equations effect a chain reaction of unbalance between bi-polar opposites Neo and Smith. 	In Reloaded we were thrown a bunch of psychobabble about how Neo and Smith were one in the same. This is true in Revolutions as we find the only way to balance an equation is to make both sides of equal proportion, leading up to that final battle sequence, which may make sense of, or complicate matters even worse. 	That's what I would have liked to see more of in Revolutions. Although, it is a smarter film than critics are giving it credit for. And it doesn't surprise me. When something is given such mass appeal it is easy to become immobile to hate for no better reason than to be the one saying something different. 	 Unlike the first two films, with Revolutions it comes down to a war between parallels that are acted out instead of further exploring reasons. I was looking for more curiosity in the methods behind the action, but such is not the case. All ideas seemed second to the endless shooting inside the Bay of Zion. But to a certain advantage point I was still content that this was a good film because we are receiving no more than what was avoided but pushed toward during Reloaded; a special effects extravaganza.<br/><br/>	And an extravaganza it was. The person next to me in the theatre could only utter two words as the Sentinels swarmed into Zion, the first being `holy...' With that, there is no doubt in my mind that it will be years before the effects in this film will even be comprehensible to all the other special effects driven films to follow. 	I know that I have neglected to examine much of the story and characters of Revolutions but in all honesty it would be impossible to have someone follow anything that happens in this film without prior knowledge to the first two. I think of this as more a theoretical analysis rather than an opinionated view, because there is much more to be explained and discovered in the questions I was left with than in the actual technique of the filmmaking.<br/><br/>	 I'm reluctant to say that Revolutions is the worst film in the trilogy, simply because it was more entertainment than thought. But I still have my impressions that this series is not the culture-shock phenomenon that many claimed it to be. During the bonus features of the DVD for Reloaded I heard someone say in an interview that this could be the most complex movie ever made. I highly doubt that, but it could very well be the smartest and nicest looking action movie of its time."

And the Wachowski Brothers fall for that terrible Hollywood habit of having crowds cheering at the end of their film (a la the team winning the big game kind of moment).<br/><br/>Which leads me to ask this.  Was anyone else struck by the fact that, at the end, we're basically back to square one?

","The biggest disappointment since Alien 3. Crammed with cryptic existential references that make no sense to anyone who hasn't seen the previous 2 films this movie has zero stand alone value. The main characters have diminished roles and much of the film is eaten up by a huge battle between the good humans and the bad guy sentinels that does absolutely nothing to advance the plot. Add to this a twist at the end that appears to be a setup for a fourth episode. The characters are what made the first film, and largely the second, but Revolutions is taken over by CGI effects. I could not wait for it to end. This is some of the worst writing I have seen in a big budget film. The nice the about the Star Wars or Indiana Jones series' was that they were not based on popular novels so each one could be a fairly complete film in itself.

","Here's how I would plan to fix The Matrix Trilogy, via trimming scenes.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, I can't add footage:<br/><br/>
THE MATRIX (original):<br/><br/>-Leave it alone, mostly.<br/><br/>-Add more explanations to fill logic gaps in the concept, like ""Why would you want to leave the matrix for the creepy real world?"", or ""Why is blacking out the sun the best solution for defeating the machines?"" and ""Why don't the machines use other energy sources?"" and ""Why not use other animals for energy?  Wouldn't they be less likely to escape?"" and ""If we're fed the liquified dead, wouldn't we end up consuming faster than the rate in which people die?""<br/><br/>-Make the last shot (Neo flying up) feel less silly in comparison to the previous visuals.<br/><br/>
THE MATRIX RELOADED:<br/><br/>-Lose everything to do with Link and Zee.  This side story doesn't do anything to enhance the main plot.<br/><br/>-Cut out any unnecessary annoying moments of ""the Kid"".<br/><br/>-Leave in the ""Hmm, upgrades."" fight and the revelation that Smith is copying himself.<br/><br/>-Cut out the whole dance rave.<br/><br/>-Cut out the part where morpheus tells them all to dance.<br/><br/>-Cut most of the sex scene, but leave the last part when Neo starts losing his focus because of the dream.<br/><br/>-Leave in Smith's posession of Bane.<br/><br/>-Cut out the Oracle's talk about the Merovingian, but leave the talk about finding the Keymaker.<br/><br/>-Leave the Burly Brawl, but shorten it, so it doesn't run forever before Neo realizes he can fly.<br/><br/>-Leave the introduction of the Merovingian in, but shorten the unnecessary philosophizing, and Persephone's betrayal and her kiss, but cut out the part where she asks the other servant to tell Merovingian what she's done, and go straight to the part where she gives them the Keymaker.<br/><br/>-Here's the shocker.  Lose the twins fight, the whole Chateau fight, the Garage, the Entire Car Chase and Neo flying from the mountains to save them.  Although entertaining, this is an entire huge portion of the movie that is dedicated to just getting ahold of the Keymaker, and no character development or discoveries are made in the process.<br/><br/>-Go straight from finding the Keymaker in his cell to planning on how to get Neo into the Tower to get to the door of light.<br/><br/>-Leave everything alone during the action in the skyscraper and power station, and Trinity risking her life for Neo.<br/><br/>-Leave the Architect scene.  This is the heart of Reloaded's story.<br/><br/>-Have Neo catch Trinity before the bullet hits her and skip the whole ""Bringing her back scene"" and just have them kiss and wake up in the real world.<br/><br/>-Let Neo stop the Sentinels, but cut before he passes out, straight to the discussion about Bane's mysterious survival of the ""accident"".<br/><br/>-Cut the first half of the last shot to only reveal Bane, implying that<br/><br/>Neo is fine.<br/><br/>
THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS:<br/><br/>-Cut out the whole start of the film with neo being comatose and left at the train station.  And go straight to him being awake.  Nothing is really different about him after the coma state anyway.<br/><br/>-Lose everything to do with Club Hell, the Trainman, Sati and her family and having to rescue Neo, and themes about programs capable of love.<br/><br/>(All this has nothing to do with ending the war or helping the characters advance in relevant thought.)<br/><br/>-The tricky part here is to do some clever editing to explain the Oracle's new appearance without talking about rescuing Neo.  May even have to pretend she didn't change, which was the original intent.<br/><br/>-Sati can instead be introduced in the cookie-making scene as just another child that the Oracle looks after, in her apartment.<br/><br/>-Lose any references to Sati's parents or the train station.<br/><br/>-Lose anything to do with Zee and Link's relationship.<br/><br/>-Lose the whole sequence where Zee and the bald chick are trying to stop the drill.  It doesn't change the outcome of the central story.  It just makes the movie longer and enhances the relationship story with Link, which isn't needed anyway.<br/><br/>-Trim out pointless repetetive footage of 50% of unknown characters getting killed during the battle sequence.<br/><br/>-Shorten Trinity's death scene.<br/><br/>-Replace the last shot of the sunset with real footage.  It just looks<br/><br/>hideously fake.<br/><br/>THE END<br/><br/>P.S. *Anything I haven't mentioned was probably just fine in my opinion, or I simply forgot about it."

","Ok, first, everyone who has left a comment and has not liked the movie probably didn't understand it.  You have to remember that the basis of this movie is a computer program.  So you need to think of it as a computer program.  The source thought of smith and neo as anomolies of a program, and needed to have them deleted.  So the first couple of movies are dedicated to trying to delete neo.  Now, smith has become the bigger threat.  The source now needs to get rid of smith, and neo offers a solution.  to become the antivirus solution to the source's viral problem, smith.  And he dies doing it.  Now, people didn't like the conclusion, and i didn't either until i saw it a second time.  I noticed that when neo supposedly dies, the machines drag him off.  Then they show the light version of the scene.  And if you catch it, you notice that neo, in the light scene, is blazing, almost outshining the rest of the machines.  So what the heck does that mean? If people don't catch it they think it is the end, and they are p****ed. But if people do catch it, then you know, it is not the end.  So i don't know what the Wachowski brothers are doing, but i can't wait for what they have in store."

","Yesterday, I went to see the last third of the Matrix trilogy, only to finally know, how it would end. I already was disappointed by the second one with its loads of special effects, fighting scenes and so little of storytelling that I was looking at my wrist watch after two hours and I had to realize, that only 40 minutes had passed. It was quite the same with ""Revolutions"". Of course, the special effects are awesome again, but there was nothing we hadn't seen in the two films before. And if you are only interested in great special effects, you get a lot more of it in ""Reloaded"". Seems like every idea the directors had in mind was realized in part two, so only a few ones remained for the third one. And the story is confusing for everybody who doesn't remember all details from ""Reloaded"", so you feel like being shot on a rocket into the middle of the scenery. To me the movie feels like walking through a gallery of modern art which wants to be visually impressive but is made without any inspiration. Talking that walk is a boring experience."

While the original matrix was about the conflict between humanity and computers (Viz machines) and the sequel resolved it to a conflict between the liberated humans, that is Zion and the machines, The conflict between zion and the machines doesn't get resolved. Instead it seems to get compromised. Not that it shouldn't, but the story tellers seem to have lost sight of the original conflict.. Anyway I guess I'm just confused.

True it is not as great as the first one, as it doesn't create much of suspense. There is that expectation that there it's gonna be a war movie and there would be a lot of casualties. The FX and the cgi are stunning and surely breathtaking. I  did wish though that they should have continuously adapted the simplicity that the first movie adhered into.<br/><br/>There are a lot of confusing ideas in the Matrix Revolution, as many commentators have pointed out already. The tag line itself is very confusing. Every beginning has an end.. But which beginning are they referring to? The matrix, the program that enslaves most humans didn't actually end. Morpheus at the first movie said that in order to free humanity is to destroy the matrix. (By the way I agree that it really sucks that the character of Morpheus was reduced to a Neo fanatic and the aura of authority he possessed in the first movie was overshadowed by Niobe. It's great though that they are empowering women characters.) What Neo accomplished is to destroy Agent Smith(a virus who wanted to end both the human world and the machine world), and to negotiate peace with the machines. I guess everybody is expecting that the matrix will be destroyed or maybe humanity being destroyed or maybe both. It makes me realize now, somehow, how we or some of us are deeply fascinated with destruction and non-existence.<br/><br/>There are a lot of things to ponder about The Matrix saga.

It could've been another mediocre action-yawner, but the imagination of the Wachowski Brothers was quite stunning: the mythic-like characters with their leather coats, the well-timed subject of the over-thought plot, and - after all - the philosophical, mythical and religious roots. There's even more in it, but I have to go on to the point :)<br/><br/>I rated ""The Matrix"" 7/10.<br/><br/>""The Matrix Reloaded"" instead could've been (just) a good action-flick, but the Wachowski Brothers seemed to get lost in their own story (world?). I was still stunned by the imagination of the creators, but the episodical structure of the movie and the mumbling speeches made it unclear and hardly watchable. But still somehow watchable. One scene made me laugh, I liked the self-irony in another one, there was even a scene I could call ""real art"". Not much, but still something.<br/><br/>I rated ""The Matrix Reloaded"" 4/10<br/><br/>Now we come to the final chapter. It's a pity, that of every positive aspect I mentioned above, only one was left in ""The Matrix Revolutions"" - the Wachowski Brother's imagination. The visual part is real good (although sometimes I've had the feeling it was too overblown). But that's it. Nothing more. Many moment were pathetic, some were daub. But the worst is that the creators somehow lost contact with the viewers. There was nothing left between the screen and the audience. The movie left me cold. No chemistry, no laughter, no thrills, no thoughts. No emotions (maybe except of irritation).

Why would you expect totally coherent, cookie-cutter entertainment from films based on anime and philosiphy? Have you seen anime, as most of you claim?<br/><br/>The Matrix trilogy told a story, a story about robots vs. kung-fu. When Reloaded was met with bitter, bitter hate upon release, people hated it beacuse it was such a different film than the first. I guess people just wanted more of the same, as it the norm for most American sequels. But, fortunately for those of us with brains, the brothers decided to continue the story with no regard for the conventions of the action genre.<br/><br/>Revolutions again suprises us with a completely different experience than the first two. As it's the climax for the entire trilogy, those idiots expecting conventions such as a normal three act plot will not get it. Instead, you get a thrilling and brilliant two hours of action that even tops the previous two films.

The special effects were'nt any better than ""Reloaded"".  And lastly it was just too different from the sequel.  ""Reloaded"" portrays Neo as though he is unstoppable.  He beats up Serif, escapes Smith, flies, and destroys four sentinels.  The third makes Neo appear weak.  His eyes get burned off, he gets beat up by the Trainman, and Smith kills him.  He does one good thing which is fortunately enough to save Zion.  Trinity looks stronger than Neo until the end when he goes on and she is killed.

","When I saw Reloaded back in May I wasn't overly impressed with it, but I excused a lot of it's poorness by saying it'll be made better by the third installment. I naively thought that all the shoddy half-developed ideas in the second part would be settled in Revolutions. What kind of fool am I?<br/><br/>Revolutions has just the same problems as Reloaded. Ok there's not as much middling philosophy but there's still a lot of very awkward dialogue. I'm talking Star Wars prequel bad here. And there seems to be too much stuff going on that just doesn't fit in. The way I see it, they could have made one great Matrix sequel with all the good ideas that they had. Instead they spread these out over two films and padded them with obvious filler material.<br/><br/>I'll give you the best example of this I can without landing in heavy spoiler territory. Do you remember how Reloaded ended? The supposed cliffhanger. Where you see Bane, the guy 'possessed' by Agent Smith, lying on board the ship with Keanu and gang. Which wasn't really anything close to being a twist cliffhanger, since we'd seen him twice already in the film earlier, and he didn't seem very threatening then anyway. ('Right I'm going to kill Neo with this knife. Ah no he's turned around. I won't do it now.') Sorry I digress. I'm supposed to be writing about Revolutions. Right, so that plot-line is carried on a bit and I was stunned at how crap it's played out. Plus the unfortunate actor is forced into trying to be Hugo Weaving cool. I'll credit him for really trying. He can't manage it though.<br/><br/>But hey, at least it has good action scenes to counter-balance all this rubbish, right? Well.......... no. There's a shoot-out that's just like the lobby shootout from the first Matrix, only not as good. There's the bit that the trailers always showed, with the big robot thingys shooting the thousands of sentinels. Which from an effects viewpoint is very impressive. However this becomes numbingly repetitive and drags on far too long. Leaving just the fight between Neo and Smith as the only really good action bit. One out of three is not a very admirable score.<br/><br/>And to make matters worse they take everything WAY too seriously. You might argue that they're trying to make a serious story, but Lord of the Rings is a dark serious story and yet Peter Jackson understands that you need to have lightness now and again. It makes the darker scenes stand out more. Oh and I'm not even going to get started on all the Messiah overtones otherwise I'll be here all blinking day.<br/><br/>But hmm, after all of that, I have to add there is still *some* good stuff to see. The aforementioned Hugo Weaving. He doesn't have a large amount of screen time but that which he does have is quality. And Bruce Spence is nothing short of a shining star.<br/><br/>In the end though I'm tempted just to be content watching the original Matrix now and again, and blocking out the existence of both sequels from my mind forever."
"Matador07","5","0","0","8 November 2003"," Decent action film, But Unworthy Sequel
","Well...And I guess that's kind of where this left me.  Just well...ok.<br/><br/>
(some minor spoilers)<br/><br/>The first Matrix was great.  The second was much less so, and you could sense Hollywood creeping in around the edges in the stock characters and cheesy moments.  Now in the third installment Hollywood has taken over -- complete with the Fallacy of the Talking Villain (multiple times!) and people gasping out 5 minute long death speeches wherein they get to spit out their entire philosophy on life and ask you to kiss them -- at which point they abruptly die.  You also have thousands of casualties, a destroyed city, but of course all we care about is the swelling music as two secondary characters come together to embrace.  Sigh.  So cliched in a series which was once so original.  All that was missing was a Red Digital Readout counting down to exactly 1.0 seconds before stopping.<br/><br/>As an action flick, this movie does fine.  Its better than most, and has an excellent, although flawed 45 minute action sequence at its heart (although somebody will have to explain to me why the squids school around like fish allowing themselves to be shot rather than swarming and overwhelming the defenders -- oh yeah, because they would have swarmed and overwhelmed the defenders and that wouldn't have been good.).  And I think I really have to talk to the machines about their city defenses -- all you have to do is fly up and ""oops"", we didn't think anybody could attack from above?  Hey -- maybe this war could be won yet.  Unfortunately, the movie it lacks the guts to be truly grim, and at all times we have to be pestered by cute Hollywood moments, and characters who once were interesting and deep have now been reduced to cardboard cutouts going ""whoa!"" as special effects blow up in their face.<br/><br/>And as a thinking movie -- well it doesn't do much of that.  And that's the real disappointment.  It is so obvious at this point that the first movie was intended to be a stand alone movie, and really should have stayed that way.  Not only is there a real inability to capitalize on the mind blowing concepts of the original in this film, they are largely discarded along with most of the details and rules therein.  In fact there are a large number of flat out discontinuity errors not only between Revolutions and the the original, but between Revolutions and Reloaded as well.  And characters and events critical to the first two movies are just tossed aside here -- why, oh why, have the Architect come on at the end of the second one to give us the I am God speech and hope for the trilogy's intellectual premise, only to throw it away within the first half hour here and say ""oh he doesn't know anything""?  Why do the ships suddenly have guns when in the first we knew that ""EMP is our only defense against the machines""?  Wouldn't it perhaps have been a good idea to try to shoot the squids in the first one rather than throwing the EMP and almost blowing up Neo's mind?<br/><br/>
Anyway, the movie is fine for eye candy.  But the matrix itself is all but discarded now as totally irrelevant, and the interesting philosophical concepts and questions about the nature of reality are all gone.  Answers of a sort are given, but they are unsatisfactory at best, and just flat out dumb at worst.  Action has triumphed over brains, and one more time you get the feeling that Hollywood has entirely missed what made the first movie so interesting and respected even among those who don't normally go in for sci-fi or action flicks.  The extravagent explosions in this one just can't cover up its essential emptiness.  Bottomline = disappointing."

","I don't understand why most people think this movie is a wreck. I believe that this deserves more recognition than criticism. The movie is great, better than Reloaded but inferior to the original Matrix. I liked this movie but alas, my opinion does not reflect the opinion of all.<br/><br/>""God Damn it Morpheus. Not everyone believes what you believe!""<br/><br/>Recognize this line? In Reloaded, Lock was right in saying this but what mattered was that Morpheus' hope and faith prevailed. I have the same feeling and maybe, all the other people out there that understand me. Some people simply do not understand the story, some have a different view what has to happen.<br/><br/>No one can really judge Revolution beyond what it is. Some people say that it left us with more questions than answers. Maybe that is right but I think that is justifiable. The Wachowski Brothers chose to end the trilogy this way because this ending is what they thought as the most appropriate. The Matrix as a `concept-put-into-a-movie' is a massive undertaking. What they did with the movies is to convey the philosophies and ideas they had in mind. They shared it with us with the movies. They deserve the right to manipulate every aspect of the movie. Maybe, many people say that the ending is miserable because they want the trilogy to have a different ending. Maybe, consciously or sub-consciously, we have different ideas on what will be the fate of the matrix and Neo. As for me, I simply wanted to know what will happen without STRONGLY putting anything in my mind to block what ideas, thoughts or concepts that Revolutions would convey to me.<br/><br/>As for the lack of Philosophy, I believe that even though it lacked what the original Matrix and Reloaded offered us for philosophy, it still challenged us. Remember the ending? Maybe the Wachowskis CHOSE that ending because they left the rest of the story for the audience. They gave us the chance to believe in what we want to believe. Some say that another sequel is possible, but if the Wachowskis are true to their word, then possibly my theory is right.<br/><br/>The Wachowskis are not your typical writer-director that we have. They are exceptional. They do not do the things that our typical writer-director would do. All of these might be a part of their ingenuity and creativity. Remember, since the beginning, they have already laid out everything for the Matrix trilogy and that only money and time prevented them from presenting the story all-out. The pace of the third film in terms of events and storyline was also justifiable because the ending was already predetermined. The ending was simple and yet, provocative.<br/><br/>They may sound as a biased review but I also acknowledge some of the shortcomings of the directors. I found clichés, errors, faults etc. etc. and yes, some of my questions were left unanswered. But some questions are best left unanswered.<br/><br/>Well, as the story once implied, it all begins with choice. Whether we choose to accept the conclusion or go with our own opinion is up to us. But this is all I have to say, if you truly appreciated the Matrix and know how to understand it, then you would first weigh all the factors and see and comprehend beyond what you know and believe. The maybe, all of us would realize the simple Truth behind all of this. And in this case, the problem is Choice."

I personally think that with GOOD editing and one major flaw taken out, this very bad movie could have been at least a passible addition to my DVD collection.<br/><br/>Cut out half of the ""train man"" scenes. Cut to the father program taking girl on train, Neo being denied and running after train. A lot of dialog and new concepts being introduced (ie: computer programs love one another) that aren't backed up with a touch point later in the movie (a common flaw in this movie) I'd probably even cut out the dance club scene because it serves no purpose except for Persephone's chest.<br/><br/>Cut out the whole possessed crewman scenes. Although his imitation of Agen t Smith was intriguing, again, the script/plot did not expand on this concept. So were the agents going to start on humans when they finished with the machines? No reason or purpose. But of course, how would we mutilate Neo? That is the biggest flaw in the movie and should have never been included. The Wachowski's read Dune...that's for sure.<br/><br/>What I call the ""God bless us everyone"" scene where the 16 year old announces to Zion that Neo did it and the war is won. Cut that whole damn thing out. Morpheus watches the sentinels swim away and says ""Neo"" And has anything in any of the movies led us to believe that Morpheus would go to Zion instead of with Neo? Less is more, especially in movies.<br/><br/>Cut the ""I can see the true nature of the universe but not the rebar sticking out of you"" scene. I was literally making yak yak motions with my hands during a climatic scene. Matrix is stylized...not corny. Big difference.<br/><br/>Literally 20 mins of the dock scene could have been cut out. Yeah, we get it. You are fighting overwhelming odds ala: Stormtroopers. ""It's a good day to die"" has been there and done that.<br/><br/>Stick with the story. Stick with the characters we know and not expect us to feel for strangers. Tie up loose ends, if you bring up a variable, answer it later. These are all basic scriptwriting principles that needed to followed, especially when you are taking 3 movies to do it.<br/><br/>The Wachowski brothers have such talent & vision...what happened?

","I have never been a HUGE fan of this series. I was not blown away by the original Matrix like most. Bullet time wasn't all that impressive, and I've never been a fan of Hong Kong style action movies. Plus it starred Keanu Reeves. How good could it actually be? But I still enjoyed it in an MTV-influenced kind of way. Now being the movie fan I am, I went to see Reloaded when it came out. When it was over I wanted my money back. Never in my life have I experienced such a overblown, self-important, mumbo jumbo spewing piece of dreck in my life. It does rate as one of the worst movies I've seen in recent years. Sorry fanboy geeks, cool fx do not a movie make. In fact some of the fx were pretty bad. What's funny is the big chase scene they claimed was going to revolutionize movies, was topped twice this year. (T3 and Bad Boys 2. But then NO chase scenes will ever top final chase in The Road Warrior) But again, being a movie fan, I had to find out how it all ends. I went in with zero expectations, and ended up having a lot of fun. Well, after the first half hour anyway. The battle of Zion is one of the great action specatcles of the last 10 years. It is so 'in-your-face' that you feel like you're in the middle of it. It is worth the price of admission alone for the chance of seeing that on the big screen. The chase through the mechanical tunnels with the hovercraft and sentinels is dizzyingly exciting. The ships can twist any which way, and they took my stomach with them. Fun times. And while it utilized too much of it's trademark slo-mo, the final fight between Neo and Smith is the epic brawl the series needed. I mean these are two gods in this world. The fight couldn't be confined to groundlocked round kicks. They fly around, duking it out all over the city (ala Superman 2). Nice visuals with the lightning. Plus the story moved a lot faster versus Reloaded. Sur the first half hour or so dragged while they mopped up the afterbirth of Reloaded. But once it got moving, it was ""Get out of the way! Coming through! Lady with a baby!"" fast. It may not wrap everything up at the end, but how could it? It's too lucrative of a franchise. If the current group involved in making this series decides to not make anymore, at least the studio still has a viable franchise to squeeze a few more dollars out of, and hire new blood to take over.

","This installment of the Matrix provides those who were fans of the entire original movie with a full fledged sequel worthy of the franchise.<br/><br/>Not to say that Reloaded was entirely bad, but for the sake of the plot it could have been greatly condensed and worked into making this installment a bit longer.<br/><br/>A brief spoiler alert - revealing concepts, not details.<br/><br/>Like it's early predecessors, Matrix Revolutions embarks into a world which successfully synthesizes classical mythology, theology and philosophy into a tightly orchestrated system of checks and balances. Like the first movie - and unlike the second - every scene and detail counts in understanding the ultimate stakes and mesmerizing and thought provoking conclusion.<br/><br/>Where Buddhism and Near Eastern prophecy and philosophy are fused in the first movie, hinduism, greek mythology, gnosticism and kenotic theology come together in a seamless flow of thoughts and questions for the first portion of the film.<br/><br/>Characters feel the way they did in the first movie, not disjointed and out of place - Neo is inquisitive and enabling new powers of mind and body, Trinity is demure and in control, the Oracle is given some fantastic conversations, and Morpheus' faith is rebuilt - the dialogues can be read romantically - as many reviewers do - or as sappy, though it is clear that if you can recognize the paradigm being referred to, there is more to the love that is at stake.<br/><br/>The issue is one of balance - in a stalemate of chaos, sometimes the one who instigates instability does so as an act of heroism - in order to open the door of opportunity for a better world. Ultimately what Neo is capable of undoing in limbo he must equally face in the real world, and there he meets his greatest challenges and must overcome his greatest fears...<br/><br/>Unlike the second movie, Neo can't afford to be smug - as if he ever had a reason to be.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are fantastic - really pushing the limits of technology and totally immersive - and as a tech spoiler, it has the feel of a hard-edge war movie - no lasers, and not too much lightning, the battles are full of hot lead - like riding in a WWII cockpit to the tenth degree - seeing the white-hot blaze and hearing the guns in stereo is an incredible experience - they make ""Return of the Jedi"" tie interceptor scenes look like a parking lot. But it's not all guns and glory - plenty of hand to hand fighting which borders on metaphysical in force and scope.<br/><br/>If you loved the first movie, dialog and fighting, this will not disappoint. If you disliked the second movie, this certainly redeems the franchise. If you loved both, well you know what to expect. See it in IMAX if you can."

","I would like to say that this movie was just great.  I'm not going to say anything about anyone's critiques of the movie because they didn't like it. I just thought the action was superb and the storyline was just wonderful. Revolutions is the kind of movie that either you love or you hate.  And I think it was difficult to come up with an ending that satisfy people, because if Zion was saved people would say it was too easy and if Zion was destroyed people wouldn't like the whole bad ending kind of thing.  But I think with Revolutions, the ending had a half and half kind of thing where you have tragic things happening and good things as well.  And I don't say that I think this movie is great simply for the action, I think this is one of the greatest action/sci-fi movies that develops such as great plot and pulls the audience in.  I think Revolutions was what I expected and although it may never live up to the first movie, it still should be recognized as a great film.  And keep in mind that, the first matrix movie set the bar really high and it was something not many had seen before in action/sci-fi movies.  So its tough and maybe even impossible for the other two movies to ever top the original."

","¡°Everything has a beginning has an end.¡± But obviously a lot people hated the ending. I¡¯ve seen ¡°The Revolution¡± today and here is my two cents: guys, just because you hated the ending doesn¡¯t mean it¡¯s a bad ending.<br/><br/>(spoilers)<br/><br/>In fact I think this ending makes perfect sense. Maybe people expected some big war and human being will be set free and the Matrix will be destroyed¡ªjust like the usual Hollywood endings, human being always wins. But why must Zion win? How can it win? The machines are far more powerful. It will be ridiculous if they won even the One has superpower. So they have to negotiate and make peace with the machines. It also answered the question I¡¯ve asked myself since the first Matrix: How are they going to do with so many people once they are set free? Can they survive without the machines? Now I don¡¯t have to worry about them.<br/><br/>It looks like a happy lame ending in fact it is not. It is tragic. Someone sacrificed himself/herself and the others were saved. Plus the peace is not forever. In human history, at the beginning of wars people has all kinds of reasons to fight but at the end they just want peace and no one remember why they have to go to the war in the first place. How true!<br/><br/>(end of spoilers)<br/><br/>So The Matrix ends in a self-complete way. Revolution doesn¡¯t always destroy everything and nothing wrong with that. Of course there are questions unanswered but even the first Matrix leave many questions unanswered, it¡¯s typical Matrixy. You need to figure out by yourself. And I will be very happy if they make more animatrix, comics and games.<br/><br/>As for the special effect and battle scenes, they are entertaining. The pacing is better than Roloaded. When I was watching the movie all the audience in my theatre hold their breath till the end. And all my friends like it. I don¡¯t understanding why people hate it so much. If only they would think again, they will find The Revolution is a good movie. Time will tell.<br/><br/>I admit when I read the early bad reviews a few days ago, my faith to the Matrix shaken. Now I really feel shame about those moments, because I allowed myself to be effected by other¡¯s reviews. The only way to understand Matrix is to see it for yourself."

","I just got out of the Matrix Revolutions a couple of hours ago and I think I am beginning to dislike the film more by the minute.  There are a lot of problems with this film, but to me the primary trouble with it is simple there isn't any closure, they didn't answer any of the questions they asked, and the action sequences were underwhelming.  First off let's start with the action sequences, simply put they blew their creative wad on the first two films.  The Zion shootout was allright but felt too artificial, nothing like the rescue scene from the first one and the brilliant highway chase scene from the second one, and the final battle between Neo and Smith was allright but hey we have scene Neo take on a hundred agent Smiths in Reloaded how much fun is it going to be to see him just fight one.  The movie doesn't answer any of it's questions either, it is like someone asking you a question and then skimping on the answer.  They left so much for us to ponder with the first two and they basically copped out on the answers.  I suspect this film was heavily edited and we may see a three hour DVD one of these days.  Anyways the film is a mess and I am sooooooooo disapointed. I loved the first one and thought Reloaded was even better, this one was just a letdown."

"ijahamran","Null","0","0","7 November 2003"," Was it a movie or a page from a comic book?
","***contains spoilers***<br/><br/>It is strange to think that a few years ago, because of the huge buzz surrounding it, I resisted watching The Matrix until it was old news. And I am glad I waited, because once I did get around to watching it, I felt so incredibly overwhelmed. The Matrix was a really REALLY good science fiction movie.<br/><br/>But what of its sequels? I watched Reloaded a day after it was released in my local cinemas. Sadly, even sitting in the prime location of a THX Hall didn't lessen my disappointment. I thought Reloaded was a very wordy movie, corny at best and unfathomable most of the time. There were so many questions. How can Neo exist if the Architect has destroyed the first 4 versions of the Matrix? And if dying in the Matrix means dying in the 'real' world, how come everyone else is still alive? How did the Oracle, Merovingian and the Architect know what choices Neo will make? How come all the tvs in the room where Neo met the Architect were tuned to his 'future' reactions?<br/><br/>So many questions, so many action sequences and I left the theater feeling dissatisfied.<br/><br/>And then, just like a corny line in a movie, everything CLICKED. It's like playing an RPG where there are multiple alternate endings. Suddenly Reloaded became a brilliant movie - it lulls you into thinking that everything is clear cut: that there is the matrix (green) and there is the real world (blue). But the questions it posed yield no answer based on this simplistic assumption. Unless. Unless the green world is merely a simulation of the matrix, and the blue world -- the one that we perceive as the real world -- is in fact the real matrix itself. And that in 'reality', everyone is still hooked to machines in some way or another, tubes and all.<br/><br/>Which was why Revolutions also made perfect sense. Once I opened up my mind to the possibility of 3 worlds, it explained why Neo was able to  stop the machines in blue world (as if it were 'the matrix') and why he could 'see' the energy patterns even when he was supposedly blind. Why Agent Smith paused and 'recalled' his script as he stood in front of Neo. Yup, they've been there. They've done that. What was different is that in the 5th version of the 'matrix'(green world), Neo made a different choice ie to save Trinity instead of saving Zion. Hence, he met an alternate ending. But just like all RPGs, the ending may be different but the outcome is the same: the world is saved once again and everything went back to what it was supposed to be.<br/><br/>Revolutions can be summed up with these 4 points: Machines attacks Zion. Neo destroys Agen Smith. Matrix 5 reaches gestation and ends. Reboot (enter Matrix 6 where everything is well again). Will Sati see Neo again? Of course she will!<br/><br/>So, Revolutions held no surprises. A lot of corny lines esp in the scene where Trinity was dying. I almost shouted .. come on, die already! And the kungfu scenes, especially where Neo & Agent Smith pitted skills, were comical.<br/><br/>Perhaps the Wachowski brothers are trying to tell us not to take the Matrix too seriously? I give Revolutions 6.4 out of 10. The production is better than your average movie (hence the higher than average rating), but just like any fast food meal ... half an hour later you'd feel hungry again. Watch only if you are a die-hard fan. I'm ready to have ppl tp my house now."

Apologies to the Wizard of Ozs and Citizen Kanes of the world, but I am struck by the sheer weight of imagination and detail of the whole movie series. While literature has explored the ideas in the Matrix before in one state or another, have we ever seen such mindboggling, contemporary creativity outside of the French new wave in the 60s? Their structure was different, the ideas were new and they explored territories American movies didn't...how out of place the Matrix seems to me..in a world where everything entertainment has to be explained leaving the audience to fill in no gaps with their own logic and we're left with a hollow, empty feeling days after seeing the movies. You may hate the Matrix, disagree with its storytelling, but you just won't forget it..its not possible, and unlike much of the vaunted and current LOTR trilogy, its is totally relevent to modern living and thought processes. I will only grow in my understanding of the whole series, I'll only learn to appreciate it more and in hindsight. Its the sign of a true classic, and the series has instantly become that.<br/><br/>

","If the first matrix had a perfect 10 out of 10, both reloaded and revolutions have a 9. Revolutions didn't have the super cool freeway car chase or the extraordinary bullet stopping from Reloaded. That's because most of the story happens in the `real world' and not inside the matrix.But it had some really beautifully made scenes like the battle for Zion and most of all the end fight between good and evil ( of the same actually character) for total power over the matrix. The script was really good (with the exception of some cliché lines) and it ends all answers without many explanations (that's a good thin in a movie). Revolution is I think the best way to end the circle. The path of the One Ends and the war is indeed over. The Philosophy still exists and new theories are present. (Do not expect anything too deep - but it's cool!).The music is a bless Don Davis best work ever. ! My best scene is when Smith (witch found a way to pass into the real world) fights with Neo inside the `logos'. My worst one, is when Monica Belucci actually speaks, she really sucks.

","I am a huge fan of the first Matrix.  It was groundbreaking with its special effects, kung fu fight sequences, slow motion ""bullet time"", and of course unbelievable storyline.  I've watched the Matrix DVD close to 20 times.  I saw Reloaded the first night it came out and though I was a little confused by it at first, I found it to be a highly entertaining and acceptable sequel to such a spectacular first film.  I went and saw it again the second night of its release and enjoyed it even more - there was quite a bit of dialogue/plot twist that I was able to follow better upon repeat viewing.<br/><br/>In Reloaded, there were many memorable new characters added, more groundbreaking fight scenes, and discussions on fate, choice, inevitability, man's dependence on machines, and such.  The storyline was tricky but enthralling and some of my favorite scenes included the development of Agent Smith's even more entertaining and hilarious character.  ""Me TOO!"".<br/><br/>
What I expected of Revolutions from the trailer and past experience with these films was nothing less than spectacular.  I couldn't have been more excited for November to come around.  When I saw most of the critics reviews of ""C's"", I recalled most didn't like the first Matrix initially anyway so I kept my hopes up.  What I felt when I left the theater of Revolutions was utter disappointment and even a loss for words.<br/><br/>To me, Revolutions was a movie failure of dire proportions.  Every aspect that made the previous movies so entertaining was lost.  Unlike the Matrix and Reloaded I could pretty much predict most of what would happen.  That does not make for an entertaining movie - as a side note, trailer creators need to save a few secrets and simply tantalize, not give away an entire plot (learn something from Lord of the Rings, NOT the Italian Job).<br/><br/>So many plot lines in Reloaded were either forgotten or discarded.  Why mention multiple versions of the destruction of Zion if you have no plans to include it in the conclusion?  What purpose did the kiss between Persephone and Neo serve in the Reloaded?  Why is this version different from the other previous versions?  etc.<br/><br/>Where also was the kungfu fighting that made the first two movies so memorable?  Sure, there was the scene with another corridor and pillars and guns, but this time everyone shoots upside down.  Wow.  How impressive, how groundbreaking.  (SARCASM)  And what purpose did the story line about the Trainman or the ""family"" of programs serve?  None readily apparent.  Even the time spent on the Merovingian -an enthralling character in Reloaded, now extremely pacifistic - was likely added into Revolutions as a time filler and a useless plot turn.<br/><br/>Which brings me to character development.  Every good movie has it - think why Empire Strikes Back is the best of all 5 Star Wars movies - Revolutions had little or none.  Morpheus has no real presence or growth.  Agent Smith becomes bland at best and just a typical ""bad guy"" wanting power, nowhere near his curiously devious self of Matrix and Reloaded.  Link was an interesting new character in Reloaded, but again wasted screen time.  And the kid who helped save the docks from the first attack - how predictable and wasted a character is he?  Three cheers for the little guy who wants to be all grown up.  Brings a tear to my eye.  Whatever.<br/><br/>The movie just started slow and ended slower.  There was no real excitement in its introduction (learn something from the first 10 minutes of LOTR Two Towers PLEASE on how to tie sequels together) and the plot didn't pick up much in pace until nearly 45 minutes in.  I'm not implying there wasn't any action, but even during such ""intense"" scenes I found myself losing interest and I felt bad for myself and everyone else around me.  The scenes of dialogue between Neo and Trinity as well as all those of the crew on the two hovercrafts at the beginning were mind-numbingly boring.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not all about action, but dialogue should serve its purpose to learn more about the characters and plot, not simply lengthen a movie to 2 hours.<br/><br/>I couldn't believe I'd even find the flashy special effects fight scenes between Neo and Smith less than exciting either, but they were.  How many ways can you one-up yourself in the same sort of good vs evil kung fu fight. Wow, they keep hitting each other but this time even harder... ooo, slow motion fist to face impact... and wow, large shock wave impact explosion. It didn't keep me do anything for me - nothing near the helicopter scene in Matrix.  (By the way, a great scene to test the low end abilities of your audio surround system)<br/><br/>I did not think the end at all probable or acceptable.  It wasn't really the end that had been alluded to by the original Matrix and Reloaded.  Simply stating 'Oh, bye the way, any human who wants to leave the Matrix is free to do so'.  In reality, no man wants to live in bondage especially in a reality that is controlled by someone/thing else, so in fact every man would choose to leave the Matrix and the machines would then no longer have their ""Copper Tops"" and would cease to exist without a power supply.  That could not happen, so they would not be able to ""live together"" peacefully - there will always be war.<br/><br/>Personally, I would have rather waited a year for a final movie that captured the questions and characters of the first 2 films than  a short 6 months for such a thrown-together film that wasted those same characters and tried to over impress its audience with special effects in order to cover a plot that was severely lacking in forethought or grandeur.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure I won't watch this movie again or at least not for some time - which is tragic because The Matrix and Reloaded were leading up to something better than they what we in turn paid to accept as an ending.<br/><br/>But above all, make your own decision on the film. Thanks for reading!<br/><br/>
As an after thought, I agree with many others that it is tragic about the loss of the Gloria Foster who played the Oracle in movies 1 & 2, but to be honest, she could not alone have made this final Matrix better.  She was missed, though."

However, the story inspires so many questions and possible interpretations of the answers presented that it ends up being too big for its britches. Trying to sate people's thirst for the Matrix universe in three films is like trying to explore the Star Trek universe without a library of novels and technical manuals. It can only come up short.

","******SPOILERS AHEAD**************<br/><br/>
First and formost i must say that i really enjoyed this movie, but im noticing a lot of posters say that questions were left unanswered.  But in fact most or all of the questions were answered.  Smith was created by the architect to balance the equation, we know this because the oracle says that the architect always balances equations and that Smith is Neo's opposite, so when Smith kills Neo, he kills himself.  Go back to algebra here for a second, in an equation when you take away one part you gotta do the opposite, Neo dies, so Smith dies, get it? Neo knew that was what he had to do, and he dies for the people of Zion.  Also the big ending scene gives out a LOT more info if you pay attention, all the people of the Matrix are going to be let out, the Oracle asks the architect, ""what about all the lost souls?"" (the people in the matrix) and he says that they will be freed (in a lot more words)you can also tell this because if you notice there is NOBODY in the matrix in this last scene.  The other question everyone is saying is unanswered is how Neo can use his powers outside the matrix, once again the Oracle TELLS you POINT BLANK, ""The one's powers extend beyond the matrix and into all worlds"" or something like that.  And whoever is saying there is too much CGI is completley wrong.  I'd say theres more talking in this one than in the second one.  Also the last fight scene is nothing short of amazing, plenty of kung-fu fighting and then over the top battles we've all come to know and love about the matrix.  and the last fight for Zion simply gorgeous, those mechs were so badass.

","There are many disappointed people, I can see their disappointment but at the same time I don't think they should be, the writers knew how they wanted this film to end and the end was fitting to the story. The style of the film wasn't continuous with the bullet time and the kung fu of the first 2. But I don't necessarily disprove of this course because the 3rd film is very different from the first 2, there is more at stake outside of the matrix and so of course you are never going to be able to have the same action (not necessarily worse) in the real world.<br/><br/>The end wasn't spectacular, story wise, and I am sure that it didn't end how many would have expected. Many say it could not have ended any other way but of course that is not true. I don't dislike the ending because when I look back on the whole story I take from this film that we live by the consequences of our choices. It is this theme which I find explains the ending nicely. I don't want to spoil it for anyone but hopefully those who have seen the film know what I mean.<br/><br/>Overall, the whole story I find extremely creative and I whole-heartedly thank the writers for such a captivating idea. My personal feeling is I don't feel happy at the end, I feel how I should, but I know I have experienced one of the greatest stories of all time and for that I feel pleased that I have seen it and understood it. It's funny how we go through life and enjoy a good story in our spare time, and how emotionally we become attached to them; I will never believe, even those who say they disliked this, that they would have preferred to have wasted their time doing something else, it was ingenious. I liked this story and I liked this conclusion it was extremely entertaining throughout and instead of saying ""could this really have ended any other way"" I say, ""they picked the right ending"".<br/><br/>-Ritch"

","Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions are living from special effects, special effects and special effects. The first movie had a really amazing plot plus never seen computer generated effects.

There are so many fan-stories for possible plotsequels which are much more interesting and thrilling that what I saw in cinema.<br/><br/>Well Hollywood split your moviebudget and make more good movies with a nice plot than spend millions of dollars for a big action and animation demonstration.<br/><br/>less is often more..."

I left feeling empty, especially knowing that there are no more installments on their way (or are there....yup that's Hollywood). Truthfully though, I liked that the tone returned to that of the original, and Neo vs. Agent Smith did not disappoint. However, in the words of Brian Cox in ""Adaptation"": ""wow them in the end.""

","The Matrix Revolutions is a movie that cannot stand on its own. It's like The Matrix Revo is the second half of Matrix Reloaded. There's no beginning. Just go straight to what's Reloaded left of. That's why Revolutions try to answer all questions which seems like too much within one movie since there are a lot of questions from The Matrix and Reloaded. Less cool fighting scene doesn't help neither. And when it appears, it's the same old fighting scene we've seen from the previous two. And then Revo focused on Sentinel Attacks Zion. That looks like another movie for me. Movie about human against machine where human is outnumbered. Anyway, That's the end of Matrix Trilogy. Only the first one is the real revolution. The second one came close....But the third one is quite a let down. The thing is Revo will make some money since everyone who loves The Matrix wants to know the end of this trilogy, even if it's a big let down. The more interesting thing is what's next for Wachowski Brothers. I'm waiting for them to surprise us again."

","What a piece of crap that was! I mean, Reloaded sucked but I thought for sure Revolutions would fill in the gaps. I think the Wachowski brothers just wanted to make a few more million, they certainly weren't in it to finish the story. Revolutions had some really cool fight scenes, but the story just wasn't there. I won't say anything that might ""spoil"" it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. It's always hard to live up to a movie that pretty much benchmarked the genre it is in, which the first Matrix definately did, but look at the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, ""Star Wars"" trilogy or the ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy. They were all very strong thoughout, but the Matrix trilogy started out very strong and fizzled out very quickly. It had an intriguing storyline that made you think, and had badass action to boot. I'd say all three movies had great action, and despite that the rest of the film industry played out the cinematography that was pioneered in the first film, it's still amazing for the other two movies. But, the story really went downhill. At least Reloaded had you wondering where the plot was going to go and strongly hinted at something big to come in Revolutions, despite that in and of itself, the storyline of the movie wasn't as strong as in the first, but in Revolutions it just fell flat on it's face. The ending was VERY anticlimactic to say the least. I mean, there was no emotional build up at all. Questions still remained unanswered from Reloaded, and what the hell happened to the Oracle? I don't remember much about Reloaded, but if she was in it, I don't recall that she was a different actress from the Oracle that was in the first one. I mean, if you can't get the same actress for whatever reason, then you do something to reflect that change, she's a pivotal character, you can't just stick someone in her place and expect people not to go, ""WTF?"". Additionally, it's almost like, if you didn't see the Animatrix that was released, you're not going to understand Revolutions, and I didn't see it. I thought for sure that it would have turned out that what they thought was real life, also turned out to be part of the matrix, hence why neo was able to stop the sentinels at the end of Reloaded. Or at least something similarly intriguing. Anyway, I'm thoroughly disappointed. There was so much potential for the story and it simply was never realized. What's sad is that there are people who were so into the first movie that they probably view Reloaded and Revolutions with rose colored glasses. I was one of the biggest matrix fans you'd meet, but I'm not going to whitewash the rest of the trilogy to make it something it's not. It's a BIG let down, plain and simple. I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who feels this way, and having 24 hours of philosophy courses under my belt, I don't think anything went over my head, there was no subtance, nothing to be missed."

","To be completely honest, this movie was horrible.<br/><br/>I've read some reviews here on it; some saying it was an Amazing film with good acting, awesome fighting and a stellar ending.<br/><br/>This film lacked all three.<br/><br/>First off: Keanu still gives his dead-pan, method-actor approach he has given to the first two. The Oracle wasn't a good replacement, I didn't feel her at all. Sure, Agent Smith was good- but that's Hugo Weaving for you. The rest of the cast and crew were all right, but i just didn't feel that urgency. That's the directors' faults.<br/><br/>Secondly: There wasn't enough fighting, and when there was- it was completely trite from the first two films and almost tiring in the end fight. I won't go anymore into it, but i was even dissapointed with all of the action other than the actual battle.<br/><br/>Thirdly: The ending was sh*te. Loopholes still exist in the plot, answers never answered (which is what a third film of a trilogy is for!)and I was left extrememly disappointed- because the last 15 minutes of the film were all Studio BS.<br/><br/>Well, this MOVIE gets 1/10 in my book.

","Possible spoilers!!!<br/><br/>Be4 I start my review, I just want to say, I really do not understand why so many of you guys have slated this film. Don't you yet realise what the movie was about?? (Be4 u ask, it was about giving people back the choice they were denied; i.e. whether to stay in the Matrix or not, u remember, a world without rules.....)<br/><br/>This film is a fitting end to a masterpiece of a movie. Had it ended any other way, it would have been the easy way out. But to my utter surprise, the WA bros bit the bullet whole. (To understand what I mean, go see the movie.... more than once!!!!)<br/><br/>Our story continues pretty much from where it left off. With Neo still in his coma, Agent Smith in a human body and all hell about to break loose in Zion.<br/><br/>Unlike the first 2 Matrix films, the majority off this one takes place in the real world. This is because we have 3 missions taking place here at the same time; i.e. the 2 hover crafts going their separate ways and Zion making its last stand.<br/><br/>During this period, we see just why Nioby is such a cool pilot, (boy has she got some moves or what?!!). Neo is continuing to discover that he has more abilities than he thought, and somewhere in this journey his main aim changes, and is no longer to destroy the machines but to find a way for both humans and machines to live in peace. For those of you who took the time to understand part 2 will note the Oracle stating this numerous times. This revelation leads us to the only possible conclusion......, a titanic battle between Neo and Smith - his alter ego if you will. It was like watching two gods fight it out 'dragon ball z' style, and by that I mean fighting in the air, busting through streets, the whole shebang!!<br/><br/>And finally, we have Zion and one of the biggest and funkiest mech battles I've ever seen. I can see that no expense was spared in getting these effects on screen. They are all absolutely top notch!!<br/><br/>I really can't praise this film highly enough. It is brilliant on sooooo many levels, but you really have to listen and concentrate to get it. The love story btw Neo and Trin is still there and very much intact.<br/><br/>
The action / kung fu / mass destruction scenes are still there in spades!!<br/><br/>
And ofcourse, the mega-long, endless speeches are still there, (one not about this: I've seen quite a few reviews with people moaning about this, well to them I say, why on earth did you bother watching the first Matrix then, cause the same speeches were there and we didn't hear you complaining then huh. At the end of the day Neo chose the red pill, and we all chose the red pill with him cause we wanted to see how far the rabbit hole went, right?!? So, it's no point complaining about it now... ;-)<br/><br/>My only regrets were not seeing too much of Seraf, or Persifani-whatever getting her tale whooped by Trinity. But hey, I can live with that!!!<br/><br/>GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"

","I wasn't too dissapointed with this movie because I went in expecting it to be as good as it was.  I knew this movie wouldn't be what I wanted it to be. There are so many problems with this movie.  Some of the scenes were painful to watch because they were ridiculous.  I can't think of anything to say.  I suppose the best summary of this movie would be that it's a complete mess.  This movie could have been much better than it was, I don't know why they decided ....ughh... I can't even talk... this movie was so horrible... how did they go from The Matrix to this garbage.  I was dissapointed with Matrix Reloaded, but compared to this it was great.  I think everything went horribly wrong about 3/4 into the second movie and all the way to the end of this one. The fight scenes weren't good in this one either.  The action was too insane and too prolonged and too repetitive.  I can't remember how many times I saw people being punched into concrete walls.  The action in this movie is like watching DragonBall Z, people fly and punch each other in mid-air and throw each other into the ground causing huge bomb like explosions.  I don't know if there was a climax in this movie I think half of it is non-stop action. There is only so much action an audience can enjoy.  At one point the audience started clapping when the machines invading the docks were taken out by an EMP blast, but the audience wasn't expecting that a minute later the action would try to build up again.  They just kept on trying and trying and trying to build up to one exciting moment that never happened. I am reminded of Armageddon where in that movie they kept on throwing more and more problems on top of others that have been solved.  I don't recommend this movie and I am annoyed that the filmmakers and actors involved are going to get a load of money from us.  Even if a lot of people hate this movie they're still going to buy the third DVD just to have the complete trilogy."

","All throughout the movie I felt like the Oracle, except I didn't understand the Wachowski's choices but could still see past them. The movie was pretty much predictable (odd, since the first two didn't seem that way). My complaint is that instead of focusing on plot, story, and dialouge, we're rushed through everything by only seeing the fights and battles (and lots of guys yelling ""AAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!""). I think what attracted people to The Matrix was the same thing that attracted them to Alien. The fact that the audience hardly ever saw the machines was what added to the experience. Seeing a screen full of machines gets boring quickly, and suddenly you think ""Why did the series digress to this?"" The first film was about plot and character development. The second and third felt like a sprinter racing to the finish, knowing full well he would win long before it happened. It just became boring. Not to mention the lack of suprises that kept us on our toes like the first two movies. The concept of The Matrix series is great... it's just too bad the filmmakers chose to concentrate on special effects and large battles instead of the plot and characters emphasis present in the first film."

","Warning: Spoilers in this comment!!!<br/><br/>I am surprised at how very few people have realised the underlying connection between the Oracle, the Architect, Neo and the other non-human programs existing in the Matrix.<br/><br/>The role of Agent Smith vs. Neo is clear -- he is his opposite.<br/><br/>Neo's role however may have been misunderstood by many - he is a *controlling element* of the Matrix itself: If you were a machine and wanted to improve the experience of the Matrix to other people, how would be the best way to go about it? Recruit a human to help you out! i.e. Neo!<br/><br/>The Oracle simply tries to push events the way the Matrix's machine creators want them - by giving ambiguous hints that increase the chances of people making the decisions the machine wants.<br/><br/>At the end, when Agent Smith is destroyed - it is the machine who makes the winning/losing decision - based on Neo's show of persistence. He shows that as long as humans are alive, they will persist until the very end. So, Agent Smith is kept in check by Neo - but the machine destroys him at the end. It is a signal that it accepts the peace offer.<br/><br/>The other non-human programs also have abilities to change the Matrix to improve it as they see fit. The little girl's comments try to give this away: she says she did the sunrise and nice sky for Neo - because she knows that Neo is now part of the Matrix itself! And so are the six previous Neo persons who became part of the Matrix before him.<br/><br/>The Architect tries to explain this in Revelations, but again, most people missed out on this. Maybe the dialogue was not clear or direct enough to most people, but there is a very sound logic behind the plot.<br/><br/>The Matrix trilogy as it is till now has ended with a nice ending: an equilibrium between the machines and free living humans. Whoever wants to be released from the Matrix, can do so freely. I guess people would come and go to/from it voluntarily since there is the liberty to do so."

A good story diverts the audience's attention from the technicalities that make the film (photography, editting, soundtrack...). An OK story can still show you a good time, while revealing some of the backstage stuff. The Matrix trilogy is all about making you pay attention to the background. When I saw the 1st movie I was completely blown away. I mean, weren't we all? Then came Reloaded and Revolutions and showed me that the Wachowski brothers did not, actually, have some hidden philosophical meaning to share with the world... they scraped the story of this trilogy too thin, over too much bread. eventually, the holes in the story are too obvious, which leaves the filmmaking too obvious as well. Now that the story is out of the way... Disconnected from meanings, the movie is a spactacular piece of art. It is beautifully made, shot, editted, etc. And for this alone, this movie deserves a vote of 8/10, at least from me.

Sure the effects were great and the Wachowskis are extremely deft and precise with the cinematography but lost is the aura, mystery and the emotional intensity.<br/><br/>I can't believe i'm saying this but i was actually bored watching it. Less is more guys and somebody gave the Wachowskis a little too much money and they went completely overboard. We were lost in a slew of peripheral characters. Both Neo and Trinity, who I believe are the fulcrum of the trilogy are left on the wayside. With little time to conclude their story, i felt detached.<br/><br/>No specific scenes were memorable, the Zion fight was way too long and Trinity's death was treated with such irrelevance. There was no lingering lament, just a heartwrenched sob from Neo and we were back to unneccessary loudness of projectiles in Zion. I felt nothing, no tinge of sadness and this is the death of a major character. WTF? I had the same reaction to the ending. Beautiful shots but no emotional impact. The humanity that was present in both the original and in some parts of reloaded just disappeared under the dust of CGI and industrial noise.<br/><br/>The only good parts were possibly in the first 3rd of the film.

","I have been a diehard fan of The Matrix from the very beginning; lauding the well-sampled-yet-original storytelling of the 1999 sci-fi film that revolutionized film making as we know it. And I have always been a strong defender of the deceivingly inferior Reloaded as a necessary appendage in a growing trilogy that once again raised the bar on what is possible to view on a screen. I cannot, however, bring myself to defend the monumentous disappointment that is Revolutions. While the sub-par dialogue did have an almost Star Warsesque charm and appeal to the first two Matrix films, the dialogue in Revolutions can be described as nothing less than insulting. Every line is painfully cliche and predictable, the most ""tender"" or ""intense"" moments of the movie are not free of laughter from a crowd who would not (and should not) buy what these characters were actually saying to each other.<br/><br/>The acting in Revolutions was considerably more wooden than in the previous movies (due most likely to the script). The underrated Reeves(My Own Private Idaho, Feeling Minnesota) is reduced, once again, to looking the Ted ""Theodore"" Logan part as he is forced to utter lines like ""I am from the Matrix...er I was...I don't know"". Moss(Memento) gives the worst performance as her lines are the most cliche, one coming late in the movie that cannot avoid hilarity despite the obvious pain and sadness that should be echoing through Matrix fans everywhere. When Trinity confronts the Merovingian, she completely ends a subplot before it can even start simply by pointing a gun and saying ""I don't have time for this s**t!"" The audience is left wondering if a half hour was completely cut from the movie (An obvious writing debacle). Fishburne(Mystic River), the most interesting character of the Matrix franchise, is reduced to being Niobe's(Pinkett-Smith) sidekick. The viewer receives no power from the once proud Morpheus and his character deserved a lot more than what it got in the alleged ""climax"" of the Matrix series.<br/><br/>While it can be correctly stated that the fight scenes in Reloaded were too long at times, it is obvious to me that was because hand to hand combat is almost nonexistent in Revolutions, which is perhaps the most enjoyable part of its predecessors. The ""great showdown"" between Smith and Neo is hard to see due to the oversized rain and the fact that much of it is in the air (along with the many watery explosions that occur during the fight). Other than that, the fight choreography that we all have come to love and mimic over the years is simply not here. All in all, the Smith fight is impressive, but leaves you searching back in time for the glory days when they were merely fighting  in a subway station. Reloaded may of had drawn out fight scenes, but if you see Revolutions, you'll definitely miss them. And while the battle at Zion is very impressive, it pales in comparison to the freeway scene in Reloaded, making the audience believe that the best they're ever going to witness happened in May (and they're absolutely right).<br/><br/>I was once excited at the prospect of seeing one of my favorite movies go into the realm of the epic. And I was still optimistic after Reloaded which, despite its obvious hiccups, posed some awesome revelations, some incredible scenes that truly ""revolutionized"" what an action movie should be, and had an underrated cliffhanger. Revolutions, however, was a complete insult to the diehard Matrix fans with its infantile dialogue and sickeningly predictable storytelling. The twists that happened in Reloaded that you might expect the Wachowski Bros. to bring out in the ""final"" film are just not in there. Keanu Reeves said there would be no need for a fourth installment, ""the story's been told"". But guess what? And I'm speaking to all you horror fans when I say this, you know that when there's money to be made on a product, you should always leave room for more. Revolutions, despite what we've been told since the word ""sequel"" first escaped the cast and crew's lips, does not really finish at all. And I can guarantee there will be more stories to be told in one medium or another. And with the way this one ended, or fizzled out as I should say, I can only sit back and fear the unnamed monster that is going to ruin the good name of The Matrix in the future.

"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","0","0","7 November 2003"," What the hell was that?!?!?!
","BIG SPOILERS<br/><br/>Ok, so I confess, I wasn't an enourmous fan of the 2nd film, but then I fail to see the fuss about the first (yeah it was original, but just because something is original doesn't necessarily make it good), so if your an enourmous fan of the films, perhaps i'm not the best person to read. Anyway, I went into this third installment expecting relatively little. Whilst I enjoyed ""Matrix Reloaded"" the 2nd time I watched it (maybe the same will be true of this one), I found it tedious the 1st time. With this film I've kinda expected the same. So, after the negative expectations, was I surprised? In ways yes.<br/><br/>At this point I'd normally write a brief summary of what happens in this film, but lets be honest, most of you will have watched the first two and could quite possibly have seen the trailer for this, and that's all that is really needed. So I'm going to quickly flick forward to what I liked and what I hated.<br/><br/>Firstly, I do confess, for a lot of this film the graphics were well made, if slightly fast at times, and the fight scenes involving technology never failed to impress me. The almost ""Aliens"" like contraptions which the men at Zion used were quality and I almost wish i had one.<br/><br/>To be honest with you, this could quite easily be the only thing I really enjoyed about this film. There are a few key reasons for this.<br/><br/>""The Matrix Revolutions"" feels ridiculously action packed. Whilst the 2nd was at times slow and painstaking, this film was so fast and paced that it feels almost like the Wachowski (spelling?) Brothers had told their stories and just wanted to cause fights. So ultimately, that's what they've done. During the ultimate final load of battles, whilst the machine battles are taking place, the incredibly tacky fighting between Neo and Agent Smith is almost legendarily bad. I went to see this film with my friend Alex and he'd been told before hand that the fighting felt like something out of ""Dragonball Z"". Well whoever told him that, they weren't far wrong. The two men seemed to zip across the screen in almost depressingly fast shots which were blurred and all in all, relatively weak.<br/><br/>So, other than the fighting, what else can I complain about? Well theres the almost satirical nature of the religious implications. This film feels at times almost like the Brothers got so fed up with the religion comments in regard to the first film that they thought they'd get revenge by putting as many Christian links in as possible. I won't say much on this, but basically, towards the end of the film, you'll know exactly what I mean.<br/><br/>Also, there were times where I felt a bucket was almost compulsory to someones cinema going experience. Your reading something here by someone who rates ""When Harry Met Sally"" as one of his favourite films, and if forced to watch a well-scripted romantic comedy, can tend to stomach it (""Notting Hill"" being an ok example), but there were scenes in this film (most involving Trinity, but not all) which were so ridiculously sickening, that I'm sure I heard someone throwing up on one of the front rows.<br/><br/>To summarise then, I know the Wachowski Brothers faced a lot of problems in their filming (actors getting injured or dying... the Oracle's Death was cleverly delt with by the way), but ultimately I can't help but feeling that they should have left these films after the original (having said that, the ending to the original was pretty weak too), and saved themselves all that unnecessary cost and stress. Go watch this film for the experience (I recommend watching any truely awful film for the cinema experience ...... except ""Crocodile Hunter""), but don't expect too much. Go in, try to shut your brain out to enjoy the action, but most of all, remember your sickbag."

","I say YES! It was a HUGE let down. The effects were top notch. The Dock battle scene reminded me of something straight out of Robotech, and the martial arts style fighting, all top notch as well. However! The end of this story, which had the longest build up of questions and anticipation, was a HUGE let down, IMHO! I was very upset with the deaths of certain characters at the end, but that was the least of my concerns, as I understand such things add drama to the plot. But the ever cryptic questions, and even more cryptic ""answers"" have now ruined the end of the story. Aside from the general knowledge that the war is at an end for now, my friends and I did not understand much of the end. Dont get me wrong, we understood more then the people who sat behind us (they got up and left thirty minutes before the end they were so confused) but it still left a lot of questions up in the air. Over all, I gave this movie a 3 out of 10, for not tying up loose ends, and dropping the story at a bad spot, leaving you with more questions then you came in with."

"antialias11","4","0","0","11 November 2003"," What I expected
","I went to see this movie not because I really anticipated it, but because I had seen the first two and wanted too get it over with.<br/><br/>Action: Matrix are action movies (duh!). Where the first was ground braking in terms of quality, the second was groundbreaking in terms of quantity. The third broke no ground at all. The CG was nice, if a bit stilted in some scenes. I missed any scenes that made me go 'whoa - that was cool'. There was lots of action after the first hour - I'll grant it that. But none really gripped the audience as it was all totally foreseeable (last stand, heroic fight, individuals act bravely, dying command of a hero, last minutes save, some unimportant people die, fall back to last defensive position, enemies behaving stupidly throughout the engagement - they have those nice laser beams - why didn't they use them once? or throw some of their bombs into the dome first...duh.)<br/><br/>Philosophy: All the philosophy that was hinted at in the first movie and which was somewhat continued in the second was blatantly ignored here. Stupid one-liners and questions answered with questions. I must say that what they tried to bite off philosophically would have been more than a dozen movies could chew - but the hype and the extent to which the attempt failed amazed me. <br/><br/>The actors: Hugo Weaving was incredible as always. You can see he is having incredible amounts of fun playing Smith - the man should get an Oscar for best supporting actor. His speeches (at least in Matrix 1&2) and his pronunciation are a feast. As for the others: Trinty actually got me to hate her in this flic. Mostly because she acted like a beaten kitten all the time and due to the interminable death scene. Morpheus/Fishburne was just a subdued little boy reciting his litany 'believe, believe, believe' where he was full of energy in the other movies. Keanu/Neo - lets not go there...if he was the dream-cast for the role then they must have missed the application by a 2x4. The Meregovian - while this character actually had something to say he said the same thing he stated in the second movie over again. Bringing in a number of extra characters was totally superfluous - even if you have seen the Animatrix. Who the hell cared about 'the kid'? What was he there for? Why make him such a big part? Why the trainman? He doesn't do anything for the story. (and the joke in Mobile (=Limbo?) Ave was rather foreseeable/lame. I knew what would happen as soon as the camera stopped following Neo *yawn*.)<br/><br/>To make a long story short: Go rent it on DVD, so that you can at least say you have seen them all. Don't waste your bucks for this."

"Airmark","9","0","0","7 November 2003"," Must see - however its good, not great
","Warning  - minor spoiler or two but not enough to ruin the movie: I have seen a comment suggesting skipping this movie and watching only the first two. That is absurd. How could anyone who saw the first two not want to see the conclusion. However, it is a very different movie than the first two. It's kinda like how ""Aliens"" was a very different movie than ""Alien"" - however they were both very good movies. This is mostly an action movie in the real world (as opposed to inside the Matrix). Most of the Matrix scenes involved the Oracle except for the final Neo vs. Agent Smith showdown (thats not a spoiler you had to expect that to be in the movie). The first was about discovering the matrix world vs. the real world and the second was mostly inside the matrix world. But the real story here is the final battle in Zion with the sentinels against some big bad human weaponry (homage paid to the ""Aliens"" walker Ripley kicked the aliens butt in with some serious gunpower added) and some well placed missiles targeting the diggers. That scene was awesome, a special effects spectacle and a battle of unparalleled sci-fi proportions. However the rest of the movie is somewhat slower, the first half particularly with a lot of talk but not as much philosophy as the first two installments. The film succeeds in one way that the second (understandably) failed which is that it does have a conclusion, a finality. I appreciated the fact that it wasn't ended in a typical Hollywood fashion (it didn't go on and on, wasn't full of false endings, and didn't result in everyone living - minor spoiler). So because of the fact that its not so much philosophy and not occuring so much inside the matrix, it is more of a ""normal"" action sci-fi flick. I suppose some viewers could be surprised by that but they shouldn't be disappointed. Appreciate it for what it is. That said, it does lack the emotional punch and human element some might have hoped for. And its not full of one liners and the usual tricks of a typical action battle movie. Some will take it as a bit dry because of that but I felt it was more realistic - its not a summer blockbuster for the bubblegum audience with effects for effects sake. Its honest, genuine, real, touching but not overly emotional and in the end its all about inevitability and as the oracle said - every thing that has a beginning must have an end - as does this movie trilogy.  A good one, but not a great one."
"jasonz42","5","0","0","7 November 2003"," A potentially great trilogy fizzles out in a poor ending
","The first matrix film was truly incredible, leading the way for a potentially termendous trilogy to rival that of Star Wars. My initial review of reloaded was that it was poor, but after several viewings once i got to understand it more i actually really enjoyed it. Sadly, Revolutions, no matter how many times it is watched, has no hidden depth. The script, what little there is, is predictble and unimaginative, its initial flare and interest is lost through overused cliches and at many points it feels as if we've heard it all before. 'Lesser' characters are used to the detriment of Morhpeus, Agent smith and to some extent neo, meaning there's never any engaging storyline for any one character, more a hatch patch of mini-stories that fail to get you feeling for anyone. In short, action is mindless action with no meaning and it will not do anything but bore you. My second complaint is the effects- if nothing else, surely they should be incredible. Sadly, they're not. Gone are the incredible explosions and cool camera effects of reloaded. No decent chase scene or imaginative FX, just typical blasting and guns. The fight scenes are the worst yet, in fact there is precious amounts of Kung-Fu, instead characters seem to like floating about more like puppets. There were even ocassions where i noticed the actors missing each other and pretending they were hit. The new oracle fails to provide interest and does not do as good a job as the original, which leaves another big hole in the film, where once interesting philosophical points were raised, the 'intellectual' conversations become dull and monotonous.<br/><br/>In general, the matrix revolutions is not a disasterous film, but in comparison to the other two it stands way below par, it has neither the originality or wit of the first, nor the edge-of-your-seat action of the second. Instead it is a poor concuction of both. The truth is, the glitch IS the matrix."

","These negative comments are very surprising.<br/><br/>This was a very good action movie. What distinguishes a good action movie from a bad one can be seen by comparing Reloaded to Revolutions. In reloaded, the fight scenes are completely boring, because the main character is God-like and invincible. You know that he cannot lose, so there is no suspense to keep you gripped or tied into scene. In Revolutions, this is not the case. The main character goes through a series of ups and downs, and is, in the end, not stronger than his enemy, but uses his intelligence to outwit his rival. What a great ending!<br/><br/>Furthermore, while the philosophy and mythology underlying the movie are ""talked about"" to great extents in the second of the triology (a big no no in a visual medium), they are SHOWN through the action in revolutions. The little dialogue goes a long way, i.e. the ""the equation must be balanced""<br/><br/>All in all, very successful end to the triology, and second best in the series."

","If you like fighting scenes with people and car chases, Matrix Reloaded was a better movie. If you are into machine fighting then Matrix Revolutions is for you. The Matrix Revolutions starts off right where Reloaded left off. It does not dissapoint in the category of special effects. Sure the actors dialogues were not the greatest, but come on Neo is Keanu Reeves for god's sake. Although he is the perfect Neo, I am not sure how he pulled such a good job. Anyways, I thought Reloaded was a better movie just because it was my style, but Revolutions was still a good movie. Everyone who has such high expectations of the movie should not. You cannot expect the greatest film of all time. Instead you should expect a good movie with outstanding SPX. This movie is definately worth seeing in the theater just because of the special effects. Sure the Matrix trilogy could have ended in a different and maybe better way, but the final chapter is still a great movie.

","Hey, multimedia geeks!  Yeah, I know you're out there!  Would one of you do us all the favour of editing ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" into a single good movie?  The Wachowskis must've realised they didn't have enough killer stuff to justify two first-rate new Matrices, but, money being there to be made, they went ahead anyway.  This means the last two movies have been marred by far too many dead scenes - tender moments between Neo and Trinity, generating as much heat as a wooden block being rubbed against a plastic block; minor characters from whom the only amusement I could derive was guessing whether or not they'd get squished into machine oil; and stupefyingly misjudged subplots (see, there's the real world, and there's the Matrix, and then there's this other world as well - if Neo thinks he's stuck in a place where nothing's happening, what about the audience?)<br/><br/>So if you geeks would take the highway chase from ""Reloaded"", all of Mr and Mrs Merovingian's scenes, and all the big action sequences from the final hour of this one, and add just enough plot (err on the side of minimalism), you should come up with something that I'd actually watch again.<br/><br/>Still wouldn't be as good as the first one, though.

"ElChivoDave","7","0","0","7 November 2003"," 'Revolution' without resolution? Nothing to resolve?
","It seems so long ago since January, when 2003 was being touted as The Year of The Matrix.  The anticipation of continuing the story from 1999 was the movie hype for the new-year.   There may well be The Return of the King, but there would be two Matrix sequels in six months.<br/><br/>And then, Reloaded came along.  I think it would be foolish to dismiss it entirely, as it boasts some of the most impressive and jaw-dropping special effects sequences (the 100 Agent Smiths, the freeway chase) since, well, The Matrix.  However, the story was so pompously up-its-own-arse and knee-deep in pseudo-philosophy, that somehow the 700 million dollar grossing movie was a disappointment.  A big disappointment.  It wasn't so much the problem that the audience 'didn't get' the Matrix Reloaded, it was that, really, there is not a lot to get.  The Wachowski brothers stretched their one film idea into three, and the story in Reloaded is so incredibly thin (it is, accept it!) that trying to disguise it by giving 'clever'  character-names and philosophising one-liners could never hope to hide the holes that were creeping in.  And this was only part 2.<br/><br/>So, it was somewhat unbelievable, just eleven months down the road from the start of the Year of The Matrix, that the anticipation for the concluding instalment was, in general, lukewarm.  Hotdog magazine ran a telling article title recently - `Game Over? After Reloaded does anyone still care?'.  I did still care, and was no doubt one of many who hoped that Revolutions could finish the trilogy off in style.<br/><br/>Today, my worst fears for the long-term prestige of the Matrix brand have been confirmed.  Revolutions is another disappointment.  I am perfectly happy to allow the thousands of Matrix fans to type away at their message boards trying to find the meanings in this film, relating it to religion, science, and who knows what else.  The thing is, by expanding a basic idea like the first film over three, we lose a lot of the clout that the original idea held for us.  The realization on the part of Neo in the first Matrix was what made the film, for me.  It was a journey into the unknown, a confrontation of it and the naÃ¯ve nature of his existence and his coming-to-terms with it made the story of the first film a decent enough effort.<br/><br/>However, for all their skill as directors, although I for one would even question this (!), the Wachowski brothers are not writers.  Remember the hopeless Stallone-Banderas vehicle of 1995, Assassins.  Who was behind the typewriter that time? The Wachowski brothers.  Bound, 1996, is similarly uninspiring.  Revolutions is almost agonising.  In Reloaded they tried to pull-the-wool over the eyes of audiences by patronising them by calling characters after Greek gods and goddesses, or French rulers.  There is nothing clever in calling a character Persephone.  If anything, it takes much of the hard work away, leaving an on-screen and on-paper one dimensional character to the claws of the obsessed, desperate to find meaning.  And of course, if you name your characters as such there will always be a meaning, and someone will always be able to apply that to the film.  In my opinion, the characterisation of the Matrix is one of the more arrogant and charlatanistic moves in the entire series.<br/><br/>Back to Revolutions in general.  It lumbers on like a comatose donkey for thirty or fourty minutes, maybe longer.  Sitting in the cinema desperately hoping for some saving-grace I was faced with a long wait.  It only really gets going once the attack on Zion begins, and here we find another Wachowksi illusion-effect.  The onslaught rages on for so long that when it is over you forget that for the first forty minutes you were being dragged along slowly and painfully.  Similarly the Agent Smith scenes at the end promise much in the trailer, but come too late and are too ineffective to redeem what has already been lost in the first half of the film.  The screenplay is, again, at times cringe-inducingly bad.  The acting is more wooden than before.  The action seems self-referrential, in a Shrek-parody way, rather than feeling natural to the series, and the action we are presented with is largely what we have seen elsewhere before.  Don't be expecting the bullet-time of the first Matrix, or the 'virtual cinematography' of Reloaded  (whatever this is referring to! Raoul Coutard must be sorry of what has become of his once perfected artform!).<br/><br/>I cannot believe that the Wachowski brothers conceived 'The Matrix' as one grand vision.  After the Matrix it was talk of `well, it was always meant to be three films'.  If this is true, then they need to have a serious rethink of their scriptwriting and storytelling abilities.  True, they had a vision, and a very good one, but this vision could have been and perhaps should have been contained within the first film.  Peter Jackson must be rubbing his hands together with glee.  Now nothing stands in the way of him taking the accolades of the greatest motion picture trilogy of all time.  Quite frankly it is about time something blew Star Wars away.<br/><br/>Remember in 1999, when Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace was surprised by the first Matrix film.   Back then it looked like a new-kid was in town, full of promise and confidence to lead off the most exciting movie trilogy since the early 1980s.  Now, 1999 seems so long ago.   The first film will always be a landmark, a classic moment when something came along and really struck-a-chord and showed us something new and exciting.<br/><br/>However, 2003 will not be remembered as The Year of The Matrix.  Reloaded and Revolutions will no doubt make so much money that The Matrix 4, whatever, will always be a possibility, but for the sake of compromising their original vision I would say enough is enough.  The Matrix concept has been so bastardised by other films and other enterprises that it would be the ultimate tragedy if those responsible for the original greatness of the original were the same responsible for later parody and regurgitation. The Matrix Revolutions is a reasonably good film, an average piece of sci-fi action.  But it is not the conclusion to the saga that many hoped for. Don't be surprised if the only Oscars next year are in the Special Effects department.<br/><br/>The Matrix concept has been 'concluded', and I for one am glad that it has ended before doing any serious damage to the reputation of the original. Or maybe it is too late.<br/><br/>I am well prepared for the Matrix-philes who will rally against me for 'missing-the-point' and being ignorant.  To them I say, as a piece of cinema the Matrix trilogy offers nothing besides innovative effects.  I think it is far more ignorant to seek meaning that is not necessarily there and to convince oneself that the things we might not understand are therefore complex and intelligent.  Accept the Matrix as what it is, what it was, not what it 'might' be about or is 'actually' about."

Zion is just one city and can't hold all of the billions of people who will be freed.  Why were the twins not in the film?  Why were the Merovingian and Persephone not in the film more?  They were in the film for only a couple of minutes!  Morpheus didn't seem to have much of a purpose.  Why did Neo have to call Trinity Trin?  That was cheesy.  The Neo Smith fight wasn't as good as any of the previous fights between the two.  I hated that line ""You were right Smith, you were always right.""  What a wussy thing to say!

It's a good idea but not executed as well as it could have been.<br/><br/>The stuntwork and special effects in Revolutions are IMHO the best of any movie yet produced (LOTR series notwithstanding).  The level of detail invested in every visual element is amazing, and the CG animators did a superb job at creating a very real sense of size in this one.  The big drilling machines really seem HUGE.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing this one.

"jasonz42","5","0","0","11 November 2003"," Great potential which it never achieved
","The Matrix Revolutions is by far the worst in the series, with inferior special effects when compared to reloaded and a lesser script and storyline to the original. In fact, I found the script so predictable I was saying phrases before the actors- which doesn't make for a particularly interesting film. That's the main problem with revolutions, it simply isn't interesting. No amount of FX or cool sequences will provoke interest unless a clever script and character development is built up. Whereas the other two fim's scripts were at least interesting (some of the philosophical discussions were just fantastic!), this film has none of these and instead tries to tie up everything the last two films did, which it doesn't even do very well.<br/><br/>Sadly, it seems as if the Wachowski brothers had a massive budget leftover and decided to skip conversation sequences and replace them with computer-induced fight scenes, some of which are still dodgy. The new oracle is not as good an actor as previous, Reeves still acts poorly, and Fishbourne and Weaving, who held the films together previously, are given precious little to do this time around. In conclusion, the Matrix Revolutions had the potential to finish off this fantastic series in spectacular fashion, instead, not only did they limp to the finish post, that didn't even explain half the story anyway, leaving you coming away with a feeling that the Matrix is the glitch."
"lost4wurds","Null","0","0","7 November 2003"," Better than Reloaded, but that's not saying much
","Let me start by saying that I liked the first film. It wasn't the best movie of all time like some would contend, but the film was an overall 7/10. Reloaded was a terrible farce of a movie with little in the way of story and so many pointless uneccesary scenes that it still makes my head spin to this day. I went to Revolutions with the hope that I was just completely wrong about the second movie, that in this one all of those things that made little to no sense about the last film would be explained and there would have been a lot of ""Oh Yeah!"" moments. I was sadly mistaken. I can say a few good things about Revolutions. 1. The special effects were awesome. 2. (And my biggest gripe from the last film) Every action taken in the movie had a point. And 3. Independently many of the scenes in the movie were fantastic, from the final battle with Smith to the journey to 01, but they just weren't enough to make the film worthy of seeing.<br/><br/>Now for the bad stuff. The dialogue was terrible. The acting was laughable with everybody making deliveries like they had no emotion (maybe to offset the fact that Keanu can't act to save his life). And the story was terrible with unexplained resolutions that leave you scratching your head. What's the deal with the train from the Matrix to our world?? Where exactly does that let off and are the tooth fairy and Santa Claus somehow involved? It's crap like that which fills this movie. Why on Earth would a machine, a logical being obesessed only with self preservation, ever make an agreement with it's one true enemy and hold to that agreement like it had some sense of honor?? The film was beter than the last, but that's only because the last film was terrible and a 3/10 at best.<br/><br/>Go see the film, because you have to. Hell, you've already invested so much of your life on this crap. Just don't expect such simple things as acting, dialogue, and a story that makes sense. Oh and forget everything you may know about reality, because the matrix has very little to do with what's real and possible (and not in a good way). 5/10"
"goodweisa","9","0","0","7 November 2003"," Great Movie, Interesting Thoughts (SPOILERS)
","Hi all....i finally saw this movie today and i thought it was a spectacular ending to a great trilogy.  However, there are a couple of things i picked up on that i have not yet seen mentioned on these boards.<br/><br/> 1.) When Neo is in the train station the address is MOBIL AVE.  Rearrange MOBIL and you have LIMBO.  Not a major part of the film, but just another anagram the Wachoswki brothers threw into the movie.<br/><br/> 2.) Also dealing with the train station scene.  Go back and watch Reloaded scene 17 at 1:05 seconds - Neo walks in to speak with the Merovingian. Before he actually speaks with him, Neo makes eye contact with a man leaving the Merovingian.  This man is the Indian father at the train station.  He must have just concluded his deal with Merovingian when Neo walks in.....<br/><br/> The movie itself was fantastic, i think some people are disappointed in that they did not completely understand everything at play. Here is my take on the movie.<br/><br/> Oracle - during the ingenious dialog scene at the end of Reloaded the Architect mentions that 'she is the mother of the Matrix'.  Neo responds with 'the Oracle' and the Architect shrugs it off with a 'Please'.  The architect is discrediting her in this scene, but in truth as we find out at the end of revolutions, she is in fact the mother of the matrix.<br/><br/> Overall the battle was between the Oracle and the Architect.  They were the ones who manipulated everyone.  The Oracle knew she could not defeat the Architect and the machines, nor would she want too - being a program herself she also wanted to survive.  The only way to battle the machines and architect was to create another program who she could guide in defeat, thus Neo.  Both of her goals were accomplished in that the humans who wished to be pulled from the Matrix would be and she could go on living in the Matrix. Even though it took six versions of Neo to accomplish her goal she eventually did it.  The Architect promises the Oracle all humans wishing to be extracted from the Matrix will be. Remember his comment at the end of the film 'What do you think I am? Human?'  The Oracle also knows that Smith will become Neo's negative force or opposing force, which as she planned from the beginning would be the way to compromise the machines and their power.  As the Architect also says at the end of revolutions - 'You've played a dangerous game' It's the Oracle's risk of Neo ultimately defeating Smith to save the humans who wish to be saved. If that risk fails, everything is destroyed.  Ironically enough (or not????) it's Smith's version of the Oracle who fights against Neo in the fantastic battle scene at the end of the movie. Smith had already infected the entire Matrix by the time Neo fights him. Creating a truce between machines and man was the only way for the two to live in peace and the Oracle was the only one who could see this. Even though the Architect can't understand the choice the machines were given, the machines had to make the choice of allowing Neo to fight Smith, otherwise the machines would have been destroyed by Smith as well."

","True inspiration can be spoiled by forcing ideas too hard and too fast. Inspiration can also be destroyed when it's forced at the wrong time. Sometimes ideas need to be sat on, culled over, and perfected before they are foisted on the general public. True art takes time.<br/><br/>
In the case of THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, it has one really huge mark against it.  That is that it was shot back to back with RELOADED.  So while the brothers Wachowski were able to up the ante that they set with the original MATRIX RELOADED, REVOLUTIONS has nowhere left to go.  While this film is creative and visually stunning, it feels like a lot of the same thing. George Lucas did one thing correctly with his STAR WARS films being spaced three years apart. He was able to create new and stunning visual effects with technology that he only dreamed of with the previous films.<br/><br/>In REVOULTIONS Neo (Keanu Reeves, The Replacements) and his `Superfriends' are back where we left them.  Fighting the endless war with the robots. You see where we last left the human race the robots were drilling into the last human city, and the dark suited Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, Babe) was running amok inside and in this installment outside of the Matrix.  As the war to save the human race commences, it's up to Neo to prove he's `THE ONE'.<br/><br/>REVOLUTIONS can be summed in one word: UNDERWHELMING.  There is nothing new, nothing exceptionally cool, or anything of consequence going on.  In fact except for the tail end of one really neat action sequence, (that's too difficult to explain without ruining some vital plot points) the film has no suprises.<br/><br/>In fact the first hour of the film renders the last hour of RELOADED utterly pointless, it merely ties up some loose ends and you begin to wonder why they were introduced in the first place.<br/><br/>It also squanders Lambert Wilson's funny and sadistic Merovigian, and Monica Bellucci's Persphone.  They are in the film for mere moments.  I can only surmise that its because the Wachowski's thought it would be cool to visit them again.  This entire scene proves is how unnecessary they were in RELOADED and I liked them in that one. (As a side note this scene also includes a moment that earns this film it's R-rating.  Yes this is a PG-13 film with a moment in which a male extra grabs and tweaks a female extra's breast.  Why?  I'm not quite sure I wanna to know.)<br/><br/>As with the other two films REVOLUTIONS has a backbone of stunning special effects.  While they look really good, they lack the creative spark that made the first MATRIX groundbreaking and it's sequel a joy to watch. REVOLUTIONS spends it time tying up the story and forgetting the tradition of not only stunning but also magical special effects.  The race to Zion sequence is the only segment that half works, and even the final showdown just kind of ends.  It should be awesome and it elicits only half the awe of the amazing final battle in the first Matrix or the breathtaking final shots of the Highway chase in RELOADED.<br/><br/>I just wonder how much better this film could be had it been made on its own two or three years down the road.  What amazing visuals could have been created? What interesting philosophies could have been dreamed up?  What new and unusual characters could have been conjured?  We'll probably never know, and I guess I can deal with that, but I do want to.<br/><br/>To be fair THE MATRIX REVOULTIONS is still leaps and bounds above typical action movies.  It's full of enough eye candy to keep and action junky busy for a while.  I still intend to see this film on the IMAX screen, an experience that greatly improved the last film as well.  As it stands I probably wouldn't recommend this film to a casual moviegoer, or a sci-fi enthusiast.  But for fanboys and action buffs you just might like it.<br/><br/>

","ALERT SPOILERS ALERT SPOILERS<br/><br/><br/><br/>I remember coming out of that second Matrix on a cool June night with my friends, my dad, and my brother. We were excited... the movie was confusing, not quite as groundbreaking as the first... but we had so many questions! There were answers, and we expected them to come in the great Third Movie.<br/><br/>I saw Revolutions... and not only did it not answer my previous questions, I have more than I did before.<br/><br/>I miss The Matrix. I mean, the world itself. This movie was too dark... the Matrix somehow became populated by a bunch of Agent Smiths. Did he take over the whole thing... in Matrix Reloaded he just had about 100 men, and now it looks like he's taken over everything? How did that all happen in 24 hours? Did all of his men start creating more Smiths? Or can only he copy himself into others?<br/><br/>This movie lacked any real substance... there were some good action/fight scenes, but they really didn't tie together too well at all. Neo's fight with Smith was cool.. but it lost the appeal of the first two movies. It seemed more like they were dancing around in the sky than trying to fight each other.<br/><br/>The Battle with Zion was amazing, but it didn't really add anything to the movie. It seemed like we knew the humans were going to lose no matter what. Though that huge swarm of sentiles. That was really nice to watch. I would say the Battle of Zion is the best part of this whole movie, but the problem is they added too many minor characters and shrunk many of the major parts.<br/><br/>Morpheus has gone from some super-hero to a low-ranking captain on a ship. Naobi is the only interesting character added since the first movie. A lot of the characters added in the last two movies have just seemed to be there to add more challenge to the plot and make the movies longer.<br/><br/>They could have easily made these two sequels into one and cut out a lot of the unimportant crap and some characters.<br/><br/>It seems like a lot of the characters they added are just like random encounters in a Final Fantasy video game, annoying, repetitive, and they slow down the plot.<br/><br/>The ending didn't seem to end it. The architect says, ""Those who choose to be free, will be."" Or something like that.<br/><br/>I found it mediocore. I know there are some people, mostly teenagers, who think this movie is ""mind-blowingly awesome."" You know the type. They talk like they have smoked a lot of marijuana when they haven't, and they describe everything as ""totally deep."" I didn't get the ""deeper meaning"" of this movie... except that I think it could have been better."

","After seeing Reloaded, my expectations for Revolutions were lowered, I realized that the Wachowski's weren't going to be able to make good on all the promises and expectations from the first movie. But that being said, I still was looking forward to see how they wrapped up the story. I just never imagined it would be this stupid. Truly a disappointment...<br/><br/>This movie draws from so many different genres, philosophies, archetypes, cliches, etc that it becomes boring and pretentious. The Wachowski's shoot for the moon but miss horribly. You can't say they didn't try though, they have a very visually entertaining and original style. Revolutions is visually appealing (most of the CGI in the movie is very well done), but their storytelling still needs some work. They try to handle multiple storylines and characters with the attention span of Michael Bay movie instead of the meticulous care of a Robert Altman movie.<br/><br/>Revolutions is not a complete failure, there are many scenes that work well. These involve more of the subtle and surreal aspects of the story (ie the ending sequence in machine city, the deeper look into how the matrix program works or the exploration of the moral philosophies of sentient artificial beings). The epic, patriotic, and sappy aspects of the story however do not work well (ie the ending mech battle or the overdramatic love story). And what's with the cheesy one-liners and thinking-aloud statements? I spent half the movie laughing at the rediculous ways the characters acted and spoke.<br/><br/>It's obvious that the Wachowski's are extremely talented, hopefully now they will start using that talent on good original material (and maybe they'll take some writing classes too).

Was this the great climax we were all promised? NO-WAY! First off, did you all forget the first movie? Do you remember how brilliant the concept was? Neo was, for the most part, all of us-the audience. He/we awoke to the notion that everything we take for granted in life is false; and that in essence he/we is the savior of the planet. A sort of suedo christ; and we're invited to see a new reality, which is reality! Whoa! Then we're promised that we will end an age long struggle, a war that has been going on for two hundred years, and that we will free the human race and bring peace to earth.<br/><br/>Yeah, right.<br/><br/>In the end of Revolutions, I was left asking a very simple, but poignant question: 'What the hell happened to all that?'<br/><br/>I mean, the war didn't end. Neo didn't save the planet. All he did was give the humans of Zion a bit more time. If anything, the only real winners were the machines themselves. They got to cause Zion a whole lot of damage, they also got to elimanate the potentially threating Smiths, and most of the people are still enslaved.<br/><br/>I mean, isn't this the same point the humans were at before they met Neo? Aren't they still struggling to survive? Wasn't the point in the beginning to save all the humans in the in those fields? I didn't think it was merely to save their own hides in Zion and make some lame (temporary) truce. But apparently it was!<br/><br/>Basically, all I was left with is the same disappointing fact I was left with when I saw the Starwars prequels; Hollywood sci-fi writers can't write! I mean I heard so many better scenerios from fans like us than what the 'What-ever' brothers came up with in the end. I mean even Morpheous should've been like; 'That's it? The machines aren't destroyed? All we're left with is alot less humans in Zion and a whole lot of clean-up?!'<br/><br/>I'm sorry guys. I know alot of you want to like this movie. I did too, but how can we forgive such shoddy writing when it's the same guys who wrote the brilliant first Matrix. And by the the way, they had COMPLETE creative control in this one.

These Ideals, Stories and Moral Systems, based on very early Christian and Buddhist philosophies and belief systems, have been revealed to some of us at very early ages and have been pressed upon us as a moral compass and overall vision of how we should and should not interact with one another in order to achieve the peace and/or shelter from evil/sin that we so desperately need.<br/><br/>What is it that began in a Galaxy Far, Far Away? What is it that gave us the choice between a Red Pill and a Blue Pill? What is it that continues to make us answer such questions as - Would I be able to destroy the One Ring?<br/><br/>Star Wars - Lord of the Rings - The Matrix. These are our new philosophies. These are our new mythologies.<br/><br/>The stories they tell are full of characters that we are familiar with because their traits are not unlike our own and faced with the same opportunities and obstacles might we choose the same path as they had?<br/><br/>Of course, if we do end up applying any of what we have learned from these stories the story tellers themselves will have been successful in their task, all the way from Plato and Aristotle to George Lucas, J.R.R. Tolkien and the Wachowski Brothers.<br/><br/>It's just my opinion but I don't think I'm far off the mark on this one. All I know is - I've learned more about faith, hope and love from ancient philosophies revisited in recent films than any other medium, ever.<br/><br/>Just a thought."

","First of all ý must say that ý like this movie.I accept that it isn't as good or deep as the first two movies.But it achieves its first goal:entertaining us.With its great action scenes <the war in Zion or the brain-smashing fight between Agent Smith and Neo>,you will barely breath.And if you succeed to put the philoshopy side away <certain that this is impossible>,you will think that you watched one of best action<br/><br/>movies of the all times. About the philoshopy side,the movie continues to discuss the same issues in the second movie:machines that are getting human feelings and their point of view about these things like love,existence.This discussion started in the first movie when we heard Agent Smith told Morpheus that he hated MATRIX and he was searching to way to zion to get out of that unreal world.Then in the second movie we saw programs like Agent Smith and Keymaker which trying to continue their existence in spite they are programed to be ended and they were fighting between each other,too <like humans,when a program or a machine gets its intelligence,it doesn't take a step back about attacking to another programs or machines>.And in this movie we learn the human feelings that programs have and what they think about them <for example they don't consider love as a feeling>.before Matrix in BLADE RUNNER,RIDLEY SCOTT discussed the same issue.But Scott was more dramatic like the SPIELBERG in A.I..WACHOVSKY BROTHERS are more like KUBRICK in 2001;more specific. On the other hand it really has big spaces in the things it brought from RELOADED.For example they don't say anything more about the ARCHITECT and the talk between him and Neo or the identity of ORACLE.And about the 'MERV'.We just see Matrix in the beginning of the film;the talk between 'Merv' and 'TRINITY,MORPHEUS and SERAPH' and in the end we see it captured by Agent Smith.We see everyone turned into Agent Smith.But we don't know how he got a strong program like 'MEROVINGIAN'.Didn't he resist it's just one of the space ý said. Someone can say that there is too much romance and love.But isn't a new thing:There was love in the huge dance scene of RELOADED,too.Because WACHOVSKY BROTHERS are still taking referances from the ideologies they took in the first MATRIX;budism and tasavvuf.For example the biggest ideologist of tasavvuf;MEVLANA says that 'when you start to love the created you will start the to love the creator,this will save you from the unreal world that you are in'. Finally ý say that it is a quite movie.Just before you see the movie don't tell yourselves you are gonna love it or hate it.Wonderful action but middle-class philoshopy.And to the men who saying that last two movies aren't neccessary:It's obvious from the beginning that there<br/><br/>would be more and ý think they did it well.From the white rabbit in the hole to the sarcastic end of Neo it is a thing to see"

","In the Matrix series, the Wachowski brothers pay tribute to many literary and film works. They stitch it all together, throw in some humor, invent effects, make it their own creation and serve it all up as an enjoyable package.<br/><br/>It is probably not possible to enjoy these films to their full extent without a grounding in classic science fiction, knowledge of computer programming constructs, some familiarity with various religions and a ""tongue in cheek"" sense of humor.<br/><br/>Possible spoilers below.<br/><br/>To be specific, all three films draw heavily on a 1970 radio play, ""I Think We're All Bozos on This Bus"" by The Firesign Theater. One scene in The Matrix Revolutions is a nod to the 1950 AJ Deutch story ""A Subway Named Moebius"".<br/><br/>The programming constructs of assignment and independent and dependent variables vs fuzzy logic are presented as necessary components in the realities of The Matrix. Logic and antilogic are also presented as a way to maintain balance. The notion of compiler-compilers is used so that programs can produce programs giving rise to the next generation of software.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions also tips its hat to Star Wars, Dune, Alien, Robocop and Toshiro Mifune. And I knew that I had seem that body armor before... Wasn't it just in Spy Kids 3D?<br/><br/>Clearly this is a movie for grownups. The action is slick, the effects are amazing, the imagery is great. While it is a flawed movie, some scenes are too long and some minor points are left unresolved, overall this is a movie with humor and content and many ideas to tickle the mind.<br/><br/>Many thanks to the Wachowski brothers for an enjoyable romp! 8 out 10"

","Here is wisdom:  Everything that has a beginning has an end.  A long, plodding, painfully drawn-out end.  Here is more wisdom: Some things are better left to the imagination.  There is no spoon.<br/><br/>The Matrix trilogy limps to an less-than-satisfying conclusion in The Matrix Revolutions, which makes a lot of the same mistakes that made Reloaded such a disappointment.  How did this happen?  The first movie was so cool, so exhilarating.  It nodded politely to all its blended sources, before pouring them all together and creating its own intriguing story, with layers of reality stacked helter-skelter.  It created a sensation, defined moviemaking for a generation, and inspired musings by fans ranging from obscure ramblings on websites (um, hi there) to doctoral theses.  Forget The Phantom Menace - The Matrix was the real successor to Star Wars. And that, I think, is the problem. The Matrix series has become so intent on itself as post-modern myth that it forgets to be fun.  Both sequels ratcheted up the mumbo-jumbo while discarding the endearingly loopy pseudo-religiosity that gave the first movie its charm. They increase complexity and reduce joy.  There is no reason whatsoever why the sequels should turn out to be more talky than the first one, which had to set up the whole scenario in the first place, but that's exactly what happened.<br/><br/>I won't bother too much with plot summary, especially since it's so convoluted and strange, expanding on the revelations in Reloaded about the nature and history of the Matrix.  Anyway, the Bad Guys are still on their way to trash Zion, and Agent Smith is still replicating like a crazed Xerox machine in a bid to take over the Matrix.<br/><br/>Revolutions, like Reloaded, errs in setting comparatively little action inside the Matrix itself.  The Matrix, and the heroes' ability to distort its reality to their advantage, was the element that made the original stand out, and gave it the wow factor that made it a modern classic.  It's the series' best card, but they seem reluctant to play it.  It was far more dramatically effective to dream of Zion than to see it, and that was before we knew that it looked like some kind of industrial-park hippie commune.  There is too much of Zion in Revolutions, too much of its unwashed squalor, its strange caveman fetish, and the stuffy school board that runs it (including Cornel West, whose acting skills suggest he should stick to extorting money from Harvard, or Princeton, or whatever school he's milking now).<br/><br/>But Reloaded gave us a nifty car-chase set piece to partially redeem itself for being so dull and earnest.  Revolutions instead gives us a slug-match at the rusty gates of Zion between invading robo-squids and the goofily impractical weaponry of Zion's defense forces.  I need to talk about these for a sec - they have these giant robot frames with machine guns in each hand, but with no targeting system or any kind of shielding for the operator.  Who designed these things?  Undertakers?  The fight scene itself is big and loud, and not without visual dazzle, but it's nothing you haven't already seen, and better.  The in- Matrix theatrics are limited to a floor-to-ceiling shootout in the basement of a nightclub, and the final fistfight showdown between Neo and Agent Smith. They are amazing scenes of technical artistry, but then they're over.<br/><br/>The Matrix series provided the perfect vehicle for Keanu Reeves, who is, to put it kindly, not a deep actor.  Reeves has made the most of his spacey quality, and turns his flatness into an impressive sort of Zen charisma.  There's really no other actor who could have pulled it off as well.  And though she is more talented, he and Carrie-Anne Moss do have a certain quiet chemistry together. The real disappointment in Revolutions is Laurence Fishburne.  He was perfectly cast as the inscrutable master, communicating wisdom and self- possession, with just the right leavening of humor.  In Reloaded, he had that awful scene where he bellowed that weird speech on the rock in Zion -<br/><br/>Morpheus should never have to raise his voice - but his freeway sword battle was thrilling.  By Revolutions Fishburne looks pudgy and spent, and doesn't get any good scenes.  It's as if Morpheus is so far past his prime that they only keep him around out of pity.<br/><br/>There's still Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith.  Weaving's unmistakable stilted line deliveries have become part of film lore, perfectly capturing the sense that something about the world was slightly. . .off, and one of the subtle signs that the machines' understanding of humanity was incomplete.  In Revolutions Smith is working solo, and becoming a threat to human and machine alike.  He has an entourage of clones, though the effect is more comic than chilling.<br/><br/>Revolutions also sees the return of the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and his chilly consort (Monica Bellucci).  I never understood these characters' purpose, and still don't.  Their presence in the second movie seemed like an unnecessary detour, but one imagined they were being introduced because they would become significant by series' end.  They don't - they actually get less screen time in the final chapter than the second.  This is probably just as well, since whenever they were on screen in Reloaded, it stopped the movie dead.<br/><br/>The ending is obtuse, and leaves you going, `Well, NOW what?'  If the Wachowskis hadn't announced that the trilogy was ended, I would think they were leaving themselves open for a fourth movie (`The Matrix Obfuscations', perhaps).<br/><br/>This review ended up being little more than a litany of complaint.  But mulling over the movie, one thing was clear: I wish they had just left the first movie alone.  A bad sequel is a kind of betrayal, as any fan of `Robocop' or `The Hidden' will tell you. Oh, well, while I'm at it, here's a prediction off the top of my head: the next Star Wars movie, when it finally comes out, is gonna suck too.  You're welcome."
"Gmanol01","10","0","0","7 November 2003"," Excellent action but with philosophy in slight disarray...
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** The Matrix saga got its start by using excellent graphical action combined with an interesting concept of existentialism. However, with the subsequent sequels, the action intensifies while the philosophy behind the movie begins to stray from its original premise.<br/><br/>In the beginning, we as humans were enslaved to provide the machines' necessary power to live. Machines created a fantasy world for us ""slave children"" to live in while we grow to produce more power for them. So, the general premise was that we were the ""brain-in-the-vat"", trapped in a preconceived situation and oblivious to our actual lives. The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions seem to stray from this theory as we are introduced to the concepts of causality and free will. What is perceived for us to do vs. our own desire to do what we feel like doing at the present moment. Many people I have discussed this merger with have agreed that the movie does begin to send the audience into disarray. I was disappointed with the change of topic from the Matrix to Reloaded as I wanted there to be a continuous of the same interesting topic. However, the movie does well to obscure this change with its overly verbose explanations of existence and the cause of it, especially with the solliloquies by the Oracle at the park right before the legion of Agent Smiths ambush Neo. Revolutions does well to continue this with its philosophy as well. Revolutions does live up to everything it was billed for. ""While Reloaded deals with life, Revolutions deals with death"". The way the Wachowski brothers interpreted everyone's death in Revolutions was utterly brilliant as Neo's ""ONE""ness became very apparent. We all find out why Neo was so special, so special as to be given the fate of the universe in his hands.<br/><br/>So, as I entered the movie theatre to watch Matrix Revolutions, I was expecting to see much of the same action/philosophy as was present in Reloaded since they were filmed together. I was correct in that assumption as the action was utterly amazing and the concepts were very contuinuous from Reloaded. I had read in many magazines that the crew were going to unveil some very unique new bullet-time scenes and other very revolutionary action scenes.<br/><br/>*POSSIBLE SPOILERS* (read on at your own risk) =============================================> The clips that stole the show and possible the whole saga is the fight for the dock in Zion and the ending fight between Agent Smith and Neo. The music montage picked to represent the whole scene for the survival of the humans was amazing. The play up to the EMP Shcokwave finally being blown was and will be a historic scene in cinematic visual history. The legion of machines that were on screen all at once made it even more amazing as you could see that it had to have taken a lot of time and effort to make.<br/><br/>The final fight between Agent Smith and Neo was also a piece of cinematic history. Many people do not know how or why Agent Smith became the ultimate of ultimate bas guys. I have an obcure explanation but you had to have seen Reloaded in order to understand. In Reloaded, it was either the Architect or the Oracle (I forgot since it's been quite a few months since I've seen it), Neo was told about the Matrix and that it's just a bunch of code. Neo was a ""renegade program"" that could withstand much more maliciousness than normal ""programs"". Agent Smith was Neo's opposite. Smith was an ""evil"" renegade program, duplicating himself in order to try to take over all other programs. The Oracle is another code that isn't governed by normal programming methodology. That is why she has so much insight into everything, because she has the point of view of God. Agent Smith taking over the Oracle was his way of becoming a very powerful person. He now has the power of Neo, but also the point of view of God. He can see the future and he can act almost like God. That is why the machines let Neo fight Smith - because Smith has become a force that could even take down the machine world! However, in the final fight scene, we see Smith trying to take over Neo and become a supreme being. Neo's desire and perseverence and love and his charisma and his etc. that was been building up throughout the saga has given him something that Agent Smith never had... the will to be free. We are in control of our own world and nothing can take that way. I saw it a bit blasphemous as I think this movie gives Christian theology a slap in the face. It says God doesn't even have the power to rule over us. That is why Neo rejects Smith and destroys every copy of himself.<br/><br/>The fight scene before that was brilliant. It was almost like two ""Superman""s fighting each other, but the whole ""the fate of the world is hanging in the balance"" environment was very well made. I was on the edge of my seat while I as watching the awesome eye candy.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie was an overall awesome ending to the movie. I love movies that give something for the viewer to think about. Don't look for there to be a sequel to this one, but there could be television shows or something that will continue on the story. Agent Smith has been destroyed. However, Agent Smith took over the Oracle's body and she was seen at the end again. Could the same happen with Neo? Perhaps, but hopefully not in theatres. The whole saga was awesome (if it not were for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it would probably be the best trilogy ever). After the first Matrix, the philosophy began to waiver a little bit but it was at least consistent after that until the ending which pretty much makes up for any faults. The action was second to none and will always be benchmark of any other graphical accomplishments. I gave this movie a perfect 10, not only because of the great effort that went into this movie, ut because it was very entertaining and thrilling all at once. Thank you for such an awesome ride Wachowski brothers!"
"San Franciscan","Null","0","0","7 November 2003"," Well okaaaaay... it was kind of fun to watch, I guess...
","This isn't exactly what I had expected.<br/><br/>As I believe I have stated in my review for THE MATRIX RELOADED, I'm not a huge Matrix fan. I thought the series was interesting and entertaining to toy with, though. And once you got into them, both of the first movies were really a lot of fun. And this is the only one of the three I bothered to see in theatres.<br/><br/>I have the feeling that MATRIX fans are going to be really annoyed with this one. Certainly the crowd I saw it with was rowdy and hyped up when they walked in and took their seats; but they all left in stiff silence.<br/><br/>Warning: spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, I didn't dislike this movie. I'm glad I saw it, it was interesting to see how the Brothers W chose to end it. And I was really enjoying the first half of the movie during all those scenes taking place within the Matrix, which are done with both action and humour. Plus, the whole idea of programs that could love and care for others on a human level was fascinating and I was anxious to see it developed later in the film (unfortunately, it never is). I loved every bit they came up with in the Matrix world and hoped for more.<br/><br/>But the moment we all got into the real world scenes (which were inevitable after all; we did know right from the beginning that they have to face the machines in a big one-on-one eventually), certain questions started nagging at me. While a part of me was getting after myself for questioning all this stuff and thinking, ""Hey, it's just a sci-fi film! Why bother puzzling over this stuff?"", I nevertheless couldn't help wondering:<br/><br/>* Where is the rest of the fleet? All throughout THE MATRIX RELOADED, we kept getting informed about how important it was to have ""every single available ship"" ready for when Zion would come under attack. So where are they all?<br/><br/>* Why are the humans using giant mechanical robot bodies to fight back at the machines instead of a more humanized way? Well, I suppose it makes sense to give them fair-and-square abilities to pit them against the machines, and I think that's also the reason why we kept getting shots of common shells being used, but still...<br/><br/>* If a single shell can take out a huge guargantuan enemy machine, then why has the war lasted so long?<br/><br/>* Why do the mechanical robot arms the humans use have simple oversized machine guns in them when the humans also have those deadly blue-laser-firing devices we've seen in both the first movie and this one? Wouldn't it make more sense to simply have those lasers installed instead since they're obviously so effective? Or arming everybody with them? Or were there simply not enough to go around?<br/><br/>Well, I could go on and on, but eventually after a while I simply stopped caring and just struggled to enjoy the movie on its own level. And it is enjoyable, its plusses outweigh its minuses in my mind.<br/><br/>
But by the time we reach the end, I had a ton of whoppers entering my mind throughout the oddly inconclusive finale! Simply put, this film ended up creating far more questions than it answered. Here are a handful of them:<br/><br/>* At the end of the movie we are told the ""others"" who ""chose to"" are allowed to go free. Is this in reference to the programs escaping to the Matrix? Or the humans? Or BOTH?<br/><br/>* Have all the humans been freed, leaving the Matrix a haven for escaping human-acting programs to escape to and live in?<br/><br/>* If the humans have not been freed, how are they given the choice? I mean, is someone going to bother explaining to them the whole situation so they can choose or what?<br/><br/>And much, much more.<br/><br/>You see what I mean? I think the point I'm getting at here is that this movie isn't really interested in presenting us with answers so much as it is with piling on even more questions. That would have been fine if the first two movies didn't seem so determined to promise us a definite resolution by the trilogy's end. But in this case, I see this ending as the result of only one of two possibilities: either the Brothers W had simply painted themselves into a corner until it was apparent that *NO* resolution was going to tie up all the loose ends they had introduced by now, or they were simply so determined to leave the door open for additional sequels and franchises like books, comics, etc. that they tossed their audience out the window in favour of addon (and thus more moneymaking) possibilities.<br/><br/>In either case, it's obvious the Brothers W apparently just do not want their series to end and are determined to keep it going because they like it too much.<br/><br/>I should note that the big centerpiece battle against the machines is extremely wearing on the senses. Simply put, the scene as a whole simply does not ""read"" properly--that's a term we in the industry use to refer to how naturally the human eye is capable of perceiving what is supposed to be happening on the screen. In this case, it's physically impossible to follow everything upon a first-time viewing simply because it's simply all too much at once. COOL WORLD was so visually overwhelming and loud that people in the audience literally felt exhausted, got headaches and starting saying aloud that they wish they had some aspirin: the big battle scene here makes COOL WORLD feel like a cakewalk. Other filmmakers such as George Lucas are not only capable of choreographing their battles much more logically in terms of being able to be followed, but they also have the good sense to cut back and forth between various battles so that one scene doesn't grow wearing from dragging on and on too long. Unfortunately, the Brothers W turn out to be lousy editors in this sense, and they allow the whole bit to be so busy, so loud, so blurry, so confusing and so flat out and out grey-black-blue-aqua that I kept squinting at the screen the way I do when driving through a bad snowstorm. It was horrendous, and it comes close to making the movie self-destruct.<br/><br/>Now on a more positive note, the movie does inject very human situations and elements into the previously-already-established characters that make the film feel more believable than the usual sci-fi outing. Characters dying and such are elements to be expected, but Neo's being permanently BLINDED was not! This is not usually the sort of thing you see happen in movie trilogies, a well-known character being blinded for life in something like a sci-fi romp usually just isn't done because it's all too disturbing to the audience: something like sight is a precious thing, and it violently jerks the audience back to reality as such an element not only immediately reminds them of how eyesight loss can happen to anyone, but also of those out there who are physically unable to watch movies at all. But even though I'm not so sure it was a good idea to have such an ingredient here, give the Brothers W a good strong mark here for taking a risk in trying to up the drama and challenge for our protagonist.<br/><br/>In the end, I had had a good time watching the movie. But I felt empty and disappointed due to all of the previously-mentioned points. It had felt like you were listening to a teenager reading aloud a ""Choose Your Own Adventure Book"" you already knew by heart--and you knew that they had just managed to choose the most thoroughly blah ending in the entire ""ending"" selection when you knew there were so many cooler ones out there they could have picked instead."

","Matrix revolutions was a ton better than the previous move, but is still pales in comparison to the original Matrix.<br/><br/>Basically what happened is they decided to create a great story and focus on that. And, on this premise it does very well. It wasn't the ending that I wanted, but it was still very good and was very engrossing. Overall, I gave this movie a 9, as it was really entertaining.<br/><br/>My complaint was, not lack of action, like some others stated, but lack of really cool camera action. The Matrix had great original camera angles that mimicked comic book shots. Examples were a camera angle shot through the crook of Trinity's arms, reflections of Neo off sunglasses and spoons, etc. Toward the ending it had one real cool comic book shot (excellent, btw), but that was it. This disappointed me as this movie decided to focus on story and forgot about all those cool camera tricks that were introduced in the first Matrix."

It was the ""catharsis"". It was the third act of a movie, that wants the ""hero"" sum up all the efforts and knowledge from acts one and two, to confront the ""villain"". People speak of no storyline, and especially no ""answers"" to any of the ""questions"" placed in Reloaded. What questions? Questions that we created ourselves? Why should the filmmakers answer questions they didn't place? People speak of constant battle and nothing more. Have they ever read anything? have they ever seen another movie? From Lord of the Rings, to Stephen Kings' The Stand, to Star Wars, to The Matrix, to, to, to...the third act is the same: ""People are fighting for their lives against the entire Evil Force, while the pure (or the enlightened ones) go to fight Evil on a different level, with different means"". Annoyed there was no Bullet-Time this time around, and no over the top visuals? REMEMBER! This movie was shot in the ""real"" world. Only the finale takes place in the matrix. As for the visuals...wait 'till you see the war in Zion !! If there is anything that spoiled the movie for me, it was the Oracle. Unfortunately there is no way you can stop death in the real world, but there was no chance for us, (or the actors themselves) to connect with the new actress. And the fact that the movie seemed too short. I would enjoy another hour of it. As for the Suits humans wore to fight, and the woman with the twin rocket launcher, I take it as a tip-of-the-hat to James Cameron's Aliens, which gives another plus to the movie."

I do believe that they ended the movie in the only way possible, but I just feel getting there was a bit too painful for me.  The majority of the scenes in the movie were either dragged out too much (one scene that comes to mind is a certain person's death) or were just the same as scenes from the previous two but changed a little (The club scene = The Hallway scene). Maybe if the movie was edited a bit differently and shortened by about 30 minutes, my opinion might have been different. I will not be purchasing the third movie when it comes out on DVD.  For me, the matrix series ended in the second movie.  I will force my mind to believe that Neo walked out the door to the right and went in to the source, not the left door to save Trinity. I would have been much happier if that was the case.<br/><br/>`There is no third movie' (Just in case you didn't get it, spoon spoof)"

","***MILD SPOILERS*** The third and maybe final chapter in the Matrix series.<br/><br/>After a brilliant first movie and in my opinion excellent sequel, comes a complete let down of a movie.  The problem of this final chapter is in the name 'Matrix'.  The reason we loved the first and the second was because of what happens in the Matrix, not the boring world outside.<br/><br/>
The Matrix world gave the directors the chance to really push the visuals and action.  The problem with Zion, is it's a rather dull boring place. This film was almost entirely set in this boring place.<br/><br/>More annoying was the non-existent mess of a plot.  The first film was almost perfect in adding layers and layers to the plot, which made it an usually deep action movie.  The second, which a number of people have criticised, took the story on even further explaining the real bigger story of the Matrix and Neo's involvement in it.  The third ignored all this and delivered a battle and an ending without any real depth or style.  Gone is the story from the first two.<br/><br/>Where are the explanations that we expected after Reloaded.  What are these ghost programs, what's their purpose,  what was that train driver crap. What happened to all the other ships, why the hell don't they have EMP's in Zion.  What was the point of the little girl at the end.  What was the point of the Merovingian and all that pontificating, for what.  What was the point of the kiss by Persephone in Reloaded.<br/><br/>The sad thing is I could have written a better ending than this.  How about both worlds being in the Matrix and this whole adventure was to qualify people to be able to leave the Matrix.  At least that would have been a sci-fi ending.<br/><br/>Bitterly disappointed, as the Matrix films and the Animatrix had created such a good deep story line that was ruined by the last chapter."

","This has to be the most ambiguous film I have ever seen. Whoever said it tied all loose ends must have slept through the whole movie. There were so many pointless characters (The train man?), and what's more, characters from the last film and perhaps even the first were rendered hapless and pointless parodies of themselves. I must say that after a very open and somewhat existential start to the series, I felt bombarded with Christian ethos at the end; in other words, I felt that for a series that stressed the futility of purpose and control, I was let down at the end. The worst part of this movie is by far the dialogue, which is chock full of one-liners a la Terminator movies. (I'm actually surprised we didn't get a Matrix cast for world leaders campaign ad somewhere in the middle.) The next worst part is its predictability. Though some of the action scenes were laudable their durations made them boring and tedious. After a great start, the last two movies definitely left it rather bloated and typical of all Hollywood action movies."

Under the surface of the second film, if you take your time to analyze you find a wonderful web of hints and underlying explanations of what the writers were trying to create. Now for the third movie, people were expecting a brilliant ending.

","Let me say first that I loved the first Matrix episode. The second one is not nearly as good as the first one but it got at least some memorable scenes. The third one at last is just crap. I think i never was so disappointed of a movie as I was after this one.<br/><br/>What made the first movie so good was the awesome combination of a clever storyline, revolutionary action sequences and a big fat load of style.<br/><br/>All of this points are missing now.<br/><br/>The storyline is just horrible. There are tons of questions left from the second movie (remember the architect? What he said is just ignored with a short line from the oracle...) and the characters they introduced just had no appearance here (Remember the Twins? Remember those ""upgraded"" Agents?) The movie is put together from a ultra long action sequence in the real world and the big finale fight and some death sequences (I'm pierced by 4 metal bars but I'm still able to talk 3 minutes... yeah... sure) and last and least some ""I love you, love you too"" sequences. Good news is that the conclusion DOES make sense.<br/><br/>The breathtaking action sequences just miss in this one. We have a overlong sequence of zion defending itself against a S**TLOAD of sentinels with a load of ""Aliens"" style robots. The problem is that if you didn't like the Neo vs. 300 Smiths sequence in reloaded because it looked computerish you will run out of the teathre screaming this time. Same goes for the final fight between Neo and Smith.<br/><br/>And the Style is just missing. Why? Because the movie plays mostly in the real world. Thousands of sentinels being shot down only to make place for another 5000 is nice in a 5 minute sequence but should not make all the content in a movie. If I want gunfights like that, I'd go and watch some Arnie movies. I want STYLE. Remember the dodge the bullets move?! Or the training sequence from the first one?? THIS had STYLE. A twenty minute shooting-like-mad sequence DOESNT.<br/><br/>And don't DARE to tell me that i don't like the movie because I ""didn't see behind the scenes"" and stuff like that. You can't save a bad movie with a complex story that will make all fanboys like ""if you dont like it you are stupid"".<br/><br/>Well anyways I'm sure that most of you guys will watch this movie anyways because its MATRIX (just as I did...).

Without giving anything away, the ending is not disappointing in the least; the reason why so many unthinking critics have said it is, is because they like to have some idea of the ending of a movie before it even ends, so when it's unexpected, they don't like it. 'Thinking, you say?? Not for us! Let us passively watch and expect every movie to end in the standard good-guy kicks everyone's ass way; nothing else is acceptable.'

","For those of us that went to see THE MATRIX in the theater, what we saw was a thinking-man's action-adventure film. The special effects were there to propel the plot and to emphasize the film's underlying questions on the nature of reality, the nature of humanity and the power of the mind over the body. The film was a self-contained story -- beginning, middle and end -- and it told its tale very well, with style grace and power.<br/><br/>The potential in a trilogy based upon this stellar beginning was great. Sort of like those of us that watched STAR WARS about the 10th time and suddenly there was the words ""Episode IV"" at the beginning subtly telling us that there was a lot more of this great film to come.<br/><br/>For those of us that went to see THE MATRIX: RELOADED in the theater, we saw a film that displayed for us what it would have been like if the first half of THE MATRIX had been expanded to a full-length film. This was alright, however, because we got to have our interlude -- the search for the ""McGuffin"" of the Key-Maker lead us to the Architect and gave us a list of questions dealing with the nature of the matrix that would keep us talking for months until the next film came out. it was not as good as number one, but it served its purpose. After all, the big payoff was coming in the third installment, right?<br/><br/>For those of us that went to see THE MATRIX: REVOLUTIONS in the theater, we saw a film that reminded us that, in the end, what it all boils down to is this: THE MATRIX is just another series of action-adventure flicks, nothing more. In the end, it leaves us feeling as emotionally detached as a DIRTY HARRY movie.<br/><br/>And this is sad, because the first one gave us so much hope that this trilogy could be so much more than it turned out to be. It asked dozens of deep, philosophical questions and in the third movie, ignored them, talked around them, and managed to answer none of them. The war is over. But is it? After all, the human population will grow in Zion and with the machines still up there, they are bound to but heads again... Neo is dead. But is he? After all, he dies in the first episode too, and he was still around for two sequels. Agent Smith was destroyed. But was he? After all, he, too, was destroyed in the first film, and he, too, returned for two sequels.<br/><br/>All of this leads me to believe that we were given some smoke and mirrors in the first episode. It was great smoke and mirrors, to be sure. But in the end, it was every bit as phony as the world within the Matrix, and had about as much substance."

","We are greatly blessed to be living in an era where we have two fantastic trilogies which are not only fun to watch, but work on multiple different levels of consciousness.  These two movie franchises being `Lord of the Rings' and `The Matrix.'   Unlike the hopelessly irrelevant `Star Wars' prequel trilogy, which tries so hard to be more than it is but ultimately seems rather forced; the LOTR and Matrix trilogies were designed from the ground up with an eye on the classics, theology and philosophy.  Both are far more messianic that the Star Wars prequel could ever hope to be, and both demonstrate how just ONE MAN (or one hobbit) can make all the difference in the world, quite literally.  We are still contemplating the lives and the legacies of such great men of peace like Buddha, Socrates and Jesus, all of who were just men (or perhaps a bit more than just mere `men') who had a better idea of just how life should be lived, and two of them, Socrates and Jesus, ultimately paid the highest price for their `radical' ideas.<br/><br/>Now we have the final installment of the Matrix trilogy, and it does a good job of tying up all the loose ends, plus throws in a few more twists just to keep things interesting.  Right up to the very end it is obvious that philosophy, theology and the classics are very much on the minds of the Wachowski brothers, as we watch them create a seamless garment out of three very different threads.  In the opening, we see that Neo is trapped in the world of the `Trainman,'   He's stuck at the Mobile Avenue subway station, waiting for his train to come in.  This station is a `halfway' point between the human world and the Matrix, a kind of purgatory without the flames. We soon find out that the Trainman works for the Merovingian, and they both are very determined to keep Neo `waiting' at that station for a very, very long time.<br/><br/>Thanks to a word from the Oracle (who else?) who is now in a new `shell,' Trinity and Morpheus set out to confront the Merovingian and get Neo back into the Matrix, so he can get back into his body!  From there, the story takes off, as we still have those pesky sentinels to deal with, who are getting closer and closer to their goal of the complete destruction of Zion.<br/><br/>
Much like the second movie, the third is filled with a cast of secondary characters that makes for a truly delicious movie going experience.  We have some new characters: `the Trainman;' and a nice Indian family of programs Neo meets waiting for a train at the Mobile Avenue station. There is an expanded role for Seraph, the guardian of the Oracle.  All of our favorites are back as well, the Oracle (in a new `shell'), Smith, Naobi, the Merovingian, Cornel West and so on.  Never have I seen a film so filled with so many interesting and memorable secondary characters.  Each so very unique and yet very likable --even Smith himself in his own quirky way.<br/><br/>It's in this movie, as is obvious from the trailers, that we have the ultimate showdown between Neo and Smith.  But now we see each fully for what they are, and what their destiny is.  Smith is the incarnation of post-modernism, the quintessential nihilist, who sees no meaning or purpose in anything.  His only goal: to make everything over into his image--literally, and impose his idea of Utopia upon the entire Matrix, and the rest of the world as well.  It's this type of philosophy that gives us Nazi Germany and Maoist China: sameness is good, diversity bad.  Then we have Neo, the Zen Master Messiah, who refuses to jump into the tar pit of post-modern philosophical thought, but would much rather prefer to transcend it.  He is the incarnation of faith, hope and love; `the virtue trinity'; embodied in one person.  One of these belief systems, Neo or Smith, has a viable, dynamic future, and one leads down the path to entropy and Big Brother.<br/><br/>This film has a wonderful time mixing and matching pantheism, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and various philosophical viewpoints and ideas.  The characters of this movie are embodiments of these different worldviews, and one appreciates this trilogy so much more with the preunderstaning of these things in mind.  Do you need a thorough background in philosophy, theology and the classics to fully appreciate this film?  Yes, absolutely.  If you don't, it will seem like so much intellectual nonsense with some good fight scenes and lots of automatic weaponry.<br/><br/>It is obvious to me that the Wachowski Brothers appreciate and pay homage to Frank Herbert's excellent books `Dune' and `Dune Messiah' in Revolutions. IMHO, these two books are the best that science fiction has ever produced, and it seems as if the Wachowski brothers agree, as some of the major themes and plot ideas seem to have come these sources.  No, it's not a repeat of `Dune' in a mechanical, apocalyptic setting, but we do see some tremendous similarity in themes and ideas between the two.  Of course `Dune' is not the sole source of inspiration here, and in looking for dominating themes and ideas, one would have to come to the conclusion that comic books, anime, Christianity and Buddhism are major contributing factors, probably in that order.<br/><br/>No movie is perfect, and `Matrix Revolution' has a few areas that could have been done better.  Yet, it is still so far beyond anything else out there that it's sins can easily be forgiven.  The LOTR is a close second, but in terms of overall production, the Matrix is far more interesting and imaginative.  One only has to compare the fight scenes between the two trilogies to see it.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions: 8/10 The Matrix Reloaded: 10/10 The Matrix: 10/10"
"dr_asrana","9","0","0","7 November 2003"," Matrix trilogy explained-read it and you will love revolutions
","Let me first say I PROMISE YOU WILL LOVE THIS TRILOGY IF U READ THIS.<br/><br/>I apologize if my post does not follow the rules of this forum, but I felt I could offer you a very clear explanation of the Matrix series in light of reading your reviews of the Matrix Revolutions. The bottom line is people don't understand it. So this is a crash course for anyone who wants answers. Real one's, not some fanboys idea of what it's about. Please note, SPOILERS ARE ALL THROUGH THIS REVIEW.<br/><br/>Here we go with the basics.<br/><br/>Zion is real! The Matrix is not.<br/><br/>The Matrix was designed to provide a mental stimulus for the human bodies connected to the machines as a source of power. This is the sixth version of the Matrix. There have been multiple versions of the Matrix because of a flaw in the program (kinda of like Windows). That flaw is giving individuals the ability to choose.<br/><br/>The first Matrix was designed as a perfect uptopia (see pt. I - Smith explains it to Morpheus; pt. II - The Architect explains it again) but humans did not accept it as real so they just kept waking up. It was redesigned to reflect our civilization at it's last stage before it was taken over by the machines (the year 1999).<br/><br/>The Architect's problem with this new design (the anomoly)of the Matrix is that it require individuals to think freely, i.e. choice. It was the Oracle that suggested he redesign the Matrix in this way. But since humans have choices, so must the programs sent to watch over them, i.e. The Agents, thus bringing us the problem that is Mr. Smith. In Reloaded, The Architect continues to speak of the anomoly he is unable to get rid of, which is why at some point, he feels the only solution is to destroy the Matrix and those who are aware of it (the people of Zion) and start from scratch again.<br/><br/>
The Oracle says it clearly in Revolutions. Mr. Smith is the result of the anomoly trying to balance itself. Mr. Smith began to think freely (see part I where he is freaking out while interrogating Morpheous) and the result was a negative one. Realize this, he is a similar program to the One so he is far more dangerous than a normal individual who makes bad decisions. Mr. Smith's virus like behavior happened in EVERY VERSION OF THE MATRIX. The result would always lead to the same thing -- a system crash if they didn't quickly reboot the system. The same knee jerk reaction you have when you realize someone has sent you a virus.<br/><br/>The One program was created to solve this problem. But each version of the One ultimately failed. Neo is different, in Reloaded he choose the door that led to Trinity, not the door that RESETS the program. Note: The Architect even noticed that Neo's experience in the Matrix was different than all the rest, realizing he was the first of them to fall in love.<br/><br/>Onto Revolutions:<br/><br/>Neo's choice has changed everything. The system is still threatened by Smith's behavior, so the Oracle makes a new choice; one she has never done before because no version of the One has ever chosen the difficult path as opposed to easy one of just resetting the system. She allows herself to become merged with Smith in the HOPE that she'll be able to help Neo when the time is right.<br/><br/>Neo makes another unique choice. He goes to the machines and asks for PEACE as opposed to simply destroying the system by going through the opposite door as all other versions of the One did. It was a simple as that to save Zion. Machines don't need very long to process that this may be a better idea than just constantly resetting the system.<br/><br/>At the end, Smith says to Neo the movies tagline - ""Everything that has a beginning has an end,"" as the Oracle is speaking to Neo through Smith. Neo realizes it all along, the only way to end this is to sacrifice himself. The Oracle noted that Neo and the Source (the computer mainframe, the Architect they're all one and the same so don't get confused) are connected which is why he can control machines outside the Matrix. He uses this connection to his advantage. He becomes a Mr. Smith and since all the Smith's are connected, the Source now has a lock on Smith and simply deletes him. Pretty simple huh?<br/><br/>For those that like to dig deeper, than note the biblical references throughout the series. Heck, the French Man (Merovigchian) is the Devil, just read the elevator button Morpheous presses when he goes to see him for the second time. The Architect represents God - i.e. the creator of the world and its destroyer whenever things don't go as he wants. He even has you to chose a select group of people to restart Zion again sort of like Noah's Ark. Neo is Jesus, the one who realizes that peace and love is the answer, not war. And the Oracle represents the Holy Spirit - the consciousness that resides in all of us. It's a deep trilogy if you PAY ATTENTION."

","Part of this could be seen as a spoiler - read on with that understanding.<br/><br/>To begin, I enjoyed this one more than Matrix Reloaded but not nearly as much as Matrix itself. It was visually better than Reloaded - the CGI is so much cleaner, but visuals alone aren't enough. Both of the follow-up Matrix movies suffered from sudden halts in the action. Those halts (wanna bat philosophy around?) lets the audience catch up with the action to that point, then they have to sit there and twiddle their metaphorical thumbs until the action takes off again. ""Willing suspension of disbelief"" is very hard to maintain in that atmosphere.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this one is that the premise, minds trapped in a digital world, could have had so many more ways of being resolved, or not resolved as the case may be. ""The One"" turns out to be The One (micro-evolutionary freak) that can see the ""Matrix of Reality"", if you want to call it that. What is this, X-Men of the Matrix? No competent sci-fi writer today would use that tired plot twist to wind down such a promising storyline.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed after the movie dropped to credits. Where's the closure? There are so many loose ends that another sequel only makes sense. But how many times can they do such a weak job and expect people to keep coming back? Storyline is what made the original Matrix so great, but it is the poorest part of these sequels."

","Saw revolutions last night in a packed Theatre and I'm finding it a bit difficult to sum up my feelings on the film, having now seen the entire trilogy....<br/><br/>Firstly, I loved the orginal Matrix. When it first came out I was blown away by the universe created by the Wachowskis in a way that could only compare to the first time I saw Star Wars. It's fair to say that it was highly derivative and stole ideas left right and centre from other fantasy franchises, but it presented everything in such an original and stylish way and really left you caring about the fate of the characters.<br/><br/>Then came reloaded........ In equal measure I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a movie. It seemed to be a charicature of the first film and the emotion and depth of the characters from the original got buried in a endless flow of philosophy and mysticism that ultimately for me sent the film up it's own arse. Burly brawl and car chase aside, I hated it and the scene with the Architect has to rank as one of my least favourite of all time, I wanted to stand up in the cinema and shout 'what the f are you talking about'...... I see I am not alone in this too.<br/><br/>So, revolutions. I guess it falls somewhere between the first and second. After a terrible start, featuring an incredibly patronising Indian character who seems to be cloned from Apu on the simpsons and a pointless Neo gets stuck in a train station section, the film really started to get into gear when the heros made their way back to Zion over the backdrop of the seige by the machines. I have to say that the battle for Zion has to be one of the most stunning wars ever committed to film, the CGI is simply on another level to anything I've ever seen before and it carries on for so long I was left feeling exhausted when the conflict finally drew to a close. I loved the APU machines and Nathanial Lees as Mifuni was, for me, the most heroic character in the entire trilogy. I loved his performance and was moved when he met his inevitable death. The bit where the robots punched their fists in the air was corny as hell though......<br/><br/>So then we come to the final part of the film, Agent Smith goes into Ham overdrive and made me wince with his 'evil laugh' when he took over the Oracle. I won't give away the ending, but suffice to say it was set up in such a way that a sequel cannot be that far off. That's ok though, if it means the Wachowskis can make a film as good at the first then that's fine by me. Reloaded and Revolutions were ultimately disappointing but there is so little science fiction made with as much ambition as this it would be wrong to say they were failures."

Oh don't get me wrong, terrific special effects, some good acting (in the face of a terrible script).

","'Everything that has a beginning has an end' state the posters. `Woah' we think, imitating the Messianic Neo, `that's, like, so simple-yet-deep. It just has to have, like, a deeper meaning. And, like, a Revolution is, like, a circle, which, like, means that maybe it doesn't have an end after all. Man, those Wakoffemalsky dudes are clever.'<br/><br/>Don't bet on it. Six months after Colonel Sanders wannabe The Architect sent us spilling out into the night discussing inevitable systemic anomalies, cataclysmic systems crashes and how the One should technically be named the Sixth, we finally get to find out which of all the wonderful possibilities the end of Matrix Reloaded prompted are true and which were, frankly, the products of underused and slightly sad imaginations. Of so you would think. Instead, the Wachowski's have inexplicably chosen to ignore just about every idea put forward at the end of Part 2, taken us mostly outside of the action playground of the physics-defying Matrix, away from the theme of fate vs. destiny that was the cornerstone of the series, and dished us up a conventional sci-fi/action film centering on humanity's last stand against the maurauding machines. The writing/directing brothers seem to have lost their nerve in this concluding installment, choosing to serve up an hour and a half of bullet-spewing, race against time, pedal to metal - but distinctly un-Matrix like - action in the hope that, with all the shooting and shouting and special effects, that the audience won't notice that Revolutions barely addresses any of the issues that helped the first two films tickle the intellect and the imagination as well as the eye.<br/><br/>What Matrix-based scenes there are are undeniably stunning. There's the opening shoot-out in the lobby of the S&M club run by mysterious French slimeball the Merovingian (whose role in the big scheme of things - like so much else in the film - turns out to be the most mundane of all the possibilities). And the final slug-fest between Neo and Smith inside the coming-apart-at-the-seams Matrix is a stunning tour de force set piece that defies just about every action convention in the book and writes some new ones of its own. What a pity then, that the Matrix is visited so rarely, and the viscerally impressive - but hardly distinctive - battle for Zion so resolutely placed centre stage. The reality-defying kung-fu of the series' fantasy world is, after all, the reason why this has all become so cool.<br/><br/>The Wachowski's are undoubtedly blessed with brilliant imaginations and the ambitions to match, and as in its predecessor, there are a fistful of moments in Revolutions that take the breath away. However, now that their modus operandi is now complete, their principle shortcoming is laid bare; with so many characters, ideas, and themes introduced over the first two films, they have proved unable to bring focus and coherence to the seemingly hundreds of things they wanted to do in these three films. Questions, character arcs, and plot strands crucial to the saga are skipped over with a few inconclusive lines of dialogue, all supposedly justified by that catch-all of get-out clauses: that the viewer should make up his own mind. Balls. The ending to Revolutions could hardly have been less satisfactory had Keanu woken up at his computer terminal and pronounced the whole thing a dream. The interminably bitty and superficial ending will have its supporters of course, but in their heart of hearts they must know that's its nothing more than an example of lazy scriptwriting. After two films and around seven hours of new characters and new ideas, the Wachowski's have ultimately fallen victim to their own hyperactive imaginations, and imploded.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: there is much to admire in Matrix Revolutions. The action is plentiful and brilliantly handled. It is far more in keeping with the sombre tone and the grubby, muted look of the original than the too-sterile middle instalment, and the Wachowski's have rediscovered the emotional touch that went AWOL in Reloaded, including taking the Neo/Trinity love affair to its natural conclusion and rediscovering what made Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, the best performance in the film by a country mile) such a great villain. For these reasons it is in some respects more satisfying. But then, Reloaded was not the film that we were promised would tie everything up. Reloaded didn't have the weight of the entire saga resting on its shoulders. Whatever Reloaded's shortcomings, we could always remain hopeful - that optimism fuelled by producer Joel Silver and the Warner Bros publicity department, consistently declaring the brothers `geniuses' - that the Wachowski's could pull it off, tie up all those loose plot strands and tie them into the arcs of their characters, bringing the saga to a close in a dramatically satisfying way. After all, no one in their right mind(s) would put so much material in these films if they didn't have a plan of sorting it all out in the end, right? Revolutions doesn't even come close, and this is why it must be branded a disappointment. The fans didn't spend the six months since Reloaded endlessly debating how good the SFX were. What really stimulated people - and what was so enticing about the series - was the fun derived from wondering how those enslaved to the Matrix would be released, whether Zion really was a Matrix-within-a-Matrix, and sundry other items that genuinely sparked the imagination. Addressing these things - and introducing them in the first place with a sense of discipline - could have resulted in the great cinematic saga of our time. Instead, what history will remember is a truly great original followed by two sequels that had more questions than it had answers. Like the prophecy Morpheus so resolutely believed in, our blind faith in the Wachowski's also turned out to be misplaced: the answers to all those questions are not coming and, tragically, now they never will."

"paul_d","10","0","0","7 November 2003"," The Perfect Trilogy
","Firstly I must say that it seems a lot of reviews on here judge Matrix Revolutions as a single movie and not part of a trilogy. Revolutions provide all the answers presented in the first and second Matrix and do this in spectacular style. I must add that to get a full understanding of the Matrix Trilogy viewing the Animatrix, The Matrix Game, discussing the all characters and there actions and is a must before you view Revolutions. I walking into Revolutions full of questions; what was the Oracles true purpose? Was Neo choice of doors expected by the Architect? How could Neo stop the Sentinels in the real world? How did Agent Smith exit the Matrix, plus many more and I'm glad to say all were answered.<br/><br/>******** Spoilers Below ***********<br/><br/>After viewing Revolutions I was very impressed with the solution the Wa Brothers created. It was easy to see that the Oracle who could ""see"" everything orchestrated the entire sequence of events to for a while bring peace to not only the Matrix but the real world, it was obvious the Machine could have wiped out Zion if they wanted but you see Machines do not have emotions they simply want to survive, if they are not threatened they have no need to destroy the humans, in the Animatrix it is explained that Human emotion, fear of the unknown and prejudice is what led to the exile of the machines and the eventual war between the Humans and the Machines.<br/><br/>In regards to people's objections to Trinity's death, again this was very important because all throughout Neo's existence he only cared for himself, he didn't want Trinity to die because he would miss her. After his death his actions were purely for humanity and by giving himself to the Machines and Agent Smith really did become the savior of the Human race hence solidifying all the religious connections seen through out the Trilogy. To sum up, the perfect ending to an incredible story and a true Trilogy,<br/><br/>

","These are really three of the greatest movies ever made. Neither third or second part are as good as the first one but together they are invincible.<br/><br/>There was never a thrilogy made with such a connection between the movies. The first, the greatest and the most mystique one, is only one that can be a round for itself but it leaves many questions open. Second, the deepest in philosophy, answers some of them and makes a new ones. The third, that bring back the old action, answers them all but for a lot of people in a different way.<br/><br/>And even thougt the third part is the action movie more than anything else it is the most hard part to understand - because it is the conclusion. You cannot find another action movie with such a complexity. As my friend said: ""I think they made this movie wanting you to seek for answers on your own, but how can I seek for answer when I don't know the question?"". All three movies demand to be watched a few times just to understand them and a plenty of action gives us an opportunity not to be bored when watching them again. You can be somewhat disappointed after watching the second and third part but only afterwards you see their true value.<br/><br/>You can say this or that about ""The Matrix"" thrilogy  but this is the movie that gives us two things. It is the first one that describes the inevitable connection between the humans and machines using that what brought machines to life - computer programming. Second, it tries to explain and gives a reasonable explanation for every aspect of our unique lives. Tell me another movie with that value, if you can."

","The Matrix Revolutions basically takes all the parts I didn't like about Reloaded (i.e. the Zion scenes) and expands them to fill most of the movie.

","Matrix Revolutions has truly made me sad. I appreciate all the aforementioned references to both Christian and other mythologies, but this was supposed to be (at least in my humble opinion) an exciting sci-fi action trilogy. <br/><br/>With ""The Matrix"" it started brilliantly, moving the borders of imagination, taking the special effects to a whole new level and destroying action films for the next 10 (probably) years. It was truly a work of remarkable vision which could, but didn't have to be furtherly exploited.<br/><br/>One way or another, ""Matrix Reloaded"" came. Even though it was clearly obvious the vision was significantly weakened, it still provided even more breathtaking effects, with a little flaky but still promising plot and putting an enormous expectation on the conclusive part III.<br/><br/>And then there was ""Matrix Revolutions"". It started slowly, making me think all the dark previews were correct. Then it finally got rolling, leading into the battle for Zion which was not only breathtaking, but I believe was only surpassed by ""The Two Towers"" as the best battle scene ever filmed. And I truly started believing ""This will be a magnificent movie"". And when we got to the final confrontation between Neo and Smith, I still had very high hopes and I still believed. The fight is great (of course, nowhere near the ""Burly Brawl"", but still...), but at one point it got too long and I began to think ""This isn't good"".<br/><br/>And then...<br/><br/>Well, no point in spoiling the ending for anybody, but I must say that that was by far the most unsatisfying ending of any movie I have ever seen and one of the biggest disappointments in my life altogether. To be honest, I did try to imagine what kind of ending could meet the enormous expectations the trilogy has put upon itself, and I came up with nothing. Nothing they could have possibly imagined would be good enough.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that doesn't lessen my disappointment. I loved part I, liked part II very much and cannot mourn part III enough."
"jaywolfenstien","Null","0","0","10 November 2003"," Film and a half?
","So where's the plot of Reloaded?  The first thirty minutes of Revolutions. I've noticed an interesting phenomena with Wachowski films.  I really don't care to sit through the beginning of their films again, the over-explanation of basic philosophy inspires me to not care what's being said and not bother to use my imagination and intellect to decipher their more abstract agenda. Does the film make sense on as deep a level as obsessive fans claim? Frankly, I don't care either way.<br/><br/>Once Revolutions wisely cuts its ties with the two-hours of trilogy filler material that was Reloaded, then I really started to get into this final act of the trilogy.  Other improvements over Reloaded?  Far less bullet-time (thank God); no more cop-out endings to battles; I wasn't watching a bunch of choreographed dance moves or, better phrased, the battles have intensity to them again; fights have enough plot/character purpose to justify them existing (though the length is still a bit too long, not as noticeable as Reloaded).<br/><br/>The battle between Neo and Smith, battle for Zion, and the war between human and machines, for the most part had satisfying endings.  My only real complaints for how the Wachowskis ended the trilogy comes down to very fine nit-picky details.  I found it particularly annoying how quickly, optimistically, and unrealistically the characters embraced the resolutions; however, I do acknowledge that to be true to life and history as we know it that would require significant more screen time that the Matrix trilogy does not have room for.  I just feel that it could've been handled a little more realistically in the film.<br/><br/>Also the final dialogue in the film I didn't care too much for.  It seemed too much like the universal epic-movie ending we've all come to expect.  And after the final battles, both inside and outside the Matrix, I felt the Wachowskis were above that.  Oh well, overall I was satisfied with how the Wachowski brothers ended this series.  I'm glad they didn't sit us down for another 30 minutes and over-explain all the little nit-picky questions the audience is sure to have.  Mystery is good.  Explaining everything is bad.<br/><br/>Side note: kind of a pet peeve regarding trilogies (not exclusive to Matrix). . . typically, the first film is a stand-alone pilot for the rest of the series; if it does well, the second film is deliberately `to be continued' with a cliffhanger for the third film.  So in other words you really get one film and a second film in two parts.  That bothers me for some reason, and it doesn't really feel like a true trilogy to me.  Oh well."
"degeneration","4","0","0","7 November 2003"," Another disappointment
","Well I saw it today, and thought it was alright, but nothing special at all. Gave it 4/10.<br/><br/>The only reason it got 4 is cause I still really like the story. Everything else either was crap or used far too much of a good thing.<br/><br/>I don't mind CG effects at all. When used right they can make a good film/scene a brilliant film/scene. For me, they should be used to enhance a film/scene, not replace it. And like the new Star Wars films, this is where Revolutions (and Reloaded) falls down. People will probably argue that a lot of what they were trying to show would not have been possible without CG. Well yes, that may be true, but that is where creativity comes into play, something I feel is somewhat lacking these days. The original Star Wars trilogy managed fine all those years ago...<br/><br/>
SPOILER WARNING! THERE ARE PROBABLY SPOILERS IN THE TEXT AHEAD!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Anyway, absolutely none of the action set pieces in Rev got me going at all. It all just came across as run of the mill stuff. The big attack on Zion... too much fancy CG to give it any great impact or emotion. The final fight had a bit of power to it, but because of all the ""It's my world here"" style comments from Smith, it lost its power. Too much of a good thing is a bad thing.<br/><br/>Throughout the trilogy we have been told that Neo was the saviour or the people... I got that point. He sacrificed himself to save them all, yes I saw that. But was the Jesus cross pose for him on the ground towards the end really necessary?!<br/><br/>After the battle with Smith was won, the film went into Cheese overload. The rave section was by far the worst section of Reloaded, and from when the Smith fight was won onwards is by far the worst section of Revolutions.<br/><br/>
Colin Chou was completely wasted in both films. He only had one fight with Neo in Reloaded, where he obviously wouldn't be allowed to win as he couldn't beat Neo... the only properly trained martial artist in the film, and they give him two guns in this one...<br/><br/>
END OF SPOILERS!<br/><br/>
I could probably moan for a while about the film, longer than my 4/10 rating would suggest. So why did i give it that score? Well it was still entertaining. Despite giving nothing new in the action dept. and basically being run of the mill stuff throughout, it was still entertaining, and I do like the story. From what I've read and heard other people saying, I can honestly state that I do believe there are many parts to the story that I don't understand and probably don't even really know about. But the way I have the story in my head, and what I think I understand, I like. It makes me think, and there are still some open ends to allow my imagination to wander. So for me that is where the film does score well. It is just a shame the story wasn't really handled that well IMO.<br/><br/>
Part 1 had everything working well together in good balance. Great action, great style, and great story. Part 2 had action and style which was no longer fresh and seriously underwhelmed. The good elements from part 1 were discarded. But for me it had a story which was thought provoking and complex enough to make part 3 a must see. Part 3 was pretty much the same, the story was its only realy plus point. Nothing else had a wow factor to carry the film.<br/><br/>
So for me The Matrix is one film, the first one. Parts 2 and 3 will be completely ignored as they just drag down an brilliant film.<br/><br/>
How could I forget to mention this - one of the other main (although brief) best parts of Revolutions. The meeting Morpheus, Trinity and Seriph have with the Meriv... Mervi.. Morvign... the french dude, who else even bothered to look at him when they had Monica Bellucci's fantastic looking cleavage to stare at? And to think that little scene alone got her mentioned in the main credits at the end! Other people have had bigger roles in films and just been mentioned in somewhere far down the credits as ""girl with hotdog"" etc. Although from that I am not implying that  Perisiphone have a hot dog at any point in the film, it was just an example!"

","After the first Matrix we got rid of all non-scifi people, the second one we lost the non-philosophy crowd and now only the die-hards survived. What wrong with you people? The comments look familiar, the first one was the best or there aren't any cool new actors introduced. These are the same people that write that Pearl Jam's first album Ten was the best ever..or that Command & Conquer's Red Alert didn't have enough new figures to play with. Pearl Jam still kicks ass and C&C was excellent playing. Who cares that you no longer have questions to ask whether Morpheus is pregnant or Mr Smith will play in the Blues Brothers 2003? The story is finished, the showdown was great and the fighting in the Dome unsurpassed. I think this historic battle will be re-enacted for years to come by the same people that use tin soldiers to analyze Waterloo (Wouldn't it be better if the stream of Sentinels flanked instead of a full frontal?).<br/><br/>All movies have something to nitpick (for me it's the fact that there are too many romantic scenes in this one.. probably caused by the Sentimentals: those flying machines who can apparently carry a lot of violins), but let's not forget that this was an awesome movie. The W's only had to make 4 movies to be in the same league as Starwars or LOTR.that's quite an achievement. 8 out of 10 for this one!<br/><br/>BTW the most hysterical thing was in the trailer preceding the Matrix: It claims that Tom Cruise is the last samurai."

"thsieh_83","Null","0","0","7 November 2003"," Ignore The Critics: Revolutions Is a Masterpiece
","First off: do ignore all the vain, petty narrow-mindedness of the critics, those many idiots who think they know how to judge what constitutes a true work of art. With all the inanity and foolishness aside, Matrix Revolutions is a masterpiece, pure and simple. It is a brilliant tour-de-force, a masterfully crafted ending to a masterfully crafted modern-epic. In many ways, I believe it to be the perfect finish to the entire series, an ultimate apotheosis and summation that brings justice and completion to the entire trilogy as a whole. From the very beginning, there are a variety of interesting narrative tricks the Wachowskis have in store for us. Neo is trapped in a limbo between the real-world and the machine-world: metaphorically a train-station, ruled by a train master, which is brilliantly done. We are introduced to an Indian family with a 'human' child, who are programs that elicit various interesting philosophical reflections. Not to get into the intricacies of the story too much, but it's good, believe me, and the cinematography, imagery, and direction are consistently inspired. The picture-quality is rendered crisp and clear, and everything has a very sharp feel and style.<br/><br/>The action is also excellently done: from the Hell-Club shoot-out that involves gravity reversing ceiling walkers, to a breath-taking, all-out battle between the humans of Zion (APU Units) and masses of swarming sentinels, there is an impression left, an original stamping of the Wachowski's style (an aesthetic that has inspired - and still will - countless film-makers and artists). Although the majority of the movie takes place in the gritty, dismal darkness of the real world - constituting many furious chases on ships - there are some nice scenes that take place in The Matrix, especially the climatic battle between Neo and Agent Smith. This truly was perhaps the best part of the film: an epic, superhuman fight between the two characters, who, endowed with supreme powers, fight like gods admist a plethora of brilliant special effects (The fights almost remind one of Anime battles, say in the style of Akira Toriyama).<br/><br/>Although some of the acting and dialogue could have been improved, I found the lines to be better than that of Reloaded. Also, although the performance Keanu Reeves puts out might receive the anethma of film critics, he does a fairly solid and nice job (The drama, and play on themes of love were better then I thought they'd be). And what's more, the genius of the story perhaps overwhelms any of these minor histrionic faults. There are echoes everywhere in the film to the first one, and the spiritual, metaphysical and philosophical symbolism (especially the ending) are brilliantly pulled off by the Wachowskis. I am not a Christian myself, but I was particularly impressed by the way in which the Wachowskis used the religious mythology in their tale, how they shaped the story into a modern-myth, commenting on many profound levels.<br/><br/>In summary, Revolutions does an excellent job of concluding the entire trilogy, and brings the entire Matrix story to an interesting close. It is definitely recommended, and even if you don't think you'll agree that it's an absolute masterpiece, you'll at least have paid for an excellent action-movie with many powerful scenes. The Wachowskis have truly demonstrated their artistic prowess by creating this completely original epic-trilogy, a defining landmark for cinema if you will, and I look forward to their future work which will undoubtedly have this distinct and independent vision."

Trinity and Neo prove there are no boundaries where love is involved, morpheus shows he is not the solid rock everyone (including himself) believes him to be whilst Niobi proves that women are excellent drivers too (watch it) and the people of xion prove that even when you believe there is no point to carry on and to just give up, being blown to pieces whilst fighting is better than waiting to be blown to pieces doing nothing. The rigs and effects that are used in this film are amazing the stunts breathtaking and the guns oh the guns. More than before! The unlikely alliance of the machines and neo proved to be an ironic twist that to be honest left me wishing they'd turn on them all and killed them anyway. But i enjoyed it none the less. As i read in an interview not long ago ""reloaded was about life, revolutions is about death.""<br/><br/>Some key characters do not survive revolutions and i was sad to see it happen but i feel i should say carrie anne moss and keanu reeves both deserve an immense amount of praise, this film was definately a nine.

","I think the matrix movies have gotten better and better, they have delievered on making a movie with some of the best special effects.  I also like the plot line to it. Just because a movie is an action flick doesn't mean that it can't have a deep plot.  I think if you didn't like the second two movies in the triology, then your too stupid to understand what they are trying to do.  It is almost like a Hyped up biography of Crist.  The parelles of neo and christ are great.  There are so many similarites.  I think it is great to see a great action flick with a plot.  The matrix Triology will go down as one of the best ever."

","I am honestly finding it hard to believe that people can hate this film so much!  (And in future reviews, please explain WHY it is a bad film, we ain't just gonna take your word for it!)<br/><br/>Having been slightly too young to remember my Star Wars cinema experiences, The Matrix has become, at least for me personally, the definitive film franchise thus far in my life!<br/><br/>I have a great fear that people tend to remember the original Matrix film far better than it actually is.  Sure it was a breath of fresh air in terms of action and special effects.  But it was still a flawed film (what film isn't?)  But we love it despite its imperfections.  And naturally, this leads to disappointment in Reloaded.<br/><br/>But after repeated viewings, I finally saw the magic of Reloaded. The Matrix was a complete story... the story of The One.<br/><br/>Where else could they have gone with the story?  Would you rather the Wachowski's take the usual sell-out path and remake the first film with a '2' at the end of the title?<br/><br/>No way man... the Wachowski's were in full control of the story they wanted to tell!  If you are unable to follow it, then thats your own problem.  If they took story in a different direction than you expected, guess what... thats your own damn problem too! I actually find the Wachowski's a little TOO audience-friendly... with almost every line of dialogue dripping with detail, of course some lines will sound camp, and also requires the audience to pay full attention... but how many films give us that sort of challenge these days?  And I do not believe that their classicly simple storytelling style should be held against them.  There is so much symbology (one for the Boondock fans) in their filmmaking... The Matrix trilogy was not made to be an action blockbuster.<br/><br/>I find that most of my questions after Reloaded were answered with the concluding episode of the trilogy!  And, inflating my own ego, many of my predictions were accurate too! I find Revolutions to be an amazing piece of work.  I was a tad dubious about the low-key release, but now I am thankful that nothing was revealed or spoiled because of hype and marketing! This film ROCKS!  That is all I can say!<br/><br/>The three films have merged in my mind now.  It is a story of Man Vs Machine, and the story simply does not end with the first Matrix.<br/><br/>
Dammit... lost my steam, so I will just sum it up: Go and see The Matrix Revolutions with the mindset that this is the last two hours of a six hour movie.  And make sure you understand Reloaded well if you have any hope of understanding Revolutions. If all you care about is action, then go watch T3."

","This is the first time I left the theater truly disappointed.  The power and depth of the original Matrix was an experience I had hoped to enjoy at least a small measure of in Revolutions.  Instead I get a cheezy symbolic film which strays from what those of us who saw the original movie and ""Got it"" on the first movie expected.  Too much time on special effects and shallow subplots, too little time with the main characters (Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus).  I think they used this film to cash in on the monster popularity of the Matrix.  Too bad they forgot why they made the original.  As you can tell, I did not care for this film.

","After we were about 2/3 of the way into this movie, my wife and I were thinking that the critics had watched a different movie.  Then the ending came and I realized what everyone (who did not like this movie) was referencing.  There are so many un-answered questions!<br/><br/>  The first is...<br/><br/>Can this really be the ending of the series, or are the brothers Wachowski going to surprise us with a part four?  If so then than I can recall all of this review and wait for the ""Real"" ending.  If not, then the questions remain...(all indications point to this being the last one).<br/><br/>WARNING ""MAJOR SPOILERS""...<br/><br/>  Second question...<br/><br/>The first major plot hole.  If no one has ever made it into machine city (where all human plugged into the Matrix are kept) then how the hell did they get Neo out (and into the Nebuchadnezzar) in the first movie?  And for that matter how did they get the others (Morpheus, et al) out before him?<br/><br/>  Third question...<br/><br/>Making peace with the Matrix does not achieve the main goal of freedom for humans (which Morpheus spells out in the first movie).  All Neo achieves is that he stopped Agent Smith.  Humans are still ""trapped"" in the Matrix! What happened to Neo?  <br/><br/>  Fourth question...<br/><br/>In the first movie, Trinity says the only defense against the Sentinels is the EMP.  She must have known about the Guns in Zion, right?  What about those on the ships?  Why didn't they have an EMP installed in the Dock at Zion?  <br/><br/>  Fifth question...<br/><br/>Morpheus talked about the Agents being programs, which have to obey laws and have limitations.  ""...yet their strength and their speed are still based in a world that is built on rules.  Because of that, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.""  How then does Agent Smith become such a nemesis for Neo?<br/><br/>I really like this movie up to ending, and then everything we learned from the first and second movies begins to mean nothing.  Everything humans are fighting for is undermined by the ending.  What a sad way for a great trilogy to end!"

","Have to say, that Matrix Revolutions or the entire trilogy is one of the few us blockbusters worth wasting one's time to comment on. I have seen the first one on and off several times and also Reloaded more than once, and must say that each time something new popped out(philosophy, action or even acting and wardrobe...). Perhaps the best lines were spent in the first movie (there might not have been another one), especially Agent Smith's (Hugo Weaving should have gotten a supporting oscar for the first Matrix - shame). I've seen Revolution yesterday and first have to say AWESOME!!! There were some obvious flaws in the movie, some of them certainly avoidable, but all in all it was a fitting end to a story that in time will be viewed as a hole as it should be. Some argue about who should have lived or died but ultimately all the great stories are about sacrifice for love, ideals (religion) and the greater good of many rather than oneself. Without spoiling the ending it was a little disapponting that in the end there was room left for the franchise to continue (cartoons, comics, books etc...), but that's Hollywood for ya. As for rating Revolutions would get 8/10 and the entire trilogy 10/10, for it's one of the few creations that have stirred my emotions, shaped my mind and left me wanting for more (ranks up there with music of Pink Floyd or U2, books by Heinlein and Scott Card, movies by Fincher and Ridley Scott...). GO SEE THE MOVIE!!! It's worth your time and money (my humble opinion)."

","I must say that I really expected more from these directors after seeing The Matrix. How this thing devolved into a sappy, formulaic series of smarmy stupidity is anyone's guess. My theory is that the Wachowski brothers are victims of their own success and too much money. Story, dialogue, and character aren't all that expensive to produce, but as it is, they would have been better off if they had paid a monkey to sit at a keyboard and type the script. I was sure the storytellers had learned their lessons with ""Reloaded."" Alas, no - and I'm reduced to trying to erase these two sequels from my memory so that I might enjoy the first one again. And I'm curious - was I the only viewer wondering where all the people in the Matrix were while the battles were raging and the weather was going to hell.

","The movie of end all movies has arrived and I can say it was quite impressive. Matrix Revolutions ties up confusing points and gives you a flashlight in those dark alleys from Matrix 1 and 2. But at the sametime those batteries seem to die at the end of the movie making you wonder where to and what next. I won't talk in depth about the movie for potential storyline spoiling. But I will simply sum the movie up..like this...I thought the cliff hanger for Reloaded was a total tease only to have Revolutions top that. I say this because for many people I have heard that satisfaction was not truly granted. But that seems to be in the eyes of the beholder. Revolutions by far is the best of 3 movies I give it a 10/10 for overall scoring. In some minor areas I would score a 8/10 in plot development but I would have to say that would be if I was a  HARDCORE Matrix buff. Most of the people that I know that did not like this movie was because they ate,slept and breathed Matrix and it's concepts, much more than a movie should be done in my personal opinion.The battle for Zion is simple amazing and very very intense. All I can say is in comparison to ""grand battles"" George Lucas had his crown blantantly taken by the Wachowski Bros and he cried like a little baby after Zion vs The Machines. The end battle is a grand and I do mean over the top grand battle between Smith and Neo. See this movie atleast twice I would say after you've caught up on 1 and 2 and maybe if you can play the game Enter The Matrix to fill in some of the plot holes, while not neccessary it really will add to the movie for your own benefit. See this movie with an open mind and for the fact it's entertainment. You won't be displeased in the least."

","First, I made a point not to have unrealistic expectations - like wanting to ""figure it all out"". Revolutions explained some things, left others open. The open-to-interpretation dialog was clever and _very_ open to interpretation. For me, that was satisfying, because I still want to ponder the wheels within wheels, as well as the wheels coming off. That makes it fun to talk about the movie with friends, and to enjoy watching it again. (IMAX here I come!)<br/><br/>Second, the action was just all out awesome - except, for the last fight scene. That didn't do it for me, but after the entire movie of non-stop bop, how could they possibly bang even harder? I don't care. I don't know how many times I had to retreat from the edge of my seat for a second, say ""Whoa"", and then lean forward back to attention. The tension kept taut, with simultaneous action strands - it felt like a double or even triple helix of intertwined action. And the explosive firepower did not feel gratuitous to me. To me, it fed my mind with thoughts about the frailty we are in the shadow of our technology, and made my eyes wide and my heart pump with adrenaline at the same time!<br/><br/>Overall, I admire the beauty of the science fiction, the breath-taking cinematography, the sheer mammoth effort to bring this film of only two hours to us, and to be able to deliver 3 movies in a row like this, I just have to say ""Whoa"" again and look forward to their next project - not another Matrix, but another cinematic effort that'll blow us away again. Cheers, Wachowski brothers. I really enjoyed them all."
"definitive_MP3@hotmail.com","Null","0","0","6 November 2003"," Good, but not nearly as good as it could have been
","**Note:  Possible Spoilers**<br/><br/>While I thoroughly enjoyed the final installment in the Matrix trilogy, the film also left me with a disappointing hollow feeling because it was plain to see that while the film was good, it could have been SO much more than it is.  Several questions that are raised in the second movie remain unanswered in the third, and the movie itself raises some further questions which also never get addressed.  The first Matrix remains the best of the trilogy, and when you consider the fact that it was originally expected to flop, I think it becomes plain to see that the problem with the second and third installments is that the directors let their success get the better of them, and sort of ran amok with their own little universe, inserting unnecessary characters, pointless (if philosophical) dialogs, and sodomizing the rules of their universe which they laid down in the first movie.<br/><br/>For example, in the second movie, we are introduced to the ""Mirovingian"" (however you spell it), a sadistic, narcissistic, pseudo-intellectual frenchman who has NO BUSINESS BEING IN THE MOVIE WHATSOEVER.  To further annoy viewers, he controls a array of programs which blatantly break the rules of the Matrix by flying around, and phasing out of reality so that they can pass through solid matter, and so on, despite Morpheus's explanation in the first movie that ""even programs are subject to the rules of the Matrix"" (or something to that effect)...and aside from breaking continuity with the first movie in order to give Trinity and Morpheus some new friends to play with, these programs that can play by their own rules just don't fit logically, either...if it's possible to make a program that can do those sorts of things, then why are the agents as limited as they are?  Why wouldn't they have the power to blatantly break the rules as well? Aside from that, there are other things that just don't sit well with me...the keymaker is another POINTLESS character, and while the father of the Matrix is not, his story about ""multiple previous Zions"" is just laughably preposterous.  I remember thinking as I left the second movie ""okay, that thing about all the previous Zions was just the creator trying to bluff Neo into submitting, because he knew it was his only chance at stopping him,"" but alas, instead of going with the plausible, sensible explanation, the third movie CONFIRMS the story about all the previous Zions...throw in some other stuff about a ""train man"" that just doesn't make sense, and some corny scenes/bad acting/overacting, and an ending that doesn't leave the viewer with a sense of closure (and people saying that it's intentional so that viewers can ""invent their own future"" be damned...when I go to the movies I want to hear a story, from start to finish, and know what happens to all the characters interesting enough to care about at the end...if I wanted to invent my own endings I'd be writing scripts, not watching movies), and you've got what it takes to turn a potentially exceptional series into merely a good movie.<br/><br/>That aside, there IS a lot to like in this movie.  You can FEEL the hopelessness of the defenders of Zion as countless machines pour endlessly into their city.  The movie is very dark, and for once it doesn't seem to hold back at all.  This is by far the most violent movie in the series (though probably also the one with the LEAST amount of stunning, cinematic fight scenes...like the hallway scene from the first movie...), and it doesn't try to sugarcoat things...people fight and people die, some of them in some pretty terrible ways (I'd give this movie a cringe factor of about 5.5, with a 10 being something like Saving Private Ryan, or a gory, medium budget horror flick with a good plot and engaging characters who are slowly and violently...and graphically...killed).  This movie has much more ""real world"" time than the other two, and as such, it has a more realistic view of suffering and death.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the final installment of the Matrix is a good movie, but it works best when taken on its own, and not in conjunction with the first movie (though maybe in conjunction with the second).  When you think about what the first movie had the potential of becoming, and the fact that the second and third movies don't live up to that potential at all, it's extremely hard to not feel disappointed after seeing the ""conclusion"" of the trilogy.  However, this is not a bad movie, and is still quite enjoyable, especially if you can distance yourself from the expectations that the first movie created...the directors didn't pull it off, and that's sad, but this movie can still be enjoyed for what it is, and cherished for the memory of what it could have been, even though it wasn't."

"ncriggar","9","0","0","7 November 2003"," An incredible end from such humble beginnings
","It is nearly impossible to instantly classify The Matrilogy in certain terms: (Action, Drama, Comedy, etcetera). However, it is very easy to classify This Trilogy in a few ways. First off, to all of those who had star-bound minds after ""A New Hope"" came out, or to every nerd who has ever gone to a convention hoping to have Harrison Ford sign a glossy, The Matrix Trilogy is ""The Holy Trilogy"" of our generation. You must concede this. This film also actually crushes its two predecessors. ""Revolutions"" is extravagant with its CGI and visual effects, which topple any digital visualizations in the first two films. The incredible Battle on the Dock of Zion makes Gettysburg look like a knick from a Bic razor. It is absolutely wonderful to see a film with such a gripping and nail-biting war-scene, especially since said film is not conceptually based off of military scenes, but rather deep metaphysical philosophy. The acting has transgressed its falseness from the first two films, (think Reeves saying: ""I know kung-fu"" with a confused visage). The Wachowski brothers also made a very wise decision to move towards a score-oriented work from a soundtrack-oriented work (I love Rob Zombie, but he just wouldn't have worked for much of the music in this film). Well choreographed fighting (a Matrix staple) is abundant throughout, although it is even more dynamically integrated to the CGI in this film. What else can I say about it from a technical aspect (except that Film Buffs will study this one for decades to come). This brings me finally to the philosophy of The Matrix. You can be sure that university philosophy programs will begin to offer these courses again just as they did after the first film came out in 1999. They definitely should, considering the deepness and complexity of this film. (We are not just talking Plato any longer, we are talking Plato, Schopenhauer, Sartre, Hume, and even some Aquinas). It is philosophy-chowder that results in an encrypted but powerful message. TO ANY POTENTIAL VIEWER: Here are three options to think of before watching this film --- 1) I want to watch a film with audio visual properties so incredible that the film knocks my socks and under-roos off --- 2) I want to watch an incredibly philosophical film that forces me to think until my brain hurts --- 3) one plus two. The choice is yours... 9/10!"

They must be planing another movie or something because the cliff hanger in the end of this one is much more mysterious than in Reloaded. But besides a few dozen lose ends you can still count on a few cool fights... Well one cool fight...

","The third and final episode of the Matrix Trilogy, The Matrix Revolutions opened last week on 18,000 screens throughout the world, a fitting tribute to the cultural phenomenon the Wachowski Brothers films have become. Combining romance, awesome visuals, intergalactic adventure, and philosophy into a highly entertaining spectacle, ""Revolutions"" makes clear the enormous achievement of the entire project and brings it to a satisfying conclusion. Far from being a soulless video game, we identify with the characters, and a large part of the popularity of the series may have to do with people's need to find something in their lives that has meaning and purpose. We identify with Neo for his commitment and purpose, with Morpheus for his strength and integrity, with Trinity for her sacrifice and love. There is even a hero-worshiping kid (Clayton Watson), and of course the bad guy Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) who reminds us of all the corporate clones we have to face in our daily lives. <br/><br/>As the film opens, Neo (Keanu Reeves) is in a coma though he is actually trapped in all-white train station controlled by a scruffy-looking trainman (Bruce Spence), a worker in the ranks for the smooth-talking Merovingian (Lambert Wilson). The station scene is one of the most effective creations of the series, a cold and forbidding limbo between the machine world and the human. Here, Neo meets a lovely Indian girl named Sati (Tanveer Atwal), who introduces him to her parents and tells him she is going to live with the Oracle as her companion. As Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) seek advice from the Oracle (Mary Alice replacing the late Gloria Foster) on freeing Neo, Zion is about to be attacked by an army of robotic sentinels. To free Neo, With the help of Mifune (Nathaniel Lees), they pay a visit to the Merovingian at his S&M Club Hell.<br/><br/>
The action heats up in two different directions, one in the battle to save Zion with great assist from Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), the other an attempt by Neo and Trinity to enter the machine world to bargain with the artificial intelligence that has enslaved mankind for more than two centuries. The negotiation entails confronting and destroying Neo's mirror image, the multiplying Agent Smith, now a threat to all in return for peace. The battle sequences are state-of-the-art set pieces that include the all out war for Zion with squids flying in formation with octopus-like tentacles waving behind them, a shootout in the check room at Club Hell, the Star-Wars like penetration of Neo's ship into the machine world, and the final battle with Agent Smith. <br/><br/>Though these sequences go on too long, the human element is not lost and Neo's mission calls upon every last ounce of his personal courage and determination. Though the ending does not tie up all loose ends, ultimately, The Matrix Revolutions is about what it means to be human, to penetrate boundaries in life that had previously been off limits and to exercise our creative power in the area of choice. The film tells us that ""everything that has a beginning has an end"" but hints that the end is merely a new beginning. As the ship accelerates high above the Robot City to encounter a transcendental light, we see that another world is possible -- and train service is available."

Just when you recovered form Reloade's mediocre perfromance, Revolutions seals the trilogy's doomed fate. They should've left it at the first one. There are two cool scenes: the battle of Zion and the fight between Neo and Smith in the rain.

"garnet_gold14","10","0","0","6 November 2003"," Revolutions; A Great end to the Matrix Saga
","Last night I had the privilege to watch the final chapter of the Matrix trilogy. After sitting through the roller coaster ride of Revolutions I felt like it was a great end to maybe the greatest trilogy of this generation. The action was incredible and the special effects breathtaking; however, unlike reloaded, the special effects did not take over the movie. The war between Zion and the machines kept me and those around me on the edge of our seats and the final fight between Neo and Smith did not disappoint. All in all Revolutions was a great end to the Saga of Neo. You laugh, you cry, and you want to stand up and applaud when its all over. Many critics cried out over Reloaded that it could have been better and will most likely do the same after seeing Revolutions; however, I think the underlying problem is that all fans are trying to compare the sequels to the original and though they are all a following story, they are their own movie. Revolutions is a great end, a roller coaster ride of emotions and action that I recommend everyone to see."
"andy252K3","Null","0","0","6 November 2003"," Give ""Revolutions"" the respect it deserves!
","I believe that the prevailing concensus of ""Revolutions"" is unjust. Since when has a movie that has elements that require deep thought and deep philosophical consideration been a bad thing? The Matrix ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" did not follow the straightforward action ground breaking genre pattern of the first, true, but there were many aspects of the two the command respect.<br/><br/>First, many people are saying that ""Revolutions"" lacked characterization substance of the first film. I find this argument interesting. This movie is the third in a trilogy which is climactical ending to the series (""Every beginning has an end"" ) and was not meant to require a rehash of character development that the first two movies covered.<br/><br/>Secondly, the argument that ""Revolutions"" had too many loose ends is weak. It is true that there was some ambiguity at the end of the film, but I believe that was necessary to remain true to the theme of the movies which, in my opinion, was largely dealing with a self-actualizing voyage toward one's view on reality. This Neitzche-esque school of thought was presented through subtle hints throughout the series. Two cases that stick out in my memory are when Neo is the only one in the first movie who was not wearing sunglasses on his first trip back into the Matrix after discovering the truth, and when Neo is blinded but can still ""see"" in ""Revolutions."" This theme causes some things in the final movie to go unsaid to provide the watcher with ability to draw some conclusions for themselves.<br/><br/>If you are wanting ""Revolutions"" to lay down a ""tell all you know"" type ending to the series which is not all about CGI, explosions, and machine guns, then you can expect a certain level of disappointment. However, if you enjoy watching a glorious climax to an excellently thought out cornucopia blend of action, philosophy, and thought-provoking, then you will enjoy this movie greatly. I for one give the movie 8.5 out of 10."

"christinehclark","6","0","0","6 November 2003"," Meaning of Matrix Revolutions---Spoilers--Beware
","*****Spoilers for Matrix Revolutions--Beware<br/><br/>*****Spoilers for Matrix Revolutions<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolution theme is based heavily on `everything that has a beginning must have a end.'  `The One', Neo, as prophesized by the Oracle, has the ability to bring an end to the machine domination of the human minds via the Matrix.  The architect, who designed the Matrix, knows through trial and error, that not every human will accept this simulated world and will try to overthrow the machines.  Thus, in an effort to contain and control these humans, Mr. Smith is created as the `Anti-One' to basically keep humans who do not accept the Matrix program in check and lead `The One' to the Architect for rebooting purposes to purge all humans minus a minimal amount needed to sustain Zion.  Mr. Smith though becomes a rogue program-undisciplined and questions his existence and purpose.<br/><br/>
The only way the Matrix can sustain its existence is by rebooting; however, this can only be done by humans because their minds must be willing to accept this existence or simulation.   Revolution starts out with the ramifications of Neo not rebooting the system; the machines coming to kill the all humans in Zion-outside the Matrix.<br/><br/>Mr. Smith, the rogue program, is acting more like a virus than a program created to perform a sequence of operations, also threatening the existence of the matrix.  The Oracle, in her infinite wisdom understands this and allows Smith to overtake her even though she could have evaded him-she has a purpose-Mr. Smith is able to continue on his path of elimination, versus pursing her perpetuating his existence.<br/><br/>Neo, in the last scene, shows that he understands that Mr. Smith's existence was entirely dependent on his existence-there is no purpose for the `Anti-One' if the `One' dead.  In this scene, the Oracle wisdom again resonates as Mr. Smith confusingly states, `everything that has a beginning has an end.'  Neo allows Smith to kill him.  Mr. Smith Ends.<br/><br/>
The roles and subsequent actions we partake may appear simple, though they in fact may be much more complex and vise versa.  The `free will' we possess provides us the opportunity for insight.  We should utilize this insight and not take things for their surface value.<br/><br/>The Oracle's purpose is to show the value of belief and its ability to propel us to find the answers within ourselves.  Our belief system can empower us to overcome obstacles.  The Oracle should never die."

","""The Matrix"" was an amazing movie. Innovative, mindblowing...just insane. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" was totally satisfying. Not mindblowing like the original, but full of plenty action and suspense. It certainly left me pining for ""The Matrix Revolutions,"" and I was fully expecting to be blown away by the final installment of this trilogy. Yeah, I was blown away. This was the worst movie I have ever seen. Towards the end of ""Reloaded,"" when Neo had to make his ultimate choice after the Architect had clearly given him his options, I thought, ""Wow...how are they possibly going to follow up on this, after all the doom that the Architect guaranteed?"" and ""How is Zion not going to fall? How can they get out of this situation?"" and whatnot. Well, here's how: the Architect's comments barely came up in ""Revolutions."" One small reference by the Oracle (which, in essence, hastily denounced his comments as being meaningless). This is when I knew trouble was brewing. This could have ended in so many ways. I figured that ""Revolutions"" would create a sense of closure by bringing everything back around to the first movie. (Like, maybe somehow Neo could have gotten out of the Matrix and gone back to his old days as a simple computer hacker.) Instead, it drifted further away, and although there was a bit of definite closure at the end, it was completely unsatisfying. The dialogue was horrible throughout the movie; there was barely any action; there were no mindblowing revelations. It was as if the Wachowskis couldn't think of a good way to end it, so they said, ""Let's make this painfully simple, and make a terrible film."" If you're a Matrix fan, you obviously have to go see this. So yeah, it's going to rake in a lot of money. But be forewarned. If you're walking in there expecting to be blown away (as I was), prepare to walk out really REALLY angry and disappointed (which I was). Maybe if you're expecting just to be simply entertained, you'll enjoy it. But the Matrix is about so much more than entertainment...although apparently not anymore. It's all about the box office now. This is what happens when awesome things spin out of control and become horrendous things: ""The Matrix Revolutions."""

At least someone could have gone home happy. The best way to describe this movie is.. for the whole series actually.. is that it's like having interruptus during $ex. Great foreplay for the first one that had us all drooling for more, the second one tantalized us more than it pleased us, and when it came time to deliver the finale- what we got was climactic disappointment. I wasn't so enthusiastic about ""Reloaded"" (no pun intended) either, but I assured myself that the third part would make everything make sense; solve all the weird mysteries; and still have room for some shocker revelation that would blow away all sci-fi films. Instead, the only landmark this movie seems to set is that it's the first time the story is better told in a video game than in a movie. At least the second one had a really kick ass car chase scene on the highway where Morpheus got to shine as he took down a BMW with a samurai blade. And there were also those cool badass albino twins. This one had no interesting villains- introduced too many characters too late (not that they were all bad characters - just that there were too many and too short of time to do their development), and no interesting philosophical questions to debate. The original three: Trinity, Morpheus, and Neo get rather small and useless roles. It seems even the walk-ons and stage-hands were able to squeeze into this one (who the heck was that reloader kid? And did they really need Sati in that many scenes?). If its anything to the movie's credit- most of the critcism derives from hyping up the trilogy to such an extent only to offer a B quality flick in the end. The Zion battle was cool in general, but I think everyone expected the whole movie to be that gripping. It's a shame they didn't involve the original 3 more- as it would have given the movie more depth. In my book, I rate this as a 4.5 which translates to ""not worth seeing in the theatre; wait for it on VHS- don't even bother with the DVD much less some special director's cut version""<br/><br/>Man, Return of the King better be good... as must the next Star Wars..."

The dialogue AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHh. sitting at lunch today, before we went to see revolutions, i was telling my wife about how bad the dialogue was in the second movie.  i used the example i believe is from plan 9 from outer space, the old Ed Wood movie ""he's dead, murdered, and someone's responsible"" We both laughed out loud during revolutions as that line was actually repeated.  this line is well noted as the one of the worst in movie history so i have to wonder if the directors didnt put it there on purpose. why? so I would talk about it later? if so the joke is on us.... and them...... yes ill talk, but i have nothing good to say. that is only one of the few examples of god awful dialogue. see if you can spot it among the rest of the crap.  this movie reminds me of the kid in school who uses large words to convince himself hes smart.  and like that kid this flick comes off as pompous. the special effects are better than youve seen in any other movie. flawlessly incorporated into the real life action.  but there are no sequences in this movie to top the ones in the second, in fact i think they fall far short of what reloaded gave us in the chase/fight scene or the ""burly brawl"" with the multiple agent smiths. that said ill quote george lucas's thoughts on special effects in movies, i think he should know a little about the subject.  he said ""a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.""  the 2 matrix sequels test and prove that axiom. in reloaded the effects kept the movie from drowning in bad dialogue, bad acting, bad storytelling, but in revolutions even the effects could not distract me from one awful scene after another. its easy to see what the makers were going for... and it was a good, certainly attainable goal. i imagine they got complete creative control when they dealt to make the sequals, so they had no one to tell them which scene was weak, which was repetitive, which was pointless to the story line. no one to tell them what was missing. so what did i like? precious little. hugo weaving, who plays agent smith once again steals every scene with his subtle, subdued rage routine.  Ian Bliss who portrays agent smith as BANE in the real world stole the movie. if they were going to drag on with a scene, why couldnt they have dragged on with his movie stealing portrayal of smith. now that im at the end of my rant, remember...... i wanted it to be good. and i take back what i said earlier about the directors not reaching they're goal. they got my 7 bucks. my wife loved it. but shes always been the forgiving type, and likes ambiguous storylines"

If you enjoyed the Matrix, and Reloaded, there is no question you will think this movie rocks.  It is a thrilling conclusion to the trilogy. A common criticism raised at Reloaded was that it did not ""top"" the Matrix in terms of inventiveness, and I feel strongly that was always an impossible challenge - as the cast and crew of the original said, they were very much ""under the radar"", and the surprises were a large part of what made that movie so special.

I sat in the theater, stunned - it is one of the best films I've ever seen.  Beyond the amazing special effects, beyond the hype and long anticipation for this film and some closure, the story line is perfect.  Not Hollywood, but perfect.<br/><br/>I suppose maybe the ending for the Hollywood types would be Trinity waking up in bed, going into the bathroom to find Neo taking a shower, who greets her with, ""Hey hon -  you oversleep?  It's time to go to work.""  After all, it worked in Dallas.<br/><br/>The battle of Zion is almost too much to get your arms around in a single viewing; it sets a new standard in special effects.  Comparing this to the battle scene in, say, Attack of the Clones, is laughable.  The casting was great, except Gloria Foster was regretfully missed.  The explanation of her changed look (as Mary Alice) worked on several levels, and was touching without being interruptive.  Young Tanveer Atwal as Sati was an exceptional casting decision.  Jada Pinkett Smith, piloting through the mechanical line, was great.  (For a brief moment, I couldn't help but to compare this scene with Luke Skywalker going down the trench on the Death Star so many years ago, and wonder in awe what the technology will bring us in another 25 years!)<br/><br/>This trilogy is, simply, historic.

"megashub","5","0","0","10 November 2003"," An educated take on Matrix Revolutions.
","Matrix: Revolutions feels more like Matrix Reloaded: Part 2. And here's why.<br/><br/>
[POSSIBLE GENERAL SPOILER(S) AHEAD]<br/><br/>In the original Matrix, our story ends with a newly-freed Neo coming to the realization of what and who he really is.<br/><br/>In Matrix Reloaded, our story ends with the realization that there might possibly be 2 Matrices. That is, one matrix within another. Simply another system of control. One Matrix to house and heard the minds of the masses - those who remain unaware of the hoax, and one Matrix to control and heard those who, in their very nature, rebel against protocol and 'the system'.<br/><br/>
In Matrix Revolutions - NOTHING HAPPENS. For 2 hours and 10 minutes. All we see is the degradation of storyline. While Matrix Reloaded at the very least contributed to the furthering of the plot and story, Matrix Revolutions ignores the main characters almost entirely, instead retreating to the scenario as a whole - leaving it's viewers utterly confused. While the effects were stunning, and the action sequences (with the exception of a few) were breathtaking - no questions were answered, no loose ends tied up, and no explanations provided. At the end, we're all left to wonder what we just spent our money and time doing.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: Matrix Revolutions was a phenomenal Part 2 to Reloaded. However, the answers, if there even are any at this point, are still yet to come. In my opinion, Part 3 of the Matrix has not arrived yet. Many of us sit in fear, chewing our nails, simply waiting to see how badly the brothers can possibly flush their seemingly-flawless brainchild down the toilet in any more of a wasteful way.<br/><br/>Overall: An immeasurable disappointment from the most unlikely of sources."
"MHSSS_Number_1","9","0","0","6 November 2003"," The balance returns. *Potential Spoilers if you haven't seen the first two*
","*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MY OPINIONS.  READ IT FOR WHAT THEY'RE WORTH, THEN FORM YOUR OWN, BUT DON'T GET ANGRY ABOUT ANYTHING IN HERE.*<br/><br/>
Well, the last chapter in the much hyped series has come, and I left the theater with an overall good feeling.  The first one walked a fine line of story and great action, and walked it very well.  The second movie, in my opinion, lost itself in long scenes of inane techno-babble, bringing up questions that were never solidly answered.  The third movie moves the series a lot closer to the balance, but leaning more towards action, and losing some story elements.  The way I look at it, this was a good way to balance out the second movie.<br/><br/>
In the original Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers gave us something that we hadn't seen done well in a long time, if ever.  They gave us a great action movie that had a great story to go along with it.  Action movies, in general, give us some great eye candy but don't have a lot of substance to them.  They're entertaining, but not deep.  Dramas on the other hand, don't have much action but are very deep.  The Matrix struck a balance between the two, giving us action sequences that looked great, along with a story that you could delve into and debate about for years.  It is one of my favorite movies, probably in the second half of the top ten.<br/><br/>
In The Matrix: Reloaded, the balance was lost, horribly, horribly lost. It still had some great action sequences (blatant CG aside, the Agent Smiths fight) but those were overshadowed and pushed aside.  Because plunked between those scenes were long speeches by some character we've never seen before babbling about some inane topic that never comes up again.  The Merovingian's Causality speech?  I knew what he was talking about, but didn't see much reason for it being there.  Also, Reloaded contains one of my most hated scenes in any movie I've ever seen.  That being the combination Zion rave + Neo/Trinity sex scene.  I'm not going to go further than that, but I hate that scene with all of my being.  Overall, the action scenes were still very good, but the speeches threw the balance totally out of whack, and Reloaded's pacing felt very odd because of it.<br/><br/>
The Matrix: Revolutions found its way much closer to the balance, but was not without its flaws.  The pacing of the movie was much better than Reloaded's, caused by the absence of the long sermons that ran rampant within the second movie.  The action sequences were, as usual, highly entertaining.  One of the main problems I had, however, was with the ending. It didn't seem to answer all of the questions, especially not the ones brought up in Reloaded.  I didn't feel a sense of closure when I walked out of the theater.  To compare it to another trilogy, the ending of Return of the Jedi seemed much better to me.  An epic trilogy brought to a full closing.  You feel satisfied after watching it.  I didn't feel that way after this movie.  Also, some of the dialogue came off as downright cheesy, worse than anything in the first two movies.  I said Niobe's ""No, we did it"" line before she did, and I had no previous knowledge about that scene. (Don't know what I'm talking about? I'm not going to explain it, so watch the movie.)    Also, this movie leaned more towards the action side of things than the first two movies did, leaving out some of the story elements that I greatly enjoyed.  Despite the problems this movie had, I enjoyed it far more than Reloaded, but not quite as much as the first movie.  On that note, I doubt anything will live up to the first one, simply because it came first.  It was fresh at the time.  The third time around, some of the magic was gone.<br/><br/>
Another potential gripe about Revolutions that ties into the loss of story, is that some formerly major characters are pushed into the background.  In this movie, we barely saw Morpheus, and he really didn't do much.  The Merovingian and Persephone,(his wife) who seemed so important in Reloaded, are suddenly relegated to a few minutes of screen time, never to be heard from again.  The same can be said for the Architect, Link, Commander Lock, and others.  This movie focuses on a few characters, pushing the rest aside. Fortunately, one of the lead characters is Agent Smith.  He is one of, if not the most interesting character in the series, and my personal favorite. In the original, when he classifies humans as parasites, and that whole speech when he's alone with Morpheus made my spine tingle.  But, that's not a subject to be delved into right now.<br/><br/>
Real quick, I'd like to say something to the people who are going to be reading this.  For those of you who support Reloaded's speeches, and are thinking that I just didn't understand, think again.  I perfectly understood what they were about; my problem came in the why of things.  Those sequences could've been cut or shortened, and nothing important to the storyline of the movie would have been lost.  In fact, that would have improved the pacing of the movie greatly.  I just think that the Wachowski's made a mistake in sacrificing balance in an attempt to further explain their universe.  That brings me to another gripe about the Wachowskis, while I'm at it.  In the Architect scene, it felt to me like they didn't want us to understand what was going on.  With the Neo's in the television screens in the background the whole time, it was very difficult to catch everything the Architect was saying, which you needed to.  It was like they were intentionally trying to distract and confuse us, which I think was a stupid move.  That and the other speeches turned off casual fans of the movie. But, enough of my griping, back to the subject at hand.<br/><br/>
For those of you who have had the attention span to read this whole thing, congratulations.  You're the people who probably understood more of what went on in these movies.  You know, the people who delved a little deeper, thought about it, and discussed it with your like-minded friends.  But, I digress once again...  The Matrix: Revolutions was a return to what made the first movie great, the balance.  Something just felt off about Reloaded, but no so here.  Though not as deep or insightful as the orginal Matrix, this is still a great movie.  The loss of story feels much more natural than when it was heaped onto us in copious amounts.  The action sequences were superb, the movie well-paced, but it still had problems.  The lack of an appropriate ending, some poorly written dialogue, and the delegation of some formerly important characters, namely.  But, look past these and you've got a great movie.

","i first saw the matrix when it came off of pay-per view, and was absolutely blown away, not only by the special effects, and the action, but by the fascinating story that was woven into it. after its release, we were all told how there were going to make it into a trilogy and everyone who loved the matrix COULD NOT WAIT until they were released. we all had to know how it was going to end. and i don't know if anyone predicted from the first one how exactly it was going to end, but we all had our thoughts. once reloaded came out, i believe that a lot of people were disappointed with it because the storyline altered so far from what they had made up in their own minds. i personally didn't like it as much for a few reasons. keanu reeves, may have the acting capacity to play a bland calm super hero, but he does not have the capacity to show love or serious emotion. another was that every time that neo could get into a fight, he did. reloaded was simply about showing neo in the most jaw dropping fight scenes ever and as much as possible; it left the wonderful story telling of the first one behind. the 10 minute rave/sex scene didn't really do much for me either. i can see the theme of life they were trying to portray but they took it a little too far. overall a decent action movie, with some (maybe overdone) fighting/chase scenes though. with reloaded still recently in a lot of peoples minds, and everyone anxious to see whether or not they were right about the ending, we all rushed to see revolutions on Wednesday. from the first 10 minutes i at least saw that his one was going to return to the intellectual story as the first. throughout the movie, there weren't as many useless fight scenes or love scenes past a mere kiss or hug. the story flowed and suspense was issued throughout. the plot didn't revolve around neo kicking ass, but more around the salvation of zion, and the men and women in charge of it. now the ending, the final showdown with smith and the aftereffects, i understand that a lot of people didn't like, and thats fine because its your opinion, but let my give you mine. i believe that people were disappointed because the ending was not what they had predicted and analyzed four years ago. i personally tried as hard as i could not to form any preconceptions about the ending. and it is for this reason that the ending was much better than i could have anticipated. the fact that the ending was open to multiple interpretations was awesome. this way everyone can make up what really happened in their minds instead of directly being told. overall a wonderful conclusion to the trilogy."

","A spectacular finish to the Matrix trilogy chock-full of all your favourite characters and new and exciting locations. Revolutions takes the hardcore philosophies brought up in Reloaded and uses them to fuel an action-packed visual orgy that dares to take us where no film has before. Such powerful and epic predicaments as the looming destruction of the human race and the fate of the One studs Revolutions with a rigid backplot that is slammed through the screen by the film's superb cast and special effects. Revolutions will leave you sitting in a puddle of satisfaction and possibly even saltwater following the ultra climactic finale where what once was a beginning comes spiralling down into a sharp end. Revolutions is the most amazing sci-fi flick to come off of the big screen for a long long time! 5 STARS *****"

","With an anticipation that has not been rivaled by any other film, I waited desperately in line for the opening of the doors to the Matrix Revolutions. I sat down and could hardly believe I was about to watch the movie that would be the definitive action/sci fi movie ever. WOW! was I wrong!<br/><br/>What were the Wachowski Brothers thinking? This movie does not deserve to share the title of Matrix with the first one. There should never have been a second or third. And now, there's even talk of a fourth because of the ridiculous way they ended this miserable film. Maybe I'm just speaking from spite. Maybe I was expecting WAY too much. I am, however, fairly confident that no matter who looks at it, they will agree that this is not a great movie.<br/><br/>I left the theater feeling as if nothing had been resolved. It was too ambiguous. I decided that if I were a part of the matrix, I would not want to leave it after what happened. If there is one word to describe this film, it is WHY!!!<br/><br/>If you have had the great fortune of not having watched the second, do not, under any circumstance, see the last two in the trilogy.

After being thoroughly let down by Reloaded, I figured that Revolutions still had a chance to save the trilogy, but instead it followed Reloaded's lead and drove it straight into the toilet. I know you can't polish a turd, but I didn't think you could turn a diamond into a soggy piece of crap.  Unfortunately the Wachowski Brothers did just that.  1/10."

","Having been bitterly disappointed with Matrix Reloaded, I went to see this last installment with much lower expectations. My first impression was: better than Reloaded, not quite up to the original. This movie is by far the least mystical in the series, more on the «let it all hang out» side. Everything is now shown and revealed. This movie is visually stunning, quick paced, action packed extravaganza that doesn't suffer from pointless, boring, never-ending scenes as Reloaded did.<br/><br/>*Spoilers*<br/><br/>I do have a problem with it, though. And that is in the half-a** resolution in the end, a seaming peace that is no real victory. Originally I wanted Neo to destroy the machines, liberate mankind, restore the world.... but then I reconsidered.<br/><br/>Having read another viewer's comment I understand why that wouldn't be right: Neo is and must be the savior of all: men and machines/programs made in human image alike. However, I wish they have taken it just one step further.<br/><br/>The scene with him and Trinity flying into the scorched skies, over the clouds where sun still shines had such potential for a proper resolution: after Neo defeated Agent Smith (liberating the machines from him), brokered peace between Zion and Matrix and died, he should have been revealed as truly «the One» - the one who can (no longer living in flesh) restore the skies and truly liberate both machines and men: machines would have been given the proper power source and be truly free of their need of men as power sources, and men would be free to live alongside the machines.<br/><br/>
«Machine City» and «Human City» would coexist as two civilizations living in peace, and the Matrix would no longer be a prison but a world that bridges the two: where programs live and people can visit and exchange knowledge and experiences. This is the ending I would like to see as the proper resolution to this story.<br/><br/>Still, I give this one 8/10."

","I could go on in the spirit of other, trying to give opinions about concepts I don't understand. I could apply criticism about computer graphics that I can not sort out of the real bits of a movie.  I could even try to sort the genre of the movie as comedy in October, because I saw the first secret screening they did in May!!!!!!  You didn't know about that? Well that's because it never happened just like the screenings a few people saw before the worldwide instant release of the film.  I could do all of the above and plenty more by following other narrow minded, misguided and  confused people but instead I will give real comments and offer my thoughts and feelings about the film instead of  pointless sarcastic and egoistic comments. Matrix Revolutions is a Japanime but instead of drawings there are real actors, real cameras, and state of the art computer graphic application. All these and much more is a result of the almost limitless resources the W.bros-(double meaning) had available.  The Architect(s) of the Matrix did an excellent job.  They wrote the last code for the system in a near perfect manner.  Unfortunately the anomaly always exists.  Mostly in peoples minds. I was more than overwhelmed by an exhilarating feeling when I saw the first ever Anime with real actors on the big screen.  This was kudos for movie making.  It all started with the Matrix, the idea was there, the storyline was there, and the output was excellent, but it only strokes the japanime stature.  In reloaded we see this output evolving to catch Japanime spirit even more.  And there is, Matrix revolutions, not a hybrid but a pure anime. Correction, it's the revolution and the evolution of an anime.  Anime is a genre by itself and people that don't know about anime should give it a try because it could help them understand a lot more about the concept. People that are familiar with Anime and went deeper into it they know just what the heck I am babbling about. Returning to Matrix Revolutions movie I realize that my mind is still plagued in the Matrix processing the philosophy of the film thus reminding me of the first Matrix.  What can anyone say about the level of the CG application in this movie, simply astonishing?  The CG technology and techniques used in the matrix opened the gate towards Japanime style movies so beware people because this is the real revolution. The soundtrack was ones again superb. Talent for movie making is glowing like radioactive in this movie. What else can anyone say?"

","The Wachowski brothers have achieved their goal: to create a fun, action-packed movie trilogy that also brings up huge philosophical questions and truths.<br/><br/>Many who loved the original ""Matrix"" hated ""The Matrix Reloaded"", feeling that the movie was corny, had many scenes that were useless and that most of the philosophy was long and unintelligable.  I, however, am in the minority that liked Reloaded.  The first time I saw it, there were a few things I didn't understand and I felt the need to see it again, and everytime I watch it, I understand more of The Architect scene and where the overall movie is going.<br/><br/>Before seeing ""Revolutions"", I regretfully read a review on Aint It Cool News chock full of spoilers.  Therefore, my good review of ""Revolutions"" might be partly do to the fact that my expectations going in were poor because what I read basically left out all the good things about this movie and made the film seem choppy.  I'm never doing that again!<br/><br/>The movie does have its problems, but I think these are the same ones from the other two films:  Keanu Reeves' gives a stiff performance, and the Wachowski brothers couldn't write a romance scene to save their lives. The overall trilogy is also one where it seems as if the plot is the main character, and the characters are slaves to it.  But that's okay, and it's actually ironic considering the plot is about humans who are slaves to machines.<br/><br/>When the ending came, I was pleasantly surprised.  It made me think about many philosophical issues, one being (possible spoiler) that two opposing sides can only have peace when they both have a common enemy.  The Wachowski brothers made the trilogy they wanted to make, and envoked in the audience what they set out to."

There are many wondrous moments, but unfortunately only a few bits of trademark Wachowski humor. It is a much more serious movie than the others and the gravity of it all began to wear on me by the end.  The special effects sequences are inventive and visually stunning, though the print I saw seemed very dark in places.  I also fear that some of the effort that would otherwise have gone into the story and filmmaking was lost to these sequences.  I can think of about a dozen really cool shots and moments of drama, suspence, and confrontation that could have added much to the movie, had they been included or indeed dreamed up in the first place.  The new Oracle actress is unfortunately not quite as perfectly Oracular in the timing of her lines, nor as expressive as her predecessor, though her voice is as close a match as you could wish for. If I hadn't been spoiled by the first two movies I'm sure I would have rated this one higher.  As it is, 7/10.  Maybe there will be an extended version or director's cut someday that will patch the holes.  I can only hope."

I read reviews that said that audiences laughed at the dialogue but the only time anyone laughed when I was there was in the right places.<br/><br/>You can expect to see Keanu in the beginning, middle and end.

","My Rating: *1/2 out of ****.<br/><br/>In 1999, The Matrix debut and was an unexpected success, theatrically and on home video. It was such a success that the Wachowski Brothers, who are the creators of the Matrix, said that it was the first part of a trilogy. Now after seeing #2 and #3, I think it would have been better if they had not done these.<br/><br/>The worse thing about Matrix Reloaded was its pretentious dialogue, that became unbearable near the end of the movie. During its first hour, this is pretty much what Revolutions has to offer and its not good. The conversations the characters have are overlong and tedious.<br/><br/>The second hour is a little better but still some scenes run overlong. The big battle of Zion is no better than ok. There is one visually impressive moment where the Sentinels swarm in together but that doesnt save it from being overlong. The battle at the end with Neo and Agent Smith starts out good but also becomes overlong. The most interesting scenes in the film take place in the machine city, they are visually stunning and are occasionally exciting (except for the emotional moment).<br/><br/>In terms of acting, theres not much to say. Keanu Reeves was paid $15 million dollars and he is not in the movie for long, nor does he say much. Carrie Anne Moss has lost her presence as Trinity, although she still looks great. Laurence Fishburne also doesnt do anything. I never saw the point of Monica Bellucci in this film, except to look good. She was also wasted in Reloaded. Jada Pinkett is fine for what she has to do. There is no surprise to me that Hugo Weaving gives the best performance as Agent Smith. Yet even as good as he is here, this is definitely his weakest turn.<br/><br/>The Wachowski Brothers have dug their own grave here. If Revolutions had been made a year or two after Reloaded, these problems might have been able to be fixed. But 6 months later there still evident and they damage it. I did not like Reloaded, but it could boast a few impressive action sequences. Revolutions had a problem doing that. Yet Matrix fans should still see Revolutions to see it how it ends. Its actually pretty underwhelming but at least its over. No more Matrix, for pure action this fall, I will take Kill Bill anyday over this crap."

I would suggest that anyone who missed the point of the films to pick up a copy of `Taking the red pill' give it a good reading and then go watch the movies again. The brothers put a lot of time into making this story believable and I think it comes across in a wonderful way. I think a lot of people dislike sequels because generally a sequel doesn't have the same bait & hook that the first film had. The first time I saw reloaded I thought most people wouldn't like it simply because the fight scenes didn't seem as grand as the first film but I think people need to realize that of course the action might seem a little less exciting because we all knew after seeing the first film that Neo could beat any agent. All the action aside, these movies convey a strong spiritual, philosophical and scientific view of our lives and why we are here.BECAUSE WE CHOOSE TO BE!

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Despite what you may have heard, this movie makes sense.  Here is what happens in a pure spoiler: People become so dependent upon machines that the machines threaten to enslave them.  In an effort to destroy the machines, humans destroy every power source on the planet, including every living thing except bacteria.  People are the only power supply available so the machines breed them and hook them up to a simulated world (the ""Matrix"") to keep them docile.  Some people connected to the Matrix detect it and break free to form a society called Zion.  These people have a limited ability to control the Matrix.  One special person called Neo is born who has vastly greater powers.  A program called the Oracle that understands human psychology sees a way to restore peace.  She decides to help Neo.  Neo inadvertantly creates a virus when he destroys an agent program named Smith. Smith reproduces exponentially and threatens to take over the Matrix. Neo sacrifices his life in order to destroy Smith and bring peace between man and machine.<br/><br/>Here are some minor quibbles: 1.  Why wouldn't the machines lobotomize people rather than going to the effort to create the Matrix?  A better explanation would have been that the machines use the brains of the humans as their computers. 2.  How does it improve the film that Neo can connect to the Matrix without cranial implants? 3.  Why does Neo need to go to the machine city to contact the machine boss? 4.  How does it improve the film that programs can fall in love and have children?"

","This movie has cardboard characters you could give a damn about, including an obvious Vasquez rip off from Aliens. Do the filmmakers actually expect me to care about any simple character they just throw in the mix? Am I supposed to care if these people in Zion are in danger or if they all died? I don't even know them and worst of all they're some of the most annoying and cliched characters I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Characters introduced in Reloaded were dismissed after a couple of scenes. And the worst part of all...Neo, Trinity and Morpheus are guest stars in their own movie. Morpheus got the worst of it. He's been reduced to a bum that's taking orders from Niobe. What happened to that strong leader we knew throughout the series? He's a punk in this movie. He doesn't take charge on anything.<br/><br/>Rehashed/overkill action sequences. The first action piece at Club Hell is nothing more than the lobby shootout from the first Matrix with people running on the ceiling. Why do they run on the ceiling? Hell if I know. I guess someone didn't tell these guys bullets still hit you even if you're upside down. And someone get Trinity some new moves, her stuff was played out after Reloaded. The Zion battle looked pretty for 2 minutes, after that it all looked the same. Superbrawl, same deal...I thought the sound effects were more interesting than anything on screen. And with Neo and Smith both wearing black the flying scenes didn't have much impact with the sky also being black. They blended right in so you could barely see them.<br/><br/>
Some of the most long winded scenes I've seen in awhile that prompted jeers from the audience. Trinity's death went so long I almost thought it was a spoof. And some of the dialogue was cringe-worthy...""Neo, I believe!!"" Ugh."

","LITTLE (IF ANY) SPOILERS HERE That is the only reason i can think they mess with the story. I´m one of the ones that actually think that Reloaded was a very good movie. The cool cliffhanger finale in Reloaded (with Neo showing his powers and Smith able to transport himself to the ""real"" world) was negated in Revolutions by one line The Oracle said in a bland movie that uses loads of CGI and gives no real explanation for the events at the end of Reloaded. I feel cheated but again, i refuse to believe that the Wachowski brothers intented Revolutions this way, but instead dumbed down the whole movie in reaction to the bad reviews Reloaded got (seems because the studio suggested that the confused Average Joe moviegoers don´t like a movie which actually requires you to think)...<br/><br/>BIG SPOILERS AHEAD ...and the end of the movie doesn´t have any more sense too, because the humans still are batteries for the machines and now the humans are happy to barely survive underground instead of keep fighting to release the others. The redeeming points of the movie are the last fight between Neo and Smith (superb scene) and maybe the cool mechas used in the defense of Zion. I hope someday the Wachowski brothers will give us their original vision of the Matrix Revolutions (in a redone ""Highlander 2"" way) but for now i´ll only consider the original Matrix and Matrix: Reloaded movies as part of the story."
"adbento","3","0","0","6 November 2003"," The absolute worst way to end the Matrix.
","The original Matrix was mysterious, groundbreaking, and extremely entertaining. Reloaded had some weak moments (such as the infamous Zion rave scene), yet it introduced some very promising elements to the Matrix story, and through a spectacular car chase, provided one of the most thrilling action sequences of all time. Revolutions is a complete disaster.  The ending is, to say the least, unsatisfying, the dialog is so cheesy and cliché it would of been more at home in a spoof of the Matrix, and the action sequences are boring and unoriginal.  For example, at various points in the move, the Wachoski brothers steal exact scenes from the first film only to change them slightly. Instead of being cleaver nods to the original Matrix, they end up as pathetic examples of all that is wrong in Revolutions.  Despite all of this, the movie is entertaining; it unfortuanatly, is not worthy of the title 'Matrix'.  I now know how Star Wars fans must of felt while cringing and groaning their way through Episode I.  Like Lucas, the Wachoski brothers ignorantly tarnished a cinematic masterpiece. (3/10)"

Portions of the fight between Smith and Neo were worthwhile, but constant bullet-time works poorly with hand-to-hand and takes away from the thrill of the fight. Never did a hit land without slow motion. It was both overdone and overkill. I envy a friend that I told not to watch Reloaded, because he will only ever see the original and never have to deal with this crap."

","After reading reviews about this final chapter in the Matrix trilogy, I was a tad concerned about the Neo-Trinity romance, the Architect-Oracle babblings and the inability of Revolutions to hold up the Matrix franchise's standard.  No concern was required.  This movie breaks ground in storytelling, special effects and although the acting may be viewed as static and uninspired, the performances of Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith), Ian Bliss (Agent Smith as Bane), and the nipple tweakers at the Merovingian's party by far make up for Moss and Reeves' wooden-like presence.<br/><br/>Possibly the most unbelievable epic battle in the history of film takes place at the dock of Zion.  The conversations between the more philosophical characters are short and hold great importance as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>Although nothing happened as I would have expected, it did happen, and it happened in a way that made a 2 hr movie pass in what seemed 45 minutes.<br/><br/>I applaud the Wachowski brothers for bringing us this final chapter that not only blew me away on it's own, but brought the second movie to life as well. One thing I realized is that when viewing a final chapter of a franchise like the Matrix, I am not so interested in how the story is told, I just want it to be told.  I needed to know what happened.  Surprisingly, the story is told, and it was worth my $15."
"duguaymd","8","0","0","6 November 2003"," Good action movie but a little disapointing *spoilers*
","I saw Revolutions last night and I have to say, I'm disapointed.  Don't get me wrong, I thought the movie was good -- right up until the end.  It's basically an all-out action flick, which is cool.  The Zion battle was exciting and well done.  I guess my problem with this movie is that it's not what I expected.  It still leaves alot of things unanswered from the first two movies.  Also, the ending is not really an ending.  The brothers kept saying that this movie would end the trilogy, but it doesn't.  I understand what the brothers were trying to do with the ending -- create something that isn't a Hollywood cliche, and make a statement about war and society.  I think I wanted to see an absolute ending, that is, either the machines or the humans win the war.  Instead, we're left with the machines retreating (at least for now).  The war sin't really over, it's just in limbo (at least that's how I understood the Oracle at the end).<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is, I liked the movie despite a slightly disapointing ending.  I was hoping for more action in the matrix (because let's face it, the action sequences in the matrix are what we all loved about the first two movies), but I still enjoyed watching the humans battle it out.  I think most people will give this movie a poor rating because they feel cheated by the ending.  It boils down to this -- you can never please everyone!<br/><br/>I intend on buying Reloaded & Revolutions on DVD because I think the triology is worth owning.  I also think that watching all three movies in a row may make some people feel better about the whole thing.<br/><br/>
One last comment; We should probably judge each movie on its own rather than comparing them."

Even the writers of Terminator 3 knew that.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves really did think he was the Terminator, you could tell by the way he ""acted"" every scene like a robot.<br/><br/>They did a good job of seeding questions in The Matrix and Reloaded, but failed to deliver any good explanations in Revolutions, just action. Nearly every problem faced by the humans was solved by brute force punch ups.<br/><br/>The problem is, if you dangle ""what if's.."" at an audience they'll come up with some good plausible explanations of there own. You then have to deliver an even better explanation in order for them to be satisfied. Fail and they'll be disappointed ... ""Well, my explanation was better...""<br/><br/>I really think Revolutions was rushed, a good example was the scene with the French Man demanding that he have the Oracle's eyes in exchange for Neo's safe passage back to the Matrix. Great! There's an opportunity to develop a sub-plot, or some clever dialogue to barter with him, but no, after fighting their way in and eventually agreeing to a ceasefire because they were heavily out numbered and out-gunned. What do they do? They beat everyone up!<br/><br/>
What was the point of the scene? Stretch the film out so we'd all have to pay the price of two cinema tickets?<br/><br/>The trend started by Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings of telling a story split over many films is a privilege deserved to few. It has to be a story based set of films, why else would you sit through three films? for the same action over and over again? Matrix R&R story was very thin.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions featured the same kind of macho-Americanism as Pearl Harbour. What was Sati's role in the film? The audience would sympathise with her if she wasn't so transparently in the script for just that purpose. Sorry, but you'll have to do better if you want to emote people. The 16 year old wannabe soldier another example?  Two poorly written characters.<br/><br/>Even if you did start to feel like it was a real struggle for survival between Humans and Machine, and waited on the edge of your seat for Neo to save the world, you'll feel empty by the time the credits roll.<br/><br/>It just failed to deliver on so many levels.<br/><br/>They put action before story, and effect before concept, character purpose before depth.

","This Movie is the 3rd of the series and I was rather excited to see it. I liked the first one (though I found the begining rather boring and almost fell asleep), I thought Reloaded was an excellent film with great action sequences, however this movie just died. I am sorry but I was all set to buy the trilogy when it came out but I think this movie just ruined it for me. Keanu Reeves is the most horrible actor I have ever watched. If you think he was bad in the first to you cant imagine this. I kept thinking he was going to all of a sudden turn to the screen and say excelent then jam out a little air guitar lead like in bill and ted (which in my opinion is better than this movie). I watched learning some importain plot points waiting for the first action sequence. Then there were a few pretty good camera angles and a little gun fight/ chase scene getting my mind ready for more action. But it didn't come! Nope instead there was another ""club hell"" half naked orgy scene which was in my opinion the only let down of Reloaded. However there was a rapid change of events that followed with a small fight and  I was liking it once again. Then the movie died down and my eyes were slowly closing till i saw a cool looking cut on a dudes face and wondered how it was done. Machines and humans fighting Machines and humans fighting Machines and humans fighting Machines and humans fighting Machines and humans fighting! Back and forth thats all you heard and saw pretty cool looking but it just got boring. Not to mention the pretty colored lighting Neo suposedly was seeing for what would of been an awesome kill scene. Then the moment came that I was waiting for... The end fight scene! I thought to myself ""this has to be good this is the last thing to end all action sequences in the series!"" but no it was okay but nothing like any of the action in the first or second. I did like the effects the rain made and one cool effect of a punch to the face but it just didnt get me excited. Then to cut things worse this Movie had the worst possible ending I could have imagined. I mean god!!! The Wachowski brothers must have had writers block nomore good ideas just had to wrap things up quick. Now I relize why this movie came out so quickly after the 2nd. It must have been rushed big time. Then to cut me even deaper there was nothing after the credits... Only see if true fan... WARNING IT MAY LET YOU DOWN."

","In THE MATRIX, the Wachovski brothers created a revolutionary action movie that bent the laws of physics and questioned the line between illusion and reality.  In the second film - THE MATRIX RELOADED - the action continued to be fresh, with one of the finest car chase sequences ever filmed, and the exposition of the mythology and the dialogue was transcendant.<br/><br/>The final film neither breaks new territory with its action sequences nor matches the story-telling of the first two.  The action essentially consists of good guys in war machines firing tremendous amounts of bullets at octopi-like Sentinels; it has netiher theimagination of the first film nor the cat-and-mouse intelligence of the second.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This film also doesn't answer several key questions raised in the first film.  For instance, why will the computers maintain an uneasy peace with the humans?  What's keepign them from breaking their agreement with Neo? The Architect gives an answer at teh end of the film that suggests that computers - unlike humans - keep their word; yet, computers have evidenced no such moral code in previous movies, and have no compunction about enslaving and murdering humans.<br/><br/>Another nagging question is: if Zion is in the real, physical world, and not in some computer-generated virtual reality (as the finale of the RELOADED sequel suggested), why are the computers attacking the humans in Zion with ""conventional"" machines?  Why not simply drop a nuclear bomb into the dome of Zion?<br/><br/>Finally, the film falls into formulaic patterns of ""bad guy shoots at the good guy but can't hit him; bad guy pounds good guy in a climactic martial arts battle sequence, but then good guy finds inner stregth and fights back.""<br/><br/>I found no revelations here, no surprises, no answers that i hadn't intuited at teh end of the second film.<br/><br/>All in all, a passable film, though one that disappointed great expectations."

","After I had seen the second part of Matrix (Matrix Reloaded) I wondered why the script originally was designed for three parts - The first Matrix told its own tale, it was a nice, exciting movie with lots of good ideas and characters that fit into the film. But the sequel seemed to be attached to the first part and I didn't have the impression that Matrix was originally intended for three episodes.<br/><br/>In Matrix Reloaded you get all the things you already got in the original one - there is Agent Smith, not one but hundreds, there are Morpeus, Trinity, Neo, the oracle, the sentinels. But there is Zion, yeahh, one new invention.<br/><br/>After the poor second part I hoped that Matrix Revolutions would astonish us all, but I was wrong. Even the third part only seems to be attached to the first one. There are again all the same leading characters and on the other hand there are also plenty of new characters who just don't fit in. We have some Love Stories which are simply senseless and boring. There is agent Smith again, this time not hundreds but even thousands of him - what a brilliant idea.<br/><br/>The fights are also the same, you won't guess who is fighting whom. The sentinels, the machine city and the fields of humans which were already introduced at the beginning of the trilogy are also in the third part - come on Wachowsky brothers I want new creatures, new exciting shots, new ideas and new pictures. And by the way, the end is as predictable as it seems to be.<br/><br/>For me, it seems, that Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions are just poor copies of the first, original one and I just can't believe that the script was designed for three parts, because the ideas, incursions and vagaries are only enough for one movie."

Unfortunately, I was left STILL wanting those answers. Even throwing aside that initial problem, this movie does not deliver any scene to match the Freeway scene of Reloaded.  The battle for Zion, while impressive, pales before the battle sequences in The Two Towers or the upcoming RotK (if the trailers can be believed).  Simply put, if a battle sequence is going to be the centerpiece, then it had better be worthy and I just didn't think it measured up. Next, I was disappointed with Smith being the big villain.  We were led to believe that The One would ultimately FREE humans from the MACHINES, not negotiate a peace settlement that pretty much does nothing but offer concessions.  I'm sorry, but I was not in the mood for a very one-sided STALEMATE (if that's possible).

","Went to see Matrix Revolutions and I would have to say I have somewhat mixed feelings on this. The first Matrix was excellent, both in visual and intellectual content. Second one was sort of a flop, they emphasized on the computerized special effects while trying to tie it together into the first movie. After walking out of the second one I thought they could have cut the first hour and a half out of it and still have not missed much of the second movie. I was anticipating Matrix Revolutions to be much like the first with even better special effects. I read a newspaper review which suggested it was very much like the first one so that gave me some confidence.<br/><br/>
Of course reviews are very much subjective...I did not think this movie was very similar or better than the first one, but it definitely had more depth than Matrix Reloaded. But, much like Reloaded, this one had unnecessary fluff inserted just to make it more appealing to a more general audience. At certain points the movie becomes very much a comedy which I found somewhat disappointing.<br/><br/>To argue the point of The Matrix was the best because it was all action. It actually didn't have as much action as people think, but the effects, the cinematography and the ideas were very ""new"" and the movie seemed to  be very short because of that.<br/><br/>I think Reloaded and Revolutions will be much more appreciated when the Trilogy DVD set comes out and people slowly gain more of an understanding how everything flows together."

This the third and last part of the Matrix-saga offers a few surprises although the characters are pretty much set. Second, the casting is great. You see no change in the sceptic Lock, and although Morpheus and Trinity seem to re-evaulate their trust in the Oracle they still don´t go against her advice. Something I do felt a bit dissapointed with was the fact that Merv and Persephone had such a small part in this movie. Granted, I would give pretty much everything I own for with Monica Belluci (Yes, she is stunningly beautiful and can act ok) but after the scenes in Matrix Reloaded I´m surprised not to have seen more of them, like a build up to nothing. And if Merv is so powerful how come this does not seem to concern Agent Smith at all? With such a complex plot, I am very content with the ending.

Neo has superpowers in the ""real"" world, but when Neo asks for an explanation, he gets no real answer.  Hands are waved to say that its magic, and who really knows... The Wachowski brothers decided to change the rules of the universe, and then failed to give any explanation for those changes.  What a let down!<br/><br/>

Most importent (and what it all boils down to) is LOVE.  The themes: Good/evil, man/machine, god/satan, Choice/control (not to mention the metaphor for our current state in the world...the blinders brought down all around us, the artifical culture is all around around us created to prevent us from thinking ouside the lines...these movies are a part of that machine..but perhaps they are trying to break out...like the matrix programs that can feel love?)  The questions: What does it mean to be alive? what is real? What do you believe?  those are just part of it as well.

","Like Reloaded before it, this movie sees the story of The Matrix move away from being a mainstream popcorn action movie and towards being a ""proper"" sci-fi movie and I think that is the problem. Action fans will be alienated by all the talking and sci-fi fans will be alienated by the glossy over-the-top action. I am lucky; I sit between these two extremes and appreciate both genres. I almost feel like the movie was made for me.<br/><br/>There were a couple of times when it became concerned that the movie was failing, however, by the end of the film I walked away very impressed.<br/><br/>I think time will be the judge of The Matrix Trilogy. The story ends leaving many questions unanswered. If left like this people will talk about it for years to come- as they still do with Blade Runner. I doubt the studio will be able to leave it at that. Whilst another movie in ten years time would be good, I expect a deluge of comic books, novels, cartoons and computer games spin-offs, to follow- destroying all hope for debate and discussion.<br/><br/>The movie will not necessarily appeal to fans of the Die Hard series or 2001: A Space odyssey. It sits perfectly in the middle."

","This movie is likened to a train wreck collision.<br/><br/>Two long giant trains collide on  a shared track and car by car get crushed into a pile with barely discernable and certainly unrecognizable parts. Each car of the train represents something mystcial and timeless created by the first movie and its contributions to the moviemaking arts and pop culture.<br/><br/>The second installment of the series, Reloaded, put the trains on this collision course.  It was up to the Wachowski brothers to rescue it by diverting the trains to just miss each other and to arrive at each respective station of glory safe and sound with an exciting near-collision.<br/><br/>Alas, instead in turn, each portion of the train was destroyed: first the engine of creativity crashed, followed by the cars of style and atmosphere, followed by surprise, Descartesian paradigm, Great characters, credible acting, tangible philosophical roots, and lastly, with the near laughable Rainbow ending, the caboose of coolness was crushed irrevocably with the rest of the train before it.<br/><br/>It is now no longer cool to like this franchise and all it stands for, or even looks and feels."

"tom123b","10","0","0","6 November 2003"," Enough with the Jesus analogies (Spoilers)
","All the critics seem to say that they hated how Neo was portrayed as Jesus. The Matrix trilgoy is about so much more than this though.  Yes the parallels are there, but ONLY because both Jesus and Neo made the right choices about life, NOT because the movie forces Neo into the role of Jesus. Having Agent Smith actually kill Neo was the perfect way to answer all the questions about the Matrix.<br/><br/>The Matrix was Agent Smith's world.  Just as Agent Smith was unbeatable in the Matrix, Neo, when he made the proper choices, was unbeatable in the real world.  Even when his defeat is close, Neo does not run, but forces Agent Smith to defeat him.  Of course, once Agent Smith kills Neo, his purpose is over, and so his program is deleted.  It was enough for Neo to make the right choices.  Even though this led to his defeat in the Matrix, it was all that was needed for victory in the real world.<br/><br/>Even the all knowing Oracle could only hope that he made this choice. This is where we see that Neo is better paralleled to humans than Jesus.  The Oracle did not know what he would choose.  As the last line of the movie says, she only ""believed.""  Unlike Jesus, Neo could have chosen to quit. What a great message to everyone who watches movies with concern for real life, instead of, like some spoiled child bored with their old games, looking only to be surprised by something original in the plot or special effects."
"admather","Null","0","0","6 November 2003"," Also disappointed
","(Possibly spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>Just saw Revolutions yesterday, and I've got to admit I was disappointed. Not just with the level of sub-Zen pish dialogue that the brothers have weaved into their movie (again), but also with the fact that once I came out of the cinema I just didn't care about what I'd just seen.<br/><br/>Watching the whole Matrix trilogy is a bit like going out on an all night bender - you start off having the time of your life, get a bit depressed, confused and subdued in the middle, and then just forget large chunks of the evening as you get drunker. Revolutions is the last stage. Reams of plotlines appear to have been forgotten in the haste to produce awe-inspiring CGI effects, whereas the final defence of Zion is fairly inconsequential. You don't care about the cannon-fodder gunners in their Aliens-rip-off robo-suits. Or the huddled masses of humankind cowering in the temple from millions of sentinels. It just washes over you with about as little earth-shattering profoundness as possible.<br/><br/>As for Neo and Trinity, the Wachowskis have managed to produce the kind truly woeful love dialogue that George Lucas would be proud of. ""I love you. You gave me my wish."" gushes Trinity as she lies impaled on about ten metal spikes (cue audience sniggering). And Neo's sudden ability to ""see"" the machine world after he's blinded? Pfhhrrt! What about the painfully obvious ""Smith's now in the real world"" thing that gets drawn on for about FIFTEEN MINUTES, even though the intelligent film-goer has realised that well before the cretins on screen do. Grrr...<br/><br/>As final showdowns go, however, its not bad at all. The effects in the ""real world"" are stunning, and the final Smith-vs-Neo battle is entertaining, but the over-schmaltzy ending belies what could have been a fairly dark and satisfying final scene. The problem is that instead of just sticking with the Matrix as a groundbreaking science fiction experience, the films have been permeated with a messiac, overblown spirituality that just doesn't work. Its the kind of pseudo-Zen, quasi-Kant, over-rated, lazy, flawed, spirituality-driven bollocks that you'd expect to hear in any undergraduate student's dorm after a few joints. And its forced down your throats so much it makes you sick.<br/><br/>Get Ridley Scott in to do a directors cut, slash the philosophy and fuse Reloaded and Revolutions together. Now THAT would be a great movie."

The show I attended at the IMAX was at 1 AM but was sold out over a day previous, so if going to IMAX, consider buying tickets in advance.

","Some people will like this, some people will not. This movie tones down on the action(only a little bit) to focus on the story telling. A lot of people may compare the whole Matrix story to the bible. For example, the first version of the Matrix could be compared to the garden of Eden. Neo as Jesus, Morpheus as a prophet, Smith as the anti-Christ etc. However, it is still a sci-fi and fantasy (depending on your spiritual beliefs) movie and it can be enjoyed as one. It has the standard ingredients: Action, melodrama, romance, tragedy, triumph. It also has a unusual ending that if you don't understand, you will find frustrating.

","More more more of everything.<br/><br/>More Sentinels than you could shake a Go-Bot at. References from other films began to creep - nay, run in to the film. I was tempted at one point, where Neo has a blindfold on, to say to my partner ""Use the force young Luke"" in a quiet section. You can't miss that one.<br/><br/>Regarding the story - it quite literally carries on from the previous one with no messing about explaining anything. Morpheus no longer seems to be the great Morpheus, being around his-ex turned him into a bumbling trainee pilot at times. Lots of story elements are left up in the air - it does get all religious at the end. A Trinity/Neo scene is excruciatingly long and 1950's Hollywood would be proud. From about 1/2 way through the film does go all Hollywood anyway with Lurve and cheesey little biopics taking the place of potential story tying up.<br/><br/>Agent Smith gets more manic & mental than ever (- possible!) then panics. Neo goes all Godly or should that be Jesus? The Oracle get a new shell account & risks it with the Architect & the end, goes a bit Disney. I'd like to have seen the credits, but will view them on a DVD or vid one day, but if they had used ""We don't need another hero"" at the end it would have been suitable.<br/><br/>Good film, never mind the story.<br/><br/>Matrix IV - I think so.

"puffykitty","5","0","0","6 November 2003"," The trilogy finally loses touch with itself
","After seeing Matrix Revolutions, one looks back to the original Matrix movie with a sense of nostalgia.  A young Mr Anderson awakens to his true potential in amongst a world which turns out to be much larger than he realizes.  We watch him grow & mature, and we as an audience sense a connection with his character - a vulnerable individual who has duty & responsibility thrust upon him, yet discovering his true potential in the process.  There was a level of sensitivity amongst the glossy action which endeared the audience to the characters.  We even grew to love the monotoned Agents.  The overall impressions left on the audience were created with a gentle touch - ranging from simple yet unusual camera angles to clever visual effects which enhanced the movie experience.  Neo flying away from the phone box hinted at an exciting promise which was never met in the final film.<br/><br/>The final movie in the trilogy seems to have resorted to the age-old Hollywood sledgehammer tricks of bigger explosions, crass one-liner dialogue, louder musical soundtrack and plenty of distracting shiny things. If wile & wit cannot be used to solve a problem, then the barrel of a gun certainly will.  It appears the creators have finally lost touch with their own film & forgotten what actually made the first movie successful;  the final result reeks of overindulgence, reminiscent of a musician playing a technically brilliant yet soulless performance.  New characters of mysterious origin are created & discarded seemingly at the whim of the film's creators, leaving the audience lost in the sea of excess."
"pgcstrike","6","0","0","6 November 2003"," The weakest film of the trilogy
","The Matrix Revolutions really feels as though the Wachowski brothers have run out of ideas, both for the fights/shootouts, and in terms of overall story development. The Matrix was visually stunning, thrilling, mysterious and complete in it's own right. The Matrix Reloaded was arguably overtly less ""cool and hip""(take Zion for instance; a sub-standard, post apocalyptic, Mad Max style dance club), and lacked the tension of the first film's scenes with its terrifying agents, but this was compensated for by intriguing character and plot development. Morpheus, for instance, ceased to be the apparently all knowing and seeing character of the first film, and developed into a man who's faith, whilst strong, may just be blinding his judgement. It was also implied that perhaps Zion itself was a part of the Matrix, designed especially to keep the small percentage of rebels happily fighting the good fight. This is a bleak but fasinating concept, which, when combined with the old stalwart, ""will history repeat itself/ can the loop be broken"" by Neo's choice this time around, made for a tantalising setup for the grand finale in The Matrix Revolutions. Sadly the new film begins with a very talky opening 20 minutes where most of the scriptwriter's energies seem to have been spent unconvincingly trying to explain why the Oracle is being played by a different actress, and very little else of any consequence is conveyed to us. Morpheus is given far too little to say and do before we get to the impressive battle with the machines to cheer us up. Then it's back to Agent Smith's quest to dominate everything, and an ultimately rather unsatisfying and inconclusive conclusion.  In short The Matrix Revolutions is nowhere near as smart, trendy or tense as the first movie and not as puzzlingly, fascinating as the second. If you see the film do what the word Revolutions suggests and complete the cycle by going back to the beginning of the trilogy and watch the first, and best film again."
"bimetale","9","0","0","6 November 2003"," Great live-action japanime movie <*minor spoilers*>
","I think I've finally reached a verdict on the Matrix trilogy : not only is it a comic book movie - it is truly a manga film (based on a comic that doesn't exist, but perfectly could have; by the way, most of the story boards and scene designs *were* done by a couple of accomplished comic book artists, including cult icon Frank Miller of ""Sin City"" fame)! The Wachowski bros. themselves have always been very clear about the anime influences in their work, and with the release of the (rather mediocre) Animatrix some time before the last two movies, it should have been clear to everyone what direction they were planning to go with the next two installments.<br/><br/>And fans of the genre will get themselves a smattering of goodness in this film : mecha battles, massive-scale robotic assaults, Dragonball-Z type combat sequences, frantic and Akira-esque tightly paced action sequences... And of course there are the cliches : the camp, the epics and the larger-than-life drama (like the obligate <START SPOILER>tragic death of the love interest</END SPOILER>) that forms an irrevocable part of the tradition. And the good thing about it : I think it actually works PERFECTLY! This is the first time a project of this type has been attempted on such a scale, making it in itself a milestone in action movie history. As far as I'm concerned, it is also one of the single best comic book films to be released in the last few years, better than the Spiderman movie, vastly superior to the X-Men soap operas (say `character-driven' one more time and I swear I'll break your neck) and in my opinion on par with seminal classics like the original Superman movie and Tim Burtons interpretation of Batman.<br/><br/>I thought the technical quality was also superior to anything seen in any of the first two movies. The SFX actually manage to create a realistic-looking Zion, and a truly apocalyptic machine city /Matrix core. Reloaded had a few scenes in which the CG was just a bit too obvious (especially when the hordes of agents Smith came into play), but that problem seems to have been eliminated in this final issue of the series. Overall the movie looks great. And it sounds nice too : the soundtrack is as epic, bombastic and campy as the rest of the movie, but it is very well performed and does the job nicely. Every frame, every scene is clearly well-planned and the brothers keep their (in my view : limited-talent) acting crew well in line. Even Keanu Reeves manages to make his character believable at times - an achievement knowing that in my not so humble opinion, Reeves just really can't act. Luckily, this is certainly no character-driven movie - none of the Matrix movies were. It's all about cartoon action fun with enough cool plot elements to keep you interested all the way through the ride.<br/><br/>The plot explores further into the story lines launched in Reloaded, and brings them to an epic and fitting conclusion. The only moment that felt ""off"" was the very ending of the film, which was (a) just a bit too melodramatic for my taste, and (b) was rather convoluted, in the same vein as Otomo's movie adaption of Akira but using a more christian inspired theme. Apart from that, I really had a roll watching this one.<br/><br/>All in all, it was worthwhile spending time in the personal cartoon-action universe of the Wachowski brothers and I'll look forward to their next work. Certainly worth watching, I think, even for non-anime lovers,. After reading this review, you should at least know what to expect.<br/><br/>A word about some of comments I've read on IMDB : it seems like opinions on Revolutions are as divided as over the previous episode. Personally, I liked ""Reloaded"" better than the first, and I like this one even more. Contrary to some people, I didn't see a philosophical treatise in the first - it was so campy you just couldn't really take it serious and most of it was *very directly* inspired by anime  with similar themes anyway. Nothing new there, certainly for the people who had seen previous movies using the same premise, like ""Dark City"" or ""The 13th Floor"". And the action wasn't nearly as groundbreaking as most people seemed to believe as well : bullet-time effects had been done before in a couple of other movies and Kung Fu had been coming back in style for a long time. Of the two high-profile martial arts flicks of that year, ""The Matrix"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", I have always considered ""Tiger"" to be the vastly superior film (and felt it was dearly cheated off of its ""Best Movie"" oscar - Gladiator? Sheesh...). Reloaded had more action, more fights, with more, really groundbreaking visuals (maybe a bit too ""on the edge"" even sometimes), less opportunity for Reeves to show he can't act and more and better plot twists. What more could one ask for? Well, hear ye, hear ye : I feel that what more you could ask for, you get it here! If you really  hate the style of Japanese animation, don't go watch it, but one shouldn't  break down on a film that is truly a milestone in its genre exactly for being just that."
"philosophicalzombie","3","0","0","6 November 2003"," The worst degeneration of a potentially great saga in film history
","5 things seriously wrong with Revolutions (& Reloaded) (SPOILERS!)<br/><br/>1. BANE What the hell was the point of that? First, in Reloaded they feature the completely unprecedented act of having a machine intelligence take over a human brain (How the fvck?), and for what purpose? Absolutely none. This stupid sidetrack did absolutely nothing to advance the main plot except create a little bit of tension for Neo and Trin. Clumsy, and just typical of the shoddy plot machinations in these 2 films.<br/><br/>2. THE DIALOGUE. Oh my god, how many times must we hear a spurious variant of ""I/we can do it because I believe/have to"". Utterly trite and the worst of Hollywood tradition. While the first film teetered tentatively on the brink of awkward cliche, but with more than enough charisma and vision to hold it back, these two dived in head-first and relished in it. Ughhh.<br/><br/>3. THE RULES. The first film kept you guessing, surmising, speculating intently, but ultimately forming a nice cohesive 'theory' of how the Matrix worked. These two bent, broke, and mercilessly plundered all such boundaries to the point where you could not possibly give a sh1t about anything that happened as there could always be some new piece of bollocks they could throw at you to explain away any stupid-ass situation in which the characters might find themselves. About 1/2way into Revolutions I gave up trying to make any sense of 'the rules' as I concluded that there weren't any, just whatever fatuous whim meandered the weak plot loosely in the direction in which it was supposed to head.<br/><br/>4. THE ACTION vs THE EXPOSITION. The first film was a seamless blend of exciting, mind-bending ideas, seamlessly intertwined with some of the most spectacular action ever seen. It rates among my top films for clever, entertaining exposition. There is a LOT of gobbledy-gook explained in the first film, but it is so exciting and breathtakingly revealed that you lap it up. The next 2 films just turn that around so that the distinction between the exposition and the action is so jarring it is painful. Reloaded consisted entirely of pointless fight scenes (Neo engaging in fisticuffs with a couple of nobody agents, Neo vs Seraph) with no real drama in them, awkwardly intercut with a lot of talky bollocks, shot with all the flair of a soap opera. Revolutions, while being slightly better in this regard, still relied on a hell of a lot of really, really contrived crap to create any sense of drama in the scenes (see BANE, above).<br/><br/>5. A BETRAYAL OF THE FIRST FILM. This is what disappoints me the most. After all, if I didn't really like the first one, I wouldn't give a rat's ass whether these 2 were any good or not. Seeing Neo fly off into the blue, to the perfectly synced Rage Against The Machine, I was filled with such a great sense of wonder and excitement for where this story could go. As it turned out, I would rather have not found out. Some have maintained that the W's conceived this as a trilogy from the outset, but there's just no way I can believe that. The sequel stories are so forced and contrived they feel like they're made by some hack studio keen to quickly cash in on the success and the 'cool bits' of the first. There is no way on earth any major studio would have funded these shockingly written scripts if they weren't standing on the shoulders of a giant. Honestly, these scripts feel like first drafts. I think what annoys me the most is that these could have been good films. There's a lot of spectacular, beautiful stuff in there with some great, exciting ideas, but no focus. Why, oh why, couldn't they have just worked a little bit harder (OK, a lot harder) and nailed the script? 'Cos they knew they'd make a fortune regardless? Sad, but probably true."
"liquidhorse","Null","0","0","6 November 2003"," I agree and disagree...well, mostly disagree.
","Firstly, I loved it.  It answered my questions about the story, and left me with more to ponder.  Yes, indeed, there's much the brothers could have done with the surface story and whatnot, but like Reloaded there's a lot more to Revolutions than directly meets the eye.<br/><br/>I must say the action sequences were spectacular, even if they were a sort of Terminator-meets-Rambo style action and not necessarily the wondrous techniques of bullet-time (et al.) developed in the first and barely used in the second.  However, I'll admit to being initially somewhat disappointed with the second movie until getting it on DVD and watching it enough to notice the incredibly subtle philosophical fabric that mirrors our own lives.  The third movie emphasizes this, and raises such questions as ""what is consciousness?"" and ""what is OUR purpose?"".  Realize that the issues presented in the movie are presented with nearly a human-only viewpoint, leaving us to wonder what possibly the machines felt about all of this. Without getting into any debates on those issues, I feel an underlying theme of the last two movies is that if you think you know the answer to such questions, think again.<br/><br/>The characters were still great, and the action was still incredible.  I felt it had quite a bit of story, so I'm not quite certain what so many people missed out on.  Well, perhaps if you are not at all a philosophical person, you may be disappointed.  Otherwise ENJOY IT and take it for what it's worth!!  Don't go with expectations, as that will always let you down.<br/><br/>
WARNING: The rest contains some SPOILERS, so DO NOT read on if you haven't seen it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
But take it for what it's worth: the first movie gave us an awesome intro, the second a gateway step into the evolution of The One and the third the finality of Neo's true purpose, with an epic battle as the humans fight for their lives.  Yes, they present Neo in a sort of divinity in the end, but then what else is a sacrifice of one's own life to save both the humans AND the machines?  Could this have ended another way? No, I don't think so...not without leaving other's of us disappointed and jaded with the familiar Hollywood happy-ending of everyone lives and everyone is friends again.  I think many of us figured that Neo would have to die before it was all over.<br/><br/>I find it very interesting how the brothers also chose to explore facets such as ""love"" and how the programs and humans were not so different after all.  Greed, power, faith...they're all there.  Perhaps the deepest philosophical ideal is Neo's fight with ""himself,"" and his realization that he must become one with his opposite in order to defeat Smith.  This reinforced the ideal of balance they presented, part of their woven philosophy.<br/><br/>I don't believe it's necessarily right to compare the first Matrix with Reloaded and Revolutions.  The first movie was revolutionary in both depth and action.  Concerned about plot?  Looking back on the first one, it actually didn't have much more than the second or third one.  It was new and unique, that's what made it great.  Reloaded and Revolutions are addendums, the last two pieces of the puzzle that make the image complete.  They present a far deeper philosophy, and in their own rights I feel are equally as awesome as the first.  It was truly worth watching, and I'm looking forward to seeing it again."

","I am not saying this is a great film, it is a great film to go and watch. I liked the action in the movie and the plot twist at the end.  However this film shared the subpar acting that the second film also had, but not to the extent of the second film (worse acting in second than the third). Compared to other films out this year such as the Hulk and what not, this is a quality film and worthy of going to the movie to see.  It does not live up the jaw-dropping experience of the first film.  Living up to the first film would have cost too much and taken too long to do, people were expecting too much out of the second and third films.  However being a Matrix fan I am biased towards liking all three films.  No matter what people say about this film it is a quality work of art, not the best work of art, but it still has quality to it.  I think the Matrix Trilogy will become a cult classic and if George Lucas keeps ruining Star Wars, might even take over as one of the best trilogies."

As others have, I will not reveal anything about the plot except this:  there are more holes in this movie than bad swiss cheese.  I felt nothing that was left unanswered in ""Reloaded"" was answered, and more question were posed, and these questions were not answered either.  Visual effects in this movie were simply astounding, the best part of the film.  But the constant action of the first movie was absent.  The dialogue was more slop from ""Reloaded,"" big phrases using big words that made no sense and were not essential to plot development.  I wanted my money back after watching this excuse for a conclusion to what started as an interesting and well-developed storyline."

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>Well, and so it ends. One of the most extraordinary movies of the 90's spawned a saga of biblical proportions, with concepts and CGI to feast the eyes in a never-before-seen way. And now, it's all over. What lies on the aftermath?<br/><br/>Well, unfortunately, not a life-changing experience. When the whole world saw Neo dodging bullets, when everyone was presented with the notion of reality being just a simulation, when the concept of alternate reality even became part of philosophical studies, the prospect of two further movies was mouth-watering: more action, more flo- mo, and also more mind-bending notions and concepts. Unfortunately, when ""Reloaded"" came out, the feeling was a little bit hollow: the concepts and the wonder of the first movie almost disappeared under the weight of the colossal CGI machine. And the ending was non-existent: it would all be concluded in the next and final chapter. But when you finish seeing it, it almost impossible not to think if there won't be mor e movies: the overall feeling was simply - ""I want more explanations"". Because it is sad to see that the Arquitect's speech in ""Reloaded"" is more puzzling than all of the spiritual and philosophical questions of ""Revolutions"" combined. The problem is simple: the movie that should provide more answers, the movie that should clear us all about everything, is actually a movie that seldomly stops to dwell. This gives way to another bombastic spectacle of special effects, which, among all fireworks, manages not to be as chilling or inventive as the previous feature. And that's the main problem  with ""Revolutions"" - a movie that spends most of its time in the ""real"" world will never have the enchantment that made us love the ""virtual"" world in the first place. It sometimes feels like a crossing between ""Alien3"" and ""Mad Max"" underground. By the time someone re-enters the Matrix again, you will miss the good old times when it was all about kung fu, expert shooting and a breakneck soundtrack. How much you enjoy this, is much up to you, but as slaving and unforgiving the virtual world of the Matrix is, by the end you will feel the need to get plugged in again."

"jmp1024","9","0","0","6 November 2003"," Not what you expected
","If you go to see Revolutions expecting to have the world tied up in a nice little package with all your questions answered, you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Overall, Revolutions neatly ties up the major open issues from the first two movies while leaving many questions wide open (if not more open than before). Oddly enough, you are still left with the original question that Neo was searching for: What IS the matrix? At the same time, the war between man and machine is resolved as foreshadowed by the Oracle in Reloaded - but not exactly how you would expect.<br/><br/>The trilogy as a whole took some huge chances, and for the most part, they paid off handsomely. The story could have been slightly tighter and the editing a bit closer - some scenes were just flat out too long. But the score and the effects were beyond incredible and into the 'groundbreaking' category.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, Tanveer Atwal made a very memorable film debut as Sati, and Ian Bliss as Bane was simply wonderful. Nathaniel Lees and Clayton Watson (Mifume and Kid) had some amazingly good moments as well. The original cast did well in reprising their roles. I believe that finally, Keanu Reeves nailed the part of Neo, riding the thin line between being a man and a super-hero and accepting his destiny. Hugo Weaving as Smith was outstanding, and the final acting in his last sequence is simply amazing (and amusing) to watch.<br/><br/>The story, overall, is genius. Making the most advanced motion picture ever devised with one of the oldest plot resolution devices ever conceived is the mark of sheer genius, although it will probably be panned as an 'unoriginal' idea instead of the ironic (and unexpected) twist it is.<br/><br/>You can meet me at the train station.

","I am not going to get caught up in the numerous plot holes or why this film is such a sour ending(after the promised of the Matrix) to  a spectacular and original sci-fi trilogy. The dialogue was bland, there were no real character developments to speak of and the main battle sequence at the dock was fatiguing to watch! Yes - the door is open for more films but unless people put their backsides to seats, I will be surprised if anyone in Hollywood will have the balls to give the Wachowski brothers a big budget to blow again!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will leave the detail of this film out because I don't want to give away the story to people who haven't already seen it.<br/><br/>Poor focus in the story telling ultimately makes for a slightly dis-jointed film. The film's underlying theme seems to be somewhat religious: faith, trust, belief and sacrifice.

","{SPOILERS}<br/><br/>
I think the fairest way of summing up Reloaded is to imagine director Andy Wachowski sitting down in an empty theatre to watch the first running of the completed Revolutions. Two hours pass. The credits roll. Andy thinks ""Um ... it was better in my head.""<br/><br/>Revolutions disappoints. It doesn't deserve a manic slagging off like some comments are doing, but what is does deserve is a few kicks up the backside for screwing up the chance to create the most memorable movie of the decade. The first cracks appeared as the reverse-gravity fight broke out outside the S+M bar. I remember thinking - Guns. Pillars. Acrobatics. What could be more embarrassing than the Wachowskis ripping off their own movie? Failing at it, that's what. They could have done so much with this scene, but it falls over itself in a heap of gunfire, bodies and techno beats in exactly the opposite way that the pillar fight in the first Matrix succeeded. I've seen video games that exploit bi-directional gravity so much better - anyone remember the mindblowing Aztec levels from Serious Sam?<br/><br/>Then they talk to the Merovingian (sp?) His face is there, his charisma is there, his accent is there, and yet someone seems to have taken his script away. All his delightful wordplay from Reloaded is gone, and he says something along the lines of 'Blah blah I am totally irrelevant in this movie and I think the audience are working this out too. Get me the Oracles' eyes.' Trinity: 'No.' Merovingian: 'Oh sod this, here's Neo, now get out my bar.' Also, I was surprised to see Persephone back by his side. Wasn't this the woman that betrayed you and nearly killed you in Reloaded? At least put her in handcuffs or something. There's plenty of them around. Then we get the embarrassing Mexican standoff which is very silly indeed, and making the people wear Gimp suits didn't exactly highten the drama.<br/><br/>Most of the film concentrates on the battle for Zion. And here's the problem - we don't care. Because the sides are using such silly weaponry and tactics, it's very difficult to take the drama seriously. For example - the mechanical frames that the soldiers strap onto. Who designed them so the cockpit would be left completely open and the pilot completely exposed? And the Sentinel's tactics aren't much better either. They swarm around in these incredibly tight masses. I remember thinking - A simple World War II flak cannon could make a hundred thousand kills in about three minutes against this lot. Of course, movie buffs could counter this argument by saying Well it's Hollywood isn't it and it's all dramatic licence. True, but I'd imagine as the suffering people of Zion scraped the remains of some poor sucker out of his robot suit they'd think We really, really should have put more thought into this. The battle for Zion descends into a sort of rendering exercise for the CGI programs involved.<br/><br/>What really hurts, though, is the ending. Neo makes a deal with the Matrix where he will defeat Smith and the humans will be left in peace. Instantly, the audience thinks - Where's my guarantee? Before long Neo is indeed fighting Smith, and is defeated. Smith says something like 'Surely your social etiquette and whatnot is just as complex and constrictive as the Matrix itself.' That was truly insulting to the audience to suggest what the Matrix trilogy was supposed to be all 'about' in a metaphorical way. Social etiquette?<br/><br/>Anyway, Neo is defeated and Smith tries to assimilate him, but it turns out that Neo is some sort of booby trap and Smith explodes. The film ends with the Architect and the Oracle finalising the truce. That, dear sirs, is when I ran out of patience. So all of the trilogy was just a game played between the A and the O and no-one had any choice or any chance of making a difference. How can I enjoy the first two films again knowing that? Of course war will break out again between the humans and the matrix, as the peace is not what a stable equilibrium, with neither side getting what they want.<br/><br/>Nobody likes to be jerked off and confused like this in a movie, and if you wanted to be clever then sorry Misters Wachowski but you have succeeded in coming across as antisocial and incompetent."

","Upon walking out of the first Matrix...my thoughts were overwhelmed with joy...the joy of having seen a great film, a classic sci-fi.  Watching it over the years, the great philosophy behind the movie still stands strong. But, the first film was really pretty simple...and I think fooled a lot of people into believing they had seen something else...The basic summary, here,...Neo is freed, believed to be the one, trained, tested, and well...the whole concept is just getting back out of the Matrix, once visiting the Oracle.  But, the story was set for us.  The reason the ONE was important, was because Humans are the ""batteries"" for the machines...and the ONE will help free us from the machines.  Neo proves to be the ONE and he flys at the end...we liked it then but,......<br/><br/>......The infamous Reloaded....Everyone hated it....why?  Granted, I walked out the first time more dissapointed then ever...but, in hindsight I realized that it only continued as it could.  The REAL world is at threat from the machines because, ZION(mentioned, and slightly shown, in the first)is the REAL world for REAL humans.  That's the real plot of the first movie....it's just told through NEO's life....He's the ONE (born as the one, if you will, in the first).  Reloaded, he continues as the one...spreading hope to everyone in ZION...and Neo's journey of understanding what he has to do with his new responsibility...hence, all the dialouge in the second movie.  In the meantime, you have Zion still being threatened by the loads of sentinels on their way to the walls of Zion.  What do you expect to happen next?  Upon viewing the film for the third or fourth time...I really began to understand that the ideas of all three films, basically, is that ZION is at stake and NEO is the ONE to save them all....maybe....maybe...I really liked this film, it requires extra viewings.<br/><br/>....REVOLUTIONS...sure, lots of war...it took up most of the film but, although I'd rather have seen less CGI fighting....What else should I have expected?  The sentinels were already at the walls of Zion at the end of the second film....ships were already destroyed....Neo found a strange new power....and Smith had entered the REAL world.  The movie begins EXACTLY where it left off.  Sentinels breaching the walls of ZION...it explains what's wrong with NEO....the ship's captains make decisions....NEO goes his way(what else is supposed to happen?I can't think of anything else)...the other ship goes back to aid a near destroyed ZION....and NEO does what he thinks is best to save ZION.  But, the major plot here...is ZION IS AT WAR, THE REAL WORLD IS REALLY AT STAKE HERE!  NOT, NEO was soooo cooool in the first film but, NEO IS THE ONLY HOPE, WE ARE SUFFERING.  Sure, Neo doesn't show up a lot in this film but, he shows up for what he's needed for. Overall I believe that the Wachowski's did what had to be done...and revolved the film around lots of intelligent and emotional themes....what is the matrix?, do we exist, why?, cause and effect, love, emotion, computer programs...etc.  The first film ended with an opening for such a story...it could not have been told any other way...the film is years ahead of it's time in animation, stunts, action, philosophy, thematic plot...(although the dialouge writing is very weak)...I give this movie...I'm judging all three as one...a 8.0 out of 10.0.  Maybe, we loved the first film soooo much, we expect too much....maybe people were too confused with the second film....maybe we really don't like sci-fi movies....but, I can't think of many movies that surpass this movie...sure there are some but, not many. That puts this trilogy high on the list.  I'm not going to bash it because it didn't meet MY PERSONAL expectations."

","The Matrix - brilliant film with incredible story line, FX and action. Reloaded was tolerated because of the FX and action - the plot getting subverted to spiritual babble with only a few glimpses of the original techie idea of The Matrix.   With Revolutions the Wachowski brothers have descended into a pit of cheese and drowned the original concept in moralistic claptrap.  It seems that the person who came up with the idea for Matrix left the building and the god squad took over. Apart from Hugo Weaving (Ag. Smith), some ass-kicking from Niobi & Trinity, the rest was nausea-inducing.  The acting was so wooden in Reloaded, that I really thought Revolutions would end with Neo back at his PC at home, having completed the game ""Save Zion"", which begun with him following the white rabbit - remember.  All that business about choice and guides etc. - a computer game - thereby excusing the ham acting and badly scripted dialogue and long winded speeches going nowhere - this was a film about computers/technology after all.  We are in the 21st century - Hollywood has done all the biblical epics we need, why couldn't they leave this one (the Matrix) alone.  Is Hollywood so in need of yet another saviour - what a choice - remember Neo was a hacker! Revolutions came very very close to reminding me of another 'save the world' film with wooden acting - Rambo, saved only by Agent Smith, who for me had the best lines and who's character was not compromised by the ridiculous plot.  I thought the Wachowski brothers were more intelligent."

","This is the most reluctant seven I think I could ever give. The screen play is worth a two, the technical achievements of the movie our worth a ten so the average comes up to a six. I entered seven on the rating but I'll see if can change that. While I comment on this movie it is impossible to talk about this movie without talking about the second Reloaded since they feel like just one movie split into two.<br/><br/>Revolutions has some of the most amazing special effects ever made and good performances (with lousy dialog). It also doesn't have the embarrassing rave/sex scene in the second movie.<br/><br/>However, it suffers from poor dialog and spending too much time in Zion (a place dreary at best). The dialog seems mostly to be reiterations from the second movie. Unlike others I don't see that free choice is a bad idea concept of basing the movie on, but it never gives a good idealogical reason why free choice is important.<br/><br/>The problem of the movie still relates to the dreary design of Zion. Words do mean things and Zion is the mount to where the Temple of Jerusalem was placed; the word Zion also is often used for the Jerusalem and Israel itself. With the technology at their disposal why couldn't Zion seem something like Hobbiton: a true alternative to the dreary Matrix skyscraper world and reality of how the earth now exists. Instead we are given a world that seems inferior the skyscraper construct of the Matrix and makes us think that Cypher's choice in the first movie wasn't illogical while highly immoral.<br/><br/>The two Matrix sequels seem to be afterthoughts. Instead of thinking about a world that most people would want to save (Zion) we instead are fed the most basic sort of philosophical ideas and excellent special effects. Characters are given limitations (Oracle and Neo) that seem to just be created so give us a chance to have sequels, not to improve the story. Does anyone think that Neo would seem to be as super-powered as he was if there were a sequel intended?<br/><br/>What the creators of the Matrix don't realize is that people fight for what is behind them: their families, friends, towns and country, not what is in front of them. The first Matrix movie could get away from this because we could imagine Zion as a wonderful place. However its reality makes it a much difficult to imagine people wanting to fight for it. There is a scene in this movie where we are drawn into Merovingian's club which seems amazing like the rave scene from Reloaded and you wonder: why do I think that these are the villains and the citizens of Zion as the heroes?<br/><br/>A sequel (and there are few) has to give good reasons to why there is  a sequel. Aliens dealt with the problem of all those eggs left on the surface of the planet we saw in Alien. The Godfather II let us see what made Corlone into the monster that we saw in Godfather I. There is no reason that the resolution given in this movie is superior to the original resolution in the original Matrix and that is what makes this movie sad: for it has reduced the importance of the ending of the one of the best sci-fi movies of all time, The Matrix."

","This 3rd installment is horrible. **spoilers below** Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of the Matrix genre, watching the first 2 films of the series multiple times, reading newsgroups articles on the meaning of films and speculation on what will happen.  This film was a huge letdown for me because it failed to answer many questions from the first two films adequatly and really give an ending to the series. We see Trinty's Death as meaningless as a car acident, characters such as the trainman?? and the seraph, and little indian girl pop in and out of the film with no real purpose or definitive storyline and we get the ending where Neo forgets the matrix is a program and dies. As stated by other critics, the film borrows ideas from several films such as aliens (rebel robot suit), attack of the clones (the sentintels), robocop (half man/half machine), starship warriors and even the english patient. (trinty's very long death scence). I was looking for a unique film as the 1st and 2nd installments gave us, but we end up with an x-files type explanation for the geniously created plot with a sci-fi channel movie ending.

And I'm not even talking about the visual effects that were superb :-)<br/><br/>And this is what he second movie and even more the third one lacks : a solid storyline. I have indeed the feeling that the spirit of the first movie has gone away and that there is only one thing left to make the movie interesting : plenty and plenty of special effects and awesome action. But even the best special effects and the best action becomes boring when there is nothing behind.<br/><br/>
To all those that have seen the movie, take time to ask yourself the following question : `How many scenes in this movie are completely useless and do not bring nothing to the story ?' This is at least the question I asked myself when the film was finished. Think about the first Matrix and you'll understand the reason why I asked myself this question : nearly every scene in the original Matrix had a sense, which is sadly not the case for the two others.<br/><br/>Add to this some dialogs about pseudo-philosophical stuff that were completely ridiculous and there is only one thing left in this movie : the action.<br/><br/>Good action but no story, too many characters that are not developed (and you just wonder WHY they are in the movie ?), too many scenes that you ask yourself, when the movie is finished, why they were there, what was their sense or what was the goal to have them there, and you'll understand why I rated this film with 5.<br/><br/>It could have been a 6 but I was way too much disappointed :-)"

But then, after about 10 or 20 minutes, it heated up with a couple of good scenes. These were both homages to scenes in the original Matrix - a fight in an underground station and a blantant rip off of the lobby scene.<br/><br/>Then it got a bit talky again, whilst they all discussed what to do, but then...  The big battle sequence for Zion happened, and restored your faith in this franchise.  This seqeunce is worth the price of admission alone, even if it did get a bit confusing due to all the minor characters that had been introduced in the last film having bit parts and roles to play, and you couldn't remember who was whom.  Great homage to Alien, and also to Aliens [marines fighting against interminable odds] and Star Wars [an obvious plot point and a couple of very subtle references].  Oh, and Neo wasn't in the film for 20 minutes, which meant that you had people who could portray more than one emotion on screen.  Even Morpheus became more human during this sequence.<br/><br/>Then there's the final ending to the film, which I won't give away.  But I will say it was a bit of a cop out - Matrix the TV series anyone?<br/><br/>Oh, and the battle between Neo and Smith [well, one of the Smiths anyway, and I don't mean Morrissey] was a little dark and hard to tell what was going in in some places."

"johnnyb1973","10","0","0","6 November 2003"," Spiritual, magestic, and all wrapped up.
","First thing I'd like to say is that anyone who says this movie is plotless, or has no direction, or just completely didn't like it because it's not like the first one really didn't understand the movie.  If the brother's wanted to make a movie just like the first one, it wouldn't be a sequel, would it?<br/><br/>
***Possible Spoilers to follow****<br/><br/>Now, I loved this movie because it makes you think.  It's a movie that makes you think about it for a long time after you leave the theater.  I guess some people don't like that, they want it all spelled out for them, which is done very nicely in the first movie.  The second two actually make you think.  They are more spiritual, and existential.  I was very impressed with the death scene.  There was an actual emotional connection, and maybe it's because Keanu's eyes are covered, who knows, I beleived it.  I noticed most complaints are because things aren't spelled out for them.  The ending of this movie lets you think about what happens next.  I felt that the machines carried 'The One' away, almost ceremoniously.  It took a little while before I realized that Smith had copied EVERYONE.  The last exile did have a purpose, and she made the purpose clear in the end.  I thought it to be a fantastic plot twist for Neo to fight for everyone, the programs which he knew 'felt' emotions now, the machines who didn't want to die, and all the humans.  As it ended, I felt very satisfied.  It was over.  No, they don't wrap things up good and tidy and explain what happens after it's all over, but who cares. I have a real problem with the people who didn't like the movie because the plot didn't follow the direction they thought it should go.  You didn't write the movie, you didn't make the movie, someone else did, so take it as they wrote it.  When you're done watching the movie that these artists created, go write your own version, and get it made.  Sorry you didn't like it.  I was beleiving in the 'two matrix' theory after the second movie too. But that is completely cleaned up by Neo and The Oracle.  If you missed that part of the movie, you should go see it again.  I though all of the questions were answered very well.  Neo isn't only the 'anomaly' he's actually the ONE, the one that brings it all together.  Very spritual and almost evolutionary. I guess if you don't feel like thinking, don't go see this.  If you're easily confused, you're probably not going to like it, just see it again, or buy the DVD, one day, it may come to you.  It's obviously not your purpose."
"TJ1380","Null","0","0","6 November 2003"," A fitting final chapter
","""The Matrix: Revolutions"" is a fitting final chapter to the ""Matrix"" trilogy.  It ties up most of the loose ends of the first two movies (it doesn't answer all the questions, but I think this was intentional), and brings it to a logical conclusion.  There is one major flaw that I found difficult to overlook: although I sat through the entire movie, the almost complete lack of an exposition made it feel like walking into a movie that was almost over.  While anyone could argue that the final two films of the trilogy are really one long film, if I'm going to pay full price for a movie, I want to see more than the third act.<br/><br/>That's not to say that I didn't enjoy the movie.  There are some beautiful action scenes and cinematography (particularly the lobby shootout towards the beginning of the film, and the final battle for the fate of the matrix). I also found myself actually caring about the citizens of Zion.  They're up against nearly impossible odds, and they all know it; it's clear that they aren't preparing for battle as much as they are preparing to die.  Also, I felt that the ending was very appropriate (even though people seem to disagree).  It brought the story to a logical conclusion, yet left the door open for other possibilities.  I don't think we'll see a sequel, but I think it will give fans something to talk about.<br/><br/>Overall, I have to say that I did enjoy this movie as a final chapter to the ""Matrix"" trilogy, but it feels too much like a final chapter to stand on its own.  I recommend watching the first two movies the day before seeing this one, and keep in mind that it is just an ending and not much else."
"chessmartin","10","0","0","6 November 2003"," More tension and warmth than its predecessor. A solid finish to the trilogy.
","First, let's get this out of the way...the critics are dead wrong about this film.  In fact, I suspect that many of them had their clever digs at the movie written long before they even saw it.  When I read things like ""whoah-fully inadequate"", my eyes just roll, because I know it's more about the power of the critic to tear down and to seem clever than it is an honest assessment of a film.<br/><br/>That said, Revolutions is not perfect.  I recall sighing once or twice at a cheesy bit of dialogue, and there was even one unintentional laugh from the audience at a character's completely inappropriate response of ""I'll be alright,"" when he's obviously NOT alright.  Though in retrospect, I suppose it was a reference to a character in the first film who said the same thing. I was also a bit disappointed that some of the key setups in Reloaded (Merovingian, counselman, prior ""ones"") were not pursued in Revolutions. Minor flaws notwithstanding, this is a very good action movie that simply requires a bit of audience participation.<br/><br/>Many people didn't like Reloaded, and I completely understand why they wouldn't.  Because it took place largely within the Matrix, was cold and lacked tension.  It felt like one over the top action/fight scene after another with a minimum of real human interaction.  Unfortunately the editors noticed and tried to compensate with that dreadful rave scene.  There was also a complete lack of tension in that you never had the impression that the characters were in any real danger.  The mistake, I think, was in the failure to cut back to the characters' real world bodies every now and then to show that they were taking some damage.  Reloaded was a bit cold, generally lacked tension, and the ending was clear as mud, but I still enjoyed it as a hell of a ride with the story taking some interesting directions.  The question is ""does revolutions have the same flaws?""<br/><br/>Fortunately, Revolutions takes place in the real world with real people in real danger, and the tension is cranked up several times with generally satisfying payoffs.  While there was still a lack of chemistry between Neo and Trinity, they are certainly more believable as a couple in Revolutions than in either previous film.  Because this movie is about the ""real"" world and not the matrix, those expecting an abundance of gunplay and kung-fu will be disappointed.  This is a sci-fi action movie in the vein of Aliens, and is much more straightforward than Reloaded.<br/><br/>Those expecting to see a solid closing, great action, and stunning visuals will not be disappointed...period.<br/><br/>So there you have it, not perfect but not nearly as bad as advertised. This trilogy will stand the test of time and the final installment should be seen in the theater if you even remotely enjoyed either of the first two.<br/><br/>Matrix: 10 Reloaded: 7 Revolutions: 9"

They are also about how strong the will to survive is inside of us, and that no matter what happens the human race will never give up fighting for their freedom. The action sequences in this movie will blow your mind, they are done very well and it makes for a very suspenseful movie. I give this movie nine out of ten stars.

"Corsten","9","0","0","6 November 2003"," Make no mistake, Revolutions is different enough from earlier chapters in this sci-fi saga
","Firstly: I rate highly the original ""Matrix"", and overall, though a weaker film, I enjoyed ""Matrix Reloaded"" a fair bit in the end. But, I went into Reloaded with high expectations, that, sadly, were not met in many places. Thus, naturally, my expectations for ""Matrix Revolutions"" were somewhat more subdued.<br/><br/>Well: I'm happy to say that in all, Revolutions pleasantly surprised me, and I enjoyed it more than I expected to.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS** (you have been warned!!)<br/><br/>To me, Revolutions stands out as the superior sequel, for two simple but very important reasons. Firstly, and more than once, I was on the edge of my seat in anticipation as to what was about to happen. When Seraph was leading the young girl away from the Smiths after having seen the Oracle, I was genuinely concerned for their safety. This was the first time I felt afraid of Smith. Reloaded never kept me in that kind of suspense. The trouble with that film on this basis is that you never sensed that the main characters were in any real danger - Neo was invincible, and the villains seemed to lack what it takes to overcome the 'goodies'. This time, the stakes were so much higher - we saw, as the film unfolded at a pleasant pace (not too fast, never dragging either) some recognisable characters killed off - more blood too - and above all, we saw some payback as to what happens when the villains encountered the heroes. And thus, there was a real possibility that our heroes were in danger, and that, yes - they could actually die.<br/><br/>**SERIOUSLY, MAJOR SPOILERS ALERT NOW**<br/><br/>Secondly, and more importantly, this time we actually cared for the main characters - something that not even the original film managed to pull off. When the commander general guy was slugging it out in his robo-machine, and was eventually overcome, his death invoked a certain feeling of sadness. And more surprisingly to me, as someone never a fan of Trinity, when she died, I was rather moved. That particular scene (fresh from the beautiful scene where she and Neo - for the first time in their 'real' lives, saw the sun once they flew above the clouds) was handled very well - perhaps one of the finest throughout the entire trilogy. The score was wonderful, and the script wasn't overly cheesy. Also, and this is the real shock - Neo's grief was actually well-acted in my opinion, which, given the fact that Reeves is as wooden as actors come, was something of an achievement for him. I for one had a lump in my throat as the blind Neo finally became aware that his beloved Trinity was skewered and was slipping away before his very eyes, and all the while he was powerless to stop it.<br/><br/>Moving on - the set pieces. The battle for Zion was great - not too long (as was the very real danger - that car chase in Relaoded was overly long) and full of moments where you winced, where you really rooted for the heroes, and where - yes - you truly were on the side of the good guys. This kind of action sequence has eluded the directors thus far - Neo was never in any real danger in the Burly Brawl in Reloaded, was he? In fact this sequence was reminiscent of the old Star Wars battles in space (a good thing). I guess one could sum this up as suspense, and as demonstrated blindingly well in the scene were Neo blindly fought Bane onboard the Osiris(?), this film managed to actually have some. Visually, the battle (for Zion) was great, and overall, the effects in general were miles ahead of either prequels. They seemed more polished, less rushed, and the CG is FAR better disguised.<br/><br/>The other main action sequence was of course the final showdown between Smith and Neo. The dark brooding menace of the setting, and the heavy rainfall made for great cinema and underpinned by the beefier, more operatic score, was a real treat to watch. Having made the risky decision to power-up Smith, at least this time round Neo actually had to fight, and in the end, whereas he took on a hundred Smiths before and come out on top, this time he was out-punched by just one. Marvelous stuff - well choreographed, beautifully shot, and above all - epic.<br/><br/>And I think that is it - this final installment was more epic than either of the other two, and it's epic that one demands with such a film.<br/><br/>Performance wise, no Matrix film is ever going to get Best Acting nods, but the acting certainly wasn't any worse than either prequels, and Weaving, as the deliciously malevolent Smith, was on top form again, outshining his contempories by light years. Though I must add, Smith as a character, whilst more menacing this time round, wasn't nearly as witty as in other outings.<br/><br/>I missed the Key Maker (he was very likeable) and I missed the original Oracle - Gloria Foster (R.I.P.) was far more likeable than her replacement in this film, and this is something Revolutions pays for when compared to its sequilian brothers.<br/><br/>As for the ending - well, I'll leave that up to you to take from it what you will and make up your own mind - as intended by the Brothers Wachowski, but whilst it didn't blow me away, I (was seemingly in the minority when I say I) wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>So, in brief, what does Revolutions have going for it? Greater sense of 'epic', a more triumphant score, some real suspense, thankfully some more screen time for the love-to-hate Merovingian, less post-modern philosophy, some visually pretty action sequences (the sentinels looked far more effective this time - as I said, the 'CG-ness' was better disguised) and a genuinely gripping storyline that on the whole was never predictable, and kept you guessing what was coming next.<br/><br/>Coupled with the 'beauty shots' - ie, the first real sighting of the sun for Neo and Trinity, and the sprawling juggernaught that was the Machine City, this film seemed like it really is the final showdown. It was a shame that our heroes spent less time in the Matrix - but then, how the critics would have scorned a replica of the earlier Matrices. We've seen the digital heroes, this film's purpose was to make Matrix history and showcase the real-life heroes, in the real world.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, Revolutions is different enough from earlier chapters in this sci-fi saga, and though by no means flawless, it was in my opinion a fitting end to the three-part saga, and above all, was more human than Reloaded. We cared for the characters as they struggled, we felt for them as they died, and we were behind them all the way. Something that can't be said for much of Reloaded and even some of the original.<br/><br/>In all, it doesn't live up to the original, but it surpasses Reloaded, and if you've seen those two, don't be a fool and miss this one.<br/><br/>You wouldn't want the Matrix to still have you, now would you?!"
"xanyk","Null","0","0","6 November 2003"," It won't please everyone, but the anime & comic book fans should be happy.
","(Minor spoilers - nothing that wasn't in the trailers)<br/><br/>The Matrix trilogy is such a massive hybrid of film genres, but more importantly it has drawn on different ones for each part.  The overall enabling concept is science fiction for all three; the first adds HK wire-fu and gangster guns to that; the second adds a james-bond-like mission complete with car chase; the third goes into fantasy epic territory as well as the high-power superheroics that started in part 2.<br/><br/>My main gripe is with the amount of very grave dialogue that surrounds the battle scenes.  It all seems very out of place, but i couldn't really pick exactly why at first.  After seeing the movie again at the opening I realised why this dialogue kept reminding me of Star Wars or even LOTR - the characters were all speaking that kind of heightened, melodramatic dialogue that you're only used to hearing in high fantasy or old comic books. Having met these characters in the (ironically) more 'realist' world of the matrix, it's a bit off-putting.  Cheese tastes better when you're expecting it.<br/><br/>So my main advice to anyone who hasn't seen this film is to watch at least Reloaded immediately beforehand and to remember that from the end of the first Matrix there was every indication that this story was borne out of a love for superhero comics and anime.  The parallels between Revolutions and Neon Genesis Evangelion are many - armageddon and battle-mechs in both! The Superman as Jesus thing is brought to its logical conclusion here.  As far as movie trilogies, think Return of the Jedi with a more ambiguous ending and no Ewoks (that should be recommendation enough!).  It's also the first time we've seen a big mech battle in live action as well as topping Superman for the old-school superhero battle.<br/><br/>My only other criticism is how Christian it gets by the end.  There is an attempt to incorporate Hindu religion early on, but the Eastern influence seems a bit left out by the end.  That said, they did an amazing job trying to incorporate several thousand years of philosophy from around the world into one big metaphorical construct.  But when you're doing armageddon, that's the realm of religion not philosophy.<br/><br/>Any of you people who complain about brainless Hollywood action movies start whinging about ""all that boring talking"" in the Matrix trilogy should be condemned to the hell of the endless Devlin/Emmerich film festival."

","The Matrix Trilogy has come to an end I must say that this doesn't really go down with a bang, but the film hasn't dissapointed me that much. As Reloaded mainly took place within the Matrix, Revolutions mainly takes place outside of the Matrix into Zion. What this film is about is basically picked up from where Reloaded ended. <br/><br/>The film may not be very original because it's not and never attempts to be original and therefore what your left is a whole of mess of information to absorb in this film, because it's quite complicated to understand if you haven't seen any of the first two Matrix movies. But saying that that the Wachowski Brothers have managed to just a bit to succeed into making a very enjoyable film that completes a well done trilogy that started way back in 1999. <br/><br/>But this film doesn't end in a big way as you may expect to find in a trilogy, however the special effects are amazing, okay you may find me saying that a lot in my previous reviews, but the effects are definately that amazing and all of the hard work into making this film is done brilliantly!

"eljambon","Null","0","0","6 November 2003"," Why?
","Why do we have to make sequels? Some things are better left to the imagination such as any possible sequel to the matrix. The first film as we all know ended with our good friend Keenu realizing he is the one and we assume he will one day save the human race from those evil machines. Here lies the problem for we have nothing but our imagination to keep us concerned about the film. Once we lose this we are ultimately dissapointed. The first sequel was entertaining, every fight scene in and of itself was a work of art and this I believe is what orginally captivated so many individuals. In the end no one really gave a s#!+ about Zion, everyone just wanted to see more Kung-Fu. Nevertheless it explained things in such a way, as clever as it may me, that we either expect more or something completely different. As interesting as plot twists maybe, they are nothing more than a Hollywood gimick to keep the film going or make way for potential sequels assuming the movie makes enough crunch. Now as much as the first sequel may have killed some of our imagination it left us pondering how it would end. Now we come to the third movie which really shouldn't have been made(I'm well aware that they are technically one movie). The problem again is the way the plot unfolds if this is the end, there has to be one motherF^@*!ng showdown and again who cares about Zion? Give us more Kung-Fu! As well as that war sequence was done, it was nothing more than big dumb mindless action and when compared to even the smallest fight scene pales in comparison. Too much of this film took place outside the Matrix and that is it's greatest weakness becuase when things have to obey natural they must remain realistic. Finally after all that nonsense we're left waiting for Neo's showdown with Smith and agian as well as it was done could be nothing but upsetting. I won't talk about the ending because the way it ended there is nothing to talk about just another twist which will give us another sequel assuming they get happy box office numbers, ultimately eroding further the qualities which made the first movie good."

","First off, I loved all three of the Matrix films and I am saddened that the `Matrix events' are over.  However, I do have hope that there will be more sequels.  I base this hope on Neo's final scene and the concluding dialog between the Architect and Oracle. ************ SPOILERS****************************** Basically if you read between the lines, you will see the set up for the next movie and the key is human nature. Years will pass and if the humans are left unchecked, they will become discontented with their existence underground. Of course the human population will grow. A charismatic leader could generate resentment towards the machines by simply stating that the Earth belongs to mankind and why should mankind share the Earth with machines.  This is why the Architect stated to the Oracle that she was playing a dangerous game. Machines are unemotional and will keep their agreement of the truce. Humans on the other hand will betray anyone or anything in a heartbeat.  In the Animatrix, this is how the human/machine conflict started in the first place. Mankind wanted to destroy or isolate all machines. The same emotions will arise again in the human.  With enough time, the humans could develop weapons that could severely threaten the existence of the surface machines. I believe that a script could be written that will explain the resurrection of Neo   The machines transferred Neo's `soul' just before Smith absorbed him and then stored it.  Neo's body was placed in suspended animation for years and the machines decide to resurrect Neo in order to stop an imminent human threat and maintain the peace"

","the conclusion to the matrix trilogy seems to be more of a cliffhanger than the end of Reloaded.  while the end of Reloaded was a dramatic high point, sort of a commercial break in the middle of a TV movie, the end of Revolutions left a feeling ""where do we go from here"" that one gets from an end of a chapter in a book.  there never is a conclusive ending to the question of the machine war.  there was more talking than action in this one compared to the other two, and while i loved the philosophical arguments in the other two, there isn't much philosophy in the dialogue in the third one.<br/><br/>the movie bunked in places that it should have rocked.  the ending left way too many questions, not only unanswered, but unasked as well."
"kiron-1","Null","0","0","6 November 2003"," They should have stopped after the first Matrix movie...
","After I was let down by Reloaded, I knew ahead of time not to get my hopes up for Revolutions.  I'm glad I didn't.  Not only did this movie not answer most of the questions Reloaded presented us, but it added it's own unexplained and often nonsensical questions.  If you are looking to see a movie for stunning visual effects or purely for actions scenes that will get your adrenaline pumping, Revolutions is the way to go.  But I also enjoy the STORY of a movie from time to time, and Revolutions failed to deliver.<br/><br/>***MAJOR SPOILERS***<br/><br/>***YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED***<br/><br/>Here are the problems I had with the movie (in no particular order at all). Please, if anyone can answer these, please do as it may help me enjoy the movie more if some of my questions are answered.<br/><br/>1) They never explained WHY Neo was suddenly able to affect (ie blow up) the machines in the ""real world"".<br/><br/>2) Why weren't they able to detect Neo when he was in The Matrix?  He was laying on the table (not jacked into the Matrix), yet Morphius and Trinity went into the Matrix and rescued him.  Link and the others on the ship were unable to detect Neo in the Matrix.  Why?  There was no explaination...<br/><br/>3) Why did Neo let Smith win the fight at the end of the movie?  Why did he let Smith ""copy"" himself onto Neo?  At one people Smith asks, ""Why do you continue to get up and fight?"" to which Neo replied, ""Because I choose to."" Ok, that seemed like a fitting quote.  But then he suddenly decides to give up the fight and let Smith win?  Why?  Why didn't he just do that to begin with?<br/><br/>4) Why was The Oracle able to ""affect"" Agent Smith?  At the end of the movie, remember when Smith says ""Every beginning has an end."" and then he didn't understand why he said that?  I took that to mean The Oracle was somehow speaking through Smith.  So why was she able to do this?  Were other people able to do this as well?<br/><br/>5) Reloaded introduced the whole ""choice-ology"" or ""choice vs. destiny"" philospohy into The Matrix, which pretty much rendered the original Matrix as a waste of time.  As I understand it, everything in the first Matrix movie was pre-programmed.  All the ""choices"" Neo (and others) made were pre-determined, which basically invalidates the whole movie.<br/><br/>6) They never answered the question of ""who the mother of the Matrix was"" that the Architect brought up in Reloaded.  ""If I am the father of The Matrix, then she is undoubtably the mother of The Matrix"" (paraphrasing there).  To which Neo says, ""You mean The Oracle.""  To which, the Architect replies, ""Please...""  So, who was the mother of the Matrix?  Was it the Oracle or not?<br/><br/>7) The whole ""Train man"" (as well as the Key Maker from Reloaded) thing was stupid.  I think they (the W. Bros.) were trying to give programs more human-ality so they would be more accepted to those who were plugged into The Matrix.  I thought it was just kind of stupid.  Made no sense.<br/><br/>8) They never explained who Smith was able to duplicate himself.<br/><br/>9) Who was Neo able to see ""light"" after his eyes got fried?<br/><br/>10) What happened to ""The twins""?  I thought they were supposed to be a major part in the movie.  Or Persiphone for that matter.  What was he role?<br/><br/>11) In Reloaded, all the predicessors before Neo chose the ""safe"" door, which was to let their love die so that Zion would be saved.  And the Matrix would be reloaded.  Why did they choose this?  What made Neo so different as to risk losing Zion and saving Trinity?<br/><br/>12) Why did The Architect even allow a Zion to begin with?  As I understood it, Zion was part of the design of The Matrix.  There needed to be a Zion (a place for those who were released from the Matrix to retreat to).  But why? The Architect could have easily nuked Zion and The Matrix would still have been working.  They still had people plugged into the Matrix.  Except now they wouldn't have to worry about them getting unplugged.  Again, this makes no sense.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but I am sure by now some of you have seen the same holes and flaws in the movie that I have.  I would rate this movie a 10 on pure action sequences, but maybe a 3 on story.  Like I said, they should have stopped after the first Matrix..."
"PeteBDawg","3","0","0","6 November 2003"," Profoundly Stupid
","The Matrix: Revolutions is a profoundly stupid movie.  It competely disregards all of the questions, philosophical problems, and basic premises of the first two movies and devolves into a boring, wasteful exercise in franchise-killing.  The title of this movie is the only thing that is going to keep it from the HBO at 3 AM sci-fi bargain bin, and even that might not be enough.<br/><br/>This movie is less to be understood as a Matrix film, and more to be understood as roughly on the par with the Carrie Ann-Moss flick ""Red Planet.""  This is a movie in which people and robots have a series of nonsensical fights for unclear reasons in which characters you don't like or care about shoot things and blow things up.  I'm as much of a fan of robots as the next guy (probably more), but Revolutions doesn't have nearly cool enough robots to justify its huge expense or ponderous pacing.  You could have made this exact same movie with only a slight drop in quality for roughly one tenth of what was spent on it.<br/><br/>Keanu puts in a solid performance in this one, doing everything that is asked of him, even though most of those things are the result of either idiodic or inattentive writing.  Still, this movie ranks slightly below _Johnny Mnemonic_ (the Ultimate Hard Drive) in terms of quality, with all of the sloppy cyberpunk wankery, but none of the wry humility or charm.<br/><br/>What is most surprising in this movie are the things that do not happen. No new characters are introduced.  Not a single point in the movie is there depicted a person inside the Matrix who does not already know it is fake. There are no ""bullet-time"" special effects to speak of.  There is no acknowledgement of the situation presented at the end of the second movie, let alone the situation presented at the end of the first movie (each of which, it should be noted, is entirely incompatible with the other). There are no Twins.  There are no vampires or werewolves (which, as you may recall, were promised in the second movie).  There is no resolution to any of the problems, nor remotely plausible answers to any of the questions. There are many Agent Smiths, but you never see them fight.<br/><br/>It is a movie in which the only thing that saves the incredibly stupid and useless protagonists are the marginally more stupid and useless robot hordes.  Among other silly things, the humans build robot suits that offer very limited mobility and no protection to the wearer.  The combat contraptions don't even have doors or windshields.  And they don't give the poor pilot guy a helmet, either .  These giant robot suits are perplexingly built, not to fire mounted heavy weapons, but to carry hand guns ""gangster-style.""<br/><br/>The only reason they have even a marginal level of success is because a malevolent artificial intelligence that can construct an entire artificial human world indistinguishable from the real can't figure out how to utilize complex ""gun"" or ""bomb"" technology, and instead arms all of his minions with tentacle-knives and instructs them to geometrically swarm like bees in a Foghorn Leghorn cartoon.  It turns out that ""gangster-style"" robot suit handguns work pretty well against an enemy that can fly around in large groups, but doesn't know enough to so much as drop a rock on your exposed and easily-crushed head.  But well enough?  You won't hear spoilers from me.<br/><br/>The previous two paragraphs, as well as an extended sequence in which a hovercraft flies in a straight line for twenty minutes, make up the middle 45 minutes of the movie.  At least.<br/><br/>My God, this movie is stupid.  I can only wonder what sort of terrible accident might have befallen the original concept for the Matrix Reloaded, because I cannot conceive of anybody sitting down at a table and thinking this particular sequence of moving images was worth making.<br/><br/>
Unless, of course, this is an incredibly intelligent meta-movie, and that the tagline ""Everything that has a beginning has an end"" is a reference to a deleterious view of the progress of the human mind, moving from acuity and philosophical rigor to retirement, idleness, senility, and finally oblivion. Because this is a senile, oblivious movie.  If ""Everything that has a beginning has an end"" is the final moral of the story, the movie is an incredible metafilmic success, because I cannot imagine a movie that would make a stronger case for there never ever being another Matrix movie ever again."

","The only problem I had with the movie was the certain scene in the downed Logos between Neo and Trin, it was a little drawn out. I hope I didn't give to much away. It didn't have the seeming invulnerability that Neo had in Reloaded so I think it had more of a similar feel to the first movie but it was a dark piece and very epic. Tied it all up perfectly. I still want more though and for that I feel incomplete, but I don't want any sequels maybe just a well written book that kinda goes into the third renaissance or something."

","I kept waiting for the outlined heads of Tom Servo, Crow, and Mike to come in from the right side of the screen.  Mystery Science Theater would have a field day with the dialogue in this.<br/><br/>My friends and I went to the theater expecting very little, based on the second movie.  We hoped to be entertained, have some fun, but had no hope in anything of blast-me-away quality, or even anything good.<br/><br/>We were entertained-- like the rest of the audience, we were laughing at how sappy the dialogue was, and how incredulous these characters had become in their shallowness.  ""The Scene"" (discussed more than once in comments here) between Trinity and Neo was beyond belief in its sap quality.  I've read better romantic X-Files fanfics written by teenage girls than this.  One of my friends coined it best-- ""Excuse me, hi.. Neo?  Yeah... could you wiggle one of those poles a bit so we can get this scene over with and get through the rest of the movie?  Thanks.""<br/><br/>I have to be reminded why Morpheus or Trinity are even in this movie- what exactly do they *do*?  What purpose do they serve? Scenes that could evoke horror in human beings-- the fields of humans being grown (so emphasized in first movie as an image that haunted Morpheus) could have added such impact.  But they're barely seen in the distance, and reactions from Neo and Trinity are negligible at best.<br/><br/>I could care less about any of the other characters.  To be honest, I didn't know the names of the humans of Zion as I left the theater.<br/><br/>There was nothing to like, nothing to relate to.<br/><br/>Sure, some of the graphics were fantastic, and at times even beautiful to watch-- but I didn't come to the movie to watch a lot of amazing CGI graphics.  I can get that with video games at my house these days.<br/><br/>It's sad, because I enjoyed the first movie on so many levels. Those levels are completely gone with this movie.<br/><br/>What a waste of my sleep time last night.<br/><br/>2/10.  (one point for the CGI)"

I think that too many people went into the movie with very high expectations, or had their own opinion on how the movie should end. When it didn't go their way, they weren't having a good time! I think that if you go into it without your own ideas on how the movie should go, you will enjoy yourself and come out feeling the same as me.  So I say...It was good enough for me!

"Psiman-2","6","0","0","6 November 2003"," 'Return of the Jedi' for the Internet Generation.
","It has been said by many that the Matrix Trilogy could be like the Star Wars Trilogy for the Internet Generation. By that rationale it would make 'The Matrix: Revolutions' our Return of the Jedi. To many extents this is true. It caps off the Trilogy with a definite ending but still allows some scope for sequels. The focus of the protagonists is to overcome a seemingly impossible enemy at a point where their very survival is on the line. But, unfortunately, like Jedi this is, in my opinion, the worst of the trilogy. Thankfully it is not for the same reasons as 'Return of the Jedi'. By which I mean it's not a cop out that shamelessly cashes in on the heartfelt sentiments of a potential audience. There are no fluffy teddies here to appeal to the younger female audience that would otherwise have gone to see 'Care Bears the Movie'. We were told through the hype that Reloaded and Revolutions were really one movie split down the middle. Experiencing the films in close succession didn't leave me with that impression. 'The Matrix: Revolutions' feels quite different to Reloaded in that the visual focus shifted from action mainly based within the Matrix to that based in the `real world'; the philosophical musings shifted from understanding `why' we make choices to understanding that we can and the main action content shifted from heavily Martial Arts based fight scenes to lead-fuelled fire fights. Even the techno-rock soundtrack has all but been replaced with an original dramatic score. What has been created is a very different kind of movie although saying that there is a transition between the two at the beginning of Revolutions as it once again includes the Merovingian and his entourage.<br/><br/>Again, as with the previous Matrix movies, this film has set the bar for cinematic computer generated graphics. Again, unfortunately, as with Reloaded the CG parts are far too obvious and therefore fail in what they are trying to achieve. They should work by the rule 'if you can't transition flawlessly from human to CG then don't do it'. The CG is very good but it's not to the standard where we can't tell it from real life so they shouldn't rely on it. There were far too many scenes in which the main character was computer generated and it just doesn't look right when inter-cut with real images of them. The attack on Zion is very impressive, dare I say even jaw dropping in places, as thousands of `squidies' pour into the docking area and attack the humans in their gun-toting mechs. Although this assault on the eyes appeared very impressive at first it wasn't long before I could no longer suspend my disbelief enough to except what was happening. This is something I'm sure you will understand as soon as you have experienced it. It's very much a backs to the wall kind of affair for the humans as they attempt to stave of an insurmountable assault of momentous proportions by the invading machine army.<br/><br/>Although, as previously mentioned, the CG was unbelievable in places it was nothing, on a scale of incredulity, when compared to some of the acting and dialogue. I'm sure it was more to do with what they were saying than how they were saying it. Unfortunately a lot of the dialogue, much like in Reloaded, plodded along and was delivered in such a way as to seem even less believable. Morpheus was reduced from the great teacher to an almost redundant peripheral character. Far too much emphasis was placed on the love between Neo and Trinity. Although this was obviously the intention of the Directors it's not what the majority of the viewing public and fans of the previous movies will probably enjoy. I think we all understood from the previous film how intense their love was for each other and I don't feel that they needed to spend so much time reiterating it in this one. I know that love plays a major part in all of Neo's decisions and is ultimately what allows him to make the choices he does but I think we all understood that from the second film.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film as it was a continuation of the Matrix story and because of expansion of its universe but it's not the conclusion I was hoping for. Watch it if you've seen the others but don't expect to be coming out of the cinema purchasing another ticket to be readmitted. This won't be joining the others in my DVD collection until the price drops to below ten pounds."
"lorddcd","8","0","0","6 November 2003"," I thought it was a good ending
","The visuals were great, the fighting was really good.  My only complaint is that the person playing the oracle was sub par.  She did not give off the wisdom or the confidence that Gloria Fisher did.  Gloria Fisher is just a hard act to follow for the part of the Oracle.  When Gloria talked I wanted to listen, when this new lady talked I just wanted her to get it over with. There wasn't anything the bros could do about this though and were probably pressed for time to find a replacement.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was good despite what people said in previous reviews. However, the feel of this movie is very different then the first two.  I don't understand the reviews about the special effects being bad because they were stellar.<br/><br/>At any rate I give it 8 out of a 10.  Reloaded being 9 out of 10, and Matrix 11/10 heh.  It was a fitting end and tragic at that.  Some of the important emotional scenes really moved me, while other people weren't.  Can't please everyone I guess.<br/><br/>Spoilers<br/><br/>As for the ending, they didn't show how the peace is played out between man and machine as that will most likely take place in the Matrix Online video game.  They like to tie all the stories together using different formats it seems which I think really appeals to the fans.  If you want to find out what happens you will have to play the game and be a part of it."

","Wow, what a ride this trilogy has been.  I know there's been alot of negativity thrown at this series ever since the second one came out, I guess it's to be expected.  When you let it out that you've built an entire strip of freeway for a car chase people take that info label it ""excessive"" and file it away till it's time to review the movie.  When you tell the public about something like the ""Burly Brawl"" people get ready for it in advance and nit pick it to death instead of just enjoying it.  When you make a very successful first movie people judge the next one in the series to it instead of just enjoying that they're getting a continuation of the series from the same writers / directors.  Yes it's possible for the same writer /directors to make a bad movie with a part 2 or 3, but I don't think that happened here.  How do I know this?  Because when I watched parts 2 and 3 without any thought of holding it up and comparing it to the previous installments I was *thoroughly entertained*.<br/><br/>Part 3 is a thrilling conclusion to The Matrix series.  It is HIGHLY entertaining in it's own right with some of the best action scenes put to screen yet.  Yet one reviewer mentioned his not liking it because there wasn't enough Matrix scenes.  Well A) It was mentioned long ago that the second movie would take place mostly in the matrix and the third in the real world and B) Conversely you can turn around and argue that the second movie was bad because it didn't take place enough in the real world.

This third movie brings back the Merovingian and then put him away too fast, after all Trinity and Morpheus had 100+ guns pointed to their heads....how did they escape? This movie doesn't explain the interesting questions of the 2nd and follows a totally different way: a huge battle in the real world and the most classical final combat with the ""boss"". I think that they have followed commercial rules to make this last movie, trying to make a movie for all. In my humble opinion, they have made a trivial movie and have lost a great occasion to give to the movie history a great trilogy."

","Bullet point format for those with ADD.  My apologies if spelling/grammatical mistakes hinders your ability to understand my points (if my comments are popular I may revise).  Here I will bring up some points of interest about Matrix: Revolutions.  Basically, I left the theater a bit disappointed, because I expected more plot twists.  As I sit here writing (a few hours after seeing Revolution) I am decidedly in ""LOVE"" with this movie and the three films as a whole. Unfortunately, if you thoroughly understood the Matrix: Reloaded there will be no major surprises.  Beware **SPOILERS** lie ahead.  You will find no plot summary here. That being said, I will provide context for my points.<br/><br/>**I had to cut down my article from 2,500 words you can find it in the forums.<br/><br/>Mini-Table of Contents: I. To The Critics II. The Ending III. Interesting Points IV. Reasons to Love this Trilogy<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>II.  The Ending<br/><br/>+ I was disappointed with the ending at the theater.  I felt that there should have been more, but it was everything I expected.  Thinking about it more, the ending is not that important to me, but it provides more conclusion a few hours later. It seems as if everything anyone said through out the movie came true.  In the first movie, Trinity reveals that the Oracle predicts that the one she will fall in love with will die.  He did die, but then he came back to life in the first movie.  The end? No.  He dies again, for real this time (pending future movies that beat the dead horse).  Agent Smith is always reminding Neo of the inevitableness of his fate and it all comes true when he copies himself over Neo in the final battle. The Architect has his was too, as the source in Neo is reinserted in the system and the matrix is reloaded.<br/><br/>+ To understand the ending, you must understand what the Architect said in Reloaded.  I can sum it up here, but I am sure others can clarify more than I am able to.  There have been several versions of the Matrix designed for humans to live in.  Earlier versions have not been as successful in retaining humans (preventing them from waking up), until the Oracle made a suggestion.  Choice is the keyword in the Matrix trilogy.  The illusion of choice is what keeps people in the Matrix, but also out of it.  Anyway, periodically the Matrix needs to be restarted, because the citizens that escape increase expontentially.  Obviously, the more people that wake up, the more of them there are to dwell in Zion and to help others escape the Matrix.  So, a pattern is established where the machines kill off Zion and restart the Matrix with 'updates'.  As the Architect explains, Neo (the One) with the source code or key returns to the system and allows the machines to restart the matrix.<br/><br/>+ So what makes this matrix restart unique?  Well there is Agent Smith that complicates things.  In some ways he is a hero, by altering the pattern that the machines made.  When Neo was standing before the Architect he was given a choice to help restart the matrix or return to save Trinity.  Remember: Choice is an ILLUSION inside the matrix.  Many critisized Reloaded for having Neo's powers extend beyond the Matrix, but many also did not pick up on the fact that Agent Smith had already transgressed that boundary. (Remember: the cutting scene when in Reloaded when Bane tries to stab Neo, but is interrupted... to recieve a spoon).  Anyway, it was at this point that the Matrix was to be restarted.  Either choice Neo made the Architect expected Zion to fall.  In Revolutions, when Neo meets up with the Oracle again, she even states that he should have died after returning to Trinity. However, his powers had already melted into the real world with interactions from Agent Smith and he was able to survive conflicts with the squiddy.<br/><br/>+  In the end, Zion does not fall.  Neo realizes that he can not beat Agent Smith, Smith is much better at fighting and can fly, because the two have become similar through various conflicts.  On many boards it seems as if people are confused as to why Agent Smith dies after touching Neo. Remember what the Oracle says about rogue programs at the park in Reloaded. Programs that need to be replaced have two options, return to the source and be deleted or exile.  Agent Smith chooses exile, but is tricked into returning to the source as Neo is ""jacked in"" at the source.  In the end, you see the Oracle lying down in the same hole as Neo once was. You also see Sashi(?) sleeping as code sweeps across the streets, signaling a restart of the matrix.  The matrix can restart now that Agent Smith has been taken care of. The fact that the Oracle is placed in the same position in the crater as Neo just after Agent Smith is wiped out and before the Matrix Reloads suggests that she is the first into the Matrix and the last one out.<br/><br/>
+  There are no really big surprises in Revolutions if you understood Reloaded fully.  Everything the Oracle said is true.  She is a guide, she leads the One/Neo to the source, but allows him to make the choice.  She is after the same thing as him, to save Zion and the human race.  In the final scene after the Matrix has reloaded the Oracle talks to the Architect about the ""ones who choose freedom"" (or something along that line) and he reassures her that they (Zion) will be left alive.  Those that believe the ending is narrow-minded with it's Judo-Christian ending must analyze the whole picture.  One part is that, yes, there is death on Neo's part, but there is also life continues in Zion and rebirth and renewal occurs in the Matrix.  Anyone who limits these ideals to the Judo-Christian religion is choosing to be ignorant."

","Like most other Matrix fans, we were extremely excited about how the last movie of the trilogy would be. We reserved the tickets a few days in advance and we were well on time at the movie theatre so we had very good seats.<br/><br/>The movie was all that we hoped for, the fighting scene's were just as great as they were in Reloaded and the story will rattle your mind once again. I don't want to give too much away in my little story here but I want to share a few nice moments with you, one was when Trinity is threatning the Merovingian and revers to him as: `Merv'. very funny. Also, in the final fighting scene between Smith and Neo, Neo punches Smith in the face in slow motion and you see the first-print of Neo in Smith's face.. Great work!<br/><br/>About the ending; I (and everyone I know) had every possible scenario in mind but what we saw didn't even came close. and still I think that there couldn't be a better ending than this. Do you think Neo and Trinity are holding hands at the end and walking away into the sunset?! Well think again!<br/><br/>The only thing that bothered me, was when we stepped out the theatre and we talked about the movie for a bit and we came to the conclussion that we haven't seen the Twins from Reloaded in this movie, I hoped (and thoughed by the way) that they would return in Revolutions but sadly they really died in the last movie.<br/><br/>Thinking about the other movies I would put them in this order of best movies; Matrix - Revolutions - Reloaded. First one still is they best one in my opinion.<br/><br/>To bad we can't look forward now to another sequel. :(<br/><br/>P.s. percentage men and women in the theatre: 99,5 % men, 0,5 % women!"

","Tolkien claimed to `cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations.. I much prefer history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think many confuse 'applicability' with 'allegory'; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author.'<br/><br/>Why would I start a post about the Matrix trilogy with a quote from Tolkien? Because this notion of applicability is as appropriate to the Matrix trilogy as it was for LOTR.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed all the Matrixes (Matrices for our friends of Latin). Within the Matrix trilogy I saw many things:<br/><br/>1)  Standard messianic tale.<br/><br/>2)  The commonalities of various religions.<br/><br/>3)  The cold war.<br/><br/>4)  Man and machine interdependence.<br/><br/>The action was there merely as a vehicle for telling a story and to help increase the audience for the trilogy from the merely cerebral to the general public.<br/><br/>
Yes, I agree that the actions scenes were, with the exception of the big brawl in Reloaded, fantastic.  New cinematographic ground was broken.  I would like to see Gaeta work with Weta Workshop.<br/><br/>
I hope people enjoy the Matrix trilogy on whatever level works for them. The Matrix trilogy has something for everyone, fantastic action sequences, social/religious commentary, historical commentary, as well as many thing s I may not be able to see.<br/><br/>
The beauty of the Matrix trilogy is applicability.  It contains elements that pervade our lives and history.  See what you want because it is all there, acting as a mirror allowing us to see within the movie that which we choose to see.<br/><br/>
Choice itself is a theme throughout the trilogy, how fitting."

","What a major disappointment. After such plot complexities in Parts 1 & 2, in order to get through to a simplistic mystical resolution the Wachowskis have abandoned character depth, and tragically as we watch we no longer care about them.  There are simply too many characters, new and old, (for example a beautifully presented Indian family at the beginning), yet they disappear without development. Only the main figures of Neo and Trinity have any conclusion - and, hey, death is an easy way to conclude!<br/><br/>The major action sequences continue to combine CGI and real sets in new and mostly exciting ways: the chase after The Hammer is a great rollercoaster; the great battle in Zion is well planned and shot, though the spirals of Sentinels look tacky; the duel between Neo and Smith is just awful. But we are watching characters we hardly know, and whereas, say, the smaller battles in Aliens (one of the many sci-fi 'borrows') have tangible fear by using character and darkness, this has the emotional punch of an 007 film. The Smith/Oracle meld laughs like Mike Myers' Dr Evil - cringe.<br/><br/>The first Matrix held a wonderful balance of strong characterisation, a journey of discovery, wonderful new action/CG, and a sense of revelation. Reloaded continued most of this, albeit in a much clunkier and preachy way. Revolutions only has the action/CG and a facile path to the end, borrowed so superficially from Christianity, Hinduism and Greek tragedy.  ""Everything that has a beginning has an end"" - I wish the beginning of Part 1 hadn't had Part 3's hurried, cheap end!<br/><br/>The Wachowskis have so much genius to offer us - but they now need a strong scriptwriter and producer to control their excesses, which have become juvenile."

","The first Matrix film, in my opinion had so much. A good plot, a dark quality to the scenes inside the matrix etc... but most of all it was a thought provoking intelligent piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Since then the Wachowski brothers have decided to turn the subsequent Matrix films into special effects laden cheesy blockbusters. The plot in Revolutions is vague at best. None of the questions and ideas that the first film raises are addressed.<br/><br/>--SPOILERS--<br/><br/>It just makes me laugh that Neo just asks the machines for ""Peace"" and they agree that as long as Neo defeats Smith that will be so. What about the Matrix? Wasn't that what the struggle was against, are they just gonna unplug everyone now? I thought the human mind couldn't take being woken up past a certain age. Surely peace can't happen if the reasons for the war aren't resolved! The whole thing makes no sense.... but it does give an excuse for a big FX Playstation-looking fight scene between Neo and Smith which seems to have been the priority whilst making this film.<br/><br/>I could go on about the lack of depth to any of the characters in the film. Morpheus is no longer a character but just a cardboard cut out that utters a few cliches here and there.

"alanmurphy","Null","0","0","6 November 2003"," How could they finish the story with this Drivel?
","It is with great sadness that I have to return a verdict of Dire for the Matrix 3. For those who haven't seen it yet, I genuinely hate to be the harbinger of doom and gloom, but it truly is an unimaginably bad film. Everything that was cool about its predecessors (e.g. the slow-mo fighting, shades, overcoats etc) was left out of this installment. There is really only one proper slow-mo/shades/overcoat-style fighting scene in the whole film, and it isn't even that good or long. The final climactic fight scene is so over-the-top that I genuinely didn't particularly enjoy it. Most of the film is just flying around in spaceships, or fighting outside of the Matrix against the insect like 'Sentinels' ala something out of Starship Troopers (not that I have anything against that film, its underrated).<br/><br/>The story is awful. The way in which they paper over plot cracks and wrap things up is so poor that it will leave a sour taste in your mouth. Something that was fantastic about the first film was the elegance with which they explained 'The Matrix' to the audience. It was handled with real finesse, in a way that didn't leave us going 'this is utter nonsense'. One of the lowlights of the second film was undoubtedly 'the Architect' and his infamous soliloquy. It was all a bit convenient and lazy to have this one guy just gush a load of philosophical, metaphysical and technical nonsense in order to (essentially) divulge the entire plot. Instead of finding out things on a piece-meal basis, they just threw it all at us at once under a veneer of confusing jargon and hoped we wouldn't notice. We did. And we weren't impressed.<br/><br/>Well, if you didn't like that, you are going to HATE the third film. Its not that there is another 'single' speech to rival the Architects, but the whole film is laden down with vague assertions and inexplicable behaviors. For instance, Neo will often be observed to say something like 'I know what it is I have to do now'. We will not be enlightened as to how he came to his epiphany, and when he takes his (now apparently prescribed) course of action, you will be saying 'what the hell was all that about anyway?'.<br/><br/>Also, the script was laughable. The awful nature of the script's dialog was happily accepted in Matrix 1, and tolerated in Matrix 2 (the architect scene notwithstanding). But when the script has to be endured in this truly awful third installment, without the more enjoyable facets of the first two films to dilute and mollify its effect, it becomes almost unbearable. There are only two types of characters in the Matrix. Those who know nothing (type a), and those who know something, but inexplicably wont tell you (type b). Neo usually falls into the former category. As with most of the characters in the films, he is perpetually stoic, and 90% of the time will only say one of the three following things: 'Why?', 'But how?', 'I don't know'. Then there is the latter type (type b), the one who knows but wont tell. This category is championed by 'The Oracle', but, hugely annoyingly, would encompass virtually every character (including Neo at times) of the third installment. These Bastards answer every question with another question or riddle. So a conversation between any two characters in the Matrix will usually go as follows:<br/><br/>Type a character: 'What do I have to do?' Type b character: 'You will know when the time is right?'<br/><br/>Being such a fanstatical film, the Matrix was always going to have to paper over plot cracks and holes, and I think this was achieved with real gusto in the narrative of Matrix 1. But in part 3, its like trying to paper over the grand canyon with one measly roll of toilet paper. In my opinion, the Wackowski brothers wrote half a good story, but then got so out of their depths that they couldn't come up with a decent, satisfying, meaningful way to bring their story to conclusion. The tag-line of the film is 'Everything that has a beginning has an end'. The Irony is that I feel that the Matrix 3 is so bad, that the story almost 'doesn't' have an end, at least not a satisfying one. And now for my trademark over-the-top, controversial, climactic rant polemic: I feel that the Matrix 3 is so incredibly dismal, that I would even sacrifice part 2 (which I regard as a decent enough effort) for the Wackowski brothers to have just stopped after the first film. I genuinely think I would prefer if the story had ended after Matrix 1.<br/><br/>I thank you for your time."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","10 November 2003"," Back to basics
","Spoilers<br/><br/>Sitting in my seat in the cinema at the start of Matrix Revolution, I felt as if I had just been to the washroom during the middle of a movie and now back to continue watching. Maybe that's exactly what the Wachowski brothers wanted: no fanfare, no fancy opening scene, but a simple continuation of Matrix Reloaded. I have no problem with that.<br/><br/>The first Matrix received a great deal of compliment on its originality. The idea of humans going into the computer is, however, hardly original, if you have seen movies like Tron (1982). Indeed, Matrix packages this idea into a pseudo philosophical trip, but the accent here is pseudo. The beauty (very literally) of Matrix is in the choreographed action sequences, as well as the stylish and cool art direction. Matrix Reloaded expanded on all these aspects of Matrix, materialised the world called Zion, added a few interesting characters, and topped everything off with a legendary highway chase scene filmed on a highway they actually built for this very purpose.<br/><br/>
At the end of my IMDB comments on Matrix Reloaded, I asked a rhetorical question: how is Matrix Revolution going to keep up with, let alone surpass, Matrix Reloaded. The answer is: it doesn't. In this final chapter of the Matrix trilogy, there are three main action sequences, which I'm not going to deal with in chronological order, but rather in reverse order of merit.<br/><br/>The most disappointing is the supposedly titanic duel between Neo and Agent Smith. The effect-enhancing background of rain and water has been used before, and better, elsewhere. One is Hong Kong's `A Man Called Hero' (1999); the other is Korea's Volcano High (2001). The choreographed action, somewhat overused, has ceased to impress. And (I really must apologise here) Neo's resilience in coming back time after time, despite the noble sentiments behind it, is beginning to look a little bit like Jason (you know, the guy who just fought Freddy). An improvement would have been a finale duel scene between Trinity and Agent Smith, for a change. Carrie-Anne Moss does her wire-fu thing a lot more stylishly than Keanu Reeves, with due respect to the non-action portion of his performance. <br/><br/>Somewhat better is the second of the three main action sequences, i.e. the shooting rampage which is really a repeat of the scene in Matrix where Neo and Trinity were blasting their way through to rescue Morpheus. The only difference is that this time it's Trinty, Morpheus and Seraph instead, with some of the enemies walking up-side-down on the roof.<br/><br/>What really makes me feel that the movie is worth watching is the third and last of these main action sequences: the attack of Zion, and this is where `back to basics' comes in. The scene is well set up, with preliminaries such as marshalling of hard ware, brief coverage of each of the characters taking part, etc, etc. The strategy is clearly set out, from the full-blast, head-on assault the moment the shield has been broken (drilled, to be exact) through to the last heroic stand at the entrance of the temple. The parallel action line of the Niobe's (Jada Pinkett Smith) ship is also given due recognition. To the cynics, I'd say: yes, we've seen all these before. The mechanical colossus shaped fighters are expanded versions of the mechanical loaders that Sigourney Weaver drove to blast the `bitch' into space in Aliens. Come to think of it, the metallic swamping squids are not unlike the metallic crawling creatures in Aliens. Niobe's ship running the impassable passage is really Luke Skywalker in Star Wars running the gauntlet again. Some may even say that you can get all these in a video game lounge. However, I'm not going to let these observations deter me from full enjoyment of this thirty minutes of spectacular visual audio extravaganza, plus the good old fashion good-against-evil sentiment going back to Star Wars, Spartacus, as well as forward to Return of the King. Best of all is fiercely beautiful Jada Pinkett Smith, on whose performance alone the level of this sequence, and possibly the entire movie, is raised several notches."

The 'history lessons' contained are perhaps crucial to understanding what Revolutions, and the trilogy, are all about.<br/><br/>Anyone who says that this movie is less cerebral than Reloaded is both right and wrong.  Reloaded was a lesson in philosophy, Revolutions is about the personal application of it, bringing it to a very human and societal level.<br/><br/>There is enough here to satisfy anyone who is prepared to look for it, to put the effort into the understanding of what the Wachowski brothers are trying to tell us.  This isn't so much about the future, or the nature of reality, it's about humanity today.<br/><br/>The movie is let down, in my eyes, only briefly, where a couple of scenes come across as cheesy, rather than powerful.  If you can get past that to thinking about the point of the scenes, it doesn't matter too much - they're only short moments.<br/><br/>I'm 90% sure I know now exactly who the Merovingian is, what Seriph represents, and the answers to many other questions left hanging previously. The missing 10% makes me want to see the film again - because I'm sure the answers are all there to be found.<br/><br/>But ultimately, that's not what any of the Matrix films were about.

","The last half hour of the film is good, but the rest is a major disappointment, what with the endless Star-Wars type battles (made semi-watchable thanks to Jada Pinkett's intense performance, at least) and the dreary dud of a script (the audience was actually laughing at how stupid some of the lines were).  The only really decent line was delivered by Neo near the very end, and Mary Alice was great as the Oracle."

","Okay, this is my first review for IMDB, so you're going to have to forgive me.  I went to see Matrix Revolutions yesterday (I waited till it was actually out in theatres...) and I wanted to write as soon as I got home. I really hated the second movie's plot.  I was hoping for an action movie and I didn't get it. The third movie is also not an action movie, so if you're go there to see a whole lot of fights and things blowing up, you're going to walk away disappointed.  But, I rated it a seven out of ten because this movie has so much more in it than just action.  Sure, the plot's a little bit hard to follow if you're a complete idiot, but I'm not, so that wasn't really a problem.  The swarm-like entity near the end was awesome, in my oppinion.<br/><br/>I wish there had been a few more fights, sure, but the fights they did have were pretty good.  I'm hoping that the DVD shows Trinity, Morphius and Sereph having to fight their way out of the Frenchman's club, it seemed to end far too quickly for my tastes.  I guess it's cuz I'm a DM.. But, on the whole, I think everyone who saw the first two is going to HAVE to see this one, just because it's a trilogy.  I think that it's worth the money I paid for it, but it's NO ""Return of the Jedi"".  So, for those of you that didn't go see it the first day (if there are any of you), you should go see it, but just don't have your expectations so high that they cannot be reached. There are two scenes that drag on a bit, especially one where Trinity trys to express herself to Neo right before his final confrontation, but though they do take away from the movie, the special effects bring enough to the table that they can be forgiven...eventually. I hope this isn't over a thousand words yet.  I've never been good at limiting myself to anything... Walk in Light, peeps... JM"

","This, the third, and one must hope final Matrix movie puts the final nail in the coffin of this series hopes of becoming iconic movie making. In 10 years no-one will give a damn. In hindsight the sequels were always going to disappoint. The best feature of the original, what made it truly special was bullet time. Period. The plot was interesting, and most of the performances good, but the action scenes made it special. It was always going to be difficult to top these, and impossible for anything to have the same effect as the lobby sequence (Which they ape in this film, was less convincingly). And the point is; that wasn't down to the Wachowski's. It was down to the guy who invented the technology. All the praise though went to the lucky comic book authors who suddenly believed they were auteurs, and started behaving like such. Lucas escaped this by giving up directors duties on Empire; no-one suggested that to Andy and Larry. The result is a 5 hour mess with a story which could fill 2.(spoilers) In the end it seems quite simple. There was a war nobody could win, but both sides wanted to destroy each other. By using Neo's uniqueness (he appears to be some kind of Jesus figure, performing miracles, dying suspended in the air for the good of the people) the oracle gives agent smith the power to bring the world to the brink of destruction, knowing a truce would have to be made. Justification for allowing the machines life is given by the irritating little girl and her parents, sacrificing themselves for their `daughter' a pointless program. This lack of logic proves they are alive, disproving Smith's point about love being a human condition. This theory is hammered home by the corny end scene with the architect telling the oracle she played a `dangerous game'. All the crap philosophising over the movies was pure filler, to stretch the concept to two movies, an idea which looked shaky in reloaded, and an abomination in revolutions. The battle of Zion was the most emotionless pile of clichéd drivel seen since Armageddon. The kid who overcomes his fear to save the day, the brave general who dies heroically, though not before given final words to aforementioned kid. The scared woman who sees her butch buddy get killed before saving the day in the exact same way her brother did in the first film. With a bit more common sense used one good sequel could have been made, the freeway chase was fantastic, neo v 1000 smiths, daft but fun and the final fight okay, despite being ridiculously overblown. But you are unlikely to get much common sense from two comic book geeks with over inflated egos and budgets, are you?"

They are still plugged into the Matrix, they just believe that they are unplugged? Zion is just a figment of everybodies collective imagination. That would explain better how Neo can use his powers outside the matrix to stop the sentinals would'nt it, instead of simply saying that somehow the powers of the one traverse the two worlds? If the powers follow Neo outside the Matrix, why could'nt he use his abilities against Bane instead of having just a regular brawl? Maybe I'm wrong in my thinking, but after seeing Reloaded that was the only scenario that made sense and I believe the Wachowski brothers did'nt have enough time to figure out how to make that work so they copped out.

","Hmm what can I say? Was this just a bunch of nice cgi-scenes, or an actual movie? Pretty weak compared to the first movie in terms of plot. Even the second movie was better (even with its boring first half of almost nothing but Zion crap). If you like me, enjoy it when they are inside the matrix, like they were a lot in the first movie- and to some extent in the second movie, you'll hate this movie. It takes place mostly in ZZzzZZion, although this time it's action that takes place there, and not long drama-like-your-mom-watches-on-tv scenes, like in the second movie. But I want to see stuff going on inside the matrix, not it that craphole of a supposedly ""real"" world they live in. Also, the few scenes that did take place with people actually jacked into the matrix, seemed like poorly designed maps from some random game. You didn't get the feeling that they were in a virtual reality representation of a whole planet. The worst part of this movie, was that in the previous two movies, the brothers had chosen a track by Rage Against The Machine to be played as the credits rolled. They didn't in this one! Major bummer! I was looking forward to hearing what track they had chosen, and so were many others.<br/><br/>All in all this isn't a bad movie, and as it is a part of a trilogy in which the loose ends are wrapped up, it is essential to watch.

Why is it that you are not satisfied?<br/><br/>When i saw Revolutions the first time at the premiere i got goosebumps quite a few times. And one thing that i love about it is that the brothers thought of making not just an action-movie, like filmmakers normally do. Hardcore action straight through for 2 hours, where is the stimulation? In these movies we get to see more interaction between the characters, than in any other action-movie, and that leads us to get to know the characters more and feel more for them... get to feel some empathy.

"Merman","7","0","0","6 November 2003"," Why not wait another 4 years?
","Four years ago we witnessed a true revolution in modern Western cinematography with the release of The Matrix. It combined modern digital techniques (of which some were of a totally new nature), with Eastern martial arts. And it was highly influenced by comics and Japanese manga. At the time The Matrix was released, the makers, the mysterious Wachowski brothers, announced this was the first in a trilogy. In May 2003 the centerpiece The Matrix Reloaded saw the light of day and made clear the initial movie could not be surpassed. Now the time has come for the last installment: The Matrix Revolutions. Thank God we did not have to wait yet another four years. Yet that might have been a wise decision: a better plot would have been worth the wait.<br/><br/>The review contains spoilers, in the sense that it gives an opinion about the plot of the trilogy. If you don't wish to know too much about it, go see the movie first and then read this review. I won't tell you how the movie ends; I will just give my vision on the ending. these 'spoilers' are in the last paragraph of this review.<br/><br/>Zion, the last human city, is making preparations for a final battle with the machines. In the meantime the crew that was left outside of Zion in Reloaded try to fight their way back to Zion escaping the machines' attacks. Neo and Trinity decide to penetrate Machine City in order to destroy what is the core of the machines' power.<br/><br/>
The main weakness for Reloaded was the fact it was totally out of balance, in comparison to the first 1999 movie. The Matrix was a perfect combination of martial arts, cinematographic tricks, story, philosophy and a comic-style look. Reloaded shifts more to the philosophical side, focusing on the background of how the matrix came about, regardless of its many action scenes (including a climatical highway chase).<br/><br/>Revolutions however, is Reloaded's complete antithesis. Its main merit is the fact there is no direct explanation of - or reference to - Reloaded. The movie starts rather abruptly yet slow, without a spectacular opening scene. And the first half hour is filled with completely gibberish dialogue. All I could think of was: 'yeah sure, interesting, but get started with the action.' Well action we get; the second half of the movie is of a visual quality we have not seen elsewhere. From the moment the machines literally drill themselves into Zion, turning it into an all devouring inferno, you find yourself on a rollercoaster ride that doesn't end until you've been shaken, slammed and beaten. I don't recall ever seeing something so visually stunning in a movie. The digital effects are absolutely incredible and the visuals alone are worth a second visit to the movie theater or a DVD purchase. The only weakness of this overwhelming assault on the senses, however, is that the story moves to the background, creating too sharp a contrast with the first half of the movie.<br/><br/>As I said before I won't elaborate too much on the ending of the trilogy, but I could not help finding the eventual outcome rather disappointing, dissatisfying, weak and to tell you the truth: utter crap. The compromises that are being made are not what an audience wants to see. We don't expect the trilogy to end in remise, especially because of the high expectations that were raised at the start of the trilogy. The directors take huge risks by giving some main characters unexpected fates. The similarity between Neo and the Messiah (call him Jesus) begin to pierce the mind more strongly when watching the final scene. I couldn't help thinking that Wachowski's settled for an easy answer to a difficult question. The open ending makes us fear the worst: a fourth installment is not out of the question - and that is exactly what would bring down the first Matrix even more."

","The third and maybe final chapter in the Matrix series.<br/><br/>After a brilliant first movie and in my opinion excellent sequel, comes a complete let down of a movie.  The problem of this final chapter is in the name 'Matrix'.  The reason we loved the first and the second was because of what happens in the Matrix, not the boring world outside.<br/><br/>
The Matrix world gave the directors the chance to really push the visuals and action.  The problem with Zion, is it's a rather dull boring place. This film was almost entirely set in this boring place.<br/><br/>More annoying was the non-existent mess of a plot.  The first film was almost perfect in adding layers and layers to the plot, which made it an usually deep action movie.  The second, which a number of people have criticised, took the story on even further explaining the real bigger story of the Matrix and Neo's involvement in it.  The third ignored all this and delivered a battle and an ending without any real depth or style.  Gone is the story from the first two.<br/><br/>Where are the explanations that we expected after Reloaded.  What are these ghost programs, what's their purpose,  what was that train driver crap. What happened to all the other ships, why the hell don't they have EMP's in Zion.  What was the point of the little girl at the end.  What was the point of the Merovingian and all that pontificating, for what.  What was the point of the kiss by Persephone in Reloaded.<br/><br/>The sad thing is I could have written a better ending than this.  How about both worlds being in the Matrix and this whole adventure was to qualify people to be able to leave the Matrix.  At least that would have been a sci-fi ending.<br/><br/>Bitterly disappointed, as the Matrix films and the Animatrix had created such a good deep story line that was ruined by the last chapter."

"MaxKing","Null","0","0","9 November 2003"," the Matrix reflections...
","Throughout American cinema, some of the best movies have come in threes. Such has been the case with `the Godfather', `Star Wars', `Indiana Jones', and `Back to the Future'.  And now, after November 5th, such is the case with the latest Sci-Fi action trilogy, `the Matrix'.  After the gripping cliffhanger of `the Matrix Reloaded', this early yet awaited finale, `the Matrix Revolutions' has concluded the next of these remembered trilogies. 	Granted, `Revolutions' had points against it, but even so, despite all about it that is flawed, its entertainment value is undeniable.  There were many times throughout the movie that I found myself smiling, almost in spite of myself.  Beyond its faults and fallacies, the movie is enjoyable. 	The most unique element of this film was the setting of the action.  There are two scenes, at the beginning and the end, that take place in the Matrix. But the greater majority of the action, in fact half of the movie, takes place in the real world.  As the plot loops around, hurdling kamikaze-style towards the climax, the story almost completely transpires on board hovercraft and inside Zion.  Also, out of place though it may seem, the almost western-style brawl between Bane and Neo was refreshingly reminiscent of earlier action movies. However, `Revolutions' was sadly predictable.  The trilogy has been set up according to a very precise cinematic formula.  The first movie introduced us to the basic concepts (e.g. the One, the war, the Matrix itself), and ends on the optimistic note `Neo is the One, and he's going to end the war!' `Reloaded' expanded into how he is meant to end the war.  It also throws the audience a number of curveballs, like the revelation of the Architect and the cyclical perpetuation of the Matrix-Zion system.  Then there came the cliffhanging ending, with Neo comatose, Trinity faithfully at his side. `Revolutions' had nowhere to go but to the conclusion suggested by the first movie: the end of the war. 	Despite the one-track plot, the movie makes up for its story by storytelling.  The film continuously jumps from character to character to character.  Thus, we are shown the stories within the larger story.  We see the plights of Commander Lock, Niobe, Neo, the Kid, and Zee.  However, fortunately, the continuity of these stories holds together.  There is a plausible and quite necessary link between each scene-jump, so it moves fluidly.  Essentially, the movie makes up for the simplicity of the actual story by telling it from five different angles of perspective. 	The one final complaint that may be said against the movie is its lack of denouement.  Much like the Hammer Studio films of the fifties, once the climax concludes, so does the movie.  This creates a pure sense of dissatisfaction, as pertains to the multi-angular perspective of the story. Essentially, the battle is fierce, brutal, and horrific.  And then it's over, and we jump to the Oracle talking to the Architect in a sunny park outside Sydney, Australia.  And after a brief while understandable smattering of dialogue the end-credits begin to roll. 	Still, despite these flaws and fallacies, and that rather unsatisfactory ending, the movie was very enjoyable.  It is a clear reflection of the first two movies, as much as it is a finale to them.  There are a grand variety of symbols from and references to the first and second movie, which can be fun to look for, for some.  It is also the most intense of the movies.  There are no small special effects in this one.  But why would there be?  It is one to be enjoyed."

","I think it's appropriate that the third and final Matrix installment has occurred under the current Bush administration, because both the current political state and the entire Matrix concept is about freedoms from oppression. Had this movie been made pre-2000, most people would have felt the movie was made about the Clinton years, where Big Brother told you what to do and not what to do, what you could have and couldn't have - sounds a lot like the robot mechanisms fighting humanity, eh? I turned to my friend and told him this and he nodded thoughtfully. It's amazing just how brutal a socialistic liberal society can be - thank goodness we only get to see the outcome of such a world on celluloid, and thankfully don't have to worry about it now - at least not until the pendumlum, unfortunately, swings back to the left.<br/><br/>8-of-10"

Keanu barely gets a look-in.<br/><br/>One of the worst movies of the year.

","In some respects it isn't really fair to put down The Matrix because it doesn't stretch to three films. The third outing is a little better than the second, with better action and a modest Star Trek level plot.<br/><br/>I did like the action scenes, which didn't always give way to the meaningless fast paced CGI of many films these days. They reminded me of Aliens, with frenetic life or death fighting scenes backed up by hokum characters. But Neo's journey now follows a separate and unhelpful subplot, much like the video game it is no doubt modeled for.<br/><br/>After seeing the various short films in the Animatrix, its obvious that The Matrix as a whole remains a strong idea, even past the first movie. But under commercial pressure, the need for fireworks finally upends the whole enterprise, and we come away knowing that at Least Return of the King will still be worthwhile."

","This movie is definitely worth seeing, but it is one of the most disappointing sequels to ever be made.  It made a single tear run down my cheek after seeing and thinking about how great it could have been.  If every beginning has an end it is a travesty that this had to end in such a manner.<br/><br/>This movie is full of untied loose ends and piles of dead time that should have found its way to the cutting room floor.  This series began as being a sci-fi influenced action movie that blew audiences away with its innovative special effects and imagery.  With the 2 part next installment its creators decided that with their prior mega-success of the first matrix movie that they were distinguished, artistic, and highly intellectual filmmakers. This surfaced in Reloaded, but there was still a large portion of the amazing action sequences that made the franchise loved in the first place. Revolutions although made at the same time as reloaded has a whole different approach.<br/><br/>This film is loaded with long drawn out deeply pseudo-intellectual dialogues that bring the aggressive and fun nature of the previous Matrix movies to a screeching halt.  There is just enough action in this film to keep the audience remotely interested.<br/><br/>I just don't understand how such a visually stunning enterprise could evolve into something far from its original intentions.  As a deep and `heady' type of film this fails miserably, and as a blockbuster big action high energy film it falls short as well.<br/><br/>This film could have been cut to about an hour and 45 minutes and would have been much more enjoyable.  Instead the in depth dialogues and explanations to nowhere along with a ridiculously long goodbye to Trinity remind me of the bizarre orgy scene from Reloaded which still perplexes me.<br/><br/>The creators could have made much better use of the time by tying up many of the loose ends left at the end of the movie.  As far as that goes all I can hope for is an Animatrix 2.  All I can do is voice how disappointed I am in this movie.  I was really stoked for the last installment and was let down greatly.  I just would have liked to have seen the movie stick with the style of the original.  It was just a fun movie that can't help but be loved.<br/><br/>Anyway like Kevin Costner this film took itself way to seriously and was disappointing.  I have a strange feeling that unless they go back to what worked best in the first Matrix movie The Wachowski brothers won't have another big hit.  But then again they can cry all the way to the bank because they are rich MFR's now and I can only wish it was me.

They made everyone think wait this it not the greastest movie of all time. Which isn't far from the truth, but oh man does it give the greats a run for their money, not that the acting is on par with the godfather, or even star wars for that matter, haha but the story, the undertones, and the SPECIAL EFFECTS, make this the most astounding cinematic achievement since The Two Towers, and it will remain that way perhaps for another 6 weeks.  But I honestly believe the Return of the King will not come close to this in the effects department, though that is obviously not everything.<br/><br/>Now to start off the negative end of the film, the hoakiness, i think this played a little too lighthearted in places and there is a bleeding monologue that will irritate you beyond words.  But then those two scenes are a collective 5 minutes of the 129  minutes run time.  So you figure, that theres about 124 minutes of jaw dropping visuals.

","Having just seen the final part of the trilogy, I am quite convinced that it could have been a two-logy or whatever it is called. Even better, it could have been much better if The Matrix remained just one film.<br/><br/>Anyways, out of all three, Reloaded sucked the most. Not that Revolutions got any nearer to The Matrix, but it was much closer to it. It had almost the same atmosphere as the first part. Ironically, just now they are showing The Matrix on one of the TV channels and I, of course, am watching it. So I couldn't help but confirming my impression that Revolutions is the sequel to The Matrix. Reloaded wasn't.<br/><br/>What I liked the most about Revolutions was that it was leading somewhere - to the logical end of it all. Maybe that's what it was meant to be after all. In Revolutions there was much less talk and fighting without purpose, while it appered that in Reloaded it was an end in itself. What I didn't like the most was the ending. I mean, WHAT THE HELL?! Are we to sit tight and wait for some more sequels or what?! I understand that maybe someday the Wachowski brothers might run out of money and decide to use the good old recipe, but this would really suck. Just look at what happened to the Star Wars - it was a cult until Lucas decided to make some more money out of it. As a friend put it after the movie: ""I know you are a huge fan of The Matrix, but would you like to see it spoiled?"" I guess she's right.

","the basic problem with the movie is that they tried to do too many things at once (too much of special effects too many characters etc.) i think that the producer joel silver and the studio chiefs messed up the movie, they tried to do something spectacular with the movie which ended up in a disaster. the reason the special effects didnt leave audiences in awe was that they worked on two movies at once instead of one at a time, it took them so long that by the time the movie was released the effects became obsolete kinda pretty much regular effects that u see in any movie. they also thought of running this movie in oscar race so they tried to put some emotional stuff to make it look more serious(like the scene when trinity is dying. it just goes on and on and on).  the story isnt complex atall and the script isnt intricate which would be the basic characteristic of a matrix movie. u never find urself sitting on the edge of ur seat. after watching the scene where architect and neo meet i thought there is more to the story than we initially thought(like one matrix running inside other) but there was nothing more to surprise me. i would call this an average hollywood movie a typical joel silver production (cool action scenes, black people working with white, chicks dancing in night clubs in cool clothes, and people with lotsa guns). i will rate this movie a 6.5/10."

"FilmOtaku","3","0","0","9 November 2003"," Everything that has a beginning has an end... thank goodness
","This trilogy started out so promisingly; a fact that makes its demise all the more disappointing.  When I saw the original Matrix, I was blown away; I had never seen anything like it and therefore was excited to see the next `chapter'.  Reloaded was actually a passable film, but more for its flash than its substance.  But, I decided to reserve full judgment until I saw Revolutions.  Now I can very succinctly describe my reaction: Disappointment.  <br/><br/>How can a film be histrionic and convoluted with sufficient amounts of action and yet still be incredibly boring at the same time?  See the film and find out.  Love scenes that I should have found endearing instead elicited snickers instead, and the action and plot progression was handed to us in an orderly manner that betrayed the films that came before it. <br/><br/>
Was there anything good about this film?  Sure.  The end result was mildly satisfactory and the special effects were tight, but probably the most gratifying and beneficial thing that I personally felt that came from seeing this film was the strain it put on my brain while trying to figure out why this film was such a bummer.  In honor of the reverence I hold for the first installment, I tried to make allowances.  One example:  The effects have been so overdone since the original Matrix and there have been so many copycats that we have become desensitized to it.  The more I think about that statement, the less I believe it is true, at least personally, because I was impressed by the effects and action sequences in Reloaded, which I just saw less than 6 months ago.  I also second-guessed my decision to reserve full judgment of Reloaded based on the conclusion in Revolutions.  I recently saw Tarantino's Kill Bill twice and loved it so much without seeing Vol. 2 that I realized that my hesitation with Reloaded could be construed as a cop-out, simply because I wanted so much to enjoy the film based on my admiration for The Matrix.  <br/><br/>Bottom Line:  Go see it if you want to `complete' the trilogy.  But don't expect anything because you won't get it.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

The once legendary one liners only come across as dull and stupid in this one and as if moviegoers across the world haven't seen it often enough yet, we once again see Trinity do her jump-freeze-hit thing. <br/><br/>And then, without giving away any spoilers, the movie does not supply the hoped for answers, but closes with space wide open for another sequel or a network return as a television series.

","Well after the trailers and the hype i have to say that i was really looking forward to seeing the Matrix Revolutions. What i got to see was not as great as i expected, but it was not awful either, it was ok, just ok. But the more i started thinking about it afterwards, the more  i liked it...<br/><br/> The start of the movie is almost perfect, filled with the usual Matrix action sequences and the explanation to what happened to Neo ,which is this movie's number one problem, you see after all the theories that have been posted all over the net, and in this site too, the explanation given by the brothers is a bit well... stupid and too farfetched... And then to the second problem, these first 20 minutes are the last we'll see of the Matrix... (except for the final showdown of course) But come to think of it that's not such a bad thing, you see the brothers used all their gunfighting and Kung-Fu fighting ideas in the previous Matrix films so these action sequences are a complete repetition of the other two films, the ""cloak room shoot out"" for example is identical to the ""lobby shoot-out"" scene in the first film, only that this time the bad guys are running on the ceiling... The second part of the movie takes place in the real world and for its largest part it shows us the last stand of the humans in Zion. This battle is one of the best i've ever seen, the CGI created Sentinels look excellent and most importantly, REAL! Every time they change formations i can guarantee that you'll be picking up your jaw from the floor! However, there is a big fault in the flow of the film here since for the duration of this battle we don't get to see Neo and Trinity at all, the last time we get to see them is in the Neo vs. Baine battle after which Neo is left in a very bad condition, so instead of showing us if the star is ok, they show us a bunch of extras getting killed by the Sentinels.. The last part of the film is the final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith... Only one word can describe this epic confrontation...WOW!! We get to see a fight that most clearly shows the  Anime influence of the films... And that's exactly what it is like, like those epic confrontations in say.. Dragonball (only that it doesn't last a couple of years and it doesn't have any fireballs...) The ending of the battle as well as the end of the movie will surely give birth to many theories and discussions between avid Matrix fans... In conclusion, probably the Matrix Revolutions will not be what you expect it to be... If you really want to enjoy the film leave all your expectations at home and when you judge it, don't do so as if it were a standalone movie but a part of a bigger movie, and if you look at it like that then surely you won't be disappointed.

  The Good News: 1. Special Effects. If you like them, this movie is full of them, and they do an incredible job with them. Basically, it boils down to your opinions on them, and since I think special effects are a growing and important 'revolution' in the film world, I support them, and was very impressed. 2. Carrying with the ideas from Reloaded, this movie ventures even further beyond the borders of the Matrix and brings us into the Machine World itself. Fantastic and unbelievable, maybe, but at least we get to see it. 3. Proof that Neo is the one! At last! We keep hearing ""the one, the one, the one"" and in both movies, he is an epitome of a succesful failure ... at last, he wins, and makes a big point of it! 4. Smith is a phenomenal villain ... starting from the bottom and becoming ultimately equal with Neo ... a well established villain, coming very close to the quality of my beloved Lord of the Rings films.<br/><br/>AND ... The Bad News<br/><br/>1. STILL STILL STILL a ton of unanswered questions ... I understand that mysteries have to linger, but if you are going to see this one (as I was) to get some answers to your ""Matrix Questions"", you will leave feeling unfulfilled, because some are answered, while others are introduced ... not to be judgemental, but it MAY be that the Wachowski's built a world too large to handle ... there is A LOT unanswered ... 2. What's the deal with the little girl? I mean, obviously she's 'good', but what is her purpose? Future Oracle? See Point number 1. 3. SUPERIOR FAILURE in not bringing back the following characters (or not bringing them back to a reasonable level of film-time); The Merovingian, Persephone, The Twins, and The Architect. 4. Would like to have seen more one-on-one fighting ... yes, the Zion scenes with thousands upon thousands of sentinels WAS VERY COOL ... but the Matrix gained its reputation through enhanced, visual representations of one-on-ones ... would like to have seen more ... <br/><br/>
 All in all, this movie gets an 8/10 ... how is this measured? Well, the goods and bads PROBABLY weigh each other out, giving it a 7 average (since anything under 4 is bad, an average movie gets a 7) ... therefore, the extra point is really gained because this movie is part of a trilogy that needs to be looked at, really, as one movie to be rated properly ... what does the Matrix trilogy get? An 8/10 ... with this movie being the middle - ground (better than Reloaded, worse than The Matrix) ... so, overall, I believe an 8/10 represents the true quality of both the film and the trilogy ... should you see it?

","The Matrix: a pumping action movie. Visually stunning. I had heard very little about the movie when I stepped into the theatre. Two hours later, it felt like some time had passed, but not ""earth time"", and definitely not ""two hours"". I had just witnessed ""The Matrix"", or ""The Matrix"" had run through me.. or something. :) Yes, yes, the greatest action movie ever made - no doubt. Btw: I just read a review claiming ""Die Hard"" as the best action movie ever made, which really makes me laugh. ""Die Hard"" and similar 80s/early 90s action movies are as close to this movie in the action genre as ""Troll 2"" is to ""Lord of the Rings"" in the fantasy genre..<br/><br/>Anyway, 3 minutes after seeing the movie - me and my girlfriend, moping around outside the theatre half speechless; I still remember that I actually said: ""they can just forget making a sequel to this"". I didn't know sequels were considered, I just figured a sequel would almost certainly be a anti-climax in comparison to this.<br/><br/>
Then, 3 years after: ""Matrix Reloaded"". I wouldn't admit right after seeing it that it was disappointing, but it was. A good film, yes, but completely void of what ""the Matrix"" had - without sting, without the attention to detail. Even though I'd said a sequel would fail anyway, I still felt it all crumble in front of me - like the Star Wars series, magnificent ""Matrix"" was being mishandled by it's creators.<br/><br/>Now, finally, ""Matrix Revolutions"". I went into the cinema with no expectations what so ever, the movie had really gotten a bad rep at IMDB and started out at a 6.7 rating, even rated below such completely talentless trash as Terminator 3.<br/><br/>I won't comment the content of this film in bigger words. I'll just say that I actually got that ""Matrix feeling"" again, the universe actually gripped me. That doomsday-mood, the environments. The attention to detail, the depiction of ""normal people"" from the Matrix, the innovative effect dynamics - the feeling of intelligent directors behind it all - it was back. I even felt that Neo and Trinity were in love for real - not kissing robots like in ""Reloaded"".<br/><br/>PS: Despite what everyone are saying, great acting by Keanu Reeves. I'm not one of his kiss-up fans or anything, but there's not much in this movie he could do better - or different - as the cyberpunk hacker he is indeed playing.<br/><br/>PSII: I almost got a feeling ""Reloaded"" was made tame on purpose, to take off some of the inevitable anti-climax effect from ""Matrix"", then release ""Revolutions"" shortly after so people would see it anyway.<br/><br/>
*MINI-SPOILERS - (these shouldn't ruin the film for you, but..) *<br/><br/>A couple of flaws - a far too long deathscene (you'll know which one) made an unworthy goodbye for a certain character. Also, The Oracle is played by a new actor, as the original (outstanding) actor has actually died. Although this is well built around in the story, it doesn't feel quite right. The Wachowskis did their best with this though.<br/><br/>*MINI-SPOILERS*<br/><br/>
Conclusion: There are obviously too many people visiting IMDB who just follow the mainstream. I guess the movie buffs who used to dominate this place have been outnumbered now, and IMDB has become a playground for every mainstream filmgoer without a clue about what a movie experience really is about.<br/><br/>Anyway, to me, ""The Matrix"" trilogy now feels completed, and unlike what I feared, I don't have to see the first movie as a separate chapter, as I've been partly forced to with the ""Star Wars"" series. I accept this ending, it feels whole. OK - as a separate movie, it's not as good as ""The Matrix"", and sadly, I guess few movies will be able to equal that as a movie experience. Still, ""Revolutions"" is a remarkable movie in the Matrix universe, far surpassing ""Reloaded"".<br/><br/>Higly recommended!!"

","The wait is finally over, the answers are in and the line is drawn, the big question being, was it worth the wait? The simple answer is that I'm not sure yet. I think I need to see the movie again to be fair, but for me, whilst I enjoyed the 128 minutes of movie and end credits even (well sitting and chatting with my mates while the the Gothicesque piece of music played), I just felt it was somewhat lacking.<br/><br/>The story begins exactly where we left it in Reloaded. Our heroes are aboard the Hammer one of only two human ships left after the failed defence against the sentinels. Neo lies unconcious in the medical unit along with Bane, the character copied over by Agent Smith within the matrix. The first 10 - 20 minutes then sets out to establish what devilry has befallen Neo and how he can be saved. <br/><br/>We end up in a S&M club where everyone is dressed in rubber and which is run by the French information trafficker the Merovingian. In order to save Neo, Morpheus and Trinity have gone there with Seraph the Oracle's guard on her advice. Without giving very much away they are able to save Neo, having first dealt with some of the Merovingian's men and survived a fairly amusing stand off. <br/><br/>I won't give any more of the plot away, suffice to say the heroes split up with Morpheus and the remaining crew of the Hammer, having meeting Niobe and her ship the Logos, heading back to Zion in the Hammer. Meanwhile Neo and Trinity take control of the Logos to help Neo fulfill his destiny. Where we end up is with an epic battle of Zion involving thousands of sentinels and many armoured mechanical walkers, as used by the defenders of Zion. While Neo engages in the mother of all fights with Agent Smith, as many of you may have gathered from the trailer there are a fair few of him, though the fight takes place with just the one.<br/><br/>Is all this enough then? Well I'd say no. The battle of Zion is incredible to watch and Neo/Smith round 3 is sometimes brutal and beautifully photographed. Unfortunately the philosophy of the previous films is more or less dispensed with in favour of a number of blockbuster cliches. We get the plucky kid who wants to do his bit, the heroic captain who 'will give em hell', and a bald headed heroine (don't actually remember what she was called) who turns up in the heat of the battle to...well that would be spoiling, but lets just say you can see it coming. Some of the dialogue could have come straight out of an 80s blockbuster, which considering the high brow appeal of the previous films is unfortunate at the least. I missed the talk and philosophy and felt many questions raised in Reloaded were just ignored.<br/><br/>The action isn't quite on a par with Reloaded's burly brawl, chateau fight and freeway chase, but stands above most blockbusters at any rate. Those scenes gave me an adrenaline rush that I never really felt here and just seemed so different.<br/><br/>Aside from those negative points though, what we have is an incredible looking film, that manages to satifactorily resolve the saga. The finale is epic, and the brothers use of extensive storyboarding is apparent throughout. Added to which Hugo Weaving's performance as Smith again dominates, setting some sort of new standard for bad guy cool. the movie ends in a surprisingly ambiguous manner, which I felt was appropriate and in line with Neo's closing speech to The Matrix. There are also some pleasingly symbolic moments.<br/><br/>Revolutions is a worthy conclusion to the Matrix trilogy, but not quite what I was hoping for. I'd say anyone who liked the other two will like it. Those who disliked Reloaded because of the philosophy may be swayed by the more direct approach. This is mainly one for the fans though, and many of us there are!"

While Morpheus and Trinity take measures to try and save him, the human inhabitants make preparations for what will be the final, all-out war against the machine empire to try and save Zion from total devastation. They must also contend with the maniacal, renegade Agent Smith who has grown so powerful that he poses an eminent threat to both the machines and humans. Like its predecessors it goes a long way on explosive, non-stop action and remarkable visual effects, but it's brought down by cheesy dialogue and a climax that doesn't pack quite the punch you'd hope for.

","The Wachowski Brothers created the original MATRIX and they've successfully ""destroyed"" it in this latest flick.  I saw Revolutions in Sydney at 1am in the morning on the opening day, having seen (yet again) the original Matrix and Reloaded just a few hours earlier. I purposely haven't read any reviews prior to the movie as I wanted to have few assumptions and so that it wouldn't affect my expectations. How wrong I was. I wish I'd read all the other reviewers comments and didn't waste my time seeing this movie at all! As the Architect said in Reloaded: ""...The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being..."". To use this analogy, one could say that the original Matrix movie was ""naturally perfect, flawless, sublime"". However, the Wachowski brothers are only human beings... They've successfully managed to achieve such a monumental failure which they've called Revolutions. This trilogy could have been a work of art, a triumph. Yet its fallen to just another sci-fi movie level. Not only has this failure affected this latest movie, it has even managed to lower my regard for the previous two movies in the series. I was really looking forward to buying the Matrix DVD trilogy when it will come out next year. Not any more..<br/><br/>I really wish that all of you readers pay attention to so many other user comments expressing a monumental disappointment and that you don't even bother seeing this film. It will spoil the experience of the first two films in the trilogy. Therefore if you take my advice, the following comments won't even be called ""Spoilers"": The movie just went down hill from the ""train"" scene. Why didn't they use the matrix within a matrix theory? It would have explained so many theories. This movie hasn't explained as much as it should have. I really wish they've spent more time on explanations rather than on mindless fighting scenes. Why didn't they use the potential of these great actors that they've hired such as Monica Bellucci? She only got a one-liner! What happened to the great speeches of the previous movies? They were simply flat here. Why did they waste so much time on a few different love stories. None of them were really that convincing. What happened to the Oracle? The original Oracle was a pleasure to watch. Instead this ""replacement"" actor was as much of a let down as the rest of this movie. I could go on and on but this movie is seriously not worth any more of my time."

What if what you thought was real was actually an illusion? Would you abandon your comfortable 'fake' life to fight for 'freedom'?.<br/><br/>This first Matrix set this up beautifully and the second explored it further.  Along the way we got some great looking effects and fight scenes, the result being an exciting and slightly more cerebral SF movie than we're used to.<br/><br/>Well I can tell you, this recipe is almost totally abandoned and what we get is your standard action movie Hollywood has been churning out for years. Gone is any thought, and the CGI is heaped on by the ton.  Don't get me wrong, it looks great, and as action movies go it's a step above, but I've come to expect more from this franchise.<br/><br/>Perhaps they should have stopped at the first Matrix.  I suppose the lure of $$$ is too much, however, so we get this unworthy conclusion that smacks of being hastily done.

I still would recommend this movie to people who have seen the other two, but by itself, this movie was poor and think that the creators could have made a more dramatic conclusion.

But another part of me wanted to movie simply to be good.  It fulfilled the former (how could it do otherwise?) but it was less than successful on the later.<br/><br/>The first half hour was unnecessarily drawn out exposition with little intrigue or twists to keep you engaged.  Here the ""twins"" from ""Matrix-Reloaded"" would have been a welcome and familiar diversion.  But by the time the action started I was way too antsy and ready for something.<br/><br/>The next hour or so was almost overload.  For the me it felt more like an over-the-top video game than an action movie.  The swirling movement of literally thousands of real-world machines was incredible.  But because of their sheer numbers you could never focus on any one thing for too long. I kept thinking more about what impressive computers they used to create the scene than in the plight of the Zion inhabitants.<br/><br/>By contrast to the approach George Lucas used in the Star Wars films - where he kept cutting between action along several fronts (think the climatic battles in ""Return of the Jedi"" and ""The Phantom Menace"") this one remained tightly focused on one for, what was for me, too long.  Some might say this gave each conflict its due.  For me it was too much without a breather.<br/><br/>In the end the resolution was less than satisfying.  Neo's encounter with the embodiment of the Source reminded me more of the John Ratzenberger-voiced school of fish in ""Finding Nemo"" than anything else. And his final encounter with Agent Smith caused more chuckles than ooohs... I'm not sure that's what they intended.<br/><br/>And though I understand the finale to a trilogy like this might prefer to leave many specifics unspecified, I would've liked a broader glimpse of the world as it was at the film's conclusion.<br/><br/>I wish could rate it higher, but I can't.  This is a movie that will only be of interest to fans of the first two.  Without having seen them, the story's worthless.

I'm saddened to announce to fans the last two movies have been made to capitalize on the unexpected popularity of the first. If you're expecting an ending with a bang, prepare yourself for a mild sizzle. There is NOTHING innovative about this movie (except the marketing that went into the hype). Sure there were good action sequences that wows you superficially. It helped immensely that I watched it on a 8 story IMax screen. The fact remains the story was weak at best. I'm left feeling so empty. I didn't care about the characters like I should have. Merovingian character could have potentially developed into a key role. Wasted. Bane's potential. Wasted.

","Plain and simple. After being devastated by Reloaded, all my instincts were telling me not to even give this one a fighting chance, but I did...and what happened?  Once again I was left hanging in the abyss. However, a few things did put this one above Reloaded at least in my mind. For starters, the dialogue, although sporadic and over philosophical at times, was definitely not as cheesy, and the action scenes were not completely overblown.  The majority of the film was plot-driven with little or no gratuitous action, but unfortunately the plot alone was not enough to drive this one home. The pacing was definitely where the film struggled the most, but after watching it in its entirety you realize that its struggles spread far beyond that. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the action for the most part, but by the end, for those of us that had been following the plot since the first film, or what was left of it, it became clear that there may never have been one; like I said, ""utterly disappointing"". Once again it becomes apparent that the Wachowski Bros. are the ones stuck in a matrix; the matrix of Hollywood commercialism, where artistry and originality are sliced and diced and spoon-fed to the masses at double the price. What were they thinking?  They were definitely thinking very green.

","Reloaded had its problems, so having been shot back to back this was bound to have certain problems too. Not so much similar problems in this instalment, whereas Reloaded essentially forgot that the first movies philosophical and religious reference was in subtle sub text, Reloaded brought it to the forefront of the movie in a rather ostentatious manner. The pacing and the dialogue was also a problem. In Revolutions however there are still problems with pacing and even more so with dialogue but there is a lot less philosophising.<br/><br/>The two sequels essentially take on a hole different tone to the first movie. They don't feel like the same movie. When watching the first film there is no way of guessing where the next two will take the story and characters. It is quite an imaginative and at times exciting journey but understandable that many fans don't feel satisfied. The Matrix had one of those great endings leaving it wide open for another but looking back now having seen the two sequels I feel it would have been better off as a stand alone film, I mean much as I would love to see a continuation of Blade Runner it is a film that is best as a film of its own. What it boils down to in some ways is that the story the Wachowski's are trying to tell in the final two instalments are very complex ideas, essentially twice as much movie material than the running times of both together. It feels way to much like the two sequels have crammed information in, they've been cramming so much into the films, and the game and the Animated films, yet still the explanations need such time for the audience to fully understand that come the resolution of the final chapter you still feel you don't now enough about the Matrix, the relationship between the humans and the machines, Neo's purpose, Agent Smith's role and purpose, the Oracle. You get a basic gist of most of it but you never quite feel satisfied enough about certain characters roles, objectives and so on.<br/><br/>These are the major gripes but at the end of the day the two sequels are still enjoyable action movies, they do have their slow points but then most action films do. The action is still fantastic. This has the awe factor of the second but this time I felt more emotionally involved. The battles in Zion are amazing, great displays of CGI. The CGI in this film is superb. The level of detail is amazing, the Machines city is particularly jaw dropping. Also the much touted super brawl between Smith and Neo is something to behold. There is no doubt that while the Wachowski's have had problems with the scripts of the last two they have not lost their visual style and their unique imagination. The fight that ends the trilogy is perhaps the best, it is not as emotionally involving as the fights in the first film due to story and character problems but for sheer spectacle they are astounding. The fight reminiscent of Dark City's final showdown but on acid, is just very exciting not to mention the fact that it really does look cool.<br/><br/>The cast are good although for about a third of the movie Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss disappear from the film while the battle of Zion takes place. Reeves is more than ever a little bit wooden but Laurence Fishbourne is back on form from the last film. Also Jada Pinkett Smith has a much better role than the last film too and she is looking very sexy. Also Ian Bliss is excellent as Bane, his impersonation of Agent Smith is superb. Of course the man himself Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving steals the show. On a minor point Monica Bellucci is sadly wasted in a very brief one line role, although she does stick in the mammary, I mean memory for other reasons, I nearly shouted out `Holy Wazoombas Batman!' in the cinema, thankfully I didn't.<br/><br/>Despite some flaws and the feeling it has been needless, I liked the much debated resolution to the story, and there were shocks in it and deaths for two major characters. I just wish I was 100% clear about the whole trilogy, I imagine the only ones to fully grasp everyone that has happened or been implied would be the writers themselves. It seems in some ways the two sequels are just too big, they seem so different from the subtle and self contained original. To sum up the original to me is endlessly repeatable and can be read in so many different ways, thanks to the intelligent scripting, while the sequels are good, they have some depth but the way the stories are told in two and three are problematic and the films will not be anywhere near as repeatable. Overall this is a good cinema going experience but still in the context of the first movie, sadly lacking. ***"

","I had to drop a quick note and say that ""Matrix Revolutions""  was pretty frustrating. For someone who has a DEEP admiration for the Wachowski brothers, I thought it was kind of anti-climactic. And the dialogue was very bad in some parts. One of the great things about the first movie was how cool the dialogue was. It was fresh. ""Revolutions"" was just boring. The lines between Neo and Trinity are corny as hell. ""I love you honey!!"" ""No, I love you more!!!!"" Pretty bad.  But I have to disagree with 'iwatcheverything.' I don't think there needed to be more action, and less talk. I think there was some great action. But the dialogue needs to be KICKSTARTED. Seriously, who has the jumper cables? Still, it was a kickass movie. I'm frustrated, but I definitely enjoyed the movie. The battle scenes were amazing. But it didn't have the spark of the first one. Still, go see it!!!! Its definitely a movie for the theatres. Ken"

Anyone expecting to get a repeat of the first movie should be classified as delusional. There was so much back story that had to be told and so much storyline that needed to be set-up that they were going to be different animals to the original.<br/><br/>The third has more action and fun stuff which was all good and a great ending that doesn't close the door on the story.

","Is it just me, or did this trilogy take a really christian turn at the end.  I just watched the movie about an hour ago and I came out of the theatre saying, ""Wow, I really need to read the bible.""  To me it seemed like I Just kept getting slapped in the face with blatant christian symbolism.  By the time the movie ended, I wondered if i had just taken in a fun sci-filosophy flick or some kind of born again christian allegory. Ok here are some of the example's i thought of.  First of all there's the whole savior thing which is obvious.  It doesn't take much to realize that Neo is a christ figure.  But that in itself is not where it gets to the level of smack-you-over-the-head-with-a-sack-of-bibles-obvious. I mean Jesus (no pun intended). Any good hero has attributes of the archetypal mythic hero, which christ was.  But then there's the whole free will thing.  When Smith asks Neo why he keeps fighting when his demise seems eminent, Neo's response basically echoes Milton's message in Paradise lost about what makes human beings human and why their fall was ""fortunate"": Free Will.  Ok... you're still not convinced, how about the whole light/slash dark thing when Smith and Neo subsume one another.  Neo is symbolically manifested as light, Smith dark.  ""I am the light of the world"" anyone?  Not to mention Neo appears as some sort of beatific shepard-guiding star and the end of the movie.  Still not convinced?  How about the fact that Smith and Neo's final battle occurs in the middle of a teeming rainstorm, that is, a biblical deluge, or better yet, a Baptism.  And if you need stark old testament style/cheesy religious film evidence, there's always Agent smith (satan) cackeling demonically as lightning crashes in the background.  Oh, and one more thing.  Neo, in greek, the language of the bible means ""new"".  Is it just me or could this be a reference to the new testament? The testament that deals with Christ. Oh yeah, and he's fighting to save Zion a.k.a Jerusalem in ancient times. Maybe im just reading into the whole good vs. evil thing, which has been done before, for example in the works of Tolkien where it resulted in general crappiness.  I am not geneally one to ascribe religious allegory but it just seemed to apparent to pass up this time."

This movie had the most astounding graphics out of the newly found trilogy, and was built from the ground up to be the best in the collection. I concur. This movie edges out The original by small step, and the second movie by a giant Leap. I'm not saying Reloaded was bad by any means, but, just as in The Holy Trilogy, there has to be something to drop your gaurd, and hope, for a far more ""Inevitable"" reality to become true.<br/><br/>Much like Reloaded, There are two climax's. During the movie, I thought this hurt it, but as I think more, I realize it actually made the film, rather than break it.<br/><br/>You still see the whole ""I love you, I want you, I'll do anything for you blah blah blah"" between Neo and Trinity. This also leads to other things, and much the same as why it can not end any other way.<br/><br/>To go into any more detail, I'd have to spoil the movie. And I'm not going to do that.

","First off, I absolutely loved the first Matrix. After being somewhat disappointed with The Matrix: Reloaded however, I went into this movie with a ""let's get this over with"" attitude. I was terribly mistaken. Revolutions had better action and a more interesting plot than Reloaded! I dare say that it was as good as the first!<br/><br/>Punch: I was disappointed by the special effects of Reloaded. It seemed like a feeble attempt to squeeze what was left of bullet-time into another movie. Revolutions' special effects on the other hand, were absolutely mind-blowing! Hand-to-hand combat sequences were done superbly and just as memorably as they had been in the first (with new twists of course). The war scenes were done in great detail and were quite suspenseful. This is just what we needed after the disappointing Reloaded!<br/><br/>Plot: I was left confused by the open ending of Reloaded, and feared that even after watching Revolutions once, I'd still be confused. I was pleased to find the plot was explained in full detail by the end of the movie. I also found the plot much more interesting than that of Reloaded for two reasons. First, there was a much greater sense of urgency to save Zion. Second, Neo and Trinity's love is actually shown in this movie. and it's believable!<br/><br/>Summary: Killer action, riveting plot, worth every penny I spent seeing it in the theater!<br/><br/>10/10"
"mongoose221","8","0","0","5 November 2003"," Blew me out of the water, but NOT for everybody *possible small spoiler*
","First let me give you some of my thoughts on the previous Matrix movies. After seeing the first Matrix, and absolutely loving it, I was extrememly excited for Matrix: Reloaded...too bad I was severly let down. Never in my life had I felt so unfulfilled after seeing a movie, and never in my life had I wanted a refund. When I went back and watched it later, I realized I had bashed it too much, but in the end it was barely more than 2 1/2 out of 5 stars.<br/><br/>Now, when I went to see Revolutions, I was hoping that it would make up for the total mishap that Reloaded was. I must say that I was very very pleased with this movie, BUT not everybody will be. My two roommates absolutely hated it *although one LOVED reloaded...go figure eh?* Personally I loved it because the Zion battle scene was the most stunning battle I have ever seen on the screen. It was an opera of fluid, overblown, explosive joy. The final fight between Neo and Agent Smith was sweet also, but it couldn't stand up to the Zion fight scene. Im a big fan of SciFi wars, and especially one's involving 'Mechs. Mechassault on Xbox, and the Mechwarrior franchise on the PC are some of my favorite games, and I have been dying for something in their ilk to make its way to the big screen. Honestly, I would have paid to see a 3 hour APU battle for all I cared, but hey that's just me, and that is where the problem within this movie lies. NOT EVERYBODY WHO LIKED THE FIRST ONE, or even the second one for that matter, will enjoy this movie. If you are looking for another 'KungFu Fest' like reloaded, look elsewhere. If you are looking for more psychobabble and deliberate plot nuances, look elsewhere. If you want to see the most bada**, over the top, operatic, and well put together SciFi war seqence, then this is it! I must say if you are a fan of 'Mech combat then this movie will definitely be for you, if not, then I must say proceed with caution. While utterly and completely possible to love this movie without a knowledge or love for 'Mechs and robotic combat, it will be very rare to find somebody, ESPECIALLY somebody who dislikes that and is looking for KungFu and 'Gun Opera' battles, to find much pleasure in this movie.<br/><br/>So there you have it, hopefully without too many spoilers, my review of Matrix Revolutions.<br/><br/>for a fan of SciFi, Mech/Robot battles----> 10 out of 10 for a fan of the kungfu of the other Matrix's----> 6 out of 10 for a casual fan just wanting an action movie----> 7.5 out of 10<br/><br/>so in the end, I felt it redeemed the franchise, my friend said he wont buy the DVD set in the future due to this movie, so again, if you dislike mech/robot combat steer away from this one. anybody else, this is a fitting end to a GREAT starting trilogy, which faltered in the middle, but regained its composure for the final installment."

","Let me just start off by saying I HATE movie critics...  that being said, I loved this movie!<br/><br/>You may see others say that the dialouge was bad, that the effects were so-so, and that there was too much drama, etc etc.  Well, I have to say that the first movie in this series is the best by far... it was original both in plot and in the new special effects.  Though I liked Reloaded, I still had a hard time with following parts of the plots, and there were points when even I could see some flaws in the CGI (the Agent Smiths vs. Neo was most noticable.)<br/><br/>I came into Revolutions with high expectations and with hope for an entertaining, action-packed closure, and that's exactly what I got.  They didn't dilude the movie with old effects (i.e.- excessive bullet time use, etc.)  It was refreshing to me that so little time was spent in the matrix in this movie...  the first two movies for the most part, took place in the matrix.  Seeing the ins and outs of the ""real world"" was excellent!<br/><br/>Plot-wise, I have heard that there was bad acting and too much talking, not enough action...  I beg to differ as I felt that there were so many loose ends to tie up, there was a great balance of dialouge and action.  The machines vs. Zion scene was both action-packed and stunning to watch from an effects point of view.  Neo vs. Smith was done in a way that I think was tailored away from the classic fighting scenes.   The leader of the machine world was just an amazing job, the effects on him alone made the ending that much better!<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, I was left thinking about all that just took place. I got my closure, but I am still trying to figure out what it all meant... it leaves a lot of thinking to do.  If you watch the first two movies, then see this, you will do yourself a favor as there are many hints and references to the first two plots.  I am going to go see this movie again tomorrow to take my fiancee (she was working tonight) and also so I can try and process the whole movie again.  If I spend two trips to the theater to see a movie, then it's DEFINATELY my cup of tea.<br/><br/>Try not to go into this movie looking to pick it apart, and just enjoy the excellent entertainment of it for ___'s sake!"

","**Warning, spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>You know, it's after movies like this that I shake my head and think to myself, ""What the HELL were they thinking?!""  The Matrix Revolutions is so stuck in its own contrived and pretentious self-importance, that the writer/director duo apparently forgot about everything that made the first movie such a brilliant piece of work such as CHARACTERS and PLOT.  How about instead of wooden caricatures that talk like something out of a bad Star Trek episode, you give us people interesting enough for us to actually care about?  Morpheus, Trinity, and Agent Smith, are barely given any screen time, for example.  Most of the movie focuses on the main battle between the machines and the humans, but, get this, not a SINGLE SOLITARY main character even takes part in the battle!  By the time the embarrassing conclusion rolled along, I wanted to cry.  This ending is so laughably conceived, so pathetically executed, that it had me looking back on the second installment of the Matrix series with fond memories.  If you know the story of Jesus, you know how this movie turns out.  The directors even went so far as to put Keanu Reeves in a cruciform position with a melodramatic latin chorus blaring distractingly in the background -- I almost halfway expected to see fanatical survivors running around screaming and yelling about the soon to come rapture and return of their ""savior.""  This movie will be no doubt compared to classics such as ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Star Wars,"" and ""Lord of the Rings.""  All of them follow the same archetype.  The difference is that where others succeeded, this one fails miserably.  How would you feel if at the end of Star Wars, instead of Luke defeating his father and having the emperor killed, instead of the Death Star being blown up, instead Luke ""sacrificed himself"" for the rebellion, and in turn the emperor said ""ok, I guess I'll leave you guys alone now"" and the Death Star went away and never bothered anybody again?  Yeah, that's how I felt at the end of this movie. This never should have been a trilogy.  The first movie was good enough. Now, because of this debacle of a film, its legacy will be forever tainted.

","I wanted to like this SO much, I wanted this to make up for Reloaded's ponderous dialogue and underwhelming fights. However, Revolutions is unspectacular, incoherent and an utterly unsatisfying way to end the trilogy.<br/><br/>Following on directly from Reloaded's ""cliffhanger"" ending (note:sarcasm), we find Neo alone, disconnected in a way that doesn't seem to make any sense within the structure of the film. Trinity et al. track him down, in what is probably the most entertaining section of the film. Then, he has a bit of contemplation, involving more pseudo-philosophy from the Oracle, then decides to go it alone to Machine Land.<br/><br/>Oh yes, meanwhile, Zion is under attack. What is supposed to be the spectacular centrepiece of Revolutions is a cheesy, cliched, run-of-the-mill action movie, where the impressive special effects manage to generate zero excitement. Let's face it, we only really care about our central trio of characters, and we'd rather see Zion reduced to a crumbling wreck as long as Morpheus, Trinity and Neo make it out OK.<br/><br/>Neo's final fight with Smith is good in parts, but didn't we all prefer it when it had an element of believability? They may be flying through the night sky but compare it to the Subway fight in the first Movie and it lacks all of the flair of choreography and direction, it lacks the gritty violence, and it lacks any sense of compassion for Neo, or triumph at the end. And the robot face that represents the machine consciousness in the real world? Where did all the Wachowski's IDEAS go?<br/><br/>The first film was like a band's first album - all those concepts that have been formulating in the mind for years, waiting for the chance to show people their incredible visions. The two sequels are crippled by that first success, feeling like committee-written excuses to show how much money can be spent and made in one go.<br/><br/>Not worth waiting four years for."

","Thank Christ I was too busy to look at anything about the film before I was sat there watching it, given reports of negative reviews (I never listen to critics anymore, I can make up my own mind and everyone's a critic with the Internet now!) It does come across as the other half from Reloaded, the fight scenes invoking elements and memories of all three parts of the trilogy while adding their own strand at the same time.<br/><br/>Suffice to say that there are only two really ugly cliched moments that stand out and took me out of the film and luckily they were followed by action scenes to quickly get me back. Unlike LXG and Star Wars Clones, the fight scene that looks like a computer game in Revolutions is still enjoyable to watch, and CGI does not cheat you out of seeing great close-up action and death. If they got this scene right as a videogame then it would be the best sci-fi co-op first person action title since Serious Sam 1 and 2. Sadly you'll have to watch the film to get my meaning, no spoilers as promised!<br/><br/>Mary Alice, replacing the late Gloria Foster as The Oracle was spookily accurate with the voice- unless it was the original actress dubbed onto hers. Good touch and good acting however they did it.<br/><br/>This is the ""Return Of The Jedi"" kind of sequel- but with sentimentality taking the place of the Ewoks. Then again if your world was in danger of ending, lots of trite human emotions are probably what you'd come out with. It's mostly tighter, not strolling around in love with its own intellectual self-satisfaction as much as Reloaded.<br/><br/>The final fight has shades of Kill Bill in its styling, which I'm sure is accidental, or a result of QT's devotion to Hong Kong/Asian action cinema.- or just Yuen Wo Ping's general genius. Nice move anyway.

Just see it, IMO it defies commonsense not to round off the series. I think it's great, and will probably catch it a couple more times on my UGC Subscription Card because that would make it free to me after the second viewing (in the UK). Even if you hate it, these are big-screen movies, so see them where you'll enjoy them best.

Don't get me wrong, the action to the second movie was great, but I could care less about the whole 45 min it took to explain the problems of Zion. Matrix Revolutions, started off way to slow for me, and the real part (action) of the movie didn't really start until half an hour into the film, at that point I was half asleep out of bordeem.  I have seen biographies that have been more captivating than the first part of the movie.  A few new special effects were added to the film to try to cover the holes in the plot.  I truly feel it would have been better if Warner Bros would have combined Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions into one longer movie instead of providing us with two films that were only okay.

I will give it a plus for effects, but great effects alone, does not a great movie make. Honestly, I think they should re-think the Revolutions movie, maybe come out with #4 then give everyone who went to #3 a free pass to it, I was very disappointed with the ending, I think there were several usable story directions they could have gone in that would have answered more questions, but they seemed to end up on the cutting room floor."

They put everything on the trailer, so there was almost anything new, anything you could say ""oh my god!!!""

I however believe that a movie should be more then that. The sound track was also good, if I has listening to it without having to endure the movie itself.<br/><br/>On the negative side: The fight scenes were not really special. Matrix part I & II have way, way better fight scenes. But if you want fight scene you have to go to the source which is not located in the States or Europe but in the Far East. Then there was a lot on touchy-feelly scenes which were irritating, since the sorry couldn't really support them. The acting wasn't bad, but wasn't anything special. Poor story/plot (if you can even call it a plot), somehow the Wachowski managed to (more or less) remove the most interesting antagonists from the movie.<br/><br/>The Wachowski brothers started out by making a extremely good movie, and then continued to beat their money horse till it died and then continued beating it. Revolutions was in MY opinion a waste of time and money, and every thing after part I was just a way of making money, and had nothing to do with movie-making.<br/><br/>So in conclusion: If you thought theat part II was a disappointment, then spare yourself the pain of seeing part III."

","First off I wouldn't say Revolutions is a bad move, it's an average movie. What makes it bad is it belongs to a trilogy that opened with an amazing movie The Matrix. The Matrix opened up an amazing world for fans, drawing on what appeared to be the sense of self doubt in all of humanity.  The Animatrix continued on to explain the unexplainable, Déjà vu, hallucinations, ghosts and hauntings.   Reloaded continues in this vein decently presenting even stronger religious symbolism and eastern philosophies , yes there are people who disagree, yet the redeeming quality of Reloaded was any unanswered questions would be closed in Revolutions. Revolutions fails this task horribly.  Instead we are presented with more questions, (Why would a program born of two programs have to get into the Matrix? How does a place exist somewhere outside of the Matrix and outside of reality, and why do we present it if we're going to spend all of ten minutes there?). Instead the Wachowski brothers take us on scenes designed to simply take up film such as Club Hell. Where we witness a twisted repeat version of the Zion celebration without any apparent meaning other than to show off flesh in leather.  (Who's being divorced because of S&M and cross-dressing?).<br/><br/>We move from there to have a high speed Mechwarrior movie that's too fast to follow and where every secondary character runs into every other one to make some grand life giving sacrifice, three times over.  Neo, in his new role as Paul in Herbert's Messiah, decides to have the final showdown where low and behold, all those non-Christian tie ins that have been flaunted, well those were just glamour's, instead Neo proves to us in blinding white orange light that Jesus was just version .83 The overall problem with the series is we've been presented with a plot that shows remarkable presentation of detail, to the point where everyone watching is asking right along with Neo `Why?' only to have all those questions if not ignored, disregarded with a shrug by the Architect a member of a race of machines that can kill, think, love, but yet not lie.  There are those who will argue that it's an action movie just there for high flying kicks and fun.  If that's the case, the series should have omitted `Wake up Neo' and just closed with the first movie."

","I walked out of the theatre stunned. I had gone in without high expectations, but in no way did I expect Revolutions to be as bad as it turned out to be. I mean, literally, they took the easiest possible solution for all of the problems and paradoxes they had created in Reloaded, and just let it sit with that. There was not a single clever move in the entire movie. It was like watching somebody set up a series of interesting puzzles, and then ""solve"" them by just smashing them to bits and saying, ""Well, the puzzles no longer exist, do they? Thus they are solved.""<br/><br/>I still can't believe it. There was so much possibility at the end of Reloaded. They opened so many doors and left things in such a state that we could have been in for the same big surprises and mind benders the first movie held. Instead, it was all about smashing things.<br/><br/>I left wishing that this was somehow a big joke, that a week from now the brothers will pop up and say, ""ha ha, your reality has been foiled, now here is the real version."" Then I realize what an awfully expensive joke that would be and sigh resigned. This truly is the way it is going to end, and that's that.<br/><br/>So what made Revolutions such a stinker other than the above? Well they still can't direct a love scene, period. Every time Neo and Trinity were about to kiss, it was as if they had both been stabbed in the back and were still in shock as they mechanically, almost corpselike, clutched at each other. Watching them try to kiss was the most frightening thing this halloween.<br/><br/>You know, I just don't even have the energy to finish this. If this were any other movie than the third installment of the Matrix, I would have just scored it low and forgotten about it. See it if you wish to, there are some neat special effects, but you'll probably end up wishing you never saw it, and that you could erase all of the cheap endings from your memory -- and somehow go on believing that the mysteries in Reloaded and the original are yet unsolved, complex, and introspective riddles."

Underneath I think it is about man's purpose.  Every speech that the antagonist Smith gave was about his failure to understand what drives man. Every computer program has a purpose, a meaning.  Does every man have a meaning? Why do we get up in the morning; what drives us to live.  Why do we get scared when our lives are threatened?  What makes us protective of life?  Is it Love?  Neo had one love, Trinity.  Trinity was killed.  What drove Neo after that?  After Smith had given Neo an old fashioned butt whuping, after it was obvious he couldn't beat Smith, After his only love Trinity had been killed, Neo persists.  Smith can't understand it.  ""Why Mr. Anderson, Why, Why do you persist?  Ask yourself, why would you persist.  That is the question this movie is trying to provoke.  The movie was about man's (Neo) struggle (Agent Smith) with finding the purpose of life.  After seeing the climatic battle sequence, I would say the Wachowski's think that man's struggle with the meaning of life is quite epic.

I'm not going to spoil the movie for everyone, but let's just say the brothers set the whole story up to be resolved and we just don't get it.  No clear resolution, though we do get the unsatisfying and overly cheesey deaths of two main characters.  The ending is just ridiculous...it ends with the line ""I always believed...."" and fades into the sunshine...so lame. Even the fight scenes were lacking...not interesting at all.

Furthermore, Matrix Revolutions is a lousy love story! All of a sudden everybody love each other.. Morpheus used to be SO cool -now he's just this pathetic cry-baby. And Trinity.. Well, she should have died in Reloaded so her death was very hard to take seriously. Where I watched it people were actually laughing during her death scene.. It was a joke.

","I have not been so dissapointed in a long time.  This movie was so far departed from the first two, it was almost a new film, not the end of a trilogy.  Several things were wrong, in my opinion. First, Neo was in less than half of the movie.  The fight between the humans and the machine for the dock in Zion was cool, but it was the best scene in the movie.  It should have been a side plot, a short scene.  There were none of the kung fu fighting scenes that practically defined the first two films. Neo spent the whole film becoming more and more Christlike, to Smith's Satan(duh!); do we really need the imagery pounded home so bluntly? Secondly, Smith, by far the best character, was also conspicuously absent. He became so interesting and entertaining in the second flick, now he is just a typical bad guy on a power trip. Lastly, nothing is really resolved.  The machines and the matrix go on, who is to say with Neo gone they don't break the peace after three days? Why was Neo the one?  Cause he chose to be?  Give me a fu#$ing break. Why did the Oracle try to help them?  How did the Merovingian ever become a power?  And lastly, how p-whipped was Morpheus by Will Smith's wife? If he gets bossed around like that, what chance do the rest of us have? <br/><br/>Bottom line- If I want some kind of an ethical, religious, morality,or spiritual lesson, I will go to church.  The Wachowskis really dropped the ball here, I should have stayed home and watched the second one on DVD, I'd be less bitter.  Great boob job on Persephone, though."

","I was thoroughly satisfied with Matrix Revolutions.  It didn't blow me away like the first one, but it didn't leave a bad taste in my mouth like the second one did.  In fact the way it resolved made the second one a better movie overall.  It was the way the story had to end, and it ended well.  The special effects were the best yet, the story was good, and the battles were intense.  This was the battle I was waiting for since I saw the end of the first one.  It did not disappoint at all.  But it wasn't perfect.  There weren't as many great moments as the first.  Great little moments, like the little conversation with Mouse at dinner, or great big moments, like Neo awakening for the first time, or when he realises he is the One.  There were a few great big moments, but it's not as rewatchable as the first.  Also, I miss the original oracle.  The new actress does a decent enough job, but it just wasn't the same.  Still that's no ones fault, but a shame nonetheless.<br/><br/>
spoiler <br/><br/>Most importantly they did not cop out and take the whole ""Real World is part of the matrix"" route, which was hinted at in the second one.  That would have ruined the whole story.  Instead they chose to end it the way it should have ended, with some interesting twists to boot.  But I'll let you see it for yourself.  Great movie, go see it."

","I have written several reviews of various films on the imdb database. Some long, some short.  On this occasion, moderately short.  Why? Well there isn't much to talk about because this is the worst episode out of all three. The first Matrix movie made ground breaking history, the action was great and the storyline kept the film moving. Reloaded was a nice middle sequence with superb effects when introduced to Zion and the freeway action scenes was second to none.  Revolutions - Well I though there would be a revolution in the cinema at the end as most people walked out saying how disappointing it was.  Why? Well no storyline, hardly any matrix style slowdown fighting scenes compared to 1 & 2 and it left so many questions unanswered and the ending was so open to any fourth edition.  Some characters were just thrown into the confusion possible due to the Brothers having some extra cash to throw away, come on who the hell was the woman firing the futuristic missile launchers at the diggers??? What is the point of her?  The plus point of the whole movie was seeing those blown up ED209's (sorry I have forgotten the correct name for them) blow the c**p outta the sentinels.  Those fighting machines rock big time.  Out of all 3 movies - the first matrix is still the best by far.  I did feel this was going to be a big film, and yes it will make alot of money but I reckon majority of us will say it's the worst out of all three!  Maybe people will talk about it for a few weeks but when the final Lord Of The Rings is out in December Matrix Revolutions will be quietly swept under the carpet!!  4/10"

","and I'd just like to  say that people who enjoyed this movie shouldn't either. This movie is just so densely packed with so much that there is nothing you can do to make harsh critics see it your way. So i won't even bother writing a review.<br/><br/>Hey, critics were thumbing their nose at the first one! I've seen all three and I've learned ALMOST all I wanted to know about the world of the Matrix. Hopefully, there will be anime/animation or comic books made to fill in some gaps.<br/><br/>I will say one negative thing about this movie. It goes from 0-200 just like Reloaded went from 0-60 without apology. This movie is extremely involved graphics-wise, so people who want a majority of human elements might be turned off. It's about 60-70% CGI and 30% explanation.<br/><br/>I do not feel ashamed or stupid for loving this trilogy. At the very least it will spawn some really cool video games for me to play!"
"Newtie33","Null","0","0","7 November 2003"," Disappointment
","That's about the only word I can use to describe this movie.  When I first saw the Matrix I was a senior in high school and it was by far the coolest movie I had ever seen.  Not the best, the coolest.  When Reloaded came out, I was pretty stoked and wasn't disappointed because I felt it was the best of the three.  SPOILERS!!!  Knowing how it ends, I really don't ever want to watch any of them again because I know how it all ends and what a sucky ending it was.  Absolutely no resolution whatsoever.  A couple of the storylines in this one were pretty good and Agent Smith was pretty damn cool but man did this movie suck.  I commend the W. Brothers for taking a risk in making an ending that didn't have Gary Cooper ride off into the sunset with Grace Kelly but what a tease this trilogy was.  I guess I just have to have a little bit more closure, cheesy or not.  It would be nice to think that people could appreciate a movie that has everyone holding hands in the end but I just didn't expect that from this story.  However, you could say that the ending was consistent with where the plot was headed so it really couldn't have ended any other way.  It just sucked how it ended. Boring.<br/><br/>Anyone that has seen the first two should most likely see this one but I suggest you don't get your hopes up because I did and was severely disappointed.  As far as movies go, it really wasn't done that poorly and the visual effects were good all around.  There are also a lot of good characters that get overshadowed by the poor acting of some of the key ones. Had this movie stood alone, could have gotten a greater review from me but we all know it doesn't make sense without the other two and unfortunately doesn't compare to the other two and leaves the story right where it picked it up.  4/10."

"bobby_horsepower","Null","0","0","7 November 2003"," A great big trilogy ends with a great big ""huh?"" *spoilers herein*
","The Matrix Revolutions is a very, very detailed and fast moving movie.  Only the most attentive and observant movie watchers will come out of this movie with a positive opinion.  And I'm guessing that since most of the general public can't rise above the Architect speech at the end of Reloaded, that would explain Revolutions's low imdb score.....<br/><br/>When I came out of the theatre after Revolutions was finished, I was a bit confused.  Sure, Revolutions has some great action set ups I admit.  The Smith/Neo fight and the ""battle for zion"" were all astounding and really make this movie worth watching even if you don't know what's going on.  If you closely look at the mechs you can actually make out individual scratches on the metal as they fight.  Now THAT'S some good CGI.  Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith turns in his best performance out of the 3 movies, and (gasp) we even see Keanu Reeves express some emotions in this movie.  <br/><br/>
However, despite all this, Revolutions will disappoint most because it leaves too many things up in the air for the audience to ""assume"".  Things aren't spelled out for us like in the first 2 movies.  Or, at the very least, spelled out so enough for us to understand the current scene. <br/><br/>
In the first matrix movie, we had Morpheus explain the nature of the matrix and the real world very effectively.  In reloaded, we had the Oracle expand the ideas and purposes of the matrix before the burly brawl which was all followed by the stupefying Architect explanation towards the end.<br/><br/>In revolutions, there was nothing.  Most of the plot is left to assumption, which is bad because not everyone may assume the same thing. <br/><br/>
When the Architect met up with the Oracle in the park at the end, I instantly thought: ""Yes, finally some answers.  This should be good."" Instead I got nothing.  A vague peace treaty and that was it. In the end, Revolutions feels like it cheats you.  You want more answers, you want closure.....but you don't get it.  You get and ending which explains a couple of things, and then leaves the rest in the air.  That's not how you end a trilogy.<br/><br/>Now before everyone comes out and starts screaming at me because ""I didn't get Revolutions"" let me say this.  I had a lot of theories about the movie and I came here and browsed the boards and sure enough, 95% of my theories were correct.  Neo's wireless connection to the source, Neo's death, the details of the machine/human treaty....I understood it all. You want more answers, you want closure.....but you don't get it.  You get and ending which explains a couple of things, and then leaves the rest in the air. That's not how you end a trilogy or a movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, if you liked the first 2 matrix movies, see this.  If you didn't like the second, this one is likely to disappoint.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As an individual movie----6/10<br/><br/>As an entry to the matrix series----9/10<br/><br/>As an ending to the matrix series----7/10"

","The Matrix Revolutions is the park ride equivalent to a roller coaster. It starts off slow (in a good way), taking you up the track. Reaching the top, it free falls into a world of war, excitement, and mayhem. <br/><br/>A lot of cats were disappointed with this film. I, for one, dug it to the fullest!   Being the final installment (I think) of the Matrix Trilogy, I did not expect this film to have an ending or ""revelation"" that would change my life. Most did, I believe. Instead, I went in hoping for an exciting and fulfilling end to a great threesome of films. I left the theater high (not that version of ""High"" you often see in after school specials - although one might enjoy it that way too) and satisfied.<br/><br/>Cutting to the chase: High points: The War Between the Machines and Man, The Showdown between Smith and Neo, and overall, just about the entire film Low Points: I don't really have any (the death of one of the characters could have been edited better) The special effects in this film are better than just about any film I've seen in the last four years. Overall, THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS is one of my favorite films of the year. If you go in expecting to look too far down the rabbit hole, you'll be disappointed.

","I went into this film with an open mind. I was disappointed with reloaded, but figured this film would redeem the series. Boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>I have a hard time finding anything good to say about this film. The special effects were mediocre, outside of the big battle scene, which went on way too long. The fight scenes were few and far between, and not very well filmed. Plot lines unrealistically resolved. In short, not a very good effort.<br/><br/>The thing that really makes the first film stand out, other than the outstanding premise, is the visual shots, and how they were framed and presented, this film has no real artistic vision. This could be any other generic Sci-Fi shoot-em-up action film, aka Battlefield Earth, Stormship Troopers, Etc. Etc. Etc.<br/><br/>Go see the film, you know you want to.

"thecrazyivan","8","0","0","5 November 2003"," Amazing special effects, but a bit unbalanced in other departments.
","You can tell that this movie has some amazing special effects, and ""Egg"" room that was built to film in (giant green screen dome) got a lot of good use. Unlike Reloaded, there aren't any scenes requiring massive computer generation (such as Neo's fight with the Smith clones), so things are kept pretty realistic. Bullet Time was downplayed and used rather sparingly, which was a surprise. I was actually looking forward to it. I did think that a bit too much time was actually spent on the war in Zion scene. I liked the progression, but it seemed as if half of the movie was dedicated to it. Concurrently (sounding like the Architect :-p), very little time was spent in talking, vis-Ã -vis the second movie. A bit of a change, but a good one, since this is what most people disliked in the second movie.<br/><br/>The ending was also rather anticlimactic, but for a movie with this story, there wasn't much else to be expected. There was no way it could have ended in a simple fist-fight.<br/><br/>It didn't strike me until later, but seeing in the Oracle in the very last scene also didn't make much sense."

I didnt know how the story was going to end, thats the brilliance of Reloaded. Some may disagree no doubt, but Reloaded has an Empire strikes back factor. It sets the scene for a grand finale, and from the outset looks promising, but as the story goes on, it becomes way too sentimental for its own good and doesnt deliver the meat and potatas. I think the Matrix is fantastic, its a good idea delivered well and i was verry excited about Revolutions but it just wasnt there. Long live Neo, at least he tries to fight for us. Liver"
"twisterx","Null","0","0","5 November 2003"," Better than Reloaded
","If I had to stick to a one sentence explanation to this movie, it would definitely mention that this film is much better than its predecessor, The Matrix Reloaded. Whereas for some reason, I left Reloaded feeling cheated, Revolutions made up for it, serving a sound finale to a great story.<br/><br/>The original movie will always be the original movie, there is no doubt. However, Revolutions tries hard to honor The Matrix where Reloaded...I'm sorry- what was the point of Reloaded?<br/><br/>This movie has quite a few throwbacks to the original and carries the themes of the first movie along. No more confusing Architect speeches, and very little of the Merovingian. The emphasis is on the human characters here, and the human emotions. Corny? Yes. Cheezy? Definitely. But where it could be the cold, detached atmosphere of the first film, it instead opts to bring in something odd and new to the sci-fi genre. Warm, fuzzy love. Go on gag, but it works. It works very well. The film still carries the malignancies of the genre (writing, acting), so don't go looking for Shakespeare because it's not there.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an enjoyable movie and a fitting end to a memorable Trilogy. And come on, did you really think they could've ended it any other way?"
"aszaat03s","8","0","0","5 November 2003"," A fitting tribute to a grand epic...Like the end of a good book.
","Pay NO attention to skeptical critics (professional or not), who draw their critique on something that means nothing to them.  In other words, critics (professional) have to see well over a 100 films per year.  If you've made The Matrix a part of you, like what can happen after reading a book, then all aside, this is the single most exciting film series after made.  This has far surpassed, Star Wars and The Lord of The Rings.  You could use the phrase, ""The Star Wars for generation next,"" so be it.<br/><br/>Now, all that aside, there are some people that will be let down after seeing the movie.  There is much more violence, much more action, and far less actual scripted (in terms of spoken words) plot.  It does, however, draw everything to conclusion with a fantastic ending sequence.  Acting, in general, is as strong as in Reloaded, but still falling short of the original.  Visually the movie exceeds Reloaded, although, everyone will say that the first movie is better.  A word about the first film: The Matrix was a self-contained movie.  It had it's own ending; it's own philosophical ideology.  Reloaded, and Revolutions give what the viewer wanted most at the end of the first film, MORE!  It was the international acceptance of a fresh film idea.  Thus, the second and third films where as much the W. Brothers vision as it was made probably for the fans.  We want to see what happens, and now we know.<br/><br/>Yes, CGI images don't look real, I'm not saying they do.  However, THESE CGI images come as close to real as you can get.  Isn't that why we use them? There should be no question that a computer image doesn't look as real as life!  Give moviemakers (and computers) some time. Let's say 20 years. Then they will probably look `real'.<br/><br/>Take a look at these movies, these heart pounding, and insightful, inspirational, movies.  Take a step back; look at your world, in all its glory.  Realize what it took to make these films.  Look at all the hard work put forth by the actors.  And all you writers, you critics, can give these actors, these film makers, is a lousy 2.5/5.<br/><br/>Finally, enjoy these movies because, most probably, it will be the end of a great story.<br/><br/>Everything that has a beginning has an end!  And what a great one it was!!"

","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>While it's without a doubt that ""Matrix Revolutions"" is far inferior to the original ""Matrix"", I'd say it's about on par with ""Reloaded"", although, most importantly, ""Revolutions"" is simply a completely different kind of movie.<br/><br/>What made the first, and to a lesser extent, the second Matrix movie so much fun were the spectacular action scenes in the ""real world"": people being able to do things they're normally incapable of in a seemingly ""normal"" world.<br/><br/>This third movie instead takes place largely outside of virtual reality (except for a brief part in the beginning and the end battle), and as a result the action is not nearly as interesting. The mass battle scenes involving the defense of Zion and a minute-long tunnel chase look spectacular, but ultimately they're not very plausible since the humans just get away with everything way too easily, overcoming seemingly overwhelming odds with ease, and way too many of the main characters (including that incredibly annoying kid) surviving. <br/><br/>When the fighting does get taken into the Matrix, the results are mixed. The initial fighting scene in the night club is OK, but nothing new. The final battle is certainly spectacular, but also goes so far over the top that it's hard to take it seriously. It's not terrible, but not the climax I'd hoped for either.<br/><br/>In terms of story, we get a much less convoluted plot (compared to the second part) and a lot less quasi-philosophical ramblings, although what is there is admittedly still quite vague and pretentious. I also couldn't find any really plausible explanations for some of the quite large questions (like: why can Neo use his powers when not plugged in, and why/how does Smith die at the end). I also think there are too many gooey love and death scenes in the movie, but this is a minor complaint. <br/><br/>In the end, it's hard what to make of the movie. It's much more like a generic sci-fi movie than the previous two Matrix films, and it doesn't contain enough action sequences of the kind that made the other movies great. Then again, in spite of some reasonably large plot holes, I didn't find the story as annoying as in ""Reloaded, and it certainly wasn't as slow. ""<br/><br/>Like I said, compared to the first Matrix this third installment falls short on all fronts, compared to the second one it has some pluses and some minuses, and on its own right its a watchable although not very plausible sci-fi movie that probably has more in common with Star Wars or Lord of the Rings (the mass battles) than with the other Matrix movies. <br/><br/>

When someone goes to see an action movie, they don't want to sit through lectures about love, choices and beliefs before they get to the action. They know what the film is capable of, and they know what they've paid to see.<br/><br/>The Matrix is a stubborn film. It refuses to accept that the audience is ahead of the story. The discovery that Agent Smith has entered the real world is drawn out, The exposition in front of the Zion council states what we already know, and Neo and Trinity spin the ""I love you"" plate one time too many, desperately trying to keep it balanced on it's wavering stick of credibility.<br/><br/>What is so frustrating is that while Revolutions wastes FAR too much time over-explaining what we already know, it fails to provide answers when they are really needed: (Why was Smith's possession of Neo his downfall? What happened to Neo at the end? How do the machines and humans re-integrate?), Instead of an explanation, all we get is a flash of light. Even the action is insubstantial - most noticeably, the fight with Agent Smith, which is a laughable anti-climax. But hey, never mind all that kids! Be blown away by the film's philosophy!

He's got good lines, he's got character, and he's not in the film nearly enough.

Yeah, it's full of the same mystery and weird plot twists, but enjoy the eye candy and ponder the plot later.   Afterward, you'll be left wondering whether this is really just a trilogy."
"matrixlamb","10","0","0","5 November 2003"," Revolutions requires a clear head and a free mind (with spoilers at the end)
","Professional critics don't like this movie too much. But those critics, with their big words and all those syllables, don't get it. It's possible the general public may not either. The problem is viewer expectation. The Matrix is the best movie ever made. Before Reloaded came out, there was a lot of time to theorize about the future of the trilogy. While few things are more enjoyable than four a.m. drunken ponder sessions about the sequels, it's not healthy. It's better to simply keep an open mind and take the story for what it's worth. A trilogy with biblical parallels, high-octane action, and cutting edge special effects. Revolutions keeps true to its roots all the way to the end.<br/><br/>THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS.....<br/><br/>When all is said and done, the only thing missing is the Resurrection. Reloaded, Revolutions, Resurrection? Imagine a pay-per-view anime webcast that ties up the loose ends. It could happen. And when the trilogy is seen as a whole, it warrants something. That is the only element that is really missing. In a story that tries to answer questions about reality and existence, it seems to skimp on the after-life aspect of being. Neo's dead but the Oracle expects to see him again sometime? The humans are being freed to live where? How?<br/><br/>This movie encompasses everything that entertainment should be. And while a next chapter may not seem likely because it would throw off the balance of the trilogy, consider the other media that already has. Enter the Matrix and The Animatrix are entwined in the story as much as the movies.<br/><br/> As you re-examine the whole story at the conclusion of Revolutions, forget about what you wanted to happen, and remember the trek that the story took you on. It was a good one. Hopefully we'll find out someday how it ends."

","I am a great fan of the matrix. I was first in line to get tickets. I loved the original Matrix, reloaded, Animatrix and enter the matrix, I have had the full experience that the Wachowski brothers have offered and now I see the final result of their work I can't help but feel sad that it's all ended.<br/><br/> I saw the reviews and from that most will think little of it. They may be expecting the meaning of life to be revealed but the philosophy is only there to help the story.<br/><br/>They want to see something original again, this movie will full under the curse of the sequel just like the star wars prequels; they want the original but it's not going to happen you should just wait a few years and see the original again to recap that feeling.<br/><br/> Within the 6 month period I have had to think about the situation and story development and without giving away the story I will say that it's hard to think of a perfectly happy ending. I was sitting next to a friend who was hardly as excited to see this as I was and at the conclusion he told me all he hated about the story, I had to explain why and such, I realised that many people over the world had probably simultaneously thought the same thing.<br/><br/> It doesn't mean you're stupid if you don't get it and everyone's entitled to hate it (even fans) but if you're like me and you've had the full experience, you will certainly appreciate the conclusion of a great saga."

","I just came back from seeing revolutions - I think it was mis-titled, as it wasn't a revolution - but it was a resolution.  There is nothing terribly new about Revolutions, but it does serve to bring a conclusion to the story.<br/><br/>The effects and styling were wonderful as always - this alone is worth seeing. The plot moves along pretty well (while it does get bogged down in some spots, it recovers nicely). The ending scene itself leaves a bit to be desired (some of the spoiler fake endings are somewhat better - but what can you do?)<br/><br/>So, overall - if you are a fan of the franchise, I would encourage you to see it and take it all in. If you haven't seen the first two - go rent the first two movies first and if you enjoyed them, you will enjoy this."

","Welcome, welcome, please step inside! It's the big Matrix night! Rumor has it, it's going to be a revolution this time. Even more! Come, come, don't fear anything, because there is nothing to fear. There is nobody here: look, the whole cinema is empty. It will only be you, me and the Matrix. Everything else, well those will be my tricks. <br/><br/>Minor Spoilers<br/><br/>I've come this far and I've seen the Matrix trilogy. I really doubt it was ever supposed to be one. It would've been better if it hadn't. But, as it is, we have to play along, pay our tickets and hope things won't be as they always are. Still we can choose and the choices we make can change the outcome of the action. That means we can choose not to go, we can choose not to indulge this kind of attitude towards us and towards art. You can do that, you still have the chance. I've wasted mine. <br/><br/>It's sad to see how things have turned out. What once was an impressive Sci-Fi movie, even more, has become a lame drama pumped up with action to fill in the gaps of loneliness: I mean those silences when Neo looks at Trinity and they proclaim their everlasting love. The Matrix wasn't about that and it's not what the people, the audience, wanted to see. I therefore expect a negative outcome of this affair. Fairly predictable, lacking any real innovations up to the end, which surprisingly does save a small fish. Too bad it isn't enough to save the species. And if you are wondering, yes there still is room for another. As the producers have run short of smart talk, they just thought using some ""reloaded"" lines would do just as well. Guess what: it didn't. Expect to get bored, but don't leave the cinema before it stops, because then you will say your final(?) journey into the Matrix was a real waste.<br/><br/>So in case you do fight through until the end, then you can expect some big ""booms!"" and ""bams!"", even some intelligent talk. Or is it just smart? Anyway, you will also so what has become of the once fearsome agent Smith. Actually he's become a farce, a lame excuse for an ending. And I don't know why, but I don't think it's good. What's even worse is that a mad thought went through my head: he's the best thing of this film.<br/><br/>I agree with those who will say it's entertaining towards the end, because it is.But there's a difference between entertaining and good. These two terms don't quite coincide. <br/><br/>Neo, what have you saved? Maybe the world, for the moment, maybe your Matrix, but not ours. It's not right, why should we suffer while you live? 6.5/10"

"man_dude","6","0","0","5 November 2003"," It'll make a lot of money for a mediocre movie.
","I was optimistic that this movie was going to be good. Instead the movie was only somewhat entertaining; lacking any real substance of any kind other than a fruitless love story. It was a standard Hollywood movie with generic ingredients to make it run for its two hours. I won't ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it yet with many details about what happens in the movie, but it doesn't really matter because anything I say won't ruin it further.<br/><br/>For the action folks who are gung-ho about ""action action action"", this movie has some slow parts which could have been skipped in order to get the ""action action action"" feel out of it. I'm torn between whether more substance would have been better, or if less effort putting  substance in an awkward manner and focusing more on action and shortening the movie would have been better. That may be a bad idea though, due to the fact that the action gets mind-numbingly dull towards the end.<br/><br/>A theme of love and that it is forever binding, and with love you can do anything is more an annoyance than well done to any extent - they should have just saved this for the Matrix Musical, because it really gets in the way. I don't hate Trinity, she is just annoying and how people act who are in love are like ""Merv"" said - Insane. I'm not dissing romance movies, because there are love stories I like; this is not one of them.<br/><br/>The action gets mind-numbingly dull towards the end of the movie, where you see a lot of the stuff you've probably seen before. The ""Superman"" battle is much akin to a ""Real-life"" Dragon Ball Z (which I've never been a big fan of). Its all very boring. A willing suspension of belief is an absolute necessity when watching, and maybe I was not in the mood/mode to believe whatever they threw on screen.<br/><br/>I was stoked to go see this movie, but was slapped in the face with something that could have been something else. There are definitely parts I liked, laughed at, and enjoyed, but for the most part it was too generic to be anything but mediocre. I'd give it a 6/10."

","I enjoyed this film. Yes, that's right, I may have been the only one, but it wasn't as shockingly bad as it has been made out to be.<br/><br/>In its own right, the matrix revolutions is a well written acted and directed film. It seems to me that people are slating this film for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>The first film was original and ground breaking, I accept that this one is not, but only because it's a sequel. Such a claim is almost impossible for any sequel to satisfy. Terminator 2 being an obvious exception.<br/><br/>People in love with the first film find it difficult to let go of the trilogy they had already written and directed in there own head before reloaded and revolutions had arrived. Too often do I hear people saying they didn't like it because it wasn't what they expected, or wanted. Problem is, people often don't know what they want. Nothing short of wiping there memory and replaying the first film would suffice.<br/><br/>This was a good film, not a great film, (not imdb top 250 standard) but worth every penny of my admission.  Perhaps it should have been left as one film, but as trilogy I consider this a strong, well written and entertaining ending to the 3 films.<br/><br/>A lot of unanswered questions from the last film are answered and the answers make sense, they fit in with the films path and theme and leave the viewer with a sense of completion as well as room for thought and interpretation.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with this film and I find that people who tell me how rubbish this film is have difficulty telling me why.

This movie is tied with Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers as the most mind-bendingly HUGE EPIC picture we've ever seen.<br/><br/>The film starts off basically where Reloaded ended. The first fifteen minutes are a bit slow. The ""Train Man"" is really creepy. We are introduced to a ""new"" oracle in a way that's almost funny in the way they have to make do with Gloria Foster's absence. The new actress playing the Oracle, however, has all the right mannerisms of her predecessor down.<br/><br/>Then, we are thrown into a battle that is grand, epic, and terrifying on a near-cosmic level. The very sight of the unrelenting tide of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of swarming Sentinels will send you into utter shock and disbelief. It's simply like nothing you have ever seen.<br/><br/>And then it gets better.<br/><br/>Neo, now blind, sees everything machine-related in orange code. Trinity flies the Nebuchadnezzar to the Machine City, where, after telekinetically destroying hundreds of sentinels in an impressive fireworks display, Neo brokers a deal with the Machines. He confronts the Interface, a machine that speaks in a terrifying thunderous voice that literally shakes the floor with bass, and Neo is hooked back into the Matrix. There, Neo and Smith duke it out in the best hand-to-hand combat sequence ever put to film. Their fight results in whole city blocks being leveled, rainfall being sent back up into the sky, and giant impact craters being created.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie there are many Christ references, as you may well know, such as walking on water, the phrase ""It is done"", etc.<br/><br/>Agent Smith is by far the best villain ever in cinema history. Hugo Weaving deserves an Oscar for his role, this guy can ACT. The Wachowski Brothers should be given a Congressional Medal of Honor for this movie.

It is almost like a director's cut with a lot of unnecessary scenes and sequences.  Audiences wanted to see a lot of Neo power (e.g. special effects) would be disappointed.  There should be more footage on Neo than the rest.  The anticipated final battle between Neo and Smith boils down nothing more to a dirty fist fight. There is also a lot missing on the intellect side and there the ending isn't as ""deep"" as most expected.

","The problem with trilogies is that each story is supposed to follow on from the previous one. However the problem with the Matrix is that the first movie was complete in its own right. The following two films add more dimension and issues to the idea of the matrix and to Zion without being their own stories.<br/><br/>The reason people are not happy when they exit from Revolutions is a couple of things: 1) It IS actually a tedious film 2) It is anti-climactic: the trilogy is over and you now know the whole story. 3) When given the answers to the problems in the first and second films people think, ""Is that it? That's the answer I have been waiting for? I thought of that myself, what a crock!"" And this is usually followed by no. 2<br/><br/>So, the 3rd movie may be crap, but hey, at the least the Wachowskis gave us the matrix, created this hype and the first one is still something to be fascinated by (and Animatrix aint that bad either)."

","*May contain spoilers* We all know from watching the previous two films, that the ""real world"" is not a pretty place.  There's no sun under the thick cloud cover and tarantula-like machines rule most of the world.  Knowing that part three's final battle with the machines would occur in the real world, this dark, depressing atmosphere was to be expected.<br/><br/>What was not expected, however, was that the Wachowski brothers would abandon so many of the elements that made the first two films so popular. There are far less ""bullet time"" scenes, and where they do exist; they fall short of the level of creativity and awe of the first two films.  One may argue that fans that feel this way were jaded from the amazing ideas of the first two films, but I feel this is an objective perspective.  The scenes just aren't as exciting or innovative this time.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is what we expect.  There are next to no real plot twists, other than seeing some of our favorite characters die.  The machines invade, there is a fireworks-gun power battle in Zion and Neo does what he feels he must do to save the world.<br/><br/>In the end, we're left with the confirmation that the war has ended, but for how long?  There is also an uncertainty with what truly becomes of Neo.  I thought a final film in a trilogy is meant to put together all the loose pieces, but this one may create as many as it solves.  It feels kind of like the end of Terminator 3, that there is more ahead? or at least should be.<br/><br/>All in all, the action was intense throughout and the acting solid as usual. It's just not like the first two films, not as fun.  The first two films are the kind of movies most people will watch time again because they are awe-inspiring and take the viewer to many different places.  This film takes us on a one-way path into the darkest depths of hell, which I'm uncertain the vast majority of people will be excited about revisiting.<br/><br/>IMDB Score: 6/10"

","After catching Matrix Revolutions last night, I was actually compelled to sit through the credits right to the end. This was not only because the final song was brilliant, but because of the amazing achievement this final piece of the Matrix puzzle proved to be.<br/><br/>The Wachowski brothers went ahead and did the last thing anyone expected with the third movie -- they just continued the story. This seems to be upsetting all the obsessive theorists out there, but was a sigh of relief for me. Everything you'd seen or heard in previous installments was simply taken at face value and continued. I've always believed that the sign of true brilliance is simplicity.<br/><br/>So what is the movie, if not a convoluted maze of plot twists and story contrivances? Well it's an action movie, first and foremost, with some of the most dazzling sequences and sfx you'll ever see. The philosophical references and musings are still there, but seemed much more accessible this time around. It doesn't take itself too seriously and benefits from this greatly. However, when there is a big edge-of-your-seat moment, Revolutions does not undermine it with humour as Reloaded tended to.<br/><br/>In the male-dominated audience with which I shared the cinema, I heard many an apathetic sigh during the romantic scenes. But, although these set off my corny-meter like crazy, I actually enjoyed them due to the obviously more tragic tone this story took.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving's performance alone makes this movie worth watching -- he has combined Smith's overblown maniacal evil with a touch of vulnerable self-doubt to hilarious effects. I could listen to him saying lines like ""Ooooh, I'm not so bad, once you get to know me"" all day and not get bored. Every time he was onscreen, I couldn't help grinning stupidly. In fact all of the cast seemed to show a little more humanity and vulnerability in this one, which was quite refreshing.<br/><br/>With regard to the action, the Wachowskis didn't spend much time treading old territory. The action seemed fresh and more true to the sensibilities of the original. The war scenes were overwhelmingly intense and the few set-piece fight scenes were innovative and very cool. They were also used sparingly enough as to not overwhelm you into numbness and eventual apathy.<br/><br/>Much of the action occurred between real people in the real world. Without the unconstrained safety of the Matrix, the characters were actually vulnerable to injury. And because it's a trilogy-ender, you knew some characters might not make it.<br/><br/>And the finale between Smith and Neo -- well, let me just say that this scene delivered all of the energy and excitement I had hoped for.<br/><br/>Overall, I cannot imagine a better end to the trilogy. I'm confident that, once the dust settles and people let go of their own anticipatory versions of the movie and watch the one we were given, this trilogy will be seen as one of the classic action sci-fi pieces of all time."

They do some fantastic special effects there that I've seen only in Anime` and yet managed to make it look incredible for the real thing. Congrats to the boys on that, otherwise, I give it 7 overall."

I wish the Wachowski brothers could have a do-over on this one.<br/><br/>There were parts of the movie that made it worth the price of admission. Great bits of heroism on behalf of the humans in Zion.  Some very suspenseful moments.<br/><br/>Oh, and a cheesy death scene that lasted for ever.

","...and nowhere near, but what is?! I found Matrix Revolutions enjoyable enough, although I found it left a lot of unclosed issues, and it didn't have the freshosity of the 1st and 2nd. <br/><br/>Of course not everyone will like it, but it's worth watching to make up your own mind. <br/><br/>I found it a little slow, and I found Mary Alice as the Oracle a little annoying, but she had a tough role to play, succeeding the glorious Gloria Foster.<br/><br/>Matrix Revolutions was not a disappointment, although I had prepared myself for anything, but it did not have the same enthusiasm as the first or second. I found the action a little overdone (I'm not saying it wasn't speccy though), and some parts a little too Star Wars like.<br/><br/>The end was a little predictable - it was the only way it could be solved if the brothers were to keep on following the religious lines they have been through the movies, but I was left a little confused as to the EXACT significance of the little girl, Sati (or Saki..?)<br/><br/>Anyway, it wasn't too bad as a piece of entertaining film, and I do urge you to make up your own mind about it, and try to go into it with an open mind. DO NOT JUDGE IT BY WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID - each to their own (as they say), and everyone will have a different opinion, so make up your own!"

","I don't know why lots of people mock this movie. Well, maybe it's not the best movie there is. IMO, Reloaded and Revolutions aren't as good as The Matrix, but doesn't mean that they're bad. Reloaded was seen as just an ""action"" movie generally, although there was a big story in it(with The Architect, and all the other explanations leading to Neo's meeting with The Architect), and to me that was a big plot that adds a big, big, depth to the movie. Revolutions is a good movie in a sense that it concludes (or not really, you'll know what I mean if you've watched the movie) the story perfectly. And for some people that are looking Revolutions as even worse than Reloaded is probably because they didn't like Reloaded already, and both movies were made in one production. The way I look at this movie, it gives a perfect conclusion. And not being biased here, the movie is right by having a tagline of ""Everything that has a beginning has an end."" I don't get some people that are saying it should've stopped in the first one, no more movies should've been made. The whole story is in the whole trilogy! I recommend that you see The whole Matrix Trilogy with the Animatrix series, then you'll get the complete wonderful, very creative, I don't know what else to say, it's such an awesome story as a whole!"

It's better than Reloaded because it's the concluding story, it brings (most of) the tail ends of the story, it has a kick ass adrenaline ride in the middle that would have stood up as a perfect ending (had this been some other film not trying to push the boundaries of what people are thinking).<br/><br/>There are 2 problems... not with the film... with the people who don't like it... 1. They have made the film theirs, and have forgotten that it is the Wachowski's epic - it is the Wachowski's story and they decide the path (not the viewers) 2. They need a constant stream of verbal diarrhoea to maintain the logic centers in their brain and keep them thinking - ""Gee there is a lot of backstory and theology in here!""<br/><br/>The film pulls away from gumballing the viewer with Architect babble - it's there to move the plot along, but is mostly put into symbolism.  And whilst brilliant Hell is unleashing all over the screen (and the sad bits kind of do lack acting ability), I (as a Star Wars fan) would choose this over Attack Of The Clones.<br/><br/>If you want to enjoy this film: 1. Drop your preconceptions - this is not your film, you are along for the ride. 2. Read the pictures (they are the words) - they will tell you what the symbolism is 3.

","This took its time getting started. The first hour offers a few ""been there/seen that"" kung fu/machine gun/exploding concrete wire fights, and, like the last one, lots of conversations that don't really go anywhere.<br/><br/>
I think the biggest problem I had is that all the characters are out of their elements, and as a result the action scenes are very different than what we're used to. In fact, most of the really good action scenes go to secondary characters. Morpheus and Trinity are given little to do, and even Neo takes a backseat until the last half hour or so.<br/><br/>Halfway through we get the battle for Zion. This is where the movie really hits its stride. This is one amazing sequence that goes on for  half an hour. Worth the price of the ticket alone.<br/><br/>Then we get the wrap-up, with Neo fulfilling his destiny. This is where i felt the movie really fell apart. The entire showdown with Smith and the reasoning behind it seemed forced, and their fight was way too overblown. It was like something out of Superman 2. You would think that would be a good thing, but its not. Their fight in the first one was much better.<br/><br/>The entire conclusion is murky and unsatisfying. It makes the whole series seem like much ado about nothing. Some like it that way. To me, it feels like the W brothers didn't know how to finish what they started."

","I have the same impression as of the first of the Matrix trilogy. This could be quite a good film if the authors' thought was not so lazy.<br/><br/>
The movie is full of the scenes and characters that lead to nowhere, do not develop and are not necessary. Why did they introduce  Trainman? What does he do for the movie? I waited for a new  meeting with Frenchman and his beautiful wife. But not such a meeting, boring and without a purpose, really. <br/><br/>The design of the machines is as stupid as in the first film. No defence from above? I am sorry, it is difficult to buy. <br/><br/>And the peace in the end is ridiculous. Even for a minute one cannot believe that this would be more lasting than any of the Middle East settlements. They don't last despite all our good intent, do they? <br/><br/>
Yet, it was so easy to make a good ending. Instead of the deal with the machines, Neo had to beat agent Smith, take over all his replicas and while the machines attack in the real world, millions of Neos would smash their software. A great battle, crazy machines destroy their own material base and Neo dies trapped in the decomposing Matrix."

","I saw this movie last night, and hated it.  Absolutely hated it, and I wasn't alone.  As soon as the credits began to roll the man beside me jumped up grumbling in disgust.  I must have heard the word ""terrible"" coming from every direction.  I had hoped I was alone in my rancor but sadly no. And then I slept on it.  As I think back on the movie, most things that come to mind are things I liked.  There could have been a great movie there, many plot points would have been great had the movie been executed well.  The fatal flaw, however, lies deep in the writing, the directing(for dialogue, not action), and all the basics of filmmaking.  It wasn't just that the movie focused way to much on action, which it did, it was that the few bits of plot and dialogue that were squeezed in were horribly underdeveloped. Don't get me wrong, many of the action sequences and battles in this movie were the finest to date in the trilogy, and the CG effects in the Zion confrontation some of the best I've ever seen.  But in the face of a lack of any real emotional or intellectual substance, the extended battles eventually became tiresome.  If they could have only waited another year, gone back and made sure that the Human story was told well, this could have been a truly incredible film, instead of a forgettable and unworthy addition to a trilogy based on a film that deserved to stand alone. <br/><br/>

","I just saw The Matrix: Revolutions, which is a huge improvement over the lackluster Reloaded, which opened earlier this year. However, with that being said, it's not the trilogy ender that many had hoped for! The first Matrix is by far the best science fiction film of the 1990's and even though Reloaded wasn't nearly as inventive, I did want to see what loose ends were in store for our heroes in this third and final film in the Matrix trilogy!<br/><br/>MILD SPOILERS AHEAD:<br/><br/>Highlights: The battle of Zion between the APU's and the Sentinentals is easily the best part of the film, and I actually felt sorry for Mifuni after he stood up to all of those Sentinentals, in fact I felt more emotional for the passing of his character than in the passing of a certain major female character towards the end of the film. Also, the Neo vs. Smith end battle has tremendous special effects, but we've seen it before and after the exhausting Zion battle nothing could top that! Also, interesting is the battle in Merovingian's S&M club at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>
However, with all of that great action, I have to say that there are some questions to be answered, as the end of the film wasn't the ending that many had hoped for and left a lot of unanswered questions. Plus the way that the Neo and Trinity characters are finalized may frustrate those who are passionate about these characters. Morpheus has little to do in this film as opposed to the action he had in Reloaded. The standout characters in my opinion were Niobe, a great pilot, Captain Mifune for standing his ground against that massive flood of sentinentals and, Seraph, who shows he can kick as much butt as Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus.<br/><br/>If you're looking for great action, Revolutions has the most action of the three movies, but if you're looking for a philosophical resolution to the trilogy, you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>A 9 on a scale of 1-10 for all of the great action.<br/><br/>A 3 on a scale of 1-10 for the storyline and script that we've come to love from this science fiction trilogy!<br/><br/>So I would round out both numbers and give it a 6 on a scale of 1-10!<br/><br/>With that being said, it is still THE science fiction trilogy/ franchise of the 21st century to beat!"

","When I heard Fox had bought the rights to a live-action adaptation of the anime series DRAGONBALL, I was worried... until I saw Neo's last fight with Smith. I didn't catch the Smith-Anderson etymological metaphor of artifice vs man until then. All that was missing were fireballs--I hope I'm not spoiling anything by saying that. <br/><br/>Big problem: who cares who dies in Zion? The only characters who've gained my sympathy in RELOADED were the kid and Link--his gf was on the verge of annoying. Locke, councillor Hamann, Bane, Bane's captain, all the other captains except Morpheus and maybe Niobe, Mifune, the funny-looking lady heading the council, they could all have been sent unarmed on the front line, and the movie would still have maintained its emotional integrity. So when I saw Sentinels ""sit down,"" they gained over all the sympathy I'd saved up for the Zionites. Not that they are all mediocre people, but they get as much pity as strangers we would read about in the obituaries. Even the artificial Indian family we see at the beginning has more sympathy from me than the faceless or characterless populace of unplugged humans. The Merovingian! great character! His wife Persephone! Nearly even better! Had they been fighting the Sentinels, I would have bawled my eyes out. Had the Ghost twins or the tall Werewolf or the Asian goon with the beige coat working for the French man from Reloaded been on the losing side of the battle, I would have had more emotional investment in the war. From playing the game, I would have wished Ghost's character would get more of a story. The only people I got to care about were Neo and Trin and they seemed to only be making a guest appearance in the film (I'm exaggerating).<br/><br/>Sadly, the unfortunate substitution of the role of The Oracle took away all the love I had for one of my favorite characters from the first two movies.<br/><br/>
A smaller problem: Maybe it was because they were tyring to make a point of separating physics of the real world with those of the Matrix, but the lack of physical damage noticeable on the characters of Smith and Neo felt like watching a video game lacking much needed damage skins. The fights seemed inconsequential, and therefore of lesser importance.  Even in RELOADED Neo was bleeding when he stopped the sword... *SPOILER* Not to mention albeit thrilling, the Neo recapture was conducted with an ease that made me question the threat of his captors. Morpheus seemed to be a bigger fish to catch in THE MATRIX.*END SPOILER*<br/><br/>yet I really liked the end. Duality is a shallow concept, but I liked the movie nonetheless. I'm afraid I don't have many friends with whom I'll be able to share my appreciation of these three movies."

","Its funny for the contradictions in all 3 movies. Too much explaining (I think one reviewer said it best ""like a silent movie with the quecards to inform the viewers what was happening"") and yet so many questions left unresolved at the end... Well actually, I prefer having a heap of questions at the end where I have to think about the movie rather than being spoon fed the plot and meanings. So in essence i enjoyed this one far more than the second installment. However it did seem like a cross between ""Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within"" (A scene in Matrix Revolutions was a complete copy of a scene in FF.. I guess the fact that Squaresoft was involved in the ""Animatrix"" would explain that...) ""Independence Day"" and finally ""Fist of the North Star"" (Manga version not live action..). It just goes on to prove that the Matrix Trilogy really is an homage to Asian films. From manga such as ""Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Wicked City"" to John Woo and Tsui Hark flicks.<br/><br/>Anyhow, it all made a lot more sense to someone who comes from a background of asian movies for the essence of the plot.<br/><br/>A satisfying ending to the trilogy that mainly relies on visuals and hidden meannings."

The Kid known only as ""the kid"" in the film was just annoying and was too cliche!<br/><br/>But saying that i thought Weavings performance as Agnt Smith was awesome AGAIN!  Every time he was on the screen he lit up the film, sadly it flashed back to Keanu shortly after!<br/><br/>And what happened to Lambert Wilson (Merovingian) and Monica Belluci (Persophone) - they were both so good in the 2nd film, they were in it for all of 5 minutes in this one.

","I was surprised at the amount of negative reviews for ""Revolutions"".  I thought it was much better than ""Reloaded"".  Why?  First, the pacing was much better.  ""Reloaded"" got really talky several times in the film. ""Revolutions"" keeps it to a minimum, and the action scenes keep coming at a steady pace.  ""Reloaded"" had two large set pieces with more of the haki saki kung-fu.  While well done,  they were kind of a yawn.  Too many other films have burned us out on that stuff.  ""Revolutions"" only includes it sparingly, and accentuates the ""Star Wars"" super big CGI scenes.  I heard complaints that many of the questions weren't answered.  Nonsense! There are many scenes of full explanation and resolution in ""Revolutions"".  Oracle spills her beans, Neo fulfills his prophecy, Zion's fate is determined, every character pretty much wraps up their story.  Lack of character development is mentioned.  Well, perhaps the commander of the ATU's needed some background on why he screams incessantly while killing off the machine invaders, but it didn't bother me.  All other characters were fleshed out in ""Reloaded"".  Some reviews say that they didn't care what happens to the characters.  I was tense at times, when some of the characters were in peril.  Everybody does something for reasons that are clear.  The climax is fulfilling, and in general lives up to it's promises.  One thing no one argues about, is the fantastic special effects.  They are creepy, huge, and exciting.  I am waiting for it to come out on Imax before I see it again. But see again I most certainly will.  <br/><br/>I give a 7 out of 10."

","I don't think most people are appreciating this series of films for what they really are: True epics. The Wachowski Bros are using the modern ""action"" genre as a vehicle to explore the timeless questions that religions and philosophies seek to answer. Is there a God (or gods)? Is there such a thing as free will (or is it all predetermined)? What is karma? Can love conquer all?<br/><br/>Of course, there's a danger of taking all this seriously heady stuff too seriously. That's why the Wachowski's wisely gave us millions of deadly squid-bots getting blasted by an army of mech-warriors while the fate of the universe gets determined by a smashing atomic kung fu fight. Otherwise, you get something more like The Seventh Seal.<br/><br/>Filmicly (love that word!), Revolutions references so many movies and genres it's hard to keep track of. The obvious ones are: Aliens, Star Wars Trilology (the originals, folks), Work War II sagas of the '50s, Blade Runner, City of Lost Children, Terminator, kung fu movies, Hong Kong gangster flicks, Roman sagas of the '50s, etc, etc...<br/><br/>Not only that, but we get treated to a pantheon of Classic characters. Charon, the boat man of the river Styx (the passing to the realm of the dead), makes a great appearance as The Train Man (played convincingly by the whirly-bird pilot from the Road Warrior). The Architect is the Father (Reason) and the Oracle is any version of the Dark Mother (Chaos). Did you know that one of the older meanings of matrix is ""mother""?<br/><br/>So these Matrix films are, in my opinion, Great Art. They can be read and interpreted and appreciated on many levels. Interestingly, many of the comments here and by professional critics (there's a special level of Hell for film critics) seem to entirely miss the cool stuff. They focus on the unconvincing and preposterous love stories and absurd football rah-rah war hero bullsh*t. And yes, I believe these elements are weak, but they really are beside the point. They are just tired old stories.<br/><br/>Notice instead that Neo has transcended the world of conflict (duality) and has entered the realm of pure light (non-duality). From this higher realm, it does not matter if you are a machine or a human. All that matters is that you are conscious and aware. Everything else is just a silly game. That's why Agent Smith ""wins"" and ""loses"" at the same time. In the assimilation of Neo and all he represents, he accidentally gets himself enlightened! <br/><br/>All games have an end. You may choose either mutual annihilation, or you can simply say, ""Stop this nonsense, let's play something more fun!"" So what's it gonna be?"

","The greatest gift an artist can have is the knowledge of when to quit. In case you're wondering, the 'when' part has been over about two movies ago. They say leave well enough alone. I plead, ""Leave a classic alone.""<br/><br/>	I guess it is too late now. I understand some people are under the delusion that the matrix was originally thought up as a trilogy. Wake up. The Matrix was a masterpiece of imagination. It was a truly wonderful experience for the new generation of flicks. The last two 'installments' are just pathetic attempts at cashing in on the success of the classic.<br/><br/>	At the end of The Matrix, Neo was supreme. Numero Uno. The people were happy. Neo was happy. Morpheus was happy. Trinity was happy. The audience was happy. But there came the flaw. It meant the end of the cash flow. No chance of a sequel where the hero is undefeatable, right? So comes the twisted attempts at reviving the old connection to our pockets. Neo's importance is lowered. The one? Pchaw... Lots of 'the one' s have come and gone before. Morpheus is reduced from 'the leader of the flock, the father figure' to a nobody with low credibility with the authorities. A dreamer spreading false hopes to the world that is Zion. Agent Smith is revived. More powerful, deadlier than ever. And the money machine spins again. Hurray Hollywood.<br/><br/>	You shall note that I refrained from commenting on 'reloaded'. It left roughly half a million unexplained loose threads. I thought I'd better wait till I see the whole picture. I cannot regard 'reloaded' and 'revolutions' as two movies. Just one long pathetic movie. And now that I've just finished seeing 'revolutions', you know how many loose ends they've tied? Zero. Okay, so I exaggerated. So maybe they did try to answer some of them, but not satisfactorily. And they've brought in a lot of new strings as well.<br/><br/>	For the love of humanity do not try to mix the last two flicks with the original. What is the freaking point of the story anyway? We are not shown anything of the matrix anymore. The matrix and all the billions of people in it... It's over. Kaput. No mention at all. Are we to assume that Smith copied himself into ALL the matrix elements? They have tried to pass off the oracle as a program now, apparently trying to explain how she knows all. In the original, you had to be content with 'blind faith for matters beyond our understanding'. A belief in a person who can predict the future. No more. Since 'reloaded', the oracle is a program, plain and simple. Yeah, right... They're creating more questions than answers. The oracle is now a program which predicts some of the future, a program sent into exile as a choice over deletion. If she's a program, the programmer, the machine world, can create similar programs to 'predict' the future, and hence foresee the threat that is Neo. But none of that. Ultimately, did the oracle know all that happened would happen? The oracle says, ""I didn't know. I believed."" As in 'blind faith for matters beyond her/its understanding'?<br/><br/>
	And Mr.Smith, everybody's favorite agent, is now a self sufficient, malignant, all powerful free anti-Neo whose purpose is ... to end all. I loved the character of Mr. Smith, the agent from the original. The Mr.Smith program has actually grown in power to such an extend that he is beyond the control of the machine world and the real world. Mr.Smith also has the power to copy himself into the real world, in one of those bizzare loose strings I was telling you about. But Neo too, has the power to control (to an extend) forces of the real world. 	 	In the ultimate clash of the titans, where Neo and Smith face each other, it was so superficial that it was almost comical. Both character had been puffed by the writers up to such an unbelievable level that they just didn't know what to do. Oh, they tried their best to add colour to it. It just didn't make sense anymore. I'm not revealing the climax for the benefit of the lucky people who stayed away. But once you see it, think a bit about it. The next half million loose ended strings shall show themselves. Observe the vain attempts to try to make sense. <br/><br/>	I wouldn't wonder if they release a fourth sequel. It's very easy, when you decide the stories don't have to make sense anymore. It's not impossible. They might even try to make it like 'revolutions' was all just a dream, and try to explain that was how Neo controlled the 'real world' elements. I am being sarcastic, Hollywood... Let the cash machine stop here. Pretty Please. 	 	Neobe is the only new character since the original that showed some strong points. Weak, uninteresting, moot, and puffed up characters portrayed by some really lame over-actors filled up the rest of the 'new character' spots.<br/><br/>	On the upside, the graphics are reasonably adequate, and the soundtrack is way more appealing than the 'reloaded' version. It is reasonably fast paced. Visual effects are okay. The one real matrix stunt with gunmen walking around the ceiling was great. In all, I'd give it a 4.5/10."

","I wouldn't say this movie is brilliant like the original Matrix, but it is one really cool action thrill ride.  The story is fast paced, with almost non-stop action.  Some of the dialogue is a tad cheesy, but the amazing battle sequences more than make up for it.  That really was a visual feast.  <br/><br/>It doesn't quite have the depth of the original; a lot of the questions asked in the first two movies were left unanswered; and a lot of things introduced in Reloaded wasn't built upon.  But when a movie looked as good as Revolutions does, I never really notice any of its flaws while I watched it.  <br/><br/>The only complaint I had was that the final confrontation was a bit anticlimatic.  I won't say anything about it, but it pales in comparison in terms of visuals to any of the other previous fight sequences done in the entire Matrix series.  <br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie lived up to my expectations of a Matrix sequel. Frankly, if they made this movie like 45 minutes longer to explain the premise and cut the entire Matrix Reloaded, I wouldn't have minded."

","I liked The Matrix. Didn't think I'd eventually love it. I do now. After seeing Revolutions, that is. The first one made me say, ""cool"". The second one had me saying ""cool"" and ""huh?"". Mostly ""huh"". But this last one... just ""whoa"". This is not just about looking cool and intelligent and hardcore and making teenagers who don't really know anything about movies look smart and informed by saying they love ""The Matrix"". This is an epic struggle. Not for the survival of humanity. It would have survived either way. But for free will. Choice. I never really cared for the characters up until now. Okay, I'll admit, the first one was pretty tense, but besides that... no connection. But they sure plug you in on this one, baby. During the first two movies, I loved Smith. He was the coolest of the bunch. But now, I wanted him to die. Sure, he was still cool, but... you really hated him. The battle at Zion's dock walls for me stands as one of the most beautiful, exciting, involving sci-fi battles I've ever seen. I swear, this comes close to the Death Star run. Neo and Smith's climactic fight is truly a thing of beauty. It's Superman II and Dragonball and The Matrix (obviously) in one. Love it. And no, I didn't leave the ""I"" out of that sentence. That was an order."

","The Matrix Revolutions is a beautifully filmed movie with mind-boggling action sequences and incredible special effects.

The Matrix was built on the genre of the graphic novel and japanime- the<br/><br/>Brothers broke that pattern by giving us a feel-good ending.

","'Revolutions' premiered yesterday and so today I went see it, anticipating great stuff as you should after seeing the first two movies. While maintaining the tagline from earlier on, I think 'Revolutions' goes out of hand. Now everything we focus on is this man vs. machine battle, which to me is no different from the plot of Terminator. In 'Revolutions' they don't spend much time inside the Matrix at all. The action scenes are impressive but I must say, NOTHING compared to 'Reloaded.' (Possible Minor Spoiler)As for the conclusion, I expected to have all questions answered in a mind-twisting way, but as it turns out Neo is special and has special powers even outside the Matrix... this just doesn't make sense if ""the real world"" outside the Matrix really IS THE REAL ONE. Neo becomes a superhero much alike Daredevil (and this is very annoying). If you're into the matrix series you will still appreciate it, but as I gave 'Reloaded' a 10/10 I cannot do the same for this mishap.<br/><br/>6/10"
"rippa","10","0","0","5 November 2003"," Epic in it's own right
","many critics and average joes need to once and for all realize that no matrix sequel, or even possible prequel, will ever be comparable to the first.  As the saying goes ""you only have one time to make a first impression"" and from one of the opening lines ""No lieutenant, your men are already dead"" to Neo stopping the bullets and defeating Smith, nothing will compare with the surprise, intrigue, and flat out joy anyone got from being plunged into a world where nothing is what it seems.  With that said, Revolutions is an epic within its own right.<br/><br/>Note that i may reveal a few slight spoilers but not anything huge. Compared to the 1st and 2nd the fight scenes are probably better done, that isnt to say that they'll look noticeably better but the Superbrawl, as it has been dubbed, between Neo & Smith is a beast to behold.  The fight itself seemed rather short to me, maybe because I wanted more, but its choreography, lighting, and special effects were done masterfully.  Many people will likely enjoy the ""Fist Time"" effect near the end of the scene, which is breath-taking to say the least.  Running thru the action sequences last to first: the battle for Zion is very well done and has as much emotion in it from the warriors as any battle scene really could put forth; the 3rd major fight in the film (while there were smaller scuffles here and there I'd like to say 3 stand out) would be the 'Coat Check' fight scene in the depths of the Merovingian's Club Hell.  While the scene may not be a new bullet time to many, if you stop to think about how truly hard it is to have ppl running on the ceiling and on the floor in the same shot, it's hard to not appreciate the difficulty this scene involved and the precision they used to pull it off without a hitch.  All in all I feel that the 3 main fight/battle/action scenes in this movie, especially the superbrawl & battle for zion, can stand toe to toe with anything else and hold their own, including the first movie)<br/><br/>Philosophically many have been complaining and even ripping Revolutions as not having the same deep meanings as the 1st, and even the 2nd one.  My counterpoint to that is this: as the 3rd, and last movie, of this glorious trilogy, all the philosophic ideas brought forth in the first 2 movies will ultimately end here, and that is exactly what happens.  One of the last lines in the movie is ""Because I Chose Too"", in respect to the manor in which the line is given this can sum up the entire philosophy of the series: choice.<br/><br/>Plot wise I can't completely say that I was happy with the ending but, as in real life, sometimes we won't like the way things turn out even though thats the only way they could ever have turned out.  There are some very humorous parts to the movie, in retrospect, which are placed very well throughout. Realistically, I only had 1 single problem with this movie: the cross on Neo's chest.  People who have seen the movie will know exactly what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Suffice to say: was the third installment as good as the first?  No, the first will always be the best of the series because it was first.  But was this movie epic nonetheless?  to me, it's a great movie, regardless of time period or it's hype.<br/><br/>I give it 4 out of 4 stars"
"Harry-57","6","0","0","6 November 2003"," A Major Disappointment
","I think the Brothers Wachowski knew they had a dog on their hands with this one and figured that all would be forgiven if they simply threw $40 million at the Zion vs. Machines battle scene.  Well, they were wrong.  Yes, that scene was spectacular, but by the time it rolled around, I didn't really care what happened to anyone or anything in this movie.<br/><br/>How did things go so terribly wrong?  I think the failure of ""Revolutions"" can be blamed on lack of follow-through.  The first two films promised many things.  For example, when Neo told the Architect near the end of Reloaded that ""you better hope we don't meet again,"" and the Architect responds, ""don't worry, we won't,"" I took that to mean that Neo and the Architect would have some type of showdown in the third film.  Unfortunately, it turns out that the Architect was right.  And at the end of the first film, when Neo told the machines that he was going to show a few things to the people trapped in the Matrix, I assumed that maybe we would get to see some scenes in future movies of Neo doing just that (i.e., flying up to people and freaking them out with all the super-human things he could do, or perhaps even making an appearance at a Superbowl half-time show).  Well, nothing like that happened in the final film.  Indeed, some very outrageous things involving Agent Smith had to be going on within the Matrix at the same time Zion was under seige, but we didn't get to see any of it.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most disappointing part of ""Revolutions"" is the failure of the Wachowskis to do anything interesting with the fact that Neo, at the end of ""Reloaded,"" had ""The One""-type powers outside of the Matrix -- he could actually stop the Sentinals with his mind.  This suggested that perhaps Neo and the rest of the folks at Zion were still trapped within some type of Matrix, and I thought the third movie would begin by exploring this intriguing idea.  Well, I won't go into too much detail, but the explanation as to why he was able to do such things outside of the Matrix was unsatisfying, to say the least.<br/><br/>This film simply did not work.  I don't think the Wachowskis really had any clue regarding how to finish this story, and their lack of any good ideas in that regard pretty much doomed this final movie."

","On the day that the final segment of this hugely ambitious trilogy opened simultaneously in 65 countries, I was there, eager with anticipation for a clever and satisfying denouement, but it was as I feared - visually stunning but plot-wise a real disappointment. <br/><br/>It's still cool: the sunglasses, the long coats, the balletic fighting, the heavy armoury - but we've seen this twice before. The ferocious sentinel attack on Zion is the best part of the movie, reminiscent of the last-ditch massacre that concluded the 1969 western ""The Wild Bunch"", while deploying technology that seems to be borrowed (but further enhanced) from ""Aliens"". The titantic battle between Neo and agent Smith that ends the story is fun, but not a long way from Superman's encounter with General Zod in ""Superman II"". <br/><br/>Yet the Wachowski brothers have let us down on so many levels. Although we are spared most of that philosophizing from ""Reloaded"", the dialogue is pathetic and The Oracle in particular spouts meaningless nonsense. The twin love stories and the heroics of the 16 year old kid are toe-curlingly trite. Lambert Wilson (Merovingian) and Monica Belluci (Persephone) are appallingly underused. There are so many loose ends (or false trails) - what was the point of capturing The Keymaker and visiting The Architect in the second segment? <br/><br/>Above all, what does it all mean? As one character states towards the end: ""It doesn't make sense"". And, so far as one can put a construction upon it, it seems to be a relatively simple, if rather loose, retelling of the basic Bible story about the conflict between good and evil. We wanted more. We deserved more."

","What you need to say more than that? The Matrix Revolutions wasn't the greatest movie in the world and wasn't the absolutely worst movie in the world. Mind you that the first Matrix movie was something a different kind that changed movie making forever, but this one had all the good special effects and nothing of a plot, besides the fact that it was the last movie of the trilogy. Yes the Neo and Agent Smith fight scene was by far the best fighting sequence inside the entire film and the fight for Zion was good too, but you need more than special effects for a movie to be good. Characterization is something that lacked big time inside this movie, along with emotions. I know if something was invading my homeland I would be depressed, sad, disturbed, and among all other human emotions, scared that I would die. The people in Zion didn't show any of these emotions. The ones that believed in Neo didn't, and they had the right to, but the people that didn't, they didn't even care that they were loosing the battle at all. It would make one think that the 'machines' made this movie in a sense of mind. But all in all, the movies special effects were the only thing, and I mean the only thing that carried it on. For the people that posted the several questions inside their review, they are all answered, apparently you just didn't listen hard enough or pay attention good enough to get all the information that you needed to know. Though the Matrix was great, and Reloaded was good to, this one was a far distant third in my book. I would give it a 6.5 out of a 10 star scale."

","When I first saw The Matrix I was blown away. Everything in the first movie was so fresh, so innovative, so entertaining. When I heard that there would be two sequels to follow, it was like there was finally something worth living for(cinematically speaking). I've heard a lot of feedback about the second Matrix movie, most people said it sucked, that it wasn't as good as the first, or that they had an interesting concept but failed to make the proper execution and blah,blah,blah. What are these people thinking? Were they sleeping through Reloaded? Now Revolutions is here, the third and final installment in the Wachowski brothers bread and butter. I don't care about the nay sayers, Revolutions rocked. Finally, the war between the humans and machines in kicked into high gear, people other than Morpheus and Trinity start believing in Neo, and everyone is lending a helping hand. I don't know why anyone who liked the first two won't like this one. Sure, we all know it picks up where Reloaded left off, so there should be no complaints about ""poor execution"". Everyone is Zion is involved. There's not many hand to hand combat scenes and I'm a big fan of those, yet I didn't mind. I was too worried how the whole thing would play out.

","I was pretty disappointed in the final chapter of ""The Matrix"" saga. It seemed that the people behind the film was more into putting together action and not enough plot or story. If you plan on seeing this film, watch the first 2 BEFORE you do, otherwise you will get TOTALLY LOST in what is going on. Best part of the film was the action scene between Neo (Reeves)and Agent Smith (Weaving, who pretty much makes up for the disappointing film). Mary Alice takes over as The Oracle (Gloria Foster died during production). The film gets really depressing (Why was Trinity's death so long?). It seems that a lot of the story just drops off, never to be picked up. All in all, a sad way to end the saga of Neo and ""The Matrix."""
"Roddy-15","6","0","0","6 November 2003"," Perhaps it is misunderstood
","I have already criticized this film, and I am afraid that I was probably too harsh with it.<br/><br/>My comments may be saturated with spoilers, so read at your own risk.<br/><br/>There are several reasons why this film may work, but most of them are so hidden you have to think about them very carefully. First of all, we have the end of the film. At the end of the film, we see a new dawn, and we see the Oracle and the Architect talking. This new dawn symbolizes the beginning of a new Matrix, where humans and androids can co-exist and anyone is free to leave. The fact that Neo stays in the machine world means he will now control it or help to control it. He and Agent Smith were total opposites, good and evil. And Neo won the battle. The fact that Neo loses his eyes allowed him to see the machines in a new way, a beautiful way, which tells us that they weren't that bad to begin with. The conversation Neo has with two programs before that train arrives tells us that these machines feel emotions as well, and they are alive. <br/><br/>The problem with the Matrix Revolutions begins with the fact that the war to save Zion lasted way too long and had too many bullets flying and too many characters fighting, and none of these characters were well developed, so we don't care if they live or die. Neo and Trinity disappear from the film almost completely during this war. To make things worse, Trinity dies. She should have stayed in Zion and stay alive. <br/><br/>Another problem is Agent Smith. How was he defeated? Did the Oracle help? Did the machines help Neo destroy him? And where were all the answers we sought from the previous two films? Were they trapped in a second matrix? Was all this a game that Neo figured out how to end? I guess we should find the answers ourselves. The problem is that there are too many possible answer."
"Peter Elefant","8","0","0","5 November 2003"," Final chapter
","Spoilers ahead. Yes, I am that kind of guy.<br/><br/>The Matrix revolutions picks up immediately after The Matrix Reloaded. Neo is caught in a world between the matrix and the real. A trainstation largely run by the Merovingian. After some... persuation by the lovely Trinity (Well until she pulls a gun to your temple), Neo is set free, and our heros now home to defend Zion, a city under threat of annihalation by the machines.<br/><br/>Neo, getting advise from the, now changed oracle (due to the tragic death of actress Gloria Foster) ... (Morten you twit, when is a death NOT tragic!?), sets out for the Machine city with Trinity (and that's one heck of a city, if you don't mind my saying so folks!!), and Morpheus, captain Niobe our videogame friend Ghost, and others set home, to defend the city.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Agent (or should I say former agent?) Smith is taking over the Matrix, assimilating everyone (and -thing) in his way. (A true yet extreme communist).<br/><br/>And then the battle begins. Everything that has a beginning has an end.<br/><br/>I have mixed feelings about this film. On one hand I feel that the Wachowski Brothers have done right in this trilogy. Rules apply and they are following them to perfection. A trilogy must expand. Number one has the advantage of surprisal. Number two is must be bigger, faster, harder, still expanding the universe (Something forgotten in most trilogies. Like Jurassic Park, who cares if there's a bigger lizard?) Number three is the hardest, because you are concluding the story. Sacrifices have been made, and it is time to show what they have been made for.<br/><br/>The Matrix was the most surprising, and therefor the best. It dealt with discovering what is real and not, and accepting this.<br/><br/>The Matrix Reloaded was an expansion of the universe, and the ideas within the story are drawn out. This movie concerns itself with the next logical step. You have found out who and what you are. Now you must make choices.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions deals with love and death. The choices have been made, it is time to find out what you are fighting for, and carry out what you must do.<br/><br/>The trouble with The Matrix Revolutions is that too many loose ends remain when you have watched the film. You are disorientated, thinking: Who was Neo? Who was agent Smith? Who was who? Who am I? (This you don't really think, I just made that question up).<br/><br/>The brothers leave behind too many questions, and too many loose ends. They fall back on too many ""old tricks of the industry"", thus making the story of some of the characters predictable. There are some scenes in the film, that are just there for no reason.<br/><br/>The Merovingian is threatened by Trinity to hand over Neo. This happens with a gun to his temple. Trinity shows that she really loves Neo, which is fine. Just... we already knew that, now didn't we? So why do we have to watch Trinity, Morpheus and Seraph fight themselves all her way there?<br/><br/>The ending just becomes too gritty. What I always hated about StarTrek is that they always seemed to get saved in the last minute, by some technical gimmimanot, and using fancy words they explained themselves out of everything. This exact problem is what Revolutions suffers from. It get's TOO fantastic and TOO amazing, thus losing the audience completely. By the end fight, between Mr. Anderson and agent (or is that... former agent?) (Shut up, Morten you're repeating yourself) Smith, you know that something fantastic is going to happen. You just haven't a clue who is who and why.<br/><br/>On the other hand the effects are gorgeous. The Wachowski Brothers delivers what they promished, when they said they would do something new every time. Trust me. They did. The battle of Zion is one that I personally think makes the dreadfully boring Battle of Helms Deep look like a Jerry Springer stage fight (or whatever - I just liked this battle better, ok?!!)<br/><br/>They keep the philosophy in the mix between sophisticated and simple, so everyone can follow, and they stay as much away from the Matrix as they can. Everything can now be done in the Matrix, as long as Neo is doing it, so why watch, right? Right.<br/><br/>I think the ending to The MATRIX trilogy is decent. Some storypoints pull it down, while every single effect raises it to a level, where other films just seem to never get. My judgment is 8/10. Everything that has a beginning has an end... and you've never seen an ending like this."

","Back in 1999, when I first went to see ""The Matrix"", I had no idea what to expect except a sci-fi action flick. ""The Matrix"" was far from that - way above anything I had ever seen. Technically brilliant, mentally challenging, new, fresh and different. The Brothers broke every rule in the book. They forced us to ""free our minds"", strangely the tag-line of the second film, not the first.<br/><br/>In May 2003, when ""Matrix: Reloaded"" came out, expectations were high. What was to happen? How would this story move on? What amazing effects was in store for us? Again, the movie was technically brilliant, full of new challenging questions, provocative, puzzling and profound. But unlike ""The Matrix"", ""Reloaded"" was without ending. It was not a complete film, but the ""first episode"" of a story that would be told as a trilogy. It was nothing remotely close to what I expected, but no less intriguing.<br/><br/>There was ""The Animatrix"" - nine animated short stories from the matrix universe. At first glance, just a bit of fun. At second glance tons of background information into the world of the matrix, the characters and even the storyline for ""Reloaded"".<br/><br/>You could ""Enter the Matrix"" - a quite massive computer game. Kid's stuff to many, but again - that would be a misconception. The game contains about an hour of movie clips, and a full cohesive storyline running in parallel with ""Reloaded"". Stuff that helps explain the strange happenings in ""Reloaded"". Information that helps build the characters that was introduced in the second movie.<br/><br/>***WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Along came November, and once again ... expectations were high. No - let me rephrase that - expectations were enormous. Now was the time - this was the day - when questions were to be answered, explanations was to make sense of confusion and ""everything that had begun would have to end"", right? Wrong!<br/><br/>What a wonderfully naïve thought. The Warchowski brothers was to provide us with all the answers to all our questions. Fair expectations, but then again... when did the matrix trilogy ever meet expectations?<br/><br/>How could we expect, that after 4 years of trying to free our minds - bending the spoons - learning to think for ourselves - daring to analyze, to ponder, to dream and to hope, that we would be given a fact sheet of all the right answers?<br/><br/>Naïve indeed.<br/><br/>""Matrix - Revolutions"" give very few answers - or rather - very few answers to the questions we expected to be answered. Instead it brings further challenges to ponder and wonder about.<br/><br/>As it's predecessors, the movie is technically brilliant, even if some scenes tend to drag out a bit. The philosophical and religious elements are still there, some very obvious - others needing time to sink in and make sense. Still lots of ""how"", ""why"" and ""who"" in there - plenty of things to make you go ""hmmm.."" and enough things to keep the speculation going for a while.<br/><br/>Does that make it a bad movie? Not in a million years! Does it make it a difficult movie, a hard concept to grasp? Absolutely! Worth your time and money? Well ... here's the deal ...<br/><br/>In line with the movies, I would say that you have a ""choice"". But then, you have already made your choice. Know you need to try to understand why you made it.<br/><br/>The ""Matrix Trilogy"" is just that - a trilogy (in five parts, really). View it as one story - not as two or three or even five. It is, indeed, the ONE!<br/><br/>If you go ... remember this: Leave your expectations at the door. FREE YOUR MINDS! Then enjoy."

I really liked that movie, and it was obvious how it inspired other moviemakers. Then I heard about the two upcoming sequels. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" was a little bit of a disappointment, even though the intelligence of the original wasn't left, it still had some of the original feeling. And earlier this evening I saw the last part in the trilogy, ""The Matrix Revolutions"". It was a real disappointment, because of so many reasons. For example, there is no intelligence in the plot, the action scenes are so unbelievable and they have not the feeling that the fighting scenes of the original movie. The only scenes I really liked was the scenes with the Train Man, and some parts of the end fight between Neo and Smith. I don't want to spoil anything from the movie, so I won't say anything more. But my advice is this: Instead of going to the cinema to watch this movie, lay back at home and watch ""The Matrix"", and pretend that there aren't any sequels.  ""The Matrix"" is a really good movie, despite it's sequels. I don't like to complain, but I'm afraid I had to do it this time. Excuse me, if my judgement is wrong."

","Ok, let me start off by saying that this is th least impressive of the three movies in the trilogy. Putting that aside, it is still a great movie, and I'm happy with the outcome. This movie didn't have all of the psychology that the first two movies had, but you have to remember that this really is the same movie as the second one. So, where Reloaded had a lot of the build up to the action, this one has all of the action. Many people might find this movie to be a bummer, because of the end. However, if you are intelligent enough to realize that the Matrix draws a lot of comparisons to Christian theology, and that Neo parrallels Jesus, then the end isn't that much of a suprise. <br/><br/>The huge Zion battle scene was one of the most awe inspiring things I have ever witnessed in a movie. When all the sentinels finally break into Zion I just sat there with my mouth wide open saying ""Wow."" It was an awesome thing to look at. Also, the fight scene with Neo and Agent Smith was absolutely incredible. <br/><br/>There were only a couple of problems that I had with the movie. First, I did wish there was a little more of the story that actually took place inside the Matrix. It was very little in this movie. Also, at times, I felt the Zion set looked a little cheap or cheasy. It didnt' bother me that much.<br/><br/>In the long run while this is the weakest in the trilogy, it was still great. I feel it finished the story the only way that it really could. A must see. 8 stars out of 10."

","I don't know what people were expecting from this movie. I think everyone was expecting something different to happen. Everything that is supposed to happen that was said was going to happen in the other films happens. Do people not like the way it happened? Everything feels like everyone is capable of doing more than their character does. Like Neo for instance, he mostly has the role of fighting and he always does it really well. But yet, it feels like he is about to make a break through to something else, but never does. This movie revolves so much more around everyone else other than Neo. It's worth watching everyone struggle, so much passion in everyone. So much love in it with everyone, you can really feel it. That made me feel happy in a sad way. The last fight scene by far is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in a live action movie. But i won't give it a 10 just because of that. It was like watching an anime. A beautiful, very well done Anime. Still I simply feel like I've been hit over the head really hard with something not hard like a bat, but more like a bulky big back pack, and I don't feel like saying anything back to the people that did it, because it felt good in a way, but not really. It's just like you walk away cause you cant stay behind, you simply have to move on. I can just say I wish this movie had been better although it was pretty good. I wish I could love it, but I cant."

","Saw the flick opening day, third show of the day. I went in with little expectations. After all, I loved the first, like the second, and was somewhat put off by the direction they were heading. I pretty much figured out what was going to happen from watching Reloaded several times.<br/><br/>THERE WILL BE MANY SPOILERS COMING...<br/><br/>	So, to digress slightly, #1 was and opening, giving us the basic outline and introducing characters. A great flick, definitely one of the all-time great scifi's. #2 moved the story along, but wasn't near as groundbreaking. The story lines weren't all that. #3should be the climax, the conclusion. But we are left with a huge hole that isn't filled. So why... 	Well, to the makers credit, they made a decent film. Sure most of the acting is stilted, and the dialogue is corny, but it is somewhat great in it's own right. As a part of The Matrix story though, it's dull, muddled and ultimately unsatisfying. Look at the titles. The Matrix Reloaded, pretty much what it implies, more and more of what made the first so good. Maybe a little too much. The Matrix Revolutions, huh, did I miss something, there was no revolution folks, Revelations, ok there were a few of those, but no revolutions. And this is just for starters... 	The first had all the mythology, and pseudo-religious overtones. The third reveals that all of that was pretty much a lie. It's all based in a man/machine world. The Cynics of Zion were correct, he is no savior. He's an extremely poor negotiator. The end of the film pretty much blows away everything the brothers had worked so hard to establish in the first. Love, faith, the enduring spirit of man, are all cast aside by Neo in the end. At the end of the first, he said I'm going to show them what you don't want them to see', and he delivers. We saw an extremely unsatisfying conclusion. Neo forsake the people of Zion, and the folks caught up in the world of the Matrix, to help the machines conquer an out of control program that they helped create. 	Hello! The title is Revolutions. There was no revolution. The great battle ended without a victor. Just a very fragile treaty.  The Architect says those who want, will be set free. This is garbage to the extreme. Mankind by nature does not want to be kept in bondage, and these weren't the conclusions so easily defined in #1. But now it's apparent that Neo isn't working for Zion, he is a machine. So everything stated in #1 about faith and believing was all lies. Morpheus was duped, all the believers were.  We should have at least been shown the aftermath in Zion when everyone found out what it was exactly that Neo did. It seems Cypher was right all along, better to be reinserted into the Matrix, then live he way they were. Morphues would have been strung up by his Buster Browns.<br/><br/>	Why do I say all this? Because now it has to start all over again. And this is where filmmaking bugs me. In 5 or 6 years, a new set of (cheap) actors, More money spent on Special Effects, less on story development, (it's done now), to tell the whole darn thing again. Why? Because the Architect says so. It has to be done to keep the Matrix in balance, or whatevr he calls it. This Matrix had no conclusion. It was supposed to be rebuilt, and never was. The fields will still be grown for harvesting, and eventually those in bondage will get the same sense that Trinity and the others got in the first. Someone has to stand up and say, Let my people go'. It's human nature. 	We are the cattle. And the brothers are the herdsmen. I will not be pushed down a chute."

","While ""The Matrix"" battled with the concept of determinism, and ""Reloaded"" wrestled on with issues surrounding free will and choice, ""Revolutions"" became the battle ground for two camps of Existentialist philosophy.<br/><br/>Movie-goers who don't have a background in philosophy, beware. Enjoy the ride and the FX, and try to talk this out with friends.<br/><br/>The philosophy:<br/><br/>There is a field of philosophy called Existentialism. In very general terms, they argue that you create your own reality. They believe that your life is in your control.<br/><br/>There are camps in Existentialist philosophy. There is a group that believes that life has no meaning, no purpose. There is another group that believes it is every human's responsibility to create a purpose for him/herself.<br/><br/>In ""Revolutions"", the 'life has no meaning/purpose' camp is represented by Smith, who has unfortunately taken over the Matrix. (No wonder it has become such a gloomy place!) The 'choose to make purpose/meaning' camp is represented by Neo. He chooses to be there, he chooses to fight.<br/><br/>It would seem that the Wachowski brothers are arguing that we have choice, but only a limited amount of choice, because in the end Neo cannot escape the apparently inevitable fate of the One. But in the whole process, he is able to choose a third path that wasn't offered to him by the Architect/the Machines in ""Reloaded"".<br/><br/>Are there a lot of special effects and explosions in ""Revolutions""? Absolutely. Is there a message in ""Revolutions""? Absolutely. Will everyone who goes to see the movie get the message? Probably not.

The Matrix Reloaded mostly tried to fix the plot holes of the first movie, but still had some very very nice effects. The Matrix Revolutions plain sucked. The acting was horrible and so was the dialogue. At most the dialogue was hilarious (although it wasn't trying to be). The effects weren't nearly as stunning as they were in the first or second movies of the series. Even the last big fighting scene was ruined with so unrealistic scenes that it wasn't even entertaining to watch anymore.

","Well I finally saw the Matrix 3, and I must say that I was kind of disappointed.  This is coming from someone who was truly impressed after seeing the second Matrix.  But the third Matrix lacked intrigue, and here is why...<br/><br/>I don't think I need to say that the first Matrix was very original and well worth watching numerous times.  After it ended, I expected the second Matrix to be without plot or interest.  I assumed that it would be a purely action based movie with nothing other than special effects holding it together. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that the second Matrix had some unexpected twists and turns.  I must say that I was quite impressed by the second Matrix movie.<br/><br/>So when Revolutions came out I changed my expectations from low to fairly high.  That was my first mistake.  I should have realized that there was no good way to end this trilogy.  The writers spent all of Reloaded digging themselves into a hole.  It became clear in Revolutions that there was no real way to end the movie in a way that was interesting.  So the movie just sort of ended, leaving a stunned crowd trying to figure out what went wrong. <br/><br/>Now, I won't go so far as to say that the movie was bad, because I don't believe that it was bad.  But I will say that when compared to the first and second Matrix, this movie did not stack up.  I still liked the special effects and the fight scenes.  But that was all that there was to hold on to when the movie was over.  The Matrix Revolutions was pretty close to what I thought the second Matrix was going to be before I saw it.  A mindless movie that focuses only on special effects.  So the reason I walked out disappointed was due to my expectations.  Had the second movie been a mindless action fest, I would have probably liked the third one.  But because the second movie was interesting, I couldn't enjoy the third one nearly as much.  When it comes right down to it, there was no good way to end this movie.  I can't think of a single scenario that would have saved this movie from being a let down.  At least we still have the first Matrix to hold on to."

","First of all this movie didn't suck. Neither was it any good. The story is lacking to say the least.

But Monicas ""Twins"" did pull this movie out of a * out of *** to a ** out of ***. I was hoping for one of the most excellent movies ever, maybe that is why I thought this movie was such a big disappointment. There were no new real answers or paradigm shifts, just the same stuff we had been served since the previous movies. The story went nowhere fast, and stayed there. Just to have a pretty dull ending with no feeling of an end, maybe they wanted that but the Wachowski brothers could have managed to do it better than THIS. The special effects were pretty good, but eye-candy is not a substitute for a good storyline. As a movie it isn't all that bad, I have seen much worse, however it would not have . But as a part of the trilogy it is a horrible mistake. Reloaded had better fight scenes and a more suitable pace, and it had the revelations of the Matrix and ""The One"". The first one stands out as a truly visionary film. But this one is the lesser of both by a lot."

I can't help feeling that Reloaded and Revolutions could have been easily edited into one movie if the Wachowski brothers had really worked at it. Both films seemed padded out; the rave scenes in Zion (Reloaded) and the battle of Zion<br/><br/>(Revolutions) could have been paired back. Action and special effects overwhelm everything else.<br/><br/>The Matrix was great but it should have been left there. The idea was never developed in a way that could satisfy like the original did and the only things left to enjoy were the amazing action sequences.

"NoArrow","10","0","0","6 November 2003"," Entertaining and exciting sequel to a visually stunning series...
","...""The Matrix Revolutions"" is the last installment of one of the greatest action series of all time.  This time around the plot focuses on Neo's (Keannu Reeves) search for answers, the war between Zion and the machines and the evil Agent Smith's (Hugo Weaving) growing power.  All the while it is filled with action, adventure and excitement.<br/><br/>Ever since ""Reloaded"" reviewers and people alike have been complaining about how disappointing the series has become.  I disagree with them completely. The first Matrix was thrilling and new, the second was fun and full of mystery, the third is nail-biting excitement and full of answers.  I don't think ""Revolutions"" could have ended the series any better than it did.<br/><br/>There are still flaws, of course, but only minor.  A few cheesy scenes of dialogue, Keannu Reeves' acting, and (spoiler!) some bad drama in the killing of Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), but the pros outweigh the cons.  This is an action movie, and that's how it delivers.  From the fire-scorched battle scenes in Zion to Neo's climactic fight with Agent Smith to Seraph's (Colin Chou, in the coolest role of the movie) greater importance, this never disappoints.<br/><br/>That said, I still have to say that anyone going to the theater shouldn't expect anything as good as the first, or anything really powerful and dramatic, just an intensely fun and exciting action movie.  And the gunfight between Morpheus, Trinity, Seraph and The Merovingian's thugs...well, it doesn't get much better!<br/><br/>I'm disappointed with its low rating (6.5), but I think I know that it will climb up in the near future, 8/10"

","I've read quite a lot of mixed reviews on Revolutions and I'm honestly not surprised.  The moment I saw this movie I knew people were most likely going to either love it or hate it.  Personally, I loved it.<br/><br/>While Reloaded tried too hard to be everything viewers were expecting, Revolutions went beyond that and took us exactly where the story was intended to go in the first place.  <br/><br/>For the action fans, Revolutions has some seriously exhilarating action sequences that, while using ""bullet-time"", didn't OVER use it as in Reloaded.<br/><br/>For those interested in the story, Revolutions had the cerebral aspect so prevalent in the first film, yet missing in Reloaded.<br/><br/>That being said, the two came together in a powerful third chapter of the Matrix trilogy.  To be honest, the first half hour to fourty-five minutes of the movie were, granted, a bit slow.  But from there it picked up the pace and kept it at an elevated level for all to enjoy...never quite missing a beat or falling back on lame cliches and Hollywood ""sunset"" endings.<br/><br/>For the most part, the loose ends from Reloaded are tied up quite well and leave the audience with a satisfactory ""aaah, I get it"" feeling.  Some may find the ending a bit ambiguous, however, but if you paid close attention to the full series, it will be quite clear.<br/><br/>Do not read further if you are not interested in spoilers or an my interpretation of the ending...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
________BEGIN SPOILERS________<br/><br/>The Oracle had stated ""all things that have a beginning must come to an end"" and that Smith, basically, is the ""anti-Neo"".  He is Neo...only the opposite version of him.  At the end of the movie Smith stated the same thing the Oracle had regarding all things ending.  Neo then knew what he needed to do. He allowed himself to be taken over by Smith, thus ""choosing"" (choice being an important theme throughout the trilogy) to ""end"" himself.  If Neo no longer exists, than neither can the ""anti-Neo"" for the only reason Smith (anti-Neo) existed in the first place was really BECAUSE of Neo.  Sounds a bit confusing, granted, but after watching all three (and, really, the Animatrix) it all falls into place.  It wasn't the machines that destroyed Smith.  It was Neo basically sacrificing himself to end his anti-self.<br/><br/>
I have to admit I liked the way the entire series ended.  Had either side simply obliterated the other, I'd have been very disappointed.  Instead, both sides were able to live in ""peace"" which was what the machines really wanted in the first place (watch the Animatrix and you'll learn this). Furthermore, not everyone was ""freed"" from the Matrix.  Actually, you could miss this point since they stated it so swiftly.  Those that choose to leave, can, but those that wish to stay, can remain within the Matrix. Again coming full circle back to the point of the two pills from the first movie.<br/><br/>The ending was a great way to allow closure to the trilogy without spoon-feeding or hand-holding the audience.  It also provided a satisfactory end to a great series without getting overly cheesy or becoming cliche.<br/><br/>________END SPOILERS________<br/><br/>
All in all, Revolutions was fantastic.  The acting was good (not superb, but not awful in the least), the action was incredible, the storyline was well played out and delivered and the special effects were, indeed, special.  I know there are going to be those that hate this movie for various reasons, but put aside any expectations or pre-conceived notions and let the ending take you where the storyline is SUPPOSED to go.  All in all, 9 out of 10 stars."

","Okay, first things first:  The Matrix Revolutions is much better than Reloaded.  There is much less dialogue, much more action, and there is NO underground orgy scene (thank GOD).  But, there still feels like something's missing in this ""finale"" to the trilogy.<br/><br/>(MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD)<br/><br/>1)  The beginning of Revolutions is extremely slow.  It takes the movie a good 45 minutes before anything really happens.  There is one great fight between Trinity and an agent that emulates the fights from the first film, but other than that, the beginning is mostly Keannu Reeves stuck in a bland, white train station waiting for the ""train man.""  Uh... okay.<br/><br/>2.  Once the war begins, the movie is nothing but action, which for the most part is great.  But sometimes the CGI is so intense that it's hard to tell what's going on.  I wasn't the only one in the theatre that kept asking ""who was that?"" and ""what just happened?""<br/><br/>3.  The plot is somewhat predictable--yes, there are deaths, and it's not tough to figure out who dies in this movie.  I won't spoil it here, although I'm sure there are other reviews that already have.  But the death scenes themselves are extremely drawn out and melodramatic.  One in particular drags on and becomes a total ""Titanic""-sized good-bye scene that had people laughing more than crying.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is entertaining.  But after the excitement of the action dies off, it becomes more apparent that the sequels really weren't as original as the first Matrix.  They borrow heavily on other science fiction movies, such as Dune and even Aliens.  (Those things the human army wore--did anyone else keep waiting for them to shout ""Get away from her you bitch!""?)<br/><br/>My recommendation:  go into this movie expecting some cool action sequences, cheesy dialogue, unintentionally funny moments, and a great final battle scene between Neo and Agent Smith, and you won't be let down."

","Finally have I seen, the last chapter in the Matrix trilogy. Was it any good? Yeah, it was great. So much better then Reloaded, but not as good as the original. But what is? Nothing. The original caught us with a surprise and invented something new. Something we had never seen. Something we just have seen parts of in manga and Hong Kong action and kung fu movies. It was perfectly blended and we loved it. It could never been done in the same way, and the Wachowski's hasn't even tried. Because the couldn't. They did there best and gave us a spectacular and fantastic sci-fi/action movie. They show a war against the machine we could only dream about years ago. But the Wachowki's gave us that, and I love them for it. The Zion attack was great. It was one of the most impressive action sequence I have ever scene in that scale. Much better than you have seen in any Star Wars film or manga movies. The only thing that can top this is if we got a Terminator 4 in the future where we see a full scale battle between thousand and thousand of machine against thousand's of human. That would top this. But for now we got Revolutions.<br/><br/>SPOILERS (don't read if you haven't seen the movie)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The fight between Neo and Agent Smith was great. It could have been better if we could see what was going on, and it hadn't been raining and so dark. But the sequence was great. They took it to the next level. They made Agent Smith, super Agent Smith. And how did he become that? He took over the oracle. And it was brilliant. It was perfect love how I become this super agent. I no other way that he could match Neo.<br/><br/>The first half in the matrix was also great. But it could been better. I wanted to see more action in the s & m club. I big shoot out. The shoot out was great, and I thought it always would be cool if Trinity and Morpheus could fight other free minded  or other programs than the agent or the twins. The first half reminded me much of the original Matrix. I got the same feeling.<br/><br/>On the down side we got terrible dialogue. I could see a lot of it coming a mile away. We got a lot of new characters that we don't remember the names off. Neo was a little stupid. It took a while before he knew that Bane was Agent Smith. I wanted to scream to the screen that Bane was Agent Smith. Who else will call him Mr. Anderson? It would also be cool to have a Seraph and Agent Smith fight, because I think Seraph would kick Smith's behind. That would be before he become Super Smith. I think Morepheus could do more in this film. His part is pretty small, and he hasn't much to do. Jada Pinkett Smith's character Niobi is all most bigger.<br/><br/>All in all I like this a lot more than Reloaded. It didn't feel so empty as Reloaded, and I felt every action had a meaning. In the end I was satisfied. I feel it answered all my question, and it didn't raise any new one. I liked that Neo and Trinity died, and I think the Wachowski's couldn't do it any other way. The music by Don Davis and Juno Reactor was also cool, and I liked it. I was satisfied by the acting. Nothing big, but nothing bad either. They are there characters. Revolutions could have a sequel, but it doesn't need it. If they make one, it should be set in about 100 years later or more.<br/><br/>I gave it 8/10. A improvement from Reloaded, but it couldn't never be as good as The Matrix. (I'm sorry about any grammatic or spelling mistakes)"

Most notable are: the brief skirmish in Club Hell, with bondage gear-clad baddies flip to the ceiling to battle Morpheus, Trinity and Seraph; and the Battle of Zion which lets the viewer bask in glorious carnage. The Real World sequences are glorious, with the Machine City in particular, being a real treat. The psychobabble from Reloaded is trimmed to a minimum (thankfully) and The Architect is only given one small scene right at the end.<br/><br/>Anyway my dears, I've waffled on for far too long, but I urge you all strongly to avoid the negative fools who bask in the defeat of others, and enjoy this film!<br/><br/>Yours,<br/><br/>Doomboy."

","I just saw the movie and there is little that I remember (or liked). The film wanted to be something it was not. It wanted to be a war movie but couldn't cope It wanted to be a religion but couldn't cope<br/><br/>Whats even worse: It didnt even try to be Matrix 1. It didnt even try to have a deeper meaning (Reloaded hinted it might just hold some mindblowing answers).<br/><br/>What was it then? Well, take a bunch of popcorn a huge coke, some candy and go eat it during you watch. Then maybe its enjoyable.<br/><br/>It was a sad ending to the Matrix saga.. sad in the sence that, watching it, you remembered how you felt when you first saw these effects and first heard the philosophy. But they weren't in this movie, they were all in Matrix 1.<br/><br/>If you definitely want to see it, pay as little as possible or you'll miss your money. I'll give it 2 out of 10 (because the mech's really were neat and there was a really cool bullet-time scene where Neo hit agent Smith)."

","---Warning! Some Major Spoilers May Lie Ahead!---<br/><br/>I went to see the third part of this movie trilogy without a clue what's going to happen. All I had was possible story finishes that I've had made up in my head after seeing ""Matrix Reloaded"".<br/><br/>It would show that this was a great thing to do. I sat really excited the whole movie, because anything could happen. I realized that the ending was open the whole time, because there were no rules for how the film was going to end. Some times it even seemed that the trilogy would get a really unique ending, seen from the eyes of Hollywood movie makers that is. But that wasn't how it was going to be. Sure, it has a bittersweet ending after all, but it's really more a happy ending seen from my eyes.<br/><br/>You could say that the more mysterious parts of the trilogy have gone more and more downwards for every film. The first film was really philosophic, while the ""Matrix Reloaded"" combined it pretty good with astonishing effects in high-tempo scenes. This third constellation is really even more of an action flick than the second one was.<br/><br/>Still, approx. 2 hours after the world premiere ending, I must say that I enjoyed ""Revolutions"" more than ""Reloaded"". I think the reason was the intense storytelling of the finale. ""The Matrix"" was kind of meant to be a little bit of a low-toned story, but in the already mentioned ""mix"" of genres in ""Reloaded"" you tend to become a little bit tired of watching in the slow parties. In ""Revolutions"", you won't even have time to blink! It's so packed with action and special effect sequences that you sometimes wonder how the screen can take it without exploding as well!<br/><br/>All-in-all, the movie is a worthy finish for the trilogy. It's a little bit too unlike the earlier movies, but it really keeps you glued to your seat. And believe me: The less you know before you see it, the better it gets!<br/><br/>So I hope you read this review AFTER you watched it..."

","Before I get into the why, let me warn you in case you don't read past the spoiler warning. This movie was awful and I LOVED the first two.<br/><br/>
***POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW!!!*** <br/><br/>What is there to say that hasn't been said already? Someone else commented saying that he'd never seen an audience that was more let down. I agree. We were practically embarrassed to be there. I used to think there couldn't be a greater letdown than the new Star Wars movies (which I like, but they were still a disappointment) but this movie has, in two hours, managed to become the number one in my hall of shame and retroactively ruin the previous two movies. <br/><br/>There's nothing, NOTHING I hate more than getting to the end of a movie and feeling as if the antagonists have been nothing but mere spectators and were unable to create any real impact. What's worse is sitting through two movies that make you think there will be resolution when there is none. Great. An epic has become a nothing. The movies should not have ever happened because they told a story with no resolution. No real ending. No purpose. No nothing. <br/><br/>Revolutions was rushed. It shot right through without the payoff of extra cool action like we got in the second one. Morpheous was lame in this movie. He was just kind of a weak gimp along for the ride. Trinity dies, more or less, senselessly. Neo's martyrdom is for NOTHING! The Matrix isn't solved. Zion is still at the mercy of the machines.<br/><br/>Really, the big winners are the sentient programs. That's it.<br/><br/>Nothing was solved, but nothing really mattered. If that's your mantra then I suggest you see a GOOD movie that delivers the message. It's called Fight Club! It never brands itself an epic and it doesn't try to hide behind anything it isn't. What has the Matrix taught us? We're slaves to poor movie makers! I HATE THIS MOVIE!!!<br/><br/>If you haven't seen any of the Matrix movies yet, do yourself a favor. Watch the first one, enjoy it for all that it is and pretend that it ends there, that way you'll still be able to enjoy it again."

I was one of few who loved Reloaded, mostly because of the intellect it took to make the Architect's scene. Revolutions, however, was a major disappointment.  The action wasn't surprising in the least.  The only topic having to do with philosophy was the issue of ""choice"" which was already introduced in Reloaded.  And intellect?

","I'll be honest, I don't normally write stuff on here, but this time either I'm bored, or I'm just compelled.  What follows is my honest opinion, filled with a couple of spoilers.<br/><br/>I loved the film up until the last 3 or 4 minutes, then I was nothing but let down.  I was completely blown away by everything I saw, which is rare for me.  I loved how the plot fit together, and how it all worked...but the ending was horrendous.  Sure, there were tons of plots holes if you look for them.  In reloaded, they begged for ships to be left behind, there wasn't a single ship inside Zion, what was all that build up for?  The machines sure were intent on stopping Neo and Trinity from getting to what I believe was Zero One, but after they got in, why did they stop their resistance?  And then the end....  All that build up....  And the didn't even win...they fought for all that, and got a draw?<br/><br/>Beyond that, love the tie in with the animatrix, the kid that 'saved himself' it was really nice to know his story while watching him run around. Loved the homages, the mech's looking alot like the one from Aliens, while it the machines have a very Alien feel.  The warehouse in which Neo and Smith continue their fight, that HAD to be an homage to Highlander, it sure felt like it was.<br/><br/>All in all, its a spectacular film, but know this, its not an end, its a beginning.  Its an end to the WAR, but the beginning of humanity again. It left me with too many questions for an End.... What happened to the matrix itself?  Do the machines still commit the atrocity that is using people for power?  It was an end to the war against Zion, not against the machines.... Maybe there will be another Animatrix to sort it all out...."

It's never explained how some things are able to happen. Don't see this in the theaters. Definitely watch it on DVD, but only to get some closure to the trilogy. You're not missing anything else otherwise. Everything that was a staple of the other movies is missing. Weak plot, too much confusion, very few fight scenes and even those are ridiculous.

","The latest installment of the matrix trilogy (arguably the best of all trilogies) was no less entertaining or a visual spectacle than it's predecessors. And in true matrix fashion, it leaves the viewers with more questions than answers. (Possible spoilers ahead!!!) A great movie! However there were more than a handful of corny lines....... (what's with the 'U know what's changed in the last six hours? Nothing!) These lines definitely hamper the flow of the movie and are terribly out of place.... The scene of the first attack on Zion was absolutely amazing. One can only speculate what has finally happened to Neo (has he died or just temporarily shocked??). The little girl's character also leaves plenty of scope for discussion...... (i really dont grasp the significance of it). Like any classic sci-fi (if matrix can actually be classified thus) the possibilities are endless.... there will ofcourse be plently of speculation if this movie was indeed a fitting finale given that 'reloaded' left most fans rather disappointed. I think that revolutions lives up to all expectations and then some more.....<br/><br/>

","OK this was bad really bad. Ok I'm over exaggerating a bit, but it was not what I expected.

Pretty much, Neo saves the day, the end. No twists, nothing new from Reloaded.<br/><br/>As in Reloaded, the acting was quite poor, no emotion on the actors/actresses faces, no real emotion that humans would show in this situation. Another poor acting performance from Keanu Reeves with some lines almost laughable.<br/><br/>The special effects were good, you cannot deny that and there was a lot of action but this film is only good for that. If you just want to watch a mind numbing film of explosions and robots, this is for you but I really do think it has lost the original ""The Matrix""'s class, storyline and unique being as a film.<br/><br/>Oh well, see it, you will see what I mean. So many questions unanswered due to the lack of story."

","Just coming from the world premier, I must say: Wow. The second installment (Reloaded) was seen as a great disappointment by many. Whether or not one submits to this etiquette, it's undeniable to see the epic-feel of Revolutions once you see it. The battles between man and machine, Neo vs. Smith, the intensity and grand scheme of these battles are nearly impossible to put into words.<br/><br/>And above all that, yes, the movie has a plot; an excellent plot, I may add. As I do not wish to spoil anything for anyone, I'll say that you have to see it just to comprehend. It explains, but unlike Reloaded, Revolutions flows.

"PlanecrazyIkarus","Null","0","0","6 November 2003"," The Matrix Regurgitated
","Whenever a review is read or written, the frame of mind of the reviewer should be considered: I am a fan of the Matrix (it's my favourite movie), I loved Reloaded and for a brief time even thought it was better than the original Matrix, and so I had giant anticipation for Revolutions.<br/><br/>So, of course, it was easy to be badly disappointed. Reloaded took about half an hour to get going, but then it delivered a very big, enjoyable action movie. The Matrix Revolutions takes two hours to get going, and then it delivered a very brief enjoyable end to the trilogy. See the problem? Two hours of movie, five minutes of end, and only the latter is quality - that's not good!<br/><br/>Let's begin with a brief synopsis: The machines are still digging for Zion. Neo is still not quite sure who or what he is. And there still is an oracle, the Gandalf of this series, waiting to meddle with everything. Oh yes, and Smith is Smithifying every human inhabitant of the Matrix. So, essentially, we're back in Reloaded. Revolutions then delivers a giant battle in the real world. This is disappointing, because the good thing about the Matrix movies is that they offer a justification for delivering insane action (it's virtual, rules can be broken, etc.) and now they set up battle-mech fights in the supposed real world? That is the point where audience acceptance (or suspension of disbelief) is lost. You just get the notion that the Wachowskis like playing computer games and wanted to see these funky robot-things do battle properly with big guns, so they did it. There is no other justification for the big battle, other than it might look cool (personally, I thought it sucked all the fun out of the movie).<br/><br/>So, the movie includes a giant battle that disappoint - fine, what else is there? And this is where you realize how Revolutions went wrong: It has far less substance than the previosu two instalments. You have a chase through service tunnels, you have a small action-set-piece inside the Matrix revisiting the MerylLynchian (or whatever is name is), and while that scene started out very good (the guy actually offers them a deal) it ends in a disappointing copout. Then there's Neo's confrontation with Smith, and that's about it. Battle, Chase, MerylLynchian, Fight, End. Battle is bad, chase is boring (just lots of woman-can-drive humour) MerylLynchian loses his cool and the fight is too brief end repetitive. The end is great, though.<br/><br/>To be honest, my fingers are literally itching with the desire to write the movie the way it should have been done - there was so much potential here, and so much that could have been truly revolutionary. Instead, we got a movie that is stupid for most of its duration, hopelessly corny in the Neo/Trinity scenes and annoying until the only redeeming feature, the end.<br/><br/>Don't hold your breath for this one, you will be disappointed. 5/10 (for effort, the Smith/Neo battle and the end)"

","No Spoilers Here<br/><br/> To start off for anyone who immediately wants to know at which point of the Matrix ladder I think this film stands, it's the second best, with Reloaded as the worst Matrix movie.<br/><br/> The plot: Pretty good. Although the main plot is pretty predictable, the plots underneath the main one are really great, and hold some great, new ideas, instead of the somewhat cliché ideas in Reloaded (which were great, too). All questions you have will be answered, but the great spiritual mystery luckily holds up, and remain unanswered, unless you are really into Buddhism/Gnosticism.<br/><br/>Action: The action feels very fresh, and is at some points revolutionary. 'Matrix (Reloaded)'-like action is not repeated at all. Very fluid fights, great mechanical action, and oh so much suspense, which Reloaded really missed. Where Reloaded was eyepopping action (just for fun), Revolutions has brutal, more pure action. Really thrilling.<br/><br/>Dialogue: Again, this is what sci-fi guys are worst at. The dialogue IS very good, except when it comes to love n stuff. It feels dry, sometimes depthless. But, fear not, the love story itself is strong enough to support the less dialogue, and so, it does not matter. All the other dialogue is, well, excellent, superb. Some memorable quotes here.<br/><br/>Tilt: This is really the first Matrix movie where you really get sucked into the universe of it all. Don't get me wrong, I got sucked into The Matrix '99 as well, but more in an coolness kind of way, like: 'Wow that is so cool, I wanna do that.' But this movie gets you deeper, because of the lighting and great film angles.<br/><br/> A must-see ofcourse, for any of those who want to know the end. Despite some really disappointing dialogue, which occurs only a few times, the movie is great, the action is great, the special effects are the best I've ever seen, this film is almost a classic."

","If Reloaded was about life, this addresses death.  True, it addresses the death of The Matrix as a successful trilogy.  Never before have I felt so let down and disappointed with this shoddy movie that is covered over by special effects.  Nothing was answered, in fact more questions were created and not in the way in which we could work it out for ourselves, we're talking total confusion.  The film is visually stunning, but predictable and there is nothing new about it.  Although it is a good epic war film, it uses every cheezy cliche imaginable to do this.<br/><br/>The only real brilliance is Hugo Weaving, who plays the role of Agent Smith and confirms him as one of cinemas all time evil bad guys.  The rest of the cast are plain and rarely get into the character they are portraying, with exception to Jada Pinkett-Smith who plays Niobi very well.<br/><br/>The main disappointment about this movie is that it is called Revolutions but nothing is concluded aside from the obvious.  If you are a die hard fan that knows all the ins and outs of the Matrix philosophy, you may be able to decypher all the questions I simply could not answer, however I wouldn't get your hopes up.

It's an action - science fiction movie with some really spectacular scenes and some other scenes really boring, but those aren't too many at least. I think it's worth to see it after the disappointment for the second one, but don't expect to watch a movie as splendid as the first one."

"ahdvd","9","0","0","5 November 2003"," Superb end to a trilogy. THIS is how live Anime should be!
","The Matrix Revolutions is a unique movie experience that should be seen un-spoiled, hence this review will be as spoiler free as it can be without being too vague.<br/><br/>For those who i have heard commenting on this movie saying that it was bad i have to ask ""what movie were you watching?!"". This is a terrific and thrilling movie that continues where The Matrix and Reloaded left off, bringing the story to a wonderful end, that for once doesn't fill in all the gaps and leaves us wondering what the future may hold for this world the Wachowski's have created.<br/><br/>People seem to be forgetting that this movie is the second half of a whole, Reloaded being the first half, setting up most of what happens and comes to completion in this movie.<br/><br/>Some have said there is no characterisation, and that the dialogue is corny, but as far as i was concerned there was characterisation, you just need to watch for it, and the ""corny"" dialogue(which for the most part was in character) existed for a purpose, which was to relieve the tension that builds for the most part of the film, something that is required for the audience to be able to stay with the movie and not have a heart attack.<br/><br/>The majority of this movie takes place in the real world and not in the matrix, which i found to be a refreshing change, making the threat during the battle for zion come accross as truly man's last stand for freedom, and even existance.<br/><br/>While some may consider the special effects over the top and unnecessary, they are entirely intended to be so, showing the scale of the treat and how many ""sentinels"" the human resistance must fight off, and the work done in this film is unmatched by ANY other film or scene i can recall(George Lucas, watch this and take note, this is how star wars episodes 1 and 2 should have looked and felt, and you may come out topps for episode 3). The fight between Neo and Smith is one of the effects that truly shows what a battle of the gods would be like.<br/><br/>Overall I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish, this is the way that all Manga/Anime type movies should aim to be, and I for one will be seeing it again very soon and hope that it will be remembered as one of the best conclusions to a trilogy. 10 stars out of 10."
"heyitsad","Null","0","0","6 November 2003"," A 2 hour and 9 minute movie where the 9 minutes kill it...(only one minor spoiler in here)
","By far, this movie for the first two hours was matching the first Matrix in excitment.  I had heard all the reviews, heard all the disappointments, and went in with low expectations based upon that.  About an hour into it, I was thinking, ""what are they all talking about, this movie is incredible."" While Morpheus takes on a different role in this movie then the previous two, and while new characters emerge and others take a back burner, I was engrossed into it just the same.  Minor spoiler -> (I felt the acting in just one scene in the first two hours, was pretty poor, where the boy, who is 16, tries to pass as 18 and join the ""army"".) But, other than that, the plot, score, choreography, and acting was superb.  BUT THEN, that last 9 minutes or so of the movie.  So much could have been done different in this movie to conclude the trilogy.  Did not we all expect the movie to end with a strange twist similar to how it all began?  Well, at least that's what I was thinking.  I don't want to spoil the ending so I won't reveal any spoilers.  I do want to say this though.  I think that the ending SHOULD HAVE BEEN something like this... ""Neo and Trinity jack in prior  to going to the ""machine world"", once they realize that Smith must be defeated before its too late and before Smith takes over everything.  Neo and Trinity battle Smith together as Smith has gotten so powerful and Smith gives Trinity a blow that essentially all but kills her as she is on her last breaths. Smith, with his witty and dry humor tells Neo that it must hurt feeling the human emotion of love as he watches her die.  Neo then looks within himself and discovers another source of power so strong that he uses it to defeat Agent Smith forever.  Neo hobbles over to Trinity and tells her he can't do this alone and touches her with his hands and gives her life once again.  He and trinity come out of being jacked in to the Matrix and take the ship to the machine world where they find the central source of what has scarred the sky and and has changed the face of the planet.  Basically the brain or the machines and the source of the machines power.  Along the way there, Neo must use his inner power to stop attacks from the machines coming at them and grows stronger as he does this.  Neo and Trinity realize that they must use the machine on the ship which kills all machines and renders them useless.  Neo and Trinity crash the ship after sustaining too much damage just outside the permiter of where the central unit of this machine world is.  Neo and Trinity carry the ""weapon"" towards the central unit and in one final battle between machines and man, Neo discovers he has full use of the ""powers"" he has in the Matrix, in this world also.  In the last scene, we see a simulatneous scene where all the machines surround Neo and Trinity getting ready to press the button to terminate thet machines, the machines come into attack Neo, Trinity presses the button, and there's a flash, and Neo wakes up in the same scene as the first movie with the computer screen flashing and it appears that the whole movie has gone back around in one complete loop and then the credits start rolling...""  That would be my type of ending..."

","Sure, the Matrix will be remembered for its sheer uniqueness in a decade full of repetitious films; Reloaded had some great qualities within the convoluted storyline (great action sequences, um, a great car chase)... but seriously, why in the world would anyone let Revolutions out into the world? This is the most worthless religious parable I have ever seen, and it belongs in the dumpster, never to see the light of day again.<br/><br/>
I am having a hard time coming up with positives here.  All I can say is that at least I can stop wondering what will happen within the world of the Matrix (at least in its film incarnations--who knows what else may leak out), but I am undeniably beyond disappointed.<br/><br/>I felt that the pacing was just not quite right--no aspect of the storyline lingered long enough for the audience to get hooked.  And, on top of that, there were some laughably bad scenes where the entire audience laughed out loud. Trust me, there is nothing worse than attempting something dramatic and have it thrown back in your face.  I sincerely hope the filmmakers and their crews write everyone an apology for this garbage.  I must say that I haven't been so angry toward a film before--it could have been so much more. And yet, we are left with one lingering question: will anyone notice that Warner Brothers has taken our money and run?"

","Everything about The Matrix Series was in the second movie. I like The Matrix Revolutions but this is just like a cookie, it is just an end. Second movie fills our brains with lots of questions, with lots of (different) answers (created by ourselves) and therefore I guess we all watch the movie with different (and great) expectations. I think, this movie does not satisfy the audience much (no need to talk about the scene, it was perfect!). But I would like to thank to Wachowski Brothers for such a great series. What else could The Wachowski Brothers do?"

The psuedo-intellectual babble is just intolerable, I wanted to scream and pull my hair out at some of the rbbish that was spouted. Even the Matirx geek sitting next to me was tut-tutting his way through the awful set piece ruminations on life, the universe and everything.<br/><br/> There are some plus points:<br/><br/>1. Hugo Weaving is incredible. The brothers W., in their one inspired directorial moment, obviously told him to recreate his Priscilla character for these films and i think his 'camp-psycho' is the highlight of the film. I loved him in The Matrix, he was the only ray of light in Reloaded, and I just wish he had more screen time in Revolutions. All Hail Hugo!<br/><br/> 2. If one treats the film as a comedy it is amazing. I realised this half-way through and began to laugh at all the psycho-babble and even some of the outrageous gore (SPOILER APPROACHING) - a prime example of this being when Trinity says she cannot go one, 'why?' we all screamed, because rather unfortunately she had been imapled on a few tubes. Great banter! Great stuff! Hilarious! This technique of laughing when perhaps the director did not intend you to allowed me to enjoy SWars:Attack of the Clones. I loved the action, regarding it as an enjoyable matinee style romp, and then treated the love scenes as a satire on American Schmaltzy rubbish.

","The cliffhanger at the end of Reloaded promised much of this film, perhaps too much.<br/><br/>There are three sections to this film - the first third has the usual spiritual guff, the middle section has an ammo count so gratuitous it would make Schwarzeneggar blush, and the film ends with the requisite Kung Fu fight (or should that be flight?). Unfortunately, despite all the dosh they threw at the SFX nobody thought to leave any for the scriptwriters. The dialogue is of such a quality that it makes Star Wars II look like Casablanca, and the ending is sickeningly cheesy. Most of the clever religious references of the first two films are abandoned, leaving an old Jesus retread familiar to any fans of fifties cinema. The film borrows even more heavily from other science fiction, again especially the Neuromancer trilogy. Despite all these flaws I still consider it a fun film - go see it, but don't be upset if you miss the premiere."

I understand that the original woman who played the oracle died, but was that a reason to change the entire storyline? I went into this movie hoping to see all the Matrix come to an end, and in a way it did, but the costs were very dire. First and foremost, the character of Bane (the guy infected with Smith in Reloaded) has very little role in this film, and almost no impact on the storyline like we all thought at the end of Reloaded. Second, we never find out the origins of programs such as the Twins and (more important) we do not see any other agents besides Smith, who has made a complete change from what he was in Part I. Anyway, it was very boring with only the fight sequence against the approaching machines and the battle between Neo and Smith at the very end to keep it afloat. The end sequence just before the credits is unexplainable as well."

","Firstly, let me tell everyone out there that I like some really bad movies. In fact, I just ordered 'The Sweetest Thing' with Cameron Diaz on DVD (admittedly it was well cheap, but that's not the point). However, The Matix Revolutions was not only the worst movie I have ever seen, but a truly dissapointing and thouroghly unsatisfying ending to what was a very entertaining trilogy up until now.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that the first two movies weren't highly problematic and raised far more questions than they answered, but this movie has been billed as the one with the answers, the answer to the Matrix, the answer to if Neo is The One, and it did neither.<br/><br/>Even then, I can cope with mystery, ambiguity, I can use my imagination. I can see what message the Wachowskis are getting at, even though there were no clear answers. However, the one thing I can't deal with is a script written wholly in cliches. There was one point where Jada Pinkett Smith's character does something good (not giving anything away) and Morpheus goes ""You did it"", and my four friends and I chimed in unison ""No, we did it"" as a joke. but sure enough, those were her next words. AHHHHH it was so bad. Even 'The Sweetest Thing' had a more surprising ending than 'The Matrix Revolutions'. I can honestly hand on heart say that it was worse than Vertical Limit and Dreamcatcher put together.  If the movie served one purpose it was to make us think how good 'Love, Actually' looked compared to it. I was tempted to go see Finding Nemo for the third time to relieve my disappointment."

","I simply can't believe that the Matrix was originally planned to have two follow-ups.  Call me a conspiracy-nut, but given what the Wachowskis have done in the sequels (i.e., nothing), it seems so very likely that the sequels were planned only after the original began to pour a river of money into Joel Silver's pocket.  Either that is the case or the Wachowskis are not nearly the gifted filmmakers that ""Bound"" and ""The Matrix"" showed them to be.  Consider that The Matrix told a complete story (Neo flying into the air at the end promised that he was the fabled One, that he would defeat the machines).  Sure it left you with questions, but none that required an answer.  Then comes Reloaded, which dials back Neo's powers (he can no longer rip agents apart from the inside, apparently), unanswers some questions (will Neo defeat the machines?), and adds layer upon layer of needless complexity.  The whole story was told in the first Matrix.  The second two are dross.  As beautiful as they are to behold, they're almost completely content-free.  For fans of special effects, the sequels are must-see movies.  For everyone else, do yourself a favor and consider The Matrix a stand-alone project."

The dialogue, from Morpheus's posturing to Neo's monotone deliveries, is stale. We generally get the sense that we've seen all this before. Making things worse, the movie feels rushed and haphazard. Scenes that seem like they should be better explained and more fleshed out are too short, while others that you can't wait to end go on forever.

Moviegoers need to remember that the first Matrix was fresh and unique, a hard act to follow without seemingly rehashing or repeating certain imagery and themes.<br/><br/>
The race to save Zion from Sentinels and the self discovery by Neo of his destiny are the compelling reasons to watch this film. There are subplots involving a rescue of Neo by Trinity and the final confrontation between Neo and Smith.  There are spectacular battle scenes the likes which may never be duplicated again on this scale for decades to come.  Neo and Smith show how super heroes may battle in future films via astounding effects.  The Oracle figures strongly here courtesy of Mary Alice who does a credible job taking over from the late Gloria Foster.<br/><br/>What are the problems with this film that has critics and fans underwhelmed? The effects do seem to overwhelm at times and there is a feeling that the answers to the burning questions from Reloaded are not sufficiently addressed in more than cryptic fashion.  And, of course, there is a pressing demand for a higher wow factor (or at least a satisfying bookend )which is virtually impossible to meet. Now this is not unheard of-see Star Wars, Back to the Future, and I suspect Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Should you go see this epic? Yes, and it will entertain you.  But do not expect anything more than what it will give you. Allow it to unfold in its own fashion.  The Matrix, while special, was a good film that improved upon repeated viewing via DVD-it is perhaps one of the most successful DVD films in history.  Reloaded is not the dog it has been made out to be once you see the DVD a few times.  I suspect Revolutions may benefit similarly.  But no question the original is still the best.  Now go enjoy."

","I have mixed emotions over the conclusion to this great trillogy.  After seeing Revolutions this morning, I'm aware that it is a very different film from the first two.<br/><br/>For example - there's a huge portion of the plot that has no involvement of either Neo or Trinity (when Zion is being attacked and Niobe & gang are trying to get to the city).  There's like... 40 minutes with no mention or even back-and-forth with Neo & Trinity vs. Niobe & posse.<br/><br/>Also, Trinity dies.  I had a big discussion about this in the car with my boyfriend, and while it's kind of crucial for Trinity to die, it's really f'ing sad.  And the philosophy of the first two movies is sadly missing from most of this third one - only the part at the beginning about love, which was pretty simplistic for the Wachoski brothers.<br/><br/>But, there were also really great points in the movie - it's forever your classic love, war, and action drama.  It has fierce rivalries and climatic moments.  Trinity's death scene is heartfelt and made me tear.  Neo being blinded adds another level of importance to his Sight as the One.  As usual, it's a visual masterpiece.  Trinity getting to see the real sky before dying was kind of cool.<br/><br/>It's missing a bit of bite though, and that's just so disapointing."

","I have just returned from the theatre, after watching the third sequel to the Matrix series. Overall, it was better than the second one (Reloaded). It answers to a lot of questions and I think it ends nice, but of course, you will have to go and watch it yourself. The second movie was maybe the worst of all three, because it was in the middle, there was no end and that left the watcher with a bad taste, thinking the money he/she spent watching some (though excellent) special effects. Nothing special for the effects on the third sequel, they are astonishing, excellent!<br/><br/>Those of you that liked Reloaded, I think you will like Revolutions more. However, because of the long time it took for the Reloaded DVD to be released, I recommend that you watch it first just to clear up some things of the story and then you go to watch Revolutions in case there are some things you don't remember. That's what I did.<br/><br/>Thanks."

","I went to see Matrix Revolutions with great expectations, and was left with a sad feeling of what a good movie it could have been. The Wachowskis missed a huge opportunity to follow through with their past ground breaking word. None of the philosophical infrastructure is here except some empty rhetoric messily and cheesily ending in some christian 'savior' mythology. It's all Hollywood-style 'bing bang boom' and the fight scenes between Smith and Neo are utterly disappointing. This ends up being another Hollywood big budget production flirting with your expectations, and delivering very little. I cannot help but thinking how am I going to now enjoy the previous two movies after this messy disappointment full with cliche dialogues and underdeveloped side characters."

","Revolutions was a let down.  Some of the action scenes were decent, but the dialogue was a real cheese fest except for a couple of good lines by Agent Smith.  On a 1 to 10 scale, the first Matrix was a 9.  The second was a 6. It had some weaknesses, but I had fun watching it.  And the third, well, they went down by three again.  I give Revolutions a 3 out of 10.  What a disappointment when I had such high hopes for the finale."

I do not understand why everyone is saying how disappointing this movie is because if you're a fan of the Matrix or action movies at all than this is nothing short of fantastic.The special effects were jaw-dropping and the climactic final battle is one the most impressive and awe-inspiring action scenes in the entire series. The unrelenting battles keep perfect pace with the brilliant story.The perfect conclusion to the perfect science-fiction saga."

","The third movie in the trilogy, the finale.<br/><br/>The movie had very long scenes, which stretched on and on where they should have been cut to about half their length (someone was apparently sleeping at the editing table). It wasn't just that the scenes were long, they also didn't help propel the plot forward. Some scenes should also have been cut entirely, like the train station scene, or 90% of the zion scenes, as neither did anything for the plot.<br/><br/>When the audience starts laughing at scenes where the director intends tension, relief or the audience to be impressed,  then something is very wrong with the movie.<br/><br/>What bugged me the most was that there was NOTHING new in this movie at all. No new central characters, no revelations or explanations of any kind to any thing or concept revealed in the previous movies.

","Don't worry- I'm no spoiler. Even after this- my most disappointing movie-going experience- I still believe in the sanctity of film.<br/><br/>
I woke up at 7:15 a.m. today, 11/5/03, Revolutions opening day, to experience what I had expected to be the greatest finale of one of the finest film trilogies in cinematic history. Groggy and circle-eyed, I took my fast-food breakfast to my local movie house and waited with a few other hopefuls for an hour and a half for the film to begin. By 11:00 a.m. my expectations of greatness had been ground to paste and flavored with some special effects only to be served back to me in the form of a thick deceitful sludge.<br/><br/>I left the sparsely occupied theatre, hood covering my head, feeling 'had.' What had been built upon a strong and awe-inspiring foundation had been roofed with nothing sturdier then a few blades of grass. What should have been, and what we as movie patrons and congregants of the church of cinema had been lead to believe could have been, turned out to be the cop out of the century shrouded by millions of dollars of special effects and musical scoring<br/><br/>After returning home, my spark of disappointment had only grown into a flame fueled by the fact that in 1999, the original Matrix broke boundaries not only with its ground-smashing special effects, but delivering to its viewers the idea, nay truth, that life and humanity has no borders. They cannot be contained. In this moment, we are able to break outside of our programming and go beyond our dreams- but obviously worshipping at the steps of this false idol's shrine, and making a cinematic messiah out of these films was the fault only of me.<br/><br/>The brothers Wachowski drew us all into this idea and world of possibility. They drew us into a place where reality had nothing to do with what was truly real, but where reality lived in a realm of option and hope that most people are hard-pressed to find. I now know that after this experience, that the truth that they lead us to believe they were aware, had simply been a fluke- a moment of temporary enlightenment.<br/><br/>To Andy and Larry Wachowski: please be careful with knowledge that you think you have an understanding of. Using that assumed-knowledge to give people hope and lift them from their seats only to allow your ignorance to drop them carelessly back to earth is negligent and immoral.<br/><br/>But one does have to have a sense of humor about art and film. After all, we are talking about entertainment here. However, as art imitates life and vice versa, it's still disappointing to find that after having been lead by the hand through the infiniteness of imagination and meta-physical possibility, that the rabbit hole really doesn't go that deep."
"cedric_b1977","8","0","0","5 November 2003"," The End
","Having just seen the movie, I am now trying to concentrate on the whole picture (Matrix, Reloaded, Revolutions). The first thing I can think of is : So much noise for this ? So many philosophical, religious and deep-thinking thoughts and notions to end up in this ? Well I must say I am clearly a little bit disappointed at the end of it. It seems to me as they (The Wachowsky Bros or Silver) have lost the trail of the story they were about to tell us when they made the first Matrix. Revolutions is clearly taking the short way to put an end to this story. The quick and easy way. No answers, but this I don't mind, what bothers is that they don't even give a clue to an answer. What about the Architect for example ? The emphasis on Love seems very sudden. As Revolutions is part B of Reloaded, it is quite amazing that there is just one mention to the word or feeling ""love"" in Reloaded, and that Revolutions looks like a love story. What about lifting the mystery of Machine City (which does by the way, look like a mess, very irregular, a tower there, a building there, compared to the combat or breeding organisation the machine have, where order seems to be the main word !) ? Do we really care ?<br/><br/>Overall, there will be a ""before"" and an ""after"" Matrix trilogy. Visually stunning, amazing, full of wonders the Matrix Series has been a landmark in film history. It is sad that it stays a landmark only for the visuals and the special effects. It could have been a landmark for the storytelling and the philosophical ideas it proposes, but the mixing of all ideas, religions, notions and mythologies kills it. A must see, all of them, while keeping in mind that we have rarely been so close to perfection."

","I saw Revolutions this morning and I must say that it was a good but not great ending to this awesome cyberpunk sci-fi series. I loved both 1 and the infamous sequel Reloaded, since both dealt with particular themes(the first was about self-realization and the second was about the exploration of free will) but Revolutions doesn't provide a closure or even expand on the ideas Reloaded set the stakes up for. I dare compared it to Return Of The Jedi, Revolutions being a more twisted version of it, were it focuses on solving the issues from the film before it guns ablazing rather than examining the ideas and character relationships more firmly. Don't get me wrong, the action sequences were pretty immpresive, but some of the better characters in the series got lost, like Morpheus, Merovingian, or even the Architect, who I thought was going to be a bigger factor in this movie. On the positives, the directors were not afraid to make the Machines and the programs as plain villains, but as beings doing what they must to survive, who can think, feel, and look beyond their status quo, an all too human trait(I recommend people to see the Animatrix, which would justify the machines for their actions, even if I can safely guess that most of you did already). Also, they were willing to kill off major likeable characters, and the ending is interestingly open ended enough to keep us guessing about Neo's fate(note: I think that he becomes sorta of what Lain became at the end of the Japanese anime series Lain, for you kids who saw that particular show). To end, I hope the Warshoskis end this trilogy and pursue other projects, since they strecthed this idea to its max. Other than that, good work, you leather wearing fetish loving brothers, you. 7/10"

","I don't think anyone expected this to be as good as The Matrix, and it wasn't. Having said that, I found myself enjoying the movie significantly throughout. The ending is a bit ""blah"" but seriously, it was IMPOSSIBLE for them to make a satisfying ending for the masses. The Wachowskis made a near impossible situation in the series, so naturally the ending will be a bit hokey. I must say though, I was expecting a worse ending.... far worse. But after just getting out of the movie I realized why I actually like these movies. I was never big into the entire plot of the Matrix series. I was into two things overall: style and mind-blowing effects. These movie delivers both handily, so I left very satisfied. The negative reviews will mostly come from Matrix purists and enthusiasts who know the entire story inside and out. I can sympathize with them; I can imagine that if I were deeply intwined in the matrix as they are, I wouldn't be thrilled about this movie. It clearly strays from The Matrix, as did Reloaded. It's hard to say exactly what is different, but Reloaded and Revolutions are just different kinds of movies. To me, The Matrix was a near perfect movie from beginning to end: truly captivating all the way through. Reloaded and Revolutions, however, had me rolling my eyes at several points in each. Nevertheless, Revolutions delivered for me... it entertained me, showed me what I like to see in movies...... just don't go in expecting a fantastic conclusion to one of the greatest movie series ever. 8/10"

All unanswered questions from Matrix Reloaded are answered.

I will not spoil the surprise for anyone who hasn't seen it yet so don't worry about bumping in to spoilers. I had my own theories on the way that the story could go but I was pretty much wrong on all counts as the film has a few surprises in store. Add to that Sarif, whose background you are let in on, and the Battle of Zion it made the whole experience well worth the wait! One last note, I am pleased to report that there is little use of CGI that spoiled the neo vs. agent smith fight in Reloaded.

To find out what i mean, i suggest you run towards your local movie theatre, and spend the best few bucks you will ever spend.<br/><br/>The Wachowski brothers also did a fine job on settling all the loose ends Reloaded left open, without giving too much information. I don't think there could have been a better middle path between an easy ride, and a 'free-for-interpretation' storyline.<br/><br/>A small point of criticism, it was said that Reloaded & Revolutions together form a singular event, being the end of the war, in a time span of only 72 hours. Logically the viewer should be trown into the story in Revolutions, since it is basically the middle of the story, but instead the story, like in reloaded, develops a little too slow to my liking.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the CGI will absolutely blow you off your seat, and I am convinced it will inspire countless directors in the near future, who will hopefully equalise this piece of art.<br/><br/>Conclusion: This was genius... 9/10"

Instead Trinity just says: ""Enough with this shit"" or something like that and point a gun to his head, and gives him the choice between life or death... I think that was a bit to quick. Anyways, at other points with the end especially, I was very satisfied, It didn't get to happy and I hadn't predicted it.

Not one new idea or character has been introduced since the original film. The ideas in Revolutions (and Reloaded) are all plagiarised from The Matrix and the new characters are one dimensional and awful. There's no continuity in any of the films (characters and plot-lines come and go) and the interesting philosophical questions in the first film become ridiculous in the second and third movies.<br/><br/>The best I can say for Revolutions is that it's better than Reloaded.

There is no question, that this can't be disappointing. So what is? I'll tell you what is:<br/><br/>Nothing.

As a Matrix fan, I enjoyed Revolutions thoroughly. It continued more or less right where Reloaded left off. Yet, from the excitment that was seen in Reloaded, Revolutions dissapoints.<br/><br/>The majority takes place within the Real World, with 3 story's branching off. First, Zion is waiting for the Sentinels to attack, the Hammer is trying to make it back to Zion, and the Logos, carrying Neo and Trinity, is trying to make it to the machine city.<br/><br/>Although not nearly filled with philosophical mumbo jumbo and difficult words such as ""ergo"", the film dissapointed me with much of the same lines being repeated. Scenes that looked to be hot in the trailers (such as the Hell Club) were not.<br/><br/>Another negative is the acting by Ian Bliss, as Bane/Human Smith. While we, as the audience, know that he is Smith, Bliss does not deliver the drama and power of Hugo Weaving. He sounds like he has a cold more rather than a pyscho path.<br/><br/>However, the negatives get outbalanced by a superior performance by Hugo Weaving as Smith, who is spreading like a California wildfire through the Matrix. We see him go from a cold machine, to a psychotic emotional madman in this conclusion.<br/><br/>Also among the postives is the final clash between Neo and Smith. This was intresting in that *SPOILER* we don't see 5 jillon Smiths trying to take on Neo. It's Neo and Smith One on One. Neo comes out as the ""Good One"" while Smith is, ""Bad One"".<br/><br/>And with the credits rolling, no Rage Against The Machine, no Marilyn Manson, just Don Davis' score playing.<br/><br/>While a dissapointment, it was still, in my opinion, an outstanding film, showing that it doesn't have to be in the Matrix to be exciting."

The ambiguity the first film left you with was not replicated in the slightest as instead of pondering over questions like, ""hmm..i wonder what neo's going to do now?"" you are instead shown in a somewhat disappointing 'hollywood action' way.<br/><br/>The third film indeed is an improvement on the second but still is a far shot from the greatness of the first movie. It has a poor and predictable ending and the final fightscene is a terrible let-down. I thought the final battle scene would either be a high paced kung fu fight as seen in the first movie, or an all out battle using new and unseen powers. Instead it was a poor mix of both...sigh.. The film also contains many unnecessary scenes that just humour what should be serious and suspenseful part of the movie (e.g. the Trinity bit and Agent Smith's face....why?)<br/><br/>However. There are some incredible sequences in The Matrix Revolutions that relinquish any doubt i had in the capability of CG animation. The action sequence between the sentinals and Zion's defences is truly the most amazing action scene i have ever seen. Infact the entire invasion of Zion is a truly outstanding piece of action.<br/><br/>However, the CG animation and action sequence do not resurrect this film from poor directing and a plot that detaches from the original more and more as the minutes pass by. Many of the excellent and mysterious characters are barely involved or just missed out entirely such as the Merovingian and the superb Virus Twins. Monica Belluci however returns and more is exposed of her 'character'...you will understand when you see it.<br/><br/>

","With The Matrix series of films, the Wachowski's wanted to honour, and bring to life all their favourite anime moments, and place them into a 'real-life' film.  The Matrix blew people away with its cutting edge 'bullet-time' effects, and fast paced story.  Then came Reloaded (eventually), and the audience were divided.  Whereas the first film was easy to pick up and watch simply for the action, Reloaded delved further into the philosophies and religious aspects/parallels, baffling many who just wanted to see some kick-ass action.  With Revolutions, there is going to be a further divide, and out of all the people who loved the first film, only around 1/3 will really appreciate this final chapter in the series.<br/><br/>It is hard to review this film without giving away spoilers, so I won't go into the plot.  I will only state that if you haven't seen the first two films, then don't see this film until you have.  The film picks up from where Reloaded left off, and doesn't waste time explaining previous events. Those who have seen the other two films will be ready for the events of this film.<br/><br/>This third film is the most anime of the three, with story themes similar to many of the better animes to have come out of Japan, and also with action so frantic, and filled with detail, that it can, at times, be hard to follow for the general cinema-goer.  The religious aspects of the second film are built upon more, and the battles are similar to the kind of battles you would see on Toonami, with mecha-style attacks, and more martial arts, this time with 'super-powers'.  It is the fact that the film has really become so anime-ish that a lot of people will be disgruntled, and will bemoan that it is a let-down.<br/><br/>From this review so far, you probably get the impression that I wasn't too happy with the film.  You couldn't be more wrong.  I thoroughly enjoyed every last minute of it, following the story, getting to the core of the various philosophies being toyed with, and the action was stunning.  The effects have improved dramatically since the last film, which at times suffered from obvious CGI.  This time the CGI is improved upon, and the key fights are really well realised.  The fast pacing of the fights, and so much going on at once captures the feel of confusion that a major battle will cause in real life.<br/><br/>Anyone expecting all those questions that were raised in Reloaded can rest assured that they are, but then again, they aren't!  Confused?  Well, thankfully the film doesn't pander to the 'popcorn-crowd' and explain everything in patronisingly simple terms.  No, instead the Wachowskis give more questions, and leave a lot to your own interpretation.  I followed it, I grasped the meanings, much in the way that I fully understood Donnie Darko.  It's just that you may interpret it differently.  Which interpretation is right?  Only the Wachowski's know, and they ain't telling (at least not yet.)<br/><br/>As stated above, like Reloaded this will divide audiences.  I'm in the YAY crowd here, and will be seeing it again.  The best thing about films like this is they spark debate, they generate discussion, and they get you thinking.  Just because it is an action film doesn't mean it has to be Jurassic Park!  As Morpheus once said, `No one can tell you what the Matrix is, you have to find out for yourself!'.  Watch it, and make your own mind up on what it is all about."

","The Matrix fans hoping that ""Revolutions"" would satisfyingly conclude the trilogy are most likely going to be disappointed. We are served the same dish of pseudo-intellectual nonsense as in the predecessor, with a healthy amount of wire-action kung fu (well done, but tasted too many times before in 2003) as the main, meaty course.<br/><br/>The CGI is quite a bit more believable than for example the video game-like ""fight against the 100 Smiths"" in ""Reloaded"", but to yours truly all the explosions and giddy camera rushes became a bit tiresome in the long run, although impressive.<br/><br/>When the Wachowski bros want to show human emotion, my shoes were on the brink of ripping apart, so hard was I bending my toes. I guess the audience was supposed to be moved during one of the final - and among other overlong - scenes (spaceship, Neo and Trinity spill their bitter tears). Me, I sighed, even though usually, it's not very hard to make my eyes water in the theatre. Phoney, phoney, phoney.<br/><br/>The end did not exclude the possibility of a Matrix IV (or even V and VI - I wouldn't be surprised); that money could be better spent. All in all: the first Matrix was a smash hit, and deservedly so. The next two movies should be ignored by all other than die hard sci-fi fans. And you sci-fi freaks out there, you're gonna go see it, anyway, of course - just as I would've done, even if I read my own review beforehand.<br/><br/>Mark: 5.5 of 10, because the reviewer is a fan of the genre."

","Why, because LOTR maybe better but it is still an adaptation and it is not SiFi. My only critique at the Wachowskis is that they used there Anime influences wrongly. They could have made better use of it in there dialogue and storyline. People will surely thrash `Revolutions' because it's is easer to be negative and condescending in the hope to sound ""intelligent"" than to appreciate the effort. For us true SiFi fans is has been a long drought since the first instalment of Star Wars (the second instalment is still a `wait and see'), the genre was considered dead. `Lost in Space' and `Star Trek' (the one about the Borgs not the last one) were just a drop in the bucket and most of all .those weren't trilogies.<br/><br/>So, why I loved Revolutions? Simply because it got my juices flowing. The actions sequences were decent with a one special note for the `Zion breach' sequence (A+ action).  The story got me guessing nicely and I got my in trance for the whole 129 min with one exception where I went like `just shut-up and die'. If you've seen it you'll know what I'm talking about. It was to long and boring. The special effects weren't as spectacular as part 1 but they did some pretty good CGI and camera work with the sentinels. The Agent Smith-Neo final fight had some glitches and I favour the Reloaded version.<br/><br/>Last but not least I enjoy, savour and value this SiFi trilogy because there will not nor has there been a (good) alternative for a long, long time.

","The first Matrix is one of my favorite movies of all times, and although I don't hold Reloaded in such high reverence, I still enjoyed it. Despite the fact that Reloaded left many loose ends plotwise, I was excited to see them be addressed in Revolutions.  Unfortunately, they were not addressed, and I was very disappointed with an extremely mediocre ending to such a promising trilogy. The movie begins in a promising fashion, and throughout the film many enjoyable action sequences take place, with great special effects, and a great deal of suspence ensues.  However, the final resolution of the film, and thus the entire trilogy, does not resolve much of anything. Furthermore, many characters from Reloaded returned, but in minor roles, and the resolution of these characters was nonexistent. Thus overall, this movie has some impressive actions sequences and visual effects, but the hardcore Matrix fan such as myself who goes into the movie looking for an original conclusion to an original and ambitious trilogy is bound to be disappointed."
"sloopydrew","4","0","0","5 November 2003"," Revolutions turns into your standard Hollywood action movie - big on explosions, small on brains.
","Andy and Larry Wachowski have written and directed themselves into a hole. The original Matrix was an intelligent and refreshing science-fiction film. The Matrix Reloaded was a rehash that pretended to be intelligent by spewing out a bunch of fortune cookie philosophies and a series of unanswerable questions meant to keep the diehards believing that this moneymaking venture was leading to something meaningful.  The Matrix Revolutions drops all pretenses and turns into your standard Hollywood action movie - big on explosions, small on brains.<br/><br/>An advantage Revolutions has over Reloaded is with its characters. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), in particular.  For some unknown reason, Morpheus became this sort of Jesse Jackson meets Yoda type character in the second film.  He was boring and pretentious.  It looked as though his face would crack if he even attempted to smile.  In the third film, with his faith in The One shaken, he's a far more human character.  By the end, he becomes almost likable.  At the same time, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has become even more egocentric and out of control.  He makes for a wonderful bad guy, and Weaving does an excellent job of upping-the-ante in the third film, to give the audience the feeling that Smith is a real threat that needs to be stomped out, at all costs.  His performance adds a level of tension to the film that it almost doesn't deserve.  It also makes the final confrontation between Smith and Neo, this one labeled the ""Super Burly Brawl,"" far more exciting than the Burly Brawl in Reloaded.  Sadly, it can't save the battle between Christ (Neo) and the Anti-Christ (Agent Smith) from an unsatisfying ending.<br/><br/>The ability to avoid looking for the answers is the only way you'll be able to enjoy this film.  If you turn your brain off for The Matrix Revolutions in the same way you would for Charlie's Angels:  Full Throttle, you'll have an okay time.  But the Matrix trilogy was supposed to be the exception to the big-budget rule.  Instead of turning your mind off, these movies were meant to make you think.  If the questions asked in Reloaded were actually answered in Revolutions, this could have been an incredible film.  Sadly, newsgroup predictions of what would happen in The Matrix Reloaded, typed out by hardcore fans of the series, have been more interesting than what the Wachowski brothers eventually came up with."

"CareySandwich","4","0","0","4 November 2003"," Why it doesn't work
","The third installment of the vastly popular Matrix series is a grand disappointment on all fronts. Where we were hoping it was going to be a combination of the first Matrix and the better half of the second, it ended up taking the worse half of the second and extrapolating an entire movie. Sorry, folks. Remember how one of the biggest problems with 2 was that it didn't give you enough to work with in 3's absence?  Well not only is Revolutions completely unfulfilling intellectually, but it also lacks the interesting characters and impressive scenes that Reloaded had to make up for things like annoying dialogue. And if I had to pick one place to start when tearing Revolutions to shreds, it would have to be the annoying dialogue. The lines in this film had such an immense clichÃ© feel that at times I felt like I was watching a sci-fi James Bond for third graders. And it's no surprise because the movie focused entirely on the most annoying characters: the humans.<br/><br/>Just about the entire thing takes place in Zion, where the humans are trying not to get destroyed by machines. Whatever. It's extremely difficult to care about things like the possible extinction of the human race in a movie series where the interesting, likeable characters are all actually computer programs.  Perhaps that's what the Wachowski brothers were trying to get at: humans are flawed and lame, computers are gnarly and perfect.  There were hints of that theme in the film, but over-all I think this is a case of the directors not knowing what it was about The Matrix that people liked so much. Let me fill them in: it was the matrix. It was the world where nothing is as it seems, and you can prance around with superior control over the properties of physics. It was not a dank ship where cheesy catchphrases moved the plot. In the matrix, your enemies are extremely intelligent and intriguing agents, not annoying robot octopi. In the matrix there are discussions of philosophy, religion, politics and cookies. In the real world all you have is your same old good vs. evil bit going on. It's nothing new and it's nothing interesting. The only thing that can make it interesting is that sometimes you have to go into the matrix for some answers. But when too much of your movie resolves itself without any time in the matrix, as Revolutions most definitely does, what you have left is big old 'when will this be over'-fest. As far as the `did Revolutions answer the questions posed in Reloaded?' query goes, the answer is- not really. All you have in Revolutions is a bunch of unglued philosophical and religious references. On top of that, the story is unclear. There were too many points in the movie that make you go, `what exactly just happened?' And for those of you who are hoping for a super profound ending to this tale, I hate to disappoint you. The ending was awful. Even if it had made sense there would have been far better ways to end it. There are so many bad things to say about this movie that I don't have nearly enough time or space to focus on specifics, and I CERTAINLY don't have time to focus on the only good thing Revolutions had which is the continued brilliance of Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. And frankly, by the time the long-awaited Neo-Smith showdown occurs, the movie is so far past the point of possible redemption that it's almost impossible to enjoy. It's not at all Weaving's fault that the long-previewed showdown does little-to-nothing to save the film, since he more than does his part. His Agent Smith goes down in my book as the best movie villain since Darth Vader. Which is a fitting, considering the fact that the third matrix plays out a lot like the third Star Wars (or sixth. I can never keep it straight). The exhausting battle scenes that switch back and forth from sentinels vs. ship to sentinels vs. Zion aren't even all that fun to watch. That which worked for Return of the Jedi roughly thirty years ago does not work for The Matrix. That which does work for the Matrix-fights and story within the matrix-is stuffed back to the point where you want to just make the Wachowski brothers take it home and do it again. It's unfortunate that this film turned out the way it did because I suspect it is going to cost The Matrix franchise a lot of fans."
"HIBBY","6","0","0","5 November 2003"," Everything that has a great beginning does not end well!
","*May contain spoilers*<br/><br/>I went into the theatre hoping to see a great conclusion to the Matrix Trilogy. While I wasn't totally disappointed, I also wasn't very pleased. The film starts out great with good dialogue and excellent action scenes. The Club Hell sequence is dynamite. Trinity is back to being the tough no nonsense girl I loved in The Matrix. I sort of hoped the intensity and action would pick up from there. Instead, it's all downhill from there, straight into a straight laced action flick, but without the heart and soul that made the first movie a classic.<br/><br/>Good Points: 1. Hugo Weaving is over the top. His Agent Smith rivals any movie villain. Kudos to a terrific performance. 2. Carrie Ann Moss was back to being tough and in charge. Trinity was on fire in Club Hell. I was also surprised at how much emotion I felt for her when she stepped off the train. Very convincing. Kudos again. I hate the WB bros for what they did to her in the end. Curses on them! 3. Ian Bliss was great as Bane, very evil. I imagined Hugo helped with his character, because he was just as menacing as Smith and I clapped when he got what he deserved. 4. Mary Alice was a good choice to replace Gloria Foster. 5. The Oracle smoking. I loved it. To hell with being P.C. in the movies.<br/><br/>Bad Points: 1. The Rama-Kandra/Sati story line made no sense and makes no contribution to the story as a whole. The movie never really answers why she is important or maybe I just missed it. 2. Morpheus, the leader of the rebellion? Not in the movie! Here he is a small, weak, pathetic, minor character, totally dominated by Niobe. 3. The soundtrack was poor and lacked the intensity of M1 and 2. In fact it lacked all intensity, especially in the Club Hell shoot-out. What were they thinking? They could have a made a good scene fantastic with better music. Think the Lobby shoot-out in M1 played to the music of Barry Manilow. Sorry! 4. The mystery and surprise is gone. In fact, if you have seen the trailer, you have seen the movie. 5. The ending (from the end of the Neo/Smith showdown to the credits), about fifteen minute, is the worst ending to any recent movie I have seen. It is ambiguous, non-conclusive, and anti-climatic and made little sense. It also makes what Neo said on the phone at the end of the first movie pointless. There can be no peace without victory. A truce is just a cease-fire, not a resolution."

"Booyahjeff","6","0","0","6 November 2003"," Does not Disappoint
","Basically, this movie is better than `Reloaded', but certainly not better than the original `Matrix' or '96.  When I think back to `the Matrix', I remember that at the end of the movie, I could make my own conclusions as to whether or not Neo saves people of the Matrix and the real world.  If he does save the world, I could also imagine my own scenario of Neo saving everyone.  With `Revolutions', all that is taken away from me. <br/><br/>
With that said, I think that maybe a downer ending would've suited this franchise much better.  But hey, I'm just an idiot who's writing down thoughts about the movie.  I didn't make em.  A happier ending may appeal to some (perhaps wider) audiences, and I'm fine with that.  The ending to `Revolutions' isn't what I thought it would be, but it certainly is not a let down.<br/><br/>Whereas `Reloaded' felt rather redundant; as the audience was almost 100% sure that Neo would live to see another movie, `Revolutions' makes the audience fear for him, especially since most of the time in the movie, he is in the real world.  He has special powers, but he is also human. <br/><br/>
The battle scenes inside Zion's walls obviously look a tad on the virtual side.  But come on now, we're talking about a bunch of flying machines invading an underground city, protected by giant machine-gun capable robots, controlled by humans.  Do you have the stock footage of this in your vault? I didn't think so.  <br/><br/>I thought these scenes were very thrilling because I'm usually the one that really puts myself into the shoes of the characters on screen.  When the machines breach the wall, I hope to God that they are stopped.  I couldn't imagine what it would be like to lose a battle like that.<br/><br/>There are other chill scenes besides the one I just described, but I don't think any one raised the hair on the back of my neck than when Trinity and Neo fly above the dark skies of the real world, and finally see the sky the way it was meant to be seen.  I can't really describe it well enough; it was just a great moment as far as this story goes.<br/><br/>Thankfully, in this movie, there isn't much in the line of monotonous line reading by the architect.  For the average movie going herb chuck, that was a monumental detraction of `Reloaded'.  <br/><br/>I don't care if there is a message hidden beneath all the blabbing of the Architect, the greatest movies work on both the entertaining and intellectual levels.<br/><br/>But, while also getting back to my original problem with this movie, there was almost no sign of an original, intelligent idea in this movie.  Sure, there are moments that will make audiences go `Huh'?  But they're easily figured out when thought about for a second.  <br/><br/>I am no way endorsing, deep, thought-provoking, intellectual, philosophical dreck that usually occupies the `Best Picture' category, I'm just saying that all action isn't that great outside of a Sly Stallone flic (No, not Over the Top').  <br/><br/>Overall, I think the only thing I can say about this movie is that it was ok.  I don't think it was a landmark feature like `The Matrix', not by a long shot.  This movie was just a detailed description of how Neo does in fact save the real world.  To some, it will be a let down, others it'll be a little exciting.  For even others, it will be a little of both.  But what `The Matrix: Revolutions' will not be, is as great as the first movie in the series was."

","so many questions.  i went into this movie hoping for the best as one of the people that didn't hate the second, but it truly left me with a seriously bad taste in my mouth.  first, the one sucks.  i truly hated the fact that the only purpose he had was to bring a short lived peace between man and machine.  if agent smith would have taken over neo's body and smith as a virus destroyed all machines in the real world, i would have been much happier, but that didn't happen.  instead, neo dies and the world is left with man and machines living together. how long is that going to last. second, that kind of sucks for neo since his purpose was to save mankind in the real world when im sure he never followed the white rabbit in the first place with the thought of dying, he wouldn't even walk on the building ledge in the first movie.  so what if he was unhappy in his job, i still think he would have been better off in the matrix.   no, he wouldn't have loved trinity, but they would have never met, so what would he have to lose. maybe it's just me.  i also personally believe that everyone would have been better off inside the matrix because you led a better life.  i mean consider it, if you had the choice right now, would you want to leave.  zion doesn't really seem like the place to be.  hey, maybe it's just me.  im just disappointed that the conclusion is that there might be a peace for a little while between man and machine.  i am complaining alot, but the funny thing is, i actually enjoyed the movie.  i hated the end, but loved the battle between man controlled machines and machines themselves.  i was always hoping to see the war in the terminator movies between man and machine, so im happy that they showed this.  i have to commend the wachowski's that though each movie was apart of a trilogy, that each movie was uniquely different in its own way, and each was enjoyable.  but the problem is that they were part of a trilogy, and its just didn't come together with any sort of satisfaction.  also, the fight scenes are pretty much non existent involving hand to hand combat, and when people or programs do fight, it's really not that entertaining.  but i do reccomend watching it if you enjoy special effects and long, entertaining  battles, but  be forewarned, you probably wont enjoy how it comes together, for your own reasons.  maybe its just me."

","It's next to impossible to improve upon the first Matrix film, so I won't pretend that Reloaded or Revolutions does so. Both movies do a great job expanding and resolving the Matrix universe, though, and I'm glad for the whole package.<br/><br/>Revolutions concludes a trilogy of great action movies made for intelligent people. It asks you to think, to question, to try and understand the world and our place in it. It also dazzles with furious action and emotion. I love the franchise for this superb blend of adrenaline and reflection.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, the Matrix trilogy will stand with The Lord of the Rings as the best film series' ever made.

","Revolutions takes off where reloaded left you. This third installment is quite different than the other two. Most of the movie takes place in the real world and Neo really only has one fight the whole movie. This movie wasn't dealing with all the philosophy that the second did, but focuses more on purpose. What was Neo's purpose and what is everyone's purpose. There is an insane battle against the machines that takes place with fairly good special effects. This movie also deals with feelings and if the machines had any real emotion or not. Biblically this movie shows Neo as a modern day Jesus, give or take a bit. Smith has become more powerfull yet again and it makes for  a good end battle. Although the begining is fairly action packed the movie tones down for awhile until the climax.

In about 10 occasions in the movie, you nearly hear a background voice saying: ""listen well, the Wachowski brothers are gonna tell you a great truth of life""...<br/><br/>I gotta say that special effects are incredible while the set design suffers from the same pretentious flaws as the scenario. Two questions for the people in charge of the visual design of the movie: 1) what the hell is wrong with EVERY surface in this world? Every surface is covered with grime, rust and dust... Furthermore, how come people wear white clothes in a world where everything is dirty and yet, they manage to stay clean?? 2) If a society can manufacture sophiticated robots and computers, why is it that everybody wears sweaters that are falling apart?  <br/><br/>In summary, this movie would have been way better if the producers would have done their jobs and reminded the directors of what made the success of the first movie. The world has enough of one pope, having two more is definitely an excess."

","The Matrix: Revolutions was a spectacular ending to a very entertaining trilogy. We knew from the beginning, or should have, that this was not a story that could end completely. Fortunately, this was not the history of a world. This was not a story about a world torn by a war between machine and man. This was a story about Neo. Many will feel that too much is left unsaid or undone by the end of Revolutions, but they must remember that this trilogy is not about the world, it is about Neo - his personal story. A great deal of this film takes place in Zion. As should be generally known, the machines mount an immense assault on Zion. The special effects were very convincing and the battle was intense. In spite of all of these elements, matters do not dissolve into mindless action. Instead, it progresses the path of the One. All elements in the film - the action, the long speeches, the love and the pain - are just to guide the One to the end of his path. It must be remembered that this trilogy is his tale. Once we remember that, we will see that this story was the essence of what we've come to desire from films. We want to see the human struggle. We want to see weakness, denial, tribulation, love, acceptance and sacrifice. This delivers it all. It is the most human tale. Many will hate this film. I loved it. I was deeply moved and I was satisfied to not take one step beyond the path of the One. It was enough."

","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>Upon leaving the theater after watching the culmination of the 'Matrix' trilogy, I was wondering only one thing: why was this story three movies long?  The fatal flaw of 'Revolutions' is that it renders 'Reloaded' completely irrelevant.  In fact, I daresay you wouldn't even need to see 'Reloaded' to understand 'Revolutions.'  This series would have been much better served to take the best ideas from both films and trimmed them down into one.<br/><br/>Now that I can reflect on the trilogy as a whole, I can almost picture how the sequels came into being.  The Wachowskis sat down and said to each other ""Now where can we take this story?""  (I will never believe they originally planned it as a trilogy from the beginning).  They rattled off a deluge of ideas, but instead of paring them down into a coherent narrative, they crammed EVERY concept they had into 'Reloaded' and then when it came time to resolve everything in 'Revolutions,' they just came up with a few interminably overlong action sequences and resolved the two main conflicts (Zion vs. The Machines and Neo vs. Smith).<br/><br/>Everything else in 'Reloaded' is all but ignored.  Didn't understand the Architect's monologue?  Guess what, you don't need to.  It's not ever mentioned here.  Want some of those conflicting philosophies on the nature of reality clarified?  Don't hold your breath.  Want to know about Merovingian's role in the grand scheme of the Matrix?  You won't find out (his appearance here is little more than a cameo).  The Twins, the Keymaker, the relationship triangle between Morpheus and Niobe and the general....all of it ignored.  In fact, Morpheus has such a trivial role in this final chapter that it's pathetic.  He doesn't guide Neo, he doesn't fight anyone, he doesn't even give lame speeches at Zion raves.  He's just there to get yelled at by Niobe and watch others die in the defense of Zion.<br/><br/>If only the Wachowskis had just streamlined all their ideas into one coherent film, maybe they would have given us something to stand the test of time.  Something to put alongside 'Star Wars' and 'The Lord of the Rings.' But instead they opted to pummel us with a 2 1/2 hour philosophy lecture with 'Reloaded' (albeit with a few stellar action sequences) and a generic resolution that offers no answers with 'Revolutions' (which has redundant, familiar action sequences recycled from the first two films).  This trilogy cannot be whispered in the same breath as those classic fantasy epics.<br/><br/>So should I care?  Should I try to decipher all their vague intentions in making these films?  Should I attempt to make sense of it all?<br/><br/>I choose not to.<br/><br/>The Matrix - 9/10 The Matrix Reloaded - 7/10 The Matrix Revolutions - 5/10"

We were engaged in a turning or tuning of the rules between those who govern, and the governed. A throwing off of an unwanted outside control in favor of self determination, not a simple rebellion. So too do these movies explore (albeit lightly) the nature of control, the meaning of reality, and the purpose of existence, within an action setting.

","Let me explain Matrix 3 by going through the other 2 movies.  There will be spoilers.<br/><br/>THE MATRIX:  This film benefited greatly from the unknown.  At the time of it's release in 1999 no one knew what the Matrix was only that it had cool looking special effects based on the trailers.  What viewers found was a thinking mans movie not just action.  This was a complex movie that left the viewer contemplating the story line well after they had last seen the movie. At the time of the films release the viewer was not sure if there would be any sequels and had to fill in the open ending based on their own beliefs and understanding of the Matrix.  It was a perfect blending of story, action and special effects.<br/><br/>THE MATRIX-RELOADED:  Perhaps the most most anticipated sequel since STAR WARS-THE PHANTOM MENACE.  After 4 years of waiting viewers finally were able to  satisfy their hunger.  This film release in spring 2003 suffered from special effects fatigue.  Where as the first film won oscars and set new standards in the FX industry this movie felt it had to top those effects.  I personally feel the new effects such as the brawl scene were not up to par and had a video game look to them.  However, the effects were for the most part good.  When I first saw the film I was a little disappointed.  I felt the film was bogged down in complicated conversations with little character development for the new characters.  However, during the following months I realized the various conversations between characters were the real strength of the movie.  I had great fun in monitoring the message boards as fans tried to figure out part 3.  <br/><br/>THE MATRIX-REVOLUTIONS:  Released in fall 2003 it finished of the story but not at all in a satisfactory manner.  The special effects were the best I've seen this year and probably should win an Oscar.  However, the story line took a beating.  The fight in Zion was good and the watching Niobe pilot the remaining ship back to Zion was good viewing.  I felt that the ending for Neo was predictable but well done.  What I thought was in bad taste was unspecified future of the Matrix and the Zion inhabitants.  It appears that the Machines will free the humans they have in pods.  That's how I interpreted the closing conversation between the Oracle and the Architect. It was a cryptic conversation that left a lot to interpretation.  It appears that new Matrix after the reload has new enhancements.  A blue sky for one. The green sky that marked the Matrix is now replaced with a more real lighting and colors.  However, the Brothers should have had a conversation between the Oracle and perhaps Morpheus that spelled out exactly what the future would hold for man and machine.  This was not spelled out.  Instead a 16 year old kid runs around telling everyone the war is over and everyone believes him.  For all the Kid knew it could have been a temporary cease fire.  This ending had too many unanswered questions.<br/><br/>Lastly, this is still a great trilogy.  I don't think the Brothers could ever have written sequels that lived up to the original.  The original was just that, ORIGINAL!!!  No precedents had been set or pre-conceived notions of what to expect were in place.  The sequels cold never be as original as the first.  I will add viewing the ANI-MATIRX and completing ENTER THE MATRIX adds in quite a bit of back story that will add depth to the story."

","The third chapter of the Matrix series fails to build on the premise of the first two movies.  In ""The Matrix"" we got a world where reality is not reality.; there is another level of reality outside of the Matrix where people live.  In ""Reloaded"" we got yet another level of reality thrown at us, in that Neo and ""the One"" have come before.  Zion has been built and destroyed many times before.  The Architect and the Oracle are two powerful forces battling a war of armies and ideologies.  The stage is now set for ""Revolutions"" which takes us... nowhere.  Nothing new is revealed, and what little is revealed is vague.  Sometimes vague is good, but not here.  We get lots of impressive visual action, but it's all kind of predictable and doesn't amount to much.  We also get lots of attention paid to minor characters who only mean anything if you played the Matrix video games. Neo, Trinity and especially Morpheus are lost in the background.  None of them get a satisfying ending or final scene.  We don't get any real questions answered, but we do get lots of new questions to ask.

","I don't normally do this, but I was so disappointed in this movie that I had to. With Reloaded, I read the reviews, and they were mostly negative, but that wasn't<br/><br/>going to stop me from seein this movie. I went and thought it was awesome,<br/><br/>action-packed, and what a second movie in a trilogy should be, action, lots of plots and characters, and successfully set up the third movie.  So reviews that were actually luke-warm wasn't going to stop me from seein Revolutions. I<br/><br/>couldn't wait as a matter of fact. The movie started off a lot better than I expected. I was liking it a lot. Then the Zion war started, granted it was a big deal, but too much time was spent fighting the squiddies. There wasn't enough dialogue to<br/><br/>fulfill all of the questions that were left by the first two installments. Many of the great characters from the second movie were left with no closure or anything, time was used up on the Zion war. As for the ending, don't worry there aren't any spoilers, but could it be more obvious? I mean I thought of this ending after Reloaded but figured that it was too simple to be used, but there it was in front of my face. And as for the subtle hints that were thrown in at the end as to what Neo was supposed to be were so obvious. They tired to make the movie deep<br/><br/>and philosophical as the first one and even the second one, but it ended up with a simple, obvious, very un Matrix-like ending. For a trilogy that reinvented so many ideas mentally and physically on screen, to end with the most obvious<br/><br/>and easy ending seemed wrong and it was. Sorry I have to spoil it right here: The last thing I wanted was Neo to be like Christ and sacrifice himself for<br/><br/>everyone, but there he was sprawled out like he was on a crucifix (ala Cool<br/><br/>Hand Luke), seeing ""the light"", ""saving"" the people of Zion by giving up his life, and even a freakin GLOWING CROSS coming out from him at one point. It was<br/><br/>just too much and too ridiculous for me to handle. Give me Trinity, Morpheus, Neo, and a cast of others strolling down a street in the real world that has been saved and rid of the Matrix and I'm happy. I know that sounds trite, but for me this whole Christ thing was THE most obvious possible ending. Such a shame,<br/><br/>I'm a heartbroken Matrix fan. I still love the first two, and I will view the 3rd many more times as well as own it, but it just didn't figure itself out the way it should have."

","Matrix Reloaded left plenty of open possibilities for the third part. Monica Bellucci character or the Twins, plus the long discourse of the Architect.  Well not much of these are in the third part.  Monica has one scene, the Twins are nowhere to be seen and the Architect; well things are not exactly as he said.<br/><br/>Is Matrix Revolution a good or a bad movie ?. In action terms, combat in ZION is a spectacular FX long sequence; but the lack of humans in it, reduces the emotion. The dead of one of the main characters with no FX, is too long and not particularly emotive so people started to laugh and whistle. The end of the movie it is so open that I do not think anybody will be satisfied, plus is far from happy.<br/><br/>Matrix is a comic; with all the darkness we are used on them. The end of the movie (and of the trilogy) is as dark as you might expect from a comic (were you have to wait for the next issue). However, even if the end could (and for sure will) disappoint you like it did to me; I feel that it was the proper and logical ending.<br/><br/>I came to understand, that Matrix was never intended as the blockbuster it became. The optimistic beginning has nothing to do with the outcome of the rest; it was as the Architect pointed, just an illusion.<br/><br/>However, I believe there were a lot more on this movie than we see in the screen.  I wont be surprised if  many story lines were left in the cutting room to keep the movie within the two hours commercial duration. I only wish the Wachosky release the `Directors Cut' someday.  In the meantime, if you saw the second, do not loose the third, but if you did not see the second, please do not go and keep the first one with your good memories."

The storyline (machines vs. mankind, etc...) that was interesting in the original because we only saw the edge of it all, has been stretched out to a ridiculous limit like string cheese, and rendered sloppy and meaningless. The further you go with this plot, the sillier it gets.<br/><br/>Nothing has changed from the last film. There's Neo, there's Morpheus, there's Trinity, there's a bunch of dirty extras, there's the slow motion, there's a bunch of Agent Smiths, there's that same music. What's missing is any sense of interest in the story. The makers obviously just like to toy with our heads, which is evident in dialogue like (""Who is he?""/""He is you."" or ""What do you want?""/""I want what you want""). That's about as ""deep"" as it gets.<br/><br/>Naturally, I have to point out that the special effects are great. It's a great film to LOOK at, some of the time. But that won't carry a movie. With the exception of a few scenes, it's a repetitive, pointless movie that does nothing to advance OR conclude the storyline that was so good the first time around.<br/><br/>And I haven't even mentioned the Zion Council who dress like Funkadelic, or the part where the good guy-controlled giant machines ""pump their fists"" (which got a good laugh from the audience, as many parts did), or when Neo goes to visit the Wizard of Oz.

","`Everything that has a beginning  Has an end. I see the end coming  I see the darkness spreading  I see death  And you are all that stands in his way.'<br/><br/>And all that is standing in your way of the most highly anticipated film in years is the massive swarm of people ahead of you. Who would have thought a relatively small film called The Matrix in 1999 would eventually spawn one of the greatest film series in movie history? When the original film grossed $171 million at the domestic box office and became a huge cult favorite on DVD, Warner Brothers quickly jumped at the opportunity to role the (supposedly) final two sequels. It took the Wachowski brothers nearly four years and $300 million but the journey is almost over. There are many questions to ask before seeing Revolutions that one must ask himself: How will it end? Will I understand it? Will everything be answered? Can this truly be the final Matrix film? But the most important question to ask may be the most irrelevant: Do we really want it to end? Surely the Warner Brothers executives know their answer.<br/><br/>The story centers once again on the journey of The One (Neo) as he tries to end the war between man and machine after years of conflict. Revolutions picks up exactly where Reloaded left off earlier this year but here is a recap: <br/><br/>Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus lead the human resistance against the machine world for control of the world. For years, the machines have kept human kind plugged into The Matrix, a simulated dream world, and threatened to destroy the last human city known as Zion. Morpheus believes that their journey is almost at an end but there are some that stand in the way of providence. Namely Agent Smith, who was once destroyed by Neo but now has come back to destroy him and everything else. In the final scene of the film, both Neo and Smith (in human form) have been knocked unconscious just as the machines prepare to invade Zion.<br/><br/>Got it? If you don't then too bad because here we go. Without giving too much away, let's just say everything seems to come full circle. As the humans within Zion prepare to duke it out for control of the world against the machines, Neo goes to the machine city to work out a compromise and stop Smith before it is too late for both man and machine. Did you get confused during Reloaded and hate it for that? Then you're not going to like Revolutions. There is a lot to divulge within the course of the two hour feature and Revolutions will require multiple viewings to unlock all the secrets of The Matrix franchise. Outside of the confusing interlocking concepts, does Revolutions deliver a good plot? Though the beginning starts off a little too slow, the rest of the film smoothes out any rough edges and ends the series with a bang.<br/><br/>Most of the cast (outside of a relative few additional members) is the same as it was with The Matrix Reloaded. But in Revolutions, some perform better then others. Keanu Reeves delivers the goods with his role as The One (Neo). Reeves may seem relatively stiff in the film but that is the point. As Smith becomes more and more human, so Neo becomes more and more machine like and acts that way. Reeves does a fabulous job in dragging that point out though many will probably not pick up on that fact. Carrie-Ann Moss takes on the role of Trinity for the final time but isn't as featured as she was in Reloaded, which is both good and bad. The good? The focus of Revolutions is suppose to be on Neo and that is the point. The bad? She has some scenes but not the way many will want her to go out on. The biggest highlight of Revolutions is not the special effects (though they come in a close second) but rather is the performance of Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. Weaving is so over the top with this role that it is just absolutely amazing to watch especially in the final battle sequence between Smith and Neo in the rain. So what is bad? Monica Belluci's Persephone has no point in this film, let alone the entire Matrix series. What does her character do that is of any real importance? Nothing other then bring them the Keymaker in Reloaded but still, what is her purpose? And the biggest disappointment comes from the lack of Morpheus. He is barely shown in the film and deserved more screen time then he got.<br/><br/>Overall, Revolutions may not end the franchise in the way everybody would want but the final confrontation between Smith and Neo at the end is worth the price of admission alone. Does the final film answer all the questions? Thankfully, No. Would anybody really be satisfied if all the answers were given to them on a silver platter with no thought put into divulging the film series' secrets for themselves? No. Will multiple viewing be required to fully understand it? Yes but if you don't feel like paying the price of admission then you will only have to wait till at least May for the DVD. Many will leave the theater disappointed and, in certain aspects, they should. Granted, you had to expect that the film would not end with a picture perfect happy ending like you would want but the ending that is given just doesn't serve the film justice. Some fans will feel cheated, some will feel empty, while others will be too blown away from the battle sequences to fully comprehend or care about the real ending. The final scene of the film is one of those either you love or hate kind of things with no area in between. Bottom line is that Revolutions performs better then Reloaded but doesn't end the franchise the way it should have. How will you feel? That is up to you but like the Oracle says in the film, `We can't see past the choices we don't understand'. So grasp the concept of the film before making your final evaluation.<br/><br/>My Rating: **** ½ out of 5 (Grade: A)"

","The third and final movie in the Matrix Trilogy did not disappoint.  As controversial as that may sound to a lot of people, the Wachowski brothers ended it the way they saw fit, and I wholeheartedly agree with the ending. The first movie enthralled us with the fascinating philosophical concept of the Matrix, and once we had four years to pour over every detail of what the first movie wanted us to know, the second and third don't worry about fleshing out the world of the Matrix and concentrate on telling the story of the Matrix universe.<br/><br/>  Revolutions is not the first ""Matrix.""  It does not owe us completely different overshooting special effects or even more intelligent concepts to mull over.  The first movie dealt with the reality of the Matrix, the second dealt with the reality of Zion, and the final movie is the conclusion of the conflict between the two worlds.  It is an epic.  Those of us who want to pretend the Matrix is a tight, compact movie with a limited physical and mental scope are kidding themselves.  The trilogy is a massive epic spanning a huge universe (as fleshed out by the Animatrix) that concludes with a huge leap backward, looking back on all the involved universes of the Matrix, Zion, and the Earth caught in the middle.<br/><br/>  Spectacular cinematography... the choreography of the fights was beautiful, and the themes of love and ying/yang are proper.  The relationship between forces like Neo/Trinity, Morpheus/Naobi, the Oracle/Architect, machine/human truly pervades the last movie against a backdrop of an amazing fantasy world.  The action fits well with this final clash between machines and humans, and Neo's role as the intervention between both forces is spectacular.<br/><br/>  As controversial to fans of the first Matrix movie this ending may seem, take a step back and look at the trilogy and the Animatrix as one huge movie telling one huge story in one huge universe.  The climax of a truly well-done film is not always anti-climactic and deeply intellectual.  The Matrix is an epic; the innovate cinematography and mind-bending philosophy behind it make it stand out above many a film."

","Matrix: Revolutions will be one of the hardest movies to review this year. Filmed at the same time as Matrix: Reloaded, but theatrically released six months apart, the Wachowski brothers (Larry and Andy) intended for the movie to be critiqued as one long film with an extended intermission.  The problem is that if you tease an audience months earlier with a film that ends in a cliffhanger and then make them wait half a year,  their expectations will be through the clouds.  People will expect Revolutions to be greater than Reloaded simply because we are conditioned to seeing sequels that turn up the violence, body count, special effects and anything else that can be improved upon from the original.  <br/><br/>But let's think about this for a second.  At the time of release, the two Matrix films really had no equal.  Back to the Future II and III were filmed back to back in the 80's, but they were released in two separate calendar years with stories that went in two different directions.  Other than the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which has yet to screen the third in the series, never before has a franchise shot one complete film and then split the whole into separate parts.  <br/><br/>So as a lone film in the series, Revolutions does disappoint compared to the groundwork laid in the previous two.  Where the original and Reloaded had cutting edge special effects and fight scenes never before caught on 70mm, Revolutions goes through the motions of showing us the exactly what we have come to expect, just for longer and in different locations.  And where the first two films brought surprises around every corner, you can see Revolutions play out before the characters do.  <br/><br/>Also adding to the disappointment is the lack of recurring characters in Revolutions.  The previous film brought us such new and interesting characters as The Keymaker, Persephone, The Architect, and Merovingian, all of which are either missing or have such little screen time in Revolutions that by the time you remember their name, they disappear forever.  And the two electrifying twins from Reloaded, become the Boba Fett of the fantasy film vault (i.e. being one of the most intriguing villains to get no screen time in the concluding film). <br/><br/>This disappointment aside, the movie has incredible visuals.  The scene where the Sentinels breach Zion and begin their destruction of human kind is a feast for the eyes.  Humans don walking metal gun ships and put up a fight that would make even George Lucas ask `how'd they do that' questions.  There is more humor in this film that the other two combined, and the final act does contain a few revelations and a non-Hollywood style ending that is always refreshing in genre films. <br/><br/>But, what makes it hard to review is that if the movie was indeed played as intended viewing by the directors (4 hours of mind and bum numbing action), we would all be praising the film for being the most cutting edge, special-effect laden film of all time.  Instead, we spent weeks speculating, anticipating and formulating ideas as to how good the third one must me to close off the series.  Maybe it will play out better on DVD."

","I think Revolutions does a lot for the series in terms of raising the series quality rather than lowering it further from Reloaded. The first was a landmark and a breathtaking movie, but the sequel was seen by most as far over the top in its action sequences. The third manages to land on the ground again with some absolutely spectacular moments and some interesting choices of characters and locales - the last in the series managing to be thought provoking. I also think that after Revolutions, people may like Reloaded a little more after seeing its importance and position in the middle of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good end to the trilogy and a great action flick.

","***** WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD *****<br/><br/>I just got done seeing Matrix: Revolutions, and I must say, I was impressed. Most everyone else was looking for some deeper meaning, but I, for one, was happy with the way things turned out. It was fairly obvious, yes, but it was a beautiful way to get there. I was very impressed with the Christian symbolism, as well as the eastern religions' symbolism. Seeing Neo 'crucified' and giving his own life for humanity showed that The Wachowski Brothers really did have something in mind when they kicked off this crazy train ride.<br/><br/>The cinematography and CGI were much better in this one than they were in Reloaded. Specifically, the Neo vs. Super Smith scene was incredibly crafted. My thanks to the entire special effects team for that entire sequence. It truly showed two gods battling it out (i.e. Jesus vs. Satan) for dominance.<br/><br/>The changeup in actresses for the Oracle was seamless, and though I understand the reasoning behind what happened, I didn't seem to think it was necessary to explain the change in appearance. It was a rather throwaway explanation, and the actress did a fine job of impersonating the original Oracle, that I think she would have simply been accepted in the part.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved the symbolism, the dialogue, the scenes with the mech-armor. I feel that this was the best looking out of the three films, but the original still has it overall as the best of the trilogy. Great movie, great trilogy! Thank you, Wachowskis!"

","Let's be honest, reloaded and revolutions were a single film split into two for no other reason than to make more money. It is certainly true that we had enough material in the two films to make a reasonable sequel. More to the point we had enough material to make a film that could quite easily live in the same company as Show Girls and Battlefield Earth. The dialogue is so unbelievably pompous and serious it is frequently quite unintentionally funny. The highlight must be the ""I can tell from your face"" line delivered to Neo. I never really noticed a single change in facial expression from Keanu throughout the movie. <br/><br/>I'm quite sure that word of mouth will kill off this film quite quickly. The only people I'd recommend this film for are the people that enjoyed reloaded.

","The Matrix was a very conventional film: strong on story, jokes, and great action. Reloaded focused less on story and more on film as art to influence your brain directly through moving light and sound. Revolutions has more storytelling than Reloaded, more action than either the first two(though not as immediately satisfying) and definitely had the biggest impact on my brain of the three. While I watched it I was amazed many times and amused few times but didn't ever realize what an impact it had on my consciousness until I was leaving the theatre, very sneaky!<br/><br/>The action scenes are long and dense which can be a bit exhausting making it harder to sit through the necessary quieter scenes of storytelling. This film also seemed a bit more hokey than the previous two matrix films but considering the mind-expansion impact it had I must say that it must have been exactly as planned.<br/><br/>I thought Reloaded, which was close to perfection, was the best in the trilogy but this film succeeds in its own way.

","Granted, it's difficult, if not impossible, to capture the surprise and awe of the debut of a revolutionary film style and plot concept. This, the third (and dimmest) view into the Matrix, falls even shorter than the second (Reloaded) by showing us little we haven't seen before.  It starts right where we left off at the end of Reloaded - Neo is seemingly still comatose, with sentinels drilling their way down to Zion.  The next two hours is nothing but an occular exercise in fight scenes and special effects, while still trying to stimulate the heart and brain with philosophical and religious metaphors spoken in techno-babble (it's all GEEK to me) that were already revealed in Reloaded.  But, rest assured, there is still plenty of action to go around - a little less of the martial arts fights (with little ""bullet-time"" shots), but more shoot-em-up's than the first or second, and no sex scene (save for a brief nipple twist in a hell-like club). <br/><br/>
Time is spread more evenly to all characters, making it less of a Keanuisance (which is best since he's even forced to try to act without his eyes now).  Thankfully, the weird dreadlocked albino ghost twins don't reappear.  Speaking of ghosts, the actress who played the Oracle in the first two movies died unexpectedly before filming, so her replacement gives an explanation for her change in appearance.  Agent Smith becomes a key factor, but his motivation remains a mystery - he hated the Matrix in the first place, yet now he's populating it with duplicates of himself. Meanwhile he's still bent on fighting Neo.  Go figure.  When it's all over, one can't help feeling unfulfilled.  There are still some unanswered questions, with the Wachowski brothers placating with the obligatory possible return to this slightly greenish world.

"jigmeg","Null","0","0","5 November 2003"," Revolution, or Disillusion? a Review of MATRIX 3 B...
","Revolution, or Disillusion? a Review of MATRIX 3 By Jiggy<br/><br/>Readers, if you have not been following this trilogy for the past 4 years (The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded, and now The Matrix Revolutions) you must be living under a rock, or so plugged into the `system' that your on-board software won't allow you to see the truth, for fear of being terminated by your own version of Agent Smith (Ego, Obscurations, Kleshas, Inhibitions, Perceptions of social control, or Fear of movie theatres and/or Chinese VCD shops, etc.). For the benefit of those just becoming `unplugged' and seeing one of the Wachowski brother's dissertations on the meaning of life, liberty and search for truth for the very first time, let's quickly bring ya up to speed. In short, the trilogy revolves around Nemo (Keanu Reeves: well known in KTM for his role as Prince Siddhartha in the film Little Buddha) and Nemo's journey of self and worldly discovery; a classic epic set in a sci-fi not-so-distant future, where machines rule (ala T1 thru T3) and where humans are enslaved - as yet another variation of an X-File.<br/><br/>I remember screening Matrix 1 back in '99; I had just lost quit my job, sold all my possessions, and in short, was having an early mid-life crisis and asking `What's it all about?  Why do I feel I'm just a cog in a machine? Are things really what they seem?'  So I was stunned to have a movie fit so auspiciously into my life just when I had gotten `off the grid' as they say. I used proceeds of my used college-book sale to view the movie dozens of times, examining every aspect of this movie's spiritual connotations, religious references, and philosophical conundrums.   I began to think that I was, in fact Nemo, or a real-life version of him - sans the ability to dodge bullets in slow-mo or afford a really cool black leather trench coat. I even began looking at any potential GF like she had to be a re-incarnation of Trinity - the movie's love interest.  (I want a girl with a mind like a diamond / I want a girl who knows what's best / I want a girl with shoes that cut and eyes that burn like cigarettes / I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket - Cake).<br/><br/>Well, four years later and after screening the second installment of the trilogy, The Matrix Reloaded, I had long realized that movies are just that: entertainment!  And they should not be used as a spiritual guide, material for a PhD thesis, or a bible by any means. And entertainment this all is; the Wachowski Brothers, with help from special effects editor and Oscar Winner John Gaeta provide plenty in all three episodes.  Enough to keep even the most diehard hindi-action film freak glued to their seats with the shear quality of it all, even if Trinity never, or ever would, spontaneously break into dance wearing a long but low-cut shiny black leather sari.<br/><br/>Where The Matrix Revolutions differs from its predecessor The Matrix Reloaded (released just 6 months ago and shot at the same time) is that Revolutions offers up the secret of life, liberty, and unplugged happiness that we were not given after the first film, forgot about in the second (due to a mind-warping car chase and multiple spinning self-replicating fight scenes) as a plate of old bones that we can pick through for ourselves after leaving the theatre.  Only this time, the journey of matrix-discovery was propelled along with seemingly tired action scenes and a really lame sound track.<br/><br/>Everything that has a beginning has an end, so the movie poster says (and I once thought that tripe like that was prophetic).  I was glad when this flick ended.  The Revolution is indeed over.  And unlike what Gil Scott Heron predicted in the Black American '70s, this Revolution will be televised, and is now being merchandised, plagiarized, and even corporatized long before The Matrix Revolution spreads to theatres world-wide. Perhaps that's the true meaning of the title, `revolutions' like in revolving charge cards or department store doors.  Well readers, see it today at Jai Nepal or purchase at your local chinese VCD shop, and then tell me if I am wrong in being disillusioned with the whole shebang.<br/><br/>THE BOTTOM LINE A Must See for those who saw the first two; a decent film to see at Jai -if ya are in need of an adrenalin fix, and a Skip if you would rather save your money to see a new movie starring Preity Zinta.<br/><br/>Reviewer's Bio: Jiggy Gaton is the pen name for a new WAVE contributor, who not only spends a lot of his time watching films and searching for the meaning of life, but is also selling a used long black trench coat, cheap.

","The Matrix Revolutions is extremely successful in making the audience not care one iota about any of the characters that we cared so much for in the previous two Matrix movies.  Ultimately, the movie has three flaws: 1) the dialogue  2) the story  3) the acting.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS COULD BE AHEAD but I will try to talk generalities***<br/><br/>How can we expect to care about anything going on when the dialogue is boring at best and utterly absurd at worst?<br/><br/>How can one expect to be entertained by a movie that focuses so much on ""The Matrix"" when about 75% of the movie takes place outside of the Matrix?<br/><br/>Not that I expect much from Keanu ""Ted"" Reaves, but he delivers an exceptionally awful performance and the entire rest of the cast follows him. Morpheus probably has the worst performance of all, but it isn't entirely his fault as he turns into a complete pansy in this film.<br/><br/>All of the Zion scenes, simply put, suck.  Even for a sci-fi film, I can't believe or buy into anything that happens.  Apparently, the wonderfully designed robot suits don't need protection for the pilot.  Apparently the machines will ignore everyone when it it time to reload or when someone is simply marching around with a rocket launcher.  The machines do not act in a rational manner.  Don't even get me started on the ""truce""...<br/><br/>Having no other way out, the Wachowski brothers simply take the easy way out when they basically nullify everything that the architect said in Matrix Reloaded.  The architect had one of the best scenes with the most intelligent dialogue in modern movie history.  Yet, it is this scene that painted the Wachowski's into a corner.  So, instead of creating a kick-ass way for Neo to fulfill the prophecies predicted by the architect, yet still save everyone, they simply say, ""the architect is a liar"" and leave it at that.<br/><br/>I could go on for hours (and in fact have at work with others who have scene the film) but, ultimately this movie fails on virtually every level.  Very little martial arts, with weak action scenes and unrealistic even for sci-fi standards battles make this a terrible movie watching experience."

","The Matrix Revolutions is a masterpiece. Based on critical reviews and reviews I've just heard people saying around here, I've just sent a great many of you into a spiral of anger, but for those who are undecided about this movie: see it. For those who think it's an abomination that ruins the series, open your eyes. In the words of Bane when he's possessed ""Look past the skin, past these gelatinous cattle-eyes and see your true enemy."" Now while this movie is not your enemy, you must look past the skin and dig deeper. Many people say that Reloaded was too much talk, not enough action(I seriously wonder if they fell asleep during the ""Burly Brawl"" as it's been dubbed, and the freeway chase but that's another story) but The Matrix was never simply an action movie, even the supposedly infallible first film had it's fair share of talk, in fact it did that more than any of the others. Reloaded did what a sequel should: it grabbed you with action, but didn't necessarily develop the plot or characters as much as it could have. Revolutions wraps it all up, tying up most of the loose ends while presenting one or two just for the viewers to chew on. Obviously some will have a problem with an ending that doesn't answer every single question they have, but I found it to be a perfect conclusion to a near-perfect series. I also like how it focused its attentions to the more minor characters rather than the Holy Trinity(pardon the pun) of Trinity, Neo and Morpheus. I could go on and on, but in the end you've probably already made up your mind whether or not you're going to see the movie and maybe even if you're going to love or hate it. Go in with an open mind and a pair of open eyes and I guarantee you'll walk away satisfied with some wonderful conversations to have with others who have seen it."

Some people have told me that they were confused after Reloaded.  This should answer any questions they may have.  If it doesn't answer your questions then you might need ritalin because you have no attention span.  Sci-Fi is not for everyone, so I understand if some people did not enjoy these films, but I personally did.  The movie was about two sides of a war.  The dominant sides weapons grew beyond their own control and so the machines reluctantly required help from their enemy.  Because Neo helped the enemy peace was had by all. The thing I love most is the Matrix's style.  The clothes, color scheme, choreography, music, and lighting were simply terrific.  I could really tell that the Wachowski's were highly influenced by comics.  An understanding of the art of comics might help you enjoy the film as much as I did.

","I loved where The Wachowski Brothers took Reloaded and Revolutions, deciding to grow the franchise into an epic opposed to churning out serials based on the original. The Matrix Revolutions is a well crafted third act based on that direction. One of the strengths of the trilogy has been the fact that everything isn't explained through expositional dialog. A good example of this would be the Neo/Smith brawl after the Oracle in Reloaded. This scene establishes three things; that Neo is stronger than any single Smith, battling the Smith hordes is futile, and the Smith hordes will eventually win. Without this deeper meaning, the films fall apart. All the scenes I've heard people complain about have this deliberate deeper meaning. The only major shortcoming that I see in Revolutions is that it is unabashedly a third act; this film does not stand alone."

Personally I think they should have explored more of the things we haven't seen yet (such as near the end) and put some more history to it, and left out the drama between the civilians at Zion which seemed over done and out of place.  I did enjoy the Smith character in this movie, but was hopeing for a little longer of a battle with neo.  The previews highlight the battle between Neo and Smith, showing hundreds of Smiths surrounding the fight, and let me down a little with the way the battle was different from the second movie.  It's hard to tell why the movie was not as good as I hope for without ruining it.

","I went to the screening with the advice to think of 'Thomas Anderson' as name derived from the Greek word ""andras"" - to mean 'man,' thus Neo could, perhaps, be a personification of ""son of man."" I was even told to see Neo as having been saved/resurrected by a kiss from a character called Trinity in the previous film. This concluding film begins where it left off at 'Matrix Reloaded.' At long last, the task of analyzing the trilogy becomes easier with this stunning conclusion of the trilogy. ""Everything that has a beginning has an end.""  This film does offer the end. It gives sense to what Neo is all about. It reveals his purpose and that through his discovery of his purpose, the audience can start piecing together the symbolic purposes of Morpheus, Trinity, Agent Smith, and the Bane character. It's through their dialogue and actions in this film, the philosophical and theological meanings of trilogy become clear, opening up the reality that the salvation of human beings is only possible as a result of one essential deed of Neo. This film captures a lot of important themes: will power and faith, death, betrayal, the Coming of Christ - themes that make the audience realize the power of faith is greater than the dreamer's will. Even the definition of 'Matrix' comes clear with this film. I thought that the inclusion if the 'holy-child' Sati is clever as her final appearance and dialogue unlocks the important message this film is giving.<br/><br/>One has to see this film to believe how extreme, advanced and complex digital technology can be. The film exposes the audience to an incredibly explosive journey through loads of uncannily mind-blowing CGI special effects, artwork and phenomenal groundbreaking actions. Definitely an unforgettable impact for the eyes! This stunning conclusion takes Neo on a journey that includes his search of the Architect (perhaps the aggressive God of the Gnostic gospel), his reunion with the Agents (Herod, as defined in New Testament, to mean the many rulers connected with the early history of Christianity?)  then to what appears to be a train station ('No Man's Land' where trains do depart for Tibet?), his trip to Hel - all in his quest to save the citizens of Zion and the rebels.<br/><br/>Just watching the swarms of sinister steely, octopus-like Sentinels rage upon the Zion military and the volunteers, with such astounding forces, is worth the price of a regular tix. The spectacularly dramatic war siege is like nothing I've seen before on screen.  The hypnotic sounds of the music scores compliment the exhilarating experience further.  The characters are very interesting to follow. Hugo Weaving offers some unusual dark humor to his Smith character(s).<br/><br/>Matrix plunges the viewers to the `Womb' (Garden of Eden?) of Adam and Eve's original sin. Humans have used knowledge for materialism and bringing artificial intelligence and deceit that's enhanced by the construction of someone else's creation. The 'womb' then becomes the breeding ground for intelligent machines are generating electricity from humans. Matrix Reloaded explores freewill and determinism and speaks of the coming of the prophesized messiah called Thomas Anderson (Greek ""andras"" for man, thus ""son of man."") who will be saved by a character called Trinity. It's the resurrected Neo that can defeat the evil agents within the Matrix. Both the first and second films seem to stress on humanity's problem as ""sleeping in ignorance in a dreamworld."" Only by waking up to wisdom and enlightenment can bring solution to that problem. The second of the trilogy reveals that freedom, of choice and dignity can have their implications. This third film harps on the One, who, by reason of his destiny, learns that what appears to be the real world is an illusion he has to manipulate with his will. It also highlights on the concept of human faith vs. the dreamer's will and offers an insight to what it means by destiny, choice, purpose and the will to belief.  It's watching human faith replacing the dreamer's will.<br/><br/>
Is it impossible for the humans to rid themselves of their own created problems? What if they don't come to terms with their religious beliefs and faith?  The audience sees a Neo discovering his purpose. He must take control of his unconscious dream world, face reality and recognize his ultimate destiny. He has to make the powerful Agent Smiths subject to his will in order to fulfill his destiny of suffering, dying and ultimately resurrecting.  Is Neo a symbolic Christ who'll save those willing to have faith in him? Seems likely. Could the Matrix actually be a representation of the Garden of Eden where man's original sin sets forth the human suffering? Is Ian Bliss' Bane a symbol of the biblical Judas, perhaps, who'll prevent Neo from showing the way for the rest of humanity?  Is Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus the Peter, or head of the Church, who'll keep reminding the world to hold their faith in the Savior and await his coming? What about Agent Smith? Could he be a personification of the mighty Herod?  Herod, in the New Testament, was the name of many rulers connected with the early history of Christianity. Perhaps, that explains the many Smith clones encountered onscreen.  As for the last few lines from the young Sati. are they intended to remind us of Christ's resurrection?  Is Sati supposed to become the 'Golden Child', chosen as the next Dalai Lama? Even this last of the trilogy doesn't really offer an easy explanation to the Wachowski brothers' intended philosophical and theological meanings.  One viewer's guess is as good as another. and that's why their three films are so amazingly interesting. ""Everything that has a beginning has an end.""  This film does offer the end. I had a terrific time watching and analyzing the characters and actually felt totally 'fulfilled' at its finale. I'D LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS FILM!!! A"

","PLOT SPOILERS<br/><br/>Matrix 3 is the third in one of the most lucrative Science Fiction films of all time. When the first came out it was intially a 'sleeper' but gradually gained momentum and popularity. Matrix 1 was a groundbreaking film and in all fairness it was ALWAYS going to be a hard act to follow. Matrix 2 was guilty of at times being overbloated, pretentious dialouge and sagging in some scenes where it nearly came to a grounding halt. But it took a lot of flak for not living up to the original film when in reality it should have just been taking as it was. A filler for the fitting climax. And a climax M3 is. Initially I thought it would lapse into the gobbdleygook like the tail end of M2. And in all fairness it very nearly does. The disjointed train man scenes seemed to serve as a filler. And it seems to move along to briskly at times. Some of the scenes appear to be cobbled together and the dialouge is as M2 bordering cheesy at times. But it all serves as build up to the climatic scene and the breathtaking battle for Zion. Anyone looking for clarity after M2 will be slightly dissapointed. The plot is as convoluted as ever but ther fact remains visually the the matrix series remains the most groundbreaking science fiction series for SFX than any other film and one of the most influential trilogies of all time that will remain so for decades to come. Those who spend to time criticising the apparant descent and downward spiral of Matrix would do well to remember Star Wars and its subsequent sequels. As groundbreaking as Star Wars was the original trilogy ended with the painful image of Ewoks with cute squeeky voices. Be glad that M3 didnt go that way."

","I think that's the best way to describe this one.  The second installment, while great, had a little too much cheese in my opinion.  Morpheus's speech, Trinity's ""I'm never letting go"" line, etc.  This movie has some sick action (especially the battle in zion) and some of the classic Smith speeches we all love.  I gave the first Matrix 10 (since no 9.5 is available), Second an 8 and this one a solid 9/10.  Well worth the cost of a ticket to experience the sound.

","First, the overall visual effects are stunning in this movie, but not of the cool bullet time variety found in the first movie.  This movie was done on a more epic scale though that does cause problems.  Worth the price of admission just for this.<br/><br/>That said, this is a basic run of the mill action epic.  Nothing more or less.  No real thought is required before or after.  A few points of ""oh, that's how that worked"", but far far more unanswered questions.  This movie is basically an overly-long shoot-out and not much more.  Just enough plot to bring the films to a conclusion, but nothing is all that unpredictable.<br/><br/>
Too many characters the last two movies are just thrown in with no real purpose, and many of them come and go to no real effect.  I guess in the end I have to say this film is redundant.  Nothing really new was added in regards to cool weapons, characters, plot and the biggest disappointment is nothing much is revealed about the nature of the Matrix that we didn't already know.  The ending itself was very predictable.<br/><br/>I never thought I would say this, but I was relieved when it was all over and I wish that I had stopped watching after two so that at least my imagination could fill in a far better ending.  Very very uncreative and rather disappointing."

","It's awesome to watch, a visual treat. Has everything we've come to expect from the Matrix, and more. It delves deeper philosophically, taking its lead from Reloaded, but in a more satisfying way. The first third of the movie tends to get most of the philosophy out of the way which leaves the greasy goodness of the action, which is what most of the fans would want anyway. We talk of the implications and the possibilities of the ending to this trilogy, and while the storyline didn't live up to all the possibilities I had envisioned, I still felt happy. The battle scenes were so mind numbingly expansive, the visuals intriguing, that I just ended up soaking it all in and not really thinking about it too much. If this film is going to fail with the fans anywhere, it will probably be in the ending. But then it's not really that bad an ending. What can I say? I liked it. 8/10"

","*MILD SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I JUST saw it, on IMAX to boot. It's funny reading the user comment IMDB chose to post, because it's pretty obvious the guy didn't see the film. Anyone who gives this film a 1 out of 10 is obviously just looking to get flamed, to be completely honest. The film was, in a word, awesome - excellent visuals (tell me that one bullet time sequence with Neo punching Smith didn't look simultaneously completely cool and extremely funny!), coupled with several very emotionally impactful scenes (yes, even involving Keanu, who seemed to me far less ""wooden"" than he did in Reloaded) as well as well-placed moments of humour, dramatic tension, awestruck wonder (the Logos breaching the scorched sky comes to mind) and of course martial arts action. It was nice to see that tall Aussie actor (you know, the guy from ""The Road Warrior"" who played the Ultralight pilot) making a cameo as the Trainman, as well. I also like that if not all, then MOST of the loose ends from Reloaded were tied up. For example, you realise with the Oracle's help why the Architect said all that he said - which I will not give away here. Suffice it to say, he does believe that he is correct regarding the outcome of the machines' attack on Zion, but his reasoning is based strictly on pure logic, without factoring in emotion, love and desire to the equation.<br/><br/>
*SOMEWHAT LESS MILD SPOILERS*<br/><br/>My only extremely minor gripe is with the ending - while it's clear that there is peace at last, I would have liked to see how it played out in both worlds. For example, it appears that the Matrix continues to exist, but is it there for programs alone? Apparently, all humans connected to the Matrix will be released - so what would ultimately happen to the machines? As for Neo, what about him? How exactly did he defeat Smith? I personally believe that the Deus ex Machina tricked Smith, using Neo as a conduit to destroy his program once and for all. I just wish I knew what really happened with Neo after Smith was defeated, reverting back to a certain program in the process. It's obvious that either they (the Bros. W) are leaving things somewhat ambiguous in order for there to either be one more film, if they decide to pursue that path, or leaving the ultimate fate of mankind, machinekind and Neo himself to the extrapolation of the viewers themselves. I tend to think the latter is the case, and more power to the Bros. for respecting the intelligence of the audience. Anyhow, as a fitting conclusion to the Matrix concept, I'm giving it a 10 out of 10. If you disagree, challenge my perceptions of what I've seen - I doubt you'll be able to!"

","Before you read, let me warn you that my comments will be full of spoilers.<br/><br/>
The Matrix Revolutions appears to be a good installment in this trilogy called The Matrix. The special effects are there, the Martial Arts are there, and of course, those conversations riddled with philosophical messages are there.<br/><br/>But the Matrix soon starts to decompose into just another piece of celluloid. By the time the war between men and machine begins, this movie is almost impossible to follow. We see nothing but special effects assaulting our eyes as the Sentinels enter the city of Zion. Bullets fly,  the city is being destroyed, and for more than just a few minutes, Neo (the main character) is nowhere to be seen.<br/><br/>And here come the spoilers:<br/><br/>Neo decides to negotiate a truce between man  and machine just when the machines seem to be winning. How? By promising the machines he will defeat Agent Smith. At this point, more than a few characters we care for have lost their lives, and I am sure people want to see a happy ending, and there can be no happy ending when some of the characters we care for are dead.<br/><br/>
The movie ends in a way that makes absolutely no sense. Because men and machine cannot co-exist. I won't elaborate. But it is obvious to me that this is not a true ending."

"thedude710","9","0","0","5 November 2003"," Disappointing
","First off, I am a hige fan of The Matrix and Reloaded.  I felt that Reloaded lived up to The Matrix considering it is a sequal.  I love these two movies mostly for the philosophical views and story line but also for the unique fighting scenes.  I have seen the first Matrix many many times and always leave with something new even now when i see it.  Same for Reloaded, although Reloaded is not a complex, there still are sooo many levels to the story to explore.<br/><br/>Now, for Revolutions...I just came back from the movie, and i am extremely sad to say I am disappointed.  The first 30 or so minutes were amazing, they lived up to the the other two films.  After that, the movie started to go down hill.  All the characters that we love are hardly in the movie. Morph, Trin, Neo and in this movie for no more than 20 minutes.  It seems like they put The Merovingian and The Architect in for *beep* and giggles.  These two were in it for a whole 30 seconds.  No agents, no new interesting characters, nothing.<br/><br/>Fight scenes...the movie is pretty much made up of 2 fight scenes which take up 1 and a half hours.  I did not find anything unique in these long long scenes and i hardly saw anything of what the matrix is known for, Vis-a-Vis amazing kung foo and wire work.  It was more like Smith and Neo punching for 5 seconds then taking a break then going to figh again.  With Zion and the squidies, it was visually well done but was nothing new.<br/><br/>The Plot...I came out of the movie not having to think... Unlike the other two films, this movie lays it out for you in full view so there isnt any thinking involved.  I feel they chose the most obvious way to explain and end the story.<br/><br/>One other problem... In the first two films, everything that happened was in some way explained in that same movie. It wasnt explained directly but that is what made these movies so good.  In Revolutions, either things are explained completely or, more likely, they are not explained at all...How did Neo see?  Why was it Orange? things like that.<br/><br/>Over all, I have no idea what I would rate this movie...I am going to see it once more hoping that I will see something I didn't the first time.  As for now, I consider the story of The Matrix a two part movie, not a trilogy...WHAT WERE THE BROTHERS THINKING??"

"ldayton","Null","0","0","5 November 2003"," A second sequel, a second disappointment
","The original Matrix took a creative story concept and turned it into a stylistic masterpiece that quickly became one of the most influential films in recent memory. But The Matrix Reloaded suffered a classic case of sequelitis: while it included signature action sequences that were worth plunking down ten bucks to see on the big screen, the storyline quickly got bogged down in ""Matrix mythology,"" heavy on the strained religious parallels and confusing double talk. Which movie does The Matrix Revolutions resemble more? Sadly, the answer is The Matrix Reloaded - so much so, in fact, that Revolutions moviegoers who haven't seen Reloaded first will likely be hopelessly lost (and it wouldn't hurt those who have seen Reloaded to watch it again before heading out to the theater).<br/><br/>Revolutions again provides some good reasons to fork over the greenbacks at the box office, including a 20-minute-plus battle for the city of Zion and an all- too-brief appearance by a briefly-clad Monica Bellucci, but those hoping for a clarification of the concepts and characters introduced in Reloaded will walk out mostly disappointed. Laurence Fishburne is woefully underused this time around in favor of an expanded role for the bland Jada Pinkett Smith, and the climactic battle between Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) is unsatisfying at best. The movie's final scene leaves the door open for even more sequels, but unless writer/directors the Wachowski brothers can find a way to recapture the jaw-dropping magic of the first film, they probably shouldn't bother.

","I saw this movie last night at a warner bros. screening.  The MD of warner brothers introduced the movie, telling us to by all means enjoy the movie but to resist and not tell our friends about it.  At first I thought, this is going to be great!!  then, after a couple of hours realised that word-of-mouth might kill the box office receipts.  A man was standing in the corner of the theatre with night vision goggles killing anyone's attempt at piracy on the day.  Well, the movie.....sucked to be honest.  Both the Matrix 1 and 2 blew me away, the visuals, the damn right coolness of the entire thing had never been seen before.  Sadly, the final chapter offers nothing new.  There's no exhilliration at seeing Neo take off, no gasps at bullet time (which is hardly used).  Too much time is spent out of the matrix, which makes for mundane visuals of sweaty, dirty sweaters.  Don't get me wrong, the attack of the sentinels is great, but, ok, thousands of sentinals creating a blur and guys in Aliensesque machines with machine guns that need to be reloaded every 5 minutes by the pesky teenager that kept licking Keanu's derriere in Reloaded.  At one point, I won't spoil the setting, a ship is being bombarded by sentinels and an army of machines are heading towards it when Neo suddenly has a brainwave.....let's fly above them, there are too many of them for me to handle.  Well of all the getaways in movies, flying above them (they obviously can only go left or right) is a cop out.  I could continue for hours but I won't.  however, I will mention the cheese that resonates throughout the movie. Ok ok we know....humans against machines, but come on this is a sci-fi movie that made us applaud and tell everyone how great it was, it's not a sunday matinee repleted with people saying I love you all the time (not just Neo and Trinity either). I've never written anything about a movie before but this really really disappointed me.  I know you'll all still go and watch it, I don't blame you, I did.

","After all this time, all the hype, all the talk of `the future of movie making', anything short of the original film's impact was going to be a disappointment and Revolutions, more so than Reloaded, comes up shorter than Frodo Baggins. Visually innovative effects have fallen by the wayside, replaced instead with yet more overblown, in your face cinematic fireworks as the audience struggles to find any sense in the plot or any empathy with the characters. Neo and Trinity's romance is about as convincing as Charles and Di's, while the talents of Monica Bellucci are once again criminally wasted as the story fails to tie up loose ends, or indeed satisfy in any way. It's still a spectacle in places, particularly some of the action inside of Zion, and if you like your movies flashy, loud and devoid of logic, you'll be ok.

","The Matrix was all about mystery and intrigue and suspense of the matrix, thats why it was so popular, it had ideas very seldom explored and fight scenes very seldom created to look so real<br/><br/>The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions are completely different films because we already know what the matrix is, the wachowski`s didnt want to make another mystery which would undermine the mystery of the matrix, the fight scenes are the same because this is not the Axis or Plasticman where new techniques are employed, Bullet time is a part of the Matrix and was kept as a part of reloaded and revolutions because that is a part of the action scenes core in these movies, only that it was made better in reloaded and revolutions, the only addition was virtual cinematography in that they made the most human lookalikes we have seen on screen, while many common movie goers didnt realise the breakthrough they made in this, its still a breakthrough, although not as big as bullet time but it still is, remember that bullet time is the essence of the fighting scheme in the Matrix, bullet time is there because the speed and impossibility of the scenes and you want to look slowly and closely, Reloaded combined Virtual Cinematography and Bullet time when Neo goes spinning in the air with the pole. video game graphics or not video game graphics that is the closest to CGI humans zoomed in we have ever seen, and probably will ever see in a while.<br/><br/>Revolutions was about the philosophy of the matrix, with what is the matrix known, the mystery known and the intrigue out of the way, Reloaded was now solely putting its story pattern on How neo is going to save Zion and if he really can save it, Remember that the original just showed us what is the Matrix, we were so enthralled, there was no need to explore any further, this time what was explored was what is Zion, which brings us to the pacing of the movie, Zion had to be paced slowly and matrix quicker because we know what the matrix is but knew hardly anything about What is Zion, Who are the people of Zion and What kind of values and beliefs they carry.<br/><br/>Revolutions on the other hand is the resolution of the story once and for all, it is the end of this particular story, it explains what happens to neo and it tells us how it happens, I dont need to explain the action scenes as they speak for themselves in TV spots but the story is important here, The story is about Neo saving Humans in Zion and Rogue programs in the Matrix, Remember that Neo is here to save the world, save humanity, a Machine program can also be human like a rogue program for instance Sati, who is the formation of two rogue programs the two indian people who loved and produced Sati, Sati is acknowledgment that the Matrix was not only a slave for the humans but it became the breeding ground of programs who thought they were human and which acted human, Neo chose to save both, if he just destroyed the Matrix, those hundreds of rogue programs who are as human as they come (Merovingian is a perfect example of being human, he wanted more and more power and was greedy and malicious, this is a characteristic of an evil human), he couldnt let both forms of humanity die, even if one was real to him one was not, but both could think, hate and love and fight, Neo realised from the Oracle that she desperately wanted to survive and let other rogue programs survive too, why else do you think as a rogue program she wanted to help Neo destroy the Matrix. she never said i will help you in destroying the Matrix, remember in Reloaded she said the only way to get there is together, that is the time the path of neo as the savior of the WORLD began and it ended when Neo says ""Because I chose to"".<br/><br/>So before all this monotonous thinking that Matrix story is better than the other and this is better than the other is all false, the story is all one, it is the journey of Neo from realising that he like Jesus was not only the savior of those who believed in him, but that he would be the saviour of all humans in all forms colors and shapes, thus the power of christianity, because he gave his life to protect his own disciples and so people realise he did this for everyone to finally believe in him"

","It was quite a good movie, but was hampered by a weak and convoluted plot, as well as far too many christian analogies.  It seems like they tried to hard to outdo the special effects of other movies, including the original, and forgot to make a clear and crisp storyline.  It doesnt live up to the 1st, and is about equal to Revolutions.  All-in-all though it is still good and very entertaining.  I would definatley recomend it."

","I was lucky enough to catch an advance screening of the Matrix Revolutions in D.C., and I would say that the type of film the Matrix started out to be really didn't carry through to the end; though, I would also say that this isn't such a bad thing.  I thought the cinematography near the end was superb, I was sincerely caught up in the tension, and I suppose the only thing that bothered me was that I wanted the storyline to go in a different direction.<br/><br/>**Warning: Possible spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>I guess with that type of story, with trying to explain some semblance of existence, there are only so many results you can end on.  You can rework old ideas in new ways, and no pun intended here, but Jesus, isn't there some other way of supporting human existence than martyrdom?<br/><br/>To be fair, it was a great blending of the West and the East in terms of religious ideas.  Maybe I was looking for some sort of answer, some sort of transcendent meaning in the film the Waichowsky brothers could have never presented in an entertaining way.  Maybe I just liked the open endedness of the first.<br/><br/>Overall, though, I would say that I was more impressed with the fight scenes, the beautiful choreography of Agent Smith versus Neo, the epic presentation of two god-like characters, and the wonderfully constructed ride of the Battle of Zion than I was with any sort of hint at intellectual exploration of reality.  Whereas the first seemed to have quite a bit of it, the second lacked in it, the third had nearly none of it.<br/><br/>If you liked intellectual side of the Matrix, don't go into the third installment looking for more.  If you liked the ride, you might have some fun."

","I understand that some people expected something a lot ""deeper"" and think they could have come up with a much more clever story than what we were given in this last chapter of the Matrix trilogy.<br/><br/>However, in reality, it answers all the important questions and gives us absolute visual brilliance - probably the BEST I have ever seen (including Return of the King which I viewed just yesterday).<br/><br/>After my first viewing of Revolutions, I was so satisfied I gave it a 9 out of 10. In fact, almost a perfect 10.<br/><br/>However, when I watched it again a second time, I saw some of the flaws and had to lower my score to 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>The flaws I noticed are small, but important. It was dialogue here and there that seemed very second-rate compared to what we're fed in the first Matrix. It was the deliverance of some of the lines. And it was in the performance of one of the key characters: The Oracle.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with the lines is in the rediculous scene between Neo and Trinity after they crash-land their ship in the Machine City. Trinity is about to die and they have this very ""emotional"" moment.<br/><br/>The acting in this scene is really quite bad - especially from Reeves. They are alone on the ship. Not a soul for MILES. And yet they WHISPER their entire dialogue!?!? Why? This scene was also very unnecessarily drawn out - much like the ""disco rave"" scene on Zion in Reloaded - except not as cool.<br/><br/>The story, however, is completed very well. The questions I had after Reloaded were all answered by the film's end.<br/><br/>Also, the sound and visual effects are absolutely stunning! Without a doubt in my mind the best visual feast of any movie ever! Especially the machine city, and Zion's final battle with the sentinals!<br/><br/>Smith's fate ties brilliantly in with Neo. Their final battle is brilliantly choreographed and visual brilliance!<br/><br/>That said, I do feel the last two-thirds of this trilogy (Reloaded and Revolutions) should have been compact into one film. There was simply too much unnecessary fluff.<br/><br/>But, as I said in my summary: I think the STORY itself was absolutely sound, solid, and simply perfect."

","The original `Matrix' is one of the best movies of science fiction I have ever seen. Inclusive it is ranked as #32 in IMDB, so many users of IMDB share my opinion. I was very disappointed with `Matrix Reloaded', but anyway it was a reasonable entertainment. Today I have bought `Matrix Revolutions' on DVD and I really would like to have my money back. Here in Brazil this film was very rejected and most of my friends has not even rented it. Now I can understand the reason why. Inclusive the Brazilian distributor simultaneously released the DVD for rental and sell-through, and this procedure is not common in Brazil. It is amazing how a great concept of future of mankind can be so easily spoiled. The screenplay is full of flaws, there is a total exaggeration in special effects, an awful conclusion, it is unbelievable what some persons in Hollywood do for money. I hope this series is finished, since a `Matrix IV' would be unbearable for my taste. I noted that the actress who performed `The Oracle' (Gloria Foster) in `Matrix' and `Matrix Reloaded' died on 29 September 2001, therefore she was replaced by Mary Alice in `Matrix Revolutions'. `Matrix Reloaded' was her last film. My vote is five.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): `Matrix Revolutions'"

"anselmdaniel","7","1","2","19 October 2019"," An unsatisfying conclusion
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions is the third movie in the Matrix franchise and is the sequel to 2003's The Matrix Reloaded. The movie is directed by The Wachowskis, produced by Joel Silver, written by The Wachowskis and stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving. The movie picks up where The Matrix Reloaded leaves off with the sentinel army breaking through to Zion, Neo is stuck in the machine world, and Smith continues growing in power.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions is the conclusion to The Matrix trilogy. The Matrix Revolutions has grand spectacles in key scenes. The introduction retrieval of Neo from the Merovingian, the battle for Zion, and the final battle between Neo and Smith are awe-inspiring to watch. The movie plays to its strengths visually and it absolutely shows in its production, shots, and cinematography. This movie is a treat to watch visually and audibly. The movie thrives when it is presenting the situations.<br/><br/>The story suffers from the same drawbacks as the The Matrix Reloaded. With only a few months until the movie was released, any of the criticism that was leveled towards The Matrix Reloaded could not be fixed. The movie had to go towards the ending here. The movie still suffers from over bloatedness that plagued the previous movie. This is not helped in this movie as there are many characters that are simply side characters elevated to a higher standing. The audience wants to watch a movie featuring the original characters from The Matrix. Morpheus, Neo, and Trinity should have been the focus and should have been involved in the storylines in The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The story could have built up the characters better and had a more satisfying resolution.<br/><br/>The defense of Zion is pointless knowing the revelation from The Matrix Reloaded. In the movie, the plight of the freed humans is pointless when the revelation is that the machines have predicted them to be wiped out. The machines have also wiped out the humans before. We as the audience know that the fight is futile. The only treat the audience has is that the sequence is pretty to watch with many cool effects on display. Otherwise, there is a lack of tension in the scenes. There are not characters that the audience cares from the start of The Matrix trilogy to the end present in the battle.<br/><br/>The movie heavily draws upon the story with Neo. The movie felt conclusive and even interesting as it brought back the themes from the first Matrix movie. The concluding fight between Neo and Smith is both narratively, visually, and audibly satisfying to the audience. The movie has a super-charged Smith fight against the anomaly of Neo. The conclusion of the battle made sense and rewarded the audience that paid close attention across the three Matrix movies. The conclusion itself may not make sense logically with what the characters state but Neo's own story arc was satisfying to watch.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'The Matrix Revolutions'.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

"TheLittleSongbird","5","1","2","23 February 2017"," After getting off to such a great film, 'The Matrix' trilogy finishes on a fizzling whimper
","'The Matrix' is a genre and film milestone, while it is not one of my all-time favourite films it is still a great, impeccably made and awe-inspiring film and ground-breaking in its visuals and sound that broke boundaries in a way rarely if ever done before.<br/><br/>In 2003, 'The Matrix' boasted two sequels, 'The Matrix Reloaded' and 'The Matrix Revolutions', generally considered critically and to audience not a patch in quality (though more mixed reviews than negatively received). To me, both are vastly inferior and have major problems. At the same time, neither are travesties, there are notable good points.<br/><br/>Hard to say which is the better of the two sequels, they both have similar strengths but also similar flaws with a couple of things done better or worse in the other. Generally it is a shame that after such a great first instalment that 'The Matrix Revolutions' feels largely unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Starting with 'The Matrix Revolutions' good things, the film while not as imaginative as the previous film or as ground-breaking as the original still looks great. The production design is still audacious, the special effects dazzling and uber-cool, very slick editing and cinematography that's both clever and imaginative. There is an epic eeriness to the music score.<br/><br/>While not as astonishing as previously and there is a slight overload of them (with a couple overlong), the action scenes are still very impressive and the awe factor is still there. They benefit from looking great, breathless stunts, a great sense of paranoia, energy and tension. The final battle between Neo and Smith have garnered a mixed reaction, to me it was thrilling stuff and spectacular in mood even if ending on an anti-climactic note.<br/><br/>Lead performances are fine. Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss are cool, Hugo Weaving is deliciously wicked and Laurence Fishburne is imposing and charismatic and doesn't take it too seriously this time even with less to do.<br/><br/>On the other hand, 'The Matrix Revolutions' is particularly crippled by its pacing and dialogue. The pacing is even more problematic here than in 'Reloaded' with the first half especially being so inert the slower and talkier parts feel stillborn.<br/><br/>Dialogue was not a strong suit in 'Reloaded' but it's amplified here, its endlessly and annoyingly cryptic conversations, over-wordiness, over-complicated long sentences and wallowing self-importance add to its increasingly cheesy and stilted feel.<br/><br/>'The Matrix Revolutions' story often doesn't draw one in enough, with a very dull first half that makes one tempted to bail. Although the second half fares better, the sense of wonder is nowhere near as strong and it's masked by too many characters, situations and scenes that are overlong and extraneous so, along with an over-seriousness, it feels too bloated and heavy.<br/><br/>While the leads are good enough, the rest of the acting suffers from sketchy characterisation and poor writing. The ending is abrupt and confused, leaving one with too many unanswered questions which a final film in a trilogy should not do.<br/><br/>Overall, not a travesty but less than great. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
"nicolechan916","6","1","2","22 April 2015"," Good action like before, but with average acting and a mediocre ending.
","As with the prequel, the film does not repeat itself and the story progresses, but it's more or less the same thing. They fight, they talk, they get injured, and they fight some more. To be honest I'm a little disappointed by the way it turned out. The story is still interesting enough to hold your attention, and the action still engaging (though again, prolonged) but it doesn't really do anything for me. I'm following along, but I don't feel connected to the characters anymore.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves' character is pretty stoic and just so flat-toned, that to have most of the characters dependent on his character doesn't support the film enough. There are others, for example in Zion who fight the battle without really depending on Neo to save them, and that was a good addition. It was interesting to watch Gaye's and Watson's character develop and that was missing from the protagonist. Character development.<br/><br/>The ending was pretty sad, but then again too easy. The thing is, movies only focus on 'the special one' and not on the previous failed versions. The film establishes that Neo is not the first, but we aren't given any credible information on to why the others failed and why stoic Neo is the special one â€“ apart from the fact that he can love. Oh, maybe that's why he's stoic, because he's more machine than human? <br/><br/>Still, the series could have been better with more character development, and instead of the similar happenings whenever certain characters meet.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
"Hayhoenstuff","1","1","2","27 December 2013"," Bland, boring, destroyed The Matrix
","Before I start, I just want to give a quick opinion of the first two Matrix films. The Matrix is amazing. Great story, characters I care about, amazing action sequences, just one of my favorite films. The Matrix Reloaded is decent but not great. It got the action right, but to me, the dialog scenes just made me bored. There were too many unnecessary scenes, like Neo and Trinity getting it on. Even some of the action wasn't that great. The ending of the Agent Smith battle was laughable. <br/><br/>But, for the main event, we're gonna dig into the great pile of dung that is The Matrix Revolutions. I did not like this one. The dialog scenes were even worse than Reloaded and the whole battle of Zion was terribly edited. I don't care about how they save Zion. I care about how Neo is going to destroy the Matrix! The one thing i liked about this movie, and that remained consistent throughout the trilogy, was Agent Smith. Hugo Weaving played the character perfectly and, unlike Kenau Reeves, was actually consistent in his portrayal. What I mean is, Kenau Reeves, let's face it, isn't a terribly good actor. He suffers from something I call BAS, or Ben Affleck Syndrome. Ben Affleck in Gigli, Surviving Christmas and Phantoms is a horrible actor. However, Ben Affleck in The Town, Argo and Good Will Hunting, is mediocre at best. It's the same with Kenau Reeves. Kenau Reeves in Generation Um, Johnny Mnenomic and this movie is a bad actor. However, Kenau Reeves in Point Break, Constantine and The Matrix is a mediocre actor. The best moment in this film is the end fight with Neo and Agent Smith. But, because the producers had used their ingenious ideas for fights in the other Matrix films, they decided to rip off Dragon Ball Z. Well done. This movie is scored beautifully once again, but anything with the track Neodammerung on it is epic.<br/><br/>So, in my opinion, The Matrix Revolutions is one of the worst films I have ever seen in the history of my watching of film ever! The characters are bland, The Zion battle makes me reach for the fast- forward button and I only watch this movie whenever I'm doing a Matrix- A-Thon. Do not check this out!"

","After first seeing Revolutions on a midnight opening show a decade back in 2003, I fired it up on a streaming service to see how it has aged. I remember being really disappointed the first time I saw the movie. But not as disappointed as I was after seeing Reloaded. While the second movie in the trilogy was a borefest let down I'll never forget, Revolutions packs the bigger surprise. Watching this a second time after a decade, boy was I blown away, I was tired and I didn't even remember what movie I had started watching once it was all over.<br/><br/>It's awful. Reoladed is merely bad. Mediocre to the point of obsolescence. But this is offensively awful. Revolutions isn't even interesting enough to make me sick, to paraphrase Cher from The Witches of Eastwick. I'd go so far to say Revolutions is also unfortunately and massively influential. Everything wrong with all recent action movies you can trace to this train wreck. <br/><br/>Endless BAD computer graphics? They're all here. Revolutions wasn't the first movie to assault the viewer with so much nonsense computer fakery, but it definitely did it on the largest scale. In the CGI fights, NEO and Smith posses the human likeness of a Stretch Armstrong doll. Don't blame the technology because in 2003, there weren't any excuses. <br/><br/>Worst part of Man of Steel, Transformers and Avengers? You know the skyscraper tear-down fist fights. Yeah they took it all from Revolutions and it was just as boring.<br/><br/>Avatar mechs? Yeah they stole those from here. Which stole them from an endless line of comic books. And yeah, they're boring. <br/><br/>Jesus symbology. Yawn. So bad. <br/><br/>I never laughed so hard seeing so much lead expended from firearms and only one or two bullets ever hitting anybody. You know I'm a huge John Woo fan but Yun-Fat is a much better marksman than all the pseudo firearm Jedis in this stinker.<br/><br/>If there is any movie with worse dialog this side of Troll 2, than Revolutions, it hasn't been made yet. The writing is among the worst - or best - examples of Deus Ex Machina. Nothing is motivated from action or character. Stuff in the movie happens just because. There is truly about 10 minutes of actual movie here. Watching Revolutions I could not stop thinking about the all too obvious Futurama parody, ""The Day the Earth Stood Stupid."" Fry finishes the episode victorious by locking the squid-like brains away in a ""A crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors.""<br/><br/>Fry's explanation is the best description of this terrible train wreck of a production you'll ever find. <br/><br/>Battleship Earth has nothing on this"

","the matrix trilogy for me is one of the greatest trilogies ever. however, i do think they should have worked on the follow ups to the 1999 matrix more slowly to increase the quality. nevertheless, relative to other movies, this is still close to the top.<br/><br/>i didn't enjoy the action as much in this movie as i did in the first 2 matrix films. but then it occurred to me: the action in revolutions is mostly in the real world, and throughout the trilogy we've been told that the dream world is fun (in a way), and the real world is hard and painful. so in that sense it made sense and then i thought it was really smart in a way. but ill take the beauty of flying to different planets in star wars any day over the gloominess of zion and the real world. the action was groundbreaking for its time regardless.<br/><br/>wat was not cool was the rehashing of old action ideas like the lobby shootout from the first. i expect better from the wachowskis.<br/><br/>it was also sortve annoying hearing the characters say some things over again which have already been said in the other matrix movies. its a bit of a dread but then again u can kinda tell thats wat the directors were going for. perhaps they ran out of ideas, but i doubt it.<br/><br/>another thing i did was add up the amount of time dedicated to action, and revolutions has the most. this is a bad thing! action is obviously easier to do then trying to tell an original story.<br/><br/>there wasn't too much character development for some of the players in this flick. however, if you contrast some of the characters from the first movies, they've really changed!<br/><br/>there's definitely lots of cool, original moments in this movie, and i even cried at one point! i enjoyed the last part of this movie, but i wish they wouldve had a longer ending. if your going to fully understand this movie, u need to read lots of books, or do lots of research into this movie. the directors included lots of stuff on purpose. even if ur an average person, you'll still get the basic story to one level or another. when i became an activist the matrix took on a different meaning for me, and i do not believe a lot of wat the wachoskis included in it was by accident. i think it has a great meaning for our world. all u gotta do is swap some characters with different classes of people in real life and all of a sudden there's not too much difference. but at the same time, if your not an intellectual, u will be scratching your head wondering wats the importance of some of the things in this film.<br/><br/>the cinematography is top notch. some of the music is great, and the rest is good. actually the music was ahead of its time (for north Americans anyways). some of the music is clearly a mix of computer and traditional instruments so even that adds to the theme of man and machine. the sound is great but not star wars quality. the acting is average or above average.<br/><br/>so go watch this movie. watch it over and over again, and think about it when your not watching it. cuz its deep and its a lot better than most other stuff out of Hollywood. it was ahead of its time in many ways. don't expect it to be better than the original matrix tho."

","The last part of The Matrix Trilogy is something of a letdown, sort of a climax that got postponed for too long, thus limiting viewers satisfaction. It is clear that the good guys will win, but we knew that at the moment when the production of The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions has been announced.<br/><br/>And as the experience teaches us, the only way to top a blockbuster is to invest more in special effects. Thus we get a firework of action, with a story which still holds. However, at a certain point the receptors get overstimulated and effects seem to be introduced for their own sake. Also, some sequences looked like intro for PC games of the era. CGI animation hasn't been as mature as today, yet that was not a valid excuse."

Lennix and Harold Perrineau.Once more Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and the evil Agent Smith returns, and the epic battle for control of Zion and the human race concludes in this explosive finale of the Matrix Trilogy.<br/><br/>Neo remains unconscious in the real world, caught in a mysterious subway station that lies between the machine world and the Matrix, and Bane is still a conduit for Agent Smith, who continues to grow out of control, threatening to destroy both worlds. Meanwhile, as the sentinels get closer and closer to Zion, the citizens of the earth's last inhabited city prepare for the inevitable onslaught. By bargaining with The Merovingian, Trinity and Morpheus are able to free Neo who, after meeting with The Oracle, decides that he must leave Zion and head for the machine mainframe. As Neo and Trinity venture into the dangerous machine world, with hopes of stopping both the machines and Agent Smith, their comrades in Zion attempt to fight off the attacking sentinels with the odds stacked greatly against them. <br/><br/>The last film of the Matrix Trilogy is disappointing conclusion due to the fact that the characters and ideas take a back seat to the special effects.This final installment is both too much of a good thing and too little.The Wachowski brothers have rendered their chronicles into banality, as if trying to imitate the qualitative tailspin of the Star Wars series.As an action movie, it's talky and consists of heavy violence but has a weaker script compared to its predecessors.But what really makes this film ordinary is that there's nothing even resembling a surprise.Too bad that one of the most original concepts in recent fantasy movie history has devolved into something weak in the conclusion of the trilogy.In the end,this final film does not elevate the franchise but only becomes a weak addition to it."

","I thought the first film was killer, and the second had a lot of promise, but this is the weakest of the three films, and proof that The Matrix was never really meant to be a trilogy. I'm sure that the brothers (I think they're actually brother and sister now) had ideas for films past the first one, but two sequels was really just wishful thinking. The ending sucked...It reminded me of the Abyss. What a monumental disappointment.<br/><br/>There's some nice moments during the Zion siege, but no genuine holy sh*t moments like the Morpheus Rescue or the Freeway Chase.<br/><br/>Going back a little bit to the second film, though...Where the hell did the guys who made Bound and The Matrix go? Because Reloaded and Revolutions didn't LOOK like they were directed by the same personnel."

","The last and final Wachowski's piece of the Matrix trilogy. It doesn't get as low as feared, but actually keeps the same level as in the previous movie. The story lacks in creativity and nothing new is added. Clearly, a movie to meet schedule. Fortunately, it had a great first movie, otherwise, I'd find it unbelievable how it reached this sort of budget. I'm gonna tell you exactly the same as in Reloaded, do not watch it, unless you really liked the first of the sequel, and the second one met your expectations. Commenting on the whole trilogy after watching all the three movies is quite hard, being there a big contrast between the first and both following it. Anyway, the way the Wachowski brothers mixed the substantial ideas with a mere action movie is impressing, and that mustn't be devalued. That is undoubtedly the thing with Matrix, though plots alone don't make movies, or good movies at least. Therefore, 5/10 for the movie, 7/10 for the sequel."
"gamebalance","10","1","2","8 December 2010"," Wow, I didn't know it was awesome
","Back then in 2003 I thought the movie was horrible. Not solid and stupid pointless plot. The stupid ending. But then some years later my knowledge of the things used in the movie raised. Mostly because I had to deal with psychology to solve my issues. And what a surprise! Some friend told me that names of the people on the Mobil Aven station has some hindu mythology meanings. Like - Sati symbolizes justice, love and sacrifice. This intrigued me a lot and I decided to read some information about mythology and such used in the movie. The effect was amazing. The movie began to has meaning and that meaning was like something unreachable by conscious. I also was amazed by the beginning of the Matrix Revolutions. Back then it was just a computer effect but last time it had a point! It has something like Dao idea, it has a holographic reality idea. Whole mirrored in particles and particles mirrored in whole. It has fractals. It has psychedelic perception. Wow, back then I would give it 3/10 now I excuse and give 10/10. People read what stands behind all of it - mythology,archetypes,transpersonal psychology researches,religions,quotes from comics and computer games. Without this knowledge it seems just impossible to understand/feel what is going on. The movie is amazing. Whole trilogy is amazing!"
"codydennis13","9","1","2","6 November 2009"," A Phenomenal Conclusion for The Philosophically Astute
","This was the perfect conclusion to the trilogy, and I do believe it should have been a trilogy. The first movie set more as an introduction to the second and third films, which held the true story. While I won't ruin the ending, I will say that it does make sense if you can understand the technological philosophy behind the stories. It also has an incredible amount dealing with determinism and causality.<br/><br/>For those who don't understand these concepts, this movie will probably be a complete mind-freak. But for those who actually take the time to understand the universe and the philosophy of the universe, this movie will bring the entire series to new heights.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't have near the same amount of fighting as the last two, but there doesn't really need to be. This movie needed closure, and that's what was given. And, I believe, it was given rather greatly.<br/><br/>As a final note, the musical score in this was phenomenal.<br/><br/>For those who just want violence, this movie won't be as satisfying, but for those who want a story, and a great one, this movie is a great conclusion and sets the series in gold."
"lopcar1993","6","1","2","29 September 2009"," Not as good and ending as it could have been, but good none the less
","Let me start off by saying I was disappointed in this film and overjoyed at the same time, why was overjoyed? Well because the Matrix: Revolutions answers allot of questions left in the second film. why was I disappointed? Well this film was a let down on a major scale it didn't feel like an ending to a great series it felt more like the season finale to a T.V. series, we'd see more of it next season and that didn't feel right to me, If they had given you more than just saying, "" Here you go! A half baked finale With a WTF ending and nothing to explain what happened afterward's."" That's what I felt The Wachowski brother's were saying to us loyal Matrix fans. They left us nothing in the end but the Matrix Revolutions. The half baked, exceedingly brilliant but ultimately flawed finale to The Matrix series.<br/><br/>Was this a terrible movie? No, was it a great finale? Some would say so but I'd have to say it borders but this movie is not a bad ending to one of cinema's most complex and intriguing film series. But it leaves nothing to the imagination by this installment we've seen it all all the wire fu , all the philosophical meanings and all the preachy telling's of the war's end and Zion's victory. But is it that that makes this movie an alright finale Instead of an amazing one? Yes. Because Matrix fans have seen it twice already, by this time it's nothing new or anything cool anymore it's just the same stuff done over again. But don't get me wrong I didn't hate this movie I really liked it I'm just disappointed there wasn't more. Disappointed that they ended it without no further explanation of Zion of the machines of NEO. It just left you hanging in the wind. The Wachowski brothers did gives us one wild and fun filled ride along the the way with the first two films and I think if you agree with me this one does the same as the first two. But again what it lacks is the eye popping grandeur and mythological sense the first two films, the first in particular, had it gives you a great sense of justice and moral strength but it falls short on the passion it had instead it's lack luster attempt is very cool and stylish but nothing to go ga-ga over.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves( who did well here.) pulls an ace out of his sleeve and again makes this third installment, much like the second, bearable to watch. Hugo Weaving does great with his lines and serves up a good third round as Smith, Fishburne does much better than he did in the second, not by much, but better none the less. Carrie-Anne Moss looks tired and unattractive in this time around(as she did in the second.) she also is again the downside in this third installment, just like the second, she drags along so badly that it's not even funny to watch her talk. Monica Bellucci is a major high point tin this film, as she was in the second she gives it it's worth and a little more strength. Although not in the film much her time on screen is very enchanting. But all in all the cast, most of them, made this film a pretty good third installment.<br/><br/>The things you got in the first two movies are not all present in the Matrix: Revolutions. The theme is very much the same, that's in this one. The story is very consistent and connects well with the first two. It doesn't have the same energy that the first two did. But what it does have is great popcorn entertainment style and class. It doesn't quite soar above that but it does come pretty close so is The Matrix: Revolutions a terrible film? No, it's it great fun to watch over and over again? Heck Yeah!! This film is not bad entertainment, it's not great entertainment, but it's not bad. Id' have to call it good entertainment it's a film you can come out of and say, ""Hey that wasn't half bad."" So I'd say it's worth the look and the time. But it's nothing special.<br/><br/>All in all Revolutions falls short of the The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded but it does soar above the average film and there is where the secret of it's success lies. This film will give you a great time, nothing mind blowing but a great time none the less. All in all The Matrix: Revolutions is not half bad."
"Fred_Maxwell","9","1","2","9 September 2009"," One of the GREATEST works of art in History!
","The Matrix Trilogy is, without a doubt, one of the greatest works of art in the history of mankind. Some discount this because they were movies, and not works of literature or music or ""traditional"" art (i.e. painting, sculpture, etc.). Others discount this claim because the trilogy was science fiction and not drama. Yet I claim that the Matrix Trilogy should be held alongside the works of Shakespeare and DaVinci and Michelangelo! The Matrix Trilogy contains all the best of the literary, the musical, the visual, the comedy, the tragedy, the mystery, and the anything-else-you-want-to-include-here. For those who didn't ""get"" the last two films, I am sorry to inform you that you simply should have stayed awake in your philosophy and comparative relgion classes in college. In this masterpiece you have the distilled philosophical wisdom of Descartes, Nietzsche, Baudrillard, Schoepenhoer, Plato, and many others along with the religious insights found in Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity. The Matrix Trilogy could be watched a THOUSAND TIMES and would still reveal more truths and mysteries with each successive viewing. My answer to those who try and compare the first film to the last two would be two-fold: First, view the Trilogy as a WHOLE, and not as three separate films. Only then will you realize that the answers to questions posed in the first film were not answered there, but rather, in the two subsequent films. Second, if you are not up on your philosophy (shame on you for getting that USELESS and BOURGEOIS business degree), then go out and buy one of the three main books EXPLAINING the many meanings of the films (""The Matrix and Philosophy"", ""More Matrix and Philosophy"", ""Taking the Red Pill"", etc.) If all you are seeing are the special effects and the gunplay, then you truly ARE trapped in a Matrix. It's called IGNORANCE! Educate yourself that you might enjoy life more fully! WAY TO GO WACHOWSKI BROTHERS!"
"jupiterjermaine","9","1","2","22 June 2009"," U all need to lighten up!
","For all of u who hate anything about any of the Matrix movies, I would like to suggest changing your perspective. I feel that u should view the Matrix movies as one story (like Star Wars). With that perspective, things make sense and is logical (movie logic though). If u knit-pick and add up all of the inconsistencies and plot-holes, of course u're gonna be annoyed and critical. But first of all it's A MOVIE! A sci-fi/action movie. And what's the main purpose of movies? To entertain! Second of all, this particular movie was part spiritual and part sci-fi/action. This means the Wachowski bros. had the challenge of balancing the two. If it had been all sci-fi, then u all would've been like ""it was just a special fx movie with no depth"". But if it had've been all spiritual, u would've been like ""this might as well been the Passion or something"". So it had to balance both. Of course there were things that were inconsistent and illogical but in the movie-world, who cares! As long as u are first entertained and second, mentally stimulated, the job of the movie is done. I didn't think Trinity's last words were too long or boring or unnecessary. I thought what she said was justified. I'm fine with Neo sacrificing himself at the end (that went in-line with the story). He had to die. His whole purpose was served and to keep him alive wouldn't have made since. Trinity's whole purpose was to support Neo and she did, so her death was in-line with the story also. Neo and Smith was the same but with polar opposites, so Neo was the only way to destroy Smith, that too was in-line with the story. I personally think the fight scenes with Neo and Smith should have been shorter and way more visually stimulating. For example, Neo (and Smith) can dodge bullets, fly, resuscitate hearts, pull bullets out of people, make bullets freeze in mid-air, and throw punches at mind-blowing speeds. So to me their fight should've taken advantage of these abilities instead of just water explosions. But that's my only gripe. At the end of the day, I'm pleased with the whole trilogy and I think it's imperfectly perfect and one of my favorite movie trilogies of all time!"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","1","2","11 April 2009"," Takes the rest of the step off the edge
","I base this upon the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. An appropriate question to ask would be ""where did it go wrong?"". The first left little, if anything, to be desired. Already with the second it got worse, and this just does not work. Such a waste of potential. The dialog ranges, but it's too often simply not believable, or incredibly corny. This also has an abundance of cheese. The clichés are all over the place, with situations we've seen countless times before in typical mainstream pap. The plot isn't all bad, however, it spends so much time on characters that aren't fleshed out enough for us to care about them(and The Kid is downright intolerable in this). There are scenes that don't feel like they have a point. The effects are still almost invariably excellent, but more than ever before in the series, it feels like they were put there for no other reason than that they looked so great, to put something cool in, because the Wachowskis could, and without being well-integrated. The cinematography isn't as impressive. The editing is fine, but several things go on for too long. There is still philosophy, still ideas, still themes and symbolism. These, sadly, come off as being pretentious, like in Reloaded, and here they even take over, rendering this meaningless if you do not interpret it, and while that also somewhat rings true for the second one, the first one, whilst it would make it have considerably less impact on the viewer, could be enjoyed as nothing beyond another version of the old popular conflict between good and evil. This can't decide if it wants to be accessible and mere popcorn-flick fun, or smart and providing food for thought, and ends up failing to be acceptable as either. The acting ranges. The music is well-done. There is sensuality and definitely material in that realm, a fair amount of harsh language, and some quite bloody violence. This also comes with a text introduction(by the brothers, the same one as on the other two) for the commentary tracks(well worth listening to). One of philosophers, Dr. Cornel West(and yes, if his voice sounds familiar, he does, in fact, have a part in both sequels, as one of the councillors) & Ken Wilder, who like the three films, and one of critics, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson, who were less positive. The double-DVD holds artwork, a time-line, and a couple of featurettes. I recommend this to those who want the whole franchise, at least the efforts that were put up on the silver screen, and/or those who are mainly interested in the concepts and thoughts explored in these. 7/10"

","I have to say that I absolutely loved the Matrix 1 & 2. So I bought the DVD for this since I have a Home Theatre system at home.I turned off the lights and played the film.I did this after breakfast so I should be active right?<br/><br/>The film started and I was astonished until Oracle turned to Smith. The machine versus Zion fight was seriously the most boring part that I needed to fight just to stay awake. And not enough Neo! When the war started, I felt like I was watching another non-Matrix Movie. They were barely in the Matrix other than the start and the climax. Well the climax was the saving grace in this movie. And dude, where is Morpheus.Was he even in the movie? I saw him talking but wha?wha?wha?wha?wha? WHAT IS HE DOING? HE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING. You could get the beginning and the end of this movie put it together put neo's face in the middle and it would get a higher rating. I think they should have shown Neo and trinity in between the Machine vs. Zion battle because It felt he wasn't there. Even smith we see him turn the Oracle into him then what ....<br/><br/>WE SEE HIM AT THE END OF THE MOVIE?!?!?!? That's it the war completely ruined this movie.

"sme_no_densetsu","7","1","2","14 December 2008"," The Matrix trilogy ends on a disappointing note
","""The Matrix Revolutions"" is the third film in the Matrix trilogy. Picking up where the second film left off, this one is split between two separate attempts to repel the machine army: one spear-headed by Commander Lock and the other led by Neo.<br/><br/>Much of what can be said about this film is a continuation of the criticisms levelled at the second film in the trilogy. Once again the visuals are top-notch but they are of little consequence in a film that gets bogged down in philosophy and trying to top the effects of the previous films.<br/><br/>The cast is basically the same as in the previous film so you should know exactly what to expect there. However, the part of the Oracle had to be re-cast because Gloria Foster passed away while the previous film was still shooting. The screenwriters wrote this change into the script but I didn't quite buy it.<br/><br/>The Wachowski's can't be faulted for the look of the film as it upholds the high standard set by ""The Matrix Reloaded"". The music is once again above average and fitting for the material as well. However, the film is little more than an attractive package with disappointing contents.<br/><br/>I wouldn't necessarily say that the second & third Matrix films ought to be ignored but there's no question that they represent a noticeable drop in quality from the first film. They're still above-average action flicks but they don't come close to capturing the magic of the original."

","i found this concluding chapter of The Matrix trilogy much better than the second installment and probably better than the first one.this one was more coherent and made more sense story wise.plus there aren't as many drawn out repetitive,and absurd fight scenes.this movie is actually pretty exciting,particularly during the showdown between Zion and the sentinels.but this movie,like the other two,borrows heavily from other sources,most notably the Alien franchise,and the biblical parallel is once again very strong.there are some logic gaps,and things that don't make sense,but at least the story wasn't as muddled.to me,this was the most satisfying of the trilogy.for me,The Matrix Revolutions is a 7/10"
"view_and_review","6","1","2","31 January 2007"," This is the ending we were waiting for?
","Definitely the worst of the three. Part of the reason may be the fact that there was so much anticipation due to the large success of the Matrix and the plethora of questions and uncertainties raised by ""The Matrix Reloaded."" The other reason ""The Matrix Revolutions"" was the worst of the three was that it just wasn't that good.<br/><br/>The movie did provide some drama, some tense moments, and a lot of anticipation as to what would happen in the end. But after the ending I felt like I had to watch hours of filler just to get to a bogus ending. Sentinels were all over the place, either being shot at or ran from, Smith was replicating himself left and right, and the entire time we're trying to figure out what Neo would do to save humankind. <br/><br/>The Neo fight scenes were quelled (thankfully) to try to add more meaningful dialog and symbolism. They only succeeded in adding gibberish and confusion, although not as much gibberish as ""Reloaded"". And the ending? Was that ending supposed to be satisfying? Was that ending supposed to bring solace or happiness? They left the whole feud wide open and not much better than before. Sure there is a truce between Zion and the machines for the time being, but like the Oracle asked the Architect, ""how long will the truce last?"" Is it too much to ask to have humans on the top of the food chain again? <br/><br/>After three movies and about six hours of viewing we find out that Neo dies, Trinity dies, Zion will survive in its deplorable state (if at least temporarily), and the Matrix will continue to thrive on human batteries. I guess the lesson is: Life ain't fair."
"Goettschwan","3","1","2","20 January 2007"," Well, if that's it
","23 minutes into the movie (of which I expected nothing much more than a climax on all planes to the three movies) we've got a lost plot getting back on it's rails, scores of incredibly bad lines remarkably similar in niveau to the new star wars parts and perfectly reminiscent of a bad action movie à la lundgren or seagal, an overdose of special effects unnecessarily cut into stroboscopic sequences, silly gun battles worth of a budget first person shooter, and worst of all : the coolness of the characters portrayed so well in the first part is so unbelievable they remind me of hiphopgangsta-wannabees in the streets. Everything in me screams for fast forward, but I suppose I've got to sit through it. Hindsight is probably better: The acting of Keanu Reeves reminds me of ""Johnny Mnemonic"", which is,well, not on my hit list at all. The only real highlight is Hugo Weavings masterclass bad-guy acting and it is far and few in between. Monica Belluci obviously was casted for her, er, looks. The Music score is discussable, and in some parts I do not at all agree with their underlining of the film, especially the pathos for some really unnecessary lines and scenes. The ongoing plot is predictable and in between bad lines nothing astonishing happens. I'd go as far as to say that some scenes are capable of starring in Plan 9 from outer space, line-wise. The movie seems to be overtly ""inspired"" from a whole score of other movies, same genre or not. May this be a homage to better movies. All in all they set out to revolutionize films with the Matrix trilogy, but IMHO just the first would have done just right for that, part two and especially three don't really live up to the bar set. The Wachowski brothers showed that they can write good movie adaptions with ""V for Vendetta"", but here they just leave space for wishful thinking."

This has nothing in common but the names of two of the characters.<br/><br/>There is no characterisation. The special effects look cartoonish.

Instead we got a mixture of product placement for Toys R' Us and every war cliché discarded from better movies.<br/><br/>The irony of 'reality' being the weakest part of the narrative was apt, but seemed unintended as the unlikeable Zion (which, like Heaven or Utopia, should never have been so fully revealed)battled endless machines whilst the audience battled seemingly endless boredom.<br/><br/>If The Matrix was a movie of the mind, this was simply a movie of the wallet. And like 'bought' wisdom it too rang hollow in both head and heart."
"BigWhiskers","1","1","2","27 September 2006"," Reloaded Pt2 or How I Made A Bad Sequel.
","After having watched this mess ,I can only come to one conclusion.Really Bad.The first Matrix was original and had all the wonder and action you love. Matrix Reloaded had some amazing special effects and lots of action ,maybe a bit too busy but it still worked. This movie had none of the wonder or amazement, most of the action was minimal and the dialog wooden. The climatic fights that were over-hyped during production as exciting and action packed were total borefests ,NEO VS SMITH was the most lame fight in the movie- all they did was fly around and spout bad dialog ,the battle involving humans and machines in Zion was nothing more than repetitive shots of the same man in a robot exoskeleton firing machine guns at the same snakelike machines with people on the ground firing the same rockets over and over- can you say Snorefest.<br/><br/>My take on the whole overblown mess of Matrix Revolutions, since the action picks up exactly at the point where Reloaded left off,it looks more like a continuation of the second movie than the beginning of a third. If you've ever watched Star Wars,Lord Of The Rings or even Harry Potter, none of those films ever shot a sequel that takes place the very second where the previous movie left off. I think they got greedy,wanted to get this series wrapped up,take a vacation and spend our money before we realized we'd be shortchanged a real movie.This movie should be put in the fireplace and someone else take the reins and make a decent sequel. The ending of Revolutions leaves the door open for one so why not. See you at the movies"
"nmarkos","10","1","2","18 July 2006"," Good and Evil. The necessary illusions ...
","The movie ""Matrix"" has shown what every true spiritual teaching reveals: The experience of good and evil applies only on the world of the relative. And they are the necessary illusions for the world of the relative to exist. And the world of the relative (of separation) is necessary to exist so we can have an experiential knowledge of life and not just conceptual.<br/><br/>One thing that seems very difficult and tricky to be clearly presented in a story is that evil is not really outside of one's self. But more and more stories nowadays show that good and evil co-exist inside us. ""Matrix"" shows that very nicely by placing the character of the ""Oracle"" as part of the Machine (evil) and another trilogy movie ""The Lord of the Rings"" showed that too by repeatedly presenting the hero of the movie to be tempted to possess the immense power of the magic ring.<br/><br/>Even if it was possible to exist a moment that evil would absolutely dominate over good, on that same moment evil would be transformed into good. ""Matrix Revolutions"" very nicely portrayed that in the end which seems that it has confused many ...<br/><br/>... and it confused many because the concept of the relationship of opposites has not been made very clear by philosophy or religion. However, great teachers and spiritual masters such Buddha, Mohammad, Christ (and others less known) have made these concepts very clear but ... we like the drama too much, and that's why we haven't heard them...<br/><br/>But even books like ""Conversations with God"", ""A Course in Miracles"", ""The Urantia Book"" and many many others (if one looks will find plenty) set the record straight ... reading such books makes movies like the ""Matrix"" to make more sense ...<br/><br/>And to paraphrase Rumi: Beyond ideas of good and evil there is a field. I'll meet you meet there ... when you choose ..."

","One of the things that they kept parroting about this movie was ""Tonight, this war ends"". One keeps wondering about how the writers are going to get that to happen? A brilliant twist? No, it was something that was pretty inconceivable - Peace with the machines. I still cant figure out if that was a result of having no ideas or an idea that no one would expect it?<br/><br/>This part also fails to explain some of the funky stuff that happens in Reloaded. The reason given for how Neo stopped the sentinels with his hand was extremely stupid and obviously got no attention at all. Overall, the explanations are either dumb or evaded.<br/><br/>However, with top notch special effects and action in the real world as good as those within the Matrix, this movie comes out on top. The defence of Zion was really amazing and can also be satisfactory or done justice if seen in the theatre. Oh and they did ripoff Dragonball Z!"

","All cod-philosophy and pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo, wrapped up in a tasty CGI coating, the third installment from the Wachowski's does nothing to make sense of what went before and adds further confusion with its incomprehensible script.<br/><br/>Technically, however, this movie is about as good as they get. The special effects are simply breath-taking  Matrix Revolutions looks fantastic and is worth watching for the visuals alone! The ending  well, I wish I could say it wrapped the trilogy up in a satisfactory manner, but I really can't. In fact, I wish I could say I knew what the hell was going on in the last two Matrix films, but I can't do that either. Still, they looked good. I did mention that, didn't I?"
"mhajs","10","1","2","12 January 2006"," Why Revolutions IS a great movie!
","**** out of ****<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions is the final chapter in the saga created by the Wachowski brothers and I must say I am very happy by being completely satisfied by watching it.<br/><br/>While the previous two movies relied more inside the virtual ""matrix"" world, the third installment takes place almost all the time at the real world. Good? Bad? No. Not even close. It's perfect! There aren't too much fight scenes in this movie, this time it's more like a war between the machines and the Zion defense army. How this was done was masterfully done, by letting us see the sentinels invading the docks, characters showing differences of opinions about how they should defend the city, and the best of all: Neo returning to the source.<br/><br/>For many, this may feel to much like a fantasy story, but you have to see that the matrix movies are a fantasy story. By imagining a futuristic world where the horizon is fully populated by robotic buildings, dark lightning-striking skies, an underground city and a virtual world where you defy the rules and laws of physics, Larry and Andy really created such a fantastic sci-fi trilogy.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be the same if this movie had been done the same way as the other two... it had to innovate, to show something different, to focus on what hasn't been yet and all the events in it: the death of Neo and Trinity, Neo returning to the source, the machines and humans peace agreement, the conversation between the oracle and the architect, the defeat of Agent Smith, everything was great! The ending might have lacked something, but still, this is my all-time favorite sci-fi trilogy."
"DarqFall","10","1","2","9 November 2005"," Understanding the movie
","I think you should see this movie deeper because behind every scene a philosophical motive is hidden. (Deeper means at least 3 times :) )<br/><br/>(My English isn't very good, and the quotes are from memory) So what you must see in the first place is that Matrix is a very philosophical movie and many of the events in this movie have just philosophical reasons.<br/><br/>Why did the agent Smith died in the end after killing Neo? That's Simple. Agent Smith says ""Cause without purpose we would not exist"". ""Purpose of life is to end"","" I'm here because of you"" etc. Smith is a program that without a purpose he would not exist, his purpose was to kill neo and everything else. After he reaches his purpose he dies because he had no other reason to exist.<br/><br/>Who is actually Smith? The Oracle gives the answer in a very philosophical way. ""He is you, you're opposite, the equation trying to balance itself"" It is clear that the Matrix was a much more complex program simulating even basic rules of the Universe. Neo and Smith are just a ""coincidentia oppositorum""( Yin-Yang philosophy that says that white exists because of black and black exists because of white and they both exists because the balance of two sides gives more stability in equilibrium than the balance of nothing) This is too an answer at the previous question. Cause without white, black would not exist.<br/><br/>Why Neo has this name? Neo means new, usually a prefix put on new ages ex: Neolithic. <br/><br/>Who is actually Neo? In the first and almost the entirely second movie Neo is just a human. The agents say that before Neo meets the FOM ""Is him. The ANOMALY. Do we proceed? Yes, He's still... ONLY HUMAN. "" So Neo is a 100% human anomaly but which is foreseen and so controlled by the ""path of the one"".(This is a powerful philosophy about fate). I'm almost sure even though I don't have an argument that the others five "" the one"" were different humans with different names (I'm not 100% sure). Neo looses his 100% humanity after the meeting with the FOM, because at that meeting a code is enhanced in him. In the third film someone uses the expression ""the code he's carrying"".<br/><br/>Why Zion has this name? See the Bible (The city of Sion) Why is Zion build by machines? Another method of control.<br/><br/>Why is Zion going to be destroyed? The principle of purifying by reborn. The anomaly is a sign that things have gone too far, the anomaly itself being an error that couldn't be controlled. <br/><br/>And there are so many things that can be explained that I could write a book. And there are still things that I don't understand. The movie also puts in evidence the philosophy of choice (Neo), purpose (Smith), reason (Merovingian), control (FAM), fate (Oracle which symbolize in many ways the Oracle from Delphi), truth and perceptions (Matrix), Yin-Yang (especially Neo and Smith) and many more..."

","it's the best end that a trilogy can have , i'm sorry cause of neo and i'm wondering if this story continues what kind of ""the one"" is gonna take his place ... for me is keanu reeves the best actor could ever do a role like that of neo. and after all what is gonna happen with the people of sion , they have no real life , it's not the kind of life they want , to get to the surface and see the sun -this is a freedom everyone want's . but the question i'll always have , why neo ............why Mr.Anderson !!!!! is he a program error ??? or what??!!! i'd like to see the matrix once again .....maybe in 5-10 years it's a saga that worthy to watch."
"abg0071","10","1","2","22 September 2005"," Understanding the ending is driving me crazy!
","MAJOR SPOILERS I have watched the trilogy over a dozen times, and Revolutions perhaps twice that. I understand what drives the characters, what makes them who they are, the complete how and why. What I don't understand is how NEO Defeats SMITH. So I will give you my opinion which is still has a few holes.<br/><br/>Smith knocks Neo to the ground. He then speaks of his vision of having seen this, ""this is the end, and I am supposed to say"" Now lets go back a step to the oracle who smith had taken control of, and what the Merlinjian said ""The eyes of the oracle can only be given, not taken"" Smith says ""Everything that has a beginning has and ending"" This was not Smith speaking to NEO but instead the Oracle telling him it is time to act. After The Smiths are Destroyed it is the oracles body that appears in the ditch where the final battle ended.<br/><br/>So the question that remains, how did Neo kill smith. And is Neo in fact Dead. I don't believe he is, I think that the Neo & The Oracle as a team with the Machine defeated Smith. Smith could not destroy Neo because Neo was un able to be destroyed in The Matrix, hence the first movie. Neo can also co exist in the Matrix and the real world, separate mind and body.<br/><br/>Now to another opinion. I believe Trinity & Neos love accompanied by what the Architect said in Reloaded about Neos love, compassion, and loyalty to the Human race, was the driving force behind his actions. The comment was made that he unlike the one's before him possessed this Love for another (Trinity) and that flaw would cause him not to return to the source. He could not sacrifice Trinity nor could he allow the entire human race both inside and outside of the Matrix be destroyed, according to the Architect if he did not return to the source then all would be lost and an alternate means of survival for the MAchines would have to be sought.<br/><br/>My opinion? Brilliant trilogy, but simply complex. All must be considered to develop an understanding. This puts a historic end to kill the bad guy and save the day shootem up movies that an infant could understand."

","After I had watched the whole trilogy for the second time, I've started to realize that there are too many holes, questions in the story and there are too many things being said between the lines. After some time of thinking about it I've came out with a new interpretation. (At least new for me.:) What if Neo was not a man? If hi is only a anomaly in the codes of the Matrix as the Architect said? And that is his true identity. And his true purpose is to bring people hope so they can sleep they endless dream in their tanks? Then - you would ask - how could he break into the real world? The world of Zion? The second film holds the answer. The same way as Smith did. Because Zion is a program too. A shelter for the restless souls, who can't fit in the Matrix. That is why the machines didn't destroy it after Neo killed Smith - the unwanted anomaly. The Matrix was restored and Zion could work as the shelter again. Nothing has changed except one thing. The people who wanted to leave the Matrix were free to go. Go to Zion, to another program. So this time only the Matrix was restarted not like in the last six periods. Nothing else has happened. People are dreaming. I can't see the happy end.:)"
"90025846","6","1","2","2 May 2005"," The Matrix Revolutions: Eye Candy or Bad Film-making?
","I believe this movie had LESS plot than a lot of others. The Matrix Revolutions is BAD film-making. It seems almost as if the special effects are there to take your attention away from the fact that Revolutions actually has 75% LESS plot than the other Matrix movies. The Matrix had a very intelligent and involving (if not somewhat confusing) plot, about blah blah choices, reality isn't real, humanity plugged into a computer program while robots live off our body heat. Even in Reloaded, not quite as engaging, but it was still there. But in Revolutions it was all like: Okay, there's robots coming to kill us all, and we're going to blast them with our robots, and they're still going to win, and some character (Link's wife Zee) who really wasn't important in Reloaded is suddenly going to play a major role, while some guy from the last movie is going to try to kill Neo 'cause he's really Smith, and then despite the fact that the machines don't make deals, Neo is going to save humanity by entering the Matrix and having a big CGI battle with ONE (count him, 1) Agent Smith, and smash through CGI buildings and create CGI shock waves with lots of CGI lightning. And how the hell does assimilating the Oracle give Smith the power to fly? Boo. The only reason I like this movie is because I'm a 17-year-old boy and I like watching the machines get blasted to bits and the kung-fu battle is cool."
"schmimic","8","1","2","1 May 2005"," The final chapter of the Matrix saga proves to be very confusing.
","Starring: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving This movie and Reloaded are actually really just one movie cut into two big pieces, so even if you didn't watch the first movie, you have to watch the second one for this one to make sense. I mean, Reloaded even ends with the words ""To be concluded"" flashing across the screen.<br/><br/>Revolutions picks up right where Reloaded left off, with Neo (Reeves) in a coma and Bane on the table next to him. At this point we don't know who Bane is, unless we paid REALLY close attention in Reloaded. I won't reveal his identity because I don't do reviews with spoilers.<br/><br/>So anyway, they got Neo to the source but the war is still going because he chose to save Trinity (Moss) instead of doing what he was supposed to do. Awwww, how sweet. But now he's stuck in some strange coma after stopping five sentinels in the real world just by holding out his hand. The thing about this coma though, is that his brain waves look like the brain waves of somebody who is connected to the matrix. How can that be, if he isn't plugged into anything? Hmmm Turns out he's in some sort of middle ground. He's at the train station, a middle ground between the program world and the matrix. He can't get out of it unless somebody comes and gets him though. And of course, the Merovingian is the one who has control over the train station. So Morpheus (Fishburne) and Trinity head out for a chat with Merv to get her man back. Then a quick stop over at the Oracle, who has changed her form, and back to the real world for some time to think. It's funny this is still a Matrix movie since very little of the movie is spent in the matrix.<br/><br/>After taking a little time to think, Neo comes to the conclusion that he has to take a ship to the machine city. He isn't sure why or what he can do when he gets there, but he just knows that's where he has to go. And he knows he probably won't be coming back. Obviously Trinity volunteers to go with him, and they take Naobi's ship out there. There is an encounter with Bane and his identity is revealed, but like I said, I'm not saying who he is.<br/><br/>Back in Zion, the machines are getting ever closer to their precious city and the time of their last stand is drawing near. Neo eventually gets to the machine city and is jacked into the matrix for one last final confrontation with Smith (Weaving) The rest you'll just have to see for yourself. Still a good movie, though not as good as the first or the second.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 3 out of 4 (worth watching)"
"Citizen_Cam","4","1","2","28 March 2005"," Much TOO deep.
","In my review of The Matrix Reloaded, I pointed out that, while a decent enough film, it was incomprehensible. Boy, did I speak too soon. All I can say is if you thought Reloaded was baffling, you ain't seen nothing yet. The movie follows on directly from the previous one, with the army of machines plummeting mercilessly toward the human resistance, and Neo (Reeves) still inside the computer world despite not being there. As the humans fight the machines, Neo wages his private war against the rogue Agent Smith (Weaving) who is now in control of the Matrix (or something like that, anyway). Thematically, I can translate it like this: Neo is the Messiah, and he's going to save both worlds. This involves balancing Yin and Yang, or balancing an equation, or something. Mostly it involves fisticuffs with Smith. I never thought I would say this about a film, but The Matrix Revolutions simply isn't shallow enough. It's too deep. It delves into themes so complex and so awesomely complex only the Wachowski Brothers (the people responsible) know what they're talking about. A little less meaning of life and a few more wacky, outrageous stunts, fights and special effects might have made it work more. Not that the film isn't watchable. The fight sequences are cool, and the battle against the machines is cool, and the special effects are cool<br/><br/><ul><li>everything is cool, pretty much. Cool, but not necessarily good. As always, it looks fantastic. But that's about all that's fantastic. The acting isn't really worth comment, mostly because there isn't much. What the Wachowskis need to learn is that you can be meaningful without being confusing, and you can be intelligent without being incomprehensible. The first Matrix was good because it combined kick-arse effects and stunts with a real statement, a powerful message about humanity and a good, solid storyline. The two that followed it blurred the line between message and plot that it's impossible to follow either. The sad part is, it really didn't need to be this way. It could have been excellent. Instead, it's a mess. Sorry, guys. You did well with the first film, but let's face it, you can only push a metaphor so far. Good-o-meter rating: 4/10</li></ul>"
"jimboduck","6","1","2","22 February 2005"," Worst one, of course - 6 (endurable)
","The best Matrix movie is the second one, Reloaded, in my opinion (probably a 10 in my book). Why? Because it seems as if most of the production resources were poured into that one. If you watch the very first Matrix again, you'll see that the clothing and hair styles are a cheap shadow of what they become in the second installment. Reloaded is black, slick, and restrained like a team of crouched ninja's surveying the Tokyo cityscape. Also, you can see that the production in other areas like editing, CGI, acting, and martial arts, jump up several notches from the first to second.<br/><br/>Where does that leave REVOLUTIONS, the third installment to the Matrix trilogy? Let's imagine those crouched ninja's again, except the sky opens up, and a junk-load of tubes and shiny cars are rained down on them for three hours. That's the idea: all the sleek cool feel of the movie is drowned out in a cranky CGI mess. Although there were some cool scenes here and there, basically the idea was: while the actors and main crew are working on Reloaded, let's just plow through the third installment with our CGI team and forget about all that real-life action stuff. What you get is a lot of flying widget things and bullets and war-rumble shouting from the Zion soldiers. That's fine, but when did a CGI project like that actually work? If you up 10 minutes of CGI distraction, that means that you lose 20 minutes of valuable story-time and probably derail the whole flow of the movie all together. I think they should have animated the entire REVOLUTIONS movie and released it through a separate production company. Then the audience would be asking themselves, how does this new production mesh with the Warchowski productions, rather than, how much worse is the Marchowski movie than the first two.<br/><br/>As there is too much machinery flying around, there is hardly any human action. All that first-rate martial arts that was featured in the first two movies become so watered down, that one is left thinking, did the actors get fed up with the workouts and decide to take a break on REVOLUTIONS? In fact, it would be worthwhile examining what the actors have to say about REVOLUTIONS. Most of what I heard are generalizations like love conquers all, or exciting machine-human war epic, or something like that. Probably what they want to say is, boy am I glad to take a rest for once!<br/><br/>Although REVOLUTIONS tidily wraps up the Matrix storyline cleverly, it's just too long and too busy. I would rather watch the entire Animatrix several times over before watching REVOLUTIONS any time soon.<br/><br/>JY<br/><br/>jimboduck-dot-com"

","By this third film the Wachowski brothers almost completely abandon the idea of The Matrix, not to mention the two stars who had led the first film (Neo and Trinity), and produce a black-oriented action flick set almost entirely in Zion. The result is a movie that is less irritatingly smug and confusing than The Matrix Reloaded, but also lacks any of the mind games that carried audiences through the first film and part of the second; it is now simply a Sci-Fi channel action movie with a bigger budget. If you care at all what happens to such fascinating characters as Morpheus, Niobe, Bane and Councillor West, well, here's your chance to watch them save the sweaty, bad-smelling Zion and keep it free for humorless black people.

","Prepare to be knocked out by final 'Matrix' <br/><br/>Glenn Lovell Mercury News Published: Wednesday, November 5, 2003 <br/><br/>''The Matrix Revolutions,'' the third and final chapter in the Wachowski Brothers' mainframe-messiah story, begins in medias res, a mere heartbeat after ''The Matrix Reloaded'' (Part 2) fizzled out with the tease ''To be concluded . . .'' Neo (Keanu Reeves) is in a coma, and his computer-generated self is stuck in an ethereal limbo between the machine world and the Matrix construct. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), abetted by Seraph, the Oracle's right-hand man, are sprinting to the rescue.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, what remains of humankind, hunkered down in the subterranean city of Zion, is a mere 20 hours from Armageddon. Knocking loudly at the dome are armies of robotic sentinels or ''squiddies.''<br/><br/>Confused? You won't be for long if you're a ''Matrix'' freak or even a passing fan. After a slow start -- spiked with more Zen-infused computerese and another S&M club shootout -- ''Revolutions'' finds its bearings and powers up as a three-way race: to save Zion, to return home in a Hovercraft, to penetrate the dark heart of Machine city. And the results are quite stunning, especially when the swarming sentinels break through and the battle for Zion begins in earnest.<br/><br/>It's a battle royal in every sense of the term. So be prepared to be knocked out and exhilarated. The Wachowskis' 3D computer-generated effects are state-of-the-art and then some, easily surpassing the latest ''Star Wars'' prequel or ''Terminator'' sequel. And for a change, the human element isn't lost amid the digital dust-ups. We fear for the good folk of Zion, identifying with them on a personal level.<br/><br/>Later, there's even a protracted death scene that will have the hard-core fans sobbing into their popcorn.<br/><br/>Some feat, eh, when you consider how unbelievably technical these stories are? In the end, ''Revolutions'' makes good on its creators' promise to fuse Kafka, ''Alice in Wonderland,'' the New Testament and ''The Wizard of Oz.''<br/><br/>To recap for those who have been vacationing on Mars these last four years: The Wachowskis' ''real world'' is a lie, a computer-generated matrix, a dream state for vegetating humans. The real real world is a blasted, sunless place run by super-bots who incubate and ''grow'' humans for heat energy.<br/><br/>Those who have escaped the pod fields live at the Earth's core, in Zion. Of this number, a handful of rebels, led by Morpheus, transport (by land line) from the real world to the Matrix, fighting FBI-like gatekeepers and recruiting newbies. Neo may be the prophesied One who will lead his people out of bondage, like a 22nd-century Moses, only in Ray-Bans and designer cassock.<br/><br/>The first ''Matrix'' -- easily the best in the trilogy -- laid out the parameters and laws of the Matrix (e.g. ''if you're killed there, you die here'') and pitted Neo against Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), an archenemy every bit as blah as his name. Part 2 wasn't so much ''reloaded'' as recycled: It alternated endless chases and shootouts with more quasi-religiosity that had Neo and us crossing our eyes, moaning, ''Say again?!''<br/><br/>Though not as provocative or original as the first installment, which pushed retro sci-fi through the Looking Glass, ''Revolutions'' is still an upgrade. This is probably because most of the heavy lifting insofar as the character dynamics has been done, and the Wachowskis can virtually surf to the finish, riding the crest of their story's momentum.<br/><br/>They certainly seem to have learned their lesson after the somewhat tepid response to ''Reloaded,'' which has the goofy, cornball tone of the first ''Superman.'' Now the mood is darker, more fatalistic, the stakes higher. And while Neo and ''Trin'' are front and center as their romance continues on a more spiritual plain, Morpheus -- suddenly without his beloved Nebuchadnezzar Hovercraft -- is supplanted by the very able Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), the gung-ho Mifune (Nathaniel Lees) and the hero-worshiping Kid (Clayton Watson) who, like the prototypical squirt, begs for his chance to carry the ball.<br/><br/>And Agent Smith, who last time replicated himself into a small army? He's now a rogue program -- copied a thousandfold! Smith's showdown with Neo is supposed to be the ultimate street brawl, and it certainly covers a lot of ground. But the real climax -- a mechanized Battle of Helms Deep -- falls earlier, as the tentacled squiddies pour into the domed city and are temporarily repulsed by blazing pom-pom guns."

"Li-1","Null","1","2","8 April 2004"," A thrilling conclusion, but still a huge miss on the wide opportunities given the premise.
","*** out of ****<br/><br/>As the concluding film of an epic saga, The Matrix Revolutions is certainly more satisfying and thrilling than the likes of, say, Return of the Jedi or Back to the Future Part III, but its accomplishments are almost entirely in the visual sense; this is a sensational action experience, complete with epic battle scenes and a showdown for the ages.  There's barely any focus on the Matrix this time around, but in my opinion, that's okay, the previous films have already squandered enough opportunities that I don't mind (and even actually prefer) the switch of attention to Zion and the war against the machines.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen the previous installments, good luck trying to catch up.  When we last left off in The Matrix Reloaded, Neo (Keanu Reeves) fell into a coma after displaying the surprising ability to destroy sentinels in the real world.  He's currently trapped in a place between the Matrix and reality, a squeaky clean subway station run by the uncouth trainman (Bruce Spence).<br/><br/>Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) team up with the Oracle's protector, Seraph, to rescue Neo.  Meanwhile, there are two burgeoning problems; an invasion force of 250,000 sentinels drilling their way into Zion and the ever multiplying Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who's quickly taking over the Matrix.  You can see where this is leading.<br/><br/>Much like Reloaded, most of Revolutions' glaring faults are in the first half.  There's slightly less philosophical babble this time around, but the constant questions and debates are as tiresome and silly as before. Returning is the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and his wife Persephone (Monica Bellucci), and while they're not saddled with the heavy-handed philosophy they were forced to utter in Reloaded, the minute screen time they're give suggests that the Wachowskis had no idea what to do with these characters.  I would have liked at least a mention of the Merovingians' thoughts on Smith's rapid multiplication, but we don't even get that much.<br/><br/>
Nearly as annoying is Neo's final meeting with the Oracle (this time played by Mary Alice, who's just as good as Gloria Foster was), where the answers that are revealed are purely anticlimactic.  Like most others, we all wondered why Neo had the power to destroy the sentinels; the answer makes no more sense than anything else the Oracle says.  Most frustrating of all is that the Oracle could easily have revealed to Neo all the information the Architect laid upon him, thus rendering most of Reloaded's running time and plot rather pointless, but instead gives some b.s. remark about how Neo wasn't ready to be told, but in typical ""Oracle-style"" fashion, gives the answer in a question form that has Neo responding to his own query in a lamely introspective manner.<br/><br/>As Revolutions' plot progresses, there are several hints and plot strands that intrigued and frustrated me.  The Oracle mentions that Smith is Neo's opposite, the result of the equation balancing itself.  I gather this implies that the five previous ""Ones"" had opponents similar to Smith, perhaps even Smith himself, as there is a line between him and Seraph that suggests at past rivalry (and led some to believe that Seraph was a previous One, not entirely an impossibility, given the color code he emanated in Reloaded, but not something I care to ruminate about at the moment). Unfortunately, it's merely a line that's never expanded on, we know little more than we did before.<br/><br/>For this installment alone, I would think the most wasted opportunity was in not displaying Smith's rapid multiplication.  By the end of the film, he's taken over the entire virtual world, imagine the chaos and terror the population must have experienced at the sight of a man constantly replicating himself through human hosts.  I can't believe the Wachowski brothers didn't see the gold mine they were standing on with this potentially terrific subplot, but like many other aspects of the series, they simply avoid it.<br/><br/>But the first hour is still more bearable than the similarly draggy moments in Reloaded; there are several cool scenes, like the end result when Neo tries running out of the subway or the shootout in Club Hel.  There's also a more palpable feeling of suspense, what with the imminent destruction of Zion.<br/><br/>Where the film really takes off and almost never loses its footing from here on out is the Zion battle sequence.  It's a fabulously thriling and intense setpiece, as the sentinels bear down in droves into the dock and are, for a short while at least, held at bay by a massive army of APUs (many claim they're inspired by Aliens, but they're more similar to anime designs that existed prior to the James Cameron flick) and machine guns.  The twenty-minute battle is split three ways, but it's definitely the dock segment, which heavily resembles Starship Troopers, that delivers the most thrills.  I was particularly taken by Nathaniel Lees kick-ass Mifune, whose gung-ho attitude is exhilaratingly infectious.<br/><br/>The battle still raises at least one major question; (mild spoiler) it's suggested at one point that one of the returning ship's EMP could knock out part of the invading force of sentinels.  Sure, it's something that should only be considered as a last-minute contingency plan, but shouldn't the Zion army have at least kept one of the ships behind in the most likely case that such an act of desperation would be needed?<br/><br/>The non-stop action continues with Neo and Trinity's journey to the Machine City, leading to the trilogy's most purely awe-inspiring scene, the beautiful sight of sunlight.  The Wachowskis also have the cajones to kill off major characters, and I cared enough about the leads to be moved by their sacrifices.<br/><br/>The climactic action sequence, the showdown between Neo and Smith, is a classic case of repetition.  Return of the Jedi had the same problem, considering it involved attacking yet another Death Star.  But the grievance here is to a far lesser extent as the fight does boast more than enough variety to separate it from the previous Neo/Smith brawls.  That said, the first half of the sequence is great, full of rousing choral music and slick martial arts choreography mixed with stylish slow-motion and freeze frame shots (one gets the feeling, though, that all this would have been utterly mind-blowing four years ago, and not just a blast to watch).  I especially loved the setting and look of the scene, the dark green tint and pouring rain amidst the lightning-wracked sky.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the latter half of the brawl is less satisfying, with Smith prattling on about the pointlessness of Neo's struggle.  Seriously, I just want to see the supermen duking it out, there's no need to strive for the greater meaning here.  The overall conclusion is satisfying enough on an initial viewing, but raises more questions than are answered.<br/><br/>For one, I think it's safe to assume that everyone in the Matrix is at least a little leery and suspicious of their world, they've just seen a man in sunglasses absorb the entire population.  Thus, it's likely many will come to the conclusion that their world is a fabrication.  (Major spoiler) The Architect's final words, stating something along the lines of the fact that anyone who wants to be freed will be freed resolves nothing, making one wonder why machines had to even use humans as batteries in the first place.<br/><br/>As I write this review, I realize I've spent more time harping on the movie's faults, but the truth of the matter is that I had a great time watching this film.  Taken purely as a sci-fi action epic, it delivers first-rate excitement and thrills and moves at a much faster pace than either of its predecessors.  Sure, it barely touches on the concept of the Matrix, but I'd rather fault that with Reloaded, as Revolutions' primary intent was to conclude the saga with battles and brawn, and not to further dwelve into the fabricated world of the Matrix."

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/> This movie reflects what I would call questionable values and world-view, meaning that we are led to believe that nothing has really developed in the future and the world is still based on muscles, violence and the myth of Christ (the 'chosen' one). We can actually get to see God in this who looks like the laughing Baby in the Teletubbies.  I belong to the large group of people that enjoyed the first part of Matrix - its intelligent twists, its freshness, visual effects and depth. Then comes the follow-up with money, violence and tits. What a waste of money and time. I did not see the 2nd part because was advised not to see it, but out of curiosity watched the final part on a plane.  It was so bad and so offensive to intelligence that watching it almost made me mad.<br/><br/>This movie is based on movie cliches (bad writing), stereotypes (one-dimensional characters)and special effects of music videos(lack of plot). Not much has changed in the world - women still dress up like in R&B music videos (does Monica Bellucci have any other meaning in the movie that to show her tits - I recall that she is considered a talented actress in Italy but here she can only show her body parts - the black female pilot, Jada Pinkett, is the typical 'tomboy' character that gets to 'kick guy's butt' - still, in a close-up you get to see her breasts under her shirt - was that really necessary? you need to be sexy to drive really fast?). The couples are strickly non-inter-racial (so strange that assuming that in the future there will be much more 'mixture' between people from different ethnics) and the 'real action' is still led by men and by men only.<br/><br/> And the world peace is resolved in a (physical) fight between between good and evil. The movie reflects Christian values and sacrifice (Neo sacrifices himself for the greater good), just that non-violence is not an issue since the chosen one is to guy who can hit harder and faster. I found the last scene not visually stunning but boring without any surprise - a scene that thas been repeated a million times in the history of the cinema. This is not the Matrix (the first part), that was setting some questions, intelligent plot-lines and interesting characters (there we had at least a couple of women that contibuted equally to the action) - no, this is a Steven Seagul-film in a prettier wrap. The depth of the plot and characters is from a B or C-class action movie with stunningly stupid dialogue. And then we have this Christ, this leader that wanders from place to place looking like he did not have a clue, has nothing interesting to say and then is ready to show his muscles when the time comes. Pathetic."

"oneflewovertheapocalypse","Null","1","2","28 February 2004"," The Best in my opinion
","The Matrix was born in summer of 1999, it opened up a whole new way of film making and created a buzz around Hollywood that had not been heard since the reign of Star Wars back in 1977, the movie opened to rave reviews by critics and among every filmgoer in the world asked the question `What is the Matrix'?   I am still trying to figure that out because the Matrix isn't the easiest of films to understand but there's nothing wrong with a little bit of thinking now is there.<br/><br/>In summer 2002 we were treated with the Matrix Reloaded which didn't get the warmest of welcomes but in time and I think it will be appreciated for setting up the third instalment which has just been released The Matrix Revolutions which holds the tagline `Every Beginning has an End', I won't tell if that statement is true, you'll have to go and see that for yourself and it's fair to have you're opinion on films, but I thought he was being a bit harsh to tell you the truth, because I don't think Revolutions lives up to the first instalment but I am someone who didn't actually like the first one as it just wasn't a film I connected with and when I captured the grand ore of Reloaded and I found myself believing in the Matrix as it became more apparent to what the whole story was about and I actually think Revolutions is the epic film out of the trilogy we have been waiting for. It starts off where Reloaded finished and you are straight away sucked back into the war which is about to happen between the humans and the machines, but you do get the feel that you are watching a film which is way over you're head, but the longer it goes on the more we see what is about to happen.    Neo is in a coma after fighting off the sentinels at the end of Reloaded, Trinity and Morpheus are coming up with solutions to what to do next and Agent Smith is just trying to rule everything with his army of clones.    The acting is very good, not superb but you can't have everything, the dialogue is above standard with the odd giggle from time to time, and the battle scenes alone hold this film to be a contender to be one of the best films in the trilogy. The idea of the films was the first would be deal with Birth, the second would deal with life and the third would be about Death, so it comes across that Neo is Jesus in a futuristic land trying to save everybody except himself, because that's another thing that the films deals with and that's sacrifice."
"Pavel-8","7","1","2","11 January 2004"," That's it?
","**WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD!**<br/><br/>(I avoid explicitly revealing most info, but I also make a number of vague references.)<br/><br/>As one who loved the original ""Matrix,"" I was obviously drooling over the release of two sequels this year. After seeing ""Reloaded"" (which I thought very good as part one of two), I was awed by the action scenes and special effects, intrigued by the mechanics of the relationship between machines and men, and puzzled by exactly how everything would end up in the third film.<br/><br/>""Revolutions"" is an above average film, much like ""The Godfather, Part III"" is an above average film. They both rode the coattails of their predecessors in that they took compelling characters in which people have vested interest and continued their lives through truly interesting events. But while ""Part III"" ended in an inevitable manner that fit well, ""Revolutions"" twists things in the last act, leaving viewers slightly uncomfortable with the result.<br/><br/>If you've seen the first two, you know what the basic plot of ""Revolutions"" is; you just don't know how it will be executed. The what is simple. The machines are trying to destroy the humans; Smith is trying to destroy Neo; the humans and Neo obviously object to those wishes. The how...aye, there's the rub. Chances are it doesn't occur as you anticipated.<br/><br/>The reason is that in the first two movies, and for much of the third, the primary conflict presented is that between man and machines. Then in the last thirty minutes, that emphasis shifts abruptly to Neo versus Smith. Having been set up for a showdown between man and machines for over six hours of film, the final resolution was unsatisfying, particularly because our rooting interest is with the humans. I suppose that option is highly desirable in the face of the alternative, but it still left an aftertaste that was not bitter, but was definitely unwanted.<br/><br/>Another core problem with ""Revolutions"" is that the continual introduction of more characters means less screen time and development for those people we care about most (Neo, Trinity, Morpheus). After their initial trek into the Matrix, Trinity and Morpheus serve mostly as vessels for the rest of the flick. Trinity to drive and Morpheus to remind everyone to believe. Particularly as the movie resolves, too many of the characters' final moments are trite and tacked on out of necessity rather than purpose. You're telling me that after being the baddest movie chick since ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" Trinity goes out like that? Weak. Morpheus just smiles, nods, and hugs Niobe? Seriously folks, I think he might have been a wee bit excited upon seeing his lifelong beliefs fulfilled. Neo? I'm not even completely certain of his final fate. As someone who has invested many hours in these characters, that's extremely frustrating and unsatisfying.<br/><br/>
But at the crux of my issues with ""Revolutions"" lies a basic breakdown in narrative theory. A large part of what made ""Matrix"" so popular was the way that the Wachowskis placed the audience in Neo's shoes, revealing information to them as it was revealed to him. This sucked the viewers in and made them feel more involved in the film. In Reloaded, the audience is placed primarily in the role of Morpheus. Since Neo has realized much of his abilities, we common folk relate more to Morpheus, especially as doubt creeps in about how the system works. His unshakable creedence in Neo parallels ours. We, like Morpheus, want him to triumph, kicking machine and Smith tail along the way. In ""Revolutions,"" I don't see a character that fills that role. Link and his wife Zee fill the parts of commonfolk, but since neither is deeply developed, that doesn't work very well. Niobe is the human about whom we learn the most, and she is a strong and truly intriguing character. But we are still enlightened only to the soldier side of her, and she also eventually lapses into a predictable finish. This all adds up to a missing hook, without which getting into the film is more difficult.<br/><br/>
Moving on to other aspects of the film...<br/><br/>Although the characters aren't as easy to get into, the world definitely is, thanks to an again stellar production design, especially the colors. The earthy tones of Zion; the emerald hue of the Matrix; the sterile nature of the train station; and the grim and gray reality of the earth's surface. All of these places portray a vividly imaginative yet still plausible and fascinating world that is enhanced by cinematography containing typical Wachowski flair. Placing still and moving cameras at all angles, the brothers use a style grounded in simplicity, but not afraid to have fun. It reminds me of Spielberg's work on something like The Lost World, in which every few minutes, you get a fun shot that evokes a chuckle or smile.<br/><br/>
Although the action doesn't seem as prevalent as in either predecessor, the three primary action scenes are excellent, at least on their own merits. The fight at the Merovingian's club is fully enjoyable; the last stand in Zion is epic in nature; and Neo's battle with Agent Smith also justly draws oohs and aahs. However none of the three appear as groundbreaking as the work in the two prequels. The club fight, although with the added dimension of ceiling walkers, is a small scale version of the government lobby scene. The largely computer generated war for Zion (but I don't remember once noticing blatant CGI) is unique and impressive for its scope and combatants, but was not all that different from a typical hold-the-fort scene. The Neo v. Smith fight is the most visually arresting action sequence. Utilizing creative combinations of light and shadow along with quality effects such as slow motion amidst the pouring rain, the Wachowskis once again craft splendid eye candy using state of the art visual effects and martial arts.<br/><br/>The acting in ""Revolutions"" is nothing special, but neither does it detract from the film. Of equal importance is that everyone looks their part exceptionally well. The script is what is different. While each of the first two films presented a variety of information, both philosophical and expository, this one eschews that in favor of a more traditional straightforward progression of action. Even though the dialogue scenes seemed to slow down Reloaded, those passages were missed here, as they added depth to the films, separating them from most common flicks.<br/><br/>Bottom Line (elongated):  Despite my unbalanced list of deficiencies versus pluses, I honestly did enjoy this movie. However the end left me very unsatisfied, with an underwhelmed sense of ""That's it?"" I walked out of the original completely infatuated with what I had just seen. I left Reloaded on a special effects high, eagerly anticipating the finale. But I departed Revolutions slightly disappointed and unsatisfied.<br/><br/>(Side note: I still think Revolutions is a film that would have been above average on its own. In fact, I think the Wachowskis could have axed the Agent Smith stuff from the last two movies, altered the ending, and made a single more concise and satisfying movie. Then again, what do I know? But it has the misfortune of following a great film and a great appetizer. So while it is still a must see to finish the story, Revolutions is relegated to be an enjoyable and necessary but disappointing final episode in an epic trilogy.)"

","Well, firstly the revolutions is brilliant.Possibly the most logical conclusion to this awesome triology. Before you all succumb to the critics,and the ranting of all those people that seem to think that revolutions was not worth it-you need to understand that no matter what the Wachowski brothers do there're gonna be people out there criticizing them.<br/><br/>Go with an open mind remembering that this movie is actually a conclusion to the reloaded and a part of it. Look at both of them together as one and then you realize that there couldn't have been fight after fight in this movie, morpheus could not play a major part(whatever he believed in was pretty much dashed in the reloaded ), neo could not be there all the time.<br/><br/>The apocalypse is here - the day of revelation - the battle between the machines and men -and this is where the matrix revolutions scores. It's got the best battle sequences and just like the matrix original the filming of zion  and that of the machine raises the bar of special effects a tad higher; like only the wachowski brothers could. Believe me the 20 minute or so action sequence of the battle is totally awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>By the same token ,the climax,the fight between Agent smith and Neo is the stuff the legends are made of. I knew this one had to be really really special to justify everything the matrix has stood for- and believe me it really is!!!<br/><br/>OVERALL<br/><br/>An excellent movie. The revolutions is more like the original Matrix. A very cleverly made movie with an engrossing story line as opposed to the reloaded.<br/><br/>I certainly do hope that they make a fourth installment.

"Rob_Taylor","7","1","2","20 November 2003"," Here we go.......again! Yawn.
","Less than 6 months after the underwhelming Reloaded, here comes Revolutions. And it's similarly underwhelming. Not quite as much as Reloaded, because it did have its moments. But all in all, not as good a conclusion as I had hoped. In fact, I begin to fear it's not a conclusion at all, but just the beginning of a long running franchise, possibly doomed to the likes of mini-series and TV movies, with unknown actors replacing the real stars and the whole thing ending up in an unhealthy, Galactica 1980 kind of stupidity.<br/><br/>That said, Revolutions is better than Reloaded. The dock combat sequence was very interesting, though the combat mechanoids are not a new idea by any stretch of the imagination. In fact the APU's are not even particularly well designed, from a combat point of view - those dangling ammunition belts are just woefully wrong and entirely out of place in anything except a Rambo film.<br/><br/>The sentinels swirled around like a shoal of fish, which was a nice visual touch, but I couldn't for the life of me understand why, once that many of them (thousands) had gotten into Zion, they didn't simply swarm over the defenders like bees from all sides at once. Would have made for boring cinema, I guess, but not very realistic. There were also a number of scenes involving shoulder launched missiles that reminded me all too much of Starship Troopers. Also, didn't the sentinels throw bombs in the first movie? Why didn't they do that in Zion?<br/><br/>At least Revolutions didn't have the sickly sweet, everything turns out fine for everyone, ending that Hollywood tiresomely trots out again and again. A main character dies! Love does not conquer all. Good doesn't triumph over evil without batting an eyelid. All good points in an otherwise lacklustre movie. Other good things include fewer endless martial arts scenes where the fight goes on, and on, and on, like everyone has Duracell's fitted.<br/><br/>A lot of plot points, which fans hoped would be explained, were glossed over, ignored, or given stupid answers. For example, Neo's ability to use his powers outside of the Matrix we are told is ""because he is the One"" and that's it. Pseudo-religious crap. And there's a limbo-like area between the Matrix and the Real World. More pseudo-religious crap. There are also several more ""psycho-babble"" moments where exposition goes crazy and you end up gritting your teeth, hoping the film will actually continue before too much longer, so that you don't start to nod off. Another thing which bugged me - the ships have EMP devices, but Zion does not? The number one way of defeating sentinels and the Zionists (yet more pseudo-religion there) don't think its a good idea to run up a few score spares? Instead they resort to men in armoured suits and bullets. Hmmmm. This kind of ""let's write an exciting story, but not think what people would actually do in such a situation"" writing is what really pi$$es me off with cinema today. Sure, the initial viewing may be favourable, because we can all overlook such things, but re-watch factor becomes less and less when we have our intelligence insulted by such awful plot failings.<br/><br/>By the way, am I the only person who finds the Oracle to get increasingly irritating as the movies have progressed? So smug, so ""know-it-all"". Gah! Shame she doesn't get her program erased!<br/><br/>On the bright side, my enjoyment of the film was boosted immensely by the appearance of Bruce Spence as the ""The Train Man"". Nice to see him on film again. A small role, but worth it.<br/><br/>All in all another underwhelming movie that cannot live up to its hype, or the success of the original. Mostly down to the FX crews ever raising the bar of our visual expectations. The extraordinary is now ordinary and we demand something spectacular in order to be wowed. Revolutions has its moments, and is worth watching, but its nothing special anymore.<br/><br/>The original will continue to have a place in my DVD collection, but I'll not be shelling out cash for the sequels. The Wachowski's may have come up with a great idea in ""The Matrix"" but time has proven them unable to take the idea and run with it."

","If you weren't a fan of ""Matrix: Reloaded"", then you'll be happy with ""Revolutions"".  I wanted to like ""Reloaded"" - I even saw it twice in the theaters hoping the film would win me over the second time.  Sadly, I came away disappointed both times.  But where ""Reloaded"" fails, ""Revolutions"" succeeds.  This film is so good, it makes ""Reloaded"" that much better. ""Revolutions"" fits in with the themes established in the first movie. Characters and action sequences are done because they flow with the story. This contrasts ""Reloaded"" which seemed to have a lot of superfluous characters and action just for the sake of showcasing the special effects. Maybe some of the novelty of being inside the matrix itself has worn off, but the effects are still incredible - and the battle for Zion is outstanding.  Gone are the sloppy effect easily visible in ""Reloaded"". ""Revolutions"" is an outstanding end to the trilogy, which hit a major speed-bump with the second film.  As ""Revolutions"" is seeing only modest box-office success, hopefully people will see this movie on DVD and realize just how good it is."

","The time has now come for me to comment on this Revolution. Let me first begin with commenting on all of the negative reviews this film has received. As I read through the comments and reviews it appears evident how many un-conscious people there are in this world. Now when I say conscious I mean the very act of awareness, awareness of your own perception and all prior to that. Everyone is saying its not the original, its not as good, well of course not nothing can replace your first viewing of the Matrix (99) stop trying to replace that. You have to realize these movies are perfect even in there own in-perfections, Everyone is missing the true message in this film, people are not looking between the lines, everyone keeps commenting on the religious reflection in this movie but that let me reflect this on you. You see in organized religion people are being told what to believe, how to think, how to act. But you see in this film it is different, it has proficient spiritual essence which indicates the act of self inquiry(IMAGINATION). I keep hearing in this film none of the questions are answered but that is far from the truth, but unlike religion and every other movie you actually have to figure it out. You see the truth lies between the words. Everyone just wants to be told what to believe and what to think because they are to afraid to think for themselves and when they don't understand something they bash it in a struggle of infectious confusion. There is way more to this movie than anyone can even conceive. When talking to people who have quarrels with this film complaining about the plot and how it makes no sense, nothing was answered, they usually leave the conversation either looking really stupid after being reflected of there own ignorance or completely enlightened to the fact that there is meaning and truth to what was done, That if I can find the answers within this film then what in there own perception disables them to see that. The answers are there you just have to be ready to hear them and I AM sorry to say most people are not and that is why they are all a sleep in there tiny little machine powered program driven pods we call the world.<br/><br/>On the other hand this movie is perfection. The end is great, you just have to understand and let down your expectations, prepare to be filled with an amazing Truth."
"rbverhoef","7","1","2","19 November 2003"," Spectacular, but disappointing
","'The Matrix Revolutions' is not as good as 'The Matrix Reloaded', which was not as good as 'The Matrix', and it is not as spectacular. If you thought 'Reloaded' was a disappointment you will probably not like this installment.<br/><br/>The story goes to the attack of Zion and Neo (Keanu Reeves) on a mission to the Machine City, together with Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) try to arrive in Zion on time to stop the machines. Of course Smith (Hugo Weaving) is causing some problems.<br/><br/>There are spectacular scenes here, although I think the best were in 'Reloaded', but that is about it. The attack on Zion is way too long, and things simply didn't feel as 'The Matrix' anymore. In the end that feeling came back, a little. The final sequence are spectacular and felt right. Not bad, but compared to the other two movies a disappointment."

","I originally gave the movie a lower score but I have changed it to a 10. I have since re-watched all three films and have come to see the incredible depth and detail of this series. Things I thought were silly or out of place turn out to be important and very much a part of the story. Know this, NOTHING is unimportant in these films, everything and everyone has a purpose and a meaning. The series is filled with so many metaphors and symbols that it takes hours of dissection to understand them all. But now I do and I am amazed at the complexity and subtly."
"JasonL","10","1","2","15 November 2003"," Matrix series are sci-fi movie for programmers, not philosophical movie
","Contains spoilers some one will like it, but some one will dislike it.<br/><br/>I think it is not as good as Matrix I, but better than Matrix Reloaded.<br/><br/>It's quite consistent with the other two Matrix movies, full of actions, very exciting battle scenes. The zion battle can match the Helms Deep battle in Lord of Rings The Two Towers.<br/><br/>From this movie you can get a more overall view of the 'real world', including both zion and the machine city, where the brain of the machine is located. You can have a better understanding the position of the machines, the virus agent Smith, Oracle, Architect, and zion in the 'real world'.<br/><br/>But the plot is less creative than the first Matrix movie. It is somewhat,..., cliched. Although there is still some surprise awaiting you.<br/><br/>From the beginning, Matrix is not a 'hard sci-fi' movie. By 'hard sci-fi' I mean sci-fi's shows more respect for fundamental physics, such as 'contact' and '2001 space odessy', which are generally great works of real scientists.<br/><br/>Matrix, is somewhat between 'soft sci-fi' and 'hard sci-fi'. It is 'hard' in the aspect of programmer's point of view. Its constructs, the 'program characters' in the matrix, are quite believable to programmers. Because if you design such a system, there may really be such objects. (unfortunately some non-programmer audience tends to regard those 'program characters' like oracle, seraph, architect as philosophical symbols, that's a total misunderstanding, and will definitely result in confusion and disappointment. Matrix is a sci-fi movie for programmers, not a philosophical movie for folks. it has some philosophy, but its main interests is not there).<br/><br/>Matrix is not 'hard sci-fi' because it makes some ridiculous assumptions which physicists will laugh. For example, use human body as batteries for machines, neo's super-natural capability extends to real world without any physical explanation ('The One has power not only in Matrix, but also in real world', that's it, no explanation. no wonder people have quarreled on this problem will feel being fooled by the W brothers)<br/><br/>Another major plot hole is the negotiation between the machine's head with neo. After neo helped the machines killed Agent Smith in Matrix and died, why should Machine still obeys its promise? It can jut destroy Zion without any problem. Neo has died, no one can threat the machines, why should machine obey its promise? I don't believe machines have moral standard like human.<br/><br/>Finally a summary of the plot for those interested:<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie neo was in coma, but actually his mind was trapped in a place between matrix and real world, which is represented as a train station, which is controled by a train man who obeys order of Merovigin. Morpheus and Trinity knew that from Oracle and saved Neo from the trap.<br/><br/>Agent Smith converted more and more entities in Matrix to himself. Oracle feels the threat of Agent Smith. If no one stop him, that will be the end of the Matrix. Oracle knew that, so she gave some hint to Neo. Soon after that, Agent Smith find her, and converted her and Seraph to his copies.<br/><br/>At the same time, there is a battle between machine and Zion. That is a battle in despire. Machines are overwhelming in numbers. Obviously human will lose this battle finally.<br/><br/>Neo and trinity went to the machine city. They encounter strong defenses and Trinity died there. Neo finally faces the head of the machine. He negotiated with the machine head: he will help the machine destroy Agent Smith, while machine will stop destroying Zion.<br/><br/>Machine help Neo back to Matrix, where he fights with Agent Smith and lose. Agent Smith converted Neo into himself. But since Neo was plugged by machine. Machine can decode and destroy the entity he is converted into. And machine also destroyed all other copies of Agent Smith.<br/><br/>So Neo died in real world. But machines kept their promise and left Zion. And the order of Matrix is restored, and Oracle and Seraph and others restored to their original state.<br/><br/>Final words from Oracle, Neo may or may not be back.<br/><br/>That is matrix. So there is temperary peace between human and machines. Some one did not understand the movie at all. Some one are not satisfied with the result. But what do you expect? what can you expect?<br/><br/>Maybe they should let Neo live and destroy all machines? That may be more cliched."

","There seems to be a lot of controversy over what rating to give to Revolutions. It would seem that this is being fueled by a serious passion for the Matrix series and ultimately a big let down to many fans.<br/><br/>I myself, enjoyed the film. There's no question that it wasn't as good as the Matrix, but few films have been. The concern I have is that people are becoming angry that it wasn't as good. Case in point, have a look at the user rating results break down on this site. Over 1,000 movie lovers have rated this film a ""1"". Another 1,000 see it as a ""2"" or ""3"".<br/><br/>Keep in mind, these are no average moviegoers, these are IMDB members. Consider the absurdity of rating this film a ""1"". The Matrix Revolutions, in and of itself, is still a good if not great action film. It is well made... great sound... great effects... stunning costumes and set design... well choreographed fight scenes... so-so dialog and acting... still an interesting story, but no Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>Then what we are left with is a well crafted film with some minor flaws and an 800 pound gorilla on its back (Being part of the original Matrix franchise).<br/><br/>Anyway, assuming you have already voted for this film and are still reading this, I would urge you to recast your vote with less retribution in mind. If you would like to see some movies that really might deserve a 1 out of 10, I suggest renting some classic Ed Wood films, or anything that stars Anna Nicole Smith."

"pomoxian","8","1","2","15 November 2003"," Free Your Mind (of preconceived notions)
","I will admit, the first time I saw this movie, I didn't have a clear sense of satisfaction upon leaving the theater.  There was a lot that I liked about the movie while I was watching it, but I had to take my time to let it sink in before I could settle on an unambiguous thumbs up/thumbs down decision.  Which was different than how I responded to the first two movies in this series (I liked them both a lot.) Having said that...<br/><br/>My experience watching Matrix Revolutions again was overall quite enjoyable, a lot more fun than the first time I saw it in terms of simply appreciating the film for what it is. I've gotten over the apprehensions, curiosities and other expectations that had accumulated over the past several months (the interval between Reloaded and Revolutions.) I'd read other peoples' reviews, blogs and scattered thoughts, talked about it with a few people who've seen it, and thought through what I saw the first time. Now I could just sit back and let it sink in more gradually, taking the finished work in on its own terms.<br/><br/>The final verdict in my book is that this was a very good, satisfying and worthy successor to the first movie, which is still more or less perfectly complete in itself. The trilogy as a whole didn't ""need"" to be made as far as the original Matrix film was concerned, but it happened and we now have a large-scale epic that tosses out a lot of big questions, aggressively pushes special effects forward, makes several fashion statements along the way and will soon take its place (once the DVD of the last movie is released) as a pop-culture relic to be studied, examined and debated for years to come.<br/><br/>As far as the story itself, it made more sense to me this time. I could reflect on the course of the dialogue more patiently, get a clearer read on what the foreshadowing was pointing the audience toward, and just smile at the visual grandeur of so many scenes. I won't get into a fine-detail analysis of the various symbols, myths and metaphors of the film. I have other things to do this morning. But given my previously expressed ambivalence after seeing it for the first time, I want to come out and give Matrix Revolutions a heartier endorsement this time around. Assuming that you basically liked the concepts and presentation of this movie series in the first place, I would encourage any viewer who seemed disappointed with the first viewing to give the film another shot to see if anything improves after checking out the rerun."
"Nintendomaster13","10","1","2","15 November 2003"," Nothing short of fantastic
","It all started when I was watching matrix reloaded and it had ""To Be Continued"".  I waited until now to see it and it was everything I expected and more.  The visual effects are the best although the computer generated images of humans still lacking but hey, still no one has been able to make a computer generated human that actually looked real.  The relationship with Neo and Trinity ends a little cheesy like.  If you are into battle movies, this is the one for you.  The battle sceen goes on for a long time and you will never want it to end.  If you liked all the profisizing in reloaded, u will be disappointed in this one as it doesn't have much of that but I thought reloaded had too much in the first place.  Sadly, like the oracle said, ""everything with a beginning has an end"" and the movie and the trilogy ended.  You must go see this movie.  easily a 10/10.  and now i leave you with these words ""If we give them our lives, WE GIVE THEM HELL BEFORE WE DO!!!"""

I missed the link.  It was obvious enough that Smith was Oracle (somehow.  i think? the whole bit about beginning and end).  but Smith exploded, and Oracle took his place?  Or was Oracle Neo??  Or worse, is Oracle Smith??  Where is Neo in the Matrix after the fight?<br/><br/>Back to M2, I really hated the temple scenes and the sex scenes between Neo and Trinity.

What a beautiful sunrise, what a happy ending!<br/><br/>There is apparently no consistency between the plot lines of the Matrix, Reloaded, and Revolutions. Wasnt the Matrix supposed to crash if the code Neo carried wasnt reinserted? The architect will free more and more people to join the folks in Zion who are going to be happy to live under ground forever and never bother the machines again? I dont think so.<br/><br/>More likely, there will be another One created by the architect to stabalize the ever decaying Matrix, and the Machines will once again wipe out Zion as the humans try to branch out due to their ever increasing population thanks to the architect freeing people. This whole process will start over again so these movies really accomplished nothing plot wise.<br/><br/>Dont get me wrong the first two are among my favorite movies of all time.

I enjoyed the movie and thought the ending was acceptable. My only disappointment was the limited action inside the Matrix, the slick hyper-reality that is the real selling point of these films to the masses of movie-goers who prefer excessive eye candy to thoughtful plot development. If you like the Matrix movies because of the special effects, the fight choreography, and the advanced filming techniques, this one will leave you disappointed.  If you are dying to find out what the prophecy is, if Neo will succeed in his mission, how Zion will fend off the invasion of the machines, and the rest of the story then this movie will be very satisfying indeed.

Very well done. But the movie has its flaws. Some questions presented in Reloaded have unknown answers. Will it be a forth movie? A new videogame? I don't know.

I'm not writing this to say iv changed my mind because I haven't, id still rate it 10/10, I think its amazing.

The Wachowski brothers have put a lot of thought into making this movie and a hell of a lot of thought has got to go into it from US. I had to watch the 1st one twice to understand it a bit more and so did a lot of people i know so what the hell did you expect from the 2 long awaited sequels.

I mean come on, did you really want to go see a movie that you know the ending to? you could watch Titanic for that, everyone knew it was going to sink at the end. You could watch Pearl Harbour, you know it will get the hell blown out of it.<br/><br/>If you wanted to see a movie that is full of action with a simple story line I suggest you watch XXX (with Vin Diesel)<br/><br/>I am so excited about The Matrix trilogy coming out on DVD.

It did sort of just...end. Thats why there is a lot of talk about a 4th part. A 4th Part!? Hell Yeah bring it on. I welcome a 4th part, in fact i demand it, we need some more explanations, we need to know what is going to happened now the war is over...it is over is'nt it? What of The Matrix though, it ain't exactly destroyed, not how I imagined it would be anyway. What happens now???? The Wachowski brothers need to answer a few questions, I mean, what , so we just start living in peace with these big ass Sentinels flying around and a big ass Machine City covering have the country, and anyway, is that the only machine city?? How do we know there is'nt multiple Matrix's, one powering each City....?<br/><br/>So many more theories!!<br/><br/>I love The Matrix Trilogy so why not make it a ""Quadrilogy!"" That would be great in my opinion, it would make the other 3 better because it could explain a lot that hasn't been explained. And then just maybe all you people out there that don't understand it and instead of watching it a few more times (like you have to with many movies...2001 anyone?), just say that its crap, could then understand it and then you could eat your words and you too would love the Trilogy.<br/><br/>Excellent Film, Excellent Trilogy, Excellent effects.....Excellent. I like the thank the Wachowski brothers for such good entertainment, such a good film/script and effects.

","Really, if you want to watch one thats not a good one, watch this one because it's not.  It starts off and you can tell there wont be enough fighting.  I preferred school of rock really.  Someone should make a rule against these guys who make movies just to make money because this one really grabbed the boat there.  talk to someone you respect about their opinion of the movie because if you dont you will really see one thats really bad, really.  it just goes on and on and you should think it wont but it does and in the end theres not enough fighting.  shame on the script of course, and the underground stuff was pure garbage too.  I think that all copies of this movie should be collected and sent into space... preferably into a black hole rather than a star because that way the atoms that the movie encoded on wont be around anymore either, they will just be energy in a singularity.  Anyways, enough digression, MORE FIGHTING!"

","***SPOILERS WITHIN***  Please do not read below this unless you have seen the movie.<br/><br/>I seriously liked this movie.  As a conclusion, I rate it a 10as a trilogy, I rate the Matrix as a 10.  However, the Brothers Wachowski are not surprised by many of your reactions.  Each of the actors and creators of this movie at one time or another expressed doubt that most people would `get' this movie.  They figured that at times, it would get too deep for the average moviegoer, which is why they knew they had to make a movie that did wonderful visual things.  Because `Thinking' movies do not tend to do well on their own.  They needed to make money from people who wouldn't get the movie as well as people who would.<br/><br/>First off, let me say that every character in this movie was necessary to the `inevitable' climax.  From Morpheus, to Trinity, to the Real World Smith.  I have seen many comments saying that Bane (Real World Smith) was unnecessary.  He was, I assure you.  Neo needed to be convinced that the threat of Smith was real.  He needed to see that even if no one ever went into the Matrix, the threat of Smith was going to be continual.  As Smith (as Bane) said in the movie, `There is nowhere I cannot gonothing I cannot do.'  Neo needed to know that this was the truth.<br/><br/>Next, allow me to say that I do not believe that Smith and Neo's melding and destruction did not kill everyone in the Matrix.  The dialog between the Architect and the Oracle make it perfectly clear that there are still those in the Matrix who will either want to be released or will want to stay in the Matrix.<br/><br/>Now, it is also crucial for all to understand that this outcome (coexistence) was the only possible outcome for this movie.  The machines were too powerful, and no one could simply beat them.  However, this movie would not have been satisfying if the machines had won.  However, what The Oracle, Neo and the Machines understood was that coexistence is the only possible way to end the war.  Oracle, `The only way to get there is TOGETHER.'  She knew what was necessary, but not how they were to achieve it.  So what WAS the outcome?  What happened in that final act of Smith resulting in the destruction of the Smiths and Neo?<br/><br/>The Oracle saw it best.  She told Neo that Smith was his balance.  If Neo was The One, Smith was Negative One.  Add 1 to -1 and you get 0.  They cancelled each other out.  So why did that cause the machines to relent?  It was the result of a peace treaty.<br/><br/>Neo had made the machines understand that they would never be able to defeat Smith.  He also told them that Smith would become a very REAL problem for them.  The fact that they let Neo back into the Matrix was their concession of this fact despite their statement to the contrary.  `WE DO NOT NEED ANYONE!!!!'  Neo didn't know how he was going to destroy Smithhe only knew that based on his deal with the machines, if he did destroy Smith, the war would be over.  If he didn't, all humans would likely be destroyed.  So in the destruction of himself, (some say ascension, though I doubt it), he saw the good of the many outweighed the good of the few.  (Thanx, Spock.)  He knew that his destruction would result in their salvation.yes, it parallels the Christ story.<br/><br/>So where does that leave us?  Well, the Matrix still exists to provide power for the machines.  There are still humans attached to it.  Does that mean this was all for nothing?  Far from it.<br/><br/>The scenes in the Matrix were tinged with green.  This shows the false nature of the Matrix.  The obviously contrived reality of the Matrix.  At the end, however, the colors are more truemore vivid.  This shows the new nature of the Matrix.  The Oracle asks the Architect what will happen to the people who want out.  The Architect says they will be released.  However, I think that the Architect finally sees his dream realized.  He can now give the people choice.  But he can also build a utopia where there is no sickness or disease, or death.  The reason that the humans rejected the first matrix was not because of the utopia, but because of the lack of choice involved.  As he said, `The Problem is Choice.'  There are people who will choose the Matrix over reality.  (If the Matrix is better than reality, which is what I believe they will make it.)<br/><br/>So why this outcome?  Watch the Animatrix.  ***Animatrix Spoilers*** <br/><br/>
The machines originally only wanted a country of their own where they could eke out an existence, trading and living with humans.  But humans denied them that right and persecuted them.  The machines then struck back, committing just as great an evil by enslaving the human race, as the humans did in persecuting the machines.  The pendulum swung just as far back the other way.  Now, intelligent humans like Morpheus and the Council see that all they want is an end to the war.  The machines need only look back and they will remember that all they wanted was coexistence.  The humans have been forcefully shown the error of their ways, and the machines, without a need to defend themselves, and being presented with a much more profitable alternative will find in their cost-benefit analysis that peaceful coexistence is the most logical way to go.<br/><br/>This is what I believe the Matrix is saying.  You may not like the way the story was presented, and you are entitled to that opinion.  (Though I disagree.)  Thank you for read such a lengthy review.  I hope you enjoyed it."

This had a good story, great effects, and a lot of suspense.  This one makes you think and ask questions like the first one did.

"TheBabblingFool","10","1","2","10 November 2003"," Still drooling...
","I am a die hard Matrix fan. I practically have memorized every shot in The Matrix. I went into The Matrix Reloaded the first showing of the first day, and was blown away. I helped suppress the torture that was waiting 6 months for The Matrix Revolutions with Enter the Matrix and The Animatrix. Although I didn't expect to instantly love The Matrix Revolutions (I always, as a movie fan, try not to go into the theater with expectations of liking or hating it, it just ruins films) I sure didn't set myself up to love it.<br/><br/>But I didn't set myself up to instantly love this movie when I first saw it in the theater. I saw it at the 9 a.m. World Wide Zero Hour showing, which put me in a tired mood because for me, getting up before 10 a.m. is a challenge. I also skipped breakfast, so I was hungry. And of course wouldn't you know it about 15 minutes into the movie I have the need to use the restroom. Not exactly the best movie watching state. But not even my sleep deprivation, my growling stomach, and my bladder that was about to burst could have moved me from that chair.<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions fixes the faults of Reloaded. The philosophical undertones in the dialogue weren't so blatantly on the surface. The action scenes actually had a point to them. Also the pacing was improved; this movie takes about 15 minutes to gather itself and then blasts off at a break-neck speed.<br/><br/>There is a neat shootout involving Morpheus, Trinity, and Seraph, which they fight foes who run on the ceiling. It's not as cool as say, the lobby shootout from The Matrix, but it's pretty sweet and crazy.<br/><br/>
The real show stealer in this movie is the battle for Zion. It's probably a 20 minute action sequence which blew my mind! It shows so many sides of the battle, like the people in the APU mechs trying to gun down the massive black unending Sentinels death swarms, the unfortunate people who have to navigate through the robot ridden landscape to reload ammo in these giant machines. All while this is going on we follow Zee and another character using crudely made bazookas in an attempt to shoot down huge drilling robots. All while Morpheus and Niobe, pilot a ship that has the last defense against these machines, while speeding through a narrow tunnel and being chased by millions of killer Sentinel robots. The whole sequence was jaw-dropping for me and I consider it to be the best sci-fi battle sequence, probably the best war sequence I will see in cinema for a long time.<br/><br/>Then there is the final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith. It may not be as choreographed and complex as The Burly Brawl in Reloaded, but oh man its BRUTAL! You can feel the hatred between Smith and Neo, and every punch an d kick seemed so hard I thought the theater walls were going to shatter. Then they use their superman-ish powers and fly around the place colliding into each other with amazing force! It was just one of the most brutal and surreal fights I have ever seen. It's definitely anime inspired, and I never thought they could pull off something like this with live action. Just great!<br/><br/>As far as the plot, it's all about conclusion. Most of your questions will be answered IF YOU PAY ATTENTION. But does it answer all the questions? No. Is it supposed to? No. The film doesn't need to answer all your questions, just lead you to come to your own conclusions, which is so much better than the 95% of movies that spell everything out to you. The ending may be open, and to some may seem dissatisfactory, but to me it was the only logically sound and thematically sound way to end this series.<br/><br/>Some people may complain about the dialogue. None of it made me cringe I don't know what they are talking about. Some may complain about it having a million clichés.well EVERY movie is chock full of clichés, get used to it. And as far as the acting, I can't say it's great, but then again I would nominate anyone in any franchise film series for an Oscar, whether it be Star Wars, The Matrix, or Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Actually the acting job that has always shined the brightest and should deserve some recognition is Hugo Weaving's portrayal of Agent Smith. It's a delight to watch him on screen and a delight just to hear him talk. Sometimes he's so droll and deadpan, he's almost funny, and at other times he's so deliciously sinister and evil. He's one of the most lovable movie characters to come around in years, and Hugo Weaving gets my undying gratitude for putting such character into that character.<br/><br/>So in the end The Matrix Revolutions was a fantastic ending to my favorite franchise trilogy, which will be adored by me for years to come."

They gave us more. whether you CHOOSE to embrace it is up to you."
"filmenhanceslife","3","1","2","9 November 2003"," Short of any Revolution, it Falls Back on Convention
","No one can argue with the anticipation the Matrix sequels have created. Yet after seeing the second film I was not expecting much of the third and final installment (The ending may hint at a Revolutions sequel? The Oracle may only know).  Frankly I don't usually waste my time writing reviews for movies I hate. Yet in this case, it was a rather personal letdown.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first Matrix, aside from all the pseudo philosophical garble, for its ability to be a good sci-fi, action-thriller.  But in the case of the sequels, they fall victim to melodramatic Hollywood clichés, riddled with convention and unoriginality.  Without the newness of the bullet-time photography, Matrix Revolutions becomes a bad episode of Star Trek Voyager or can I dare say, Deep Space Nine in all its gloried political correctness.  Bring on the Borg, this one was painful.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are few and far between buffered by more pseudo-philosophical Zen Nihilism asking ""What does it all mean? Where are we? What will we become?""  Blah, Blah, Blah.  ""When is this movie going to start or better yet end?"" If I wanted to spend 129 minutes debating the question of ""life and death,"" as diehard fans have suggested it so deeply touches on, I'll read some Jean Paul Sartre or take a college introductory philosophy course.  Not here, not for 6 dollars.  We get it already Andy and Larry.  You have not provided anything new to the debate.  Meanwhile go back to your video games techies. Yeah, so if you were smart enough to descramble the Anagram, ""Neo"" is the ""One"" (clever isn't it) and if you still don't get the connection (why is it called Zion again) you will be hit on the head with a 2x4 by the Christ reference.  I know you're up there Neo, I believe. To summarize my rant, I felt like I was watching a sci-fi masturbation at my, the viewer's, expense.  Whatever the brothers weren't able to include in the first Matrix due to budget concerns they squeezed into this film.  It was nothing more than a Star Wars, Star Trek, Mecwarrior tribute film.  Am I the only one that was bothered by the Mecwarriorness?!"
"bpmovies","Null","1","2","10 November 2003"," Score 10: Excellent Sci-fi Trilogy (Can you name a better one?)
","Score 10 out 10 (mostly for effort):<br/><br/>Right off the bat, can anyone name a better sci-fi trilogy? I think not. My point is this: making a great sci-fi movie is a very difficult undertaking. Making a follow up sc-fi is even more challenging. Then, pulling off a third movie on the same story, and tying it all together, is monumental indeed.<br/><br/>And the bro's have pulled the trilogy off nicely. But, this has been done mostly on hard work. The first Matrix was excellent, and most viewers who saw Revolutions would agree on that. Now combine that first movie, and all the obstacles they had to overcome (critics with microscopes, viewer over-expectations, and myopic viewers) and you have no choice but to give the bro's have an ""A"" for effort.<br/><br/>Altogether you have a movie that as one reviewer wrote, ""Has something for everyone."" The bro's told a rich philosophical sci-fi story by creating many story dialogue levels for varying intelligence levels of viewers -- a point missed by some critics. This technique was overdone a bit in Reloaded, but well synchronized in Revolutions.<br/><br/>My fellow workers and I (ok we're all mostly computer geeks at my high-tech job), enjoyed going over the movie's messages and symbols the day after we saw it.<br/><br/>This movie makes you think -- as a good sci-fi movie should.

"goosepoop357","Null","1","2","9 November 2003"," This was a good ending to a very creative and fun trilogy. 9/10 rating.
","I was apprehensive when I went in to see Matrix Revolutions. I think I liked Reloaded more than most people did, but it wasn't without its problems and I was hoping those problems had been solved in Revolutions. I was not disappointed. This review is going to focus on addressing some of the criticism that this movie has received, so be prepared.<br/><br/>I don't really need to talk about the special effects or the fight scenes because I presume that every one here will have already realized that the Matrix trilogy has set new standards in both areas, so I'll skip that aspect of the review. The acting (yes, even by Keanu Reeves) was very good. I know that many people can't separate Keanu from Ted from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, but that's their failing, not Keanu's and certainly not the failing of Revolutions.<br/><br/>One thing that people HAVE to realize/remember is that Reloaded and Revolutions are one movie. Rather than have people sit in the theatre for four hours, the Wachoski brothers decided to split it up. The effect this had on the audience was a feeling of emptiness at the end of Reloaded. Characters that had been introduced weren't expanded upon in the normal way of most other movies. But, the Matrix trilogy is somewhat unique, so it breaks out of the traditional mold of the typical movie experience. For that, I'm grateful. Too many action and sci-fi movies nowadays are meant to only visually dazzle the audience. As a result, you have poop like Star Wars: Episode One. Critics tore episode one apart on that very point. ""No plot, only eye candy which gets old very fast."" So, the Wachoski brothers decided to put some thought into their story. What has happened now is that the critics and the audience are used to seeing eye candy with no substance. So, what were the critics complaining about in Reloaded? Too much talk, not enough action to hold their attention.<br/><br/>Now I know, this is supposed to be a review about Revolutions. So, here it is. Revolutions is meant to finally fill out all the characters from the other two films, give the audience some semblance of finality and leave a few questions unanswered so the audience would still have something to speculate about after the movie was over. Since most of the characters were already known in the beginning of Revolutions, there was no need for character introduction. This lended more time to flesh out the story, which was done superbly. George Lucas should take some advice from the Wachoski brothers on how to wrap up Episode III.<br/><br/>Maybe some people like having the ENTIRE story spelled out for them, but in my experience, the talk and speculation between people on the ideas of the matrix was half the fun of the trilogy. So, if everything was spelled out, there wouldn't be the fun of speculating and formulating your own opinions concerning the Matrix.<br/><br/>More than that, I feel that this movie provided more closure for the trilogy than most other on-going movie series such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Indiana Jones and the like.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, I thought that Revolutions had much of the same wonderment as the first movie, the action of the second movie, and more story than either of its predecessors while answering several questions from the first two movies. Revolutions demands more of its audience than the usual empty, mass produced, cookie cutter action/sci-fi movie that Hollywood usually puts out. That's why the Matrix Trilogy will most certainly stand the test of time and delight audiences years from now. This movie wasn't without its problems, but if you're going to go into this movie expecting it to follow the usual hollywood, cookie-cutter ""third film"", you'll hopefully be pleasantly surprised. Revolutions transcends the confines of the mass-produced hollywood movie. It provides the eye candy while getting your brain involved."
"evil_demon","10","1","2","9 November 2003"," Matrix Revolutions and Philosophy ???
","I hope that most of you realize that Matrix trilogy was made for the masses and Wachovski brothers made sure that there is something for everybody, some action for people who like ""Terminator 3""-like movies, some love drama for the people who want to see another ""Titanic"" movie and a little bit of philosophy. Well, I was interested in the philosophy part but was bitterly disappointed from the very beginning and Matrix 1! Thus, I was not surprised that M2 and M3 were purely commercial and had no actual meaning besides the action and drama. What Wachovski brothers tried to do is to commercialize and make popular a very old phiospohical idea, expressed by Rene Descartes in his method of doubt and summarized in his famous sentence: ""Cogito ergo sum"". For those of you who believe that Matrix philosophy is ORIGINAL, no it is definitely NOT original, you were just sleeping in your philosophy classes in college then.... actually this philosophy is expressed in a rather tasteless manner in the Matrix trilogy. From a technical viewpoint the movie was just nonsense, I say this as a computer scientist. By the way, does anybody remember a movie called ""13th Floor"", it came out a month or two before M1, it started with ""Cogito ergo sum"" and had the same idea as Matrix 1, expressed without action and Keanu Reeves. So, go and see it. To cut the long story short, if you've liked Matrix 3 and believe that it is original, sophisticated and philosophical, better watch more ""Terminator 3""-like movies and have fun ! If you still like Matrix 3 but were puzzled by its plotholes and nonsense, then find ""Discourse on Method, Meditations on the First Philosophy"" by Rene Descartes and read it + watch ""13th Floor"". Greetings!"

","It makes me a little sad to see how jaded some of you ""critics"" have become. After reading a lot of bad reviews on this web site I had lowered my expectations and braced myself before I went to see this movie. I was totally prepared for disappointment.  Instead, what I got was a treat in the form of one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen! I kept waiting for the part that turned everyone off and inspired all the hostile reviews and it just never happened.  All I saw was amazing visuals, a fun story that wrapped up nicely at the end. The ending was great in that it does not spell everything out for you. It does leave a little room for speculation at the end.  The studio probably insisted that it be left slightly open ended in case they just had to make another sequel, but it's still good because the way it is makes you think about it long after it is over. Also, people compare it to the original and say it is not as good. Okay, but keep in mind the first one had the advantage of being new and mysterious.  Now we have seen what is behind the curtain so the mystery is gone. Now we need to see how the story plays out, and man does it ever! Maybe people just don't understand it, or they just wanted to see something other than what they saw. I don't know. For those of you who don't get it, sorry. I would love to see you do something better, or even remotely close! You are really missing out by keeping your mind closed!  I know I am not alone when I say to the Wachowski bros ""BRAVO!!"". I plan to go back and see it again soon, as with the other two films, repeat viewings bring about a deeper understanding and appreciation. Hopefully I can catch on IMAX also! For those of you who aren't trying to be movie critics, you're going to love it!! I know I did!"

","This movie is vastly different from its predecessor, The Matrix.  The formula in the first movie was a balance of interesting plot with great action and special effects.  Most of the plot in the first movie was very deep and philisophical if you wanted to be, or you could take it at face value.  An excellent movie to think and think upon for weeks to come.  The special effects were awesome.<br/><br/>Reloaded was a very deep storyline which turned off many of the non-hardcore viewers.  The first time watching this movie left lots of questions to think on.  I was 10 minutes behind thinking about things that I missed the action. As well, Mr. Smith had too many cheesey sayings.  Not to mention, the fight scenes were way over the top.  Fighting 100 Mr. Smiths was quite boring and I was just waiting for it to end.  And it ended poorly.<br/><br/>I'm not as excited to see Revolutions now that I have seen this edition. I'll see it at some point, but I may wait for video.

Also, the x-tian intonation is so overwhelming that it shoots pain across the front of your brain. Too bad Mystery Science Theater doesn't exist anymore. They'd have had a blast with this one.

"roge0231","10","1","2","9 November 2003"," do NOT bash this film!
","I believe that the random bashings of this film are uncalled for....People need to realize the greatness of this film.  Sure, the fight scenes may be a bit longer than anyone would have hoped for, but one must realize the reason this is so.  The Wachowski brothers created an epic trilogy, in my opinion, possibly even rivaling the great Star Wars, but then again, what do I know, I'm only 19 right?  The thing is, the brothers invented/created so many new things in the world of technology just for this trilogy.  Not only did they successfully pull off the 360 degree angle camera shot, but the massive car chase in Reloaded had NUMEROUS camera riggings that were created and used by the producers and cameramen/women.  After seeing the original Matrix when it first came out, I wished it had not ended, and to my great anticipation, the brothers introduced their 2nd and 3rd films within a year of eachother. I have read several commentaries on this movie and Reloaded and neither of them do it justice.  The great thing about this movie and how it focused on the attack on Zion for the majority of the movie is the fact that you spend so much time hoping that the inhabitants of Zion can defeat the Squiddies and at the same time, forget that Neo, the ONE, is still out there and trying to end the war all together.  Once you think the city of Zion has been saved to an extent, it starts all over again, but leaves you hanging by switching to Neo in the Machine world.  I only found 2 things in this entire movie to be somewhat disappointing.  When Neo talks to ""Deus Ex Machina"" (the machine face made of tiny machines) seems a bit out of the ordinary. I understand that at this point anything can happen, but it just seemed kind of goofy.  The other thing was the fight scene between Smith and Neo at the end.  It simply went back and forth and you got a bit sick of it, but when the final part of that scene took place, it ended everything, in fact, it ended the reign of Smith all together, but it took its sweet time. THESE, are the only two faults I find with any of the movies.  Granted Trinity, the greatest character besides Neo himself (oh and that hot chick that was with Zee and the Bazooka), died and made even the biggest Matrix buffs cry, that only made the movie better, the fact that Neo continued on without her and gave the movie just enough romance, so as not to disappoint the movie buffs. All in all, If I were Ebert and Roepert, I would have given this movie and the trilogy itself, 2 thumbs WAY WAY up plus my big toes too.  The ending only made the movies greater......."
"BTRALover100","1","1","2","9 November 2003"," Why does the last movie in a trilogy have to stink?
","I've only got 1000 words even though 10000 would be needed, so I'll limit myself to logical flaws in this series at first.  In fact, the only way to do the flaws justice would be to spend this entire space going off on one flaw and letting everyone know that there are about 100 others that just keep building as you go from the first masterpiece to the third piece of garbage.  I saw the movie for free and still almost walked out.  The first movie was so clear in concept, sly in its adherence to a Biblical Messiah story interpretation, creative in special effects, et., but the writers just gave up on vision and went for money as the movies progressed.  Either that or they just lost their touch as seen so prevalently with George Lucas.<br/><br/>
Let's just tear apart the one flaw that really could have been changed for the better.  I'll leave the other 100 flaws for others.  Wait, there is one flaw that I'll hit real quick before hitting the other.  150,000 sentinals against about 1000 slow, machine gun toting juggernaughts.  For some unknown reason, there are no more EMP's at the base.  Any moron would know that doesn't make sense, even if they had sent every single hovercraft out on the failed intercept mission, which also would have been stupid.  Anyway, the battle should have lasted about 1 minute or less, but had to go on for 30 minutes like a long drawn out kung fu theatre sequence that was more for the purpose of dance and show than for sense.  Machines were just flying around like schools of fish rather than attacking in any intelligent way.  Even when they took out the leader, they all (at least 100) went at him in a single file.  About 10 coming from different directions at the same time could have taken him out.  And why not use the lasers?  O.K., may they were programmed to be cruel and slash things to death.  And why only one drill came through in the beginning.  We saw at least 3-4 in the second movie. Did they disappear like the mystery EMP's?<br/><br/>O.K., back to my other point.<br/><br/>At the end of part 2 when Neo stopped the sentinals, I was really hoping that they would go with the most plausible explanation, that the real world was in fact just another faction of the matrix.  In that way, the choices that were belabored in part 2 would only be on false pretenses.  I suppose that this concept could still be a possibility, and in fact, may be the only one if we assume that a program such as Smith can traverse the two worlds. Neo could have been the first One to have recognized the pattern.  In fact, perhaps he is the first one to self-actualize out of the double matrix and into the real world by his final sacrifice.  It surely would make the tag line make more sense.  Sure, it splits completely from the Messiah story they started with, but it takes it into a new realm that was only touched on by The Thirteenth Floor and other movies.  Imagine the possibilities.  The messiah could then form peace in the real real world and release the humans into the paradise that the real real world may be now that machines have been in control of for so long.  Machine control linked to Satan influence on Earth.  Yada Yada, we've now gone deep into philosophical contexts. That would have been cool.  But alas, they decided to just give him the ability to blow up sentinals.  O.K., just how did this happen?  Why did this happen? In what plausible way does the ability to program in the Matrix parlay into the ability to blow up in the real world.  Alright, so that wasn't his only power.  He could also see things while blind.  But now he can only see machine world items.  Once again, making no sense.  We could try to make sense by saying that he was somehow seeing energy patterns and that maybe his blowing up of sentinals ability was related to his new sense of electric fields.  But wait, he was seeing more than that, like the floor.  Was there energy in everything in the machine world?  Must have been I guess?  And apparently, Neo could see them, and make them blow up.  But even after they kill his woman, he decides that rather then use that power to just blow everything up, he'll save humanity.  That's about the only time in the movie he wasn't sucking on a bottle being told what to do at least.<br/><br/>List of other problems 1 - The machines don't need us for power.  This is obvious, although the architect and the humans seem oblivious to the fact.  I won't even get into the biophysics of it, but clearly, if the machines are so advanced and so ahead of humans as eluded to in the Animatrix, they could do it.  Perhaps the keep us around as part of their programming.  A fail-safe inability to completely irradicate humans.  But that is what they were in the process of doing.  Maybe they just hate us.  If so, why not just kill us and use another power source that caused less problems?  O.K., they just hate us. But then, why keep their bargain with Neo?  O.K., they hate us, and they can't lie, even to us.  Sure, why not?<br/><br/>2 - Neo destroyed the something at the end of part 2, but it must not have been the Matrix since people were still popping in and out of it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>3 - What in the world was the purpose of the train station?  I know what they told us was the purpose, but why would they need something to move programs in and out of the Matrix.  It's called I/O and they should have been able to do it at the speed of light.  And exactly what were they coming to or from?  One was the Matrix, and one was the real world, which I guess was the mainframe, but apparently, this all powerful mainframe can be fooled by a train station program.  I don't even know what I'm saying anymore because none of it made sense.  And even though Neo can blow up Sentinals and reprogram the Matrix, he has no power whatsoever in the train station. Sure, why not.<br/><br/>4 - I'm sure I'm out of space by now."

","I was bored to tears in this movie.  I saw it in the Imax, and after seeing it was asked ""How were the effects?"" to which I responded ""Visually stunning... but so what""<br/><br/>The main fight between zion and robots was TOO MUCH.  It would have been much more interesting with less robots and more interesting characters. Tanks replacement did nothing but occupy the space Tank would have used. To Morpheus and Jada Pinkett Smith... thanks for keeping the bench warm.  To Monica Belluci, is it possible to have less screen time than the last one? Smith was boring as well as without ANY reality in a fight, how interesting can it be.<br/><br/>This movie had two interesting characters, the guy in the subway and the guy Neo fights in the smaller ship.  ( I am being deliberately vague to avoid any spoilers)<br/><br/>After reloaded, which was a complete letdown, I had moderately low expectations which it failed to deliver.<br/><br/>One critic I read above said that this was the third act of one movie. Like too many hollywood movies, the first act is the most interesting as that is where the characters are developed and discover their abilities.  The third act is typically where the studio sells out with a ridiculous over-the top finale.<br/><br/>About as exciting as watching someone else play Galaga for an hour... Save your money."
"MaKaVeLi_dtl","10","1","2","9 November 2003"," Just Another Useless Thought...
","Anyone else think that the last two Matrix movies would have been done more justice if the titles of M2 and M3 had been switched?  In M2 was the Matrix ever ""Reloaded"" in M2, or were we were merely introduced to the concept? I think it was more about the people of Zion coming together to revolt against the machines.  Remember that great speech that Morpheus gave to the people of Zion, is that not the beginning of the ""Revolution"" against the machines? And in M3, sure there was a revolution but wasn't the message about the peace brought to, both, the people of Zion and the Machines because of the efforts of Neo and, subsequently, the matrix being ""reloaded.""<br/><br/>For those people that can not see past the ""Good guy beats bad guy, and everyone lives happily ever after"" theme and were disappointed, too bad because The Matrix trilogy had a deeper meaning than that.  And I think it's the people that understood that meaning who thoroughly enjoyed the trilogy for what it was and what it meant."
"stressfulcow2002","10","1","2","9 November 2003"," By far the best of the three!
","Not only does this adequately end The Matrix saga, it very quickly ties up most of the loose ends in Reloaded, to get on to the more important stuff. The epic battle sequence actually seems short, despite it being 25 minutes. It does leave a little up for discussion, but all in all it is a really great film."
"kamikazeboy","10","1","2","9 November 2003"," 2nd to Matrix
","Revolutions far surpasses the bench mark set by the already hugely critisiced Reloaded. Although neither two sequels barely reach the standard of the first movie, the Matrix, Revolutions indicates why this trilogy is looked upon as a new way of filmmaking; imitated countlessly in movies like charlie's angels, shrek, etc. The Wachowskis have drew a good deal of not making any public appearences for promoting the movies. This obvious reason of no-shows is largely due to the fact that they do not want to be questioned on the inner and more deeper meaning of the films. They have conjured up different themes like Christianity, bible, philosophy, life and death, choices, etc. Picking up styles from David Lynch films, the Wachowskis deliberate story lines is meant to question the audiences. As a result, different conclusions and theories have popped up in countless forums (1 topic every 30 seconds in ****.com If this film has freely guided audiences to what it was trying to say, what's the fun of watching the matrixes then?<br/><br/>Revolutions starts off where reloaded left, showing no compation to those who missed reloaded, as characters are not formaly introduced like new movies do. Neo is left in a coma after stopping sentinels at the end of reloaded, and is trapped in a place between the world of the machines, and the world of zion. There, he meets a new and fairly important character, Sati, who's parents are programmes with purposes. I will refrain from going deeper into the plot to avoid spoilers. Though Revolutions has less screen time for any individual characters, the Wachowskis manage to execute a pace that keeps the movie going as it should be. With great visual effects and expert choreography by Yuen Wo-Ping, the actions sequences are nothing less than amazing. the highlights include a 40 minute battle sequence of zion, that most expected to happen in Reloaded, and the final battle between Neo and Smith, aka Good vs. Evil. The final fight has mixed every culture of 'final battle' scenes in movie history; thunder storm, pouring rain, empty roads, and great music. Dosen't fall short of the kind of poetry in motion that has captivated audiences in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.<br/><br/>
Overall, and excellent film in terms of story line, visuals, sound. The brothers should have an oscar contention for the final film, if not, nothing less than an achievement awards will be much obliged."

","Guys did a great job - how it is possible from a perfect first movie make such a terrible ending. I think, better they did not make this movie.

"JB Martin","9","1","2","9 November 2003"," Where's the Revolution?
","This final installment of the ""Matrix"" trilogy is nothing short of disappointing.  It has the visual marvel of ""The Matrix"" and ""Reloaded"", but lacks the philosophy and heady dialogue of the first two.  As mentioned, the first film is about birth, the second about life, and the third about death. It's unfortunate that ""Revolutions"" is about death in more ways than one."

"alectrevelyan006","10","1","2","8 November 2003"," Trippy film
","To be honest, the MATRIX RELOADED disappointed me a little bit, but pleased me quite much. Everyone has heard or seen by now how the special effects of that film look fake in crucial areas. But when it comes to the MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, obviously they had more time to fix any flaws present. It's more ""mindless action,"" should I say. Revolutions is a great film, although it might not have ended the way alot of people thought it would have. I love the Matrix trilogy. And when I sat through this film, it made perfect sense. When it came to the end I was a bit puzzled, but I soon found out what the purpose of film 2 was for film 3 to happen. The movie could not have ended any other way that it was intended to. The Wachowski brothers weren't allowed to film these three films back to back. If that were the case, we might have gotten different looking films. Anyway, what I'm tryin to say is that these films should not be TOTALLY judged in a philosophical sense, or even a literal sense, because in the end, we are watching Sci-Fi/Fantasy flicks. Although the first film tried to be as perfect as possible, we have to come to realize, nothing in this world can be ultimately perfect. A film is NOT ultimately created for the sake of ""changing your life,"" but more to ""entertain and stimulate your senses."" That's my 2 cents.<br/><br/>AWESOME TRILOGY, GO OUT AND WATCH IT IF YOU HAVEN'T. Overall Rating: Rating A-"

I mean sure most of the third film was kind of average but it did have it's moments and i think answers a lot of quetions. Plus the special effects and new ideas created are well above anything thats been done before. Sure the dialogue could have been better, but that doesn't take away the fact that the plot is brilliant. The best thing about it by far is the fight secne at the end between Neo and Agent Smith.

","CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS: With that sweet opening and all that humor, you'd think that everything in the Matrix trilogy would turn out perfect. Well, I guess not. WHY DID THIS HAVE TO BE A TRAGEDY! Trinity and Neo were so wonderful that I cried when they died. But the truth is, I don't even know if Neo died, you can't really tell. It's not like anyone tells you...<br/><br/>But putting aside the tramatic ending, the movie is really awesome. The fight between Neo and Agent Smith is something out of this world. The graphics are amazing and sometimes, you wish you were there to see it yourself.But it's silly how Neo wins by giving up...<br/><br/>The unique music of the Matrix is hard to copy. When you look through your list of songs, unless you know exactly the type of music they use, it's hard to find something like it. The great beats and industrial/techno feel is invigorating.<br/><br/>And I must say that Trinity looks her best in this film. Carrie's acting is wonderful and you feel her love when she's dying. Once again, she gets sleek, sexy outfits that all girls wish they could wear!<br/><br/>
And Niobe rocks as well. She's such a cool looking person!<br/><br/>Neo does some great comedy in this movie to lighten up the mood, especially when he's stuck in the trainstation.<br/><br/>Overall, with the exception of the end, the movie is entertaining thoroughly and I plan on watching it over and over again, but skipping the last half hour of so of course. No one likes to see the heroes die!<br/><br/>Definitely a ten!"

I'm not particularly religious, but this trilogy is like a furturistic look at the bible, in a sense...  a computer-geek look at the bible if you will, lol<br/><br/>The one and only complaint I have (which can be said about many multi-part movies) is that they blow all the cool new special effects in the first movie...  bullet time, etc etc was introduced in the first movie, and all of you went into the last two movies expecting a new, outstanding effect or CGI or whatever.  Out of the three, as far as effects go, I have to say that the first one is obviously the best as it introduced all the new effects, then Revolutions (I failed to see any blaring bad CGI, nor did they over-use any of the effects...) and then Reloaded (the Smiths vs Neo fight had some blaring mistakes and bad CGI in it, though the fight was definately cool.)<br/><br/>I feel bad for all of you that either hate #2 and #3, or just don't get it...  because I GET IT and it makes me feel good that not only that I get it, but that I enjoyed it.  I can't change your minds, but I am here to offer my perspective on it all if you want to send me a message, I will respond to it...  you have questions, I will answer in my own perspective.

","Don't get me wrong.  I am a fan of the first Matrix film, because it was simply a very good action film.  With the sequels, the Wachowski bros have obviously travelled so far up their own behinds in searching for some cod-philosophy and religious imagery to fill them up with, they have forgotten about such minor details as plot, character development, and scriptwriting.<br/><br/>Matrix Reloaded at least had that car chase and some 'in the matrix' action in between the rubbish Zion storyline.  Unfortunately, Matrix Revolutions is just boring.  The invasion of Zion looks fairly good, but is badly directed and lacks any excitement or coherence whatsoever.  The worst thing though is the dialogue, which ranges from the simplistic at best, to laughably bad at other points.  As with Matrix Reloaded there are a number of pointless incomprehensible monologues as well.<br/><br/>Not everything that has a beginning has a total cop-out ending."
"hl_21","1","1","2","8 November 2003"," AWFUL!
","This is the worst movie of the Matrix series and one of the worst I have ever seen. The first Matrix was a combination of sci-fi, suspense and with incredible action, making it one of my favorite movies and of many people. Reloaded had cool scenes like the chase secuence and cool fighting scenes, but it had a lack of argument and story, but I still liked it. Matrix Revolutions was just terrible, it didnt have action,(maybe some like when they fight the machines but it wasnt good), but at least I expected a good closure for the series. But oh no, we dont get any answers and it isnt one of those movies that leaves you wondering like 2001:space odyssey, but it just feels that you got rip off, and you feel disappointed. BEGINNING OF SPOILER SECTION. What the heck with the ending? After a Dragon Ball Z fight which wasnt cool at all, Neo gets defeated and suddenly without any explication a beam of light makes him dissappear and makes dissappear all the Agent Smiths, saving the world and makin peace and a happy ending =). What the hell??? This was the incredible endind? No way. Besides the whole movie stinks, the scene when Trinity dies wasnt emotional at all, I was just desperate they stop talking and just die at once. A guy in the move theater was just snoring in a jokly manner, but it was true, it was very boring. END OF SPOILER SECTION. This movie just sucks, I still love the first Matrix and like scenes in the Reloaded(Although the chase scene in Terminator 3 was much entretaining)but this movie doesnt have anything I like it is just a waste of more than 2 hours and money, if you want to see it to know how the Matrix will end, go ahead you may like it like some of my friends I went out with to see it, but I think you may go out feeling angry at the Wachoswki brothers and very very disappointed.

"annamariajackson","1","1","2","7 November 2003"," Ruins the legacy of the Original (Spoilers)
","I'll start by saying I'm a huge HUGE fan of both the original Matrix, and Reloaded. In those, the Wachowski Brothers successfully blended original special effects and beautiful, talented actors with philosophy, religion, and literature, creating a movie that could be enjoyed by people with IQs from 50 to 170. That having been said, this 'final' installment was nothing more then obvious pandering to every Billy-Joe-Bob who cares for nothing but the same old hat. Gone are the mind twisting philosophical speeches, the religious overtones, the character depth, the sly literary references: in short, everything that made this movie special and different in the first place. Instead, Morpheus has been reduced to (literally) a tv-sitcom naggy backseat driver, Trinity's fight scenes are glaringly obviously cobbled together from those in the original movie, the Merovingian has become just another brooding second bad guy type with five pointless minutes of screen time, and Smith is every maniacal, insane meglomaniac we've seen in countless other less-worthy action flicks. We're forced to cringe through rehash after rehash of the special effects that everyone raved over in the first two films (the Trinty Eagle, the Dock APUs, the burly brawl), and a few more thrown in and repeated ad nauseum (the water bubble - FOUR times) until one realizes that this franchise has obviously sold out the the Hollywood ""bigger and more expensive is better"" sequel generator. Neo is no longer the savior, the One; he's become Bruce Willis from the Diehard flicks. Trinty is a Bond Girl. The Matrix was a fabulous movie, a total mind trip, a ""thinking man's"" action movie. I'm not sure it needed a sequel, and I originally had misgivings about the followups. While Reloaded was a little less perfect, it still retained much of the original's freshness, and I liked the direction they appeared to be going in (the Smith Virus and the Architect program). It seems that they dropped the ball somewhere between May and November - was there a meeting somewhere along the line in which it was mentioned that ""people thought Morpheus' and the Architect's speeches were boring"" and ""those Aliens looking machine things went over really good, use more of those.""? I would have loved some really in-depth continuation of the virus plot (especially with Bane), or some background on the relationship between the Oracle, the Merovingion, and the Architect. I even would have liked just some smaller concessions, a fight between Sereph and Smith, another scene of faith-inspired Morpheus addressing Zion, or the Merovngion twisting a few more programs around to maintain his empire. I might even have settled for a good old fashion ""we've planted the bombs and will blow up the machine city in 10, 9..."". Anything would have been better then what we got. Basically two big CGI fight scenes and ""oh yeah, we'll cease hostilities after years of war, and destroying your civilization four times before, not a problem"". Sadly, this movie looks like just any other pitiful sequel with an overly large special effects budget and no writers. (And with what Reloaded had left it with, it shouldn't have been.) The beginning was absolutely pointless, the kung-fu fights were uninspired and too effects laden, the Dock battle was too long, and the ending was a cop out. All the leads look tired, and in a few scenes Carrie-Ann Moss looked positively ready to be over and done with this character and get on with being pregnant and motherhood (props to Carrie-Ann!) In addition, the list of minor gripes: I hope Monica Bellucci got to keep that marvelous wonder-bra in addition to a big fat paycheck - what a waste her screen time was. How sad that Morpheus has been reduced from secondary savior and faith-guru (John the Baptist and Simon Peter if you will) of Zion to co-pilot. Apparently white girls in Zion have really bad hair. As always, if you are the general's right hand man you're going to go down fighting and die imparting wisdom to the new recruit. If you burn someone in the face, only their eyesockets will be affected. The dock doors, which we're lead to believe have repelled machines for years, can be destroyed by a ship that can be destroyed by machines. Taking off your sweater makes you fly better (what, she was worried about more snags?) The Oracle can change shapes but always has to be an older black woman. They apparently wasted a lot of their time in the second film, the Merovingion can be threatened successfully with just a gun to his head. Neo's clothing metamorphosis was a subtle hint at his character evolution; why is he back in the priest's garb in the super burly-brawl? What happened to Sereph's magical hallway key? And my biggest minor gripe: Neo, originally machine Energizer battery, then the One chosen basically to help control the pest (Zion) population, and finally Mr. Norton Anti-Virus, carried off through the machine city on his stately funeral barge of glory?! Whatever. I actually have a dozen more of these but I think you get the point. There were a few decent parts, on which I'll elaborate instead. While most of the acting was underdone, it was almost saved completely by Ian Bliss and Mary Alice. They each managed to capture the EXACT nuances of the other actors their characters were based on. Bliss says 'Mr. Anderson' almost as well as Hugo Weaving, but it was the characteristic moves of his head and body that were pinpoint accurate and really stood out. The same for Mary Alice, who even managed to hold a cigarette exactly like Gloria Foster. Wow. The idea of flipping the vampire-like programs in Hell to the ceiling for the fight was inspired. The Merovingion eating a green and red olive while Persephone sits next to him in red and olive green was cute. I was happy to finally see just why Niobe was a ship captain; I was starting to think it was just because she dated high ranking men. All in all, I retain my love of the first two, and my respect for the Wachowski Brothers, as well as Fishburne, Moss, and Reeves. But I feel like The Matrix Revolutions was a poor poor ending to this fabulous trilogy, a complete waste of getting up early to see it (yep, I went to the first show), a huge disappointment to the fans, a waste of a lot of somebody's bankroll, and quite frankly, a foul piece of cinamagraphic tripe.

And if that's the good stuff I'd hate to see what is crap. So if you really liked or loved the 2nd one your not really a true fan of what the matrix is so go see the 3rd you'll be happy. If you didn't like the 2nd you'll just as much not like the 3rd. So skip it and buy or rent the Animatrix its better than those movies combined. Here's hoping that.

","I still hate the ambiguous ending, still hate that the movie's main character is missing through half the movie and there's barely any kung fu but someone here suggested that if you weren't sure if you liked it or not to go see it again. Excellent recommendation! <br/><br/>I can see why people think it's better than the second now. And alot of questions that I had were answered upon second viewing. One of my questions being why didn't the dock use their own EMP? Well, because they didn't have one and they mention that fact during the coming battle.<br/><br/>It's just a really good movie. Sure, it's corny but somehow it works. I don't know why. And Keanu still breaks my heart when he's crying. If that wasn't real then I don't know what is. Most actors when called on to cry don't sob they sort of whine. I'd be amazed to find out that he was just acting and hadn't pulled some horrible memory up for the moment. The scene wouldn't have been so sad without his actions.<br/><br/>Hopefully the stupid critics won't cause people to drop off from viewings in the coming weeks. I haven't seen any movie that made me think as much as this trilogy did. Anytime you're affected by a story so much that it stays with you even after the movie is long gone is a movie worth watching.<br/><br/>So, give it a break, go see it again and remember, the Matrix has you and that none of this stuff can really happen - at this time at least - it's scifi/fantasy. IT'S NOT REAL!! Once you can accept that, you can begin to enjoy it for what it is, a fantastic story!<br/><br/>My first vote was an 8 out of 10 but I'm giving it a 10 now even though I can't go back and fix my choice. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!"
"eamon-hennedy","10","1","2","10 November 2003"," Frustrating, But Ultimately Brilliant.
","*****CONTAINS SPOILERS*****<br/><br/>As a devoted fan of The Matrix trilogy I waited for baited breath for the final installment. I had loved both The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded and I was dying to know how the Wachowski's would wrap up what has been a fantastic and entertaining slice of science fiction cinema. What we get is an action packed extravaganza that is undeniably brilliant, but at the same time very frustrating. Allow me to elaborate.<br/><br/>You see The Matrix Revolutions promises answers. Joel Silver and the cast promised that this would wrap up the series once and for all and while many core elements of the story do conclude, such as the war between man and machine, the elaboration of what happened to Bane, the link between Smith and Neo, many of the character arcs are left in the air too much. For example, what happens to Neo. Does he die after destroying the multiple Smiths after their fierce battle? Why are the machines taking his body away? If he is dead what do they plan to do with him, likewise for if he is alive? Then there is Persephone? What happened when she kissed Neo is Reloaded? We never found out as she only appears in one scene and says one line. Also frustrating is how little the main characters have to do with the battle itself. Morpheus, Link, Niobe, Ghost, Sparks, Roland and his crew are battling to get back to Zion and are not immediately caught up with the battle, instead being the ones who temporarily save the day. Likewise Neo and Trinity. Instead they are on their way to Machine City. None of the main characters have much to do with the dominant story arcs, save for Neo of course. Morpheus is literally in the back seat while all Trinity gets to do throughout the bulk of the movie is guide Neo and then die.<br/><br/>It may sound like I'm one of the band of people who did not like this movie but I assure you I am not. The battle sequence is superb. The sight of hundreds of thousands of sentinels swarming into Zion and engaging in battle against the APU's is superb cinema and a sequence that demands a viewing on the largest screen. The sequences in the Merovingian's S&M club, Club Hell are fantastic also. The henchman running on the ceiling while Trinity, Morpheus and Seraph shoot them down brings to mind the Government Lobby sequence from the first film. Then there is the final fight. Neo versus Smith. Fantastic. The extreme nature of the special effects as buildings are destroyed and Neo and Smith fight against a thunder clouded sky are awesome sights and show that this is truly a classic trilogy. <br/><br/>My only gripe is that the Wachowski's have left maybe too much for the audience to decide, the biggest one being regarding Neo's fate. He has been the center of this journey, the story in effect filtering through Neo so it is heartbreaking that we never know what happens to him. That aside, the directorial touches from Larry and Andy are masterful as always, the performances from all are superb (Trinity's death scene is handled fantastically by Carrie Anne Moss and Keanu Reeves and Fishburne and Weaving are stand outs as usual) while Don Davis' music score is quite simply one of the finest committed to film. The mixture of pounding orchestra and chorus choir is fantastic to hear and is a classic piece of movie music.<br/><br/>Overall Larry and Andy have given us a sight to behold, a magic piece of cinema that I am sure many will never forget."

","The first movie was excellent The ANIMATRIX was excellent RELOADED was bad Revolutions was worse<br/><br/>Revolutions is like a corpse that died sometime after 1999. It is full of holes and rotten material...and the result is it stinks really bad. Except for Mr. Fishburne, it has some of the worst acting in recent memory. It has needless fight sequences to satisfy the teenagers. It has illogical and unintelligent plot that makes ARMEGEDDON seem like a work of art. Well, not quite. Here is what the Wachowski's were thinking after the first film came out:<br/><br/>L-we've got lots of money now, let's make more!<br/><br/>A-how?<br/><br/>L-lets hire lots more people and make sequels!<br/><br/>A-YEAH, what should we put in them?<br/><br/>L-more senseless violence and pointless choreographed fights.<br/><br/>A-YEAH<br/><br/>L-more weapons and vehicles, so they can make toys and we can play with<br/><br/>them.<br/><br/>A-YEAH<br/><br/>L-a huge orgy in a temple<br/><br/>A-YEAH YEAH YEAH<br/><br/>L-more agent smiths, 100's of them<br/><br/>A-YEAH<br/><br/>L-more useless dialog about philosophy that makes us sound smart.<br/><br/>A-Uh, YEAH<br/><br/>L-Let's direct a video game<br/><br/>A-But we're film directors?<br/><br/>L-Doesn't matter, the game can be complete crap. As long as the box says matrix, it will make lots of money<br/><br/>A-I LIKE IT<br/><br/>L-Quick, let's make up more names for the new characters, like Samsung, Whirlpool, Mitsubishi, Zenith...........<br/><br/>This movie, the end of a trilogy, should have tied together the story and had a sense of closure. I wanted to see more of the machine's side of things. How did Neo's sacrifice affect them, and why did they stop their attack. I wanted to know why Neo could suddenly blow things up. I wanted to know why, if there's sunlight right above the clouds, the machines couldn't build solar towers and kill all the human batteries. I wanted to know why all of the agent smiths didn't attack Neo at the end, instead of only one. I wanted to know why programs choose to look like Colonel Sanders and Aunt Jemima. Most of all, I want to know how and why directors such as the Wachowskis and Lucas start such great sagas and then destroy them.<br/><br/>Never have I been so disappointed by a motion picture. The only way I could be more disappointed is if the next Conan movie was this bad. Guess who's slated to direct it- The Wachowski's."

","`If we shadows have offended, think but this, and all is mended. That you have but slumbered here, while these visions did appear, and this weak and idle theme, no more yielding but a dream. Gentles, do not reprehend. If you pardon, we will mend. And as I'm an honest Puck, if you have unearned luck, now to scape the serpent's tongue, we shall make amends ere long. Give me your hands, if we be friends, and Robin shall restore amends.'<br/><br/>I wanted to write a long thing about The Matrix Trilogy. I wanted to really get lost in its mythology, its characters, the style it uses, the art, the story, symbolisms, references and all the stuff that makes my brain go all gooey when I get into geek mode. I wanted to try and convey how much I loved and still love all of the movies and the mythology built up around it. And I wanted to try and explain to you, how much this series has meant to me, my craft and my future doings.<br/><br/>But I won't.<br/><br/>I won't because quite frankly it isn't worth the effort. I could write a book about it and it wouldn't make a lick of difference because the verdict is in and it's not looking good. At least not to the favor of The Matrix. In fact it looks like a deliberate lynching.<br/><br/>And I don't understand why.<br/><br/>I count myself in 'the know' when it comes to movies. This is no casual relationship. No kiss on the cheek every once in a while for the sake of a nights entertainment. This is hardcore f***ing, the kind that leaves scars, bruises and momentary memory loss. I don't just 'like' movies, I f***ing love them. I breathe them and soak myself in them. I think through them and talk like them.<br/><br/>And while comparisons of this and that could be made, comparing it to art, music, history, philosophy, religion etc. I won't play charades. I love movies because they give me context and pleasure. That's it. That's all there is to it.<br/><br/>When I was a kid I first saw the likes of Cameron's classics The Terminator and Aliens. I am sure that many if you had the same experience as me, in that these movies, like the Star Wars trilogy, somehow managed to live on inside your head. They transported us into that dropship and into that trench. They made us fight for our lives and dream of a world where our lives had a meaning; the fight for freedom.<br/><br/>What I saw on that screen Wednesday night was the logical conclusion to that childhood dream. It was all that I had built up since I was a kid, and to me it was all that that I had made it up to be. This was it, the dark future. This was where mankind had to make its last stand against the machines, the aliens and all the other nasty things that go 'klang' in the night.<br/><br/>This had all the fear, desperation, hatred, love and pure kinetic energy that I would ever had expected from it. This was the trench run of A New Hope, the Hoth battle from Empire, the race to the core of the Deathstar from Jedi, the last 20 minutes of Terminator, the last 40 minutes of T2, the last stand in Aliens, the opening of Saving Private Ryan, Bits and pieces of The Longest Day and so on, all rolled up into one.<br/><br/>When I see the complete picture of everything that The Matrix currently encompasses I see a fantastic canvas of modern science-fiction. And I wish I could show that canvas to the people who don't appreciate it in the same way that I do. I wish I could make you see; make you appreciate what this is, what significance this has. But that's like explaining the punch line of an in-joke; it'll destroy the intention.<br/><br/>I have a few regrets. First of all I wish I had someone to share my joy with. I think I blinked three times while in the cinema, my knuckles where white from clenching my legs and my smile was pretty much chiseled in concrete the rest of the night. I wish I could share that with my friends.<br/><br/>Secondly I wish that the average reviewer put as much back, sweat and tears into their work as I do when I get really worked up. I spent probably around 5-6 hours writing the Kill Bill entry from the other day, and it's not even a finished piece. Having shuffled through tens and tens of online reviews I think I can safely say that some of these 'reviewers' failed to spend more than 5-10 minutes on their 'reviews'. And that's including the résumé of the movie, as pointless as that is. Should they do that, then perhaps they would find that they can discover new things about the movies through writing. When I walked out of the cinema from watching Kill Bill I was pretty non-plussed, it took a lot of consideration to reach my final conclusion and it took some determination to reach the final entry. All I ask of them is to love movies as much as their readers. Or weave the space for someone who does. That is if nothing else, the only reason why I still have some respect for Ain't It Cool News. At least it's genuine.<br/><br/>Oh yes. One more thing. If I see one more pun with the use of 're'-something or the use of such idiotic terms as Wa-chew-ski (as in `They bit off more than they could Wa-chew-ski'), then I don't know what I'll do. It pains me to know that these peoples opinions are taken seriously and that they often actually receive payment for what they do.<br/><br/>The Matrix franchise was never a series that aimed for the general public. Magically it managed to become a raging success and that led people to believe that this was a movie for them. Well it wasn't. It's for us. It's for the people who love the poses, the movements, the references and all that other stuff that the general public fails to notice anyway. It's for the people who bothered to watch the Animatrix from beginning till end. It's for the people who see the canvas, the people who dreamed a dream when they were kids and the people who wear their geeks on their collar.<br/><br/>And if that makes me an arrogant f***, a pathetic geek, a f***ing fanboy or a sorry looser then so be it.<br/><br/>The Matrix Has Me."

"Two-HeadedBoy","1","1","2","6 November 2003"," The worst film since XXX
","Sorry, folks, but The Matrix Revoloutions is the third worst film I have ever seen (after XXX and Pearl Harbour). There is no continuation whatsoever of the past two (apart from Agent Smith being aboard one of the ships), and aome of the most wooden acting I have ever heard, with the script to match. Packed full of cliches eg. ""You did it"", ""no, WE did it"" and a confusing load of nonsense about 'choices', even the attempts at philosophy are appalling. ""Love is just a word""... ooh, eye-opening. The special effects are extremely OTT, to the point of not knowing what is going on anymore. Wachowski Brothers, it's the wire work that made The Matrix so good, not the computer effects. And what was that they were saying about not making any more after this one? That ending is a blatant suggestion of another sequel in the works. The only part I enjoyed (apart from the credits) was Smith's maniacal laughter. Which he did for no reason. OK, ranting's over now. One out of Ten. So there."
"Morson","1","1","2","6 November 2003"," 75% Great, 25% Crack
","I just got done watching this movie at the IMAX.  I actually liked Reloaded a lot, despite the fact it was loaded with plot holes and improbabilities.. it still managed to show us things we'd not seen before and a creative spark that inspired things like the Ghosts.  The third movie starts out just fine, and introduces some more interesting sequences, and in fact, the real world seagments that were so awful in the original were actually the best parts this time around!<br/><br/>In fact, I was going to say the reviewers were wrong, and my low expectations were seriously raised by the movie.  There's a hovercraft chase that is reminisciant of the Mallinium Falcon chase through the Death Star and tons of great robotic combat.  There's also a pretty interesting,  if mostly pointless, shootout in the Matrix early on.. about the only action scene you'll see inside.<br/><br/>Yep, it's all exceeding my expecations for, while having NONE of the elements that made the original Matrix great, a good action movie.  One with some senseless points that I don't like, such as Neo's real world powers, but I figure ""Hey, I can buy 'mutation' in X-Men, I can buy this if it stays this fun.""<br/><br/>It doesn't.  The last quarter of the movie, I am convinced, is the result of someone bringing the Wiskowskis some complimentary cocaine, and it serves as a giant anti-drug commercial.<br/><br/>Despite the fact there are so many plot holes in the 2nd half to mention in the word limit, it is THE WORST ending to any movie, ever.  It seriously takes all the good work before it and makes you ashamed to even like anything in the movie.  Hell, I can't even watch the earlier matrixes without these 20 minutes wrecking them for me now.  Bad, bad, bad, BAD. If you don't want to hate the Matrix, leave the minute the 'machine city' comes into view.<br/><br/>--- SPOILERS AHEAD ---<br/><br/>In the last five minutes, thinking the ending was too dark, they amp up the crack by trying to back pedal it rapidly.  Dead characters show up, with no explenation.  They act as if they will ""free minds that wish to be freed"" and ""end the war"" - but by my calculations, EVERYONE IN THE MATRIX IS DEAD! Trinity is killed for no good reason, in one of the most pointless, horrible death scenes ever.. and it goes on forever!  If you ever saw National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon, you'll be laughing as you expect her to cough up blood right before the ""Kiss me one last time"" line I knew was coming showed up.. I won't mention the incredibly dumb last fight of Neo vs Smith, the ripped off mummy effects of sentinals forming a face so it can talk to Neo (WTF couldn't it just float over and talk?), the fact that the original Smith did NOT get unplugged, but rather a clone.. the fact that going up kills sentinals attached to a ship hull (why the humans don't just fly in on planes is beyond me..).. it's awful.  Beyond awful.  Mind numbingly awful. Worst ending EVER.<br/><br/>In short, see it at the IMAX, enjoy the first half as a great sci-fi popcorn flick and when the city shows up (it looks like an ACTUAL CITY!  And it's in the real world!) plug your ears, cover your eyes or run from the theatre."
"kpang","1","1","2","6 November 2003"," Not sure what they were thinking
","Spoilers ahead, this is only intended for people who have watched the movie!!!<br/><br/>Revolutions left me incredibly unsatisfied.  Reloaded was decent, but it left a lot of questions up in the air.  I figured that since they already made Revolutions that these questions would be answered.  Boy was I wrong. The movie makes no effort at all to explain events, it just kind of throws them at you.  While I agree that the Matrix has a huge fanbase that derives from the fact that it doesn't go out of its way to explain all the intricacies behind what's going on, you have to feel a little annoyed that absolutely nothing at all was addressed.  There's no explanation on what happened to the Oracle or what her ""decision"" was, there's no explanation of Neo's new found powers in the real world, there's no explanation of how Agent Smith finds a way into the real world, there's no explanation of how Agent Smith loses that battle at the end.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the movie is filled with cheesy dialogue (a couple I recall off the top of my head were along the lines of: ""she'll do it, she's in love"" and ""that's impossible, nobody can pilot mechanical!"") along with some pretty shotty acting (Trinity death scene anyone?  Just die already, or at the very least acknowledge you're in some pain).<br/><br/>I dunno, the Matrix trilogy had a lot of potential to be one of the defining movies of our time.  But I guess it's simply not meant to be.  In my book it'll be another in the long line of movie series that have a great first movie and mediocre sequels mooching off the success of the sequels."

","The backlash to the last two Matrix movies baffles me.  Matrix Reloaded may very well have been the most anticipated movie EVER, and in hindsight, it was impossible to perfect on the first, but is still outstanding once you got over the initial shock of it not being better than part 1.<br/><br/>What I think is that since the first movie was limited in expectations, not to mention the limitations the filmakers had themselves, many people were able to grasp its essentially freshman collage philosophy.  However, once it became a hit, the brothers were able to unload everything they ever knew into Reloaded and Revolutions, and most people weren't able to keep up. Therefore they felt stupid, and they hated the movie for making them feel stupid.<br/><br/>All I have to say is that it's better off that part 2 and 3 weren't what we expected them to be.  If you want a movie to be EXACTLY what you expect and predict it to be in every way, watch LOTR.  The genius of Matrix 2 and 3 is that they were total curve balls - exactly what we WEREN'T expecting, and in the years to come, that will be its legacy.<br/><br/>I'd say that within five years, all those bashing 2 and 3 will eat their words, since they'll have plenty of time to watch and understand them."

","The magic of the first Matrix was found in its silence and austerity regarding its philosophical underpinnings. This allowed the viewers to participate vicariously by grafting their own stories into the gaps. While ""The Matrix"" focused on creating questions, ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" preaches with answers that corral the storyline rather than expand its possibilities.

","What a Showdown!  What a Finale! A Grand Finale! The Whachowski Brothers bring it all together in the final movie of the Matrix Trilogy.  The Oracle, The program Smith, The Machines and real and surreal cyberspace battlefields all come into play in balanced proportions and the solutions of the struggle are convincing and sensible in the end.  A far cry from the not-a-scratch middle piece this last episode takes on a real fight that costs lives and limbs.  The scenery and fighting scenes are awesome.  The movie starts slowly and tension is built up gradually.  The dialog is strange like in the first two movies but it makes more sense now and the the main themes, love, hope, sacrifice, believe and struggle are all appropriate for the drama that this last of the trilogy is.  Some of the dialog with The Oracle could have been made shorter to keep better tempo. The casting was good although this trilogy will not be remembered for its brilliance in acting.  Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity, Mary Alice as The Oracle and Zeke Castelli as Operations Officer Mattis were most impressive.  For me this is the best movie I have seen this year and with this brilliant ending this trilogy is the best I have seen.  A near perfect 10 from me."

","The series stared of with ground-breaking Matrix 1. It had and excellent story and took a direction of a science fiction film. I loved it. Then, The Matrix 2 came out and all you could tell from it is that a story is somehow taking a shift in direction. The Matrix Revolutions proved that the shift was of the worst possible kind.<br/><br/>What was once an innovative, creative, new science fiction now became an `Independence Day.' There is nothing wrong with the Independence Day except from the fact that hundreds of variations on the theme have already been done. (On a side note, I find fighting scenes in Revolutions way too long and quite boring, let alone the dialogue.)<br/><br/>Matrix 1 had a lot of interesting religious references. Second one had them too. The directors tried to force the notion that the serial is a whole by ridiculously stuffing the third part with religious theme. This only `common thread' in the serial falls apart miserably simply because it's not suitable for the subject matter.<br/><br/>The glorious Matrix turned into Matrix Revolutions, a worthless crap.

So what of this final film in the trilogy?  Well, out goes the clever dialogue and the philosophizing (except Agent Smith's nihilistic rant which is answered meaninglessly by Neo).  Out goes any chance of any interesting twists.  And in comes massively overlong sequences with huge guns shooting at swarms of machines (this must have lasted at least a third of the film).

","I cannot imagine the series ending any other way. The resolution,<br/><br/>not only for the plot, but for each individual character, is completely<br/><br/>fitting. As the films repeatedly state, it's all about purpose.<br/><br/>Everyone has a purpose. Morpheus's purpose was to find and<br/><br/>train Neo. Trinity's was to love Neo, and to help him along his path<br/><br/>(though she does, in Reloaded, get in his way; this sets him on yet<br/><br/>another path that she must help him to complete). Neo's purpose<br/><br/>we all know. But even Smith has a purpose. And all complete their<br/><br/>purpose exactly the way they were meant to from the beginning.<br/><br/>Were any of these characters to have found themselves at different<br/><br/>places at the end of the film, it would not have worked.<br/><br/>
I felt that the only solution was peace, not military victory, since I<br/><br/>first saw The Second Renaissance in The Animatrix. It occurred to<br/><br/>me then that there was no way the humans could defeat the<br/><br/>machines. Certainly not in one movie. If the entire human race was<br/><br/>defeated in a true World War that saw the death and/or<br/><br/>subjugation of every living inhabitant, then the possibility of this<br/><br/>small band of freedom fighters triumphing was nil. And then I<br/><br/>recalled the Councillor's dialogue from Reloaded: the machines<br/><br/>need the humans just as the humans need the machines. The<br/><br/>only solution was compromise. The two would have to find a way<br/><br/>to peacefully co-exist. Only then would the war be over. It was what<br/><br/>the humans could not do in The Animatrix. The fear the humans<br/><br/>had for the machines drove them to war against them, and led<br/><br/>ultimately to their own destruction and enslavement. It is only when<br/><br/>Trinity, Neo and Morpheus are able to put aside their fear and face<br/><br/>the machines as equals in Revolutions that peace is possible.<br/><br/>

","May contain SPOILERS! <br/><br/>Make no mistake the Matrix trilogy was ambitious. The first film was as tight and well done as the second film was sloppy. The third film in the series ""Matrix Revolutions"" continues the Wachowski brothers foray into the world of destiny, technology, religion, and spirituality with mixed results.<br/><br/>
There are some great and engrossing scenes in this film and some mind-blowing effects. In fact, the effects are so frequent and so much a part of the narrative (and seemingly every shot) that the viewer's mind quickly dismisses the technical achievement of this film. They shouldn't.<br/><br/>
What should be dismissed is the painfully obvious attempt to include a person of every race, creed, ethnicity etc. The cast of surviving humans is annoyingly predictable. The film is basically ""Tron meets Terminator"". Think about it. Self-aware machines have all but decimated mankind except for in a virtual world of their creation where the battle is fought between programs who have ""users"" in the real world. <br/><br/>Issues like hope, faith, free will, resurrection, predestination, and redemption are brought up often, but the writer-director(s) don't follow through with their thoughts. It's almost as if they were consciously trying to avoid repeating the laughable exposition of the ""architect"" that was widely criticized in the second film. Avoiding that is certainly a good thing. Mixing metaphors and spreading and analogy too thin isn't.<br/><br/>It seems to me that that the strength of Hugo Weaving's performance left the film arguing on behalf of Agent Smith perhaps more persuasively than the Wachowski's would have liked.<br/><br/>However the film was edited well and there were few moments where I cringed at the acting of Reeves. He has a good handle on his character as do the other main cast members. The action and fight scenes were impressive and didn't repeat as much as the second film.

The convoluted story gets even worse than the second movie. There were more holes in the plot than in a colander. Even the one good part of the movie, and so typically it was the battle scene, had so many flaws it was ridiculous. Even movie patrons dressed in Matrix garb looked like they didn't want to be seen after the movie. I have always been respectful of the money people pay to see a movie... always considerate of people who might be enjoying what I think of as garbage.... yet, it was all I could do to not cry out like other people were doing during one particular scene in the movie, ""Dammit, just die already"". (I won't say who, and no, it wasn't Neo.)<br/><br/>Some people probably have speculated that the story ends with Neo (Mr. Anderson) waking up in the real world and realizing that the whole story was all just a dream. Well, I'll tell you right now, that's not how it ends. But believe me, nay, see for yourself, it would have probably been ten times more preferably to the ending it had.<br/><br/>And for everybody who says they don't understand what the characters are talking about in the movie, that the dialogue goes over their heads, listen to me... there is nothing to understand!

Overall, a lot of bad touches but the fight scenes are really good so i guess pros and cons make it about a big 0 :). so 6/10 for me.it was no gigli. p.s. nice touch with killing neo.no way i saw that coming.nice touch also with smith beating the crap outta neo but still outsmarted by the man."

It almost feels like their audience understood better what potential lay in their story than they did themselves. And that can never be a good thing.<br/><br/>An O.K. movie if you just take it for itself and judge it by the usual standards - and if you can still enjoy the awesome visual style and the pitch-perfect action sequences - ""Matrix Revolutions"" is almost a complete failure seen as the closure of the trilogy that has already revolutionized modern cinema.

They can keep the multiple anomalies thing that the Architect explained, as it was logical thing and would be believable that the past anomalies hadn't discovered thier connection to the machines as Neo had done (as this discovery was only brought to light when he walked on the Earths surface to escape the Nebuchadnezzar before it was destroyed.<br/><br/>Having a Matrix within a Matrix would seem to be a logical move by the Architect who said the problem is choice and that he strived for balance.<br/><br/>Then Neo can start to push the boundaries of physics to manipulate this new Matrix and be the first to free people from this Matrix into the world beyond (and if you want another trilogy this too could be another Matrix forming an infinite regression.)"
"ghent1","9","1","3","30 May 2015"," Religious/spiritual/philosophical beauty
","I just love this film. I am not going to try and explain the whole ingenious concept of the trilogy here, others have done this already here and on other sites. Suffice here to say maybe, that for me the first Matrix movie is ontological, the second one is postmodern and the third one religious/spiritual. Maybe that's why many people feel less for Revolutions than for the first two films of the trilogy. <br/><br/>Of course all three of movies have pronounced religious elements but the third part of the trilogy is special. To begin with, as someone else noted here, different characters clearly embody biblical archetypes: Neo = Messiah, Architect = the Father, Oracle = Sophia (= the female wisdom element of the ancients and of early Christianity), Merovingian = Devil (see what's written on the button when they take the elevator to his club at the onset of Revolutions) etc. Not only is Neo transformed into a pure and simple Messiah and depicted as such towards the end of the film. But if you look carefully, it seems that Neo isn't only a Saviour for the people, but also for the machines. Just look at how the machines respectfully put him back onto the floor after he delivered the matrix from the Smith virus, how they pull him carefully onto some special ceremonial carriage to then take him away in a manner which makes one think they will construct him a temple and an inner sanctuary somewhere inside of machine city. Instead of Christ solemnly pronouncing 'It's done' just before dying on the cross, it's the machine Father which does it. <br/><br/>In my view, Neo is thus some kind of Christ who sacrifices his life and his heart as salvation to both humans and machines. Not only does Neo set the matrix free by no longer fighting Smith to keep evil out. As Neo was the first one of his kind to plug into the machine like he did, by sacrificing himself to Smith so that the machines can heal the matrix, I feel he taught the cold, heartless machines what it means to respect humanity and feel for them. Or maybe he evoked feelings in them for the first time as such. Surely, Neo is the very first being of flesh and blood to be resurrected into pure light (see end of the movie) before being carried off as a holy chalice inside of machine city. I'm just speculating here, but it seemed to me that as a result of Neo's crucifixion upon the cross of the matrix, the Architect -originally pure and cold analysis- was a bit more warm hearted at the very end of the film, when addressing the Oracle, telling her that humans will be free to leave. In my interpretation that's the result of what Neo gave to the machines when he sacrificed his life. In doing all that, maybe Neo even brought the two opposite poles of Oracle/intuition/feminine and Architect/ratio/masculine a bit closer together, a split which is, incidentally, a classic in Western philosophy. <br/><br/>Some words about the overly long battle between Neo and Smith towards the end. Many people think this is all too long and tedious, but for me it makes total sense. The long battle is meant to emphasize to Neo that the path to truly become humanity's and the machine's Messiah, and maybe to bring a beginning of understanding between them, is not by trying to destroy Smith/evil/sin. By endlessly fighting him in vain, he is shown that he will never succeed that way. Neo had to fight until he almost perished from fatigue before the Oracle shows him the true path to his function as the world's Messiah: not by fighting sin can he save the world, but by taking it upon him (cfr Christ on the cross). Only then does Neo sacrifice himself by becoming Smith, his antithesis realizing that, despite all his superpowers, this is not the right path. Behind this is both a very Buddhist and a very Christian philosophy of life.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's clear that if you are the kind of person with no feeling for such kinds of things, as it seems there are many, you will probably find Revolutions a tedious film. <br/><br/>A final word on the death scene of Trinity. I for one truly felt the moment of Neo's and Trinity's love only, but intensely, upon her death. I was quite touched by this moment of tender honesty in the middle of the cold machine city. The Wachowski brothers managed to make this moment in the movie shine. In addition, it's only after Neo had to let go of Trinity that he's truly ready to sacrifice himself as the Messiah to save the world. Remember that in Matrix Reloaded Neo was not ready for that yet, as at that time Trinity could still be saved.<br/><br/>Brilliant film and the crowning achievement of a magnificent trilogy."

","In most film trilogies, the third film is the grand finale, and the ""Matrix"" saga ends with a hell of a bang. After some brief pursuits and fights that wrap up a few loose ends from the last film, this movie goes all-out with a massive battle between men and machines; the Battle of Zion is easily one of my favorite battle scenes among sci-fi films. And then it goes on to show off the final duel between Neo and Agent Smith; this lengthy fight goes literally all over the place, with style and power that elevates it to being one of the best fights of all time.<br/><br/>This movie does get a bad rap for its story; the first half-hour is a bit of a frivolous subplot, and the film's conclusion is quite anticlimactic. Even more frustrating for some is that there's not as much philosophical depth as the last two films. But I've always been pleased with this story; it's linear and easy to follow, it still has quality characterization, and even though the philosophy may be gone, I believe there's a strong theological theme that emerges, thanks to the nature of the main character and his final solution. It may not make good enough sense for some, but for me, it's a sublime ending.<br/><br/>Like its predecessors, this movie has quality photography and editing. Acting is good all around, with the same cast as the last film. Writing is still quite good. Production value is high, with plenty of good sets, props, costumes, and excellent special effects.

","This week, I have watched two of the worst films I have seen for a long time. The first was The Matrix - Revolutions, the third and final part of the trilogy. I don't know if you have seen it, but the plot is based around the story of Jesus. There is even a part when Neo goes to fight his arch rival and there is a light around him, which signifies a cross. Needless to say, he sacrifices himself to save his fellow man. The religious iconography in this film has destroyed the entire concept of the film. The first in the series is very dark and tells a tale of looking for the hidden truth. The idea stands very well between all the fight scenes and action shots. The second film is pure and utter existential philosophy, but with a bit more fighting and the for mentioned action scenes. The third film is absolute drivel. The idea actually does come to a head, but the whole mood of the Matrix idea is spoilt with metaphorical references to Christ, to such an extent that Neo actually becomes the Saviour of the human race."

","I might get a lot of flak for comparing 'The Matrix Revolutions' with 'Lord of the Rings 3,' however each had the same concept: 1st half was basically nothing followed by the enviable second act ""final battle."" Sure when the big bang sets off, it's non-stop CGI. Is it exciting? No. It's just ""look at what we can do with a budget"" technology. Zero characters we cared about, so if they lived, died, sliced, diced, we could care less. In fact, I might have secretly hoped the humans perished; at least the computer & its renegade programs had heart. And enough with the ""why, why, why"" whining Neo. He's playing dumb, and though that's his forte, by this third installment, it's just plain annoying. As parts two and three were filmed simultaneously, I felt more and more sorry for wonderful actors Moss and Fishburne who, by this point, are just jumping through hoops held by the Wachowskis, much as Jackson and McGregor did for Lucas in the 'Star Wars' mediocre prequels. I've already given the summary, but here's even more depth: Neo, Trinity and gang must stop Agent Smith, aid and be aided by the (new) Oracle, and ward off a 10,000,000 to 1 fight against the machines. While the movie's a waste, three things irked me beyond recovery. #1 Yes, unfortunately, Gloria Foster, who played the Oracle in Parts 1-2, died in real life, they made such a stink about a new ""form"" (or actress) Oracle – seriously. Just say 1 line that she decided a new shell and move on. #2 A main character dies in the end – for like seven minutes. #3 You ever wait for a train for too long? You will in this film as well. Only two scenes fared well: Neo's finale with Smith and the Oracle/Architect's conversation. Sadly, those added up to the only 15 decent minutes out of 129."
"tburke85","4","1","3","5 June 2009"," The Matrix Revolutions A Big Disappointment
","The Matrix Revolutions at least to me was the worst of the trilogy. The first one was great and the best of the three films. The second one was okay but could've been better. Revolutions isn't that bad action wise but the movie leaves many questions unanswered and the ending isn't the greatest either. The Wachowski brothers have done an admirable job of bringing the Matrix movies to the big screen but the last two films aren't as nearly as good or exciting as the first film was at least in my opinion. It was a big disappointment like Spider-man 3 or Pirates 2 to name a few. For those of you who haven't seen it yet I won't give way any big spoilers but I will say that it's worth seeing once only for the action but after a while even that becomes a bit of a let down. Don't get me wrong the movie isn't that bad it just could have been so much better. Keanu Reeves turns in a good performance as Neo the so called One who must find a way find a way to end the war between the machines and save his people from annihilation. Laurence Fishburne continues to be the best Morpheus who finds himself with Niobe in a race to Zion in order to help their people wage off the attack by the machines. Carrie Anne Moss is effective as Trinity making her a tough and skilled freedom fighter willing to sacrifice herself for the greater good. Hugo Weaving is excellent as the rogue Agent Smith who can make copies of himself and is beginning to take over the Matrix. Jada Pinkett Smith is equally impressive as Niobe another tough freedom fighter who journeys with Morphues to Zion. But unfortunately all their characters get even less screen time than they did in the previous one because Revolutions seemed to focus more on on the battle at Zion between the rest of the human survivors and the machines that are bent on annihilating them . The battle at Zion is amazing and it does last for a while but the movies loses focus on the main characters who made these films entertaining by the actors playing them. The other action/fight sequences are also well choreographed but most of them including the final showdown between Smith and Neo can't help but feel like a letdown compared to ones in the first Matrix film. The lack of screen time not only given to Reeves, Fisburne, and Moss but mainly to Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith is what really hurt the movie for me. Reeves, Fishburne, and Moss aren't given much to do except for some action/fight sequences their characters unfortunately take a back seat in this one allowing state of the art special effects to take over. Weaving makes for an imposing villain and does a good job with the small role he does have in Revolutions. After watching all three films it seems like the most screen time he got as Agent Smith was in the first one. His role got smaller in Reloaded only showing up for some scenes here and there as the movies went on his longest one being his first fight with Neo. In Revolutions his role is even smaller since his character disappears for larger parts of the movie than he did in Reloaded which is unfortunate because Weaving is great in the role. Mary Alice who takes over for Gloria Foster as The Oracle does a good job with the all too brief role and the rest of the cast are for the most part okay but none of them stand out. Another problem with the movie was the final showdown between Smith and Neo which kind of felt anti-climatic and rushed because their fight doesn't last very long at all. It's not nearly as impressive as their confrontations were in the first film or Reloaded. The special effects to create the machines and the brief scene in which their city is shown are an amazing sight to see on screen but spectacle alone doesn't make a good movie. Overall The Matrix Revolutions is another third movie in a trilogy (like Spider-man 3, Pirates 3, or X-Men 3 to name a few) that start off okay but end up being a major letdown compared to the previous films. Despite the cool action/fight sequences and special effects I really wanted to enjoy the rest of The Matrix Revolutions but instead it left me feeling very disappointed."

","The Matrix Revolutions (2003), third and final installation of the Matrix series is considered the worst of the three by many viewers. Now after second viewing I can relate to both negative and positive reviews. It isn't very good movie, but it surely isn't as bad as it's told either.<br/><br/>The Matrix (1999) was and is a masterpiece. Not only as a technical achievement for revolutionary special effects but having one of the most original stories Wachowskis brothers created one of the seminal movies ever made. It was a really jaw dropping experience back in 99 and it's nearly that still today.<br/><br/>Matrix Reloaded (2003) included some fancy scenes but as a whole it was quite incoherent mess. The Zion scenes weren't nearly as interesting as scenes inside matrix. Story was very confusing and many things left unexplained. Still I was ready to forgive these things if Revolutions would turn out to be as good (or even nearly as good) as original Matrix. I had very high hopes for the last installation to sum up everything that was brought up in Reloaded.<br/><br/>After seeing Revolutions in premiere 2003 it felt huge disaster. If I had reviewed it back then, I would give it something more like 3/10. Nothing was explained nor nothing new brought up. Just the same old ""machines are getting closer oh no"", ""we gotta protect Zion"", ""you know Neo what brought you here?"" yadda yadda yadda. What was the purpose of that Merovingian guy? What is it with Agent Smith? Why is he doing what he is doing? What was all that Architects waffle about in Reloaded? And not only that but the rate of the dialog was lowered nearly at the bottom (""I don't have time for this s*it""), and the script was bloated with just completely pointless raffle, just look at this:<br/><br/>"" Agent Smith: Why, Mr. Anderson? Why do you do it? Why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you're fighting for something? For more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know? Is it freedom? Or truth? Perhaps peace? Yes? No? Could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson. Vagaries of perception. The temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose. And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself, although only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson. You must know it by now. You can't win. It's pointless to keep fighting. Why, Mr. Anderson? Why? Why do you persist?<br/><br/>Neo: Because I choose to. ""<br/><br/>AAAAARRRRGGHHH!!!!!!<br/><br/>Way too much time was spent in Zion, way too much talking and the ending was horrible. I could really come with a lot of stuff that was bad or lacked in Reloaded and Revolutions if I wanted, the cgi-fight between men and machines was really tensionless, character names were uninventive (the man who makes keys.. he's the Key Maker! The man with the train.. The Train Man!), Monica Bellucci was only for showing tits in Revolutions, and so on but lets leave it here..<br/><br/>I viewed it second time last night, and it felt somewhat improved. If one could view it as an indepent film, it isn't so bad. Just try to forget you ever saw The Matrix (1999) and this one will be a bit better. Action scenes are cool as ever, kind of apocalyptic feeling is present in most of the movie, and some individual scenes were in the league of the best scenes in a whole trilogy, like Neos confrontation with the Deus ex machina, highly classy scene, and the final fight with Agent Smith was closest thing anime has came to live action movie.<br/><br/>Still, it had awful and redundant dialog at times, it included one of the corniest dying scene ever filmed, and I still can't stand the ending tough.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: Main problem with Reloaded and Revolutions is that they spend too much time in ""the real world"". In Matrix (1999) time spent in matrix is somewhere 90% of the whole movie. It's the core and soul of the whole movie. In Reloaded matrixtime was maybe 40-50% and Revolutions below 30%. I don't care about the Zion, Niobe, Link, that boy who idolizes Neo and saves the day in Revolutions (already forgot his name), or anyone/anything that goes on outside the matrix.<br/><br/>Matrix Revolutions as indepent film 6/10 <br/><br/>Matrix Revolutions as a Matrix film 3/10"
"raypdaley182","4","1","3","22 February 2008"," Worst of the trilogy
","Picking up where the last movie left off (meaning this film is of no use to viewers as a stand-alone movie by expecting you to see its predecessor) we pick up with Trinity watching over the injured Neo and our recently discovered survivor who we know from the previous movie is inhabited by Agent Smith.<br/><br/>Of the 3 films this 1 is unique because it doesn't start with a Trinity action sequence like the other 2 did.<br/><br/>1 of the themes explored in this movie is the idea of artificial intelligence, computers or programs able to comprehend human emotions and concepts much like the family of Programs that Neo meets in the station that exists as a transit point between The Matrix & the machine world.<br/><br/>The 1st hugely bad idea in the film is the coat check scene. This has really already been fully explored in the original movie when Neo & Trinity rescued Morpheus so this wasn't something we hadn't already seen. It also very closely mirrors going to find The Keymaker from the 2nd film so it's not like it hadn't been seen just once.<br/><br/>Once the film hits the 30 to 40 minute mark it really starts to drag its feet with the preparations for the war on Zion. It seems like at this point in the film they just ran out of ideas and decided to just drag scenes out for as long as possible whether they contributed to the plot or not regardless of how it effected the pacing of the movie in general.<br/><br/>Neo is incredibly stupid as are all the freed Zionites who have ever seen or spoken to Agent Smith. None of them recognise Smith's voice from the guy he took over inside The Matrix.<br/><br/>The Mech's defending Zion aren't anything new (Almost certainly stolen from Quake 2 or RobotJox, depending on your frame of reference). Their defence strategy is laughably American, shoot as many bullets as you possibly can in the hope of hitting something. (Clearly not a good idea when Zion obviously has limited resources?). I also didn't understand why they weren't using EMP weapons which would have been the quickest and best defence against electronic creatures like the squids. Zion had already shown they HAD EMP technology in film 1 (destroying the squid that boarded the Neb).<br/><br/>Now clearly they DO have EMP weapons as their using them to defend Gate 3 and the guys reloading the Mech's so why the hell weren't the Mech's fitted with them? It is obvious Trinity will die, really she has to for Neo to be able to truly destroy The Matrix and save Zion. Without the pain of her death he would never have enough power.<br/><br/>I did wonder exactly how he was going to get back into The Matrix without anyone to jack him in but they solved that quite nice with the machine intelligence doing it for him, leading of course to the final battle with all the Smith Clones.<br/><br/>Yes, it's ridiculously over the top and far too over done and goes on for too long. I assume by allowing Smith to infect him Neo then has the ability to control all the Smith clones and destroy them which in turns destroys the entire Matrix as Smith has become so many people in The Matrix.<br/><br/>In actuality by destroying all the Smiths Neo has simply reset The Matrix into its 7th incarnation. This is an incredibly weak and poorly explained ending which could have been done much better. as the ending of a trilogy this is not a good movie. It is not a good movie in its own right either.<br/><br/>The best of the trilogy as in most cases was the original. The 2nd and 3rd films really aren't worth bothering with."
"eldergod-1","4","1","3","15 February 2005"," Quite chaotic.
","The last movie in the popular ""Matrix"" trilogy concludes the series with a lot of action and battles, which, sadly, does not make a good plot. As in the second volume, there are many annoying kung-fu battles and people, who try to look cool just for the sake of being cool - goggles, long coats, you know. The two main characters are as distasteful as in the previous two movies and the bad guy is even more laughable. That said, the battle for Zyon was very entertaining, even if unrealistic and the last combat between Neo and Smith is the best moment in the whole story - not because of the fight itself, but because of the creepy atmosphere in the Matrix. The finish also is not candylike, which was a pleasant surprise. But after three not-that-great movies, I was too tired to enjoy it."

","Horrible ending to the highly-popular, but very suspect series has Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and a faceless crowd of others trying to save the remainder of the human race at Zion from an army of heartless and ruthless machines. ""The Matrix Revolutions"" continues the seemingly endless journey by picking up right where ""Reloaded"" finished and confusion runs amok as Armageddon is the premise. Again Hugo Weaving is the primary bad guy as the leader of a race of controllers who want nothing more than to destroy Reeves for good. Characters appear and disappear and most are never developed or used the way they should have been (Jada Pinkett Smith and Monica Bellucci are prime examples). The undertones of the series keep on slapping us in the face and in the end we are left with a long and pointless special-effects heavy mess that has little coherency and even less intelligence. ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is so full of chaos that every performer gets left behind in the dizzying maze that is the film. Not even Reeves gets as much screen-time as he deserved and the others just seem to be caught in a revolving door of crazed camera-shots. I never have been a huge fan of this series, but after the second installment I thought I might change my tune when I viewed this chapter. However I honestly came out feeling very cheated and highly disappointed. I saw no point in ""The Matrix"" , I saw a glimmer of hope with ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and I felt like I crashed into a cinematic wall of stale, loud and uncreative ideas with ""The Matrix Revolutions"". By the finale of this I felt like I was watching whacked 1980s-styled cartoons where ""The Transformers"" were trying to save the Earth from evil robots bent on destruction. Completely empty, incredibly disjointed and very worthless, let's hope that we won't have to sit through ""The Matrix Reborn"". 2 stars out of 5."
"santa_vaca","3","1","3","7 November 2003"," Revulsions (spoilers)
","I saw the movie the night before last. I enjoyed watching it, partly because I was surrounded by a bunch of friends. As I left the theatre, I was pretty pumped. But the more I think about it, the dumber it seems. I've put off posting a review because this movie has made it uniquely difficult for me to articulate my opinion. But I'm going to put in a few thoughts that have solidified themselves, and maybe I'll add more later:<br/><br/>Some things that didn't make sense:<br/><br/>-If the people of Zion had enough time and resources to build their robot-exoskeleton army and elaborate holographic security system to fight the sentinels, why didn't they use the time to saturate the perimiter of Zion with EMPs?<br/><br/>-Why was the commander from Reloaded so freaked out about letting a couple ships go find the Oracle, when the remaining ships didn't have any part in the final battle?<br/><br/>-Why did the machines bother sending a quarter million sentinels to Zion, when a couple nukes strapped to the digging machines would have done the same job far more efficiently?<br/><br/>-Why did the Merovingian release Neo, when it would have been far easier to say he would until Trinity put her gun away and then have his people shoot them, or, even better, tell the train man to drop their asses off in limbo and leave them there with Neo, since they all went there to pick him up anyway?<br/><br/>-Why couldn't Neo beat the train man? If the Merovingian knew enough to be able to design a world and agents that are Neo-proof, why was it so hard for the Architect to do the same thing with the Matrix? If the train man could be programmed to be that much stronger than Neo, why wasn't he the one that the machines hired to defeat Smith?<br/><br/>-Once Neo defeated Smith and died, what stopped the sentinels from finishing off Zion? And how was a truce that was far less stable than anything ever signed by Israel and Palestine supposed to be a happy ending?<br/><br/>Other parts I didn't like:<br/><br/>I didn't like how they tried to cram as many movie cliches into the film as possible, with none of the development to pull them off. There was the plucky little soldier with the gruff commanding officer, who met in one scene and the next time they saw each other was the touching death scene. ""I never completed the training"" ""Neither did I"" Boo hoo hoo. There was the little girl who got assimilated by Smith, and we were supposed to feel bad because she's a cute little girl, even though we barely knew who she was. There was the wife that we saw once coming back to fire a crucial and contrived shot to save her husband. There was Trinity's schmaltzy death scene. Trinity's lines for that scene were straight from Chow Yun Fat in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but it had absolutely no emotional resonance. All that sex in the second movie, and I still wasn't involved in the relationship enough to care.<br/><br/>I also didn't like the fighting. It's gone steadily downhill since the first movie. In that film, the characters were able to bend reality, but it was still based in real life. In this film, the only fighting that was at all interesting was in the parking lot outside the club, and that was over in 10 seconds. After that, there was the bullet-spewing fight in the hat check room that was so concerned with showing off the villains' pointless skill of standing on the ceiling that it forgot to be exciting. And the final scene with Neo vs. Smith was one of the dullest fights I've ever seen. When two characters spend an entire fight flying at each other like Superman and showing that they won't ever really get hurt, no matter how hard they're hit, it loses some of its urgency.<br/><br/>I won't go over how cartoonish, emotionless, uninteresting and overly-digitally-produced the Zion battle was, compared with the action centerpieces of either of the other movies (rescuing Morpheus or the freeway chase), other than to say that it would have been more at home in one of the Star Wars prequels than a Matrix movie. All I can say is that it held my attention in the theatre.<br/><br/>I just watched the original Matrix. I had forgotten how much I liked it. And it's not because it had any fewer plot holes or pretentiously silly techno-babble than the newer one. It's because of the emotion. Neo spent much of the movie confused, excited, scared, happy, angry or tired, and the audience felt what he felt. He was confused at the beginning, and so were we. He was frightened when he woke up, and so was the audience. He was excited to learn kung fu, and the idea excited us as well. He was scared to fight Smith in the subway, and we felt his fear, which added a layer of depth to the fact that he did it anyway. By the end of the film, when he finally found his power and threw off his timidity and confusion, I was more excited that I'd been in a long time. It was a payoff that made the journey worthwhile.<br/><br/>The folly of the sequels is that the filmmakers tried to give the payoffs without the cost. They knew how much we loved to see these characters finally find the power to go after the antagonists without fear, so they gave that to us through the entire movie. They were perpetually calm and composed in the face of whatever danger they were in. Their clothes never wrinkled, and their sunglasses stayed on. There was no emotion to latch on to, no suspense, and the journeys of the characters seemed completely pointless. It made the plot exposition feel contrived, and the action scenes feel like tedious filler between scenes of plot exposition.<br/><br/>But I think the biggest folly of the final two movies is that they were made at all. The conclusion of The Matrix was completely satisfying. They accomplished the rare feat of taking an interesting (though not flawless) idea, exploring it completely, and finishing with neither loose ends nor excess. If they had let it stand, it would have been remembered as an anomoly. An incredibly fascinating, well-made and original movie that came out of nowhere, influenced film and culture in a way that few pieces of art can aspire to, and stood as an icon in film history. As it is, the studio and the filmmakers got greedy. And now The Matrix will never be seen as anything but a good beginning to a mediocre and somewhat disappointing trilogy."

"Delciovieira","10","1","4","27 November 2017"," Hollywood blockbuster makes pubic thinking for the third time.
","It is an inglorious destiny for a film that closes with academic competence the saga of Neo, Trinity and Morpheus. Note that the competence cited here has two meanings. The first is good, as the adventure ties loose ends, guarantees two hours of entertainment and still leaves ample room for discussion (there is a new character that should make fans crazy want to understand it better, the little girl Sati). The other, bad, is the lack of innovation, as in a hasty work of beginners in which any kind of experimentation is left aside to favor conventional solutions already seen and reviewed in the cinema.<br/><br/>However, if the conclusion is based on the truism, it is in isolated scenes that Revolutions sustains itself and imbalances the balance. The final fight between Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Smith (Hugo Weaving, perfect) - a street fight between Supermen - is great, the machines attack on Zion is exciting and the visit to the city of 01, the capital of machines , quite satisfactory for who conferred ""The second reborn"", episode of the series Animatrix. Also noteworthy is the treatment given by writers to women in the film. Trinity has never been so determined and tough, Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) even eclipses Morpheus and even Zee (Nona Gaye) appears to save the day. The Matrix women do not drive home and never lose their femininity.<br/><br/>The story of Revolutions begins exactly from the point where they stopped Reloaded and Enter the Matrix, the video game of the saga. Neo is in a coma after destroying sentinels in the real world with his mind. Zion's defenses are preparing to face the biggest battle of its history, while hundreds of thousands of robots advance towards the city. Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) decide to enter the Matrix for the last time to find the Oracle (Mary Alice) and try to save the predestined. Helped by Seraph, they discover that the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) may be behind the Neo state. The battle is imminent on both fronts, the real world and simulated reality, and even the winner can lose everything, as the Smith virus has reached alarming proportions and has only one wish in mind: the end of all forms of existence.<br/><br/>Coming to expectations or not, one can not help but admire the fact that a hugely successful Hollywood blockbuster for the third time will make fans think and discuss the story for years, seeking philosophical, theological, and literary references. The debate is positive and the result is overwhelming. And that, no one pulls the Matrix. Be it the original, Reloaded or Revolutions."

The acting is as bad as watching Talledaga Nights and the direction is of The Wachoski's worst efforts. They add stupid sub characters that are irrelevant to the story that are just added there to annoy the living hell out of everyone. The sub plots are too cramped with dialogue that its hard not to go to sleep. OK the sub plots in Reloaded were fine, balanced with intriguing acting and powerful action but Revolutios take the sub plots and inter-wines them with baffled dialogue.<br/><br/>So all in all the Wachoski's have practically ruined the Matrix Trilogy.

","OK, so the matrix was great - there's no doubt about it. The look of the whole film was cutting edge, it presented action scenes the like of which had never been seen before, and the plot - if not as ""deep"" as some might suggest, was at least coherent, and held the attention for the whole film.<br/><br/>The Matrix reloaded ranks as one of the biggest disappointments in my movie-going life. Not only was it completely unnecessary, it was boring beyond belief and even the (admittedly spectacular) freeway scene couldn't relieve the embarrassment of the ""rave"" scene and superfluous religious imagery.<br/><br/>The Matrix revolutions may or may not be worse than ""reloaded"" - it's hard to tell since my expectations were so much lower. What is for certain though, is that it is a bad film. It still takes itself way too seriously, still alternates incongruously between tedious pseudo-philosophising and implausible action sequences that go on so long they themselves become tedious.<br/><br/>And it's so stoopid! - OK so here's the possible spoiler - at the end when Neo makes a deal with the machines, WHY would the machines keep their part of the bargain? They're machines! If they were programmed in the first place with some sense of honour, why weren't they programmed not to want to take over the world?<br/><br/>If you've seen the matrix but not it's sequels - don't! If you have seen the sequels, just try not to associate them with the original - no point in tainting the memory of an outstanding film.."

","As I look back on the Matrix Trilogy, and particularly this third one, I think of them more in the genre of comic books brought to the big screen. Except these never were comic books. This third installment, right at 2 hours running time, continues with the concept of 'NEO' as the savior of the real world. The movie begins in the real world, in one of the ships, the now familiar green computer code traveling down in columns on a black background, with some discussion of ""the machines"" heading towards Zion, due to reach it in just under 20 hours. If the machines are successful, perhaps mankind in the real world will be destroyed. Meanwhile, NEO is somehow trapped between the Matrix and the real world, at a train station, and only the ""train man"" can get him back home. The Oracle again plays a key role.<br/><br/>While at the train station NEO meets a man, his wife, and their young daughter, who are really computer programs in the Matrix, but speak of ""family love."" This represents a conceptual evolution within the three Matrix movies, the idea of computer programs attaining emotions.<br/><br/>The movie continues and fierce battles between the men and the machines are shown. It appears as though Zion will be destroyed. But NEO begs the mysterious powers to hook into the Matrix, to go back and fight the program. He is asked, ""What if you fail?"" He answers simply, ""I won't."" He encounters multiple Agent Smiths, the visuals are fantastic, with even some Superman like flying scenes high above the city. In the end, after 12 minutes of fight on film, the will of NEO overcomes the computer programs, all the Agent Smiths are destroyed, and at that moment the machines retreat from Zion, ""The War Is Over."" <br/><br/>I prefer not to try to analyze the film's message too much. One is obvious, the triumph of good over evil. However, to me this last chapter, and in fact all three Matrix movies, are to be enjoyed mostly for the superb visuals that the Wachowski brothers have created. I find it most enjoyable to just sit back, watch and listed, as the stories are told in classic comic book style."

","This movie has an extremely misleading title: the word ""revolution,"" suggests that there would be some sort of change. However, this film features absolutely nothing we have not seen in the previous two installments. Many people would say that at least the action in this film was awesome. Wrong. It was awesome in the first movie. Now, while watching it, you are left, not in amazement, but rather, thinking, ""Oh, this tired old sh*t again.""<br/><br/>The plot is a predictable, overlong mess that results in something that may qualify as a film. Every single event in that film took much longer than it needed to. Trust me, I like long movies. But, this just failed completely. It managed to evoke no emotion from me but anger and frustration. The action was incredibly boring, and lasted way too long. Why is it that I am commenting more on the action than the plot? Well, that, good master or madame, would be because the film seems to feature no plot to comment on. While watching this, you are incredibly aware that you are watching a movie--there is absolutely no way to connect with those soulless, monotonous drones they pass of as characters, not to mention the acting is terrible.<br/><br/>Now, this movie puts a bunch of special effects on the screen to try and win over the viewer with all the nice-looking robots and the creative designs of areas. The result is an impossible to follow sh*t-fest with tons of annoying sound effects, and seizure-inducing lights. Even with the action and special effects that the Watchowski brothers thought me may consider a movie, this was not, in the slightest bit entertaining. As a matter of fact, the most interesting part of the film was when the DVD began to skip a bit, and I was desperately hoping it would end up skipping straight to the credits.

"tomdrazen","1","1","5","20 March 2005"," Atrocity
","If the system would allow me to give this movie a zero I would without thinking twice. The reason is because this movie shouldn't have been made to begin with. As far as I'm concerned by making the first movie (The Matrix) The Wachowski brothers were in fact battling the Matrix of Hollywood by creating a cutting edge film based on an amazingly original and refreshing idea against all odds. it was the type of film that could excite almost any human being, leaving everyone with a lot of food for thought. Rather than to let this movie remain a cult film, which will be respected on the highest of levels for years to come, the makers decided to belittle their original achievement by making the two sequels. Since the main motivation for this was the enormous amount of money that they were given by the studio I would say that the Wachowski brothers are now officially a part of the Hollywood matrix. (actually I think they should now be referred to as the Smith brothers.) Never have I seen a bigger cinematic sell out. This movie is the biggest piece of crap ever. cgi and special effects are interesting but only minor compared to a good plot. The first movie had a brilliant plot. This one had no plot. I literally fell asleep the first time I watched it. I then watched it a second time (please do not attempt this at home) and was furious throughout it's entirety. How could the Smithowsky brothers commit this atrocity? Do not watch this movie, do not rent it, do not purchase it, do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars - Just Stay Away - if you are a real matrix fan."
"apereztenessa-1","10","1","6","10 August 2007"," Deeply misunderstood movie (and trilogy)
","Okay, so let me tell you the truth. You may not like it, but it's like that red pill, you know you have to take it... Ready? The first Matrix sucked, the following two movies are brilliant, each in a different way.<br/><br/>The first Matrix is one of the most unoriginal movies ever released. The idea that the world we live in is an unreal one is as old as the world, really. It has also been seen on film before, several times, in different versions. For example, Total Recall (late 80's) relied on a very similar idea. The much-praised philosophical references behind The Matrix are a joke. It's philosophy 101, the kind of philosophy that your Mom's neighbor probably knows about. The way action was depicted in the movie was not very original either. It was an import from the Hong Kong action movies of the 80's. In addition, The Matrix positioned itself as the ""ultimate action film"". But most action scenes in the Matrix are completely unexciting (in part because of the story itself - when everything is virtual, it is hard to worry for your character's life). The dialog is a total disaster (that remains true in the entire trilogy). What saves the movie, somewhat, is its depiction of the computer world. Not that, as a concept, that was original either (see Tron), but it was definitely updated. How do you take the world of computers that surrounds us and represent it in a cinematic way? Programs, hackers, etc. The most interesting concept in the entire movie is that a group of people are ""hacking reality"". What a beautiful idea! Unfortunately, it is hidden in the dialog behind pretentious, stereotyped lines about Alice in Wonderland, Plato, Buddha and what not.<br/><br/>In the end, the best thing about The Matrix is that it opened up the way for its two sequels. Each of them reinvents the saga in a different way.<br/><br/>The Matrix Reloaded is a personal and risky movie, very much in line with the best of independent film-making. The Wachovskys take the chance of making a movie about stuff that actually means something to them. Out Plato, Buddha and others they didn't really understand anyway; In Star Wars, Tron, Anime. The movie focuses fully on the subject of computer world representation, going into representing firewalls, viruses, anti-viruses, spy-ware, password decoders, operating systems (think Mr Smith, the Keymaker, the Architect). What an abundance of interesting images! In an unprecedented move for a blockbuster, the Wachovskys complicate the story to the greatest degree, making it almost impossible to understand, to make the audience focus on the representation of this world, on the ""feel"" and on the cinematic experience. They take the style from the first film and give it a whole new meaning. The lack of excitement in this film is total (in part because Neo is made invincible, killing all notion of risk and excitement) but sought-after this time. The action scenes become pure choreography, almost ballet. Matrix Reloaded never positions itself as an ""ultimate super-exciting action movie"", but rather as a contemplative film experience. The story surprisingly gains depth too: the ""real world"" is not a group of ""happy free friends"" anymore, but a political/ military group, with a strange sectarian feel. Is that ""real world"" any better than the Matrix?. The final sequence, where Neo brings Trinity back to life, almost digitally, by literally ""holding her heart in his hand"" is one of the most beautiful images seen on screen in several years.<br/><br/>After such radical success, where do you take the saga from there? Matrix Revolutions takes it in a totally different direction. No wonder they called it ""revolutions""! Because in every movie, the concept is completely turned around, yet around the same core. So, ""revolutions"" as in creative destruction, but also as in continuous turn, because it seems that the same concept could be re-conducted in completely new ways forever.<br/><br/>Matrix Revolutions is often interpreted as a ""matrix within the matrix"" story. To that ""Russian dolls"" view, I prefer a radical change interpretation. I think Matrix Revolutions gets away from the computer representation scheme of Matrix Reloaded, to deliver a very unexpected type of ""the One"", an almost religious one! Neo becomes an actual Messiah (the relationship with the figure of Christ is striking: sacrificing his life for humanity, he leaves in a ""crucified"" position). We even get to see how he sees the real world in ""God's code"" (a code made of light, voluntarily very far from anything that would resemble a computer code). Think about it: we get to see the world the way God sees it!! From a film style perspective, the movie is a revolution too. Out goes the clean world of ""the Matrix"" with its slow-motion movements; In comes the light- speed ""real world"", with its dirt, its blood and its real death. Revolutions also takes an ""aquatic"" approach to action. The enemies look unequivocally like squids, and they move like squids. It's taking the pace and style of the Ocean and introducing it into action scenes in an industrial setting. Impressive! That aquatic feel is reinforced by the last fight scene between Neo and Mr Smith, which really feels like shot under water. I have read some people complaining about the end of the movie not explaining enough elements. My criticism to Revolutions goes the other way. I wish the final scenes had been deleted. I didn't need those sunsets in the end. Imagine it had stopped right when Neo is carried away ""crucified"" and all you ever saw in the movie was rain. What a perfect, open-ended ending that would have been! I believe the Matrix saga will be recovered from its poor understanding as time goes by, probably by real cinephiles rather than the large audiences that made the first Matrix a success, and it will influence generations of filmmakers to come by the boldness and creativity of its two sequels."

3. Morpheus - type of John the Baptist (prepared the way for Neo)
4. Mr. Smith - type of The Devil

","When the credits for the movie came up and yet another great song by Rage Against The Machine blaring in my ears, I just thought to myself, what a great piece of entertainment this movie was. I was a big fan of the first one (like other millions were) and was eagerly awaiting the sequel. Although it might not be as good as the first one in terms of it shocking us the way it did in 99 when it brought to us such a new flavour in cinema in terms of development in action, special effects and its terrific story. All and all it still held up very well considering the pressure this movie had on its shoulders to live up to the great expectation. I think that's why a lot of people weren't real keen on this one, because it had such huge pressure, and whatever the Wachowski's produced, it wasn't going to be good enough, or people would say it could or should of been better. I believe the Wachowski brothers made it more epic and like most sequels, you can tell that it had a s*** load more money to work with. Apart from the Zion scene and the Twins not getting enough screen time, this movie was right up there, and for a movie just to sit back in awe and watch all these fighting sequences, car chases and special effects in action, it's a special movie."
"Leofwine_draca","7","0","2","26 August 2016"," Invigorating conclusion to a fine comic book-style trilogy
","The final film in the MATRIX trilogy and fans can breathe a sigh of release; (mostly) gone is the endless technobabble and philosophising of the middle film in the series, instead replaced by full scale action and resolution to the problems seen in the previous two films. This movie feels fresh and exciting because it offers us things previously unseen in the films. For the most part, this takes place in the ""real"" world, with only infrequent exertions into the computer-controlled fantasy world itself. It feels a lot stronger, gritter and harder than before because there is strong violence here, shocking bloodshed, and people really do die this time around. In many ways this makes it feel like more of an adult movie. Admittedly, things do start off a little strained. Although there is some good suspense and questioning in an isolated subway station, the action doesn't pick up until we get to a major gun battle in an S&M club.<br/><br/>This battle is actually a little disappointing, although it is good to see the character Seraph return to the screen. Then we're re-introduced to the slimy French villain from THE MATRIX RELOADED, and his stunningly buxom wife played by Monica Bellucci (no complaints here). Yet the suspense fizzles instead of crackles, and the most entertainment here is to be had from the performance of the Train Man (played by Bruce Spence, the crazy chopper pilot from MAD MAX 2). It's certainly underwhelming, and lots more pointless inactivity doesn't bode well for the rest of the film. Then things suddenly start happening – it begins with the stabbing of a nurse and ends with Neo fulfilling his destiny. There are shocks, genuine surprises, and a fantastically-depicted war between humans and machines. It involves people walking around in ALIENS-style power robots and shooting machine guns at thousands of those pesky silver fish-like flying robots and it certainly does not disappoint in terms of ferocity, impact, and absolutely stunning special effects work.<br/><br/>Things culminate in a scary, powerful finale involving Neo returning to the (now polluted) Matrix world to take on Agent Smith one last time. A fantastic and fitting conclusion to the lengthy battles in the earlier films, this strives to top them all. I loved the battle but bear in mind the kung fu is minimal compared to before. Performances are all assuredly good, with characters having by now settled into their parts, with top recommendations going to Hugo Weaving whose character of Agent Smith has major screen presence and makes for a threatening, frightening villain unlike last time. Basically I loved this movie and would be happy to re-watch it when the chance arrives. All three films are different, and very good indeed, so go check them out if you haven't done so already."

"arvind-ramaiya","9","0","2","19 February 2015"," My take on the matrix trilogy
","Here's my take on the matrix trilogy I have been trying to write this up for 12 years ever since I saw reloaded and revolutions, but its taken this long to figure out what really the matrix is. The director imagined a world with artificial intelligence. The machine world is not dated, so we have no idea if this is likely to be in the 21st century or 25th century. No one knows. They then wanted to create a movie based on their knowledge of the Vedas and created a set of characters based on Greek mythology and Hindu philosophy. The main theme of this movie is Humans Vs. Machines. They imagined that one day machines would be at a distinct advantage and that humans would be struggling to protect their planet. They also included numerous references to religion. Their idea in my opinion came from watching world war movies. They knew that world war 3 would not be nuclear, so in their imagination they created Sentinels. I have absolutely no idea how they thought of a human as a computer program and virtual reality. Ingenious, no doubt. They created the story well from Matrix v1. In v1, it was just about action and dodging bullets – no one would have understood anything but Hollywood fans would have wanted to watch v2. I think the brothers knew V2 and V3 had planned them before V1. Conceptually, the movie is about philosophy and psychology. The main theme is love. But why do they include references to religion (no Hinduism), was it deliberate to get the inquisitive audience. Were they trying to reach an audience who can think at a higher plane or was it just that they wanted to confuse everything and make a movie about love. There are numerous references to Zion, the holy land between Israel and Palestine. Did the brothers forget that the origin of life is from the Ocean. There are also many quotes from the bible, and many references to Buddhism. In my opinion, Buddha was a genius – Buddha re created what was already present in Vedas and started his own religion. The highway chases, martial arts and fighting aside the brothers did not imagine anyone to reverse engineer the script to find out the idea behind the matrix. I don't think the brothers wanted anyone to go read the Ramayana or the Mahabaratha, and in my opinion both these texts are fiction and just like the brothers wrote the matrix story, some other genius wrote the story behind these texts. Yes there is proof of a holy land in Sri Lanka but can you show me proof of flying monkeys or there is proof that a war happened at Kurukshetra but can you show me proof of Krishna and estimate the size of the armies. 5 brothers with a common wife against 100 evil brothers seems like a made up story to me. The director of the matrix movie expected his audience to be enthralled by the machine world vs. Humans war. Not by the infinite references to Greek mythology where the character names are derived or the Hindu philosophy of the one. Also the one has a guru in Hinduism, so this is clearly portrayed in the movie. I do not believe that the director of the matrix has read the texts fully – they just wanted to create a futuristic movie and mix up various subjects mostly mythology, psychology. They also wanted people to become more philosophical after watching the movie, a noble goal for Hollywood producers."
"panchodh_12","6","0","2","11 August 2014"," Way too much action and too little explanation
","I've watched the entire trilogy in three days, and now I clearly see why is only the first movie in the Top 250. When I watched it, I was amazed by it, and I desperately needed to watch the other two tosee how the story ended. But after doing it, I'm really disappointed. The plot behind the Matrix is so rich that it should have allowed the Wachowskis to come up with a better denouement. Not even that, if we consider The Matrix to be the exposition of the story (the Matrix is explained, we discover that Neo is the One), I think this exposition deserves a better rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement altogether (Yeah, I just looked up ""Dramatic structure""). And by better I don't mean more stopping bullets and millionaire visual effects, but an enrichment of the original story. J.K. Rowling, after the Sorcerer's Stone success, didn't limit herself to write six other books full of spell-casting and mythological creatures, but she rather developed a way more complex Wizards' world than the one illustrated in the first book. I honestly think that the Wachowsis should and could have done the same with The Matrix.<br/><br/>So this movie, together with the second one, is frankly disappointing. Take for example Zion's defense, which accounts for the biggest portion of this movie, even when the public knows from the beginning of Matrix Reloaded that humans have no chance against the machines. More or less the same happens with the climatic battle of Neo against Smith: whose idea was it that the dispute between the One, humans' only hope, and his nemesis, a rebellious and viral program that tries to conquer the entire world, could be resolved in a kung-fu battle? I mean, how on Earth can Neo defeat a guy that has billions of clones purely out of fists and kicks? Nevertheless, I must say that it is after all the useless fighting between Neo and Smith that we find what I think is the most interesting dialog in the movie. After Smith beats the s*it out of Neo (which we know from the beginning it would happen), Smith asks Neo why does he keep persisting, and Neo answers: ""Becaus I choose to"". This, together with the dialog between Neo and the Oracle earlier in the movie, suggest a nice conciliation for the recurrent problem between personal freedom (the essence of human existence) and fate, which is represented in the movie with the Oracle's ability to foresee the future, the Prophecy, and the fact that the Matrix is a logarithms-based world that tends towards perception. This theme appears across the entire trilogy, from the red and blue pills scene to the Architect's scene in Reloaded. In my review of Reloaded I mention how this theme is more clearly embodied in Morpheus' character, who insists on people's choices (""I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it."") and at the same time is the firmest believer in the Prohpecy and fate (""What happened, happened and couldn't have happened any other way"").<br/><br/>Now in this movie is where the Wachowkis solution to this problem is more clearly expressed: Destiny does exist, and Smith inevitably beats Neo (""inevitabilty"" is one of Smith's favorite words). But because Neo chose to be beaten up by Smith, the meaning of the act of Smith-beating-Neo changes and it now means Neo's sacrifice for Peace and Smith's defeat (there is also a lot of Ying-Yang in this, in how Smith is created out of Neo and how he's defeated out of co-opting Neo). Also the way in which the Oracle cannot see beyond people's choices, reminds me of the concept of restrained subjects, which refers to a Marx's quote in the 18th Brumaire:<br/><br/>""Men make their own history but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past."" <br/><br/>Neo didn't choose to be the One, but he can choose what to do with it, the way he chose to sacrifice himself in the end. That's what makes him human (as the Merovingian reminds to his thugs after he bleeds in a fight scene in Reloaded).<br/><br/>Of course I'm just over-thinking the tiny bits of this movie that are worth analyzing, and for the most part this is just explosions, fists and visual effects. And coming back to the beginning, The Matrix deserved a better epilogue than the empty scene with the Oracle and the Architect, full of vague phrases about not knowing how long the peace will last."

","The final part in 'The Matrix Trilogy' is the weakest among the three; the movie was quite predictable and had nothing new to offer. Self sacrifice is the main element of this part; many of the characters do so ""for the greater good"", including the Christ-figure, Neo. All of us knew where everything was headed to; this part seemed like a crude and half-hearted effort to wrap up the story. It's a satisfactory end to the storyline, but everything ends within a moment; there wasn't proper closure. The movie lacked heart and passion; it was just a lot of machines flying around and a lot of shooting. Even the final confrontation between Neo and Smith wasn't as spectacular as I expected it to be. When the people finally win, of course you are filled with joy, but that is to be expected when you've followed the story for so long.<br/><br/>Mary Alice as the new Oracle didn't have the same charm and presence of the original oracle, played by the Late Gloria Foster. Jada Pinkett Smith does get a larger role in this one (compared to the last), but it's just a lot of driving.<br/><br/>Overall, it becomes too preachy and religious by the end, which wasn't the tone it set out to have."

","The conclusion to the epic Matrix trilogy should have been the best of the three films. Everything was set up perfectly leading into a potentially exciting conclusion, and most of the film went as expected. There was terrific action and science fiction drama, some amazing special effects, and the legend of Neo continued to grow, right up until the conclusion. The end of the film went from extremely predictable to ridiculously strange and confusing. While I'm sure the ending made perfect sense to the Wachowski's, it made no sense to me, an avid science fiction fan and movie critic. This being a review, means I can't go into specifics, but the ending was absolutely horrible and puts the whole series in a different light. The most disheartening part of this whole thing is that until that point, the Matrix has been done to near perfection. The story was solid, the action was out of this world, the special effects were amazing, the casting was flawless, and just when the trilogy should have reached it's apex, it all comes crashing down. Once again the cast is terrific and the story is great, which is why I don't understand how they could give us an ending like that. I thoroughly enjoyed the Matrix trilogy and it will certainly hold it's place in cinematic history, but as a fan I was horribly disappointed by an ending that came out of nowhere and left the audience scratching it's head."

","I was awaiting Revolutions back in 2003 with keen curiosity. When watched however, there were many ""WTF?"" moments, and all-in-all I came out from the cinema kinda' disappointed. I despised the movie as bad, and let it be.<br/><br/>More than a decade later forced myself to watch it in the TV again, and almost simultaneously, I ran into a few sites which discussed the philosophical background and meaning of the seemingly garbage story.<br/><br/>And then it all came clear. Why Trinity and Neo had to die. Why the most important scene was the one at the subway station. All the counterpoints between Neo and Smith. Why Morpheus became a secondary character. Why the whole conflict HAD to end like that.<br/><br/>And frankly, your chance to realize all of that in a trilogy that has spanned for 4 years, are slim. Of course, there are core messages that you'll likely to receive on the first try, but the deeper meaning won't come down - at least for me - in that 2-hours time.<br/><br/>What makes even more difficult to understand this movie to the fullest is the selfish, tech-wanking action scenes with no purpose. Like the Club Hel ceiling-run, the demolition of the drill-head, or the defense of the bay-area with the exosuits. Of course, they were visually stunning, but gave little to the overall meaning and the story. Who cares for Kid, dammit, proceed with the story! I strongly suggest you to give a second chance to this movie, and before you do, read a few sites about it's meaning - like thematrix101-dot-com. You'll definitely enjoy those small revelations that escaped your attention at the first try.<br/><br/>7/10"
"lesleyharris30","6","0","2","13 June 2014"," Disappointing Conclusion to the Trilogy,
","The Matrix Revolutions is a decent movie with a good storyline and a great cast,although they all seem a lot less inspired than they did in the previous two Matrix films.The movie is certainly a disappointing ending to the trilogy,although Matrix Reloaded wasn't great either,it ended with such a great set up for what could have been a fantastic conclusion,but it was just mediocre at best.Both Matrix sequels came out in 2003,which means that they were obviously working on them at the same time,I think if they focused on the movies separately it would have been so much better,maybe just as good as the first one.There isn't a awful lot of Neo in this movie either,not until the end at least,which was a big mistake,Neo is the main character and making so much of it not focus on him was a bad choice.The Matrix Revolutions has its moments,but it's overall a disappointment,but you should still watch it only if you want to finish the trilogy. <br/><br/>The human city of Zion defends itself against the invasion of the machines.Neo fights to end the war between man and machine.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Laurence Fishburne"

","This is the best movie ever , and I like the story so much , all about this movie i like it<br/><br/>Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film."
"filmdwerper","10","0","4","15 May 2014"," Best for Last!
","The Matrix Revolutions is the perfect ending for a trilogy that started weak but turned out to be just fine.<br/><br/>Let me say that I think the first matrix movie was kind of boring and amateur-like. It seems that most people are sheep and like it to look smart, but the truth is real smart people like the second and third movie more. <br/><br/>I know people who studies philosophy and I have read all books by nietse, so I kind safely say that the second and third movie are more profound than the first movie.<br/><br/>In this last movie Neo goes full circle, fulfilling his prophecy. Meanwhile there is an epic sci-fi battle in Zion with a lot of very good drama and emotion. My favorite character in the movie was Neo because he has the coolest name and he is the main character.<br/><br/>Another thing I thought was really cool were the machines, but I was happy they stopped fighting in the end. The movie is way better then the first two because it has an happy ending. The themes and philosophical themes in the movie are way beyond anything you have ever seen just like the action scenes. I'm sometimes worried when I watch this movie that it might be zionist propaganda by the new world order because of the name of the main human city outside of the matrix. If you pay close enough attention you will notice it is called Zion just like zion in the word zionist, so watch out for the mind control. But if you can think for yourself you will not be affected by this possible propaganda and you will be able to have one of the best movie experiences ever.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like in this movie was Neo's girlfriend Trinity. I think it was bad casting in the first movie that made this a problem. The actress is not pretty enough to play the role of his girlfriend. This makes the love story very unconvincing for me. I thinkt the directer should have known better and should have instead cast a different actress for this role like kristen stewart or cameron diaz.<br/><br/>All in all I really recommend this movie. Don't bother watching the first two movies, they are a bore, and just an amateur-fest. If you like good movies, and you have a taste for cinema, then you will really like this movie.<br/><br/>Hope this was helpful."

The ultimate ending seems random. This is strictly to wrap things up. And they get to blow lots of stuff up in the CG world. The best part is the battle in Zion.

","Now the first movie in this trilogy was mind blowing. Unfortunately this is probably the weakest one in this trilogy. The build up has a lot of special effects going for it, but it just wasn't all that entertaining. The main part that actually stands out and is actually pretty darn awesome is the last 30 minutes. The final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith is memorable. Basically the whole premise of this movie is about the people of Zion preparing to stand their ground against the machines that found their location and is now ready to invade. And Agent Smith trying to take over and rule everything and Neo doing everything he can to stop him. But it's done in a very generic manner with some lame or corny dialogues, even the sci-fi philosophical aspects seemed cheesy. This just isn't a very satisfying movie as a whole but it's still a movie worth seeing, at least for the last 30 minutes. And I really like the soundtrack to this one as well and it fits right in with the Matrix world. Again it's a movie worth seeing but since the first Matrix movie was such a awesome sci-fi movie this one just seem to fall far behind.<br/><br/>6.4/10"

","The Matrix:Reloaded was good. Not as good as I would have liked, but good nevertheless. Revolutions was unfortunately many degrees below that standard. The feeling I got throughout the entire film was that the Wachowski's had the phrase ""wouldn't it be cool if..."" on their minds, and due to the success of the first film, nobody would stand up to them and say that, well, actually, it would be pretty cheesy. There are so many scenes that are just awful clichéd nonsense. I hope that in ten years time, as happened with the Highlander series, somebody will come along and pretend that these original sequels never existed and create some new ones following on from the first film.<br/><br/>Too many characters with too little substance.

So I sat down to watch Matrix Revolutions, and when it ended, I felt disappointed.<br/><br/>Matrix Reloaded set up a plot, and a conflict, so that this movie could resolve it, and while it does resolve, it doesn't get resolved very well. I know I'm not alone on this, how does that finale make any sense, I know the rumors, but those don't add up well either.<br/><br/>There are some very good action scenes in this movie, the battle of Zion is good for a while, and Neo vs. Smith was well done, even if it got a little tedious after a while.

This one tries too hard with the SFX and thrills, and it's understandable because the story lacks any reason and sense. Hugo Weaving was spectacular in the original as Agent Smith, but in this one the Wachowski brothers literally multiply the character infinitely; a desperately cheap attempt to outdo what worked so great for the original.

","OK, i am a pretty big Matrix fan, and i decided to write a small review for this particular movie because its the one film of the whole trilogy that seems to be looked down upon, but usually thats by those who simply don't understand it or the ending. these movies are not for the simple minded in my opinion. they seem to be geared towards ppl who like to think, ponder, and question films. i am not into science fiction......AT ALL. most of the movies i tend to enjoy are action and adventure, which i believe the matrix films could also fit into that category, but these films firmly belong i think to scifi, and its strange that i should love these movies so much. but they really are the only scifi movies that i enjoy, along with perhaps Terminator 2 and Independence Day. first and foremost, these movies are visually amazing, and particularly the 2 sequels, with the 3rd one being the big giant monster sized movie full of special effects, amazing action sequences, and flat out some of the coolest stunts your likely to ever see in this genre. plenty of eye candy, so to speak, and it is surely worth seeing if your any kind of action fan. the movie takes place right after the 2nd, and just takes off. neo must find out what he must to do save Zion and end the war, and the movie certainly has a apocalyptic feel to it. the big battle in Zion that has been hinted or talked about in the last 2 films finally arrives, and it does NOT disappoint. the humans, piloted in these huge metal me ch suits called APU's defend Zion in what is probably the best man VS machine battle in film history, with sentinels swarming everywhere like waves of water crashing down on the outnumbered humans, who surprisingly can hold there own against the machines pretty damn well with huge amounts of ammo being shot, and i mean HUGE. explosions galore, hovercraft's flying through sewers at incredible speed. we finally see the surface of planet, which is pretty amazing, even if it is taken over by machines. and then huge big battle between neo and smith as they fly through the air like supermen. the final fight between them is awe inspiring, the flying and rain/water effects, lightning, its just all like WOW, i cant believe they managed to make a fight between 2 guys flying around awesome and incredible! the movie has got a ton of this like comic book type action and the story, while some may not get it, is still very interesting and a fitting ending to this Awesome yet unusual action trilogy. i really enjoyed it and it looks AMAZING on blue ray and my hi-def TV. highly recommended if you want a pure knock your socks off action ride!"

","I think this is the most underrated, under-appreciated of The Matrix films, I really do. It has the most plot out of all the movies. I think the reason it's rated as low as it is, is because people watched The Matrix and loved the ground breaking action more than the plot. People want to see Neo fighting in The Matrix stopping bullets. Thing is is we get a super fight scene between him and Agent Smith. The main Agent Smith. I thought that was epic! Neo makes an ultimate sacrifice. It's heart wrenching for me. I understand that many people don't care about the machine fights as much, but it's supposed to be a war that needs a conclusion. A massive war that human beings are fighting for freedom. It's not all about The Matrix, it's about them freeing themselves from it. Freeing themselves from The Matrix, the prison, that which represents their slavery to the machines."

The final battle between Neo and Agent Smith was spectacular and awesome. But really, besides the fact that the film has some cool visuals, there wasn't anything too special about the third part. Besides the fact that it is never boring.<br/><br/>In the third film, Neo is trapped somewhere. He soon begins his journey to finish Agent Smith. Is that it? Well, no.

For instance, in the battle of Zion, you see battle weapons that are known as the mechs, know first off, these have no protection around the person operating it, that's just a little stupid because now the machines don't have to destroy the mechs, they just kill the people operating it. Second, they're using bullets....now this is the funny part. The mechs shoot bullets and when they run out they shut ""reload"". Then people who are waiting in a building somewhere deliver the bullets and are protected by people with, get this...energy weapons. Well why don't they use the energy weapons in the first place? Third, THE STORY WAS COMPLETELY CHANGED!!!!! If you look back at the second film, you'll notice that the architect said that if Neo doesn't go to the source, then there will be a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the Matrix, but Neo doesn't go to the source, but in the this film everything's fine and dandy and everyone's still there. Anyway, that was the horrible part so if you can sit through that, then i guess you can enjoy this film."

","How can a series of films that began in such good faith, underpinned by some staggeringly heavy philosophical theory (Jean Baudrillard's Simulacrum) and heart-stopping ground-breaking visuals (the 'bullet time' visual effects) end with this: the final instalment of the Matrix trilogy? After watching Matrix Revolutions I went back to the first film and realised that with some time, distance and a little bit of 'God, wow, I loved the bit when' we easily forget about the first film's wooden acting and its glittering bag of Hollywood prerequisites: a totally needless love interest, one man saving the whole world against all the odds, some unbelievably cheesy lines and a moment of 'happy ending'-ness that nearly ruined the whole gig SPOILER (Reeves is kissed back to life... *sighs* for God's sake). It is these things that repeat and outweigh all of the many positives of the third film.<br/><br/>We begin at the end-point of Matrix Reloaded: Neo the electronic knight is incapacitated; a new threat is descending on a weakened and somewhat demoralised rebel fleet and the new bad guy, the Architect, knows how this will all end as he has seen it. Ostensibly, we are watching a mix of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Betwixt all the action is a large and dense bag of philosophy and mysticism that inspires the mind and evokes conversation akin to those 'under the influence of choice' moments where we talk about what is real and what is perception. Unfortunately, we just can't see it in this film for all the running up walls and such.<br/><br/>The Architect, it turns out, is the antithesis of the Oracle, the former being the mathematical foundation of the matrix and the latter reading tea bags and frying our noodles with puzzling quotes like: Would you still have knocked over the vase if I hadn't mentioned it? They are pretty much the Ying and Yang of the matrix and are battling for peace the irony. Neo is the Oracle's main man and Agent Smith was the Architect's. Smith has now gone AWOL, has unplugged himself and is out for Neo, infecting other programs and making them into carbon copies of himself in order to build an army.<br/><br/>For me, there is too much time spent outside the matrix and in the real world where an unwinnable war between man and machine takes place in all its Independence Day glory. Cheesy quotes like: Your move. Give them hell. Damn, that woman can drive. and Goddamit are in abundance and the goddamed love story between Neo and Trinity blocks up the holes where the good stuff threatens to shine through. The rebel fleet never made sense anyway (when you recall Morpheus' tone and words to Neo in the first film), but by this point I was far past caring about being convinced; I just wanted out.<br/><br/>How to conclude? Overall, watch the first film again, ignore the cheese as best you can and then forget the next two films ever happened. Read Jean Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation and fry your noodle, because the Matrix: Reloaded and Revolutions will fail to do this for you on all counts."

","To sum up the Matrix trilogy in few words is easy for me: the first movie was kinda cool for the time, making way for all the wire-fu action sequences and slow-mo effects that many flicks would repeatedly make use of. The second movie was fairly poor quality and didn't make much sense - and the dancing sequence drove me nuts. But Matrix Revolutions is the enigma. On the one hand, it's not as bad as Reloaded, but on the other hand, it's devoid of purpose. It's just there.<br/><br/>The main problem is that Revolutions was made around the same time as Reloaded, which means it's almost as much of a mess as the second movie was. But then the movie is mostly fighting and special effects (no dancing sequences here like in Reloaded, so there's extra points right there). But then again, there was really no point to the fighting or the movie in general. Maybe there's something in the plot that didn't click with me, which is something that would be used as fodder for all the detractors, but if there's something that didn't click, then there's something wrong with the story that doesn't allow it to click. Perhaps if I paid more attention to the movie... perhaps if the movie had anything that would be worth the effort to pay any semblance of attention.<br/><br/>Revolutions isn't that bad of a movie if you take it in as a popcorn flick, but as a sci-fi epic or whatever it's supposed to be, it just doesn't work. Watch if you're a fan of the other Matrix flicks. Otherwise, avoid."
"maxmarvel65","6","0","2","23 December 2007"," Weaker than the original, better than Reloaded.
","Why? Simply because this movie seems to flow with a better storyline than Reloaded. This is the first time since the subway fight in the first movie that Agent Smith's scenes actually get suspenseful where, as opposed to Reloaded, it was basically Neo kicking his ass, thus taking out every thrill or suspense the viewer might have felt. As for the Oracle, I must say this time around, she actually gets a real place in the movie rather than telling Neo which direction he should take and then leave him right before Smith comes out of nowhere, just to have Neo kick his ass during 5 useless minutes.In Revolutions, her character actually finally gets good development and Mary Alice delivered a very good performance, as good as Gloria Foster would have done.<br/><br/>As for the bad things in this movie, the first thing that comes to my mind is Trinity's death. I can't understand why they needed to resurrect her in the second movie just to give her a lame death in the third one. Also, the over-exposure of too many characters, couldn't the brothers have limited themselves to Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, Smith and the Oracle? No, they needed to have pointless characters like The Kid(who probably said one of the most random lines: ''Neo, I have faith in you'' in the movie) or Niobe, who literally took the screen time that should have been given to Morpheus. I couldn't understand why there was so much focus put on those very secondary characters. You could also claim that it is of a tradition to fill 5 minutes of every Matrix sequels with a total stupid sex scene. In Reloaded, it was the Cave/Zion party scene, in this one, it was the Merovingian Club scene although I must admit that at list, the Club scene had a point to the story.<br/><br/>And for what I really liked, the fact that for the first time, a Matrix sequel really felt like what it should always feel, a war movie. And as for the final climax ending with Neo and Smith doing their super-epic-bigger-than-ever fight, it couldn't have been better."
"RichardKleiner","5","0","1","6 October 2007"," The weakest in the Trilogy
","This Matrix chapter was the most disappointing ever. In the first, we are left wondering what will happen to humankind after Neo finds out his true powers. In the second, we are left betrayed after finding out Neo isn't really ""the One"", but ""the Sixth"", and what will happen when he and the agent Smith possessed Bane next to him wake up. But this one, apparently wrapping it all up, almost makes no sense. As I was watching the ""How It should have ended"", several arguments were really right. If you're going to resurrect somebody, don't kill him again! There were good things, as always. Good effects, just OK. Nothing more. As the battle sequence fan that I am, I was thrilled watching the soldier machines we got a glimpse of in Reloaded, busting caps on the sentinels' asses while defending Zion. Davis does it again, and finally we can hear almost everyone of his cues on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, this time he makes a more generic music, though I liked Trinity Definitely and Navras. It was interesting how the Matrix no longer was the main scenery, having all of the action passed to Zion, so the title ""The Matrix"" no longer works. Yet,I found really bad things, too. More than before, than ever. First of all, the grand climatic fight. Neo vs. Smith. What a screwup! The Burly Brawl from Reloaded was a great idea, but they should have saved it for the last. After seeing countless Smith clones overwhelming Neo, saving himself by pure chance, you might think. ""Next time it's going to be worse!"" Well, it doesn't. When the whole Matrix is possessed by Smith, Neo fights only ONE, while the others are around just watching. And then, the fight goes extremely long and more over the top than ever, with no real conclusion. The ending was the worst. Neo dies (again), and when Mankind had lost thousands of lives to defend and eliminate the machines that have overrun them years before, by the will of Deus Ex-Machina, machines no longer hunt down humans. You might expect for the Matrix to be destroyed or something, and men would finally be free from that fake Wonderworld, but they don't. Machines simply don't hate humans anymore. WHAT THE HELL! So basically, we are left with the conclusion that Smith was the real enemy, even to the machines. So, ""the enemy of my enemy becomes my friend"". This totally proves that the Wachowski Brothers don't check and read their own scripts.<br/><br/>Stupid and pointless. Not even the effects were better than any previous two. The only productive asset for the weakest chapter in the Matrix Trilogy is only closure, and not a very satisfying one actually."

I find in a lot of high budget movies is that they are putting almost too much effort into it, as if they are telling everyone that this movie will be beyond all movies, there's nothing wrong with that, but just leaving it at that and using all their creative designs thinking about how their film can be better than the rest is a waste, during the production of something so incredible, they need to think about the originality, the characters, they need to make the characters original.<br/><br/>So as this money is being spent, I would actually prefer to watch something that is focused on the natural idea, I want to watch something that is incredible, something that keeps me on my seat, ignoring everything around me, as if I am actually transforming myself as another character, unknown to the rest of course, but I want to feel as though I am IN the design.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my point, being that, The Matrix is something that isn't being finished every year, it's not a movie that you see over and over, I think these films are something you watch just once and then stick the DVD in a gold case on your bedroom wall, and every time you look at it you remember the entire journey.<br/><br/>I hope that when people watch this, they wont think of it as being just like the rest, but completely different and heartfelt, as if they have just sat through a different life, I hope that they notice the details, and the emotion, as much as the characters and how gorgeous you think they look, look past them and see a story, a trilogy, that has something to it you most likely will never see again."

","The Matrix Revolutions picks up on the cliffhanger note Matrix Reloaded ended with, showing us the aftermath of Neo's decision to break the pattern of The Matrix  thus having his special powers become helpful both in reality as well as within the Matrix. This installment has a more religious tone, and portrays Neo's journey to the city of the machines in the real world as nothing less than a Christian epiphany (the comparison between Neo and Jesus is all but inevitable). While this thematic twist may request a large suspension of disbelieve on the viewer's behalf, the final battle between Neo and Smith; the ironic fact that both combating sides now have a common enemy (Smith); and the remarkable eye candy of the combat of the human resistance against the machines entering Zion  well, lets just say that all this more than compensates for this. Revolution is the most satisfying installment in The Matrix trilogy, if not plot wise, than at the very least visual wise."

","It is vain to retell these films, or this trilogy. But I would like to insist on the general structure of the world that is depicted in these movies.<br/><br/>There are three worlds. First of all the normal human world we know, New York essentially, that is in fact only an illusion created by the matrix, a program or a vast set of programs invented by the Architect who does not have any other identity and who pretends he is not human at the end. This illusion of a normal human world in which billions of people live has been created to simply control humanity in their growth, development, everyday life, etc. In other words we have a total digital dictatorship of which no human is conscious, well nearly no human is conscious. To keep this world in place and in peace the Architect has invented a set of Agents all called Smith, all similar, dressed the same, physically the same, etc, who have special powers to transport themselves at will where they want and to penetrate and possess any human being.<br/><br/>There is then Zion, the resisting human underground world in vast caves mostly artificial and with some kind of metallic skeleton. This world is human because the people living there are humans, but otherwise it is an artificial world, but it is managed by a council of representatives though we do not know how they are selected or appointed. Apart from this council the main institution is the armed forces since this underground world is under attack and in the midst of a war with the third world that seems to be in some kind of objective alliance with the matrix world. Note this human world is so cut off from the normal human, world, because of the matrix, that the only way is to jump from the underground world to the matrix world and the very few who can cross have to be plugged on some kind of digital program that transfers them, body and mind, to the over-ground world and yet keep their bodies underground, though they are then connected to the underground managing unit, though it seems this managing unit for that kind of transfer is on board of one vessel or ship that is some kind of space ship that can get out of the underground city and circulate outside though they cannot normally reach the matrix world and they believe they can't reach the third world.<br/><br/>The third world is the world of machines. Apparently they raise human beings to get their energy and thus fuel their machines. Only at the end the main hero Neo will reach Machine City and cast a deal with the representative of this machine world. That deal will enable Neo to get some kind of truce in the war that is raging at the very moment, then an alliance between the two worlds, Neo's and the machine world, against the Matrix because the Smith program has gone out of hand and the original agent Smith has multiplied to millions and has been able to simply take over the matrix world with only one clandestine link between the matrix world and the underground human world entirely controlled by a Frenchman, the Merovingian, who uses the Trainman and his train to smuggle things from one world to the other. With this alliance Neo is able to be sent to the matrix world that has become Agent Smith's world and to have the final fight with the original Agent Smith that will decide of the end.<br/><br/>The color of the matrix is green, like all the lines of codes on the computer screens, lines that work from top to bottom and then it is not clear if it is from left to right or from right to left. Green is the matrix color, though the Architect is dressed is some light creamy white suit. The illusion of a human world created by the matrix is multicolored like our own human world. The underground human world is highly dominated by brown and all brownish shades of brown, and there are quite a few: the people are vastly diverse in ethnic origins and heritage. They are dressed in all shades of brown, with an alternative light grey. Agent Smith is dressed in black and is white, a color intending to imply we are dealing with a very pure white world. He is dressed in black and wears black glasses more like some kind of blind man than sunglasses. Finally the machine world is all kinds of dark grey and black but with systematic red eyes because these machines have red eyes, have eyes. At the end it is revealed that blind Neo is able to see this machine world as pure light from white to bright yellow and bright orange. []<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","For a movie which was mostly not set inside the Matrix itself, the team has pulled off something really incredible. Yes, there are few boring and annoying scenes which can be appreciated on the 10th viewing or so, which make you tear your hair out and scream for the action scenes but when the latter does come and you have a home theatre or are seeing this movie in the cinema, you will be heavily rewarded. The defence of Zion is one thing I'll really remember. The final fight scene is a bit idiotic though, even though the special effects for it are great.

The pace of the film overall is kinda slow(in comparison to the other two again)..and there aren't many twists and turns,because the story follows the basic lines that were laid in the previous editions.But I just cant see how people don't like the ending.THIS Isn't A FAIRY TALE FOR GOD SAKES..YOU CANT EXPECT ENDINGS TO BE HAPPY ALL THE TIME!!The end when it came,was inevitable(as agent smith might say..)and perfectly justified.If it was just like every other movie,i'd bet it would've ended with the scene in which the Hammer detonates its EMP and destroys all the sentinels in the dock.THEN i would've given it a 2 star rating or somethin..(And you guys would've probably given it ten!)

","**** No real spoilers, but of course since I hate spoilers, a tiny line in my review may be regarded as one, so be warned ****<br/><br/>I read another user review that very accurately stated one's expectation in terms of the ""kind"" of film they are going to see in REVOLUTIONS will determine their opinion of it more so than its content. I completely agree, and though that may seem obvious, this film has been so horribly under-appreciated and criticized due to wrongful or misguided expectations. I think it's an absolute gem and now, having seen it again about 3 years after seeing it during the opening weekend, I am even more fond of it.<br/><br/>The story of The Matrix and all the layers within the main arc is a wonderful story. The first film was truly about belief, and believing that you are powerful and capable of what you believe you are capable of. It had a great message, and then of course RELOADED took us deeper into the world of The Matrix itself, increasing our understanding of just how much more there is to all of it. I believe what happened was a bit of the message of the first film was lost on audiences as it was slightly missing from the sequel, which focused on the plot of the free humans vs. machines itself far more. However, here comes REVOLUTIONS, bringing us right back to the concept of belief, and even more so, the ongoing dispute between logic vs. faith. The Architect is of course a program of complete logic, whilst the Oracle is evidently faith-based. This is alluded to throughout the film, and the film progresses along these opposing ideas, with a fantastic scene where Neo enters the machine world and engages ""belief"" from the most unlikely possible source (something many have missed).<br/><br/>And what can I say about the CGI and SFX overall? Absolutely unbelievable. I have watched the great battle sequence between Zion and the squids many times now, and it still blows my mind. The level of detail is unmatched in any other action sequence(s) that I have seen in any films. The quality of the CGI and the intertwining of live-action humans with the CGI is breathtaking, and the sound effects are extremely well-done. 3 years later, I have seen several of the big-budget effects-heavy films, and none hold a candle to what this film offers. There is so much in here to enjoy and to make repeat viewing a pleasure.<br/><br/>9/10"

","What kind of art doesn't give you something to think about? The climax was just too unexpected for words and quite a doozy but not unbelievable. Part of me was expecting Larry and Andy to pull something like this. The climatic fight was so beautiful. The moves, the cinematography, the score, the background, ALL OF IT GREAT!!!! It was so apocalyptic and epic. Why don't people like this film more if not for just the fight alone? As for the rest of the film, it kind of got off to a slow start but I like the club scene and some interesting ideas regarding the nature of programs and emotions were given a long overdue treatment that is not appreciated enough. I don't really see the dialogue as ponderous. I see it as going into new territory regarding Neo's destiny and the increasing stakes. Keanu Reeves really makes us feel the weight and torment of Neo. Neo didn't want to be a hero and it would be easy for him to say that he was put in a position where he had no choice. But ""Because I choose to"" has become a immortal line for me. The Neo/Trinity romance I find bittersweet. Morpheus is put on the sidelines but he is still integral while background characters are given roles to play in the ultra-chaotic Zion battle which is think is quite original. I believe that Oscar nominations were robbed from John Gaeta (awesome visual effects), Zach Staenberg (the meticulous production designer), Don Davis (his spiritually exciting score) and Bill Pope (every shot of his is like a painting on canvas, I love him). So even though it may not be everything you expected just remember there is no spoon and you will find much to enjoy."

"paul2001sw-1","5","0","1","9 July 2006"," The Matrix Imploed
","'The Matrix' was a film that rehashed many of the corniest ideas, and re-used much of the most familiar aesthetics, of science fiction; but it stitched them together into a package so breathtakingly implemented that few people noticed, or if they did notice, cared. Then the sequel came out and the backlash begun. I actually thought that 'The Matrix Reloaded' was not too bad given the film it was trying to be: in other words, it's hard to imagine how such a sequel could have been much different (I also thought the original was good but not great). But among devotees of the first film, I think the real crime of the second film was to expose the emperor's clothes in the first movie: often fantasy stories hint at a complete world, glimpses of a wider mystery, and 'The Matrix' was no exception; but a second film spent reworking the same ground served only to expose how little was actually there in the first place. By the time of the third movie (made together with the second, and released soon after), expectations were lower and criticism was less; but in fact, the first half of 'The Matrix Revolutions' is undoubtedly the worst part of the trilogy, with its incomprehensible plot and misguided attempts to squeeze the wooden romance between Keanu Reeves' character Neo and Carrie-Ann Moss's Trinity for more than it is worth. Later on, things pick up a bit, and the special effects are spectacular as ever, but the Wachowski brothers clearly have no truck with the maxim that ""less is more, and by the time of the film's conclusion, the movie is completely unplugged from any sort of narrative sense. What was fresh and original when the first film came out is tired and bombastic by the end of part three. And that's a shame."

Honestly, it has been a while since I have seen this, so bare with me if I miss out on some of it.<br/><br/>Anyways, what they did wrong was create an idea of a coup de tat in a world that has not been explained nearly enough. Instead of answering questions, they created new ones.<br/><br/>Then there is the whole machines vs. humans, which is just cheesy. The machines easily out numbered the humans.<br/><br/>Then finally, there is the whole new understanding of 'the one.' Honestly, I could care less why he existed. Seems to be an anomaly (wow, spelling) in the Matrix. But him being a mistake doesn't explain why the agents are trying to take over. And they say that Neo must die in order to save everybody (cuz there were more than one 'one'). All of that is lame, I'm sorry.<br/><br/>And the whole fight in the absent street in the rain was cool, but really not ground breaking.<br/><br/>OK, I didn't want a huge war, I didn't want an attempt on a coup de tat, I didn't want to find out why he is the one.<br/><br/>I'd rather them have to destroy the matrix by pulling a plug or something.<br/><br/>Please, if you have not seen any of the Matrix movies... watch the first one only.

","With The Matrix Revolutions, The Matrix trilogy, begun in 1999, comes to an explosive conclusion and generally corrects course from the slightly underwhelming Matrix Reloaded sequel to bring the series back into fighting form. Some outstanding issues are still present that stops Revolutions short of matching the original Matrix, but it comes pretty close.<br/><br/>Picking up right where The Matrix Reloaded left off, Revolutions finds Neo (Keanu Reeves) trapped in a limbo, realized as a train station, between the machine world and The Matrix. Meanwhile, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) are in search of Neo, consulting the Oracle (Mary Alice), who has been forced to alter her appearance (actress Gloria Foster, who portrayed the role in the first two films, had died in the interim). She directs them to the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) who reveals that Neo is trapped in his limbo, run by the Trainman (Bruce Spence). Upon freeing Neo, the battle begins heating up in the real world, with the machines almost to Zion, where the humans have massed all their might to hold them off. Neo realizes what path he must take to save Zion, while Morpheus and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) head back in the direction of Zion to help defend it from the machines. Meanwhile, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) is nearing his almost total control of the Matrix, and his presence begins to threaten even the machines themselves.<br/><br/>Where The Matrix Reloaded was the plot developing middle chapter of the trilogy, Revolutions is the grand epic finale, concluding with multiple major action sequences of a magnitude not seen in any of the Matrix films to date. Among the most significant is the machine siege on Zion, a whirlwind of visual effects that are as captivating as the sequence is exciting. Others have criticized this segment of the film, claiming it is just a computer game blown up to the big screen, but it is little different from the massive computer generated armies and battle sequences from the Star Wars prequels, so to dismiss it seems foolish. The quality of the effects is top notch, among some of the most detailed computer generated sequences realized to date, and while films shouldn't just be eye candy, this sequence also manages to capture the sense of desperation as the humans make their final stand against the machines. Occasionally, when the size of the tale calls for it, imagery on this grand of a scale is necessary.<br/><br/>In fairness to the criticism of Revolutions, the film does not entirely pay off the elements set up in Reloaded. Once again, there are a lot of ideas on display in Revolutions, but it is difficult for writers-directors Larry and Andy Wachowski to completely tie everything up. Some aspects of the overriding plot are also left vague, but it may very well be on purpose, to give the viewer an opportunity to come to their own conclusions. Even so, there is some lingering questions that a little tighter screen writing would have helped with.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, everyone still delivers as necessary. Reeves continues to turn in a sufficient performance as Neo, Carrie-Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne are dependable, and Hugo Weaving gets some of his best material as agent Smith. There are not standouts, but everyone is serviceable.<br/><br/>With The Matrix Revolutions, the Wachowski brothers have brought their epic science fiction trilogy to a close, and while it may have dropped off a bit from it's strong start, The Matrix trilogy is still a challenging and entertaining masterwork, and should not be dismissed as callously by some as it has. Only time will tell the lasting power that this series may contain."
"vedicsignature","8","0","1","27 January 2006"," Matrix revolution is full of symbolism
","The Matrix, named ""Matrix Revolution"". A movie not meant for common people due to UN-common amount of philosophy. The most interesting part of the movie is the amalgam of different religious thinking. Neo, the hero itself live like Jesus. He speaks Buddhism while direction of movie is all Hinduism. The concept of Karma, the UN-common yet expected ending of movie was all part of it. Like Lord Brahma re-initiating the whole world in every day of his, like Lord Shiva being the mean of destruction of the whole world, the architect and the Oracle plays the same role. In the end nobody wins, its the END the EXPECTED end, ""Everything that has a beginning has an end"". In the end matrix is Re-Loaded, same way as Lord Brahma creates a new world after the end of first one.<br/><br/>Though pro-founded, the directors eventually show it by final view of architect machine as lotus. The directors haven't stopped there. They talk about the nature of Maya or matrix by the mouth of none other then Evil Mr Smith. Mr Smith in his last communication pitied human race with his knowledge of Srimada' Bhagwat Gita. He further realize that all of this has happened before too. Again a clear indication, that there is nothing new happening, what so ever happens is predefined or pre-devised, CHOICE itself is an illusion. Our life is itself bounded by almighty matrix of Lord Brahma.<br/><br/>But then what is the purpose( of life)? For rest of us its the karma, we do what we do because we are all bounded by the nature of Karma and Maya.<br/><br/>How do hero differ? A hero, or a free person, or an enlighten person differ by his understanding of basic nature of Maya. The knowledge of this help him to device his work according to his will. Alternatively this signify that to have a scenario like ""I did this, because I want to this"", we have to understand and realize the nature of Maya without which, all action are just a predefined algorithms.<br/><br/>Matrix revolution is full of symbolism. The event of Neo becoming of capable of ""Inner Light"" of object symbolize the concept of ""Divya Dristi"". In Gita, Lord Krishna told Arjuna that his real form cannot be viewed his eye. Lord gave him ""Divya Dristi"" by which he no longer sees him, in normal form but only his incomprehensible form.<br/><br/>Mr Frenchman is king of our time. Time which is control by money , power and lust. While true love can give us Moksha', lust on other hand take us to deepest dungeon of Maya. The Frenchman control everything in this world, and hence wants the Maya to be everlasting. He understand that he only reins till the time people are slave of Maya.<br/><br/>Its interesting to see, how Sati the little girl has been used to identify the link between human AI programs. Sati who is better half of Lord of destruction, Shiva, re-incarnates her as Parwati taking birth in a human family.<br/><br/>Other than the usual philosophy doses, one thing really amuses me, is the destruction of Mr Smith. Programmatically Neo as being the anomaly itself and Mr Smith being result of the anomaly justifies the end. If the source is finished the resultant anomalies will also become non-existent.<br/><br/>Philosophically it means eventually all bad thing arose from good thing. Like Adam and Eve were thrown out of heaven due to knowledge. Ultimately the knowledge led to downfall of Menkind. Confusing? isn't it? Will it lead to indecisiveness? I will have to agree. But if the world is a matrix and everything that happened in it is a game played by creator and destroyer, then we already have reason to be in state of inaction.<br/><br/>I believe this is where Srimada' Bhagwat Gita starts."

I wish Carrie-Anne Moss had more to do, same goes for Laurence Fishbrune however, Keanu and others carried the film really well, and, the gun and machine battles were fantastic!, plus the opening train sequence was simply fascinating!.

Keanu Reevs is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, he gives his best performance in the series (in my opinion), is focused, had great chemistry with Carrie once again, looked damn cool, and was really into his role, he was amazing! (Keanu Rules!!!!!!). Carrie-Anne Moss is beautiful and did what she had to do well, and had good chemistry with Reeves once again, however her role was pretty thankless here, she still rocked though (Carrie rules!). Laurence Fishburne is not his usual fantastic self because he has nothing to do, but stand there and do nothing, and spurt out dialog, not much of a part, really thankless role. Hugo Weaving is AMAZING here as Agent Smith, he is at his most intense here as Smith, and was extremely menacing and lovable! (Weaving rules). Mary Alice does a great job replacing Gloria Foster as the Oracle i liked her lots. Jada Pinkett Smith is way hot, and does excellent with what she had to do once again, and had good chemistry with Fishburne. Harold Perrineau Jr. is great as Link once again i liked him lots. Nona Gaye is good as Link's lover, and did what she had to do well. Monica Bellucci(Persephone),Helmut Bakaitis(architect),Harry J.

","Say what you will about The Matrix Revolutions, but you certainly cannot call it short on ideas or ambition. Picking up immediately after the finale of Part 2, Revolutions continues the odyssey of Neo, his spiritual adviser Morpheus, his leather-clad, ass kickin' girlfriend Trinity, and the soon-to-be-demolished stronghold of humanity known as Zion. There are, of course, numerous colorful side characters, most of whom figure quite prominently in the final battle between man and machines - none cooler than the rogue Agent Smith, now an all-powerful computer virus hell-bent on devouring everyone it comes across. Which is apparently a whole lot of people.<br/><br/>When attempting to 'synopsize' a Matrix film, one can take two different routes: keep it short and sweet as an acknowledgment to the film's labyrinthine plot developments - or pen a massive and sprawling dissertation on the film and its myriad (and lofty) conceits. I choose the former route, as the element of discovery is one of the series' sweetest plums, plus I quite simply don't have the brains or energy to catalog everything the Brothers Wachowski have on their minds.<br/><br/>Suffice to say that The Matrix Revolutions (much like its predecessors, only to a slighter lesser degree) is overstuffed with slick action set pieces, thought-provoking sci-fi mind-benders and cool characters dressed in slick leather and torn sweaters. If Parts 2 and 3 don't seem to measure up to the lofty groundwork laid in the original film, I suspect much everyone's relative ""disappointment"" in the sequels perhaps stems from unfair expectations and not the dazzling pieces of entertainment offered up on screen. (If The Matrix Reloaded didn't have those ""boring"" moments of self-reflection, it would end up being derided as ""mindless action"" - proof positive that filmmakers are often damned if they do and damned if they don't.)"

","The third and (hopefully) final chapter of The Matrix Trilogy is just as overloaded and plodding as the previous, from Razzie nominated director brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski. If you remember the last one, Neo (Keanu Reeves) saved Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and doing so has ended up stranded in a train station between the two worlds, and only Trinity can get him out. Anyway, the war against the machines is still raging on, and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Link (Lost's Harold Perrineau) are travelling through the systems to drop the big bomb to hopefully kill enough of the machines, or end the war. Neo and Trinity meanwhile are heading to machine central so Neo can try and make peace, oh, by the way, he is blinded (but still able to see), and Trinity dies in his arms after a crash. The concluding scenes are Neo's final battle with Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), while all his clones just watch, and it turns out that he just needed to let Smith take his body over, and then they all blow up. What!? Also starring Mary Alice as The Oracle (replacing Gloria Foster who died from diabetes), Monica Bellucci as Persephone, Collin Chou as Seraph, Anthony Wong as Ghost and Licence to Kill's Anthony Zerbe as Councillor Hamann. Just like the previous film the performances are not as believable as the first film, there are too many things to be focusing on both in the story and on screen, sure the special effects can't be faulted, but do they really need that many? Imagine how it cost them to make. Worth watching!"

","The third part of the Matrix trilogy does not excel in the originality of the plot; you already know what will happen more or less if you have seen part 1 & 2. However the attack on Zion and the several chasing scenes make up for this! The massive firefights in the dock are absolutely awesome, as is the chase of the hovercrafts. I have watched the Dock scene like 20 times :)<br/><br/>The confrontation between Neo and Smith is the only drawback of the third part. The superhero-like fight is not very interesting and the outcome is predictable. This scene could definitely have been executed in a better way."

","The first one was breathtaking.<br/><br/>The Second one was fun.<br/><br/>The third one fell on it's face.<br/><br/>One good thing i'll say is that this film qualifies as penance. See it and your sins are forgiven for having put yourself through that torture. Just whip yourself instead, it'll be more productive...<br/><br/>First, two thirds of the flick take place in what has got to be the most boring part of the Matrix Universe, the real world.<br/><br/>Second, the RIP OFF the lobby shootout from the first film, and they even rip off Trinity's Crane kick. Way to be original, guys.<br/><br/>A lot of people hated the ending, i didn't care for it, but i got what they were trying to get across. It was pretty original and really the only good thing about this tripe, the problem is the 90 or so minutes leading up to the ending are so boring that i could barely stand it. There is one fight (called The Siege of Zion) that, i kid you not, is like 40 minutes long. It just drags on and on (and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on).<br/><br/>The VERY end is worth it (it has a great fight called the super-brawl, though not as great as the burley brawl, and it doesn't end in any predictable way), but THAT is why i feel comfortable giving this film one star. The tedium leading up to that fight had me seriously considering making a break for the exit.<br/><br/>See it if you MUST, but i wouldn't waste my time."
"optimisticvince","9","0","1","10 May 2005"," How on earth could people be disappointed by this film...
","Matrix Revolutions is not Matrix III, for that reason, the Matrix movies represent a true trilogy.<br/><br/>First a short summary of the state of art at the beginning of this this film:<br/><br/>-the world has been surprised by the first movie, the action scenes, even if it was copy were fantastic to watch, the Sci-Fi theme, even if often debated was discussed from a different point of view, the casting was really promising and the main thing, people get directly attract like into the film (who did not think about himself when Neo discovers the Human fields). <br/><br/>-very expected due to Matrix, Matrix reloaded was rejected by many persons in the audience. From my point of view it is a good thing because the first who get disappointed where the brainless spectators wishing only to see a ""fight-movie"". I would say we can criticized a clear thing: the boring trend of the Wachoski brothers in this second OPUS to longer scene with no real interest (the fight against the thousand Smith agents, the motorway scene, ...). But for me , the quality of this one was equal to the first one, the case is people were disappointed because they were not surprised as for the Matrix.<br/><br/>For these two reasons precited, I think that the number of persons who went to cinema for Matrix Revolutions was not as high as expected after the first OPUS. When I see and re-see this Matrix Revolution, my only conclusion is, I would not have expected a better scenario, a better fight scene against the machine...<br/><br/>In the trailer I was thinking, how exciting will be the scene under the rain when you see Neo and the Agent Smith walking under the eyes of billions of Smith copies. I was not disappointed a second. I don't want to deal to much with the story, by respect for those who have not seen this film already, nevertheless, the end of Neo, the beauty of the feeling make me understand that this film can clearly raise philosophical, sophisticated questions. I heard from here people thinking "" bullshit, it is just a weird meaningless film"", in that case, isolate yourself from the world and watch again the three movies in one evening and the truth will jump to your eyes (barbarisme)...<br/><br/>Between Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions, I dreamt many nights about how will be the end, since I have seen Matrix Revolutions, I dream many nights about how will be my end. And this is not cinema.<br/><br/>Cheers,"
"Temascos","10","0","1","9 May 2005"," A fantastic conclusion. My favourite in the trilogy!
","I love this film.<br/><br/>Everyone knows what the story is about now so I'll comment on specific scenes. The film begins where Reloaded left off, on Roland's hovercraft 'The Hammer' where the 'Neb' survivors are scratching their heads after their failure to end the war in Reloaded. Neo is still in a coma but is soon discovered to be jacked into the Matrix, where Smith is assembling his true power.<br/><br/>Before I continue, I gotta counteract some of the ridiculous claims about the film: ""It has no story""- What? Neo has to save Zion and all humanity before it is too late. Were these people paying attention? ""Too similar""- Duh. It's a sequel! Bet you would find 'Pirates of the Caribbean 2' too similar or would you? Anyway, battle sequences in this film are radically different than the previous films, from the epic war zones to the fisticuffs. Each scene is directed with absolute reachability. Everyone remembered the first film for it's fights, Revolutions blows them away.<br/><br/>Acting as well is of critical importance, whilst many detest Keanu I think he is an excellent (No pun intended) actor when given the right script, and whilst there are many extras characters still have a memorable edge to them, top marks to Hugo Weaving, NO ONE can deny that! I could go on, but I advise that you watch all 3 films again to see what you may have missed at the cinema, largely because you are not spoon fed (Because there is no spoon.).<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","First off... I loved the two movies prior to this one! But come on!!! The story has NO relevance to the other ones. In reloaded Neo suddenly has the ability to destroy the machines outside the matrix! I immediately realized that the machines had created another Matrix to control those who were not able to stay in the Matrix (related to the story told in the end about the people who cannot live in the ""perfect"" world)<br/><br/>All the signs are there, The man(agent)who wants to kill Neo also becomes unconscious, so u would think that he has pulled neo out into the REAL world, and the story will continue!<br/><br/>The reason why the Matrix became SO popular is because it is based on principle philosophical ideas created by Plato.

","At the stunning conclusion of The Matrix Reloaded, Neo (KEANU REEVES) took another step forward in the quest for truth that began with his journey into the real world at the outset of The Matrix - but that transformation has left him drained of his power, adrift in a no man's land between the Matrix and the Machine World. While Trinity (CARRIE-ANNE MOSS) holds vigil over Neo's comatose body, Morpheus (LAURENCE FISHBURNE) grapples with the revelation that the One in which he has invested a life's worth of faith is merely another system of control invented by the architects of the Matrix.<br/><br/>In The Matrix Revolutions, the final explosive chapter in the Matrix trilogy, the epic war between man and machine reaches a thundering crescendo: the Zion military, aided by courageous civilian volunteers like Zee (NONA GAYE) and the Kid (CLAYTON WATSON), desperately battles to hold back the Sentinel invasion as the Machine army bores into their stronghold. Facing total annihilation, the citizens of the last bastion of humanity fight not only for their own lives, but for the future of mankind itself.<br/><br/>But an unknown element poisons the ranks from within: the rogue program Smith (HUGO WEAVING) has cunningly hijacked Bane (IAN BLISS), a member of the hovercraft fleet. Growing more powerful with each passing second, Smith is beyond even the control of the Machines and now threatens to destroy their empire along with the real world and the Matrix. The Oracle (MARY ALICE) offers Neo her final words of guidance, which he accepts with the knowledge that she is a program and her words could be just another layer of falsehood in the grand scheme of the Matrix.<br/><br/>With the aid of Niobe (JADA PINKETT SMITH), Neo and Trinity choose to travel farther than any human has ever dared to go - a treacherous journey above ground, across the scorched surface of the earth and into the heart of the menacing Machine City. In this vast mechanized metropolis, Neo comes face to face with the ultimate power in the Machine world - the Deus Ex Machina - and strikes a bargain that is the only hope for a dying world.<br/><br/>The war will end tonight, with Neo's destiny and the fate of two civilizations inexorably tied to the outcome of his cataclysmic confrontation with Smith."

","If you liked the ingenuity and atmosphere of the original Matrix, my advice is: don't watch this copy-paste shoot-em-all piece of film. It's simply very boring. My guess is that around 70% of the running time is like watching a Nintendo play some demo of a game all by itself. Thousands of little squish-like monsters are attacking all over, while the good guys are trying to blast them. The little romance and human side of the plot gets stuck in your throat, just doesn't fit into the rest of the flick.

","The most disturbing feature of this last installment is that it is very 'disturbing'... to our eyes, to our minds and most important, to our expectations. It was quite evident in ""Reloaded"" that the end will not be as fun as the start. But I thought at least there'd be something to watch, as in Reloaded. Well, ""Revolutions"" have got some stunning visuals (for those who don't know!) but they are no longer soothing to the eyes. Why waste bucks on special effects and stuff when people can't watch it? Cluster of machines swarming over underground city, in the same fashion and shown from same angles, it got so freakishly boring. And the last Neo-Smith fight? it looks good in trailers, not in the movie that shows it for ten minutes or so.<br/><br/>The story, perhaps was not so bad altogether. There are few surprises hopefully to save my investment behind the matrix saga. The ending is done well, though basically rubbish as an idea. The one positive point of this movie that it at least sticks to a basic path, not wandering wild as in Reloaded. It should have been so, because there were so many questions to answer.<br/><br/>It's easy to say ""It could be better."" but the fact is it couldn't. I believe the modern cinema technology is still not enough to create a satisfactory ending of the Matrix, even with good ideas. And also, probably, the goals of the producers got changed after the success of the first. It's promises for intelligent food for thought must have been compromised for financial success. But it turns out as an overdose of this decision."

","The Matrix Revolutions is a film unlike any other. Not even it's two predecessors. I for one, voted 10 on all three films of this fascinating trilogy. I'm not going to re-hash the story in my comment. You all know it. The death of Neo at the end of the film was one of the great moments of film. Not because Keanu Reeves' character died, but because of one man's simple want for peace, and his willingness to go anywhere, and do anything for it. Neo was a true hero. The peace achieved in this film was beautiful. It brought me to a sense of realization that peace is what needs to be strived for in our own reality. While all three films' action sequences and fights were miraculous, the peace here is the underlying meaning. The Wachowski's threw it at us full blast. In the midst of all the fighting, and bloodshed of the war, there was finally peace. Which shows us that we're too preoccupied with war and fighting to appreciate the simplicity and the bliss of peace."

","I don't understand why they would end it that way after having several characters escape death. I think it is ironic that characters that should have lost their lives remain while characters that should have lived actually died. The fight scenes were good, but not as good as the 1st and 2nd Matrix movies. It seems as though they put too much fighting outside of the matrix in this movie, but then again it is a real war between the humans and the machines.<br/><br/>Did they leave it open for a sequel or spin off movie?

In order for the Matrix series to grow the films had to evolve, and though this was my least favorite of the films I think that the direction they took was necessary. there was a good balance of action and drama in this movie. It may have been a little long for some, but there was so much to cover. The rabbit hole was deeper than people were willing to go, and that's the beauty of the whole Matrix philosophy. Life is not always what we expect and the same goes for movies. The first movie was a masterpiece the second was very close and the third was good enough to leave me satisfied.

","Possible spoilers<br/><br/>After all the negative comments about Revolutions, I didn't have much hope for it when I popped the DVD in the player. I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Most people don't understand what's going on in the Matrix movies. They liked the dynamics, 'bullet time' slomo and cool style of the first one, more or less grounded in our world, then were disappointed greatly by Reloaded, and ignored Revolutions in droves.<br/><br/>I didn't like Reloaded much either, but thats another movie. Revolutions, on the other hand, is more my cup of java. They had a difficult casting problem with the death of the Oracle (Gloria Foster), and they managed an adequate 'patch' to their program. The Matrix is quite a bit like a computer program all the way through. In Revolutions, the final battle pits Neo against Smith (again) in the ultimate superhero-style battle. Any comic book fan should enjoy the fight sequence between them, but most people miss that that particular Agent Smith was really the Smith/Oracle, who at the critical moment does an interrupt of Smith's program and gives Neo the way in, so that main computer can delete the Agent Smith program (at the end of the fight in the crater). That is why Neo had to go to the machine city, so he could get plugged into the matrix at its mainframe core, or bus as it were, so the mainframe would get hooked directly into Agent Smith. Some of that stuff reminds me of the old movie Tron.<br/><br/>I'm a pretty crappy Mech game player but I really like the whole Mech thing, so the huge Siege battle with the Mech 'APU's lined up and fighting the losing fight against the hordes of Sentinels warmed my Target Lock and HUD display. A truly awesome display of combining multiple technologies to get something believable and lots of it on the screen.<br/><br/>I don't quite get the meaning of the 'Den of BDSM' and why the Merovingian hangs out there, unless the old file server just likes all his porn and it was an excuse to get Bellucci in a revealing red leather/latex outfit, and local BDSM shops had sales that week so it was an economical thing to do. Or it could be that being French says it all about the Merovingian and that was really decadent digital hell, as the mythical Persephone/Bellucci would indeed spend half her time there. Her only line was on perceiving Trinity's love for Neo, and thus underlined her own deal with the devil.<br/><br/>Of course there's lots of wirework in this movie. All the actors clearly worked hard, as it is a very physical movie. The acting is so-so. Hugo Weaving aka Elrond as Agent Smith is my favorite. The Matrix trilogy is deeper than most give it credit for.<br/><br/>The DVD presents the movie very well. You can see the actors pits, pores and goobles in great detail, and the audio works out all the speakers. There's a Making Of that I would've liked a lot more if the crew didn't spend so much time pimping their work. The DVD gets a high 8/10"
"MLDinTN","Null","0","1","15 November 2004"," dull ending
","I can't decide if the third film was better than the second. Both were not too good. The biggest complaint with this one was the solution to the war between man and machine. It was dumb and simple, and didn't make a whole lot of sense. It had so many CGI effects and no plot. What was the point of Jada Smith. It mainly showed her sitting down piloting a ship. And it didn't even make sense why they had to go the hard way to get to Zion. Plus, the ship kept hitting everything and still kept going. And Trinity was a waste in this film. Her character was so great in the first film. And why waste Monica Belluci. I don't think she even said anything in this movie. The Trainman was dumb. It was supposed to be an obstacle for Neo to overcome, and all he does is get on the subway when it comes by the second time. Real suspenseful, huh!<br/><br/>And the final fight between Neo and Mr. Smith was silly. Why do they keep hitting each other when they both have superhuman strength. And when Neo turns into an agent but then isn't one anymore. That made no sense. So, some how in the real world the machines kept Mr. Smith from taking over Neo in the Matrix. I really have no idea.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It's awful that they turned such a great movie as the Matrix into a very generic, boring trilogy. If you really want to see how the story ends, then go ahead and watch it. You really couldn't be more disappointed after the second movie. But, if you have only seen the first Matrix, then I recommend stop there and don't let the last 2 sequels ruin it for you."

","This review is really a review of the last two movies in the Matrix Trilogy.<br/><br/>WHen I first saw The Matrix I was blown away by the sheer audacity of the Wachowski Brothers, the fact that they could make dense philosophy understandable without losing its profound meaning, popular with the help of unbelievable(at the time) effects, and interesting characters(Mr. Smith being my personal favorite). I, like most, couldn't wait to continue Neo and the crew of the Nebeknezzer's journey to free humanity from the machines. Unfortunately that same philosophy and special effects became overpowering in the last two. The philosophy in the last two became so dense, cyclical, and complicated that only the Wachowski's know what the end of the trilogy means, although I have my doubts. The special effects, while fantastic, became the only drive to the movie, overpowering any 'acting' or character development. Watching many of those 'character developing scenes' was like watching a bad Sci-Fi channel movie full of corny dialogue that is meant to be profound or funny. I had very high hopes for the last two, but I emerged from the theater very disappointed and confused.

"Istrianac","Null","0","1","10 November 2004"," Only one thing wrong with this movie...
","I have seen all three films in their entirety, and I believe I have understood their theme/story-line probably better than most. So please note that throughout this review there will be SPOILERS that might ruin the experience for those who have not yet seen this masterpiece trilogy.<br/><br/>As my subject states, I could only find one thing wrong with this film (and it's trilogy), but the Wachowski brothers tried their best and that's all anyone can ask for. The Wachowski brothers essentially over-estimated the intelligence of the general audience. Period. Either that, or they new that only a small percentage of the general public would be able to grasp their concept and reasons behind the making of their film. From the choice of actors to what many viewers called ""a stupid lame story that went no where with obvious CGI."" But they stopped at nothing to get their ideas out there for the small handful of people that understood the story in it's entirety.<br/><br/>I don't have the time right now to give my full understanding/analysis of the film (it could literally fill a novel), but I will touch on a few common points where many other reviewers have commented on as being a negative of the film.<br/><br/>COMMON NEGATIVE POINT #1: ""The first Matrix film was so much better than the second two, both in story and ground-breaking effects.""<br/><br/>My understanding of the trilogy was the Wachowski's attempting to put the audience in the Matrix (so to speak). With the first film giving us (the audience) something we've never seen before and having most of the film shot in the Matrix as opposed to the real world, and in a sense ""waking those who want to be woken up."" The second film had more of an even balance between scenes shot in the Matrix and the real world and thus giving us a clearer understanding of the characters and their purpose... maybe even trying to make us think about ours. And finally the third film has more scenes shot in the real world and very little in the Matrix, drawing parallels between the attempted destruction of the Matrix. This was all achieved beautifully with the ""average"" acting abilities of Keaneu Reeves (done on purpose for believability to portray an average drone, because not everyone in that situation knows exactly what to do, say or how to act - a perfect cast for him).<br/><br/>COMMON NEGATIVE POINT #2: ""Man, in the burly brawl sequence, in Reloaded, I could totally tell the CGI when he's fightin' all those Smith's... really, really bad and noticeable.""<br/><br/>Well, duh. I mean come on, please don't tell me that I was the only one who picked up on this... Hello!?! He IS in a computer program after all and the whole idea on one person taking on 99 people in all-out fight without a single broken bone, bruise or death is soooo believable right? I thought that was a fantastic touch done on purpose for those who understood why. The first time I saw that sequence in the theatre I knew right away what they meant and that not many people would get it.<br/><br/>COMMON NEGATIVE POINT #3: ""In Revolutions, I don't get the ending. It's totally unexplained and makes no sense at all. What a stupid ending.""<br/><br/>First off... do we really need everything explained to us in laymen terms for us to be satisfied with a movie? Can't we leave nothing to our imaginations? But for those of you who want an explanation of the ending, here is my take on it:<br/><br/>Up until this point, Smith is ""no longer an agent, he's freed from the system"" (Reloaded). So is Neo. ""Smith is Neo's opposite, the result of the equation trying to balance."" (Revolutions). Their powers extend beyond the Matrix... Neo stopping the 4 sentinels, Smith copying into Bain. Smith replicates himself (like a virus) and using anyone as a host, including the Oracle, takes over their body and mind and controls it. His purpose is to replicate, regardless of weather or not he should, it's his purpose and he cannot control his purpose. The Oracle knew this and took a chance that she might be able to prevent Smith from taking full control over her when ""she's sitting there with purpose,"" even though she knew Smith was coming and could have left, but didn't (Revolutions). Now, the only way back into the Matrix to fight Smith is if the machine mainframe jacks him in... thus giving the machine mainframe a direct connection between a human and the matrix... important later on. Then the big fight sequence between Smith and Neo, where we see the result of what happens when an unstoppable object collides with an immovable object. All the while Neo is fighting the cloned Oracle, where after a fierce last blow to the face of Smith he loses some control over the embodied Oracle and she gats a final message out to Neo. Smith says: ""Everything that has a beginning, has an end Neo..."" Which is the very first time Smith had called him Neo since his interrogation of him in the first film, and there he only refers to him as ""a hacker alias - Neo"" as he's reading it from his file. Every other reference to him has been the classic: ""Mr. Anderson"" After that phrase the roles of power are reversed, Neo knows he is now ready to defeat Smith and save Zion at the cost of his own life and Smith is terrified but knows that he cannot fight the control of his purpose - to replicate. Not knowing that when he does, he now has given the machine mainframe direct access to his code by cloning Neo and all the machine mainframe has to do now is basically ""hit the delete button"" and Smith goes away leaving all the cloned bodies behind including the Oracle. The Matrix has now had a successful virus scan. The Matrix will more than likely dissipate as all those who wish to be freed can do so now as a peaceful co-existence is attempted.<br/><br/>Well, that's all for now... I could go on in greater detail on almost every aspect of the film, but for those who don't like to pass judgment on a film without a clear understanding of it. Some recommended reading material:<br/><br/>""Taking the Red Pill"" Science, Philosophy and Religion in The Matrix by Glenn Yeffeth (Editor), David Gerrold.<br/><br/>""The Matrix and Philosophy: Welcome to the Desert of the Real"" (Popular Culture and Philosophy, V. 3)"
"pip-7","10","0","1","14 October 2004"," A Crowning Achievement
","I fully understand that many critics and Matrix fans alike are disappointed by the outcome and quality of The Matrix Revolutions, the final chapter of the Matrix Trilogy. But while they just simply dismiss as a mindless, CGI action-packed thriller, what they don't know is that every weakness has a strength of its own and beyond. The Matrix Revolutions may be the weakest of the series, but it is also provides the most appealing, exhilarating, spiritual and energetic ride I've ever experienced. Also, Revolutions also has the most realistic uses of CGI ever created and the SFX guys really manage to pull this off (I always thought Revolutions would have snatched an Oscar instead of Return of the King. Due to bad press, it never came to fruition).<br/><br/>Where many see it as a failure, I see Revolutions as a worthy conclusion to the series. The main reason is that Revolutions is just a fragment of a bigger puzzle. The whole three movies connect and heavily rely on each other since each cannot qualify itself as a contender alone (The first Matrix is an exception but the Wachowski Bros. want to represent each with a theme: Birth, Life and Death, so I abide by it). The first Matrix is merely an introduction, infusing many philosophical 'techno-babbles' while witnessing the bizarre yet subtle effects of the Matrix. Reloaded is a mere extension of the first but with more surprises, balancing its weight between action sequences and mind-bending thoughts. It also serves as act two as the machines impatiently begin to dig down into the cities of Zion. Finally, Revolutions is act three: a grand finale as the Wachowski Bros. demonstrate the outcome of the first two, resulting in massacre and total destruction between the two races while all shrink into a final confrontation. All seem to blend nicely in the entire trilogy, assembled and paced in order like an orchestra. I also suggest to watch the Animatrix DVD, starting off with the two parter The Second Renaissance (you will soon learn the brilliance of the Brothers' storytelling technique).<br/><br/>Despite poor script and wooden acting (at least the actors have tried their best), it doesn't really matter. By the time you jack in, The Matrix Saga feels like a wild dream and ends with a bang as we begin to jack out, feeling satisfied with its final premise. I also hope that those who hate Revolutions will reconsider by watching the entire saga again."
"surgeonviper28","1","0","1","13 October 2004"," The ultimate fraud??
","I have just received information that the Wachowski Brothers never even wrote the original Matrix. They stole the story from a person by the name of Sophia Stewart. Yes that is right and it really explains a lot too because the final movies although directed by the brothers are so god awful. Lots of great movies have not come from the men who directed them but to hear that they jacked the credit for it to boost the resume as supposed geniuses makes this all very unsettling. Revolutions left a lot of people shocked and outraged but for good reason. It never resolved the real story of the Matrix. Those who don't like the original sit back now and hale the philosophical aspect of the final 2 movies. But the truth is this movie is a phony, it is vague because the material is far over the heads of the makers of it."
"sdfrsdfr","Null","0","1","4 October 2004"," Matrix Revolutions (***)
","The Matrix Revolutions is a movie that suffers due to a colossal miscalculation on the part of the Wachowski brothers. Neo, the messiah avatar of Zion, continues his quest to fulfill his destiny and make peace with the Machines who have conquered the world. As we recall, virtually the whole of humanity have been jacked in to a virtual world called the Matrix. The first Matrix shows us how Neo escaped this world, only to return as a potential Saviour of humanity. The Matrix Reloaded showed the extent of Neo's apotheosis, culminating in a cliff hanger ending with Neo's powers seemingly to extend to the waking world. In the finale, Neo must travel to Machine city to make peace with the Machines and take on his arch-nemesis, the rogue Agent Smith, in a final showdown to determine the fate of both man and machine.<br/><br/>In the first Matrix, there is a spectacular escape and showdown with Agent Smith in the Matrix world. In Matrix Reloaded, there is a spectacular freeway chase with multiple levels of action in perfect counterpoint with each other, a superbly choreograph frenzy of incredible special effects. The action sequences in the Matrix world is what gives the franchise it's staying power.<br/><br/>In the final episode, the Wachowskis make a dire miscalculation. They misappropriate an inordinate amount of screen time for the battle of Zion. This takes place somewhere in the middle of the film, a long, exhausting sequence that shows the metal octopi of the machine army streaming into Zion and the humans blasting them out of the sky with their machine guns. Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, Agent Smith, the Oracle, in essence all the characters that we have made a connection with throughout the preceding three hundred or so minutes of the first and second films, are nowhere to be found. Instead, we are suddenly asked to care about a bunch of second string characters in Zion  General whatsisname, the boy who he, the Zion leaders whatchamacalit. This posits a situation that is diametrically opposed to what Hitchcock does quite often, a reverse- Macguffin. What's in the briefcase? It's not important, what is important is the connection the object has for the main characters. Here the Macguffin takes a life of its own, like a lurching, CGI created mutant. The metal octopi stream, scream and shred, the Zionists grimace, shout platitudes and shoot stuff up. This goes on and on for forty five minutes. This colossal miscalculation throws the whole film out of balance, and as a result, the movie never really recovers. Not even when the movie eventually snaps back into focus as soon as we rejoin Neo's final journey to machine city. <br/><br/>I sat down to watch Revolutions again yesterday evening on DVD. I skipped the whole battle of Zion, relying only on memory for the general details of how the war went. Suddenly, the movie seemed much better. The narrative arc was taut and sure. The fight choreography at the S&M club weapons room had an electric charge. The sacrifices of the characters were felt more deeply. The fight with Bane-Smith in the Lagos felt more urgent. I began to appreciate the wonders of the machine city  a luminescent play of lights, the ghostly apparition of the machine leader made up of thousands of shifting flying machines. Everything felt improved - the excitement of the Lagos' flight into a cloud of metal octopi, the one moment of sunshine as our heroes burst through the black cloud cover shrouding the planet, the spectacular showdown between Neo and Smith. The pulpy references to a Christ figure and the new world where the Oracle and Sati sit and watch a sunrise at the conclusion gain in poignancy and resonance. When will filmmakers with a bigger budget ever realize, less is often more."

Its visual side (special effects) would have to be the best ever done, along with its brilliant music, which was perfectly done by DON DAVIS. Keanu Reeves was a stunning 'NEO' (the one) I would have to say that it would measure up to be his best film. This Matrix Revolutions was written with perfection and Directed with a Passion and with holds a message: FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN AND BELIEVE IN LOVE.

"Boba_Fett1138","7","0","1","30 July 2004"," The Matrix trilogy turned into old fashioned fighting and shooting.
","What made the previous 2 Matrix movies good and unique were the ""matrix"" fights and the use of bullet time. ""The Matrix Revolutions"" threw this all overboard and what is left is an old fashioned fighting and shooting science-fiction movie instead.<br/><br/>It's ironic, the worst scene's in ""The Matrix Reloaded"" were the Zion's scene's but in ""The Matrix Revolutions"" these are the best one's! The Zion attack is definitely spectacular but when you watch a Matrix movie you would expect fight scene's with wires and bullet time and not the fighting and shooting that has been done dozens of times before. It's also a disgrace that they heavily borrow from other science-fiction movies such as ""Aliens"" (The whole APU things and they even seem to have borrowed some of the costumes and weapons used in ""Aliens"") and the Star Wars movies (using nameless characters that only press buttons and deliver their line's cheesy. In the Star Wars movies this work but in ""The Matrix Revolutions"" it gets only annoying), instead of being original like the first two movies.<br/><br/>The end Neo vs. Smith fight is cool but it can't make up for the lack of missing fight scene's. Also the burly brawl and the subway fight against agent Smith from the previous two Matrix's movies were in my opinion better. I don't know, the whole end fight seemed like a Dragonball Z episode were two superman like characters fight each other without getting seriously injured.<br/><br/>Thank God most of the mumbo jumbo talk from ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is gone but it still have some pointless and simply weird scene's such as the whole Merovingian/Persephone scene that only felt like a lame excuse to show Monica Bellucci and her cleavage again.<br/><br/>Yet again there is absolutely no spark between Neo and Trinity which makes the whole love story yet again very unbelievable. In the first Matrix movie there was still some good acting and dialog but in the other two it is the complete opposite. Low point when it comes to acting was Clayton Watson who gave a great lesson in overacting.<br/><br/>It is far from a bad movie, it is just not what you should expect from a Matrix movie, in that way ""The Matrix Revolutions"" disappoints and also the ending is not completely satisfying. Still it is a spectacular movie with some at times impressive special effects and I have to admit that I was completely blown away by it when I first saw it in the cinema (The main reason for this was the Zion fight that was very spectacular to see and hear in the cinema. I would have rated it a 9/10 back then, which is higher as my ""The Matrix Reloaded"" rating) but once when I saw it again for the second time at home I noticed the many flaws and the unsatisfying things about the movie. This is also why I hardly ever write a movie comment for a movie that I have only seen just once or in the cinema.<br/><br/>Might seem good and spectacular the first time but it gets worser on every viewing.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","I'll admit it, I really liked ""The Matrix"". So, I made the mistake of purchasing ""Reloaded"" on DVD. After doing so, I thought that, as bad as ""Reloaded"" was, it was just a stepping stone to ""Revolutions"". So, I again spent good money with the belief that the final installment would return to the quality of the original story. What a mistake! If you didn't like the second installment of this series, you certainly won't like this conclusion.<br/><br/>Except for the special effects, and I'm not so sure just how special they were, this movie stinks. When it was over, I had no idea who was the winner, who the loser, of this waste of time movie. It seems that a computer program (Mr. Smith) gained self awareness, proceeding to wear dark glasses, and began to call his opposite, Neo (the balance, which I never understood) Mr. whatever. I had once thought that Neo was removed from his crib that the machine world used to collect our hymans electrical energy. But, apparently, Neo was more than this. He was the evil software's opposite, the balance. The concluding battle between these two forces were meant to show the moviegoer that there can be no winner when two equally opposing forces meet, just achieve ""the balance"" and you win. Whatever happened between the poor human citizens buried miles beneath the ground and the maching ""God"" that at one time controlled the world through the electrical charges of it's human collection, I'll never know. I do know that ""the oracle"" that we believed dead more tha once, sits under a blue sky on a beautiful spring like day, the machind ""God"" has made some sort of peace pack with Neo (not sure if it means that any of the enslaved humans are returned to life), Neo's girl fried gets to see the beauty of the earth and sky for 3 seconds before her exit and a small group of humans soon to become Morlocks are screaming happily at Neo's success in stopping their complete destruction. Never mind the machines that produce the environment and food supply. I know we see the Oracle on a park bench in New York but I have no understanding how the transformation from a world completely destroyed by machines provides her that wonderful moment. In fact, I don't have a clue as to the Oracles existence at the conclusion anyway, the last time I saw her, before the closing scenes, she was in the grasp of a smiling, crazily laughing Mr. Smith. About the best I can say about this movie is that it finally ended. I feel like a sap for putting money into the DVD's. If anyone, reading this, has a better understanding of the movie, please be kind enough to tell me. Or, was the enjoyment derived only from the special effects, and from the producers, from the cash they hauled in?"

","Some have said that the time gaps between issues of the Matrix series rendered dramatic developments and narrative techniques irrelevant. I say no. The 3rd and concluding chapter of the ""Matrix"" saga,at least on video lives up to its predecessors and far outstrips the technically impressive but emotionally inert second chapter. The challenge for a movie of scope is to be able to embrace the personal and the Wachowski brothers amply achieve that. Even more, the challenge of a series is to culminate, not merely conclude, and Matrix Revolutions does indeed finish and exceed the previous chapters, BUT ONLY if you watched the first two. As a movie oriented afternoon/evening of philosophical impact, emotional enlightenment and kick-ass entertainment, it was be a challenge to surpass the Matrix trilogy and in particular, this conclusion of the series."

","The Matrix Revolutions had a difficult task to carry out by finishing the so greatly started story. The now famous characters finally get to the point when everything is solved one way or another, it's the end of war and the winner is about to be announced in just few hours.<br/><br/>I had cautious expectations for this last part and to make it short: I was not disappointed. While there might have been some things in the movie I'd like to have been shown or developed a bit differently, it is a worthy ending to a worthy series. Some may perceive the story as being cheesy, I myself find it dramatic and well-structured enough for what the Matrix is - a very high production values Sci-Fi/Action movie. In case you're expecting ""The Godfather"" level of performance or drama depth, you'll obviously be let down.<br/><br/>If you're pointlessly unbiased and have the mood to watch a good Sci-Fi/Action film and have watched the previous two movies, this one should please you with the visual complexity and epic scale as well reasonably thought out story. The Matrix Revolutions is not as the original Matrix, no movie will be, but the two sequels tried hard at the only thing there was left to them: continuing the already revealed concept and story and to improve on technical side and they have succeeded. Although I missed the ""in-Matrix"" scenes more frequent in previous two movies and Merovingian (along with his glamorous Persephone) makes only a brief appearance, it's understandable since now the movie revolves around the real world, nothing can be solved in Matrix any longer, this time the blood is real and deaths do count. Acting remains on pretty much the same level - nothing awards winning, but this movie is not about acting, it's about story, and Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss still do the job. The so unfortunate death of Gloria Foster (Oracle) obviously did have an impact on the movie, but it's something that could hardly be changed.<br/><br/>I would have voted it as an 8.0 movie, but seeing so many biased (1.0 for instance) ratings, I confess I have given it a ten, it certainly deserves more than a mere 6.3. Can you think of a better movie in this genre (and no, Blade Runner, 2001, Aliens and similar all-time favourites are NOT from this genre)? I know I can't."

","I was disappointed with the original Matrix which, despite of all the hype, had hardly any originality and merely recycled ideas stolen from elsewhere. The special effects were ok of course, but then again for example the ""deep"" meaningless dialogues were almost laughable.<br/><br/>Therefore, after seeing all the bad reviews, I was quite surprised to find that The Matrix Revolutions makes a decent ending for the series. For example, the annoying meaningless pseudo-philosophical babble of Oracle and Morpheus in the two previous movies makes perfect sense after seeing the ending, if you can read between the lines. Unfortunately, most people seem to have missed the implications of the ending because they are not spelled out to the viewer (and I'm not into spoilers). There are also enough small twists in the basic storyline to keep one's interest toward the conclusion. I was also pleased to see that, despite of the opportunities, the movie was not hacked into numerous TV-like cuts likey they tend to do nowadays. The Wachowski Brothers have not sold out (completely), there is still hope."

","When The Matrix debuted back in 1999, we saw something that our eyes wouldn't believe.  A  mind blowing plot, the best special effects, and the birth of what could have been a great  franchise.<br/><br/> Yet now it is 2003.  The bullet-time special effect has been redone so much I can't even turn  on Nickelodeon without seeing it done on Fairly Odd Parents.  Lord of the Rings debuted  years ago, giving trilogy fans something to look foward too in the mean time.  Then there is  the fact that money means more than a plot, which the Matrix Trilogy completely looses too.<br/><br/> Revolutions is what the Matrix shouldnt have been.  Worse case scenerio where money and  hype mean more than a plot.  This move shows the same special effects that we have seen  for 4 years.  Some of the martial art scenes are exact duplicates from the original Matrix.  The  heros (Trinity and Neo) that we care to see the most spend a screen time of a half an hour on  the big screen throughout the whole movie, and when they do come back....its not for long.   We watch the war with Zion, that will have little effect on any viewer.  Then there is a weak  ending that makes you think "" Why did they spend all this time on 2 movies when we are  right back at the beginning?""<br/><br/> I can not express truly what a dissapointment this film is.  In my mind there is no Matrix  Trilogy.  Just like there was no spoon.  You will meet people that will tell you ""you just dont  understand"".  I thought seeing the orginal 15 times at the theater, waiting 3 hours for  Reloaded's opening, waiting an hour to get Reloaded's dvd, Pre-selling the game, and waking  up at 8 to see Revolutions was understanding enough.

This sequel was so bad, it almost made me wish for another Police Academy sequel or maybe another Highlander Sequel. I mean there are reasons to make sequels, The Empire Strikes Back, The Two Towers, Godfather Part 2. Heck, there was probably a reason they had 1000s of Agent Smiths in the movie, they probably hoped that Hugo Weavings bankabilty on LOTRs would push there movie to make tons of money. Well a good ending would have been good, not a blind hero, dead heroine and a cheesy battle scene. where are the laser beams. Even doctor evil had laser beams.

","As an avid fan of the Wachowski's work to date, I had high expectations for this closing chapter of the matrix trilogy. I was not dissapointed.<br/><br/>*Spoilers*<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions picks up exactly where Reloaded left. It continues as promised with a somewhat more lively pace. Neo and Bane (Smith's human costume) remain in coma's opposite one another on the operating tables aboard one of the ships.<br/><br/>We are told by the oracle that Neo's mind came to greif when he touched the machine source to stop the sentinals at the end of Reloaded, he is alive but is stuck in Limbo, half way between the machine world and the real world.<br/><br/>This Limbo is known as the Trainstation, and is a separate reality connected to the matrix. This station was built by a program known as the Trainman (who works for the Merovingian), it is used as a tool to bring programs into the matrix that serve no purpose that otherwise would be deleted. It is here that we meet the inquisitive little girl Sati, she is the offspring of 2 programs, Rama Kandra (seen at the restaurant in Reloaded) and his wife Kamala. At this point, we find that programs (machines) have the ability to hold human emotions, such as ""love"" and ""Karma"".<br/><br/>In an attempt to rescue Neo from the Trainstation Morpheus, Trinity and Seraph, have to fight through club Hell, to make a deal with the French Hades - Merovingian. It is Trinity's love for Neo that is notably pointed out by the frenchman's wife Persephone that makes the deal go through.<br/><br/>Neo's brief encounter with the Oracle shapes the rest of the movie, here we learn that Neo's choices were truly his own, and not shaped by fate (unlike those around him). Previous questions are answered when we re-affirm the fact that the oracle is 'The mother of the matrix', and that her role within the matrix is to unbalance the equation that is so perfectly formulated by the father of the matrix - The Architect. The oracle warns of the ever growing threat of the Program Smith, who is spreading through the matrix like a virus, and she say's to Neo ""You are all that stands in his way"".<br/><br/>Revolutions puts the pedal to the metal after Neo jacks out. Neo and Trinity take Niobe's ship to the machine City to try and strike a deal, while the rest of the crew attempt to reach Zion before it is destroyed completely. I won't spoil the end for you, however, I must say that the character Smith, really develops as the ending unfolds.<br/><br/>As many already know the matrix trilogy is heavily wound with philosophical underpinnings, however the entire trilogy is delivering a message that many people tend to miss. The message is that we must fight against the machine, we must think freely about the everyday choices we make, whether the machine be your government, your school or even the multinational company that pushes you into purchasing their product, you must have a mind of your own, because if you live your life doing what your government, school or multinational company tells you that you must do, then you are just another part of their system, their system is there to keep you under control in order to change you from a human being into a suburban slave.<br/><br/>There are many impressive action scenes in this film, and some truly beautiful artistic imagery. However, it is the sheer depth and effort that really show through, especially when you find how the story relates to many of the great religious beliefs, including biblical thought, mythological context and the mathematical reasoning used to create the Matrix system. The Wachowski brothers raised many questions within Reloaded and answered many of them in Revolutions, but this film intended to leave many of the answers out their for the interpretation of the viewer, and unfortunately there are many people and critics alike who simply cannot see past the action. Their shallowness and inability to understand the story has created a bad name for this great film. I am sure that this story is one that fans will be discussing for a long time yet, and like many other great works of art, will have different meanings for everyone who gives it some thought.<br/><br/>
If you are one of the people who didn't like this film because you couldn't really follow the storyline, or you had difficulty finding the significance in some of the biblical like dialogue, I suggest that you ask some questions on the forums, I know that there are many intelligent answers that you can find."

","Revolutions was a big dissapointment to many, but it had to be because it is a sequel. Lot of people don't see the greatness that this movie is. I realize that some of the dialogues were awkward (Commander Lock saying ""GODDAMNIT!"" everytime something happens...annoying)and the acting wasnt perfect. What seems to be the real problem was the poor marketing strategy by Warner Brothers. They made people over-anticipate the film and making us expect what we weren't going to get. As a film itself, Revolutions stand out. It isn't your average summer blockbuster film. it has soul and heart which people dont seem to see. Many dont seem to understand why certain scenes are there. They complain that it is out of context, but they all have purpose in the film and they have hidden philosophical meanings. So. i recommend that you try not to compare this film to the original Matrix because it cant. Instead, try to watch this film as an independent piece. get in a comfortable couch and try to see what this film can really offer."

","I guess we are all greedy. The studios for more money and the audience for more of the same taste of cinematic beauty.<br/><br/>Imagine the legendary status some movies could achieve, if they didn't have sequels. Wasn't 'Back to the Future' ruined by its 3rd sequel? The same goes for 'The Godfather'. Wouldn't 'Lord of the Rings' be the greatest movie of all time, if it was one movie only? And lets not forget about 'Star Wars'. Unfortunately 'The Matrix' was also ruined by its sequels.<br/><br/>Now imagine 'Pulp Fiction' with a sequel. Tarantino isn't dumb you know. And the Wachowski's should have found another outlet for their productivity, instead of ruining a movie that demonstrated the most stunning visual style since 'Pulp Fiction' - and I am not talking about the bullet-time effect.<br/><br/>Anyway trying to save their movie, they attempted to complete the trilogy in confusion. But if you watch closely, you will see that the ending is sadly simplistic. Please note that simple means clever, while simplistic means stupid.<br/><br/>The visual effects are absolutely breath taking. The only reason to watch 'Revolutions'.<br/><br/>I am not a 'Matrix' fan. I have stated many times before that it is a 'Dark City' ripoff.

","The Matrix Revolutions has got to be a great movie to end the Matrix Trilogy. Although i think this is the least best because i thought the actors and actresses made this movie a type with no much type of action (Like more fighting and the slow motion) I feel that they got on with this and made this one a quickie one because they made the last 2 Matrix movies (The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions) in the same year (2003) Matrix Reloaded was released in the uk cinemas in May 2003 and then 6 months later in November 2003 they brought out Matrix Revolutions. To make 2 movies in one years that is popular with the first in a trilogy, i would think they would crack on with it and try not to make as much mistakes. I did like The Matrix Revolutions and i thought it had a great ending to end the the Trilogy. I give the movie 10 out of 10. I would think that this last movie would have been spent on less than the other 2 previous Matrix movies because i think they wanted to do the best scenes first, like in Matrix Reloaded, the creators spend a massive 150 Million on one scene which brought the movie to an amazing one. It's a fantastic Trilogy to watch, all 3 martix movies, they are amazing to watch. Fantastic."

","""This is the end.""<br/><br/>This is your only spoiler warning...<br/><br/>The biggest struggle with franchises is figuring out what to do next. Horror franchises dehydrate when their creative wells run dry.  The Bond series solved that problem through repetition, 40 years of the same material tweaked in minor ways.  'Star Wars' loaded too many loose ends on 'Jedi' so its inexperienced director couldn't make something tangible.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Indiana Jones went from the dark and sardonic in 'Raiders' to pure pedestrian so Ford and Spielberg could fail together.  The metamorphosis from selfish warrior to holy crusader too closely followed Spielberg's own change in his film philosophy.<br/><br/>'Lord of the Rings' tried fixing its problems by referencing itself less and 'Star Wars' more.  Yet another transition: from the achievements of individuals to the actions of armies.  Another noble failure.<br/><br/>So the third installments of the 'Star Wars', 'Alien', 'Evil Dead', and 'LotR' films are at least interestingly conceived and executed in some way. This doesn't even get that credit.  Lucas had an ace in his hand for 'Jedi', the Emperor, but the Wachowskis show here that they are completely out of ideas.<br/><br/>The Wachowskis reuse the color-skewing technique of Mr. Fincher while mixing their characters with Jim Henson.  Thus a totally artificial environment, both intentional and unintentional.  They have created their own 'Matrix.' Once again, we get the emphasis on John Woo and Arnold Schwarzeneggar and the computer effects have revealed everything, showing how fake they are. 'Rings' and 'Alien' had the same trouble so once again 'Star Wars' comes out on top.  Another pillar fight, more squids, more bankrupt production design. It's all banal.<br/><br/>What I find the most interesting is how the Wachowskis try rearranging the spacial requirements of film that they invented the first time around.  This is more inventive than Michael Bay, but proves to be their undoing.  Zion is the Ewok of the project, showing no imagination.<br/><br/>I shall compare the assault on Death Star II in 'Jedi' to this because it is seeing the same event over again, but trying to put it in a new light. Lucas' first attempt was totally bland, missing every opportunity.  He got it right the second time, creating one of his two worthwhile battles (the other being Hoth).  Here we don't have that luxury as what the Wachowskis got wrong originally is flaunted.<br/><br/>Let's hope the Brothers stop making movies now before they make total fools of themselves.<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud"

","The Matrix franchise is about religious and philosophical oneliners mixed with grinding action, all set in a disturbing, dark dystopian future. This one delivers the good on an apocalyptic & explosive scale!<br/><br/>Pseudo intellectuals or nerd types move along, the roller coaster ride is gorgeously rough and fast paced and will have the best of you. If you appreciated a movie like Terminator 3, you'll greatly enjoy this one as well.<br/><br/>Action simply doesn't get any better than this. The action is insanely intense, fueled by dense, hardcore chaotic battle scenes in this breathtaking chapter of the Matrix trilogy.<br/><br/>The dialogs are brief and casual, which is what offended the pseudo intellectual types out there. Reminder here, this isn't a book by Renee Descartes or Dostoevsky, it's an action flick.<br/><br/>The events that unfold are of a miraculous nature, they have to be experienced to be understood, they are beyond words or explanations. Nobody in the movie ever gives a lengthy speech or enlighten you as to their true meaning. You have to come up with those answers yourself, which is what annoyed the critics of this movie.<br/><br/>The plot is simple to grasp without having Morpheus making a speech either during half the movie, as was covered previously in the first chapter, for those who missed it. The initial 40 mns of this movie unfold slowly and quietly, which is the only possible downside to this otherwise extraordinaire epic undertaking.<br/><br/>This is a truly hardcore, sanguine, explosive, overwhelmingly brilliant conclusion to this great trilogy.

","Someone has to say it.  Not just anyone, but a Matrix fanatic. (deep breathe).This movie sucked. (lol)  I thought it would rival L.O.T.R.  That trilogy got better with every film.  The matrix trilogy got worst.  The original Matrix had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  When trinity jumped across the street I almost .(clearing throat) myself.  When I saw that I was like, `oh yeah' , I knew right then I was going to love this film.  And I was right.  I truly believed and still believe no action film will ever top the original Matrix. NEVER!!<br/><br/>I remember walking out of the theater of the original Matrix thinking ` O.M.G.  That was un-freakin-believable!' ( I became a matrix fanatic) Movie Theater visits - 5 times.   I'm talking if I heard any negative comments I would defend this movie to the death.  Then came Matrix Reloaded -  my confidence in the Wachowski brothers was just a little shaken, but I still walked out thinking `O.M.G. That was un-freakin-believable! A little cartoonish. but still a great movie') - Movie Theater visits - 3 times. Then came the infamous Matrix Revolutions. (sigh)  Where do I begin.  How about Movie Theater visits - 1 time- and I almost asked for my money back. Enough said?  I'll give them credit for the battle scenes but the script did nothing for me.  I mean lets get real people exactly how long will this so-called peace between the humans and machines last?  You actually think the machines are going to let humans build their societies back up and out-number them.  I would give this peace treaty about a week, max! Before they try to exterminate the humans again.  This movie created more questions than it answered.  I just knew Revolutions would finally silence the critics.  But when I walked out of the theater, all I could do was look at the ground and try not to make eye contact.  So that no one would see the shame in my eyes.  The 1st and 2nd installment you could always tell when the movie was over.  The movie-goers would be talking as loud as they could while exiting the building and in the parking lot, praising the Wachowski brothers and the movie.  After Revolutions ended it look more like a death march as the people quietly and I repeat quietly walked out to their cars. Most were probably like me. `What the hell was that?!'<br/><br/>Don't get my wrong.  I will still defend the The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded but I can't with good conscience defend Revolutions.  And I know we are going to have those guys who will say that we aren't deep and we're not intelligent enough to see the meaning behind Revolutions.  But I will put them in the same class as the art society.  You know the type.  They go to an art museum and see deep meaning in a blank picture.  Yeah those types.

","WARNING!  SPOILERS !<br/><br/>I couldn't be more disappointed in a finale than this.  As a programmer by trade, the most amazing aspect of The Matrix was the plausability of the concept.  The development of the plot in Reloaded to have programs that executed free will (Merovingian, Persephone, the Oracle) and the Architect's use of systems and procedures to handle anomalies (i.e. the arrival of the One) was brilliantly chilling.<br/><br/>Then to deliver this bomb to ""put a wrap"" on the trilogy - the W's really phoned it in with Revolutions (pun intended).  They delivered their 3rd movie as contractually obligated.  This movie was completely uninspiring and passionless.  The storyline was fractured, and totally abandoned any character development from Reloaded.  Any real fan of this trilogy could have developed a better finale than this.<br/><br/>If I interpreted the ending correctly, Agent Smith became the virus in the Matrix that he claimed humans were on earth, and Neo was the Norton Anti-Virus detection that took him out.<br/><br/>Then we see Smith go down, and Neo assume a crucifix-like posture after he's unhooked.  Our savior.<br/><br/>The Oracle and the Architect apparently agree to allow those who want to get out of the Matrix to leave.  Perhaps they realize that given the choice, most of humanity will choose to remain ""online"" than live in a post-apocalyptic earth underground.<br/><br/>How nice and neat.<br/><br/>My son and I viewed Reloaded many times on DVD and discussed alternatives for where Revolutions could go.  We both thought that Neo was still in the Matrix (because of his powers over the machines when he was ""out"" of the Matrix).  We also thought that when the Architect was referring to the ""Mother"" of the Matrix, he may have been referring to Trinity or Persephone rather than the Oracle.<br/><br/>Alas, perhaps the W's just ran out of interest and just wanted their cash."

I think what these folks have missed is that these films from the begining have been telling a story from a different perspective than traditional films.<br/><br/>Revolutions ties together all the loose ends of a story that is not about one character or one sequence of events, but rather is about the SUM TOTAL of all of these.  The whole theme is the interrelation of all beings bringing about change and development in life.  So you may not get to feel a deep emotional connection with Mifune, or the Kid, or even the relegated Morpheus, but you do see what it is that they do and why it is important in the grand scheme of things.  Again, it is a story about life itself and the roles that individuals play, not about any one individual themselves.<br/><br/>People thought they were going to get a story about good overcoming evil, but the beauty of the sequels (set up by the original) is that they show the concept of ""good vs. evil"" to be an illusion, just like the Matrix itself, and one that must be dispelled in order for life to advance.  All the questions raised in Reloaded (whether you heard the questions or not) are answered with Revolutions as we see the grand design completed.<br/><br/>So if all you were ever intrested in was cool special effects, get the DVD and skip to your favorite parts.  If you want to witness a story which offers an intricate perspective on life and purpose, then watch the films as the myth that they are.  Revolutions reveals the creativity, intricacy, and subtlety by which the various interwoven themes are explored, and presents the capstone of the complex structure whose foundation was set in 1999. If what you were interested in after seeing the original Matrix was a story of the good guys overcoming the bad guys... then you may well be disappointed. Because this story is MORE than that, and in my opinion infinately more entertaining as a result."

","The Matrix Revolutions fulfilled all my expectations as a non-conclusion to this brilliant postmodernist trilogy.

I don't think so; It's interesting to see how blind people can really be, when they follow the lead of the masses (blind keeps leading the blind), they shouldn't make comments about a movie they don't even understand, cos if they did, they would realize how integral this movie is, bringing back the classic myths, moral lessons, universal-religion teachings, ethics, philosophy, and creating a fusion of all these backgrounds around the eternal quest of the human being, and presenting it with a new package to make it digestible for the modern world; and that's the magic of the movie, how the Wachowsky brothers managed to compile the essence of the ancient civilizations and found new ways to pass on the same old messages taught in parables by the great masters of humanity; THE MATRIX IS HERE TO STAY,  Long live the classics, and my admiration and respect to the Wachowsky brothers for this priceless gift to the world;<br/><br/>My advise to all the clever and intelligent people out there: Get the Matrix collection, it's a classic already and a must-have in everybody's movie collection;<br/><br/>To finish my review, just a little peace of advise to the masses: if you are expecting a movie with all the cliches and typical hollywood endings (""...and they lived happily ever after"") dont watch this movie, you won't enjoy it and you'll probably end up with nothing better to do than follow other's steps and start criticizing a Masterpiece, just something to think about...<br/><br/>The best saga in recent history"

","Matrix Revolutions ends right where Reloaded left off. As sentinels race to the Zion, the human city, Smith has made the matrix his own. Neo is trapped in limbo ie the train station. While here he encounters a man he caught a glimpse of in Reloaded. This program leads Neo to the first of many revelations that he will have. Revolutions is a war picture/love story/philosophical poem. The CG in the siege of zion is spectacular as is the scene. The final showdown between smith and Neo is superb but the main theme of Revolutions is not the action but the emotion. Revolutions represents the brick wall that everyone faces and hits. After years of fighting machines in a neverending cycle of violence a true end is near. The humans are rapidly finding out that not all machines are bad guys. And that in fact some have been instrumental to the existence of Zion. The tenet of human good machine bad is being proven for what it really is...stupidity. That is not to say that the action is subpar. The sentinels finally get to show just how bad they really are and the subsequent scenes of them moving in formation like a school of fish is one of coolest sites in movie history. The Matrix Revolutions doesn't cop out. The ending is sad, happy, sweet, sour, conclusive and open to interpretation all at once. It is an ending to be proud of."

","I was a fan of the Matrix series right from the beginning. I absolutely loved all three films. However, I do agree that the Wachowskis made a mistake with the second two films. It came when they tried to incorporate more philosophy into the series, overestimating the intelligence of their audience. The sequels were widely disliked by fans of movies like Mission Impossible 2, who's only purpose in film-going is to see cheap stunts repeated ad nauseam. Whereas those who enjoy well-plotted, geniously-crafted movies like ""Memento"" walked away with more satisfaction than Chris Farley leaving a pastry shop.<br/><br/>The Wachowski brothers are the Aristotles and the Joe Campbells of our generation, not mere action directors. Don't get me wrong, I love the action scenes in these movies, but they aren't what kept me coming back for each new installment. What I loved about the series was the way its story developed, its genius plot twists, it's incredible acting (especially Hugo Weaving, that guy rules), and, perhaps most of all, it's thought-provoking, philosophical dialogue.<br/><br/>Trust me, every minute of this film (along with Reloaded) is sheer genius. If you are ready for a movie that introduces a new approach to filmmaking, to see something that hasn't been done 1,000 times before, this is the movie for you. If you liked the first matrix solely for the action scenes, stick to ""Charlie's Angels.""<br/><br/>OVERALL: 10/10"
"pivn2002","1","0","1","8 December 2003"," AVOID!
","***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Yes, spoilers in this review, but that might save some the ordeal of seeing this terrible film.<br/><br/>The first and second parts of the Matrix trilogy were OK, enjoyable and stylish sci-fi films with brilliantly filmed fight sequences. Though in the second film they were beginning to get a bit tedious. The idea was an interesting one, with Neo being elightened by Morpheus he had to re-evaluate what his concept of reality was. In the second film the Matrix world was expanded and the story focused around the free-will verses determinism debate within the Matrix framework. With an ending that left the audience wondering and me excitedly awaiting the final installment I expected much from the final chapter.<br/><br/>Matrix Revolutions is simply dire. I thought nothing could be as bad as Braddock: Missing In Action III, but at least that was redeemed by unintentional humour and laughably offensive simplistic politics. Matrix Revolutions is a staggering expensive failure as a film. We are told Zion has hours before the machines find and destroy it so Neo goes on a quest to the Matrix centre. The film proceeds with no tension and while the invasion of Zion looks good, it just isn't interesting because as a spectator I was more concerned with what Neo was going to do.<br/><br/>Trinity's last words before her death was perhaps the longest speech of its kind in film, I just wanted her to hurry up and die so the film could continue.<br/><br/>By the end of the film I had lost all empathy with the characters and had to endure yet another tedious fight between Agent Smith and Neo. Yawn! As expected it went on for ages. Pointless really because Neo was always going to win in the end.<br/><br/>And then the story was revealed: The Oracle created Agent Smith, who became too powerful. Smith would be forced into a final showdown with Neo, the only person who could stop him. The Matrix would have to bargain with Neo to ensure its survival - the result a truce between mankind and machine. By that point I barely cared.<br/><br/>The Wachowski brothers could have just made one film and concluded their first Matrix film rather than a decent second film and a terrible conclusion.<br/><br/>1/10 because there was not a single moment when I was watching this film that I was enjoying the spectacle."
"stuart_hza","Null","0","1","7 December 2003"," Burn Em Alive
","!!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!!<br/><br/>Well, at least now we all know why the Wachowskis' chose to have a no publicity clause written into their contracts. Probably because they knew that the public stoning they would've received for dishing up this mangled rubbish would have been brutal - and more than well deserved.<br/><br/>But there are bigger issues at hand than the public executions I plan on holding. In the first film, riddles and cryptic clues were left sprinkled about the movie for us to find.  The dialogue was clever and, as in most good movies, made us think. References to Baudrillard and other post modern thinking were not rammed down our throats (and, in fact there is a reference to Baudrillard removed from the shooting script of the this film), they were tucked away in remote corners of the movie, like a puzzle for us to solve. There were biblical references, eastern philosophy and so much other wonderful thinking - but out of all that, came an uncluttered, well thought out and brilliantly realised piece of work.<br/><br/>Then the second film came crashing onto the scene.The budget was bigger and with it, the scenes became more elaborate. The movie, for the most part, ended up being pretty linear, until the end - when the Architect cast doubt on everything we had come to believe as true. The dialogue was, in itself fairly convoluted, and the Brothers chose to talk us through many of the central themes explored in the film - but there were themes. And we were thinking.<br/><br/>I went to see the concluding chapter of this trilogy last night. Neo was in Mobil Ave, in limbo. Come on. 'Neo' was a clever play on words, but that? Everything to do with the Frenchman, the Twins, Persephone and the club scene - aside from both the Keymaker and Neo being held captive by the Mere-however-you-spell-his-name added nothing whatsoever to the overall story. But, like everything, the story becomes repetitive: Another anagram, another Smith, another bullet time scene, another Frenchman captivity scene, another dance scene, another... another... another...<br/><br/>But you see, we're stupid. That's why we need to have the cross of light emblazoned across Neo's chest - just in case we don't get the point. Where the dialogue - although more often than not badly executed - was clever and intelligent in both the first two movies, here it just became plain weak. ""I never finished my training"" - ""Neither did I"", ""I did that for Neo"", "" What's it going to be Merv?"" and so on and so on and so on. On it goes.<br/><br/>My brother and I had discussed possible endings for the Matrix trilogy a long, long time ago, before  the release of Reloaded, and one of the most  appealing had been a crucifixion type scene. But like this? Surely the Wachowski Brothers couldn't have used Agent Smith as an easy out in ending the film. It felt like the reason the Brothers had built the Agent up over the last two movies was to give them an out. And that felt more like cheating than anything else. I suppose it could be construed as deep and meaningful that one side story (Merv , we'll call him) dropped away, while another (Agent Smith) became so crucial to the outcome of the film. I don't buy that though. It just doesn't sit well.<br/><br/>There is some wonderfully rendered imagery throughout the film. And we are lucky to have it. But there is some God-awful writing and pointless scenes too. We'll ignore the wooden, plank-like acting for the time being. That's Keanu. Pied Piper Keanu. Because in this film he led a whole host of other actors and actresses down the more often traveled path of  bad acting. The icing on the cake being Carrey Anne Moss' dying speech. Her long, long, oh so long dying speech. I know I couldn't have done any better. But then I'm not paid to.<br/><br/>I think we could be kind enough to strap the two brothers into those Zion war machine outfit things before we start the execution. After all, they offer no protection whatsoever. That's like building a tank with a Fiberglas body. A species stupid enough to build something that fragile to fight a sentinel army in deserves to get wiped out. Plug me back in - I want my steak.<br/><br/>When I left the cinema I wasn't thinking. And that was a bad sign. I'm not sure if the Brothers Grim were either.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's just a movie. A movie I didn't really like. Why? Because I chose not to."

Besides the basic story line that Neo fighting for the future of Zion that are exciting and entertaining, many words and philosophies are also interesting. Such as Smith's theory of being the empty self and meaningless life, it reminds me the idea of post-structurism of being de-center. Moreover, the importance of having the ""change"" somehow shows the bright side of humanity. To hold the hope even at the hopeless situation does encourage people who are living in the modern empty society. That's why Smith eventually being defeated.

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This is nothing but a boring war movie. Which is fine if you like mindless action flicks but the original Matrix had a fascinating plot to go along with the action scenes, which were amazing in themselves. Reloaded was somewhat interesting in how it redefined what the matrix really was, but I really can't say there was anything good about this movie. As for the ending, maybe it makes sense, probably it doesn't, but essentially I don't care enough to figure out what it means. (spoiler ahead) And as for the machines and humans coming to a truce, that's just dumb. Weren't the machines harvesting the humans for power? So why would they give that up just because Neo defeated Smith? The architect at the end seems to imply that reneging on a deal is a human trait. Personally I think that emotionless machines would be much more inclined to do that, especially since they obviously could have utterly destroyed Zion. So, to rate the three movies:<br/><br/>Matrix: 10/10<br/><br/>Reloaded: 3/10<br/><br/>Revolutions: 0/10"
"LLWC","1","0","1","14 November 2003"," Hollywood corrupts writers.
","Trite, unimaginative, and nakedly revealing, the third installment of the sudden trilogy produces a feeling akin to Dorothy's horror when she finds the ""man behind the curtain.""  Gone are the remnants of mystery and ingenuity from the original, replaced by what mindless, insipid people like to call ""mindless, insipid drivel.""<br/><br/>I'll refrain from attacking the dialogue directly, and the bare bones of the plot could have contained interesting material, but no expense was spared on repetitive action sequences.  Granted, Reloaded sported an equal number of over-exaggerated combat scenes coupled with plenty of artful computer imagery, but we saw all of this in Number One.  Revolutions hopefully concluded this stagnation (meaning: no, please, no, do not make another movie).<br/><br/>By all means, if you were unfortunate enough to watch the middle child, take a chance to see Revolutions to at least find some form of conclusion. However, go in expecting nothing, and maybe you will be pleasantly surprised.  More than likely you'll come out of the theatre with your shoulder muscles tight from stress; with each new action scene, you'll beg for some drama, but when the actors start talking, you're going to have internal hemorrhaging.<br/><br/>But, by all means, if you want a rehash of every repeated Hollywood line, if you want to endure interminable scenes of kung fu-esque sign language, if you want to return and give the movie a 1 on IMDb followed by a disparaging review, please, go see the movie.  And, if Revolutions needed a way to encourage you into the theatre, they'd beg you to do the same thing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there have been plenty of other Revolutions that accomplished a great deal more than the Matrix has."

"wessel-1","1","0","1","14 November 2003"," Crashed after the first part of the trilogy
","Should anyone want to see Matrix Revolutions, the quality of the movie depends to 99% on the composition of the audience. The movie is bad (bad as in what one critic coined as: ""Highlander 2 bad""), but don't let that stop you having fun. Cynical commentaries (""Boooooring""), imitations of other movies (""Use the force, Luke"", Darth Vader Breathing Sounds during Trinitys dead), or just a loud moaning or choking give the movie an unintended humor (you probably don't laugh about it now, but wait after you've seen the first 20 minutes and the movie has eroded your brain enough and you will be ROTFL).<br/><br/>In other respects the movies does the same thing as the machines - digging deeper and deeper, the only difference is, that the machines eventually stop while the movie continues to dig on and on. The few longer dialogs seemed to be randomly pasted together in the hope that hardcore fans will find their logic anyway (""*You just didn't understand the movie!*""). The action sequences lost their appeal in Matrix 2, a few pretty good ones would be better placed in a Terminator 4 or a Battletech movie (at least in Battletech the developers have brains enough to give their robots an armor). The quality of the movie, the appeals to blind faith and some exaggerated typical-American- patriotic sequences could make one think that the PR Devision of the White House had meddled with it (if the prototype of an average American is soooo ""patriotic"" that he wants to fight with 16 years, then is one of the last ones standing during the main battle, opens an important door and brings the news of peace to a cheering crowd - baaaah! - this all sounds like a commercial for the US Army (a very bad one too) - I feel filthy after being targeted by such a spot, ... well, perhaps such pseudo-patriotic inlays are necessary at the moment, ... thank you ""George"" ...)<br/><br/>The one good percent: I liked the two infantry women ... it had some appeal attacking a gigantic machine with just a double rocket thrower and no means of defense during a raging battle ... I must say I was impressed (much more impressed than by the behavior of the robot pilots or the ammunition reloaders), although I'd like to see these sequences in a Terminator 4 or Battletech.<br/><br/>All things considered a Highlander-Strategy should be used with the matrix movies (""If it had only been one ..."") - the first one is to be remembered as excellent, the other two should be deleted from memory - from every memory. It's a shame that the whole thing crashed after the first movie."

"billt29","10","0","1","13 November 2003"," Matrix Trilogy explained
","This review was copied from a user on yahoo movies. It definitely aided in my understanding of the entire trilogy, so i thought that it should be shared here as well.<br/><br/>""Let me first say I PROMISE YOU WILL LOVE THIS TRILOGY IF U READ THIS.<br/><br/>I apologize if my email does not follow the rules of this forum, but I felt I could offer you a very clear explanation of the Matrix series in light of reading your reviews of the Matrix Revolutions. The bottom line is people don't understand it. So this is a crash course for anyone who wants answers. Real one's, not some fanboys idea of what it's about. Please note, SPOILERS ARE ALL THROUGH THIS REVIEW.<br/><br/>Here we go with the basics.<br/><br/>Zion is real! The Matrix is not.<br/><br/>The Matrix was designed to provide a mental stimulus for the human bodies connected to the machines as a source of power. This is the sixth version of the Matrix. There have been multiple versions of the Matrix because of a flaw in the program (kinda of like Windows). That flaw is giving individuals the ability to choose.<br/><br/>The first Matrix was designed as a perfect utopia (see pt. I - Smith explains it to Morpheus; pt. II - The Architect explains it again to Neo) but humans did not accept it as real so they just kept waking up. It was redesigned to reflect our civilization at it's last stage before it was taken over by the machines (the year 1999).<br/><br/>The Architect's problem with this new design (the anomaly)of the Matrix is that it require individuals to think freely, i.e. choice. It was the Oracle that suggested he redesign the Matrix in this way. But since humans have choices, so must the programs sent to watch over them, i.e. The Agents, thus bringing us the problem that is Mr. Smith. In Reloaded, The Architect continues to speak of the anomaly he is unable to get rid of, which is why at some point, he feels the only solution is to destroy the Matrix and those who are aware of it (the people of Zion) and start from scratch again.<br/><br/>
The Oracle says it clearly in Revolutions. Mr. Smith is the result of the anomoly trying to balance itself. Mr. Smith began to think freely (see part I where he is freaking out while interrogating Morpheous) and the result was a negative one. Realize this, he is a similar program to the One so he is far more dangerous than a normal individual who makes bad decisions. Mr. Smith's virus like behavior happened in EVERY VERSION OF THE MATRIX. The result would always lead to the same thing -- a system crash if they didn't quickly reboot the system. The same knee jerk reaction you have when you realize someone has sent you a virus.<br/><br/>The One program was created to solve this problem. But each version of the One ultimately failed. Neo is different, in Reloaded he chooses the door that led to Trinity, not the door that RESETS the program. Note: The Architect even noticed that Neo's experience in the Matrix was different than all the rest, realizing he was the first of them to fall in love.<br/><br/>Onto Revolutions:<br/><br/>Neo's choice has changed everything. The system is still threatened by Smith's behavior, so the Oracle makes a new choice; one she has never done before because no version of the One has ever chosen the difficult path as opposed to easy one of just resetting the system. She allows herself to become merged with Smith in the HOPE that she'll be able to help Neo when the time is right.<br/><br/>Neo makes another unique choice. He goes to the machines and asks for PEACE as opposed to simply destroying the system by going through the opposite door as all other versions of the One did. It was a simple as that to save Zion. Machines don't need very long to process that this may be a better idea than just constantly resetting the system.<br/><br/>At the end, Smith says to Neo the movies tagline - ""Everything that has a beginning has an end,"" as the Oracle is speaking to Neo through Smith. Neo realizes it all along, the only way to end this is to sacrifice himself. The Oracle noted that Neo and the Source (the computer mainframe, the Architect they're all one and the same so don't get confused) are connected which is why he can control machines outside the Matrix. He uses this connection to his advantage. He becomes a Mr. Smith and since all the Smith's are connected, the Source now has a lock on Smith and simply deletes him. Pretty simple huh?<br/><br/>For those that like to dig deeper, than note the biblical references throughout the series. Heck, the French Man (Merovingian) is the Devil, just read the elevator button Morpheous presses when he goes to see him for the second time. The Architect represents God - i.e. the creator of the world and its destroyer whenever things don't go as he wants. He even has you to chose a select group of people to restart Zion again sort of like Noah's Ark. Neo is Jesus, the one who realizes that peace and love is the answer, not war. And the Oracle represents the Holy Spirit - the consciousness that resides in all of us. It's a deep trilogy if you PAY ATTENTION.""  It's kind of similar to another famous trilogy......Star Wars!!!!!!"
"Alanna_T","1","0","1","13 November 2003"," Where the hell can I get the blue pill?
","I think this sentiment of mine is obviously shared by several users here and has also been expressed in these oh-so-apt words - and not without a cause! Way back in those good old days in 1999, the Wachowski Brothers were still a up-and-coming team of writers/directors, and the first ""Matrix"" movie seemed like a promise of things to come. But, alas, it was not meant to be. ""Matrix: Revolutions"" is a disgraceful ending to the whole series and probably one of the worst films I have ever seen (including ""Signs"", ""Black Hawk Down"" and a lot of romantic comedies with Meg Ryan) - it is so unbelievably bad that I do not even know where to begin complaining.<br/><br/>Neither can I decide what was worst: The trite and hackneyed dialogue, randomly interspersed with pseudophilosophical ramblings ? The stereotyped characters? The looooong battle for Zion that felt hollow, empty and devoid of any meaning, because I was unable to care for any of the cliched defenders? Or the open ending that might hint at yet another sequel? Well, I don't want to imply that the first part of the series was a flawless, intelligent arthouse masterpiece - but it did have style, a certain kind of freshness and vigour. As a smart mixture of cyberpunk a la William Gibson's ""Neuromancer"" and ""Johnny Mnemonic"" (which was also adapted for the big screen starring Keanu Reeves) and Hongkong action movie a la John Woo (""Hardboiled"" and ""The Killer"" are real classics, guys), its fame might prove to be of duration.<br/><br/>""Revolutions"", however, should simply be forgotten and disappear in the depths of some archive."

Were they commendated or court marshalled? Why did u have to change the appearance of the Oracle? Was there much point? What happened to the skinny kid that followed Neo around? Is he dead?

","As bad as Reloaded was in comparison to the original Matrix, many (including myself) gave the Brothers Wachowski the benefit of the doubt that part three would bring everything together and cleverly resolve things. Instead, we got this disaster. As a local reviewer aptly put it, ""how did something that began so cool (in the original) wind up so dorky?""<br/><br/>For starters, many subplots left dangling in the second MATRIX are totally ignored in part three. What happened to the pair of albino rastafarians so prominent (and of seemingly uncertain alliance) in RELOADED? They don't have a second in part three. What the hell happened to the Emperor-like Anthony Zerbe from part two, who also had tons of screen time and was clearly positioned as a key influence on events (and a potential Judas to Zion)? Where the hell did the comely girlfriend of the Frenchman go? They stuffed her into a ridiculously cleavage-enhancing little number in part three, but whatever became of her vampiric soul kiss with Neo from part two? Nothing. Many setups for characters including the Keymaster and the Architect also saw no fruition in part three, particularly disappointing in light of the five minute soliloquy from The Architect in II which professed to open doorways to Neo (and us). In III The Architect appears for a total of four minutes on screen and only at the very end, to typically ambiguous effect.<br/><br/>Worse than these plot point 101 errors and omissions, there is no emotion or connection to the characters anymore. Neo comes closest to feeling human, but Reeves' cold reading is off-putting. Trinity is particularly ineffective; by the time an impaled Carrie Anne Moss lies down to die, the audience I sat with was essentially admonishing her to hurry up and get on with it. Morpheus, the mentor and father figure of the first movie, is reduced to window dressing in this release, playing a glorified assistant to the grating and annoying Jada Pinkett Smith.<br/><br/>The special effects take over even more than they did in the loud second installment, which makes for a second hour of sumptuous imagery but a first hour so deadly, I wish Agent Smith would have taken me before the plot less FX-fest ensued. <br/><br/>One saving grace is Hugo Weaving, whose entertaining and committed performance as Agt. Smith momentarily harks back to the first movie. Overall, however, this lone bright spot is overshadowed by a wretched script rife with overwrought dialogue, unmotivated (or flat-out wrong) characterization and more questions than answers. The special effects are eye popping but they can't save this surprisingly weak finale. 5 / 10."

The Matrix sequels do not excede its predecessor but how can you watch these movies and say they suck. Reloaded was fun and complicated, the movie was alot less darker than than Revolutoins because the characters still had hope of surviving. Reloaded had a great story and had quite a bit of philosophical references and biblical. Revolutions took the biblical references and turned it up by turning Neo into Christ. At the end Neo saves the humans and the machines by sacrificing himself. The same thing Christ did saving the Jews and the Gentiles. To wrap this up Revolutions and Reloaded are awesome.

This time, its just the fight to the last man for the city of Zion. Every man is fighting for freedom. It is a war waged on many fronts. Zion, Neo, the Matrix, Trinity, Morpheus, Niobe, they are all fighting in one way or another. It is indeed a dark time. As they say, everything that has a beginning has an end, I might say, everything that needed to be said, has been said. This is just one roller coaster ride to end it all. Some might say that instead of going out with a bang, Matrix ended with a thud.<br/><br/>I say that looking at Matrix Revolutions in its on light, it fared pretty well. The purpose of the third installment just seeks to put an end to the story (although I wonder how long it will be laid to rest, the next Matrix movie may not be written by the Wachowski bros? Maybe Neil Gaiman?). Given the development of the story, it seems the only logical conclusion."

","SPOILERS (kinda, sorta...)<br/><br/>When the Wachowskis came up with the script for their Matrix masterpiece, it was always envisioned as a Trilogy.  With the incredible (and unbelievably unfounded) backlash of both the sequels of this trilogy and the Star Wars prequels, the question begs to be asked;  why do fans wanting more of a good thing complain when a story made original before becomes ""redundant"" or ""repetitive"" the second (and in this case, third) time around???<br/><br/>The Matrix Revolutions is more than just the end of The Matrix trilogy, it's a film that creates a mood unparallelled by any other movie in recent memory. Like Laurence Fishburne has stated, the first movie was about birth, Reloaded was about life, and Revolutions is about Death.<br/><br/>A dark mood it is, and I loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>That being said, the ending to this movie, if you're anal enough not to like happy endings, will leave you feeling jaded...  no, not all questions are answered, but would you really expect them to be??  ""Why are they there? What is their purpose?  Is Neo God, or something??  I mean...  WTF???"" The movie ends, and even I was left thinking ""is this IT??""<br/><br/>I thought that in a good way, of course...  which is odd.<br/><br/>Indeed, I was left pondering many things about the plot.  The questions are left unanswered, and dodged in a way.  But such is life, of course.  The Wachowskis are good, but not good enough to solve life's riddles.<br/><br/>Other than the movie's overly criticized plot""holes"", the action is un-freaking-believable, as per usual.  Since the first movie was so original and ground-breaking in visual effects, coming up with new ideas for visual effects shots must have been difficult.  But there are moments when you stare at the screen and say (pardon the pun) ""whoa"". The battle to save Zion is fast-paced and much more interesting than I thought it would be, and the fight scenes are exciting as well.<br/><br/>To hear people say that Revolutions is a disappointment leaves me wondering one thing....  if people think THIS is crap, then I can't wait until these GENIUSES come up with something more interesing and original than this movie.  :)"

","Alright, hear me out.  Revolutions was great.  That's right, you heard me. But here's what I think I missed:  Did all of you not see the first movie or did you forget that it was also pretentious, cliched to all hell, and completely derivative of other films?  Watch it again and forget for a second that you are stupid and realize that yes, the concept is fun, the plot is silly, the acting is bad, and the action is great.  That sound familiar?  Sounds just like Revolutions to me.  I love the first Matrix like I love any good kung-fu movie and I really liked the last forty minutes of Reloaded (just so you know where I stand).  And I have to say, Revolutions was a great way to end it.  I really don't feel like reviewing Revolutions in any specific way, I just felt like pointing out that, despite popular opinion, the first Matrix (which is, of course, better than Revolutions, don't get me wrong) isn't perfect or overly original, but still very good. I feel the same way about Revolutions and I was quite shocked to see all the overwhelmingly negative reviews, particularly considering the slack Reloaded was given.  To sum up... a lot better than Reloaded and almost as good as The Matrix.  Very operatic and anime influenced (see X, Metropolis, or Akira (sort of)).  Very big, no copping out, a lot of fun."

Too many of us now expect a clearly apparent plot, accompanied by quick, calculated action, followed up by a nice clean ending. In other words, Short Attention Span Theater. Perhaps that explains why some reviewers here deadpanned Revolutions but raved about Freddy vs. Jason, The Rundown and 2 Fast 2 Furious. The Matrix series was designed for those viewers that are actually able to consider alternatives to reality and the endless possibilities those alternatives can produce. Its not simple mindless action. <br/><br/>The other misconception was that the Matrix movies were action movies. They are purely sci/fi movies that feature some jazzy action segments. For most people that ""got"" the movie the action scenes were simply icing on the cake - not the cake itself. The important part of the movies is the concept behind the action.

","Oh, I just came back from a screening of this and all my worst fears came to light. Yes, this film sucks. Horribly and without mercy. Now, I really liked the Matrix, defended the decent Reloaded, but I'm all out of praise for this series. I just went off on my friends about how much this movie sucks, so I probably won't have much left new to say.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this film, I really did. I was going to cut it all the slack that I cut Reloaded. Even then....ugh.<br/><br/>This film is bad. Bad bad bad. The Zion parts are like every other post-apocalyptic sci-fi movie ever made. There is almost no time spent in the Matrix. Heck, there is almost no time spent with our main characters. I think Morpheus disappears halfway through and no one notices. The Merovigian and his goons are hardly in the film, and seem rushed through. The dialogue is bad. The fight for Zion is headache inducing. Here's a plot hole for you Matrix geeks -- in the Animatrix, we learn that some ships have kidnapped Squidiees for study. So, why can't they just use that information to create an EMP that affects only the Squidiee's and not the Zion ships?<br/><br/>Holes like that ruin the movie.

"Gigi_tommasi","1","0","1","10 November 2003"," Why the rabbit-hole ends here *MAJOR SPOILERS*
","In my comments for Reloaded, I criticised the film heavily as a stand alone work, but refrained from casting final judgement, as I would never walk out of a film half way through, particularly one so (as we have been told) profound as The Matrix. It's comparable to turning a song off before the chorus and then whining about how it wasn't memorable enough. There was no way of telling exactly where the story was leading to at the end of Reloaded, and too many threads had been dangled in front of the audience for us to properly judge its merits. However, as I said at the time, the action scenes were overlong, dull and artificial thanks to some inelegant use of CGI (which is something of a curse these days); dialogue and acting were both borderline woeful on the whole; and the philosophical pretentiousness wasn't half as clever as it thought it was. However, I was willing to give Revolutions a fair crack - in fact, I was fairly excited to see how accurate the theories I had of the continuation of the story were, and where the significance in apparently superfluous scenes from Reloaded would be found.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Revolutions is possibly the worst film I have ever seen at the cinema. It is so bad, in fact, that it completely degrades both Reloaded and the original. Of all the theories of where the plot may go I had read, or come up with myself, the Wachowski's answers were so incoherent and downright unintelligent that none had even suggested themselves as possible solutions. So, Neo seems to have powers in the real world? Surely, we must be dealing with a secondary matrix, another form of control, because Reloaded continually rammed this notion down our throats, and it must be significant? Well, actually, no. The Wachowski's explanation consists literally of the Oracle telling Neo that his powers extend to the real world, and that's it. This is shameful laziness for a film of (supposedly) such profound scope. As for the rest, the plot is full of holes that, bizarrely enough, make it more difficult to comprehend exactly what is going on (coming out of the cinema, I had to explain to a friend what had happened, but only because the plot is so incoherent he assumed there was something deeper he had missed). Do not be fooled. There is no significant deeper meaning to this movie, besides the embarrassingly blatant Christian symbolism, which I can't imagine anyone failing to get a handle on. The common defence of this film by users here is that anyone who didn't like it didn't understand it. Well, I've done university level philosophy on both mind and body and religious philosophy, and the only thing to understand is that this movie is a distinctly skin deep affair.<br/><br/>As I felt about Reloaded, the acting, writing and action in Revolutions is very poor. Technically, the action is second to none, but like a band who are great on their instruments but can't write a song, the technical wizardry on display is rendered irrelevant by action scenes that are too long, clichéd and soulless. It doesn't help that almost every time a computer rendered Keanu Reeves or Hugo Weaving is on screen, the action goes into slow motion to make the CG patently obvious. Therefore, fights have the thrill taken out of them, as they are so obviously artificial. The one high point of the movie (setting aside Monica Belucci, who is, for various reasons, eminently watchable) is the last ditch defence of the Zion dock by the human army, which despite being poorly directed, and of course overlong, is a triumph of effects based cinema, reminiscent of the Helm's Deep battle in The Two Towers, as well as the obvious Aliens comparisons. However, this sequence is in the singular minority in terms of an exciting action scene, and even then relies heavily on cliché and suffers from predictable writing.<br/><br/>As for the writing, this is easily the weakest area of the movie. Almost sub-soap level, some of the corniest dialogue ever seen in a cinema rears its ugly head (my favourite hour was when Trinity used every cliché in the book while saying her goodbyes - or was it longer?), and characters are paper thin, particularly secondary characters such as the detestable Link (his lucky charm sub-plot enraged me - they should have paid Tank whatever he wanted to return). Incredibly, interesting characters like Morpheous, Seraph, the Merovingian and the delightful Persephone are hideously underwritten, while nonentities like Link and his wife Zee, and the Kid (from Animatrix) eat up screen time like nobody's business. Morpheous' relegation to Niobe's incompetent sidekick is especially baffling, as Laurence Fishburne is easily the hero you most root for in the previous 2 films, and along with Hugo Weaving and Monica Belucci (for slightly different reasons), the best thing in the trilogy.<br/><br/>The acting in Revolutions is equally appalling. Once again, charisma and chemistry manage to comfortably elude Keanu Reeves and the quite dreadful Carrie-Anne Moss, while the supporting cast fare little better, particularly Gloria Foster's replacement as the Oracle, Mary Alice. It is left to Hugo Weaving, and with the relegation of Fishburne to minor role, Jada Pinkett-Smith, to save face with good performances (and having said that, Weaving's Revolutions performance was the weakest of the three films). I simply did not care what happened to any of the characters (although it was mostly thoroughly predictable), and was in fact rooting for Smith, because at least he wasn't boring me.<br/><br/>Overall, the plot is what rankles, because it is such an unsatisfying conclusion. We have a trilogy where fundamentally nothing has changed as a result of the character's actions, in the end. Some questions are answered lamely, while others are not attempted. No, the rave/sex scene wasn't significant in the end. Oh, yeah, and be ready, for the last scene is the worst ever committed to film. Ever."

","Imagine yourself witnessing a magician perform the same trick over and over again, while an orchestra blares in the background. During this performance someone sneaks behind you and steals your wallet. That is the Matrix Revolutions experience in it's purest form. Revolutions main fault is that it in no way provides a conclusion, instead it employs smoke and mirror distractions by tossing overlong action sequences that have zero humanity. The entire film is merely a string of effects loosely tied together with a paper thin outline of a story. The original matrix provided many themes to explore but none of the interesting ideas get explored here. Instead of a struggle of ones inner self what this movie gives us is a bland us vs. Them bland action flick everyone seen a million times over. The story has been simplified to Neo vs. Smith instead of humanity vs. the matrix. It's what the matrix represented that made a compelling story not a dull ""look what we can do!"" mech warrior battle or the land thousand agent smiths. All of the characters are stage props for a golly giz wiz loud obnoxious effects demo. Finally the ending is quite posibly the greatest con I have ever witnessed in any medium.

So when revolutions came out I already knew the movie would be poor quality, and I didn't beleive that the Brothers Watchkowsky could make a worse film. Obviously I was wrong. I strongly believe that if Ed Wood was still alive even he could have made a better movie. Revolutions was accompanied by terrible acting, horrendus action sequences,  a  redundant storyline, and moments of complete idiocy involving screen writing decisions. The movie moved so fast that the plot had no time to enter. I say laugh a minute because that is exactly what the movie provided. About every other scene I was laughing aloud at something. Whether it was the talking machine mainframe resembling the amityville horror house, or the vague attempt to replace the character of the oracle(who died before the movie was completed). When you replace a character there are several ways to replace them without the audience batting an eyelash, and the best the brothers could come up with is something has happened.

In the first two films of this trilogy, we were left with a lot of unanswered questions. Sure, those questions are answered here, but the answers themselves are sometimes confusing and often times ridiculous. And then comes the worst part -- they turned this movie into a soppy love story!!!! If I wanted to watch a ""chick flick"", I would have watched Intolerable Cruelty or something like that. There was a period of 10 minutes where I thought I might really fall asleep. And then there was the lack of action scenes -- I believe there were only 3 main action scenes.

","A wise man once said, if you don't have anything special to say, don't say anything. The Wachowski Brothers could have done well by heeding that adage. Matrix Revolutions, like Matrix Reloaded, is a hodgepodge of confusing and divergent thoughts that make absolutely no sense, with an ending that was an incoherent letdown. All it had going for it was the CGI. The producers should have taken the blue pill and forgotten about any thoughts of making these two lame sequels to one of the greatest science fiction films ever made.<br/><br/>I had great hopes for the two sequels. Had I been in charge, I would have written it this way:<br/><br/>In Matrix Reloaded, Neo and company awaken the rest of the world. Forget Zion. Bring us fresh new characters we learn to care for. One by one, people are taken out of their ""real world"" and into the harsh realm of the Matrix. Some are angry at Neo. Some are angry at the machines. Others are helpless. (By the way, if these people were named in the ""real"" world"" why do they have names like Neo and Trinity and Morpheus?) Herein, though, comes the realization by millions of individuals that everything they have come to believe is real is not. Of course, the awakening means that the machines have lost their batteries. Enter Agent Jones. A female computer program pawn that enters the ""real world"" taking over one of the human's minds in the Matrix and competing for Neo. Neo falls in love. She doesn't even know she's really a machine. Neo finds out. But destroying the machines means destroying her. What will he choose?<br/><br/>In Matrix Revolutions, the war then begins...man vs machine. But here we discover that the ""real world"" is only one more level of the Matrix. Are the machines really machines? Who or what is behind it all? What is real? Neo discovers the answer.

In the time span of just a couple of hours, they will make their way to the dock walls of Zion on their mission to destroy Zion. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is being held captive by the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson), and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) Meanwhile, Smith (formerly Agent Smith) is spreading like a virus inside the Matrix, making copies of himself at an exponentially increasing rate. Also, his copy in the Real World inside the body of Bain (Ian Bliss), who is now conscious. Now, the future of both the Machine World and humanity lies in the hands of freed Neo, who must travel to the Machine City and talk to the Deus Ex Machina - the ultimate power in the Machine World and God of the Machines - and make a bargain for the future of both machines and humans. <br/><br/>  The acting is superb.

The final conclusion does not, in my mind, fit the overall plot of the three films - in essence, it does not solve the problem presented in the first film (the  liberation of humankind from the machines and the matrix) adequately or even at all. Some would argue otherwise. I just keep thinking back to another summer ""blockbuster"" - apocalypse postponed.<br/><br/>The special effects were disappointing although the disappearance of rubbery, digital Keanu was a blessing. The fight scenes have begun to feel a little *too* choreographed - predictable and not in the least suspenseful. Watching Neo watch Agent Smith take a 30 second run at him is inane. One wonders why he simply doesn't move out of the way if he has that much advanced warning?<br/><br/>Several large plot holes were introduced and as with the previous movies there are many intricacies that are only just hinted at and never fully examined. This may be fine for those of us who have the ability to play the related game, which apparently adds to the story. For the rest of us though, it can't help but be irritating. Character development is a little shallow and superficial; individuals like Niobe are never really allowed to develop into a satisfactory, multi-dimensional person with whom we can empathize.

Well, I've seen it, and all I can say is that perhaps I was a little too harsh on Reloaded afterall, for Revolutions was cringe-makingly bad throughout.<br/><br/>In addition to being overloaded with minor-role characters and cheesy dialogue, the film has moved away from the original so far that you wouldn't quite believe the 3rd were linked in any way to the 1st. The only good elements of Revolutions are the scenes with Agent Smith in it, which only really made up the closing stages of the film.<br/><br/>If you want the trilogy to be rescued by this installment, then you'll come away disappointed.

When I saw Reloaded I thought that the reason why this film wasn't so appealing was because I didn't understand it.  Then came the day when I found out just how good Wachowski brothers really are.<br/><br/>When the lights re-appeared and I grabbed my coat to leave the theater I was astonished.

To put it nicely I'll say that Revolutions is a badly burned soup which consists of a) clichès b) repetition c) some Matrix mythology (of course) and d) incomprehensible amount of brainless action.<br/><br/>Either Wachowskis don't know what is a clichè or then they think that the audience doesn't.  This is perhaps the most depressing feature of the film. More than few scenes are schoolbook examples of what not to do.<br/><br/>When I say repetition I mean things already done in the earlier parts and things happening in this movie.  Is anybody surprised to see Neo swirling in the air and fighting with Smith (feels quite futile at this point by the way)?  I also believe that not many are like my kid brother, now on second grade, who might just stay interested after tens of minutes of flying bullets and a bunch of sentinels).<br/><br/>I'm more than a bit disappointed to see how Wachowskis failed to keep the story coherent, intelligent or even logical (though more I'm sorry for my money that went to the ticket).  If Matrix is a big deal for you then I can't probably say anything that'll stop you from wasting your time.

","It's November, and the mindless money grubbing FX machine has rolled out in full force. Now after i've seen this movie and taken a step back, i realized that its nothing but a money train running out of control; riding the previous success of the original.<br/><br/>The matrix is a mixed bag of bad acting, over-acting, under-acting, lame moments, over the top CG and a table full of muppets. Now before you call the crazyhouse to come pick me up, allow me to explain. The bad acting is apparent everywhere. Obviously, acting was not on the menu when the director and the casting director went shopping. Keanu Reeves can't act, i'm sorry. Scene after scene of stone faced Reeves cements that fact. Can he express any emotion other than, ""Whoa!?"". Next we have over-acting which can clearly be seen by the lackies riding the robots. Especially that fool, Captain ""Constipated"". Under acting is served up by Mr. Anderson once again as his stoned face is mirrored by Trinty. Trinty, who's finally put out of her misery. They have absolutely no on screen chemistry. Now for the lame moments, they were everywhere. I found myself laughing at many parts that i don't think i was supposed to. I noticed this from the entire audience i was with. From the stupid looks on the faces of Zionians to the stupid poses by Agent Smith. The computer graphics which looked alright in most parts was just too overwhelming. You can't make the backbone of a movie the CG. It looks cheap and fake. Case in point, the little slow-motion punch by Neo delivered to a rubber faced Agent Smithers. Also bad was the little drill machines that broke through the walls of Zion. You know what they looked like? I'm sure i wasn't the only one who thought this but they looked like little turds squeezing through and plopping down in the drain. Now whats more annoying than a civilization in peril, who are controlled by a group who does absolutely nothing to help, nothing to contribute but scorn and ridicule those who are trying to help? I'll tell you what more annoying, when they're looking like a table of muppets or circus freaks. Looks like someone freed the freak section of the matrix and let loose the circus of poor fashion sense. This ""council"" is nothing more than a table full of geriatrics with dreadlocks and hippie stink. They should have loaded a canon full of their useless hippie carcuses and fired them at the squids.<br/><br/>That brings me to another geriatric. Colonel Sanders, aka, the architect. When i saw him, i started getting cravings for fried chicken. How are we suppose to take this movie seriously when the dude who supposedly created the matrix looks like he should be on a bucket of fried poultry?<br/><br/>Now finally comes the count down to the ""END""...that makes no sense:<br/><br/>1.The long struggle against the machines. Lets not forget, has been going on for centuries.<br/><br/>2.The programs which the machines created to control the minds of their energy providing blood sacks.<br/><br/>3.An actual physical war that is ongoing.<br/><br/>4.Insignificant rogue program that could have easily been erased. (lets not forget the story from the original where the original matrix was a paradise but didn't work, so they simply erased and created a new one).<br/><br/>5.Zion on the ropes and literally about to be crushed.<br/><br/>6.Neo the moron, strikes a deal with machines to terminate the rogue program. *Now lets take a look back* Why would the machines need Neo to take care of Smith? Why wouldn't the machines simple unplug the matrix and reset it? I guess were suppose to be too stupid to think that up. The writers obviously didn't give us much credit.<br/><br/>7.The stupid fight which ended with a stupid ending as Smith terminates himself, knowing full well that he was doing what he shouldn't.<br/><br/>
8.Then the really dumb part comes. Neo had struck a deal with the machines. *Now lets take another step back* The machines hate humans and have eraticated them in the past, bringing them back as their food source. Now that 1 human has helped them swat a fly that they could have swat themselves, suddenly all is forgiven. Those who want to leave the matrix ,can and the machines suddenly allow their food to run away.<br/><br/>Now what should have happened in that situation by all logical thinking is that the machines kept on attacking Zion, crushed the resistence and continue living and thriving off the bodies of those who remain in the matrix.<br/><br/>What this movie failed to do, is it failed to accomplish its main objective. In part 1, the main objective of the resistence as we were lead to believe is to topple the machines and take back the earth. Have they done that? Obviously not. No they supposedly live in harmony with the machines who have enslaved them for centuries. The tag line was, what has a beginning, has and end? It should have been, What has a beginning takes a break, and we won't show you the end.<br/><br/>Lastly, a parting thought...Is this a Matrix movie in the sense that what we were served up in part one was ""the Matrix""? Heck no. All the style is gone, all the flair, all the coolness. Its all gone. This and Reloaded were nothing more then taking what was ""cool"" and ""hip"" in the original and milking it for all its worth. In reloaded we were drilled by the martial arts and leather jackets, over and over again till we puked. In this installment we were drilled with the special effects.<br/><br/>ALL IN ALL: Nothing but a conglomerate of cliches and bad story telling.<br/><br/>1 out of 10<br/><br/>Bring on the King...The Return of the King!"

","but not a very good movie.  the final, climactic fight scene was so disappointing that I watched the last half of Clone Wars again to see if the Matrix had really lowered the bottom.  It had.  At least Clone Wars had a closing battle with Count Chokula that had some tension and was visually interesting.  The rain-obscured scene between Neo and Smith, filled with repetitive dialog, had no building tension, no sense of danger, and ultimately no meaning. I also watched, just for contrast, the final fight scene in a very low-budget movie called ""Switchblade Sisters.""  Though not great, with some of it done in silhouette, it's still pretty tense, has a slight sense of believability and vulnerability.  The budget is probably lower than just one of Carrie-Ann Moss' leather outfits."

It looked like a video game, don't tell me video games were modeled after the film. Hello! Film making is an art not a game. It was repetitive and boring. At least Trinity and Neo died, I mean if they lived then that would have been worse, a happy ending, oh god how many more do we need?

"JerryLambert","10","0","1","6 November 2003"," Revolutions Review
","This is the third and final installment, or so they say , of the Matrix. Here is where you will see the fate of Neo and his counter part Agent Smith. Smith has become unstoppable at this point. The machines are going to attack Zion and humanity must prevail or be inihalated.  Seeing this movie is comparable to going to Disney World for 2 and a half hours. It concludes the story and reveals the purpose of The One, or at least the purpose of Neo. It is a movie that is scary for it's hard bearing truth. The movie starts out slow. As Neo is trapped in Limbo Trinity, Morpheus and Seraph try to find him and bring him back to Zion. There is a very cool scene involving some coat check guys at a place called Hel Club, what appears to be an S&M club. While there , Trinity gets to be a total bad ass. She proclaims her purpose to The Merovingian played by Lambert Wilson. There is a battle between Zion and the machines. This battle is as hard core as it gets.  At one point I was wishing for it to stop. Not because it was repetitive or boring, but because I just wanted this war to end. One thing that I thought was missing from the second installment was blood. The final episode makes up for the blood missing from the second by adding more blood and a hefty pinch of gore.  What happens from there you will have to see for yourself. This is my second favorite movie of all time.  If you haven't seen this movie I suggest that you go out right now and see it. After you have seen the first two.<br/><br/>
The Matrix Trilogy is the most fascinating and inspirational story of modern times. This is what film making is about and I hope to see other films follow suit. This is what I live for. To be taken into a different world and inspired by it is something that i enjoy. I can't imagine anyone ever topping this trilogy. I also consider The Matrix as a historical event in that it gave us hope in times of doubt. It shows us the reality of our sins and explores the benefit of faith.  If you can't get into the story , watch it just for the spectacle. If you do get into the story, well then , welcome to the desert of the real my friend.<br/><br/>

"barbeejp","1","0","1","6 November 2003"," Worthless piece of eye candy
","This movie was positively awful.  First off the actors failed miserably to deliver a convincing performance.  Their complete ineptitude combine with the poor<br/><br/>writing and terrible plot constituted no emotional involvement whatsoever for the audience.  In order for any type of theatre to be successful it must draw the audience into its world and this movie absolutely did not do that.  For a movie that involved the annihilation of the human race I found myself, in the end, not caring which side won.  The special effects were impressive, but battle scenes were all far far too long.  We can only watch a person stand and shoot things out of the sky for so long and for incredibly sophisticated war machines the robots strategy of never attacking and flying around in a large swirling cloud while the humans slowly pick away at their numbers sure didn't seem very effective. Plus why don't any of the machines have any sort of projectile weapons?  As for the final battle of Neo and Smith it resembled a very poor rendition of a Dragon Ball Z battle and was again either far to long or repetitive to keep our interest.  On the whole this movie was terrible and definitely worth full price.  If you feel you must see it then go to a matinee, but I wouldn't pay a dime to watch it."

Nobody will ever make the mistake that Reloaded was a movie on the level of the original but at least it tried.  Revulsions however should have gone straight to video.  What were they thinking with this film?  I kept waiting for Richard Prior's character from Superman 3 to come in and resume his role of the computer hacker because the acting and storyline were on par with that film.  The Wachowskis have shown their brilliance with Bound and the Matrix but these two sequels have gotten them in the same category as Michael Bay and Tony Scott as hack directors. As for Warner Bros., take a look at what your competition is doing with their franchises: New Line has structured a beautiful trilogy out of the Lord of the Rings 20th Century Fox has done wonders with the X-Men franchise and is able to keep the 30 year old Star Wars franchise fun still. Shame on everyone associated with the last two films of this series.<br/><br/>In 20 years you will find that people will continue to return to the original Matrix but will never quite find the energy to insert that Reloaded or Revulsions disk into their players.

","This would have been a cool movie, if it would have had a plot that could hold a candle to the first movie. The ending makes you wonder if the director was told he was running out of film (or CG computing...) and the movie had to end in 5 minutes. (I know! He'll explode! It'll make perfect sense....) Neo develops even more ridiculous abilities that aren't grounded unless you believe he's some type of demigod. In the first movie, his powers are explained in a way that is very logical. The Matrix is a virtual reality, and is defined by rules. Rules that can be bent because nothing is real. The second movie gives him an affinity with machines (i guess)... that lets him see machine entities in some type of red glowing-ness. But the third movie? Come on! When he loses his eyesight, and starts blowing up squids by the thousands, its just stupid. It doesn't make any sense at all. I was waiting for some awesome revelation, maybe that the world of zion was part of the matrix, and that could explain Neo's increasing powers. Also, what happened to the Frenchman? He decides he wants the eyes of the oracle in the first five minutes, is told no at gunpoint, and is never seen again. Ridiculously bad scripting! You don't introduce a villain and then leave him out of the plot and forget about him. Also the ending conversation between the Architect and the Oracle made me want to burn my ticket. Whoever wrote this movie obviously didn't see the first one. The Architect agrees to free the humans...but...HUMANS ARE THE POWER SUPPLY THAT KEEPS THE MACHINES ALIVE!

Okay, ""hate"" is too strong a word, but it was a major disappointment.

Be a bit subtle and let us feel smart that we were able to figure it out for ourselves.

","Greetings again from the darkness.  OK, the trilogy is over.  Neither of the sequels stand up to the fascinating and ground breaking first, but despite the script flaws and oft-lacking dialog, all three stand as tremendous action/special effects movies.  Revolutions tries to tie up the loose ends regarding purpose and especially death.  Keanu and Carrie-Ann are off screen for way too long during the battle to save the dock.  Hugo Weaving, as Mr. Smith, is again both entertaining and frightening, but he also is off screen for extended periods.  Jada Pinkett Smith looks great, but could have probably pulled off her role in the last 2 without the hours of training. She gets to flaunt very little of her powered-up body.  The best movies rely on the story and characters.  The Matrix trilogy began with an interesting story and screwed it up.  Its best characters were there til the end, but somehow we are left unfulfilled.  The action, on the other hand, is probably beyond compare up to this point in cinema."

","Short dialogues, good animated actions and great background-story - that was ""The Matrix"", the year 1999. An excellent movie, which is one of my personal favorites.<br/><br/>Now the story extended into a trilogy. ""The Matrix"", ""Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Matrix Revolutions"". If I would try to describe the movies in one, two words it would look just like this: The Matrix - Awesome Matrix Reloaded - Horrible Matrix Revolutions - &/%¤""%¤#<br/><br/>The main questions: Will Neo save the humans? Will he be victorious over the machines? Will that ""love-story"" between him and Trinity have a happy ending? The answer is...that those questions won't even be answered! Even worse, we get to see a quiet many dialogues, which no one will understand. The firs half an hour everyone just rounds around, making sure that they have no clue what is going on. Trinity talks and talks and talks...even when she is about to die! With the ""dreamworld"" matrix the whole movie has nothing to do any more. And where did all those poor humans in the power plant go? Those are not of interest to our heroes any more anyways. Zion furthermore is representative for all humans. Zion, however, is quiet boring. And the fighting scene between Neo and Agent Smith? It is longer than 20 minutes - I was about to fall asleep.<br/><br/>Let's face it: That movie is definitely not worth watching it!<br/><br/>Now, I'm longing for the blue pill from the first part of this trilogy. Let's hope they will spare us a forth part..."

"rchosen","1","0","1","5 November 2003"," AS A DIE HARD MATRIX FAN READ THE BEST REVIEW......
","Ok the first one had lots of bullet time and a great story and was perfect. Then there was the second one which was better but had less bullet time. Now there is the final movie which besides the defending of Zion had crappy action and no bullet time.<br/><br/>As i die hard Matrix fan i was very disapointed. Ill say the bad points further in  but as of now there is one thing that bugs me for younger people seeing this and that is that they dont need sexuality. The second one had basically a wet tshirt orgy. It also showed Neo and Trin making love in a artistic way but then they show them moaning and groaning which wasnt needed. In this one in a party club you see two topless girls doing sexual thigns to each others chests. This to me really makes a movie  have less of a good rating.<br/><br/>WANT REALLY REALLY REALLY was horrid about this movie(Spoilers noted):<br/><br/>Spoiler-The fact the Trinity dies isnt that bad but the fact that theres a long sad speech that sounds liek what she always says in the other movies makes it a yawner and not that sad.<br/><br/>Spoiler-WHAT HAPPENED TO MORHPEUS??? Just like in the first one he makes speeches except these arent long there medium length and about every 10 minutes. They ruined his charecter.<br/><br/>Spoiler-What the heck was with the stupid comedy in it? Like agent smith taking over the Oracle and then the taked over Oracle laughing. WHAT??<br/><br/>Spoiler-Is it just me or has the ending been left open for more movies? For instance the Oracle says ""We havent seen the last of him"" or perhaps the fact that theres no the peace between machines and humans will last. What about the Matrix itself? If there is no one there then someone explain the point? So many questions such mind boggling theorys!<br/><br/>
MY OVERALL THOUGHT: With the lack of Bullet Time, Action and acting this movie is horrid whats worse is that the story is like forced a bunch of puzzle pieces into places they dont fit. If you are or are not a Matirx fan id see it at least once. I personally think with the ending the way it was that the makers of the trilogy are planning another movie secretly or some tv series because to many things scream expansion. See the move and see why.<br/><br/>SIDE NOTE FOR PEOPLE THAT LIKE MECHS....YOULL LOVE THE MECH BATTLE! The battle for zion is the best scene ive ever seen in a movie!"

","I enjoyed this movie very much and felt that it fit very well into the Matrix series.<br/><br/>First off let me just say that I don't believe the Matrix is a Trilogy as it has been reported so often.  It is only 2 movies with the second one being split in half.  I've heard a lot of bad reviews saying that Reloaded didn't have enough conflict or resolution and Revolutions has no character development.  I watched Reloaded at home directly before leaving to see Revolutions and I believe they complimented each other perfectly.  Alone they each have their problems - but together they made a wonderful sequal to the first which fit right in line.  I would recomend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the first.<br/><br/>I found it just as thought provoking and inspiring as the original and would highly recomend this movie along with the others as a whole."

You're just waiting for these boring fights to end soon. There's not one single interesting thing in that ""movie"".

","I'll attempt not to put too many spoilers in this one, but there WILL BE SOME.  If you don't want any spoilers, DO NOT READ any further...<br/><br/>First, I'm above all else, a die-hard Matrix fan.  I loved the first one, and even thought the ""Reloaded"" was brilliant.  Reloaded was very thought provoking, well written, and really worked very well as a ""bridge"" in the trilogy.  I was very much looking forward to the third installment, even taking the day off of work to go and see it.<br/><br/>All I can say is, WHAT were the Wachowski brothers THINKING?  The mind-bending plots of the first two were completely non-existent in this one.<br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/><br/>Early on, the battle at Zion begins, and as predicted, the humans are getting thoroughly thrashed. This became a running theme for the movie. EVERYONE gets their butts beat from start to finish, even up to the end of the movie.  The 2 1/2 hour battle at Zion takes a break only long enough to bring you to a Neo/Agent Smith battle in the Matrix.  This is the plot, people.  No more, no less.  Everyone loses, to boot.  Zion gets their butts kicked, Neo gets his butt kicked, and it gets even WORSE from there.  Almost nothing is accomplished (a temporary truce goes up between man and machine, and the Matrix still stands.)<br/><br/>My recommendation, though it really pains me to say this, is that you wait for it to come out on DVD, and watch it at a friend's house when THEY buy it.  I own the Animatrix, The Matrix, and both Widescreen and Fullscreen versions of The Matrix: Reloaded.  I'm debating whether or not to even spend the money when this one's released.<br/><br/>If you don't want to have to think about a movie, and you're just interested in some sci-fi eye candy watching people in machines shoot at other machines, this would be the movie for you.<br/><br/>I think the Wachowski brothers really need to pull this one out of theaters NOW, and change it while there's still SOME chance to save face."

The new Oracle and the insufficient explanation why there even is a new one are disappointing as well as the half told story of this Indian girl/program and the final purpose of the Trainman.
