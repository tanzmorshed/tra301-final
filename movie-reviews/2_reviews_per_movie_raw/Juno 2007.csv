","I rarely go the movies, I watch them on cable or rent them usually. When I heard about Juno I was interested but afraid it would disappoint. I Forgot about it and probably would have never seen it if I had not stumbled on it on cable one lazy Sunday afternoon. I think there are some very valid criticisms of the movie and of course there are some errors and questionable choices made, but the movie was filmed in 31 days which I find amazing.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I was afraid to see Juno was that I was Juno. Okay a little different but let's just say 17 and a senior in high school instead of 16 and a junior, everything else very similar. The biggest difference-I never met my child's adoptive parents.<br/><br/>I stupidly got pregnant though I knew better. Almost right away I realized abortion was not for me and that I was not ready to be a mom. No one ever talked about that 20 something years ago. You either had an abortion and no one knew or you kept the baby. At least that is the way it seemed to me.(not true I know but almost no one talked about adoption) Juno's character is quirky. I don't find her annoying in the least. She is a smart kid and she acts like one. While I can understand why some feel this movie showed teen pregnancy as having no consequences I disagree. The consequences are real for Juno. She has to deal with being pregnant, with finding adoptive parents she likes and trusts. She has to deal with school, her best friend Bleeker's emotions, her own emotions.<br/><br/>It is all done subtly and actually very realistically to me. Its a snapshot of what occurred. We don't know every moment of emotion and how Juno dealt with it. We do know at the end she was crying very heartfelt tears and that she felt she picked the best situation for her baby.<br/><br/>Its a gamble, there are no guarantees and she deals with that fact the best she can. I find her innocent relationship with Mark Loring very believable and the shaky marriage of Mark and Vanessa as real as it gets.<br/><br/>Yes Juno's parents seem to be over the top understanding. However you can tell they are simply accepting, loving people and are there for their daughter, why is that such a stretch for people to believe? I think this was well written, well acted, well cast and very real. The message is not that teen pregnancy and adoption is easy. To me this is one girl's story. It wasn't easy but she made the best of it and carried on with her life and gave her child a good start. As for a 16 year old knowing the references and music that Juno did, well in this day and age every one has access to old music, old TV shows, movies, etc. So its very plausible that Juno is a fan of the 1977 era and has been exposed to it via internet, cable and recordings.<br/><br/>It has flaws, and missteps but certainly in the end a great film and one I will watch again and again. As someone who has been through this I cried my eyes out and they were happy tears, to see that some one else saw it the way I did when I was where Juno was."
"ceburo","4","279","432","21 February 2008"," about as indie as Avril is punk rock
","I rarely post things on internet blogs but this is a bit of a concern of mine. I am worried that beautiful films such as L'Infant are going to now be classified in the same category as Juno. I understand the mass appeal of this movie-- the mainstream audience being confused and thinking it's an indie flick by the gritty film used and the obscure references but Juno is in no way an independent film. I think why it is so ineffective is because the audience it was trying to attract (the movie fanatics who hate big budget Hollywood junk i.e. anything with Jessica alba in it) saw it for what it really was: Hollywood junk wrapped up in a converse shoelace bow. It was as indie as Avril is punk rock.<br/><br/>Furthermore it is (in my opinion) a tasteless, pointless movie. For the majority of the film I am more annoyed with Juno than I am sympathetic to her plight. I also have a hard time relating to her as she is NOT a 16year old but rather a 35year olds characterization of a 16 year old (does this make sense?) I have NEVER heard a teenager / young adult in my life ever utter ridiculous lines such as ""honest to blog?"" or ""yea I'm total for-shiz"". What the hell? I thought maybe a stripper turned blogger would have been a little more able to develop a story with characters that are down to earth but this Juno character is absurd.<br/><br/>Plus the rest of the film is completely underdeveloped-- you never see the relationship with her stepmother develop or understand why it is the way it is. Her relationship with bleaker has maybe 25 minutes but it is in no way a developed understood relationship. In fact he's barely even seen! The summary of the movie includes the words ""and with her beautiful friends help"" but in the movie there is absolutely no connection with her friends beauty and the relevance of it. Was there supposed to be some conflict? All these story arcs that were never completed.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed with this movie. Fox searchlight has produced many good films (notes on a scandal, little miss sunshine, the last king of Scotland, etc) but this is just an embarrassment. It wasn't as though the actors were bad-- Michael Cera as usual plays the adorable awkward adolescent and Ellen page, Jason Batemen, Jennifer Gardner, etc play their roles respectively but the whole premise of the movie was so over the top and unrealistic. Oscar worthy? It's ludicrous. This is a movie worth missing."

","This could have been a very, very good film. I enjoyed the basic plot - a quirky, tomboy-ish 16 year old discovers she's pregnant, decides to give the baby up for adoption to the ""perfect couple"" but finds that the perfect couple isn't so perfect - and maybe no relationship ever is.<br/><br/>There were also some great moments, and great lines. I like when Juno tells the baby's quirky father, Bleeker (played by Michael Cera) that he is the coolest person she knows, without even trying. And he responds that, actually, he is trying really hard (to be cool).<br/><br/>I guess that gets me to the problem with the movie- it's trying waaaaay too hard to be cool (by being quirky - yes I have used this word 3 times already, intentionally). In the beginning, a store clerk sees that Juno's pregnancy test is positive, and he says: ""that's one diddle that can't be undone, home-skillet"". I cringed. As others have mentioned, Juno has an ""ironic"" hamburger phone, wears ""ironic"" t-shirts featuring 70's era toys (Slinky), wears Converse sneakers, and can't seem to have a conversation without making pop-culture references no matter what is going on - even when her water breaks and she is headed to the hospital, she has the detached sense of irony to make a reference to a mid-80's cartoon, yelling: ""Thundercats are go!"" I cringed again. I get it - Juno is a hip, snarky, ironic, tough, cool-because-she-trying-not-to-be-cool chick. But she becomes a cartoon, a warped caricature of an actual quirky kid. I could not accept Juno as ""real"" and was painfully aware that I was watching a movie.<br/><br/>And that is my ONLY problem with the film. The other characters and their stories are amazing - particularly the adoptive couple, and the difficulties they are facing. The best parts of the movie are those few moments when Juno gets her uber-ironic self off the screen, and we get to enjoy the other, more realistic, characters.<br/><br/>Would have given this a 8.5, if not for the cartoonish-ness of the Juno character. Thundercats are not go."
"isabelle1955","Null","662","1089","13 January 2008"," Manipulative and Simplistic
","Look, I do get it. I fully appreciate that a film about a girl who gets pregnant, has an early abortion, then manages to move on, would be a pretty short movie. In fact, so short it wouldn't get made. No one wants to know about reality. And certainly in 21st century North America, no one wants to portray abortion as a viable option. Very, very bad form currently.<br/><br/>But when I see this film reviewed as ""blazingly truthful"" and the pregnant 16 year old central character described as being 'in a pickle', as I did in one review, as if perhaps she'd forgotten a homework assignment and might get detention, I have to admit that the cynic who lurks in my soul gets full rein. This is basically a cutesy film about being pregnant at 16, where despite a few problems, everyone gets to live pretty much happily ever after. Gosh, girl in a pickle comes good! Ahhh!! And apparently everyone in the cinema where I saw it was quite overwhelmed by attacks of the warm fuzzies, except me. Two seats away, a woman slightly older than me was weeping joyfully by the end while behind me, young women were giggling happily as sweet Juno's bump grew. Good grief! Is this really a message we want to give to 16 year olds? <br/><br/>I'm beginning to think I'm something of an oddity. You see, I don't find it 'blazingly truthful' that a bright, resourceful and articulate 16 year old as Juno is portrayed, would be so dumb as to have inadequately protected sex then seem surprised to find herself up the spout. One point of the script is that Juno herself apparently initiated the sex, thought it through in advance in fact, because she was bored. I therefore assume the pregnancy was at least to some extent planned. And if she really had no idea that sex might lead to pregnancy, her parents (portrayed as bemused but supportive), should be excoriated for such inadequate parenting. And if I see one more review which describes Juno as a comedy about growing up 'and the bumps along the way.' (I'm prepared to bet good money on that having been written by a middle aged man), I swear I'm going to run amok in the local mall with a urine dip stick. Being pregnant at 16 isn't a sweet joke, abortion clinics (whatever you think of their morality - and I'm neutral on that) are not run by morons, and while Juno has some amusing one-liners, and a good central performance from Ellen Page, it is basically a deeply flawed, superficial movie which is trying too hard to be cute. It's extremely manipulative.<br/><br/>I'm going to be very controversial and suggest that far from being surprised by an unplanned pregnancy, Juno might actually be a very willful young woman who wants to add pregnancy/childbirth/adoption to her 'experiments-in-living' list. At everyone else's expense. It certainly makes her the center of attention. She wouldn't be the first girl to get pregnant for that reason.<br/><br/>I found the situation between the adoptive parents more convincing. Childless Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) is desperate for a baby. Husband Mark is not so sure, and does at least eventually face up to the truth of his uncertainty by making a break for it. He may be 40 going on 18, but he's being honest about it. And for me the most moving scene in the whole film was when Vanessa held the newborn child in her arms for the first time, having decided to go it alone as a mother anyway. If there is a message to be taken from this movie, it's possibly that becoming a mother when the time is right, is just fine. <br/><br/>A superficial, cutesy, lightweight movie. The fact it was written by a woman is no excuse. I am gobsmacked that it's been nominated."
"mrethanboy","6","212","339","16 January 2008"," A shallow, poorly considered exploitation of these important issues
","At first blush, ""Juno"" seems like a pretty great movie. It's entertaining and lots of fun to watch. There's a great cast, and each of the film's characters are well-sketched and interesting. First-rate cinematography keeps the film colorful and engaging from start to finish. There are more than enough quirks, witty dialogues and obscure name-droppings to keep the hipsters placated. Perhaps it's just a bit pretentious and tries just a bit too hard, but these flaws could be overlooked. The movie should have been a charming little indie-lite film.<br/><br/>But it's not. Ultimately, I stepped out of the theater feeling frustrated and unsatisfied. The problem is that ""Juno"" tackles two very relevant issues in today's society - namely, abortion and teenage pregnancy - and utterly fails to address either in a way that is realistic or compelling. Now, maybe it's unfair to expect Juno to make a decent exploration of these complex themes. It's just a comedy, after all. However, even as many critics praise the movie's keen humor and witty banter, it's hard not to get caught up in the fact that this movie painfully abuses these highly relevant issues.<br/><br/>In one particularly wince-worthy scene, Juno's stepmother tells off an ultrasound technician for indicating that teenage mothers are less capable of taking care of their kids than adults. She argues that teenagers could be just as devoted to their children as their adult counterparts, and that she should stick to the things that she knows about. Instead of defending her position, the technician wordlessly exits while Juno, her friend and her stepmother exchange verbal high-fives.<br/><br/>The film makes offers no exploration of the ultrasound technician's completely valid viewpoint. Are teenagers ready to leave school to get a job and start supporting a dependent of their own? Are these kids really mature enough to tackle these issues? Should they have to? Does the amount of devotion to the baby really matter when you can hardly afford food and shelter? These relevant questions are left unasked. The scene is telling of either the director's ignorance or else his pointed attempt to skew facts to make a point, and neither shines well on the movie.<br/><br/>Juno MacGuff seems to be living in a dream world. Never mind her ridiculous vocabulary or unrealistically snappy sarcasm  her parents barely react to the news of her pregnancy, she almost effortlessly finds parents to adopt her unborn child (in a newspaper want ad, no less), the legal issues are smoothed out in the span of 30 seconds and Juno's social ostracism is hinted at but hardly explored in any meaningful way. Instead of getting a believable portrayal of teenage pregnancy, the film offers the pretentious name-dropping of hip punk bands. At one point, Juno actually says ""Sonic Youth is just noise"" as a biting insult. It's all a tad ridiculous.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, perhaps none of this should interfere with enjoyment of the movie. Perhaps one should gloss over the film's aggravating biases and enjoy what is otherwise a great film. However, the fact remains that Juno passes itself as an artsy independent film about teenage pregnancy and abortion, but it is little more than a shallow, poorly considered exploitation of these important issues."
"roy-zornow","2","124","194","19 April 2008"," Critic's drool over slack ""Juno""
","What is it about any movie that shows a hip white woman bringing her baby to term that causes film critics to temporarily lose their minds? ""Knocked Up"" was given a free pass and Juno is inspiring some of the worst film criticism I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The truth is that ""Juno"" is a calculatedly juvenile film with an immensely appealing main actress (Ellen Page), fake meta-dialog, and an inability to follow-through on its central theme of abandonment.<br/><br/>Juno is constructed so as to allow moviegoers to feel as if they've gone through a significant emotional journey, without doing the work. One way it blunts serious emotions is through the use of hipster patois in the place of real dialog. Rob Harvilla, a music critic with the Village Voice described this best:<br/><br/>""Teenagers who talk like thirtysomething screenwriters. ""Cool"" parents who talk like teenage screenwriters. A 16-year-old heroine who actually says things like ""Just looking to secure a hasty abortion!"" and ""Just dealing with things way outside my maturity level!"" and (grits teeth) ""Swear to blog!"". Just appallingly cute cute cute CUTE CUTE."" The cutesy dialog has been universally panned in reviews, but its also serving to throw critics off serious discussion of the film's major shortcomings. A.O. Scott in the New York Times:<br/><br/>""...not many are so daring in their treatment of teenage pregnancy, which this film flirts with presenting not just as bearable but attractive. Kids, please! Heed the cautionary whale. But in the meantime, have a good time at ""Juno."" Bring your parents, too."" Scott cannot resist writing in a similar style to the dialog, in fact thinking in this teenage way. ""Heed the cautionary whale. But in the meantime, have a good time at ""Juno."" I don't know anyone personally who has brought a pregnancy to term and given up her baby, but I can imagine it's a lot more painful and less attractive than is portrayed in Juno. No amount of squiggly animated fonts and warbly hypersincere outsider-style singing can make up for that fact, and pretending otherwise is the opposite of daring.<br/><br/>At one point in the film, after he adoptive couple has seen their relationship dissolve, the character Juno gives voice to the main point of the movie. She says something like: ""I just want to know that love can last. That two people can love each other and it's not going to go away."" A movie-sequence childbirth follows, then a shot of Juno saying she does not want to see her newborn, followed by a single tear coursing down her face. Cut to a postpartum Juno, happily riding her bike, spitting wisecracks and singing twee duets, with the afraid-of-his-own-shadow Paul Cera.<br/><br/>I'm not being a moralist here, I don't want to see the character Juno punished for giving up her baby. But it's an unsatisfying experience to have the main theme of the movie evaporate, and to instead be fed a dose of indy candy rather than a resolution, or at least a coherent point of view. Critics have responded to this shortcoming by either ignoring it - offering, as Scott does, a blithe positive assessment of the films earnestness, or else, as Stephanie Zacharek does in Salon, constructing tortuous ""filmic"" criticism:<br/><br/>""Juno"" is partly about the necessity of making choices for ourselves, but it's also about knowing when we need to accept help from others. That idea is never spelled out in so many words; it comes through in the actors' faces. ""Language is the house man lives in,"" Jean-Luc Godard told us, borrowing from Martin Heidegger, in ""Two or Three Things I Know About Her."" There are lots of words in ""Juno."" But in the end, it's really all about language."" OK I'm going to let the royal ""we"" pass. Her evasive argument reminds me of ""cold-readings"" by psychics, who employ verbal tricks to keep their marks engaged: ""you're a shy person, but if it's something you care about you have strong opinions, although you mainly keep them to yourself, but when the chips are down..."" Zacharek's version is: ""it's all about language, but not the talking kind, but instead the kind you find in actor's faces, when they are letting you know they need help, which is really what it's all about, just ask Jean-Luc Godard, when he borrows from Martin Heiddeger."" Anything to keep abandonment at bay.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's a zeitgeist thing, there seems to be a generalized post 9/11 anxiety about the future of mankind, for example the spate of recent movies about apocalyptic threats to civilization (cf. ""Cloverfield"", ""I am Legend""). Combine this with role-uncertainty created by modern decisions to delay childbearing (cf. Lori Gottlieb's article ""Marry Him"" in the Atlantic Monthly), and the result may be that a simple squiggly-lined movie about a young woman's lack of anxiety in furthering the human race has an appeal that is irresistible. Just not to me.<br/><br/>Swear to blog."
"shizz_27","7","160","256","16 October 2007"," Let's not get carried away, people.
","""Juno"" is funny (nearly every single line of dialogue is written to elicit laughter), directed with at just as sure a hand as ""Thank You For Smoking"".. possibly surer.. and acted gamely by the whole cast -- especially Olvia Thirlby and J.K. Simmons as the title character's galpal and understanding dad. The script, by Diablo Cody, is rich with one-liners; anyone who's read Candy Girl (which is unbelievably intelligent and funny; her description of Shania Twain, especially, had me rolling) will kind of know what to expect.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt Ellen Page's show. She's in almost every scene, and I couldn't spot an instalnce when she made a bad decision or timed a delivery anything but dead-on. During a funky, kick azz opening title sequence, Juno is on her way to the pharmacy. ""I just drank my weight in Sunny D, and gotta go, pronto!"" It's time for another pregnancy test, because the last result looked more like a division symbol than a plus sign. New stick: same plus.<br/><br/>The father's a guy Juno had sex with once upon a time, who also happens to be her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (a non-affected, quite bland Michael Cera). She decides to give it up for adoption, being 16 and all, which Paulie supports -- as do Juno's father and step-mom -- and the rest of the film is about her selection of adoptive parents.<br/><br/>Pretty straightforward storytelling, but with an ear for quirky, hip dialogue. If the spoken words were any more ""cool"", or the actors speaking them did so with any less suave, my gag reflex might have taken over. The AFF audience I saw it with, last Sunday, couldn't get enough from the second Juno tells a dog to shut up, through lines comparing babies to iPods and Alison Janney going off on a physician.<br/><br/>There's good stuff, here. And even though it never really swept me off my feet, the film is consistently humorous and, in one scene near the end, somewhat heartbreaking."

","I must be the only person who can honestly say I didn't crack a smile once throughout the entire movie. It was hard for me to smile because I was busy being irritated at the horrible dialogue and annoying ""jokes"" spewed out by Juno and her stupid friends. Perhaps the worst part of all was the irritating and unnecessary indie ""girl with a guitar"" music constantly fading in and out throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The pattern to ""Juno"" was more or less like this: ""I have a hamburger phone"" *insert music to show how quirky Juno is with her hamburger phone* ""Umm dad I got pregnant"" *insert music to show what a dilly of a pickle Juno is in* ""Ah well, stuff happens"" says the dad *insert indie guitar with girl singing about how stuff happens* So just imagine 96 minutes of that kind of manure.<br/><br/>I respect Ellen Page as an actress but this movie is just too annoying. The only part of the movie I really enjoyed and seemed to have any depth to it was the situation with the couple who wanted to adopt Juno's child and their relationship. They were complex and real, and actually made me feel really sad and pity them.<br/><br/>I read through some reviews and I do not see any connections between Juno and Family Guy humor. I love Family Guy, and Juno is nothing like it. If I had to compare Juno to any movie I would say that it's a failed wannabe of Napoleon Dynamite."

","I saw this movie at a preview in St. Louis about ten days ago and can't stop thinking about it.<br/><br/>I had no expectations going in (as I was given three free passes) as I took my teenage daughter and her friend. Learning about the subject matter, I was quite anxious how it would be shown and frankly I thought it was done very well.<br/><br/>First of all everyone has gone to High School with a Juno. That smart alec independent tomboy, cute, refreshing & fun to be around but not cool to date or be seen with. And the further removed from high school you are, you look back and wonder why? The acting by Ellen Page was outstanding (I had no clue who Ellen Page was - I have since watched Hard Candy). I can't remember a film that I was so drawn in by the main character.<br/><br/>I've always told friends for me the mark of a good movie is the character actors and their performances. They all deliver in this movie. I'm not going to go overboard and say its the best movie this year but it is one that I would recommend.

"helenemarguerite","3","165","272","23 January 2008"," a little false
","The sixteen year old pregnant girl is played brilliantly by Ellen. She is depicted as a confident and autonomous young person making extremely important life decisions. She does this without any discernible guidance, except for the disproportionate weight she places on a placard-bearing peer, who advises her that her unborn already has fingernails. Hence, she abandons her original and previously unchallenged plan of abortion, in favour of finding some infertile yuppie adopters to be recipients of a free baby.<br/><br/>What irks me horribly about this (popular!) movie, is the dishonest account given to teen viewers about the impact and consequence of teenage pregnancy, childbirth and in this case, surrender of a newborn without even looking at it! That is, no account, representation or hint is given about any of these issues. It's as if a 16 year old girl can uneventfully travel through the gestation and parturition and surrender and there are no great issues to debate about that.<br/><br/>Quite irresponsible and potentially damaging to young girls making life decisions."
"happy-vega","1","92","147","10 May 2008"," Don't believe the Hype
","This movie is way over-hyped. Most of the time I was just annoyed by most of the things on the screen.<br/><br/>First of all the dialog is something a 16 year old girl would never say. Too hip, witty, and glib for anybody. She sounded like she was reading a screenplay, which she was. I mean it was sssooo bad that it took me out of the picture. Right then, it could no longer be a semi- serious drama. I think it was trying to be an updated version of Heathers, but failed miserably.<br/><br/>Then, start-up the eclectic cool indie music stolen out of a Wes Anderson movie. I love Wes' movies but Juno is not that, its a wannabe. The hip music comes on all the time, to fill in the missing script no doubt. At the end of the film maybe the last 5-10 minutes there must be about 5-7 different songs one after another each for a different sequence. It was way too much. What do you do when you can;t raise the emotion with dialog, put in music and lots of it. Once you pay attention to it, its almost laughable. Its about the only thing I laughed at in this movie.<br/><br/>Another Wes Anderson ripoff was the runners running through the movie. This reminded me of Tenebaums with the gypsy taxi gag.<br/><br/>And lastly. She finally decides she's in love, still treating the guy like crap and always will. They should have a sequel to this crap movie where 3 days later they break up because she's cursing Bleeker out and treating him with contempt.<br/><br/>This movie was a loser in every way and not a indie movie. This thing was marketed to death."
"progmetal","1","299","510","20 February 2008"," there was something to like in this movie ???
","How original. A teenage girl who has the ""old soul"" vibe to her and for no explained reason has knowledge of '77 Punk though she was born in the '90's and her dimwitted blonde friend sure doesn't know who Richard Hell would be. This movie is almost a slap in the face to anyone who has a good set of morals. Her ""only"" options are to go to an abortion clinic or give the baby up to spoiled yuppies? The basically uninformed and shy Michael cera has basically no say in anything until all her options run out and then she ""decides"" that they must have been in love all along. And the comments she makes while getting her ultrasound are borderline offensive and her mom had no right to stick up for her daughters constantly talking and babbling mouth. The fact that ANY teenager would actually act and talk like Juno is a farce. She even keeps stopping by the adopters house unannounced and basically hitting (or flirting) with Jason Bateman who is supposed to be adopting this baby! And OF COURSE the parents are not only supportive but have plenty of wacky looks and one-liners themselves. The soundtrack is even worse then the crappy dialogue in this movie. I left this movie feeling insulted and the lack of 'moral' to this story is ????? That you try two different ways to ditch your own kid (who she always refers to as ""it"") and when nothing works you go to the original father and say ""lucky you""! Even the sex that took place was non-emotional and scary to think that high schoolers would just do it so casually like that. And why are people putting associating the word ""indie"" w/ this movie? It has major stars in it and looks pro. If I could of ripped my head from my body and thrown it at the screen in order to get this movie to stop I would have. Ellen Page deserves cut-out bargain bin for this movie not any awards. Her performance was of utter annoyance. Maybe the ""american pie"" movie crowd likes this but if you are a true lover of film....skip it!"

A great representation of stupid trivial empty references and buzz phrases that I am sure we will want to forget ever existed in the next year or so.<br/><br/>I saw it as less of a ""independent"" movie (or any sort of attempt at social commentary, character study, creative screen writing, etc) and more of a way for a company to make some money off the idiots who buy into laughing at jokes based on things that exist in the current culture.<br/><br/>HAHA she said something about how she eats ""Taco Bell"" or HAHA she drinks blue slushie drinks or HAHA orange tic-tacs or HAHA she mentioned ""blogs"". HAHA THATS SO FUNNY HOW CREATIVE OF YOU!

You ask why everyone in school is staring at you? Its because you are purposely making them stare at you by eating in the trophy case with your giant pregnant gut intentionally sticking out of that outfit next to your cliché ""mountain of food"" wrappers strewn all over yourself and said trophy case! As someone else said, the mentality of the screenwriter is that she not only owns a hamburger phone, but she WANTS everyone to know that she owns a hamburger phone! How can someone make such a desperate cry for attention but then shun everyone when they pay attention? It is all too forced and perfectly executed where I would ever believe that this was truly just a story written to warm people's hearts. This was just an example of how nowadays, everything is fair game for corporate rape; even hamburger phones and unknown-to-the-mainstream folk bands like the Moldy Peaches.<br/><br/>The public is buying into it, falling for it and just contributing to the further stupification and ignorance of everyone. It's a disgrace of a film and an insult to people who really work hard to CREATE THEIR OWN meaningful independent films. This writer just stole the ideas, subjects, personalities, words and lines from things created by people other than her so she can go buy a nice luxury house and live off the earnings fed by the sheep who hail this movie as brilliant.<br/><br/>You want to tell the already-rich vultures banking off this film how much you like to be controlled by them??

","Juno has an effect on you. You can tell by the opening title sequence that this movie has a lot of heart. The unique dialogue may come off as annoying to some but I find it to be one of the reasons the characters feel so real and likable. I felt as if Juno was a real person throughout the whole film, thanks to Ellen page. Her performance is perfect and there could not have been a better pick for the lead role. All of the casting choices are great. Including J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's Parents. Jason Reitman did his best directing in his career by far on this film, in my opinion of coarse. Diablo Cody's perfect script would have been ruined by any other director. But Reitman has an amazing control of tone. On a personal level Juno has left an impression on me and I will truly never forget it."
"levonpe","5","96","157","10 January 2008"," Competent, but boring
","I went into this movie with very high expectations as several friends had recommended it to me and it has an 8.4 rating on IMDb. Those expectations were not up to par with the movie itself, to say the least. You can cite various stylistic problems and inconsistencies in the story, but ultimately none of that matters. I just found it to be pointless. There isn't anything fatally wrong with the story or with the actors, it's just that I don't see what the interest is to begin with.<br/><br/>The story comes down to this: girl gets pregnant, girl puts child up for adoption, thinks it isn't going to work out at first, then it works out and she goes back to the father. Whoopdie freakin' do. Explain to me where in that boring list of events is there Oscar worthy material. Some of Juno's quips are mildly amusing, and the story progresses smoothly and with decent cinematography, but where is the overwhelming impetus of it all? What are we supposed to be inspired by? I must emphasize that I don't think this is a bad movie, I just don't think there's anything phenomenal about it - as many people would lead you to believe."
"sk8alypse","1","182","309","19 February 2008"," Overrated
","Having been recommended this movie by quite a few people, I had fairly lofty expectations for this movie. Boy was I highly disappointed. This movie was really boring, especially towards the end where I was practically falling asleep, and this wasn't due to a lack of sleep! The dialog in this movie is what makes it boring ... a pure sleeper! <br/><br/>The acting was average at best. Ellen Page's performance gets pretty annoying after about 10 minutes, further ruining the viewing experience.<br/><br/>Furthermore the movie was way too long. Perhaps if they shortened up the dialog and added some more action into it, it would have improved it.<br/><br/>In terms of novelty, there is none. The movies adds nothing to previous ones in the genre."
"Galcian","2","198","338","10 January 2008"," Another in a long line of College Kid Quote Fodder (tm)
","We've all done it. We've had that little moment where we think we're clever. We will jot down a poem, a short story or maybe even direct a super poignant student film and try to amaze everyone with our talents. After blowing smoke up our own butts for a while, most of us come back to earth fairly easily. Sometimes, we'll look back on these moments years later and say, ""Ah. My youth. How foolish I was back then.."" and enjoy a bit of nostalgia. Juno is what happens when that moment festers long enough to make it to the big screen.<br/><br/>In the first line of the movie, the titular Juno claims that it all started with a chair. I'm thinking it really started with a very pretentious writer named Brook Busey-Hunt (a woman who refers to herself as ""Diablo Cody"" and wrote a memoir when she was only 24, if you want an idea of just how pretentious she is) saying to herself, ""Tee hee! What a neat idea I've just had! A movie that ends with the same thing it begins with! I'm a genius!"" This is pretty much the feeling I got throughout the film; a movie constantly in awe of itself. A movie THINKING it's clever instead of actually making an honest attempt to BE clever. And, as with many films these days, it's designed to be College Kid Quote Fodder. As such, Juno has received much critical acclaim, and yet another bad example of how to make a movie is made. An example that will be copied and recycled to the point of obscenity. If you need proof, look no further than Juno itself, which feels largely derivative of films such as Napoleon Dynamite.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to point out anything good about this flick, as nearly every moment of it is so overflowing with arrogance and self indulgence that the finer details are scarcely visible. There were a few moments here and there that made me sort've laugh. Not an audible ""ha-ha"" laugh. Just that little inner laugh where you blow air through your nose once. Most of the dialog is very gimmicky and focuses on making young hipsters feel cool because they have knowledge of semi-current popular culture and the popular culture of yesteryear. Nearly every line is like something out of an episode of Robot Chicken, Venture Brothers or Family Guy, and the young, ignorant, ""edgy"" 20-somethings who are lauding this film as a masterpiece gorge themselves on that sort of thing. The ""THUNDERCATS ARE GO!"" line alone is going to ensure that Juno will be recorded in the annals of history amongst those who wear ""Vote for Pedro"" t-shirts and grown women who still wear those annoying, multi-colored striped socks with all the toes. And there are lot of you. I see you at the mall hanging out in front of HotTopic all the time. And man, Sweeny Todd and Juno at the same time? You guys must be having a liturgy.<br/><br/>See? I just did it right there. I was being a snide little jerk who thinks he's funny. But the difference here is that this is just a review soon to be flamed and forgotten, whereas Juno is currently ranked as the 129th greatest movie of all time at IMDb. That might not sound like a big deal, but bare in mind that this puts it above such films as The Gladiator, Annie Hall, The Deer Hunter, Life of Brian, The Princess Bride.. and, well, I don't even want to continue this list. It's too depressing.<br/><br/>The film isn't a total loss. There are some decent performances, at the very least. Most notably, we have Juno's parents, played by J.K. Simmons, who many will remember as Jamison from the Spiderman trilogy, and the West Wing's Allison Janney. Their characters were funny, sincere, and had the only worthwhile lines in the film. The would-be parents of Juno's unborn child, played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, are also played fairly well (though Garner definitely feels more than a bit out of place). The problem is that as convincing and adorable as these characters are, they're peripheral characters with very little to offer. As a matter of fact, the only character in this film who doesn't feel peripheral is Juno herself, played by Ellen Page. Page's performance is a tough one for me to slam because I can't quite tell if she's just wooden or if she's struggling with the awful, novelty dialog Brook Busey-Hunt wrote for her. The other characters aren't so much characters as they are caricatures, and also feel largely peripheral and derivative, even Juno's key love interest in the film.<br/><br/>In the end, Juno is just another film to provide young adults something to quote in front of their friends so they sound funny. But because the young people of this generation are so pertinacious and precious, Juno is adored by them and will probably go down in history as a masterpiece along with similar College Kid Quote Fodder movies like 300, Borat and Napoleon Dynamite. I was recommended this movie by a friend, and I was somewhat excited to see it after seeing all the raving in its wake. I won't say for certain that you should or shouldn't see this film. If you think shows like the Venture Brothers or Family Guy are the zenith of comic genius, you will love this movie, and by all means, go see it. If you're a bit less juvenile and have a taste for real comedy like the works of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks, Juno might leave you pretty confused and $8 bucks poorer to boot. Go see Walk Hard instead, while you still can. You'll at least get a good laugh, which is what comedy aims for, and something Juno fails at miserably."
"Buddy-51","8","301","524","9 January 2008"," from the art house to the megaplex
","The thing that separates ""Juno"" from so many other films about teen pregnancy is that, in this case, the 16-year-old who finds herself in that predicament refuses to become a victim of her circumstances. From the moment she confirms the unwelcome news, Juno studies her options - abortion, raising the child as a single teen parent, adoption - then takes matters into her own hands. Like the Roman goddess who is her namesake, Juno is a bright, often sharp-tongued individual who prides herself on her observant cynicism and her way with a sarcastic quip. However, she's not above appealing to the adults in her life when the problems of the world get to be too much for her (though, in some cases, the grownups are coping with more serious issues than she is). Yet, Juno makes certain that it is she and she alone who will have the final say when it comes to determining the course of her own future and that of her child.<br/><br/>""Juno"" is that rare low-budget, independent feature that finds unexpected success in the mainstream by striking a chord of recognition in audiences across the demographic spectrum. First-time screenwriter Diablo Cody hits pay dirt with a clear-eyed, largely unsentimental script that is not afraid to go off in unexpected and interesting directions and that avoids patronizing its Middle American characters. Juno's father and stepmother manage to take the news in stride, while the yuppie couple Juno alights on to be the child's adoptive parents are given a depth and complexity far beyond what a lesser writer might have afforded them. Director Jason Reitman keeps the quirkiness to a minimum and allows the scenes to play out in a naturalistic, unhurried way. Confident in the strength and appeal of his material, he lets the gentle human comedy speak for itself.<br/><br/>In a star-making turn, young Ellen Page takes a daring approach to her character, often bringing Juno right to the brink of un-likability, then pulling back at just the crucial moment, making us see how utterly likable she truly is. As the child's father, Michael Cera is virtually the same lovably passive nerd we found so endearing in ""Superbad,"" while J.K. Simmons and especially Allison Janney give rich shadings to Juno's supportive parents. Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner also make their mark as the couple who post their picture in the ""baby wanted"" section of the local throwaway.<br/><br/>""Juno"" faces the downside of any independent film that unexpectedly finds itself ripped from the confines of the art houses and suddenly duking it out at the multiplexes with all those high-budget, high-octane, testosterone-laden blockbusters - namely the risk of over-inflated expectations. Thus, my advice is to look beyond all the hype and box office records and simply let ""Juno"" sneak up on and take a hold of you in its own quiet, inimitable fashion. I think it works best that way."
"lfcfan0789","3","102","168","10 February 2008"," If you loved Superbad and Knocked Up... Ah screw it! The movie sucked.
","This weekend, my girlfriend drove down from Purdue visit me here at good old IU (she's transferring next year, thank God). Apparently, Purdue has some school-sanctioned P2P video sharing software that she recently got hold of. At a friend's suggestion, she downloaded Juno, and wanted to watch it with me. I personally thought the movie was a little too ""chick-flicky"" for me, but I absolutely LOVED Superbad (proud owner of the DVD, t-shirt, and theatrical poster), so I thought ""What the hell, it has Michael Cera, and it'll make my girl happy."" After watching the movie, I felt the need to watch Superbad again and make sure the same actor that was hysterical in that movie could possibly be the bland, unfunny male ""lead"" in Juno. Thankfully, I wasn't alone. My girlfriend shared my sentiments as well, so i didn't feel like a total a-hole.<br/><br/>First of all, I consider myself a bit of a music nerd (or Nazi, as my girlfriend suggests). I read in an internet headline somewhere a while ago that Cera showcases his musical talents in Juno and thought that was pretty cool. But I was wrong... dead wrong. The soundtrack in the movie made me want to bash my acoustic against my car so I could never accidentally play any chords reminiscent of the abomination to music I heard in that movie. Anyone who could listen to that ""music"" and say to themselves ""Hey, this is awesome"" is either: A. Under the age of 6. B. Have the mental capacity of a 6-year-old. C. Tripping on mushrooms D. Lying to himself/herself.<br/><br/>The movie itself was hardly amazing. All the characters were next to impossible to relate to. Cera's character, even though he was supposedly Page's character's best friend, was next to worthless when it came to plot development... If Juno was impregnated by some nameless father who is briefly mentioned, the movie would have changed very little. Her family is weakly developed, as well. Her half-sister is mentioned maybe 3 times, and shown even less. It would have been very interesting to see the dynamic relationship between pregnant older sister and innocent younger sister, but nothing is shown.<br/><br/>The adopting couple are the only interesting characters in the whole damn movie. I was way more interested in the back-story of these two, but nothing is given about Jennifer Garner's character and Jason Bateman's character is way more interesting than the few paragraphs of back-story we are given on him. I would have loved to see his transition from underground rocker to corporate sellout, but yet again I'm disappointed. Hell, if the entire movie revolved around these two and Juno was only a minor character, my review would probably be a lot different.<br/><br/>Enough with the pop-culture references already!!! There is a time and place for them, and that's usually in an animated comedy like Family Guy (love it!!!) or The Simpsons. ""Movies"" like Epic Movie, Date Movie, Scary Movie, and Meet the Spartans prove this time and time again. If it's longer than an hour, keep the references out of it. Superbad was hilarious, and the only reference I can think of is one about Orson Wells, which the target demographic would probably be clueless about.<br/><br/>The characters were so unbelievable it was sickening. Besides the young couple, there wasn't a single character I could look at and say ""That character totally reminds me of (fill in the blank)."" Juno tries to be too many personalities at once. One moment she's stupid and obnoxious, then she's sarcastic and nonchalant, and all of a sudden she's calm and rational. I can understand having a deep and complex main character, but when the character jumps from one extreme to the next in the same scene, it gets really tiring really fast. Cera's character Bleeker is so mundane and boring it's inconceivable how the two of them could be friends, aside from the fact that absolutely no one under the age of 45 would wear shorts like the track team that he runs for wears (in fact, i have no clue where someone would buy shorts like that).<br/><br/>I've seen that a lot of people were bitching about the film's ""pro-life"" agenda. While I think it's disgusting that someone could be mad about that, I thought the movie was totally indifferent to the subject. It made abortion protesters look like clueless morons with no support, while it made the clinics look like they're run by incompetent and unsympathetic jerks. While both of these are untrue in real life, and the movie is obviously attempting to satirize the two, the way the movie goes about it is so unfunny that most people don't even get the joke. In fact, the only reason I could find that Juno would walk out of the clinic is simply because the movie would be too short.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the movie is a let-down. It's obviously targeted to high-school and college girls and tries to make anyone who dislikes it feel like they're ""out of the loop."" It doesn't surprise me one bit that this thing was given an Oscar nomination. It's mostly because a comedy can't be funny if it wants to win Best Comedy, and Juno is definitely a prime candidate for that."
"Tony43","Null","98","161","20 December 2007"," the sum is less than its parts
","This is a well produced, well directed, well written and extremely well acted film. Its essentially a one woman show, and Ellen Page becomes a star with this picture, or at least she should.<br/><br/>So why am I not jumping on the bandwagon? Its a game played with a stacked deck and that turns out to be its downfall.<br/><br/>Juno is a 16 year old high school girl who gets pregnant after a single sexual encounter with her boyfriend of sorts, Paulie. Does Juno panic? Not on your life. Juno is smart as a whip, adventurous and once she decides to have the baby, she sets out on her own to find proper adoptive parts. The first family she visits turns out to be a rich yuppie couple who seem fine and they strike a deal. After a few doubts, Juno winds up having her baby and turns the child over to the rather rigid and somewhat frigid Jennifer Garner, who probably takes the kid right home and registers him for the right pre-school.<br/><br/>The problem with this whole thing is that Juno encounters virtually zero problems along the way. She is not kicked out of school or ostracized by her classmates, her parents are supportive, the boyfriend doesn't disappear on her and the adoptive couple, while facing their own problems, don't turn out to be too bad.<br/><br/>So essentially, what we have is the after school special about teen pregnancy, or one of a thousand Lifetime channel stories on the same topic, but minus most of the conflict. Its also minus what seems to me to be the real life emotion 16 year old girls would go through if this happened to them, and any of the self doubt that goes with the decision to give up their baby.<br/><br/>Lastly comes the question of whether any sixteen year old would be as self assured and well rounded as this girl? It's possible, but rare.<br/><br/>As such, the picture is worth seeing for Page's performance, but Juno is not exactly what you'd call high drama."
"orangeisthenewawesome","1","50","78","29 November 2008"," This movie is garbage
","Realize this movie was hyped to the wazoo for being wacky and offbeat. Actually, it's just garbage. The dialogue absolutely RUINS this movie. I realize it's a movie and is not necessarily expected to be realistic but it is so far from reality (and not in a good way) that it's just annoying. The character of Juno occasionally resembles a realistic teenager but most of the time is just a caricature of some type of person I have never seen or heard of in real life. The soundtrack blows. The whole movie is some pretentious attempt to be cool and artsy and instead just comes across as really silly.<br/><br/>The only person I found redeeming in this movie was Jason Bateman.

"zgringa","6","72","116","31 December 2007"," Is it worth all the hype?
","While I would admit that there were definitely a few laugh-out-loud moments in Diablo Cody's dialogue, there were a lot of inconsistencies with her characters. Is Juno being portrayed as a ""wise beyond her years"" 16 year-old, or are we supposed to understand that she is just your typical teen who acts on impulse without forethought of the consequences? She seems mature when she is faced with a very difficult situation (Mark coming on to her), and she handles it with ethics and aplomb. Yet somehow, she is so naïve that she never saw it coming in the first place (despite the warnings of her step-Mom). Heck, if she's smart enough to figure out how to deal calmly with this accidental pregnancy, why on earth didn't she use protection with Paulie in the first place? If she's supposed to be just a regular teen, then why have all the hip-quips and precocious attitude? And is it just me, or is it hard to see why Vanessa and Mark Loring are even still together when we first meet them? They couldn't be more different than Felix and Oscar, and yet The Odd Couple was entertaining because it was about comedy and conflict. The slow demise of a marriage is sadly real, but not entertaining.<br/><br/>Diablo Cody definitely has a talent for creating quirky characters with off-the-wall dialogue, but can she also create ones that are relatable? ""Juno"" had a ""Napoleon Dynamite"" feel to itinteresting to watch because the situation was real and possibly mundane, but the characters were so strange it was like watching aliens in human costumes. Juno's Dad is much more hip than any Dad I've ever met. Juno's step-Mom, except for her obsession with dogs, is way more cleverly sharp-tongued and protective of Juno than you normally see in a biological Mom. I'm guessing that Leah's taste in portly middle-aged teachers is meant as a joke; because it is so exaggerated it becomes farcical. I think the only character that even seems close to a real person is Paulie Bleeker. Don't misunderstand me; all the actors gave an outstanding performance. I just think that the media should hold off on crowning Diablo Cody the next Quentin Tarantino. She may be a professional when it comes to marketing and self-promotion, but she's not the only stripper out there who can writepandorazblog is better than Cody's P*ssy Ranch."

She simply cannot write dialogue. In this mess-of-a-film, the characters are indistinguishable because they all have the same snappy wit. Sure, the actress who played Juno (Ellen somebody) was absolutely tremendous. What was unclear was why the father--Justin Bateman--abruptly decided to leave his wife. To potentially hook up with Juno, who was somewhat of a younger physical version of his wife? And why was Juno's stepmom in the maternity room when the baby was being retrieved by the adoptive mother? Diablo, please stick to writing snappy, coming-of-age books."

First thing that really annoyed me about it was it lack of emotion that there was when Juno found out she was pregnant.

Yes its low budged but they could easily of searched Google for real life stories of pregnant teenagers.<br/><br/>Well that's one mistake but they didn't learn and yet again lack of emotion spoils things when she tells her parents.

You see hundreds of made for TV movies with the same story.<br/><br/>In a society where promiscuity, HIV & Aids, sexually transmitted disease and teenage pregnancy are prevalent, where large chunks of society are living in poverty or close too we are extolling the virtues and morals or lack thereof of Juno.

This is not what happens in real life Doesn't anyone see the problem this movie is going to cause with the teenage girls in the real world who are the same situation are facing, without a family to support them that Juno has in this movie, not to mention glamorising teenage pregnancy and promiscuity. I do not call this entertainment, its not funny, its distressing that humour can be found in such a subject.<br/><br/>OK, so this movie is also showing the plight of many couples whom have problems conceiving children and have to adopt and the emotions involved but really, making a comedy of such a serious subject.<br/><br/>Oh hang on, now I get it, this film would not have been such a hit had the writers not been on strike!!!"

If the movie universe was some sort of gigantic petting zoo, ""Juno"" would be the adorable little lamb standing in the corner making the jealous other lambs look like death incarnate. It's not a sugary sweet tale by any means, in fact it's a real down to earth kind of story that's not always pretty, but the approach to it couldn't be more right. It's humble, it's little, it's low-budget, and that's exactly what makes it so great. What I also liked about it, hell what I like about a lot of independent movies, is that it's never predictable. There is no formula, you don't know what's coming, you don't sit there quietly ticking of all the clichés: you just enjoy yourself tremendously. Finally, one last addition to the heap of praise and I swear I'll stop: it's been ages since I've seen an ending scene this beautiful. It's exactly the way you want it to be, and the camera zooming out at a barely noticeable speed is a brilliant touch. I quite liked ""Juno""."

Now that this self-censorship on a somewhat positively portrayed teen pregnancy has stretched it's vile claws to indie productions as well, we must fear that even with Hillary Clinton as president we'd have an abortion ban in less than 3 years. I've seen over 3200 films. Only in ONE a pregnant woman actually went through with the abortion: Holly Hunter in ""Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her (2000)"". And yes, this was of the ""You - think - you - can - have - an - abortion - just - like - that - but - you'll - be - sorry - in - the - end""-type. In ALL other films, they give the baby up for adoption, or keep it in the end (Sex in the City! I mean, WTF!?). This, is HIGHLY unrealistic, since American women do have abortions, like 10s of thousands per year. 100s?

There is a Canadian show that dealt realistically with teen pregnancy: Degrassi High, were a 14 year old girl got pregnant by a class mate, and in the end had the courage to tell her mother, so they decided that it was irresponsible to let her have it, so she had an abortion. But ... of course this episode was censored! Ny NBC.0 And of course... the girl had a mental breakdown!<br/><br/>A REAL refreshing, daring and new take on teen pregnancy would surely be, telling the sensitive, yet funny and touching story of the struggle of a 14 year old getting pregnant and her hilarious but yet heart-gripping search for an abortion clinic willing to perform a 20 week abortion. This search could take Ulyssesic dimensions, with sardonic comments by said 14 year old on parents, on school, on church, on clinics, on doctors and Jehovah Witnesses ... But yeah, guess which country would be TOO conservative for THAT .... I mean, if you can make light of the psychologically damaging experience of giving your kid away to TOTAL strangers, why not about the less psychologically damaging experience of abortion? I really, really, do think that the bond between mother and child after NINE months AND after giving birth to the kid, is far stronger than after 12 weeks or even 22 weeks (in which period it's not even viable) of pregnancy. So, the heartbreak of giving a real live kid away, must be GREATER than whatever guilt over an abortion.<br/><br/>This movie is Just So Wrong. On so many levels.<br/><br/>1/10 The Melancholic Alcoholic."
"riid","10","321","582","9 September 2007"," Notes from 2007 TIFF
","I saw this film at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival.<br/><br/>Juno MacGuff (played magnificently by TIFF regular Ellen Page), finds herself pregnant, knocked up by her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera) on their first attempt at sex. Juno, with the help of her best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby), takes it upon herself to find some adoptive parents. Courtesy of the local Penny Saver, she soon finds childless couple Mark and Vanessa (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner).<br/><br/>With the help of her surprisingly supportive father (J.K. Simmons) and stepmom (Allison Janney), Juno embarks on her pregnancy, which ends up affecting everyone in some unexpected and touching ways.<br/><br/>This was a great film, probably the best I've seen so far at the festival. Ellen Page gives a wonderful performance as Juno, convincingly portraying her as a real independent free spirit. Michael Cera was good and funny, although I occasionally had trouble divorcing his character from George-Michael Bluth. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney did a nice turn as Juno's parents. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman were great as the adoptive parents who, while seemingly the perfect suburban couple on the outside, have their own sets of issues on the inside. Bateman especially gave a great performance as Mark, who is worried about sacrificing his own dreams as he connects with Juno over a shared love of music and the reality of the baby sinks in.<br/><br/>This is director Jason Reitman's follow up to his first feature film, Thank You For Smoking, which also debuted at the festival on the exact same date and time in 2005. This is screenwriter Diablo Cody's first feature film, and she put together a refreshing take on the typical teen pregnancy story with some great dialogue for the actors. The audience laughed so hard at some of the lines, they drowned out the ones that followed."

","Full disclosure, I would probably see Ellen Page and Jason Bateman in anything, I love them both so much. Page is of course in the starring role here, and delivers an outstanding performance as the quirky Juno, a high school who finds herself pregnant after spontaneous sex with her nerdy friend (Michael Cera). The film is very well made, with clever dialog and composed of countless little moments that are amusing, despite dealing with a serious subject. Juno resolves to give the baby up for adoption to a yuppie couple played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner, but things get complicated with Bateman's character begins getting close to her because of their interests in rock music and slasher films, kindling long-standing desires on his part to do more in life before becoming a father.<br/><br/>This is a very well-cast movie from top to bottom. J.K. Simmons plays Juno's father who is generally kind and supportive, but expresses his disappointment by saying ""I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when"". Page's facial reaction, followed by her response, ""I don't really know what kind of girl I am"" is priceless, and just one of many great scenes for her. Allison Janney plays her step-mom, and has a powerful moment telling off the ultrasound technician while sticking up for Juno, and then later quipping ""doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream"". Cera plays awkward teenage dorkiness naturally, and Olivia Thirlby turns in a solid performance as Juno's friend.<br/><br/>This is a 'teenage film' that is smart, and has so many positive messages; it's accepting of unorthodox kids and difficult situations, which everyone deals with as Juno does, with humor and head up high. It's an empowering film, and a love story. The scene of Cera and Page strumming guitars and singing 'Anyone Else But You' (by The Moldy Peaches) is a sweet ending and caps off a nice alternative/indie soundtrack. Page really established herself with this film, and is well worthy of the Academy Award nomination she received."

","This is not a typical film review; there are plenty of those around here. This is more like an observation, after seeing Juno. It won't serve as well unless you have already seen the movie.<br/><br/>Juno represents what is the most deeply wrong in American culture since the sexual revolution. And I am decidedly not an uptight conservative, but one who has traveled the world and opened my mind to seeing what works and what doesn't. In regards to how we parent and how we treat women and motherhood, America has thrown out the baby with the bathwater. This film is a great example of how, not only for its content, but how our public has so warmly received it.<br/><br/>The good news (for a few): if you are a precocious and knocked up teenager or their self-absorbed parents, this film might help you to see things more positively about your situation.<br/><br/>The bad news (for most of you): if you are a fairly inexperienced and not knocked up teenager, this film will make you feel like you are really missing out on something.<br/><br/>Teenagers already struggle to understand the consequences of their actions, and this film is a BIG hit with teenage girls. It's socially irresponsible to paint such a reality about teenage pregnancy. <br/><br/>In fact, there have even been NEWS REPORTS about how more teenagers wish to become pregnant as a result of seeing this movie. Just like when kids watched Jackass and hurt themselves doing stupid things because their parents were absentee. I am sure some people would like to blame it on the kids; but shouldn't there be SOME level to which American film doesn't stoop any lower? Is nothing sacred at all?<br/><br/>Some things really just shouldn't be exploited for the sake of feeling good entertainment. I can guarantee you that whoever wrote his film has never suffered the loss of a child or endured the REAL stress that comes from being an unwed teenage mother. <br/><br/>This film is made by a bunch of limousine liberals who see the ironic beauty in every ugly detail and REALLY don't know when to say when. I'm not knocking liberals in general, just the ones who have never really had to work a day in their lives and find new and creative ways to waste their time on earth. To those, I extend my middle finger.<br/><br/>This is, hands down, the most socially irresponsible and dangerous film I have ever seen, made more dangerous by its very ""innocent, positive vibe"". It targets kids and families with a very wrong message; the very message young adults get by default when nobody explains a bit of reality to them. It makes me very angry. But more importantly, the fact that so many don't get why, makes me very sad."

","I didn't think that Juno was a very good movie.<br/><br/>GASP! <br/><br/>All I heard the first day back from break was how everyone absolutely LOVED Juno and how it is so groundbreaking blah, blah, blah. But I had some MAJOR problems with it and here they are from ""not as annoying"" to ""most irritating"" reasons: 4. The runners. Yeah, yeah, I know it is symbolism showing the repetitiveness of life and the dullness of the town in which the story takes place and breaking free of the day to day occurrences, etc. etc. But come on, they showed up about a billion times during the movie, and I knew whenever they did, there was going to be some sort of awkward conversation or far-fetched incident that for some reason the directors felt they needed to introduce with a group of short-short wearing teen boys. In addition, the chair symbolism also felt INCREDIBLY forced and didn't really make sense.<br/><br/>3. The relationship between Juno and Mark (the guy that was going to adopt her baby). I found it kind of gross and unnecessary. I guess it added some interest to the plot, but it seemed like they put it in just to add minutes to the movie. I would have liked to seen more of Rainn Wilson (the cashier guy), I think that that could have added a funny ongoing plot line/character relationship.<br/><br/>2. The ending. The movie had been building up to her having the baby and what was going to happen with it and how Michael Cera's character and Juno fell in love, but then they all of a sudden decide not to see the baby. She just kind of slipped that in there in the narration and it was REALLY unsatisfying. Also, the very end with them sitting on the curb playing guitar was very predictable and dull.<br/><br/>1. Most annoying of all, though, was the character from which the movie's title derives from and centers around. Juno, as a character, was SO annoying; I could hardly stand listening to her talk. The lines she said were so forced and unrealistic, it kind of took me back to the days of Gillmore Girls. Some of the things that she said were so unbelievable for a 17 year old to even think of, I just couldn't get into the character. I'm not saying that Ellen Page, the girl who played Juno did a bad job-- in fact she did a fantastic job actingit's just that the character of Juno was so bizarre and nonchalant about the pregnancy, I just couldn't believe that she could be a real person.<br/><br/>It was not all bad, though. There were some pluses to this film: 1.Michael Cera. He was totally cute and funny in a nerdy way, and said my favorite line in the whole movie: <br/><br/>Juno: ""'Cause you're, like, the coolest person I've ever met, and you don't even have to try, you know"" <br/><br/>Paulie Bleeker: ""I try really hard, actually."" <br/><br/>2. The soundtrack. It was fun and really controlled the whole feel of the film. Definitely a plus.<br/><br/>3. The acting overall. All of the characters were well cast, especially Juno's step mom and Paulie's mom. They were my favorite characters in the movie, and I loved the contrast between the two women.<br/><br/>4. Two words: Hamburger Phone <br/><br/>All in all, a mediocre movie at best,who's acting was the only thing that kept me from leaving the theater altogether. Some may agree, some may disagree, but that's just my opinion."
"grover-47","2","85","144","17 April 2008"," Yeah, right
","This is one VERY overrated movie, sorry. The extent of praise and showers of awards it received is mind-boggling. I apologize, but part of being a teenager is not always knowing what to say, not always being able to find the right words. Yet after 5 minutes it was painfully clear that Ellen Page would be playing the hyper-articulate card ala Gilmore Girls for the next 90 minutes. Who the hell talks like this? Perhaps the movie makers intended to highlight the character of Juno as some rarified teen exception-to-the-rule. Didn't buy it for a minute, sorry. Giant bogus hipster namedropping fantasy. Apparently Ellen Page already has another new movie out in which she portrays another precocious, acerbic teen. That means she gets just one more movie to do something else before I write her off completely (3 strikes). So she carefully recites calculated, manipulative dialogue (which I guess deserves one star). But so what? This is no slice-of-life realism, which ostensibly it is trying to be. In fact, it tries so hard that Jason Bateman, Rainn Wilson and Jennifer Garner are all uselessly cast in the shadow of its mass pretense."
"stefanbe","10","66","110","14 May 2008"," Despite the massive popular success that Juno has deservedly received, it is still a small film with a big message at heart.
","While the teen comedy genre has been littered with the fine works of directors like John Hughes and Paul Weitz, most entries are poorly written and acted affairs that fail to capture the world of teenagers. With Juno, director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody have managed to create a realistic portrayal of teenage life without being dreary or overly artsy. The intent of Juno is to tell the story of a sixteen-year-old girl who deals with a responsibility ""way beyond her maturity level"" and the people around her who care. The filmmakers succeed in not only creating the most realistic teenage comedy ever produced, but also in bringing characters who the audience trusts and knows. Juno is down-to-earth and grounded in reality, never over-the-top and intelligent enough to not rely on cheap gags to gain laughs. The naturalist feel of the actor's performances also gives the film a sense of being there with the characters as they charm the audience with their whimsy. Juno is bold and smart and is always entertaining and comfortable.<br/><br/>Juno McGuff (Ellen Page) has found out she is pregnant with the child of her on-again, off-again boyfriend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). After choosing against aborting the infant, she chooses to give it to a young couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). That's a gist of it, but what makes the simple plot so winning is the material provided to the ensemble cast, who works with some of the freshest dialogue ever afforded to a teenage film since Alexander Payne's Election. Diablo Cody does not rely on the quirky to make her screenplay succeed, because the characters feel so real and while the dialogue to some may seem odd, it is able to realistically show the vocabulary that teenagers speak every day to their peers. The subtlety of Jason Reitman's direction adds to the scope of reality by not over-doing it and allowing the characters to speak for themselves. Reitman is intelligent to not let the environment take over and he commands control of the production. Even the clothes worn by Juno and her friends reflect themselves. Juno's baggy trousers and loose clothings represent her independent and free mind as well as the gap between child and adult-hood. Paulie's running uniform signifies his attempts at running free like Juno, while Leah (Olivia Thirlby), Juno's best friend, tends more towards Uggs and other commercial clothes, showing how she attempts to blend in with the crowd rather than be herself. Even Mark Loring starts to evolve into more juvenile clothes as he gets closer to Juno. It is this attention to detail that makes Reitman's direction succeed with ease.<br/><br/>The performances from the ensemble all serve as excellent portraits of Diablo Cody's characters, managing to bring the right amount of warmth to each part. Ellen Page is the stand-out, shining in every scene and showing that there is a little bit of Juno in all of us. She has spunk, heart and plenty of humour making her one of the best written and acted young female roles to ever grace the screen. The chemistry with Michael Cera adds even more to the power of the character. Michael Cera is known mostly for playing meek, awkward characters, but in Juno, he goes even beyond his role as George Michael Bluth on the comedic masterwork Arrested Development. Cera plays Paulie with both strength and courage, making him a great companion for Juno and a scene where he confronts her is pure genius on the part of both Cera and Cody. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are equally as good, helping in making their character's conflicts and differences un-forced. As Mark evolved throughout the film, so does Bateman who develops the character in key with Cody's writing.<br/><br/>The only aspect of the film where Reitman and Cody depart from reality is actually a smart choice. Nowhere in the film is a character shown talking on a cellular telephone, the opposite of today's world where every single teenager appears to be talking into their hand. The absence of such a device expands on the theme of innocence that Juno displays. In an age where teenagers are trying to grow up too quickly, Juno is given the ultimate test of female adulthood by carrying an un-born child in her pouch. In yielding this responsibility and promising to give it to a loving couple, she grows as a character into realising that she is still a child herself and decides to wait a while before she grows up. The touching and poignant final scene, a guitar duet between Juno and Paulie, shows that she needs to hold onto her youth just a little longer before it disappears like track runners rushing to the finish line. Despite the massive popular success that Juno has deservedly received, it is still a small film with a big message at heart."

","OK, so after nearly two years of every now and again hearing how WONDERFUL and revolutionary this film was from my very baby loving teenage friends, I decided to sit down and watch it premier on the TV. Having heard that Juno delves into the issues of underage sex, adoption, teenage pregnancy and growing up, I was a little confused when it seemed that the point of the movie wasn't to educate kids on the need for protection, as I thought a movie based on such a sensitive subject would be, no the point of this film was to cram as much pop culture in an hour and a halves space and create some new trendy saying with the hope that in a week every kid out there will be quoting ""For shizz"" ""Yo yiggidy yo"" ""Wizard"" and friggin ""Home skillet"".<br/><br/>My main problem with this film is it's complete disregard for the seriousness of the subject it's based upon. Teenage pregnancy is a horrible issue and I personally have seen no less than seven girls drop out of high school to have a child, the pain and emotional trauma they went through, along with the bullying and often the exile they are forced into, lets not forget the anger they face by their parents, are all made light of with this film. This film has no depth, no compassion and no message for the people watching it besides, babies have fingernails.<br/><br/>Another problem is Juno only comes across as realizing that she is actually pregnant at one point in the entire film, and that seems accidental. The moment takes place when Juno is telling her father and step mother she is pregnant and Juno says the line ""I'm not ready to be a mum."" this is the only moment in the entire film, Juno seems to acknowledge what she is actually going through, Juno should be about to become a mother, but the fact that she is so quirky and into pop culture seems to make her strong and beyond maternal instinct and love from a mother to her child and enables her to walk around for the rest of the film with disregard for her unborn son, with the only evidence she is actually pregnant being her growing belly.<br/><br/>Most of the characters where unrealistic, annoying or plain weird for no obvious reason. The character of Juno is kind of like that girl everyone had in class, the one who was so anti mainstream and disapproving of anyone who liked something made by 'the man' plus her quirky one liners and ridiculous pop culture T shirts make her seem less and less like an actual human. Juno's best friend is a typical blonde, cheerleader, who for no explained reason has a thing for teachers, it would have added a bit of depth if the reason she has a thing for older men had been delved into, maybe she doesn't have a father figure or she is trying to run from a bad experience with a boy her own age, but no, the issue is simply left mentioned and never explained thus making a possibly traumatic problem a quirky little fact. Then Bleaker, some kid who seems to do nothing but run around in ridiculously short gold shorts, eat tic tacs constantly and is obsessed with Juno, going so far as to keep her underwear and lie on his bed holding it while looking at her year book picture, he has as much personality as a tooth pick and he lets himself be pushed around by everyone, his mother, Juno, the kids at school and when he finally tries to stick up for himself, Juno shuts him down by saying nearly on the verge of tears ""I'm a planet"" referring to her ever growing baby bump as if it is all his fault when she has confessed to planning the entire thing yet didn't bring a rubber to the occasion. Finally the potential adoptive father, the failed rock star, forced to sell out and compose jingles for advertisements for things such as deodorant and some type of food called Brunch, not only does this guy bail on his wife while they are in the process of adopting a baby because at nearly 40 he still wants to start a rock band and win a bunch of Grammy's, he gets a crush on the mother of the baby who is two years under the legal consent age in America, making him a dirty old guy border lining on would be pedophile, who was going to adopt the friggin baby.<br/><br/>The whole film is ridiculous, with facts mentioned and never explained, because explaining them would take away time for annoying one liners and stop the film being cute and might actually give it some depth. It was a waste of time and actually left me feeling rather angry, I hope very much that no girl watched this film and then decided when she was pregnant to give it up for adoption based on this film, because this film is so unrealistic, that girl will feel like a tone of bricks has hit her, where as with Juno, she avoids the bricks with the aide of quirkiness and pop culture simply pops our her child hands him over then gets with the father of the child and they play guitar and happy families, all over making this film is so unrealistic, I cant find words for it."

I had no idea what the movie was about; I only knew Michael Cera (Superbad, Arrested Development) was in it, which was enough incentive for me to go. <br/><br/>I walked out literally skipping alongside my best friend, both humming to the tune of the great original songs from the movie. The theme of love existing in so many forms where you least expect to find it just lifted me right out of my doldrums, and made me look at life again from a different perspective.

","Juno MacGuff is a sarcastic, cynical, tomboyish teen played by Ellen Page in a fantastic, perfectly tuned performance. After sort-of-spontaneous (but not really) sex with her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera of 'Superbad'), Juno receives an unwanted package--a pregnancy. Woops.<br/><br/>Juno decides to give her baby to an affluent couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). All seems well at first, but it will be a bumpy road until birth.<br/><br/>I can spend hours gushing about how terrific a movie 'Juno' is, but I'm not really the greatest writer on the planet, so I'll just express the fact that 'Juno' has a strange effect on you. After seeing it, I almost felt as if I would walk out of the theater and see Juno MacGuff just standing there, as if she were a regular living, breathing teenager. That's how good Page is. In fact, every single performance in the film is absolutely tremendous. I liked how Allison Janney's stepmom character isn't turned into a whiny she-demon like most formula stepmoms, instead, she's far more friendlier (if a little unsure of Juno's odd ways) than we would ever expect. And J.K. Simmons finally gets a role where he isn't a total jerk; instead, he's a sensitive father who truly cares for his wacky daughter.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is awesome, I'll be buying it as soon as possible. The wait for the DVD will be truly agonizing, but worth it in the end. We can see the chain reactions here when a group of truly ambitious individuals (such as Jason Reitman, Diablo Cody, and Ellen Page) get together and make a movie such as this. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it.<br/><br/>I give 'Juno' my highest recommendation possible. <br/><br/>Sweeeeet, man. 4/4"

","I was left irritated by Juno. Not only was the dialogue so forced and unrealistic, Ellen Page (Juno) came off as arrogant and ridiculously naive.<br/><br/>The story was just too easy- no angry parents after being told your (step)daughter is pregnant, no being picked on at school (apart from one occasion where Juno drops her books and gets slight harassment), and a completely indifferent love interest. It would have been slightly more interesting if we got more of an idea what emotions Juno and Bleeker were going through but we get none of this. Instead we see Juno breeze through her pregnancy, almost immediately finding new parents for the baby, with just one ""bump along the way"" as the tag line suggests.<br/><br/>As a teenager myself, I felt rather insulted by this film. It gave the impression that all teenagers are ignorant and naive, with little consideration of our actions.<br/><br/>If you want to see a film where an annoying 16 year old spews clichés and goes through a pretty uneventful pregnancy then you might like this, but not me.<br/><br/>By the way, who on earth says ""for shizz""??"
"Anirishmanstale","1","27","42","27 January 2009"," .....In Praise Of Being Uncool
","If you have been one of the unfortunates to have actually seen Juno, and hated it, (and come here sometimes as I do to relish in the negative reviews), you have probably read and heard just about every negative comment there is to offer by now concerning this horrendous movie. Rather than repeat the obvious flaws that so many others before me have picked up on, I thought I would offer a few new and original observations that seemed to have gone unnoticed, or unmentioned about this dreadful movie.<br/><br/>1. Many have taken offense at the blatant bad taste in making a seemingly jovial comedy about teen pregnancy. But I have failed to see anyone anywhere take notice of the small, but clearly defined subplot of Juno's best friend and her penchant for ""doing it"" with teachers. In case anyone hasn't been reading any headlines lately, teachers, coaches, aides and other folks we trust to educate and set a good example for our children ""poo tanging"" with underage students is at an all time high. Not exactly something to poke fun at. Yet it has seemed to go unnoticed in Juno's wealth of wretchedness.<br/><br/>2. We are supposed to find Juno funny, snappy, hip, and of course grow close and affectionate of her as the movie progresses. However, can anyone reading this actually feel they would sympathize, or care about a young woman that when first seeing her baby in the ultra sound says:.....""I can't believe there are saps that actually cry at this moment"". Oh God......(sniff), did that ever come to getting the old eyes welling here for a girl so sweet. (Enter: Extreme sarcasm).<br/><br/>3. I noticed that even some of the most critical of reviewers here couldn't help but praise the performance of Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner as the idiot adoptive parents. Try as I might to find something to like about this movie, I cannot give any credit at all to Bateman and Garner. Someone please tell me what they did to get any recognition. I just cannot see it.<br/><br/>4. Oh and speaking of Jason Bateman, why is it that when he up and tells Juno that he is leaving his wife, not a word is mentioned in criticism of why he went and took out a full blown ad, met with Juno, and set up the whole adoption if he was all that wishy washy and unhappy to begin with? Oh......Juno gets mad at him all right and throws a tantrum. But she never once says.....""Why did you set this whole thing up and promise me a set of parents if you weren't even happy?"" ""You stupid bastard."" Not a word is mentioned about that. Did anyone else besides me even notice that as rather strange? Pea brained Bateman later in the scene tells Vanessa that he never said"" he would be a good father"". Yet earlier in the interview scene Juno asks Mark if he is ready to be a father and he says he ""looks forward to coaching soccer and helping build volcano's for science projects"". Maybe it's me but that sounds to me like someone who is saying he will be a good father. I guess the director and everybody else involved in this rotten movie forgot to proofread the whole script. <br/><br/>5. To carry on with Jason Bateman and his running out on Jennifer Garner at the 11th hour, what about ""Vanessa's"" reaction to it all. She neither cried, screamed, carried on, slapped him, or did anything else emotionally substantial for a woman that just found out a month before a new baby is to enter her life that she is being divorced, and all at once an instant single mother. Please tell me ladies, is there any woman out there who's biggest reaction to such an event would be sitting down on their stairs and sighing?, as was Vanessa's reaction? She acted more like he had just informed her the sewer is backing up. In real life, or even in a real movie, Jason would have been awakened by a well aimed two by four across the head and dumped on the curb.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Juno is the latest, and by far the worst example of just how far one will reach to avoid not being called cool. The real irony here however is that this garbage of a movie that has become the poster child for cool, is in essence the most totally plastic movie I have ever seen. People love Juno for they can call themselves cool. They laugh at Juno to be cool, are brought to tears at the end of Juno to be cool, and tell everyone else who hates it that they do so for they are NOT cool. Being cool simply has to be the one common denominator in all favorable reviews of this movie for Juno can be literally eviscerated with flaws. The same caliber of Academy members that honored movies like ""Schindler's List"", and ""A Beautiful Mind"" cannot possibly consider Juno to be worth even showing up at the awards. But nowadays heaven forbid they, or anyone else be accused of being ""soooooo out of it"". Alas, I remember a happy time when the Academy of arts and sciences were proud, card carrying members of the ultimate institute of snobbery. They thrived in snubbing the cutesy pie, record setting ticket sale movies for whatever theatrical release they considered totally dashing, and debonair. I can actually remember hating them for that back in my early days of youth. Now I can only hope we see a return of it. Let me be the very first, the ""Norma Rae"" if you will of those that are willing to hold their head high and proclaim they are so very...... uncool. Ladies and Gentleman..... Juno sucked."

After deciding to not have an abortion, Juno decides that she will give the baby up for adoption to would-be parents Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) after finding an ad in the local classified section of the newspaper.<br/><br/>It may not sound like a deep film, but right from moment one, the film draws you into Juno's bizarre world of teenage angst and wonderment. It progresses through the stages of her pregnancy (and the seasons that pass), and through the various problems and issues that arise as a result of the pregnancy.<br/><br/>This is aided almost exclusively by the commanding presence of Page. Her work here is simply astounding, and watching her mature as the film goes on is the stuff of movie magic. She plays Juno with a chip on her shoulder, and a keen sense of tongue in cheek. She is very in tune with the role, and even though it is not wholly original, she makes it her own and gives it a grand sense of earnestness (and pathos when needed). She plays it even better during the more hormonal aspects of the pregnancy, and she makes her undeniable mark on the movie-going public as she does. After seeing her intense, calculating and downright terrifying work in Hard Candy, I knew that she would be a presence to be reckoned with. And in seeing Juno, I now know that she truly will continue to grow into a great actress.<br/><br/>Supporting turns from just about everyone only further complement Page's terrific acting. Garner and Bateman, while not as well written as Page, do great as the would-be adoptive parents. While Bateman taps into his not so over-the-top side (which he used to his great advantage in scene-stealing roles in Smokin' Aces and The Ex), and gives a great character performance, Garner does even better as the over-domineering wife. She gives the role a slightly creepy tinge in a few cases, but for the most part, delivers one of her best performances. While not as commanding as he was in Superbad, Michael Cera, as the father of Juno's baby, gives his character a glossy sense of naivety as the film begins, but slowly falls into a grander sense of geeky goodness as the film goes on. His shy teenage chemistry with Page is astounding, and helps give the film its greatest moments of heartfelt drama. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney round out the cast, lending the film some of its deeply funny and dramatic moments as Juno's parents, and relative newcomer Olivia Thirlby does very well as Juno's best friend.<br/><br/>But for how great the cast was, what I was really anticipating was the screenplay, by current sensation Diablo Cody. I was a little apprehensive at wanting to jump on the bandwagon of praising her, but the script is truly wonderful. While the start of the film feels a little forced with its witty and sarcastic banter, the film gradually progresses into a very fair balance of hilarity and drama. Its gradual depth does not go unnoticed, and as the film packs into its most dramatic scenes, it really becomes apparent that Cody has a great sense of how to write really well. First time screenwriters (or even screen writing hopefuls) can take notes in how well expressed the wording is here (and how obscure pop culture references can still be funny), and just how greatly written the film is. When dialogue comes so natural to some of these characters, it becomes very obvious that the writer knows what they are doing. If she keeps up like this, than I think she could truly be the prodigy that everyone is making her out to be (although Jennifer's Body really does not sound like a step in the right direction).<br/><br/>I think what only slows the film down is the near forced relationship between Page and Bateman that grows as the film goes on. I understand its importance to the film and understand why it is here, but I just think they play it a little too loosely and way too longish to make it feel as worthwhile as it needs to be. The two work off of each other well, yes (although not nearly as well as Page and Cera, or even Bateman and Garner), but the dialogue and scenes between them just sound like an afterthought, and do not seem in sync with the rest of the film. They have the humour, they have the references (maybe a few too many), but they just do not jive nearly as solidly as they should. Maybe a little less focus on these scenes, and more with the likes of Cera (who is not underused, but probably could have been used a bit more) or Simmons or Thrilby (who are not used nearly enough) could have helped make the movie even better than it already is.<br/><br/>Juno is not perfect, but it is heartwarming and bittersweet all the same. I laughed and almost got choked up by how exquisitely written and how superbly acted the film was. Page is marvellous in the lead role, and Cody just might be on the right path to be true greatness. If only all small Indies could be nearly as memorable or nearly as astonishing as this one is. An obvious candidate for being one of the best (and funniest) films of the year.<br/><br/>9/10."
"tyrone-jones","6","77","147","13 January 2008"," Pretentious unrealistic dialogue belies a sweet little love story
","First and foremost, i DID like this movie. It was a sweet little love story and by the tale's end we see a happy ending for the title character and her baby daddy. The problem i had was with Juno herself... or perhaps with the script. While i won't lie and say i NEVER laughed during the film, i feel like i did a lot more eye rolling at some of Juno's dialogue.<br/><br/>Juno's dialogue was rife with pop culture references, name dropping and too much heavy handed sarcasm. To hear and see it performed, it didn't come off as naturalistic or believable to the plot, it just came off that Diablo Cody (screenplay's scribe) really wanted to impress people with her database of obscure minutia. Its almost as if she knew her target audience was teens and critics and she married her targeting to both demographics.<br/><br/>the other issue i had with this movie was with Juno's over the top immunity to life's ire. Having been through two pregnancies with my wife, i know even in the best circumstances one cannot keep up the ridiculous front that Juno did in this film. At some point reality sets in, emotions kick in and you feel... something. This didn't happen with Juno. She is the smartest character in the entire movie. Diablo Cody has made her very own Mary Sue in Juno. the little girl she wishes she could have been. Juno will not likely grow up to strip or do phone sex.<br/><br/>Fans will defend and say ""Well Juno is just a genius girl who interacts in this environment and this is how such a unique girl handles the situation"" or as i call it the 'Max Fischer Defense' but sadly with snarky lines like ""They make his junk smell like pie"" ""that ain't no etch-a-sketch home skillet"" et al that argument falls apart. EVERYONE inhabiting Juno's world talk like Kevin Smith script rejects constantly reading off of pre-written pages.<br/><br/>Film Critic (fans) love the heavy handed pretentious dialogue because ""Hey i have seen that movie, i know the actors to which Juno references and its so witty"" and teens love it because Cody has created a too-cool-for-school character they all want to be. ""OMG she is JUST LIKE ME AND MY FRIENDS-- LOL"" I did like the film, a sweet little love story finds its way through the Jungle that is an overworked unrealistic script."
"sbyersmarriot","2","264","545","17 December 2007"," We need to take another long hard look at why this movie doesn't work...at all.
","The buzz on JUNO is an example of herd-mentality, the exact kind of mentality that writer Diablo Cody is supposed to represent an alternative to, but doesn't, at all. <br/><br/>Juno is a cultural touchstone, but not because it's any good  it's because perhaps more than any other film to date, it represents that alternative has gone mainstream. Next step - VH1's ""What ever happened to..."" special. <br/><br/>The ""fierce wit"" of the dialog in Juno is only a marginal step above a Gilmore Girls episode, and because of its marginal betterness, it's ten times less likely to come out of the mouths of any of the characters that speak it. <br/><br/>A 16-year old making an easy-breezy ""thundercats"" reference? Are you kidding me? There's no way Ellen Page's character would know about the show let alone have any sort of affinity for it. A dude at the drug store speaking in prosaic rhyming urban prose? Diddle...undone...home skillet? <br/><br/>The only reason the dialog flies is because its ""cute,"" and ""sharp,"" but ""real,"" ""honest,"" and ""authentic,"" could never be applied. Without these touchstones, it's all pantomime, an elevated form of speech that may be funny now because it feels contemporary, but will surly date itself before you can say Jun...<br/><br/>What's worse, because everyone speaks this way, its clear that all the characters are written by exactly the same person. <br/><br/>If you really look at it, the writer never puts herself in the shoes of anyone other than herself. She can't relate to these characters, so she sells them out by ""elevating"" what they actually might say to a level that is unintentionally detached, overly-ironic and in no way sincere.<br/><br/>Just as over-sized shoes and a goofy hat don't necessarily make you funny, snappy comments and overripe dialog don't necessarily make you witty. If anything, I would argue they often produce the opposite effect. <br/><br/>Clowns freak me out. So does this movie. There's something evil about it. I feel like it represents closet socio-pathology - its moments that work all stem from Cody's inability to empathize, rather than her ability to. <br/><br/>I'm upset to see so many people earnestly routing for a movie that doesn't know the first thing about earnestness. Let's think for ourselves and stop supporting a film and writer that can't seem to feel for anyone."
"rrzamudio","1","17","27","12 March 2012"," As fake as fake gets.
","Think of Napoleon Dynamite trying to tackle real-life issues, and you have Juno in a nutshell. Deadpan humor and awkwardness ahoy.<br/><br/>Nothing in this film comes close to being real, even though there is supposed to be some real-life message embedded deep within. Everything from the 16 year-old lead character's 40 year-old ultra-cool demeanor and snappy wit, to the blah reaction of the parents over a teenage pregnancy, to the BS fairytale of finding a perfect adoption family so easily. All crap that will surely misguide younger viewers.<br/><br/>The message I got from this film is:<br/><br/>1) Casual sex as a teenager is no big deal, because there is always a safety net there to save you. Whether it be your parents, your school, a public aid program, or, in this case, a rich couple who is just more than willing to help you out of a tough situation.<br/><br/>2) The adoption vs. abortion issue. I'm not going to go there since the director already did.<br/><br/>3) There are no consequences for even the stupidest of mistakes caused by the most careless behavior, so don't take anything too seriously. You can get pregnant, act like it is a minor inconvenience that will supply you with some entertaining moments for the next 9 months, and then you can give the baby up for adoption and go pack to playing guitar with your garage-band boyfriend as if nothing ever happened.<br/><br/>4) The father-to-be has no choice in the matter and should just go on with life as usual.<br/><br/>The only real issue that was presented in any believable fashion is with the adopting couple. <br/><br/>Perhaps if this film were passed-off as a feel-good film, or the like, I could let it slide. You can't really make a light comedy film that includes such controversial issues like teen sex and the real-life choices presented over a teen pregnancy. This film tries to side-step the realities of the issues with witty dialog and ignorance. It is as fake as fake gets.<br/><br/>Because of this film, an Academy Award win or nomination will no longer sway my decision to see or not see other films in the future. It is clear that the honor is merely a watered-down title that comes from an organization whose standards have fallen into the toilet. Don't believe the hype!"
"ismaelslgd","9","5","6","1 August 2018"," My Favorite Indie Movie
","After the credits rolled, Juno had me asking myself the question I don't ask too often, ""why did I wait so long to watch this movie?"" It is heartwarming, witty, original and unpredictable in all the right ways. The film broke many of my stereotypes about an unwanted pregnancy and all the attitudes that surround it. It was as if Diablo Cody knew my assumptions on what was going to happen or how a character would react to a situation, and then turned my assumption upside down in a satisfying and thought provoking way. This was achieved through the depth of each of the characters, and how my opinions on many of the characters changed throughout the film. While Cody plays with our assumptions on certain characters, Juno herself is pure gold from the first scene. Ellen Page does an incredible job in the lead role, taking Juno's character and witty banter in stride and holding the film together very well. The supporting characters are all memorable in their own way, and most of them win you over by the time the film is over. Props to the filmmakers and actors for really challenging and exceeding our expectations. This is easily the best independent film I have had the pleasure to watch."
"Raven-1969","8","5","6","2 December 2017"," Snarky Serious!
","When Juno, a single and pregnant teenager, announces that she is ""losing faith in humanity,"" her long-suffering father asks if she can narrow it down a little. This scene, as serious and poignant as it is funny and charming, provides a glimpse of the tone and tenor of the film throughout. Everyone, even a convenience store clerk, has something snarky to say. Tense situations are disarmed by humor and sympathy.<br/><br/>Juno is obviously not ready to be a mother, yet she handles her situation with inherent panache and a curious blend of independence, optimism, sarcasm and diligence. In searching for a well-off and decent couple who will provide a good home for her baby, Juno displays more maturity than most adults. The childish antics of her elders and the serious nature of her situation cause Juno to do some serious soul searching along with attempting to discover someone who loves her for who she really is.<br/><br/>Ten years after the release of Juno and it is still original, cute and exceedingly snarky. The untraditional plot and dialogue are refreshing. Ellen Page (Juno) carries not only a baby, but the film as well. She is a natural for such a role and perfectly cast. Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons are wonderful in their supporting roles. I wonder how much their future success depended on their roles here? Depth and nuance (beyond being snarky), however, are lacking. There should be plain English subtitles for the language of other generations, young and old (ha, ha)! Maybe the wait is another ten years for such an app."

","I saw this movie and was really looking forward to it, because I liked the director's last offering, ""Thank You For Smoking"". I was completely knocked off of my feet! The humor was completely entertaining and didn't dwindle into a perverted cuss fest like some other comedy offerings of late (Superbad). The actors did a tremendous job - J.K. Simmons (no longer will he just be remembered for Spiderman), Ellen Page was incredible (finally a movie to like her in - Hard Candy was just too creepy, sorry), and Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner are paired up once again (also paired in The Kingdom) and play the embattled parents to be of this new child while facing their own demons in their struggling marriage. The movie was just very real, and also gives anyone hope that good things can come out of seemingly bad and insurmountable odds. Go and see this film!"

","Seen at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>I have discovered my 5""1, 20 year old cinematic muse, and her name is Ellen Page.<br/><br/>I was one of the lucky patrons of this year's Toronto Film Festival to have stumbled upon one of the very best films of this year: JUNO, a breathtakingly hilarious and heart-breaking black-comedy directed by the uber-talented Jason Reitman and written by Diablo Cody, a former stripper and first time screenwriter.<br/><br/>But the real praise here goes to Page, who (as quoted here by Reitman) ""can go from hilarious to heartbreaking in seconds flat."" To me, her talent truly lies in the way she brings a careful sensitivity and intelligence to all her roles. Here Page is Juno McGuff, a sarcastic and wise beyond her years 16-year-old dealing with the complexities of an unplanned pregnancy.<br/><br/>Reitman directs here with the same knack for visual charm we saw in ""Thank You For Smoking"" and elicits tremendous comic performances from the entire supporting cast, including Allison Janney as Juno's tough-talking step-mother (who has an unforgettable scene with an ""ultrasound technician""), Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner as the adoptive parents of Juno's baby and fellow ""Arrested Development"" alum and newly minted ""Superbad"" star Michael Cera as Juno's high school track star love interest.<br/><br/>Come release in mid-December (a.k.a award season), I sincerely believe this well-crafted piece of genius will garner the audience it deserves."
"Turfseer","3","29","52","23 February 2008"," For lovers of Oprah
","Those who love Oprah will probably love this movie along with aficionados of daytime soap operas. The strategy of such movies is to give the characters a few quirks but make sure they all have hearts of gold. Juno is full of witty quips (improbable for most 16 year olds) and her boyfriend Bleeker loves tic-tacs (that's about all we found out about him throughout the entire movie). <br/><br/>Juno's parents blandly accept her pregnancy and they have nothing much to do except wheel her into the maternity ward when she's about to give birth (funny how the father disappears for most of the movie--he's nothing more than a kind-hearted cheerleader for his daughter when we do get to see him). <br/><br/>The screenwriter, Diablo Cody, takes a stab at creating an antagonist in the character of Mark Loring, who decides to divorce his wife and foil Juno's plans of having the couple adopt her baby. But even though he decides to leave, he's also still a good guy--albeit a person who simply needs to ""find himself"". <br/><br/>Ultimately ""Juno"" doesn't have enough conflict to keep one's attention for a full hour and a half. Cody falls back on predictable, saccharine moments to fill the void. Did I forget to mention Jennifer Garner? Her 'Vanessa' is probably the dullest of all the characters in the movie. <br/><br/>Many on this board who gave the film a low rating fault it for trivializing teen pregnancy. That might be true but the worse failing is the lack of character development coupled with a predictable and sentimental denouement."
"jem132","3","19","32","1 November 2008"," Don't waste your time
","This wasn't worth watching, and I had that feeling after I saw a trailer for it while I was in the cinema waiting for ""Atonement"" (that film should not be mentioned on the same page as this one). I got it out from my Uni library, so at least it didn't cost me money. It's not all bad, Jennifer Garner's performance as the woman desperate for a child is very touching, but the rest of the film is so obnoxious and pretentious that I just want to kick it.<br/><br/>For starters, how is Juno a ""whip-smart"" teen as the fawning movie critics had it? OK, she has a hamburger phone and listens to indie music. Wow, so original. She certainly wasn't smart enough to use protection during sex, so how could she possibly be surprised to find herself pregnant? It's not Ellen Page's fault, she is quite good in the role, but the terrible writing. Then again, what can you expect when it's written by a former stripper who re-named herself ""Diablo Cody""?<br/><br/>The ""teen-speak"" dialogue that was much talked about on release is just rubbish writing. No-one in the role world speaks or acts like the characters presented here, save the adoptive parents. The whole thing just left a foul taste in my mouth. Juno has the baby, gives it up, and then happily goes back to strumming her guitar like nothing happened? Is that growing up and facing life's problems? <br/><br/>In short, no. And that's what the theme of the film wanted to be about, and it miserably failed. I'm not usually so negative in my comments but I just can't believe how adored this film was by the critics, and Miss Cody got an Oscar for writing? Best Original Screenplay? The same Award that Casablanca won in 1942? Huh?"

"TheTwistedLiver","1","127","264","6 December 2007"," a marketing ploy
","Sadly after the success of such films as ""Napolean Dynamite"" and ""little Miss Sunshine"" the studios are attempting to market ""Indie"" as a brand. Those in Hollywood aren't stupid, they know that the less money they have to spend on a film in production the higher the profits if it pays off, however, what makes films great or charming that are small is that they aren't contrived to make 100 million dollars. The studios are attempting to bottle cuteness or preciousness, pass it off as original because a character drinks sunny d or chews orange tic tacs or watch out! has a hamburger phone! in order to fool the masses into believing that they are watching something fresh and original and those that disagree ""just don't get it"" or are ""haters"" however, the problem is not that people ""don't get it"", its that some people ""do get it"" and can see through this attempt at marketing a Twinkie like its moms homemade Apple pie. The entire film is so wrought with verbal prestidigitation that if anything resembling a true film were in there it was buried beneath cunning linguistic masturbation.<br/><br/>Juno is the first movie of this kind, that is being marketed prior to wide release as a cult film. Shouldn't it be around for a bit before it's deemed cult or at least get a wide release into theaters? This insidious marketing ploy is an evolution of commercial advertising which is beginning to penetrate all forms of art and media and as long as people keep spending money and falling for this drivel they will continue to churn out plastic pictures under the illusion of art.<br/><br/>This film wanted so badly to be something special yet the over written dialog and quirks stamped on the characters ruined what could have been a good story. Everyone tried too hard on this picture from the writer, director, to Fox Searchlight who has already stamped ""One doodle that can't be undid"" on t-shirts in an obvious and obnoxious attempt at creating dialog that will be echoed and reverberating in the high school halls of America like the latest Justin Timberlake album, who knows, maybe it will work, however I doubt something as saccharine as this will gain a cult audience but I was wrong with ""Garden State"" ""Napolean Dynamite"" ""Little Miss Sunshine"" to name a few, never underestimate the stupidity of the American public."

I fully understand the teen angst angle, but since the beginning of time, couples have had to deal with this subject manner. I could deal with Juno's mind set that she wanted to give up the baby in order for the baby to have a better life, but then for Juno to go back to Bleeker and act as if nothing happens? Bleeker would be a great example for all boys or men for that matter who will never pay one penny in child support? I know let us have Juno the Return of Bleeker which allow him to get two girls knocked up so he can run a few more laps while allowing the girls to figure out what to do?????

This contains spoilers but oh my, I wouldn't know what to spoil.<br/><br/>Ellen Page manages to annoy in the first minutes of the film, a little know-it-all twerp with improbable snappy one liners her only way of communicating. Somewhat helping is the oh-so-cute Cera, but this character is so clearly copied from Napoleon Dynamite and Superbad, it's trite. Page really looks more like 13 than 16 - pregnant, while almost a toddler herself. But in her world everybody at once thinks she should be treated like a responsible adult, while on the other hand not holding her responsible because of her age. Well if that isn't some dreamy lala land. Everything works out for her of course. Seemingly she is running into trouble because the adoptive parents break up. Crying because she wants her little son to have an intact family, this seems to be her biggest struggle. But without further ado, the foster mom still takes the baby (I guess the contract was binding), and Page decides she loves Cera and they play the guitar together. Let's see: Tiny teen gets pregnant. Nothing wrong with that. While a premeditated act, as is confirmed about three times in the movie, Page doesn't think of using a condom. Why? She gets off the hook (doesn't even look at the baby) by finding adoptive parents. Worst case she could always give it to Jolie.<br/><br/>The kid gets to live with a single mom, but she has money and it's not Page so nothing to think about.<br/><br/>Much more important according to the movie is for Page to be in a happy relationship, as otherwise she might run out of time, being 13 already (I mean 16).<br/><br/>Cutie little indie music suggesting everything is dandy.<br/><br/>Not much of a story, ridiculous dialog, very dubious messages.<br/><br/>But you won't notice any of this, because the movie is boring as hell.<br/><br/>Putting in some good words about smoking (that was actually a good satire), Reitman feels the need to promote kiddie pregnancy. I kind of pity Diablo Cody, as the script reveals sociopathic tendencies. But what drove Reitman to implement this 'vision' I don't even want to know.<br/><br/>What age is the audience supposed to be? Thirteen? Most kids we saw at the movie seemed to be that age. Whatever middle aged critics find to recommend for adults is beyond me. Actually kids should be protected from this movie.<br/><br/>Oh final warning: don't discuss the movie with your girlfriend. While the enormity of the sickness of this movie may sink into her slowly, she will initially be too prejudiced towards womanhood in the form of the script writer, the main actor, and the compassion towards unwanted pregnancy to realize what the hell she just watched."
"tedg","Null","21","37","21 January 2008"," Baby Formula
","Okay, we've had some experiments by risktakers, and now its clear what this new formula is. This movie is effective because it understands what that formula is, what it has to do and then does it with precision.<br/><br/>The formula is to take adolescent vulnerability, define it away from the normal high school stereotypes, and exploit it with coolness depicted lightly. So what you do is discard one of the two primary urges of youth (to belong) and emphasize the other, to be cool (to which others want to belong). Being cool is a token standing for being genuine and true. You are therefore endearing and what weaker teens aspire to be.<br/><br/>All of us are essentially teens (or pretending not to be), so this dynamic plays on the attractiveness of the character. Its a simple formula, rendered here by very clear writing devices. Its important that the boyfriend be uncool, with his only distinguishing attribute that he was picked by the girl. This is done by the usual means; he's a skinny dweeb and acknowledged by everyone as such. But he's also a member of the recurring nameless group of runners, a chorus all undistinguished in their appearance and behavior. <br/><br/>There are writing tricks as well. When we first meet him, she thinks his running shorts are ""more gold"" than the others. There are three important occurrences where he is conflated with furniture, and the metaphor is made stronger by our heroine thinking about assuming the same role. These are so prominent, that I suspect they were the first things imagined.<br/><br/>A key scene has her teetering on the edge of seducing an older man, the husband of the couple designated to receive her baby. What she's done is place herself in the way so that he can seduce her. Its something that we sense as subtle in the movement toward the seduction, when she backs out. He asks why she's there if not for this, and she avers that she ""wanted to be a piece of furniture in his life."" This is careful writing, very tightly braided.<br/><br/>Of course we aren't meant to see any of this structure because the idea is to fall in love with this girl as exemplar of a personality attractor, and a catalog of desirable traits. She is given some wonderful lines, and directed to deliver them with precisely the type of natural confidence the role requires. Not the role in the movie, but the role such people play in our lives. It helps that she is slight, lesbian (in real life) and confident.<br/><br/>Other writerly devices...<br/><br/>The ""adult"" couple who will become adoptive parents turn out to be a sort of mirror: a strong woman (with flaws our teen doesn't have) who clearly has picked her male the same way Juno has. He's literally furniture as well, stays home. Has his own room. He is not whole person, and indeed is one of the followers instead of an leader in this social business of who defines who. He leaves the scene to find himself after we learn that is even attracted to Juno.<br/><br/>The whole thing is designed as an abstraction. Well, most of these movies are, but this is all affirmed through the credits when we see not a real film of our character walking (after introducing us to her chair), but a semicartoon. Its a cartoon world, with a semireal Juno walking through it. Those first few minutes of a movie are when we are particularly sensitive to cues about the nature of what we are to see. The visual unreality segues to an encounter with a convenience store clerk that affirms, yes, we are to see a semifantasy here that plays with roles. The music underscores the sketchy cartoon motif by being all overtly handmade.<br/><br/>Once in the thing, we are surrounded with the need to define ourselves by others, with a focus on children. Her mother is defined in 20 seconds in terms of her three new babies. Her stepmom (who has a new baby: ""Liberty Bell"") is defined in terms of the pseudobabies she still wants. There's the Jennifer Garner character. Its even in little things, like the Manga comic designed for boys of a kickass pregnant teen. <br/><br/>Its significant that except for a teary moment near the end, Juno doesn't need a baby to be cool. And we end lingering with a view of that innocent, natural strength, as she goes back to her chair.<br/><br/>Good writing.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","Okay, the acting is good. It's worth seeing only for Alison Janney and JK Simmons' performance as Juno's parents and even the usually dull Jennifer Garner shines, but where Juno fails is that the subject matter is treated very lightly and the character Juno herself takes her predicament far to lightly and finds a solution to her 'problem' extremely easily and without much emotion at all. The script is horrible, peppered with words like ""Dude"" and ""like, totally, whatever'. Juno is supposedly so intelligent and yet speaks like a twelve year old and yet wasn't mature enough to have protected sex? Huge plot hole, Miss Cody!!! Diablo Cody did NOT deserve her Oscar.

","The mark of a wonderful film or novel is it's ability to take an ordinary story or situation and transform it into something remarkable and touching. Similarly, ""Juno"" attempts to take the increasingly common event of teenage pregnancy and weave a cutesy little spiel around the whole shemozzle.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it doesn't quite get there. Ellen Page displays a mountain of talent, but frankly her character's constant sarcasm, schoolyard-slang, not to mention the attention-seeking ""individualism"" are quite irritating. Of course the kid's heart is in the right place but who does she think she is? Do we care? The script is razor-sharp and riddled with witty one-liners but it's a little hard to justify a feature-length film on dialogue that may have been better suited to a comic strip.<br/><br/>Add to this some very misguided messages about sex, love and marriage, and a jumble of 1-dimensional characters (Michael Cera: the sweet dork you do so well is getting old) and you have a movie that is vaguely entertaining but ultimately unsatisfying."
"zetes","5","53","107","1 January 2008"," Too cutesy by half
","When I saw the trailer for this film, what seems now like seven months ago now, I cringed. It came off as if the screenwriter was screaming ""Aren't I quirky? Yay!"" I was hoping, even praying, after the hugely positive reviews hit the street, that the trailer was just trying to sell it as a quirky indie flick, and that it was really just a heck of a lot better than that trailer, which, by the time it opened in the Twin Cities, whence screenwriter Diablo Cody hails, I had seen about a thousand times. Alas, no. Not only is it as bad as the trailer made it look, the trailer shows bits from just about every sequence in the film. It doesn't give away one of the movie's big twists, but it does give away about 75% of the jokes. What's truly pathetic is that only about one out of five jokes were funny anyway. And I wasn't the only one who thought so. The theater was packed (Twin Cities residents can't help but flock to any movie that even mentions the state of Minnesota, and the audience got excited at mere references to St. Cloud, Stillwater and Mankato), but not once did the audience collectively find anything uproarious. You'd hear some laughs at most of the jokes, but it was never everybody, and it was only ever sporadic. And the film had its fair share of gags that completely bombed, the audience entirely silent. The plot is incredibly shallow, and completely uninsightful about the issue of teenage pregnancy. Apparently, it's only a condition that requires belabored dialogue and a constant barrage of twee-pop songs to make it out okay. To make it worse, a large portion of the audience was made up of teenage girls. Between this and Britney Spears' sister, I predict teen pregnancy to be all the rage in 2008! Seriously, the whole film sometimes comes off as Diablo Cody making an embarrassing scramble to prove her indie cred. The Stooges! Dario Argento! Belle & Sebastian (okay, I love Belle & Sebastian, too, so sue me). For the most part, the characters are two-dimensional and come off as disconnected from any recognizable reality. For an instance, would an ultrasound technician express her satisfaction that a teen will not be raising the baby so audibly? Would the receptionist at Planned Parenthood treat a patient so cavalierly? The only characters who come off as anything close to three-dimensional are Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner. Garner in particular is outstanding among the actors, and, with this script, you can put all of the credit with her talent. Her scene in the mall is a knockout (perfect for an Oscar clip, yes?). Really, the performances in general are pretty good. As soon as I saw Ellen Page in X-Men 3, I knew she would be a star. I hate the fact that I think X-Men 3 is her best movie so far, despite the two others she's had that garnered some critical acclaim (Hard Candy and the film presently being discussed). I do wish they'd given Michael Cera, so funny in Superbad, a little more to do. I'd like to propose that we stop Diablo Cody before she strikes again. This script CANNOT win Best Original Screenplay. If I start the hunger strike now, I should be able to get some media coverage. Oh, who am I fooling"
"lhhung_himself","1","68","141","14 January 2008"," The zipless pregnancy - a modern morality myth
","Let's face it - Juno gives basically the same message as the Oprah movies, ""Where the Heart is"" and the slightly better dressed up ""Waitress"". Despite, the outward Napoleon Dynamite trappings and Grey's Anatomy-chic music, this is really a Lifetime morality tale. The reason for all these films is to promote the idea of the alternative to abortion, and to make it as palatable as possible. They exist to sell the myth of the ""zipless"" pregnancy, one with no consequences.<br/><br/>In the Walmart movie, and ""Waitress"", helpful god-fearing people magically appear to provide money and support so that the single mom can go to school or open a pie baking shop. To anyone north of the Mason-Dixie, under the age of 40 who goes to church less than regularly, these films are laughable. To reach these people, Juno simply avoids the mess and basically just ignores any of the real problems involved in pregnancy while dressing up the process to make it look ""cool"".<br/><br/>However, the ""edginess"" is forced and phony and very much on the surface. Our hip adoptive parent who likes slasher movies and grunge, is really just another ""Lifetime"" caricature - the-irresponsible-man-boy-possibly-creepo male, to be exact. The father is well-meaning and loving and the best of all Lifetime male archetypes - the unquestioning-supporter (after all a 16 year old female knows more than any 45 year old male could...). And our protagonist is that ultra-cool misfit girl who thinks she knows everything and actually does know everything (including who ""Soupy Sales"" is). She is so savvy that although she is a punk hard rocker - she also loves acoustic alternative folk. She also has a geek boyfriend - another unquestioning-supporter male - who looks like Napoleon Dynamite. The dialog is forcedly sharp - with vocabulary that a 25 year-old poseur might have used in the 80s (""boss???"").<br/><br/>The morality play avoids the truly difficult questions: the emotional attachment to the child, the responsibility and feelings of the father and his family, the ostracism of a pregnant teen. These are brushed away as are the alternatives of keeping the baby, adoption by family members and of course ABORTION (legal, ethical and not a dirty word last I checked) which is treated as something gross for uncaring stupid people. And does our heroine learn to use contraceptives afterwards - no - condoms are grotty purple things for people with funny piercings not named Iggy Pop. She's so cool that she'll just abstain until she's ready.<br/><br/>Ugh. I prefer, honest manipulative films like ""Reefer Madness"" to subversive manipulative crap like ""Requiem for a Dream"" or ""Juno"". It's not that I don't support the option of having the baby but it definitely is not zipless and has consequences which can not and should not be ignored. Things are not going to be the same - they are not going to work themselves out - no kind stranger is going to raise the kid for you or give you a million dollars and a job. Teens understand this - better than the ""boss"" parents and clueless critics that will make this film a hit."

","First and foremost this is not a comedy because it is not funny at all. There are attempts but they are all either understated (Cera) or overstated (everyone else). This movie is being hailed by critics (if they hate something it's usually pretty good) and teeny boppers alike. I say that the groundswell audience for this movie is high school/college age student actresses/actors who like Ellen Page and Michael Cera (as have I) and regardless of what drivel comes out on the screen they will preen and heap accolades their way. Come on, this movie was terrible; much of the dialogue emanated from one of the rudest and quite surprisingly contrived teenagers in recent memory. I know many teenagers of all ilks and none of them act, talk or remotely resemble Juno, thankfully. You may say great, cutting edge, that's what were looking for, essentially though you may be out of your mind, nobody want's to be or have a world filled with teenagers that joke about drinking gallons of sunny d and taking pregnancy tests at a local convenience store, joshing with the all inappropriate clerk (stupid sequence), parents who allow their daughter to say whatever she want's to anyone and never ever, god forbid make a judgment! Juno is full of #*&!, she throws around hip names such as Soupy Sales, The Stooges and Mott the Hoople and it is quite realistic that a teen could have an affinity for these bands/people, although they are not related genre or era wise, so it seems forced, she is trying to be too cool. Do all you wannabe actresses really want to be knocked up and telling people off all the time? How about throwing up and then dumping Big Gulps down your supportive step mom's urn, come on! People keep comparing this movie to Little Miss Sunshine and Napoleon Dynamite and you know that's wrong. Those movies were funny, this flick was absurd as were the other two but unlike Napoleon and Sunshine this tormentor was without a real funny moment in the entire movie. This movie took a serious subject and took a talented cast and turned them all into a bunch of unlikable wise-asses including the transformation of Jason Bateman from a sincere adult to a possible molester in about fifteen minutes. You folks who are in the drama club and think that you have something here, take pause because the critics and fans of Ellen Page etc. may give this movie some awards for No Good Reason but if you buy into this drivel and try to emulate it, someday you may regret it."
"doggienate","2","200","450","22 December 2007"," Juno is not worth seeing - mind the praise
","Juno represents the mechanism of Hollywood and its ability to promote a film into popularity that is just a touch above average, with flaws and problems enough to have relegated it to obscurity in any other case.<br/><br/>To start: None of the dialog is believable. This should immediately rub people the wrong way, but it hasn't, which is all the more worrisome. These characters need heart and need to speak from it, but don't have it and weren't granted it by the writer. <br/><br/>As a result, the actors try to compensate for it all over the place. Sometimes this unintentionally works, most of the time, its like watching a brilliant train wreck: unintended and horrible yet fascinating for the things that weren't intended rather than the things that were. If these were the grounds on which Juno received praise, this would be acceptable. But they aren't. People are praising the things that crash and burn immediately. <br/><br/>If there is a ""tension"" in the performances of Ellen Page and the supporting characters, it is created not intentionally by the writing or direction, but unintentionally, by their natural inclination as actors and people to infuse these cold prose with some kind of life.<br/><br/>Rhythmic prosaic dialog should never be used again unless at a musical concert, free-form poetry convention or on a Broadway stage.<br/><br/>Because everyone speaks in the same ""smart"" way, its clear that all the characters are written by exactly the same person. Cody never empathizes with anyone, let alone demonstrates an understanding of a single human. <br/><br/>If you're wondering what happened to ""feel-good"" comedy, the label of which has become more of a curse than a description, Juno is it. This is the new ""feel-good,"" which was always a qualifier that just meant, ""feel good"" about this, even if there's nothing here to feel good about. With every over-extended sentence and quirky, poppy jab, the ""feel-good"" chips stack, until reaching tower of babel-like proportions. Hopefully, with a nudge from a smarter public, they'll topple eventually.<br/><br/>Snappy comments and overripe dialog don't necessarily make the film witty. If anything, I would argue they create the inverse effect - measured by the degree to which they over- extend their wit, wear out their welcome and become totems of a writer who repeats sub- textually in every line, ""look at me,"" without saying much else."

Well, who needs postmodern irony, anyway? We should all gaggle at the spectacle of ""real"" dialog and ""witty"" characters with a deep, profound sense of detached perspective.<br/><br/>This is derivative crap, and every character is an extension of the writer, and every line has been painstakingly poured over until it is ""perfect"", cuz that's how real life REALLY is. Well, movies aren't supposed to be ""real life"", but what's worse is when they pass this off as though it were, as though we're getting a special glimpse of it because we watched this MooVee.<br/><br/>This is a growing trend of ""indie"" features sold *before their release* as a ""cult classics"", a new stroke of Hollywood cynicism.<br/><br/>Give me no country with some old men."

It is amazing that some movies are so clichéd and so formulaic but critics and fans latch onto them like they are groundbreaking classics, while other movies who have a smattering of both are roundly panned although they are worthier films. No accounting for taste I guess.<br/><br/>Just to get this off my chest: Jennifer Garner can't act, period. She is a charmless, soulless, Hollywood creation. Her expressionless visage, Predator sized forehead, and nice behind may have worked well on the trite and equally soulless ALIAS but it doesn't work on the big screen. From her attempt at remaking BIG (dumb going on dumber--or was it 13 going nowhere), to the should have been career killing ELEKTRA, to the god-awful hackathon the KINGDOM, I think we've seen enough of Ben Affleck's Bennifer2. Maybe she should try directing. Affleck is much better behind the camera than in front of it.

None of the options: raising the baby yourself, giving it up for adoption, or abortion, is easy, either on the mother or the baby.

Thinking about it I realize, every movie i've seen this year is way way better than Juno: The Moguls is a good example, Eagle vs Shark (not American luckily) that was so great and fun to watch, weirdsville, Death at a funeral (not American), A Dogs Breakfast even License To Wed, Brothers Solomon & Waitress which at list had some glorious pies:) A few days ago I was dragged to see Rambo and boy if it was nominated for the Oscars I wouldn't get so mad about it and i would understand it better. It wasn't as bad as i thought. <br/><br/>So maybe it wasn't the best year for American films, but Juno? That is low.<br/><br/>And now for the leading actress, Ellen Page, which is one of the worst castings ever, if anybody called Ellen page's performance good or excellent I refer you to her brilliant performance in Hard Candy.

Even the logic of Cody's dialogue is flawed. It the confession scene with the parents, the girl thinks her father is asking who the baby is, rather than who the father is. If she were a ditz, the confusion would have some logic. Or even if the pacing or emotional pressure of the scene were at a real farce level, one might buy it.

I kept thinking: ""Someone needs to tell this girl that she is not Janeane Garofalo."" Michael Cera was good as always, but he could have been used a lot more before the latter parts of the movie, particularly in some way that would indicate he was fazed in the slightest by fathering a child. Meanwhile, if anything saved the film it was Jason Bateman's performance. Dead on.<br/><br/>Bottom line: This looked like a film that would be funny because we could all imagine we'd act the same way in a bad situation.

It's like the creators were more concerned with showing off their cool, modern dialogue they wrote for the movie, than the actual story itself. I was amazed at how many scenes could go by, and how much TALKING could be done by the characters, without anything interesting ever developing in the movie. I mean you literally have these scenes that go on for minutes, and it's showing all these inconsequential things that don't develop character or introduce the next beat to the story. I remember watching every scene and feeling like there was something that was about to happen, a lot of potential energy, but it goes nowhere. There were moments that were interesting to watch, like between Ellen Page and the lady's husband, which were well acted and genuine, but again, it's like the focus of these scenes are to show just how 'cool' these characters are, and it's at the expense of substance and realism. <br/><br/>My 4 cents:<br/><br/>**There's nothing worse than a movie that's supposed to be a comedy but not funny at all.<br/><br/>**Cool, Ellen Page plays the same character she played in Hard Candy, even had the red hoody. That's where the comparisons stop between the two movies.<br/><br/>**Jennifer Garner's facial reactions...failed. That was stupid and overdone. You got the camera showing her confused reactions and expressions to what Ellen Page was saying or doing, with this feeling that we as the audience are in the ""know"" of some joke, and her character is left out and doesn't get it, so we are laughing along with Ellen Page's character, except...there's no JOKE. There's nothing. So basically all you've got is this airheaded looking woman overacting and doing exaggerated contortions to her face, and it's just embarrassing and awkward.<br/><br/>**The only pop culture reference that was missing out of this movie was the word ""Ebay.""

If you are thinking of seeing this film, don't bother. If you have seen this film go and watch Garden State or a Wes Anderson film, or anything by the Coen Brothers or Tarrantino. Many of these films are slightly quirky and offbeat with very real and conversational dialogue, but it is all executed in a purposeful and realistic way. Its not just quirkiness for the sake of it."

","I would rather watch water evaporate! Any male with normal testosterone levels will hate this movie, I promise you that. As for females, you all better be able to relate to a girl (Ellen Page) who behaves less like a high-schooler and more akin to a S&M freak from the Bowery. Page's performance is lackluster, much like the development of her relationship with other characters.<br/><br/>If you came in looking for comedy, prepare to be disappointed. Page has her witty quips, but by the end of the film personal drama has engulfed the movie. I will not spoil the ending (as if it isn't completely devoid of meaning), but Juno chooses a path mostly disconnected from the plot. The choice of what to do with the child she is carrying (I don't believe this qualifies as spoiler seeing as she is clearly pregnant on the movie poster) takes a bizarre turn when a five minute scene reverses all we knew previously about several characters. Is anyone in this movie worthy of selling us on the fact that they have emotion? I don't believe so.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is so anemically bad that I was wishing I had been born deaf by the end of this film. I cannot understand what if any are the positive aspects of this film. My assumption is that it has a niche quality, defying logic for intelligent film-goers. This has been compared to Napoleon Dynamite, which I believed to be brilliant film. The same is not true for Juno. I felt like I was watching a bad painting. I would only recommend this movie to people who enjoy extreme mental torture."

","On a positive note, this movie offers a lot of funny (but too smart) lines and laughs. I can commend on the acting, esp. of main characters. There is a huge problem of believability in this film, however, since this movie does not belong to the genre of 'fantasy.' A sixteen year old troubled (a point her style in general as well as some direct remarks affirms) girl's pregnancy in a middle-class household can't simply be as smoothly accepted and handled as in this movie. The girl is unrealistically blasé about her nine month long pregnancy and giving her baby away for adoption; her father and step-mother are laudably calm, one might say, but also very irresponsible in warning her of future impact of this adoption for her life (a point numerous professional studies confirm); they also don't even bring up the issue of safe sex neither about her past sex nor her future sex. The movie, however, is not just unrealistic, but it is clearly a blatant propaganda in its brief presentation of the abortion clinic scene. The worker and the patients there are both presented as dark and ridiculous at best. The worker's offer of condom is outright denigrated. Given the difficult choices too many teen age girls and women in difficult situations deal with in the face of their unwanted pregnancy, I'm worried by the potential impact of the popular and critical success this movie enjoys."

","""A 16 year old girl finds herself pregnant, and decides to give the baby up for adoption."" That might sound like the setup for a movie. You would assume that this sentence would be just the starting block for a story, and then lots of other things would take place. But not in this case. This sentence is actually the synopsis of the entire movie.<br/><br/>There is almost no conflict at all in this story. Everybody loves everybody, everybody is supportive of everything, everybody is just fine most of the time; the one glitch that comes up along the way and which enticingly threatens to derail the proceedings, is swiftly resolved the next minute without much apparent consequence.<br/><br/>So it's all very nice and heartwarming, but not really conducive to an engaging experience for the viewer. I'm not saying it is a terrible film, actually it flows along pleasantly (if you can put up with the inordinate abuse of quirky incidental music with absurd lyrics, which I sometimes had trouble with), but it barely makes a ripple as it goes."

Michael Cera portrays the same socially detached high schooler that he has in other movies, exactly the same way as before. Jason Bateman does alright as the unsure father to be, but Jennifer Garner's baby obsession comes off as incredibly forced and almost as jarring and annoying as the main character.<br/><br/>The soundtrack to this film sounds like it was recorded in someone's basement, and only further helps to annihilate what little emotion and drama existed.<br/><br/>The plot is uninteresting, the characters are dull and boring, and the movie itself is a perfect waste of 95 minutes.<br/><br/>Don't see it.

I find Juno's precocity irritating, as indeed most teenagers are. she likes music, has eclectic tastes, yeah and....!! she is oh so world weary, and cynical .... yeah,at sixteen! and for some reason we are meant to see this as unusual fora sixteen year old girl. well i don't know about you, but this pretty much described half my rather conventional school friends of my own teenage years - <br/><br/>struggling with a teenage pregnancy and exploring a wholesome ending might be worthwhile viewing, but i found everything about the exploration dishonest. the film was intent in provoking the audiences respect for this putatively spiky sixteen year old, and did not delve into any deeper issues. It was so superficial, and to my mind frustrating for a more challenging and honest story is there to be had with pretty much the same story line, just not in this film.<br/><br/>the most moving moments, well to me the only moving moments, were Jennifer garner, playing a prickly middle aged woman desperate for a child, stripped of her shell as she holds her adopted baby for the first time. and Michale Cara as always is an extraordinary presence but as the for the rest no, i would rather watch the Brady bunch which at least has an awareness of its own superficiality."

The bewildered father of the unwanted child takes the news as if his girlfriend had developed a large pimple that wouldn't go away for awhile.<br/><br/>Yes, there is a somewhat interesting story here at the core, but everyone is so busy being glibly hip that they do their level best to conceal it and deny us any true movie enjoyment.<br/><br/>Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner do a creditable job as the well-to-do potential adoptive couple, with a smoldering hostility underneath. But the real scene stealer here is J.K. Simmons as Juno's dad, looking like a middle-aged Dwight Eisenhower, and coming off very human and daddish. Again the writers and director do their level best to screw this character up, but Simmons perseveres.<br/><br/>The movie features an extremely annoying soundtrack of cutesy-poo non-rhyming gibberish designed to sound hip and now. It also features one of the worst endings in recent memory. It teaches us that any behavior is OK, responsibility is overrated, and things will always work out if you're cool.

If one of the other movies win the Oscar; I'll go insane. This movie Juno is NOT funny, if you laugh at it, you are just laughing a some 16 year old girl actor reading from a scrip; which is not even believable for any age group. I only get upset with movies when people get sucked in by the hype. If you like Indy movies then just get Napoleon Dynamite out again instead; at least when he goes head over heals on his bike, that's funny!

","A movie like this is hard to review. On one hand, I can disparage an entire audience for liking this movie for reasons that are well beyond my means of comprehension. On the other hand, well, I can lie through my teeth. The truth is, I feel seasoned enough with the silver-screen to know what makes a movie great. And what you might ask makes a movie great? Performances, story-line, the dialogue and script, and the deliverance of each of these are some aspects among many that make a great movie. A low budget movie can have all of these dynamics sharpened to perfection and will stand out with crowds and is something that has been seen before in other independent movies such as Garden State and Napoleon Dynamite. From what I've heard and what I know, it is my understanding that Juno had a large PR budget which aided it in reaching out to it's appropriate audience, and lo and behold the power of the mighty PR; a multitude of positive reviews for this movie that range from the well-respected opinion's of movie critics such as Roger Ebert to the every day movie-goer who gave it a standing ovation the second the credits rolled. Juno received anything but a standing ovation from me. The performance was not what bothered me, all the actor's and actresses worked well with what they had, which without regard did very little to satisfy me. What bothered me was the shockingly horrifying attempt at professional script writing by the movie's stripper-turned-journalist, Diablo Cody. From what I hear, she's a journalistic hipster exhalted by Minneapolis Newspapers and Minneapolis audiences alike, and the dialogue in Juno's script was evidence of her catastrophically crash-and-burned attempt at emulating the whopping success of the sharp and heavily wit-worded WB shows made famous by the late Gilmore Girls. I was not impressed and anybody who was apparently has not seen Gilmore Girls, and that includes Roger Ebert who's on-the-cover excerpt from his review of the movie declares the dialogue to be quick and funny, which it is neither of those two things. The so-so story line had it's needed zig-zags to prevent a movie about teen pregnancy from emanating the feeling that you've been watching the 90 minute movie for the whole nine months, but the zig-zags were at times trite and scatterbrained. A few of the events in the movie made one wonder why that was even bothered with in the first place. Several scenes in the movie seemed to produce a sense of possible excitement to the story-line that only ended up falling short and thus producing little other than a disappointing outcome. With as many fans as this movie has somehow formed, I still have to recommend a pass for this movie. Save your money and save your time, which are two things that this movie completely robs you of. Sometimes a well-done performance, such as those done by Ellen Page and Jennifer Garner, are not nearly enough to save a movie that attempts to appeal to Napoleon Dynamite/Hot Topic type audiences and furthermore delivers a quality-lacking script that falls far short of creating the intended quick and witty hipster wannabe dialogue that only exposes the writer as a pretentious amateur who should stick to robbing lonely, inebriated men with lap dances in the VIP room than innocent movie goers who were fooled by a large PR budget and a potentially charming story-line, which might I add, went terribly awry for scattered periods of time during this film. I will leave this review with one final note - if Amy Sherman-Palladino had anything to do with this script, it would have made a world of difference and likely would have been more than enough to change my opinion, as it would have delivered the correct wording that I believe Diablo Cody was looking for."

First off, this is actually a very good movie, speaking in strictly technical terms, but I don't like it. The acting is good, with Hard Candy star Ellen Page putting on an awesome performance, and the supporting cast being equally convincing, and the directing is fine. But everything else just drags the movie down in a steep slide.<br/><br/>Mostly this is just too annoying and cutesy to ever be worth anything other than usage as a beer coaster. The character of Juno always has some sort of witty comment or snide remark, and - surprise! - all of the side characters usually do, too, and it is horribly irritating, a one-trick pony of a comedy cop-out that might make prissy teenagers laugh and feel endowed with a sense of superiority to their peers, but if you like good comedy, this will just come off as stale. The dialogue? MAN, THAT IS AWFUL. ""Yo yiggidy yo""? ""Forshizz""? And the overwrought use of ""like""? Barf-central. Jason Reitman seems to think that if he throws enough pseudo-witty jokes and one liner cracks at a wall, he'll create a Comedic Masterpiece, but it just doesn't work that way. There isn't anything really funny underneath all the ""hip"" dialogue and the attempted wit.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is almost as bad. A load of pretentious, sappy indie emo rock crapola that will do nothing but make you scratch your head and wonder why it's there. Oh, is that part of what makes this movie intelligent and deep? I'm sorry.<br/><br/>But the real problem is the fact that this movie seems to try to be intellectual and deep with its story about teenage pregnancy and the emotional issues surrounding it, but the whole thing is encased in the sort of disgusting ""ironic"" humor that seems to pass as thought provoking and soulful these days - Juno trivializes these issues and makes them seem small and insignificant (Juno referring to her situation as ""being in a pickle,"" for instance...), and that shoots this right down the crapper. This is too candyflossed and fluffed up to achieve anything it sets out to do, and so it is a failure."

Fearing abortion, Juno instead, seek to find a family for her unborn child for them to raise. It's here, where she meets the couple of Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) & Mark Loring (Jason Bateman), who seems like the right people to give her baby up for adoption. However, things started to unravel with the couple, causing Juno to re-examine the relationships in her own life, and wonder if any kind of love can really last a lifetime. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while the ""Teen Pregnancy"" angle has been done to death in films, way before this movie came out; this movie was one of the very first films to deliver the 'teen pregnancy' concept in a mature, but meaningful comedy way. Even if foreign movies like Korean films like 2005's 'Jenny, Juno' somewhat did it first. While, this movie wasn't groundbreaking in any means, it still had a quirky story was unique enough to stand out for its calmer, yet gender tone. It's not a film that, that makes teen pregnancy seem like the end all of end all. I guess, the movie knows teenagers are going through a lot, so it doesn't make them, feel even worst about themselves. It really could had been worst, like how they portray these events in 1998's TV Movie 'Fifteen and Pregnant' that comes across, as too preachy, depressing and unpleasant. I like that the parents played by Allison Janney & J.K Simmons. They are the best things about this movie. They weren't over-the-top harsh, and controlling with Juno. They had the right amount of discipline and care for parents dealing with a problem like this. It's nice is to see a cool-headed approach. However, I can't say, the same with Jennifer Gardner and Jason Bateman's characters. I really found their scenes with Juno, way too awkward and creepy. Yes, I know, they were written that way, but I really didn't like the whole 'molesting' angle. This dark subplot really didn't fit with the sunny-side tone of the rest of the film. That scene ain't Etch A Sketch. This is one doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet. I'm still having nightmares about those scenes. Another character, I really didn't like, is Paulie Bleeker. Michael Cera is pretty much, playing himself with this role. He wasn't really that memorable, nor likable. Even Ellen Page as Juno could be a bit annoying at times. Don't get me wrong, Juno does have some really good funny or mature moments, mostly with her parents, but the highly gimmicky and awkwardly dialogue that Diablo Coby wrote for her character and her friend, Leah (Olivia Thirby), can be a bit much for me. I found their silly dialogue, bit unrealistic at times. It was too quirky at times. Plus, some of the slang that Coby use, is somewhat dated, even for 2007. Another problem with screenplay is the fact, that Diablo Cody indicates that the film was meant to be neutral on the subject of pro-choice and pro-life. Yet, it seems to lean to one way. While, I have no problem with its pro-life approach. After all, Juno's namesake is the Roman goddess of, among other things, fertility and childbirth. The protagonist even says that she was named after the goddess. Plus, the fact, that, we wouldn't have a film without Juno's pro-life choice. Still, I want to believe that people should had a choice if they want to a child or not. Anyways, I still think, Coby deserve the best original screenplay award at the Oscars that year, despite my personal beliefs. Another thing, the film could had done, better, is make it seem like Juno was honestly pregnant. Her mother bump did look a bit fake at times. Still, I have to say, director Jason Reitman and his crew did filmed the movie, very well, despite that little nitpick. For the most part, the film was very bright and vibrant. I kinda dig the Wes Andersen's style, Juno title sequence. It stood out, because it transforms real sequences into a sort of cartoon. Names and texts are hand-drawn and are mixed up into the sequence. Background loses its depth and becomes flat. The final effect is really cute, even if a bit out of place! I love the creativity of this sequence. I also like the music that went along with this film. The film's soundtrack, featuring several songs performed by Kimya Dawson in various guises was also amazing. My favorite song is the Moldy Peaches version of ""Anyone Else but You"". It match the visuals so well. Also, it really did sum up what I thought of 2007 independent filmmaking. While, this movie was one of three films in 2007, that had a plot that dealt with a woman face unplanned pregnancy. It's by far, one of the better films; even with the ambiguous odd ending and the fact, Juno somewhat shows disrespect to her elders. I suggest others to watch this movie. So call your friends on your hamburger-shaped phones, and pull up a chair, and check this movie out. Also check out, 2016's 'Tallulah', with a similar plot and some of the same actors. You will like it."

C'mon guys!!!Those people at the academy must've gone totally crazy!The story is OK, but very bad presented, very unrealistic. It's like a 16 year old says to her parents:""Mom,dad, I'm pregnant!"" ""Oh,really?That's OK."" I tell you those are dream parents, most of them would have reacted this way in real life...yeah right! Juno is definitely the worst Oscar nomination in years.I consider myself a movie freak, watch every year about 100 flicks, lots of crap(like ""Juno""), some good, some average. <br/><br/>Among this years nominations there are two masterpieces:""There will be blood"" and ""No country for old men"".I'm not sure which one of those two will get the Oscar, but I would bet my money on ""There will be blood"". <br/><br/>""Atonement"" and ""Michael Clayton"" are OK, but way far from calling them ""best picture"" and giving them an award. But ""Juno""...""Juno"" is crap!If you want to watch a story about getting pregnant, watch ""Knocked up"", its at least funnier.The only reason you could possibly have, to go and see Juno, is if you are desperately in love with Jennifer Garner(good acting, beautiful as always).Otherwise don't waste your money on this.Here is a list of 10 movies(have seen them all) from 2007 that are much better than Juno and could have been nominated instead.If you wanna watch real cinema, watch these: 1.American gangster 2.In the valley of Elah 3.The assassination of J. James.. 4.Gone baby gone 5.3:10 to Yuma 6.Eastern promises 7.Elizabeth the golden age 8.Charlie Wilson's war 9.Things we lost in the fire 10.The kite runner<br/><br/>So it is not like Hollywood doesn't have something to offer.It remains a mystery to me how ""Juno"" got nominated.Nor can I explain how Ellen Page(who?) got nominated for an actress in a leading role.

You can't empathise with her as she isn't believable, it's just another attempt to be alternative, with a standard alternative drop out character, with all the stereotypical traits that she should have. It's like every character like this is the same, do the same things, listen to the same things, think the same things, are into the same things! In reality this simply isn't true.

","I just can't believe it. Yes, this movie is overrated, but is worst: Is tendentious and naive. It's not a realistic approach to this subject. It's a moralistic fairy tale disguised as dark comedy (an old trick, by the way). It depicts a shallow and distorted view of abortion in the first minutes, like a dirty and almost illegal choice to unwanted pregnancy. Then, Juno turns in a predictable and antiquated speech about maternity, responsibility, family... that kind of 'feeling good' movie.<br/><br/>I agree, Ellen Page is brilliant, but the dialog is unrealistic and full of cliché. And the Jason Reitman direction is completely flat and impersonal. Really, is that bad."

","It was different and refreshing when I first watched it. If I wrote a review the very moment I saw the film, I would have given it a 9 out of 10. Now, after almost half a year, the feeling has passed and I feel the film is very overrated.<br/><br/>Ellen Page does give a very good performance. It can be seen she cares about the role and she gives the role all her energy and devotion. Yet...is her performance Oscar worthy? That is up for debate. Like the film, her performance is good but forgettable.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is solid. Jennifer Garner does her job rather well, and is there a more awkward kid than Michael Cera? He is born to play Bleeker. Nevertheless, Diablo Cody does not deserve her Oscar. Truthfully, her writing is shallow and empty. There are more deserving candidates.<br/><br/>""Juno"" is good, but empty. There is no deep or life-changing message within the film, and this film is just like the language within the film and the western culture: a fad. After the initial awe and surprise pass, it will not stand the test of time and will not be remembered.<br/><br/>I would recommend Waitress, because it has more ""heart"", or Knocked Up, because it is more funny. Juno is somewhere in between, and quite frankly, it remains there. It takes the quality of both films, but it does not exceed or stand out from either films.<br/><br/>6/10"
"pmontag","3","39","82","24 January 2008"," I don't quite understand all the hype ...
","At the screening of Juno I went to at the Uptown theater in Minneapolis, it was a packed house and an usher introduced the movie at the front of the theater, saying 'everybody, you're in for an awesome movie; it's so good. When you leave the theater, please exit at the front due to the large crowd.'<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, the theater was laughing pretty hard and was moved throughout. Now, I don't want to come down too hard on this movie and make such a fuss that I come off as a negative, hateful person. Anyone who spends all the hard work making a movie is then up for criticism by those who see it and you hope that everyone involved is aware of sensibility issues and that it's okay for some people not to like their movie if they're being honest.<br/><br/>And that's just it, if I'm being honest, the fact that Juno is garnering this much praise seems silly. But I have vast concerns that my tastes are not well suited for what the culture dictates as good. <br/><br/>The best part of this movie, by far, is the character played by Jennifer Gardner. I think it's well written, believable and emotional. I liked Jason Bateman's character until he said rock n' roll music was at its best in 1993. Though Juno disagrees with him, it seems reasonable to conclude that the writer of this movie thinks the rock scene of 1993 is pretty good, but just not the best. Right there, this represents a lot of trouble. Rock n' roll in 1993 was disastrous compared to the times when it was good. And it only gets much worse when you hear a 16 year old girl saying things like, 'After hearing Iggy and the Stooges do Raw Power, everything else sounds precious in comparison.' This 16 year old girl sounds like a 28 year old man throughout the movie. And why do kids or high schoolers have to be such smart asses in the movies these days. I think it translates annoyingly to the screen.<br/><br/>What happens in Juno has been happening too much in the cinema of the past couple decades - there are too many dialogue scenes about what people's tastes are like - Tarantino may get the award for this. And where does all this come from? Maybe Woody Allen? I don't know for sure, but I like it a lot better when I go to a movie and visit a place that's engaging and emotional. I think the dialogue-driven, here's what I like, hipster speech types of approaches make for movies that real movie-lovers are not going to like.<br/><br/>I don't think a movie like Juno is really a movie. It's a TV show. It's meant to be watched on that smaller screen in your house. Obviously, I'm in the minority opinion because everyone seems to like this movie, and this adds one more reason as to why I do feel pretty alone a lot of the time on this planet."
"Grant_Price","7","36","75","21 January 2008"," I do try hard to be cool
","OK, get this. Juno was written by a lady called Diablo Cody. How cool is that? That's got to be one of the coolest names of all time (after Max Power of course.) It's a shame she didn't channel her coolness into the film's script, which, though charming and fuzzy and consistent, doesn't exactly go for the jugular. Juno tells the story of a sixteen year old girl named Juno MacGuff, played by the breathtakingly beautiful and rather talented Ellen Page, who finds herself pregnant after enjoying spontaneous sex with her best friend. Her eventual course of action is to put the baby up for adoption and soon finds the seemingly perfect couple, Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, respectively.) However, and this came as a total shock, things don't all go to plan and Juno finds herself reassessing the situation and her life in general. Now, everybody knows that this type of film (Zach Braff's Garden State also instantly springs to mind) involves a dramatic event prompting the protagonist to meander their way through the film and eventually learn a valuable life lesson, all the while accompanied by an indie-based soundtrack. That is not important. What IS important are the things occurring around the story and for the most part Juno gets it right. The majority of the characters are quirky and funny, the highlights being the eponymous heroine and Bleeker (Michael Cera), the guy responsible for getting Juno in the pudding club, so to speak. Their actions and dialogue may not elicit spasmodic fits of laughter but they are responsible for placing the smile on your face which remains from beginning to end. Plus, I found myself actually caring about Juno's plight. Director Jason Reitman does not shy away from the subject matter (good job too, because he'd have little else to work with) and avoids making the mistake of asserting that teenage pregnancy is funny. The jokes are made parallel to the pregnancy, not at the expense of it. For example, at one point Juno is visiting the prospective adopting couple, staying a while when Vanessa suggests that she should be returning home on account of her parents worrying about her, to which Juno replies: ""Nah... I mean, I'm already pregnant, so what other kind of shenanigans could I get into?"" It's sentences like that that make Juno a worthwhile film experience.<br/><br/>However, there were a few elements which, though inoffensive enough on their own, when combined over the 96 minute running time annoyed the hell out of me. Why do independent productions always have to have title credits that look like they were designed by somebody who failed to gain entry into art school (Hitler, for example)? And always with the Red House Painters guitar pop played over the top. It doesn't look or sound good. The music all the way through was pretty bad actually, especially the frequent name-dropping conversations between Juno and Mark to firstly show how much of a cool guy Mark is and secondly to show just how damn quirky Juno really is. Mentioning Sonic Youth and/or the late seventies punk movement will never earn you any esteem. Also, the burger phone was irksome. It isn't enough that it appears several times; it has to get a mention too, as though we haven't noticed it. ""Oh, sorry I'm on my burger phone, it doesn't work very well."" Yes, great. We can see you have a phone shaped like a quarter-pounder, NEXT.<br/><br/>Although Juno does try its hardest to feed the audience a novelty communication device, it is one of those films people should watch now and again to confirm that they are not indeed emotionally dead but are actually still able to remember what happiness, however faint, feels like. Ellen Page seems like a lady who would be cool just to hang out with, the dialogue is intelligent and snappy, a Gibson Les Paul makes a welcome appearance and, of course, the ending is the equivalent to swallowing a tablespoon of sugar while swimming in a bath of syrup. You cannot go wrong."
"real_scripts","1","13","23","2 March 2010"," Unbelievably bad
","This is a testament to the fact that big companies can make almost anyone love something with enough marketing. This one seems to have a lot going for it. It's pseudo-independent, with a little known actress. It's relatively low budget, and it's quirky. (A quality the mainstream seems to automatically accept as misunderstood genius every time now days.) In the end even Jennifer Garner's multi-million dollar smile can't save this one.<br/><br/>A few days prior I had watched ""My Life in Ruins"" and I didn't think dialog could get much worse, but ""Juno"" outdoes it by miles. The sparse laughs in ""My Life in Ruins"" turns to maybe one wry smile throughout the whole of ""Juno."" The writing is terrible, especially the main character and her family are unbearable. She doesn't talk like a teenager. She runs her mouth constantly throughout the whole film and uses buzz words and phrases from pop culture throughout the whole movie. It's not in the least natural sounding at all. She's just plain stupid, stupid as a teenager and stupid as a mom. Her parents seem incredibly stupid also.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, she's dropping names like Dario Argento, and Juno says ""This is even way better than Suspiria."" First of all, what would a horror fan even be comparing those two directors for? Secondly, no Argento fan would suddenly claim Lewis is better. That had to be the writer forcing her own misguided views into the film. I mean that would be like trying to compare Alfred Hitchcock and Guillermo Del Toro, and just coming out saying Hitchcock was way better. There's a certain degree where you just can't compare two artists. The scene is just one small example from a horribly written film.<br/><br/>The film not only insulting to teens it's also insulting to mothers and to motherhood in general. I can't believe anyone likes this film, but I wish people would stop rating it so high because the film industry is going to keep making crap movies like this if people keep encouraging them."
"oneloveall","5","47","102","6 December 2007"," Knocked Up meets Napolean Dynamite = eh
","Although Juno may be a front-runner for this year's celebrated independent film, this teen pregnancy yarn contains many of the same quirky letdowns that have become low-budget, dialog-heavy staples for over a decade. In a script littered with overdone wit, first timer Diablo Cody does demonstrate an occasional worthwhile perspective amongst the onslaught of girly cynicism's, but as it is, lead Ellen Page simply gives off a self-consciousness much too mature in her mannerisms, delivery, and speech, turning her into the opposite of the authentic character she is supposed to be. Most of the cast, especially the younger ones, feel slightly amateurish as well, surprisingly letting people like Jeniffer Garner steal away what slight thunder there is to be had. An uneventful follow-up to Jason Reitman's very solid Thank You for Smoking, the movie does hold few tender moments, many sarcastic ones, but rarely any truthful ones."

","Juno was a good movie at the most but certainly not anything close to a great movie. This movie tries too hard to be witty and cute when in reality it comes off as annoying and unrealistic. For example: If your teenage daughter gets pregnant I doubt you will start cracking jokes about it especially 2 minutes after you hear it. There were a few nice aspects of the film.<br/><br/>The acting of Ellen Page was pretty good and a had a nice warm feeling surrounding her. There was also Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner who came off as the only realistic characters in the film as a married couple about to adopt Juno's soon to be born baby. The rest of the characters (partly because of the writing and acting) in the film who were supposed to be quirky and unusual were just too laid back at the situation at hand. This movie plays itself off a realistic to a tone of that of Little Miss Sunshine yet the characters come off as corny and unaware of the delicate situation that is the central theme of this film.<br/><br/>Despite many of these flaws I do not think there was much of an area the film could have been improved upon. The film's idea was a bit too ambitious in trying to make a comedy out of a teen pregnancy in the way it was. This film has been often compared to Little Miss Sunshine yet there is a reason for why that movie is considered original. Of course it is because of the balance it was able to create between comedy and a realistic drama. Juno tried to do this as well but failed to accomplish simply because the idea of the film simply isn't that funny, at least not in the way this film presented it."

","I'm not one of those high-and-mighty indie kids who scoffs at any film or artist as soon as they reach mainstream success (see: Andrew Bird, Animal Collective, Feist, Cat Power, The Strokes for recent examples). I *do* get annoyed, however, when people follow trends they aren't really a part of. You know, like the teenagers who walk around wearing Che Guevara t-shirts talking about how great Bob Marley is? It's all social pop culture rubbish that irritates me on many levels.<br/><br/>So I flinched when Juno (Ellen Page) says her heroes are Patti Smith and Iggy Pop and the Stooges in this film. Is Iggy Pop awesome? Of course. Is ""Raw Power"" a great album? Yes. Do fans of The Stooges refer to the band as ""Iggy and the Stooges"" and leave out ""Fun House"" when praising them? No. ""Raw Power"" is the album people often associate with Iggy and the Stooges because it had the most success out of their three albums (I'm not counting ""The Weirdness"") and is often considered the best, so it's the obvious empty choice someone who is unfamiliar with their actual work would choose to define them; but a *real* self-respecting Stooges fan would know better, and they wouldn't refer to that band as Iggy Pop. And don't get me started on the Patti Smith reference.<br/><br/>Or the Sonic Youth stuff.<br/><br/>""Juno"" plays like a film made by people who are jumping on a trend and attempting to popularize it. Wes Anderson already did this but he knew what he was doing and didn't market his films that way, and they've been thriving as far back as a decade now in indie cult status without 45-year-old soccer moms rushing out to stores to buy the ""Rushmore"" soundtracks. I can still listen to the Kinks without feeling like I've bought into some kind of marketing fad. But ""Juno"" has done a lot to make me feel guilty about driving around blaring ""Raw Power"" these days. <br/><br/>Is that my own problem? Certainly. But that smug, cutesy ""fakeness"" that permeates this entire film is the reason I don't think it's worthy of half the acclaim it's garnered.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm too cynical. But what I see happening here is the following: the film is popularizing a social trend that, by its very definition, is anti-mainstream. Sonic Youth and other indie music began two decades ago and ""Juno"" is giving a thrill to Wal-Mart shoppers who are suddenly hearing all this ""different"" music (like the Moldy Peaches) that they never knew existed before. And they're fascinated by it. Moldy Peaches shot to the top of the digital charts after ""Juno"" came out (Kimya Dawson's MySpace has taken a sudden revamp) and my local record store sold ""Raw Power"" and ""Horses"" both for the first time in two years.<br/><br/>I have nothing with turning people on to good music. I have a problem with programming people to follow social trends (e.g. the aforementioned Che Guevara issue) almost entirely unaware of what they're really doing. If people knew half the stuff Guevara had actually done they probably wouldn't feel comfortable wearing those shirts. Likewise, I have to question whether the sixty-something-year-old man I saw buying a soundtrack for ""Juno"" a couple weeks ago is really going to appreciate Sonic Youth.<br/><br/>Maybe I sound like an elitist? I'm really not. I think Sonic Youth are fairly overrated, for example (although they're still very good) mainly for the same reason I think ""Juno"" is overrated: people jump on certain trends and follow them.<br/><br/>""Juno's"" dialogue, as such, is derived from this self-conscious hipster crap that grates on my nerves so much these days. (God help us if Diablo Cody continues this massacre.) It starts from the very first scene (using spins on pop culture phrases or items such as ""Eggos"" - har-har) and doesn't let up.<br/><br/>Ellen Page is a convincing actress but then you realize she isn't acting and she becomes less convincing. She's playing herself. Watch ANY interview with her from before or after ""Juno"" - she is this character. Is that a problem? No, because to the extent of playing herself - a smug, condescending indie kid who doesn't know half as much as she thinks she does - it works for the film. But she's going to quickly reveal herself to be a one-trick pony as more people catch on to the fact that this character is actually her. Jay Leno didn't look too happy when he found out last week on his talk show.<br/><br/>I suppose my rant took up most of my review but I think it explains in many ways my feelings towards this film's content. I found it somewhat amusing/entertaining and it had a few genuinely nice moments, but it's far from the masterpiece some like Roger Ebert would have you believe. It's popularizing this new-age indie hipster sarcasm and the film's going to influence a LOT of films on down the line over the next few years. NONE of them will have as much impact or success as ""Juno"" and then trends will change and it'll stop. But first we'll have to put up with a million clones of the same formula and more ""witty"" pop culture puns and dry sarcasm. Spielberg did this with the kids in his movies back in the '80s and the dire response of ""Hook"" finally caused him to cease and desist. Hopefully the transition for filmmakers right now won't take as long."

Outside of Page and the neat opening credits (for some reason director Reitman has a way with opening credits like in his previous cinematic turkey Thank You for Smoking...and little else) this movie is cringe inducing cutesy poo movie-making at its worst. The parents of Juno are right out of any John Hughes teen dramady from the eighties while the couple looking to adopt Juno's child are strictly paint by the numbers suburban zombies, especially Jennifer Garner's painfully clichéd wannabe mother.

I wasn't moved by the climax, nor did I even really care what happened to the characters. I didn't think the third act redeemed the first 2/3, it just shifted the film from 'nearly unbearable to sit through' to 'incredibly bland and mediocre'. And the music was simply terrible. I thought the actors, by and large, did the best with what they had, but they couldn't rescue the film from its terrible screenplay."

","""Juno"" feels like a movie churned out by irresponsible, incompetent corporate hipsters for up-and-coming ever-more-shallow teenage hipsters. It has nothing to say about pregnancy (though it seems to be pro-life, whatever that means to you), does not take the responsibility of teen pregnancy seriously, is not realistic in its character portrayals, the script does not function to transmit the story, and it is not ever funny (yes, it actually makes ""Knocked Up"" look like a masterpiece). Of course, I was only watching ""Juno"" to make sure I, uh... yeah I don't know why I watched it.<br/><br/>Honestly, this movie felt like a big slap in the face. This won an Oscar for its screenplay? I don't have high hopes for Oscar ceremonies but good grief! Apparently this was written by a twenty-something ex-stripper, ex-blogger who goes by the name Diablo Cody. Not that I have anything against her past professions or hobbies, but this writing is vapid, jerky, amateur and betrays a nihilistic vanity that tries to trade dopey Suicide Girl/Indie-rock cuteness for cleverness. Most of the dialog consists of internet slang or currently hip things to say amongst white suburban indie-rock/punk-ish kids who go to college or live in a group-house. In other words, this is the pinnacle of corporate sludge being marketed as counter-culture. It's feeding regurgitated jokes to the same people who already use them.<br/><br/>It's not just the dialog. The whole movie is emblazoned by this: the music is a constant barrage of Elliott Smith rip-off artists (who are exceptionally dopey and spoiled sounding) and the costumes and sets look like really grimy versions of a Wes Anderson movie, maybe combined with the aesthetic of that old MTV show, ""Daria"" (although don't be confused by my assessment, since Daria was actually a decent show with a message -- it's just the aesthetic that has been copied). And Juno really relies on music to both indicate the emotional texture of the scenes (spoiled, whiny, fake cuteness) and to transition between them.<br/><br/>By the time the movie is halfway finished, you're just praying for someone to shut Ellen Page's character up. I guess she's supposed to be spunky or wise or some other completely irrelevant fake adjective for her obviously insecure and depressing character. I really don't know or care. I do know that the most important relationship in the movie -- the one between her and Michael Cera (here playing a character that acts just like Michael Cera) -- is given the least amount of attention of any relationship in the movie. It's brushed-over, undynamic and undeveloped. What gives? <br/><br/>Man, this movie actually seems malicious. It's like if someone made a nihilistic bubbly comedy about how having a baby is made of win. Yes, made of win. But unfortunately this movie is made of epic fail."

Not only is the dialog painfully clever, most of the wall-to-frikkin-wall soundtrack is adolescent hipster pop-rock garbage. Remember the band Cub? If you're as haunted by their cloyingly amateurish Shonen Knife-ness as I was, then you'll loathe listening to the preenie angst chimed throughout Juno. A shame since great bands like B&S have songs cutting into the over abundance of squeaky juvenilia. Best Picture nomination?

"illbebackreviews","1","7","11","22 January 2013"," Juno is a bad movie with bad dialogue, poor acting, overused and boring story and the most irritating characters in this 90 minute torture
","Juno is a movie that I could compare to to the Prequel Star Wars trilogy. Bad acting, terrible dialogue resulting in bad jokes that are just overused, crappy characters and a story, which instantly make the movie itself a fail and an unrealistic premise Teenage pregnancy is a good idea to make a movie about especially considering the problems nowadays with teen pregnancy but this film on many occasions made teenage pregnancy feel like a good thing. I mean, half the movie the character Juno is walking around, running, riding bikes, eating like a fatass that the whole thing becomes unrealistic.<br/><br/>Next the characters in the movie actually irritate me. There is NOT one character who I like in this movie and so, when the film comes to those emotional moments towards the end of the movie, I couldn't care less about them because the characters weren't made into interesting people to whom we could relate to.<br/><br/>The way the movie started, I knew I was in for a bad one. It starts with Juno standing and saying, abruptly, ""It all began"" type narrative that is just so abrupt. Give the audience a chance to breathe will ya! The story and the characters would be so much better if Juno, during the narration, took some time to explain what her life had been like during her life and they could've made her into someone who during her whole life suffered from disaster after disaster but they make her some happy girl who has sex and has a baby. There is no sympathizing with characters when that happens. If we had come to know more about her life before she became pregnant, the story would really flush together nicely and each character could be well flushed out. There would then be substance and an interest.<br/><br/>The overacting in the movie, especially by Ellen Page, frustrated me the whole way through. It becomes so obvious as the movie progresses exactly how much Ellen Page overacts. This isn't necessarily her fault, it could just be the director's choice but that all goes down to poor acting and bad direction and execution. All the actors, especially Juno's boyfriend or whoever the hell that kid was, just had pale expressions due to bad acting Now the writing in the movie is just awful. Its like George Lucas decided to be the writer for the movie and just messed it up. If the movie is a comedy, then a skillful writer is in need. But when the story is completely messed up because of bad writing nothing is funny. I could NOT LAUGH ONCE IN THIS 90 MINUTE MESS! That all goes down to bad acting.<br/><br/>So did I like anything about the movie? No. Why? Because the whole story itself didn't need to take 90 minutes of Juno being a douche after she finds out she's pregnant. The movie only needed to be a 20 minute TV Show episode.<br/><br/>I highly recommend NOBODY to see this movie. It doesn't deserve people to waste 90 minutes of their life on this pile of crap. Also, IMDb isn't a site to always trust. 7.7 for Juno???? DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE"

","""Juno"" has got to be one of the most overrated movies in recent memory. The annoying hipster dialog by a knocked up teenage girl along with the annoying ""indie"" music is tiresome. The more you watch ""Juno"" the more you think to yourself ""this won an Oscar for best original screenplay?"" I think the voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences along with critics were enthralled by the writer Diablo Cody (not her real name and Diablo is the Spanish masculine version of the word devil, it should actually be Diabla), ex-stripper turned writer more than the actual film and then they projected that admiration towards it.<br/><br/>The best quote about this movie comes from ""Variety's Peter Bart: ""I like the movie, but it seemed to me Juno talked more like a 30-year-old ex-stripper trying to make a name for herself as a screenwriter."" And that's the way that Ellen Page played the part, not as a teen but as an annoying 30 something trying to still be cool and hip.<br/><br/>You have to see this movie more than once in order to grasp how truly OVERRATED it is. ""Knocked Up"" is more realistic than this trite. I actually lowered my rating for the film."
"brendoman","9","25","52","28 November 2007"," One of the best of the year!
","Since I got to see the theatrical cut of the film last night I figured I would finally post my thoughts on this great flick. This was my third time seeing it and I still dug the heck out of it. The dialog, which could have come off as pretentious and/or downright stupid, is fantastic. When I wasn't laughing at the jokes I was smiling at its charm. The performances are really what makes the movie shine. Ellen Page as Juno is just great. I can't believe she is only 20 years old. If you're not already keen on her, definitely put her on your radar. We'll be seeing a lot from her in the future. Michael Cera, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner, J.K. Simmons, Olivia Thirlby, and Allison Janney round out the cast and are fantastic. Simmons and Janney especially shine as Juno's father and step-mother.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also great. Kimya Dawson of the Moldy Peaches did a lot of the soundtrack which really sets the mood and pace of the film quite well. In addition to Dawson's track's there are also some great tunes from Belle & Sebastian, Cat Power, and The Velvet Underground.<br/><br/>After this viewing I would definitely have to say that Juno is on my short list for best films of 2007. It's a comedy with a lot of heart and enjoyable quirks. Folks seem to be comparing it to Napoleon Dynamite quite a bit. This is understandable due to the ""feel"" of the movie but as far as story and characterization goes I think there is a lot more substance. Definitely check it out when it hits theaters or check out one of the many screenings offered across the country.<br/><br/><ul><li>brendoman, Junoverse ID 1522</li></ul>"

","After reading the highly rated reviews of several movie critics, plus the recommendation of my astute daughter, I looked forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this movie. During the first 30 minutes I was thoroughly bored to the point where I was prepared to leave the theater. My wife restrained me and convinced me to see the movie out.<br/><br/>Admittedly the movie was marginally better during the next hour, but overall I was very disappointed with this simplistic movie, which favors an audience of teenage girls. The lead actress performed her role well, but her dialog consisted of constant flippant remarks, akin to a comedic late night talk show host. I fail to understand how so many professional movie critics can rave about this movie."
"GuyCaballero","3","27","57","8 May 2008"," Too self-conscious
","I wouldn't say it's a bad movie, but the screenplay is too distracting to be a good one. It's constantly drawing attention to itself through its quippy vernacular and pop-culture references, some of which were extremely awkward and contrived (""home skillet""? ""Thundercats""? ""Soupy Sales""? Please). I never once fell into the story, since the screenwriter insisted on reminding me that I was watching a cool, hip, funny movie.<br/><br/>I also thought the treatment of Jason Bateman's character was highly flawed. The first couple of times we see him with Juno, we get the very sense that he's interacting with her in a way that's inappropriate. He's subtly playing with her emotions to gratify his own ego, and that's worth discussing. But then, when they meet a final time, he all but propositions her -- a sixteen-year-old pregnant girl. I thought this flattened his character; previously an interesting study of a late-thirties suburban male, now he's just a lecherous villain that we can safely boo off the screen. This was a cop-out, in my opinion, as much of this movie was. They weren't interested in examining difficult decisions and emotions; all they wanted was for us to bask in their hip, progressive insight."
"diand_","4","26","55","24 January 2008"," Premature birth and death
","This is much praised for its unusual approach to the abortion debate combined with its overall cuteness. And although it certainly entertains at a basic level, there is not much more to this than an ordinary girl-loves-boy story combined with a well-off couple with problems and an endearing mom and dad.<br/><br/>I may disagree with most of you but for director Jason Reitman, whose timing in comedies is exceptional whereby he far surpasses his father, this is a step down compared to Thank You For Smoking. And although all actors try to make the most of this material (especially Ellen Page, in a very good performance comparable in likability to McDormand in Fargo), it is the critically acclaimed writing I had the most problems with.<br/><br/>Screen writing requires so much more a professional attitude and commitment than ordinary writing. Unfortunately, Diablo Cody is largely inexperienced and also not overly gifted as a screen writer. I observed several serious problems: The story is not very well structured, the characters are too one-dimensional and cardboard (take Juno's father, a painful one-dimensional role) and the script contains only a very small amount of instances where the lines themselves are above average. A comedy script has to be tightly written, with every line hitting you and being part of a larger construction where everything fits in and tightens itself around the main story (American Beauty comes to mind).<br/><br/>My guess is it is again that time of year where Hollywood needs a new (writing) star on the rise. And her personal story is more fascinating than this one. So I predict that in a few years time no one will talk about Juno or Cody.<br/><br/>...and for the so-called American indie culture: That died several years ago and was fully absorbed in the Hollywood mainstream. Just for marketing purposes the label is still useful."

It's hard to say that how little cost they spent shouldn't affect the determination of the value of the movie, but... if a movie has valued almost only because of not spending much money... that could also be a little bit ridiculous. I don't mean this movie doesn't have any plot or everything, but the fact that this movie got more than 100mil B.O. would've been mainly affected by this movie's Independent movie kinda feel. That's very interesting. Very clever marketing. I saw this movie's ad really many times on TV. Maybe they spent more for marketing than producing this.

","8/10 - a strange mix between happy and depressing moments, but it all fit together quite well in the end"
"CinematicInceptions","8","2","2","24 June 2016"," Refreshing
","This was surprisingly heavy for what was advertised as a rather light-hearted comedy. Yes, there are jokes made concerning Juno's pregnancy, but the situation itself is treated quite seriously by the characters. Juno's sarcasm is present in all of her dialogue regardless of mood, but it doesn't detract from the weight of certain scenes. A lot of Juno's sarcastic lines are of the tongue-in-cheek sort, making you smile rather than laugh out loud.<br/><br/>Of course, Diablo Cody's script is what always gets highlighted when discussing this movie. I must agree that it is a very well done script. The dialogue is really solid, even Juno's voice-over. The pace is nothing special, but the character intro for Vanessa was really something special. What I especially liked, though, was the portrayal of all the characters. It was great that all of them were treated with respect as people and had good and bad aspects to them. Bleaker is a possible exception to this, but he is an antagonist to Juno at a couple of points, also you might say that he does not take an active enough part in the pregnancy. However, the writing of Juno's parents was nice because this was the sort of movie that you might expect to portray all adults as total morons, but it doesn't. They can be stupid and misunderstanding, but no more or less than Juno herself is.<br/><br/>I think a subtle point that is made throughout is that experience is the best teacher. This theme comes up with the contrast between Juno and Vanessa. In a lot of ways, Juno is more prepared to be a parent than Vanessa is because she has to go through the unique hardships of her pregnancy, while Vanessa's only preparation is her precious little parenting books and magazines and off-yellow paint. Her overly-romanticized view of parenting has made her oblivious to how hard it actually is. Now, I'm not a parent myself, but I've seen enough parenting strategies to know that it's a frantic, difficult, and sometimes thankless job. Perhaps, this fact is part of Mark's motivation to ultimately SPOILERS leave Vanessa.<br/><br/>The acting is awesome from every part, big and small. Nobody is portrayed stereotypically, apart from maybe the Chinese girl outside of the abortion clinic. But that stereotype at least makes sense because it's not aimed at Asians, but rather adopted Chinese girls who could have been aborted. Plus, she proves to be pivotal in Juno's decision to go through with having the baby. The camera-work and other directing points are mostly unremarkable, but I got really annoyed by the music score. It fits the mood and everything, but it sounds like they're playing the same song with only three different chords the entire movie.<br/><br/>If you like any of the actors in this, it will be enjoyable. If the style doesn't appeal to you after about fifteen minutes, it's not worth continuing. But I would expect most casual viewers to enjoy it. It's emotional and genuinely funny and not in an annoyingly cute way. Aside from that it's a pretty impressive filmmaking achievement. Overall Rating: 8.2/10"
"oOoBarracuda","9","2","2","1 June 2016"," Juno
","Diablo Cody penned an insanely well-written story of a sixteen-year- old individualist who becomes pregnant with her friend/crush in her 2007 film Juno. Directed by Jason Reitman and starring Ellen Page, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman; Juno is fantastically crafted with enough pop culture references to place it until the end of time. The uniqueness of each person is fostered and treasured through Juno, going to show that if you can find that one person to make you feel comfortable with being you, do whatever you can to be with them. <br/><br/>After becoming pregnant with her best friend's baby, Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is unable to go through with an abortion, so she begins seeking an adoptive family for her baby. After meeting with prospective parents Vanessa Loring (Jennifer Garner) and Mark Loring (Jason Bateman), the ""Pennysaver Loring's"" Juno is convinced this is the family to raise her child. Over the course of her pregnancy, outlined by the changing Minnesota seasons which surround her, Juno grows close to Mark a commercial composer who is adjusting to prospective parenthood at a much slower rate than his eager wife Vanessa. Mark takes the opportunity of Juno's company to indulge in some of his interests and hobbies that had been suppressed since his marriage. The more he listens to his old music and plays music, the more hesitant he is to tie himself down and father a child. The changes in Mark and Vanessa's relationship becomes difficult for the two of them to handle. Juno's many changes create difficulty in her life as well, as she watches her friends enjoy prom and high school life, oblivious to the adult issues Juno must face as a pregnant teenager. Each person has been injected into the lives of those around them for a purpose, and it is up to each of them to find that purpose and grow through the transformation thrust upon them. <br/><br/>The opening scene showing where it all started, with a chair, instantly shows the audience what type of film they will be in for. Then, the opening credits shown through animation create a beautiful glimpse into the type of moving art placed before the audience. One can see after the first 10 minutes of the film that its shining star is its script. Not enough good can be said about Diablo Cody's witty pop culture laden beauty of a screenplay. Juno is a fantastic ensemble piece that is so much better, by the way, now that I have had more exposure to the supporting cast. Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons are incredible standouts in the film, even more now that I have enjoyed Janney in The West Wing and Simmons in Whiplash. The music and wardrobe in this film are top notch and fit with the realism of Juno's world perfectly. A movie centered around pregnancy is perfectly outlined by the changing seasons, an excellent decision on the part of director Jason Reitman. But not only Juno was changing, Mark was also going through changing seasons of his life as he was intimidated to let go of his past, and Vanessa as she was looking forward to spring into motherhood. An exceptional and underrated film, Juno is just as good 8 years removed from its release as it was the night I saw it in theaters. <br/><br/>Motherhood comes in many forms. Juno knew she was ""ill-equipped"" to become a mother at the stage in her life when she became pregnant. She also knew that since she was unable to go through with an abortion that she could bless the life of another with her baby. In the least sentimental way possible, Juno traverses the struggles of unplanned teenage pregnancy. Vanessa's supreme wish in life is to become pregnant when she is unable to, and after a failed previous attempt at adoption due to Mark's ""cold feet"", Vanessa is more determined than ever to become a mother. The conclusion of the film with Juno reflecting upon the notion that Vanessa was always the mother of her child was strikingly powerful, proving that motherhood s not exclusive to those that give birth."
"Quetzalcoatlus","5","32","71","23 February 2008"," A thoroughly mediocre experience.
","Let me make this clear. Juno is not a particularly bad movie. That being said, it's not a very good one, either.<br/><br/>To its credit, Juno does handle the sensitive issue of female pregnancy very tastefully. Unfortunately, that alone cannot save the movie from itself.<br/><br/>The film tries very hard to make the character of Juno into a quirky, offbeat-yet-lovable girl (a sort of American and pregnant version of Amélie Poulain, if you will). However, it fails miserably. Juno really just seems like a normal girl, but because of all of the stupid hipster slang they give her, she really just seems like a normal girl who's trying to be ""unique."" Juno and the father of her child have no chemistry whatsoever between them, which makes any contact between the two look forced and awkward.<br/><br/>The dialog in the movie is not nearly as funny as I expected it to be. True, there are some clever lines, but nothing is laugh-out-loud funny. I might have cracked a smile at one, but that's about it.<br/><br/>The pacing in the movie is overly slow, which is not helped by a pointless, almost five-minute last scene where we watch Juno and her baby's daddy play guitar and look at each other. If the movie had really been as funny as everyone said it would be, it probably wouldn't have seemed as slow.<br/><br/>As I said before, it's not an awful movie by any means, but it's not nearly as good as the hype says it is, and mostly forgettable. There are many other genuinely good movies out in theaters now, all of which are a better choice than this one."

","Juno is not the feel-good movie of the season, as was stated by several reviewers, but rather a dramedy that left a bitter taste in my mouth as I left the theater. Though some reviewers commented on the realism and the witty dialog, I find both to only be partially true. As a teenager, I can assure you that the dialog is not quite a true mirror of the language of today's teenagers, but that is not what truly bugged me.It is It is the way the movie constantly switches horses in midstream. It is lost between a drama and a comedy, and there is a distinct style between the parts of the movie which are wrought as comedy, and the other parts of drama. The drama is quite different from mainstream drama, and is the only thing keeping the movie alive (I thoroughly hate Hollywood drama, and this is what kept me in the theater). However, it is the comedy which leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It is a movie at which I felt a desire to feel sorry for Juno, but in which the comedy simply destroys all of this, and shows Juno as a heartless piece of wood. No 16 year old could ever deal with a situation as serious as hers, with the indifference she does. She makes a mockery of a situation that is destined to be serious, but ends up becoming a sick joke in the eye of the beholder. Additionally, as a teenage boy, I am very insulted and disgusted at our society for laughing at a subject as serious as this. Though I am not opposed to satire, and find it very enjoyable, I simply cannot laugh at as serious a topic as this, in a movie which seems to stress the seriousness one second, and throws it off as a canned, (yet still somewhat quirky) remark the next."

","When I first heard about this little film I wasn't particularly interested. Being a high school teacher, I wasn't impressed with the idea of seeing a movie concerning a teenage mother. Believe me, I know enough of them already! However, on a lark, I decided to finally watch the film--almost two years after it debuted. And, in hindsight, I should have just gone and seen the film when it came out, as unlike my ASSUMPTION, it was not really a glorification of teen pregnancy but a very complex film--a film with a lot of different messages and possible interpretations. This is definitely NOT a by-the-numbers (formulaic) film--there is a lot that is original and new. And, if you were worried that the film would be pro-teen pregnancy or abortion or whatever and it might offend you, don't think that way....the film is great for anyone, conservative or liberal alike. And, it might just be an excellent film for you to see with your teens. Excellent, simple and very effective.<br/><br/>I could say a lot more about the film, but considering the huge number of reviews already and the film came out some time back, I'll be brief and stop here."

I guess, as many hated it reviewer had already pointed out, it's kinda superficial. And even we're shouting for some openness for parents about their teenagers' ""accident"" pregnancy(but as the step mom character pointed out she thought her step-daughter knew it""), the message it send out is not right. I'm not a religious person, and not a parent. But call me old-fashioned, the way Juno handled her accident pregnancy is so casual, she isn't sorry, and it seems there's no different to her vomited in the vase.<br/><br/>The Juno character acts beyond her age, but it's kinda annoying for me to see her talking like that, especially at the first scene in Mark & Vanessa's house. Maybe nowadays teenagers are like this, I don't know, and I'm not even living in the States. Part of it maybe I knew Ellen is already 20 and playing a 16 year-old character, and sometimes she acted like a cynical 30-something.<br/><br/>You just can't take this movie seriously, treat it like comic/cartoon/sci-fi, whatever you called it, just as those cartoons when a guy ran over by a car and become paper-thin, then pump himself up again. <br/><br/>And this is the best original script for the Oscars?!! <br/><br/>Btw, I still like the music in the movie, the music are indie? I don't know, I've never heard of most of the artists in the soundtrack but I've been listening to Belle and Sebastien(with 2 songs in the OST) for a few years, so I like the music, and it's about one's music taste, nothing related to the movie.

","Reading the reviews here, I've noticed that a lot of people don't like ""Juno"" so much. Now if Juno (the character) could be aware of this--well, she wouldn't care. That's what I love about her. She really doesn't care what anyone thinks. She simply speaks her mind, and what a delightful, snarky little mind it is.<br/><br/>People have complained about the unrealistic dialogue in ""Juno,"" that it's too witty to portray teenagers accurately. When I think of realistic teenage dialogue, my mind travels back to high school art class, where I sat in front of two freshmen who spent every class period calling each other various curse words and shouting, ""You killed Kenny!"" every couple minutes or so. That is realistic dialogue. Is it what I want to hear? Of course not; I'd rather be amused.<br/><br/>""Juno"" isn't a slice-of-life movie, but purely comedic. If I had wanted a more realistic movie about teenage pregnancy, I would have watched the next dreary sob story on Lifetime, where perhaps the lead character might toss her baby into a dumpster. Instead I watched this. Who knew that a movie about a pregnant teenager could be so uplifting? As a feel-good movie it worked for me, because I definitely felt good afterward.<br/><br/>I saw Juno as a strong character, the type of person who wants to know and experience everything life has to offer, much like Diablo Cody herself. As a result she possesses an incredible knowledge of pop culture, but also ends up pregnant. Was that foolish? Sure it was, but Juno wisely turns the pregnancy into something very positive. The point of this is not that teenage pregnancy is a wonderful thing, but that lamenting our mistakes is a waste of time, as mistakes are a part of life; and sometimes, as in the case of Juno, they can serve to make life a richer experience, for ourselves as well as for others.<br/><br/>""Juno"" is the cinematic equivalent of pie. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. You never eat pie for its nutritional value but simply to indulge yourself once in a while. If I had wanted the cinematic equivalent of steak I would have watched something else. Yes, ""Juno"" is sugary and sweet. But those are the qualities you would look for in a pie, and as pie ""Juno"" is very, very good."

Yes, I've seen worse, much worse, hence the four stars which simply means I can understand how it made it to cinema. 4 out of 10 is still an ""F"" in my book, so I'm definitely calling Juno a failure.<br/><br/>The great shame is that it had so much potential. None of the actors are bad, the subject is great, and there's even a nice bit of resolution at the end of the plot. What's bad about Juno is everything else; direction, dialogue, delivery.<br/><br/>Juno sounds like an endless loop of smart-ass wisecracks cut from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" mixed with incomprehensible and pointless pop culture references, played at twice the speed and made a dozen times ruder. The result is too embarrassing to laugh at, an amazing morass of mindlessness trying to make a movie out of relentless verbosity alone.<br/><br/>Juno, the protagonist, very quickly alienates us with her in-charge-of-the-world witticism when we need to see just a touch of vulnerability to empathize with her character. Unfortunately, there's no other character stepping out on stage to be an alternate protagonist, and very quickly, we cease to care about what happens to anyone, and the hope that it gets any better becomes the sole reason to endure it.<br/><br/>Most lines are played for laughs, many of them solely for cheap shock value, but hardly any deliver. (The only one that made me laugh was when the adoptive father tells Juno that his music is ""more commercial."" ""What do you write?"" asks Juno. ""Commercials,"" he answers.) <br/><br/>Paulie Bleeker, the father of Juno's baby, is cast as the ultimate dork, and made to constantly look ridiculous. It's unclear if the goal was to try to out-Napoleon Dynamite ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" or to underscore just how naive and unready for parenthood he is. No matter, though, because he actually only appears in a handful of scenes.<br/><br/>And the ""tender"" moments are marred by absurd lyrics sung off-key over acoustic guitar by the teenage stars themselves. The aim was almost certainly to bring authenticity and ""realism,"" but no matter how realistic it is to hear kids singing lines like ""if you were a floor, I'd be a rug,"" it's still a crime to be inflicted with that when some inconspicuous mood music is called for. It does get better in the last few minutes, but it's far too little, too late.<br/><br/>And just how the hell did the ""experts"" in the Academy decide this was the BEST original screenplay? ""Adequate"" itself would be debatable, but the BEST? Please, please, explain that to me!"
"jrappa1-1","1","16","33","14 April 2008"," Shallow pandering to the crowd
","This movie pretty much just tries to go along with the ""indie"" look of teen films nowadays. It's almost like the John Hughes craze of the 80s, only John Hughes wised up to his cliché image and eventually made the Home Alone series.<br/><br/>It starts with the same crappy image as Napoleon Dynamite and other such popular movies that have no dimension to their characters. The credits look like something that came out of a high school student's notebook doodlings, just as in Napoleon Dynamite, a style that I find cheap and disposable. The music sucks, but audiences like it because it's ""trendy."" The music lacks any talent or creativity, as it's usually just a lone guitar with some guy singing in a high-pitched voice. Wow, you're a deep individual, because you can sing in a funny voice and strum three chords! And then there's the script. It sucks. Every single line out of Juno's mouth is overly rehearsed and is uttered solely for the sake of looking ""cool."" I say that because the lines usually don't make any sense, and certainly aren't funny or even entertaining. ""He is the cheese to my macaroni."" Oh wow, that's so hilarious! No wonder why you got an Oscar! The girl is a fan of 1970's rock (just like every other high school student in America), old horror movies (just like every other high school student in America), and makes a conscious effort to be witty with every comment she makes (just like every other high school student in America). Oh yeah, she's a unique free spirit, alright. A unique free spirit who conforms to everyone else in this subculture.<br/><br/>So if it's on TV, go ahead and watch it. But I certainly wouldn't pay half a penny for it."
"nonowto","5","30","69","4 January 2008"," It was an iffy movie
","Really, Juno is hyped up way beyond what it should be. I understand that all the indie kids will love it but, really, I've seen a lot better movies. I think it's good in the fact that the moral of the story is cool (not aborting a baby & actually giving it up for adoption) but the problem with the writer is this: #1 the target market for this film is under 17, therefore making it a PG-13 rating. The problem with this doesn't add the same intensity as if it happened in real life. It's a good try but really doesn't have a lot of realism in it, even though that's one of the main things Juno is supposed to be.<br/><br/>#2 it really hurts the scripts jokes. I honestly can say that the jokes had a lot of potential and would've really been funny but due to the pg-13 rating they just weren't as funny as they could be. The witty-ness was there but the corniness is just really pathetic.<br/><br/>#3 It tried way too hard to relate to the younger generation. Like I said, the target market for this film was under 17, even though a lot of older people enjoyed it to. It really pushed itself to relate to the younger generation and the things this generation says and things like that.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a decent movie but the script & Ellen Page could've been better. Directing was pretty good and the style of the movie was good. I have to admit, the music really relates to this younger generation. So, go see the movie, and I am sure most people disagree with me, but it's not worth buying to me."

","This film is about a supposedly clever and responsible sixteen year old girl named Juno who's (astonishingly) surprised to find she's pregnant after having unprotected sex and how the decisions she makes from then on affect her and the lives of those around her, notably the person she slept with, her parents and a couple eager to adopt her baby.<br/><br/>I'll start by saying that I really can't understand why some people heap praise on Juno. Teenage pregnancy, planned or not, wanted or not, is not a new and out there subject matter for TV and film. It's been convincingly done many, many times before and being unrealistic is the main problem here. I'm guessing the success this film has had is almost exclusively down to some impressionable young girls wishing they could have Juno's characteristics in real life.<br/><br/>Before I even get to her pregnancy, I must point out that Juno's language comes across as scripted and false, her personality is like that you'd expect from a US sitcom trying to be smart and hip and her knowledge on certain subjects is akin to someone at least ten years her senior. Combined, these things get very distracting and between them writer Diablo Cody, director Jason Reitman and actress Ellen Page (through no fault of her own) really sour the film. Why do US teenagers have to be portrayed by older people in film and TV, seen to be far more grown up than you'd expect from their age bracket? Why must US 'burb kids always be heard needlessly using words such as ""like"", whatever"" and ""dude"" in normal day to day conversation? Certainly not something you'd expect from a typical sixteen year old girl (even one who declares herself to be ""one of those freaky girls"").<br/><br/>Moving on to Juno's pregnancy then, there are a number of things I just can't believe are handled so irresponsibly. For example, I find it incredible that taking precautions before having sex is barely even mentioned by anyone at any time throughout the film! Also, Juno tells the father she's pregnant and, before he's even had time for things to sink in, she's contently on her way making all the big decisions by herself in a totally carefree manner! In fact, almost everyone involved (exceptions being Jennifer Garner's and Jason Bateman's characters) behave exactly how everyday, civilised people wouldn't. Juno's father takes the news of her pregnancy unbelievably well! His sixteen year old daughter has a bun in the oven and he reacts as if she's just insisted upon painting her bedroom black! Any self respecting dad would have yelled her ears off, demanding to know who the father is! What kind of people do we have here? Certainly not normal.<br/><br/>I'm not exaggerating when I say that, according to this film, abortion and adoption seem to be the only options available to a modern day, pregnant teenager. Actually keeping the child hardly gets a mention and is quickly brushed aside. There's plenty more wrong I could mention but these would border on being spoilers so I'll leave it to unfortunate viewers to pick up on things for themselves.<br/><br/>If I could claim back the wasted 96 minutes of my life, I would! This slowly paced film is middle of the road at best and certainly not worthy of such a high rating and ranking on IMDb or the numerous nominations and awards it's received. I'd even go so far as to say that the film is inappropriate for adolescent girls as the subject matter is handled very irresponsibly, both in front of the camera and behind it."

","OK, I have no idea why so many people believe this movie to be so great, entertaining, or even relevant. I found it to be a bore, the acting to be so subtle that you really feel drained by the slow, drawn out vocabulary most people seem to speak. I will admit, I have never cared for movies like this but took the reviews to mean this movie was something special and considering it stars the kid from ""Superbad"" I was hoping ti would be funny but, sadly, it was only comedic in the same way that New York street mimes are. Think about it for a minute. I only gave it 3 stars because the female lead is sort of attractive though she is a self absorbed, mentally incapacitated, spoiled little brat with the vocabulary of Janeen Garofalo and the voice of Napolean Dynamite. I guess the entire thing can be summed up with the words ""Who acts like that ?"" I didn't make it through to the end, I had my fill and went on to better things but am hoping it ended with a joyous suicide or something. From the way the character acted and thought, it is very apparent that the character would end up dead one day anyways."

","I will try to explain what is wrong with this movie without spoiling any of it. It's not that it was a *bad* movie, it's just mediocre. How it could possibly win an award, I have no idea.<br/><br/>The movie centers around a quirky 16-year-old girl who gets pregnant and has to decide what to do with the baby. She is supposedly one of those ""cool, laid-back, alternative chicks"" who, as a consequence of being so cool, also has a bitchy attitude. Unfortunately, not only does her character not look the part, but her speech is completely wrong. Whoever wrote the dialog obviously hasn't been in high school for a long time; they mixed slang from various generations and various social groups who rarely borrow words from each other. Additionally, Ellen Page appears to be rather uncomfortable using this type of language. Most other aspects of the high school social scene were also misrepresented.<br/><br/>And the ""alternative chick who likes horror movies and only listens to unpopular music because it's unpopular"" cliché is too fake and played out.<br/><br/>The plot doesn't seem to have been thought out too well, either. Often it seems a character's unrealistic behavior is only to facilitate plot development. Most of the characters just don't act/react in a believable fashion. And what is up with Cera's practically autistic character? He hardly speaks at all in the movie, yet is a very important character. And these two are supposed to be best friends, yet they rarely talk (the only way I knew they were best friends was because they came right out and said it).<br/><br/>Aside from the completely unrealistic characters and the shaky plot, the movie was pretty much just boring. I found myself waiting for something interesting to happen through most of the movie. It is supposed to be a comedy and yet I only laughed a few times through it. Really, it's a drama."
"michaelRokeefe","10","10","19","20 April 2008"," Outstanding as it is wonderful!
","This is one of those no-miss movies you'll regret failing to watch. The mood is light for such heavy subject matter. Juno MacGuff(Ellen Page)is a witty, confident, cool and quirky teen that finds herself taking on an unplanned pregnancy. Her boyfriend Paulie(Michael Cera)is all but unassuming. Her father Mac(J.K. Simmons)is more understanding than her no-nonsense stepmom Bren(Allison Janney). The smart-as-a-whip Juno decides to search for the 'perfect' couple to adopt her baby. An affluent couple(Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman)wanting to adopt may not be the perfect choice they seem. Juno knows her own limitations and she is starting to find out who she really is...and what she wants. Kudos to director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody. Page is totally wonderful; I've loved her since HARD CANDY(2005). Also in the cast: Olivia Thirlby, Rainn Wilson and Darla Vandenbossche."
"jcbcritique","2","67","174","4 May 2008"," Weak Dialogue, Overcooked Performance from Page
","For all of its arm-waving, panting dialogue, and (mildly) controversial subject-matter, the adjective that springs to mind is ""forgettable."" First of all, Ellen Page, in full Janeane Garofalo mode, is not terribly likable in the title role. The pixie-haired angel of death from ""Hard Candy"" was an easier sell for an actress of Page's physical type and emotional brittleness. She tries to compensate for this with over-delivery of lines, and exaggerated facial expressions.<br/><br/>But before too much of the fault is laid on Page, the awfulness of the dialogue must be admitted. It pleads, rolls around on the floor, and kicks its heels for attention, and worse than this, it becomes fairly predictable about fifteen minutes in. At about the halfway mark, I found myself guessing the punchlines to jokes before the actors could deliver them. Case in point; when the pregnant Juno first meets prospective adopters Bateman and Garner, and is offered a drink, I actually said aloud, ""She's going to ask for alcohol."" Of course, Juno asks for a Maker's Mark. But in a cute-fest of PG-13 proportions, of course, she immediately corrects herself to a juice (or maybe a soda).<br/><br/>In sum, then, the dialogue is the principal undoing of this film -- no amount of decent acting (which is not entirely absent) can save it. Honorable mentions, therefore, for Alison Janney and J.K. Simmons in largely thankless and under-written roles as Juno's parents. Justin Bateman, usually a sly comic actor, here seems unable to find the via media between harmless unction and dangerous sleaziness. Jennifer Garner phones her performance in, and to be honest, probably not much more could be expected of someone like her. <br/><br/>Michael Cera, out-hammed by Page in every scene he appears, may or may not be good. It's impossible to tell."

Every moment just tries too hard at being iconic. It's just full of it. <br/><br/>None of the characters seem very convincing, none of their emotions ring true.

","Normally, there is always one film each year that not only do I think is overrated by the critics, but is actually a BAD film.

The first half of the film had the most unrealistic, heightened dialog I had seen in a film since the ridiculous ""Brick"" of 2006.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the second half came back more to the plot, and I found it to be surprisingly sweet at the end, and it salvaged the film for me.<br/><br/>I also find it interesting that as I write this review, the majority of negative user comments are more recent.

","Premise: Teenage girl gets pregnant and learns about life and relationships with her new ""status."" Significance: Anyone calling this a movie about teenage pregnancy has completely missed the point of the movie. The pregnancy is nothing more than a vehicle to provide an important contrast across several different relationships. Case in point: there is not one moment in the movie where Juno evaluates or considers her pregnancy. As such, those looking for a pro-life/pro-choice agenda in the movie will not find one -- because there isn't one.<br/><br/>Similarly, while the protagonist is clearly an intelligent, sharp-witted, and proactive, young female -- leaving some to believe this movie has a feminist agenda -- that is also not the case. This would not even be discussed if it were a male lead. Moreover, Juno by the end sees that she needs both her Dad and her best friend, Pauly. Most importantly, the career-driven adoptive mother's struggle is that despite her career success, her life is dominated by wanting to be a mom -- clearly not a feminist point.<br/><br/>Instead, the movie highlights that people and relationships are not always what they seem. Through the story, the heroine realizes that her best friend is someone she loves. She realizes that her quirky and off-beat Dad and step-mom, are actually ""good"" people. The adoptive parents have the biggest character change in the movie, with the soon-to-be Dad swinging from hip to shallow and selfish, while the soon-to-be-mom swings from cold to warm and loving.<br/><br/>Boiled down, this is a simple, feel-good, love story. The heroine realizes that her best friend, whom she has taken for granted, is someone she loves. Overlayed on this simple, heart-warming and timeless story (you realize you always had what you thought you were missing) is witty dialog and significant character development -- providing much more depth then the typical teen comedy -- like ""Knocked-Up"" or ""Napoleon Dynamite"". In fact, this is one of the best movies of the year and probably one of the best comedies to come in years.<br/><br/>With this movie, Jason Reitman has established himself as one of the great young directors in Hollywood. Diablo Cody has also seen meteoric rise in her stock, although it will be interesting to see how she follows up with such immediate initial success. Every life probably has one good movie in it. And Ms. Cody apparently borrowed heavily from her own life in creating Juno. As such, her next endeavor will be crucial for determining if she is a ""one-hit"" wonder or one of the next great screenwriters."

Every thing about this movie is trying oh so hard to be kooky, different and clever. It isn't. Some technical aspects of the movie were competent, there were no boom shots and it stayed in sync. That's the positives, so my review is now balanced. The lead actress looks thirty, that may sound like a nasty personal comment but considering she's playing 14 or 15 i think its valid. The characters are so twee and fake i could never see them as real and the dialogue was painfully forced. I managed to stay with the movie for about twenty minutes until i wanted to beat my head repeatedly off the wall. This movie reminded me a little of my own teenage years, you know those really annoying kids who act all cool and alternative but behind it are ultra normal and conservative and study really hard.

","I went to see ""Juno"" expecting a quirky comedy-drama about an unplanned teen pregnancy, but what I saw left me dumbfounded. This movie isn't just quirky; it's quirky to the nth degree. It quickly became apparent that ""Juno"" was not meant to be a ""realistic"" movie about a painful subject leavened by humor; instead, it's a film in which most of the main characters seem to be in some kind of competition to see who can spout the highest number of wisecracks in the shortest amount of time. Basically, it's a sitcom on steroids.<br/><br/>In this movie, Juno MacGuff is a 16-year-old girl living in Minnesota who discovers she's pregnant a few months after a one-night stand with a close friend (not exactly boyfriend) named Paulie. She contemplates getting an abortion, but ends up deciding to give the baby away to a well-to-do young couple named Mark and Vanessa.<br/><br/>The film gets off to an ominous start as Juno returns to a convenience store to give herself a pregnancy test for the third time in the same day. When she enters the store, the young man behind the counter calls out, ""Well, well - if it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?"" Juno says, ""I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign. I remain unconvinced."" The young man replies, ""This is your third test today, Mama Bear. Your Eggo is preggo, no doubt about it."" After Juno tests herself again, and the result is again positive, she shakes the tester, prompting the clerk to remark, ""That ain't no Etch-a- Sketch. This is one doodle that can't be un-did, Homeskillet.""<br/><br/>It's a fairly jaw-dropping scene, what with all the forced hostility-laced banter, but then comes the real shocker: 90 percent of the entire movie's dialogue is like this. Juno and Paulie may have lost their virginity, and their innocence, but they and their friends are never, ever at a loss for words. Even Juno's father gets into the act; told about his daughter's pregnancy, he muses about being a grandfather - or, as he puts it, a ""pop-pop."" Later, when Vanessa asks a visibly upset Juno why she's crying, the distraught girl, without missing a beat, tells her, ""I'm not crying, I'm just allergic to fine home furnishing."" (Oy, vey.)<br/><br/>Juno is meant to be a smart, sassy girl who marches to her own drummer. She's also filled with a ton of pop culture references, both past and present. A lot of people have jumped on the fact that at one point, Juno sarcastically describes a female classmate as looking like ""Soupy Sales."" These critics wonder how a 16-year-old in this day and age would know who Soupy Sales is; others defend the reference, saying it shows how eclectic Juno's tastes are. My feeling is: Even if she knows who Soupy Sales, White Fang and Black Tooth were, what about the friend she's talking to?<br/><br/>Just as dishonest as the implausibly snappy, mile-a-minute dialogue is the way ""Juno"" treats the subject of teen pregnancy, making it seem like a minor inconvenience. We're supposed to believe Juno is so self-assured and resourceful, she never once displays panic over her situation; telling her father and stepmother turns out to be no big deal, either.<br/><br/>Ellen Page is a charming Juno, even if she's overstuffed with too-clever-by-half one-liners. I liked Jennifer Garner as the very nice, if slightly dense, Vanessa, and Jason Bateman is just right as her husband, Mark. Veteran TV performers J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney are also welcome as Juno's parents, despite some of the dialogue they're required to speak.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, the film is glib, IMHO. Not just because of the way it lightly treats teenage pregnancy, but also because I didn't feel the least bit enlightened by it. I came away from ""Juno"" without the slightest new insight into current attitudes, or today's kids. As a middle- aged person who *does* remember Soupy Sales, I'm wondering how teenagers are reacting to this film. Do they listen to the hyped-up dialogue and think that it's only a mildly exaggerated form of today's kidspeak, one they wish they were better at? Or do they shake their heads and think, ""Nobody I know talks like that!""?"

","Like a reviewer said earlier I am one of those people who ""did not crack a smile once"" during the whole movie. Not to say that I disliked the actors in the film, I think they did pretty well with what they had to work with. I understand this is kind of a quirky movie, but being quirky is not an allowance to be unrealistic. I think the script was awful. Character reaction to a relatively serious situation was completely off the wall and unbelievable. I got the impression that if Juno had forgotten to do a homework assignment for school she would have been in more trouble than getting herself pregnant. Technically the editing was beyond atrocious, some of the cuts from scene to scene looked like they were scotch taped together randomly, with numerous shots serving zero purpose whatsoever. To think this was nominated for an academy award is laughable. If you want to see what a quirky independent film should really look like check out Rushmore or Little Miss Sunshine, those films are far superior to this farce."

","I didn't know what all the hype was about and some friends recommended 'Juno'. Thus, I finally watched it yesterday. While I agree with some that it is slightly over-hyped, I liked it as it was a very pleasant watch. However, my only problem is that a lot of the themes are a bit too sugarcoated and slightly a bit too manipulative. I liked how Juno is shown as this selfish, self-centred, careless teen who gradually grows into a caring and considerate person. Cody's writing is solid but while this film centres around Juno, the supporting characters could have been further developed and used a bit more focus (as I found them very interesting). The dialogues are noteworthy (most of the time) especially the clever one-liners. The film has a very young feel and the soundtrack adds to the youthfulness. Another strength of 'Juno' is its performances. Ellen Page acts well although, in the beginning, she does not look interested in the role (However, I don't think it's an award worthy performance as 2007 had stronger female leads). Moreover, Juno wasn't an easy role to play but Page does a decent job in the end. Michael Cera too does well as the tic-tac addict but one will recognize George-Michael Bluth from 'Arrested Development'. J.K. Simmons is fun to watch in a lighter role. Allison Janney is marvelous as the supportive and friendly step-mom. Jason Bateman is great as Mark the composer who, where through Juno, is reminded of himself at a younger age and the dreams he had. Jennifer Garner is likable in a different role. For me, 'Juno' was a nice fun movie but there were so many other films and performances that deserved more accolade. It's a great movie but not a masterpiece. But, anyway, the Oscars are overrated most of the time. It cleverly avoids cliché and melodrama but the issues that it deals with are handled a little too lightly. Nonetheless, it's a nice watch. Director Jason Reitman has made a movie that keeps a smile in the end."

","Juno, directed by Jason Reitman, is a quirky independent film that made it big in the mainstream. The title character, a sixteen year old girl, discovers that she is pregnant. After considering abortion, she decides that a closed adoption is the best way to go. She goes through her pregnancy and comes to terms with facts about relationships, and grows as a person before having the baby and giving it to the adoptive parents. It is a heartfelt movie, which I enjoyed very much. It does, however, raise several questions, and opens the door to several other topics. The direction that the film took was very open. It was not condemning towards teen pregnancy, abortion, or that adoption was the better solution to this situation. It came off that this was the right solution for Juno, not for everyone else. The non-judgmental and non-preaching aspects of the film made it really enjoyable, and allowed the audience to sit back and really absorb what was happening to the characters instead of being swayed one direction or the other. It allows the audience to make their own decisions on the topics. I was able to appreciate the story, instead of getting offended at films with agendas. This was refreshingly different. The scene in which Juno goes to the abortion clinic is, in my opinion, one of the most well done in the film. She is under the impression that she can get rid of her problem as easy and as quickly as a doctor's visit. She doesn't think too deeply about it until she runs into a classmate who tells Juno that fetuses have fingernails, and who is then unable to go through with her abortion. Juno realizes that it is not as simple a decision as she thought it was. I feel that this point is an important one to make. The filmmakers are not saying that abortion is wrong, they never condemn it. But there is a message that an abortion is not an easy solution to an unwanted pregnancy, and that it should really be thought through. While I found the girl at the counter unprofessional for a clinic, I feel that the scene was a success. Not everyone is a professional in places where they should be, and some places, like Juno's view of the abortion clinic, wind up being nothing like what we thought they would be. Of course, the most talked about and most apparent issue that the film creates is about teenage sex. I've also heard that this is one of the reasons why many people don't like the film. They do not like to think that teenagers are having sex, and see this film as glorifying the act. They would rather forget that this should be an issue on everyone's minds. Juno is clearly sexually activity, as evident by her condition, and she is not ostracized by her family or friends. They support her through a hard period of her life. She does not really suffer to any noticeable degree at her pregnancy, not is never really 'punished' for it.' I've seen many reviews that criticize the film for making Juno such a smart character, but then seeming to dumb her down by having unprotected sex. Maybe these reviewers are too far removed from their high school years. Most teenagers believe that they are indestructible, that nothing will hurt them, and I see this apply to Juno's view of how she got pregnant. If anything, I think this film advocates for better sex education to show teenagers that yes, this too can happen to them. It is a reality that many people are unwilling to face. I also enjoyed how the film dealt with relationships. Not all of them were happy, and none of them were perfect. I think this is much more realistic than what Hollywood usually portrays, and allows people to have better expectations of their own relationships. I especially liked Mark and Vanessa, who appeared to have the perfect life, but were perhaps the unhappiest out of everyone. I, too, did not know that fetuses have fingernails. It's an interesting thing to think about. I also had very little knowledge of any sort of adoption process, and I enjoyed seeing the process that Juno goes through with Vanessa and Mark, and the discussion of different types of adoptions. I think most people think of orphanages when they hear adoption, so it was nice to see another view. I would recommend this film for almost anyone. It was rather amusing, and I felt it was one of the more sincere movies that I have seen recently. While it did have several faults with continuity and so forth, as a whole, it worked as a story. Not only did I leave the theater smiling, it left me thinking about the important subjects that it brings up."

","Juno. A movie portrayed in the previews as being about a girl going through the decisions and difficulties of becoming pregnant is exactly what it was. I went and saw it because of the fantastic reviews it had received but wow they were a little misleading.<br/><br/>The actors and especially Ellen Page did a fantastic job with their characters, however, the parents although lovable at times were completely unrealistic about the whole issue. Not even a tear drop or a little yell which one would expect from the parents if they found out their child had become pregnant at the age of 16.<br/><br/>Overall the film, I thought, was funny and at times worth the price of admission, but to think the rating was a 9 and potentially up there with No Country for Old Men was completely misleading. It had humor at times and some touching scenes but was not some kind of remarkable masterpiece as people had portrayed it to be. One of my friends commented before seeing the movie, based on the previews, as being about, ""Some girl who gets pregnant and has to deal with the issues of it, doesn't seem interesting to me."" Unfortunately, he couldn't have summed it up any better. I gave it a 3 just to bring the 9 star rating down realistically I would give it a 6 or 7 just because the acting was there. The plot turned me away."

","Movies about quirky, off-beat characters have been a staple of American indie cinema for years. And lately one of them has been a fixture as filler Oscar nominee, usually snabbing Best Screenplay. But what makes Wes Anderson movies different from Punch-Drunk Love, and what makes those different from Little Miss Sunshine, Napoleon Dynamite and this year's Juno? Well it depends on the degree of sell-out quality which, in the script, translates into how much do the off-beat, quirky characters end up happily integrated into conformity. Little Miss Sunshine, for example, is an idiot's feel-good movie, about a bunch of subnormal losers ruining a girl's life, and finally getting their chance to shine in an extended candy-flavored, undeserved, overlong catharsis scene. I think Tim Burton is the most honest (ironically a Hollywood director) craftsman of this type of story - his characters are unapologetically weird and they never end up accepted and subdued by society under any circumstance.<br/><br/>Juno is about a so-called geek, sarcastic teenage girl that ends up pregnant after having sex with a meek, feminine looking boy she's secretly in love with. Unlike what might be expected from a lesser movie, her parents accept the burden with maturity and actually collaborate with their daughter in her goal of giving the child to adoption. In trying to find the perfect couple, Juno comes into contact with a pair of yuppies, played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. She's so crazy about having a child I'd never, ever in my life allow her to even touch one, while he lives mostly in the relics of his past, when he didn't have to hide his rock memorabilia and comic-books from view in a room, specially prepared by his wife for that purpose. Problem will not arise from conventional sources in this script, and that was one of the things that made me judge Juno above the type of garbage it definitively looks like from the ads and trailers. This is not the Little Miss Sunshine type - nothing will get so wrapped up by the end, neither can you see every scene coming from the first one onwards. Also, I gotta admit Ellen Page is an ugly-looking nothingness, but she's not without her acting chops.<br/><br/>And still, the Cody/Reitman team manages to fall into some of the independent director's traps. For example, in a movie written by a blogger, I guess it's to be expected that every character talks like they're press articles instead of people. This is not being intelligent, this is being annoying - if I knew someone who talked like this, I'd kick him/her on the genitalia. ""Honest to blog"", ""silencio!"", ""your eggo is preggo"" and other unneeded cutecisms populate every single line of dialogue. Every character is some kind of quirky pop culture savvy talking head. Of course, Juno is the worst - you're supposed to relate to her because she's covering a heart of gold under that stand-up comedy exterior. How come a cashier at an abortion clinic has her face covered by body piercing and cracks jokes at Juno's condition? Is that supposed to be so out of place it's funny? I see it more as overcrowding in a movie that's already bursting with forced oddity.<br/><br/>And still, the drama exhibits a level of maturity rarely seen in that colorful, rock-soundtrack sub-Hollywood that's ""edgy"" US film nowadays, most of it evident on the script's surprise development about the adoptive couple. Even though she's a psycho and he's an inmature dork, we understand both of them and the effect they have on Juno's already troubled mind. I also thought it was nice that Juno's parents weren't a couple of ogres. That her hero's journey has her saving the day by the end is predictable yet to an extent needed, but it brings to me another pet peeve - Juno has not in her one inch of the insecurity that's to be expected in any teenage girl, not only a knocked up one. That makes her a way too convenient protagonist and of course, smarter than everyone else around to an unrealistic extent.<br/><br/>I remain lukewarm on this one, although it's not a bad movie by any means. The soundtrack, the characters and the dialogue are annoying as all hell, but the actors really elevate the material (specially J.K. Simmons) and the script finds itself comfortable in that moral grey area where none is too perfect or too lousy a human being. I guess it's not good stuff either, but I can't bring myself to hate it 100%. I've seen far worse."

","I am highly offended that people would call this film ""revolutionary"", ""original"" or anything short of ""STOLEN"". Everyone made a big deal about how it was the first movie that dealt with teenage sex, teenage pregnancy, and there are plenty more but at the risk of spoiling it for those of you who have not seen this plagiarized work, I will leave that up to you. But whether you've seen it or not...I urge you to watch the Korean family comedy ""Jenny, Juno"" about two teenagers who have sex, get pregnant, and the rest is up for you to watch. Oh, and by the way, ""Jenny, Juno"" was a big hit in South Korea, came out almost 2 years prior to Diablo Cody's alleged ""original script"", and the entire story (minus the obvious pop-culture jokes from Juno being stolen from other movies) is exactly the same, minus the not so startling sub-plot. Nonetheless, you cannot take an entire story plagiarize it almost word for word, change one minor sub-plot detail and be given credit for ""originality"". If Diablo Cody had any decency in her she'd admit to her plagiarism, return the Oscar for ""Original"" Screenplay, and beg the South Koreans for forgiveness. If not, than all her work is to be labeled suspect."

","You already heard it before. It's way too pretentious. Juno, ""the know-it-all, too good for schoolm but dumb enough to get pregnant teenager"", is highly annoying. Every comment made by another character is subjected to a sarcastic, witty remark by our friend Juno. Which leads to forced, unrealistic dialouge disguised as wittiness. On the surface, this movie is simple. It's never challenging, though it tries to be. It's never smart or clever, though it tries to be. I can't think of one thing that makes this movie special or Oscar-worthy. Maybe Hollywood just really likes Ellen Page's face? It should be also noted that although the movie is centered around teen pregnancy, it fails to leave a point. Speaking of pointless, the indie theme of this movie should've been abolished. Same as the indie pop-culture references that were made after every 2-3 lines. After watching this movie for 20 minutes, one might want to punch a wall."

","I read the review by Isabelle1955, submitted on Jan 13, 2008. I agree with her completely. I do want to emphasize that I, too, was extremely uncomfortable by the cavalier way the people in the movie respond to the pregnancy. It is treated as an inconvenience, a mere delay in Juno's progress through high school, as if she had failed calculus and had to take it again next semester. In real life, it would have been an earthshaking event in everyone's lives. The young woman and her boyfriend would have been at their wit's end. And their parents would have been frantic, angry, and depressed, not ""bemused.""<br/><br/>Other misc. comments: The teen-talk and references have a short shelf life. This is by no means a film. that people will be watching in the future.<br/><br/>The sleazy portrayal of the abortion clinic reminds me that we do, indeed, have censorship in this country, even if it is implicit, not overt. You can bet that, if Reitman's high school girlfriend had become pregnant, she would have had an abortion. <br/><br/>By the way, I LOVED ""Thank You for Smoking."""
"compi24","Null","6","11","1 August 2011"," Review of ""Juno""
","Jason Reitman's ""Juno"" is a dramedy about a teenager (Page) who faces an unplanned pregnancy and decides to put her unborn child up for adoption. Now, I've heard a lot of good buzz about ""Juno"" since it's 2007 release, and I've been rather excited to finally see it. First off, I can say that the film itself is pretty good. I enjoyed most of the aspects of it. The acting on all fronts is great. Ellen Page is hilarious as the titular character, and Michael Cera is equally as funny as her awkward friend. The facet of the movie that I admired the most was the film's brilliant, Academy Award-Winning script written by Benet Academy Alum, Diablo Cody. I found every line in this movie to be delightfully unique, and Cody's use of modern dialogue devices really helps to give this movie a certain authenticity. Although this movie is labelled a comedy, I found it to be more of a heartfelt drama love story - especially towards the end. Overall, I felt that ""Juno"" was a very sweet addition to the comedy genre."

","I know that JUNO was a big hit with the pedophiles and sweaty-mouthed goons trying to catch a glimpse of sugartit, but I just have to get this off my flat green chest: Sorry Ellen, but this movie doesn't exist in a vacuum. Which non-hypocritical planet did you film it on? <br/><br/>Early 2010, Ellen Page starred in a series of commercials for Cisco, where she was purveyed as a role model for young girls. In 2007, Ellen Page played the title character in JUNO, a 16-year-old knocked up by her boyfriend, who finds a childless couple to adopt the impending child, tries to seduce the father-to-be, then goes crawling back to her wimpy 16-year-old boyfriend when all else fails. Nice role modeling, Ellen.<br/><br/>Just one question: How many GUYS are buying this crap? Oh, we know that 16-year-old girls across America are swooning in wide-thighed empowerment. But how many men over 20 hear Juno's lament, ""I need to know that it's possible that two people can stay happy together forever,"" and clasp their breasts in romantic abandon? Answer: None more virgins.<br/><br/>The splash-reviews squeal, ""outrageously offbeat comedy hit"" - the only outrage is the hypocrisy of the American public that would scream statutory rape when 16-year-olds are impregnated in real life and then embrace this movie as ""outrageously offbeat."" ""Delivers huge laughs and feel-good fun"" - after dealing with the reality of ostracism at school, sociological intolerance, stretch-marks and ugly baby belly that never quits, psychological implications of abandoning a child for adoption, morning sickness, mood swings, tender nipples, birth screams - when exactly does the ""feel good"" kick in? <br/><br/>Ellen Page plays Juno with the verve and vivacity that the part requires, and her performance sells the movie; problem is, she's playing it like a woman twice the age of her character. She knows too much. It's not that she's ""mature for her age"" - her cultural references are from another generation, all delivered with an irritating cynicism and insouciance that makes her sound like Jim Henson's Tarantino Babies. How many instances of Iggy & The Stooges, Soupy Sales and Dario Argento can she possibly pull out of thin air and remain credible? Writer Diablo Cody giving away her own age? <br/><br/>Jason Reitman (THANK YOU FOR SMOKING) directs, John Malkovich (yeah, the crazy one) co-produces.<br/><br/>J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney are Juno's credible, likable parents, and Michael Cera is the guilty willowy boyfriend, Bleeker (if anyone can imagine his sperm possessing the swimming power to actually impregnate someone), with all the screen presence of an apology.<br/><br/>Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner are Mark and Vanessa Loring, the cutesy adopting couple whom we discover have problems living up to their glossy-magazine aspirations. Bateman, though reined in, gets a few good Bateman-isms in there, and Garner, as always, looks and acts like her high cheekbones haven't healed yet.<br/><br/>I've got nothing against teen pregnancy. If an organism CAN procreate, there is nothing morally, ethically or psychologically wrong with reproducing. JUNO's makers think they're doing something new, forgetting that the earliest hominids (and many tribal societies today) mated and reproduced when they were slightly younger than Juno MacGuff - without all the egregious societal hypocrisy.<br/><br/>After pretending to be ""outrageously offbeat"" JUNO safely falls back on that demonstrably stupid message that someone ""meant for you"" might have been under your nose all along. This sixteen-year-old with warring hormones and no idea on how to be a woman tells Bleeker, ""I love you"" - and we're meant to buy that as sincere. When just yesterday...<br/><br/>... under some cloud of hormonal maladjustment she had tearfully jumped in her car, smooshed on lipstick deliberately, and drove out to actively seduce Mark Loring, then couldn't understand why she was doing it. And when Mark told her he was leaving his wife, did any inference seep into her small mind that he was inviting her to be a casual squeeze without strings or guilt? All proving that Juno doesn't know the first thing about relationships, love or sex. So we're supposed to believe her supposed epiphany when she declares her puppy love for Apology? Message To Girlies: That wasn't an epiphany - that's weighing her options and deciding on an Apology. After his smitten blue-balled confession that he thinks she's ""beautiful all the time,"" she figures this dorknozzle has his uses as a provider. Wait until they're both 24, after she's squeezed out a couple more kids (who aren't his), and he's between gas-pumping jobs and they can't make payments on the trailer....<br/><br/>Movie is made well enough, in that prosaic manner of all American teen comedies, but it is not ""original"" or ""delightful."" Juno spells it out just in case anyone missed the sledgehammer message of why this movie was ""different"": ""You're meant to procreate AFTER you fall in love, but with us we procreated first."" <br/><br/>That's nice, slut."

","Engaging tale of a pregnant teenager and a married couple looking to adopt a child from her. This movie has a very ""indie cinema"" vibe to it. I really liked the quirky, sort of folk music this movie utilises, though I could understand some people finding this a turn off.<br/><br/>Juno is very much a 'star vehicle' for the charming Ellen Page. Page pretty much gets all the good lines to herself. This movie will stand or fall depending on whether you are open to the character of Juno.<br/><br/>To my mind, Juno shares DNA (metaphorically speaking) with characters such as Darlene from ""Roseanne"", which was a classic U.S. sit-com. Juno isn't as bleak as Darlene though. Another reference point for this film would be the delightful if short-lived U.S. comedy/drama series ""Freaks and geeks"". In fact, I was tempted to describe the character of ""Juno"" as a ""freak"" but thought better of it...until she uses the term to describe herself. For those of you not familiar with the caste system in the US, people fall into castes such as ""jock"" (a sport oriented person), ""nerd"" (an academically orientated person), ""dork"" (socially awkward) and, amongst others, ""freak"", meaning a person who doesn't really fit the 'desirable' caste category of ""jock"" or ""cheerleader"" (guys want to be jocks and girls want to be cheerleaders in the U.S. apparently).<br/><br/>As an Australian, I tend to view ""freak"" as meaning ""normal""-people like Juno are infinitely more interesting to know and seem like people you would like to hang out with, as opposed to the more desirous castes, who seem really obnoxious.<br/><br/>A pleasure of this film is the interaction between Juno and prospective adoptive father Mark, played by Jason Bateman. Their conversations on the merits of movies/music is a highlight. Be warned, you do see a scene from a graphic horror movie for a few seconds.<br/><br/>Juno is impossibly witty and sensible-as if rewritten by a mature adult. I'd give this film 7/10 but suspect it will have repeat viewing value, hence the 8/10. In fact, as my reviews for this that years Oscar contenders shows, this movie would have been a worthy 'dark-horse' to take out the ""Best Movie"" Oscar. Not to be though.<br/><br/>Anyway, must say how cool Juno looked in that scene where she is sitting on a couch, with a smoking pipe in her mouth, Sherlock Holmes style. Impossibly cool!"

"brunostachel","6","11","24","28 December 2007"," Good, but No Credibility
","I was somewhat disappointed by ""Juno"". Going into it, I expected a deep study of the emotional/psychological storm women, especially 16 year old girls, go through when becoming unexpectedly pregnant. Instead, I got an ABC After School Special, ramped up a bit with some edginess. Jason Reitman's direction is good. The problem is the screenplay by first time screen writer Diablo Cody.<br/><br/>Obviously Cody has seen both ""Ghost World"" (2000) and ""Waitress"" (2007) because Juno's character is Enid from the former and her situation is Jenna's from the latter. She is the 17 year old Enid pregnant with Jenna's 25 year old maturity level. What is missing is the emotional investment in Juno's character, largely because of a lack of credibility that Cody did not bring over from those two films.<br/><br/>While watching ""Juno"", at times I felt Aaron Sorkin wrote the dialogue. Very slick, everyone knew exactly the right thing to say at the right time. Juno herself knows more cultural reference metaphors and similes than Dennis Miller. She is quick of mind and tongue, almost too quick to sound like a credible 16 year old. No teen awkwardness, no rough edges, except those necessary to progress the story. Juno sounds like a 50 year old Madison Avenue advertising executive and just as world weary. <br/><br/>Cody does try to make Juno and her friends sound like 16 year olds by having them say ""dude"" and ""totally"" over and over ad naseum. Now admittedly at 44 years old I am an ""old man"" and maybe out of touch with the speech patterns of todays high school youth, but I know my 16 year old never uses the words ""dude"" and ""totally"", implying there is a lack of environmental influence at school. My 23 year old and 21 year old, at that age back in 2000 and 2002, also never used those slang words. And I maybe heard one of their friends say ""dude"" one time.<br/><br/>Cody also neglected to explore certain plot elements that would have added more credibility to the film. Where is Bleeker's father? Why does her mother dislike Juno? Why does she not know about the pregnancy even though Juno's parents and the whole school knows who the father is? Where is the scene between Bleeker and his mother discussing the situation? If that was a creative choice to edit out by Reitman and Cody, why dosen't Bleeker at least mention to Juno how his mother feels about the whole thing? <br/><br/>The strength of the screenplay comes with the bittersweet emotional longing Juno carries like a heavy backpack for a mother we never see who abandoned her as a six year old. It is clear from the start all her actions regarding the baby she is carrying are influenced by this event. It was this character examination that made ""Juno"" somewhat involving in spite of it's flaws and interesting to see through to the end. But still, ""Juno"" is not a film I could sit through a second time, dude. Totally."

It was even nominated for best picture but luckily, and rightfully, did not win the award.<br/><br/>First of all it is apparent that this movie has no staying power. Watch it and 2 months later you'll forget almost all its details, and maybe vaguely remember it involves some pregnancy and some adoption plans. Truth is, there's nothing in the plot to intrigue us on the long term. There are no surprising twists towards the end of story, no groundbreaking developments, no intense verbal scenes and at best a few clever lines. If this movie is developed as a 5 episode drama I'm sure it will be much better, for the story simply does not merit a hour and half screen time. In other words, the plot is so empty that another director would be able to cut this into a 10 minutes short film.<br/><br/>This film basically exemplifies the fallacy of universal taste. Just because a few critics praised it at the very beginning crowds soon follow this judgment and claim that it is a great film with a realistic story plot, but truth is everybody's blinded from trusting their own taste. If we were to move away from the seemingly objective initial view that this movie rocks, we'll soon see that it is in fact opposite from good. The plot is totally unrealistic - a girl with that sort of intelligence goes through pregnancy and all the related troubles is simply not believable, or at all ""realistic"". The difference between being realistic and being plain boring is non-distinct, and perhaps this film, at least for my part, belongs to the latter.<br/><br/>A 1 out of 10 for me"

Hey, as I said up top, I like ""quirky"" characters and fun dialog but the dialog is just annoying. Call me whatever, but I just couldn't relate to Juno and her jerky friends. ""Quirky"" can be good, but it wasn't here. <br/><br/>Having said all of the above, however, this isn't a bad movie for young girls and Juno does some good things after a bad start, and kudos to her for that.

"robinsn-3","10","9","19","28 April 2008"," Excellent Movie  Acting is superb, you really feel for the characters
","After watching this movie for the first time last night, this has become one of my new favorite movies. I am usually fairly critical of movies, but this gets a solid 10/10 from me. Other users have called this just another College Student Quote Fodder movie, such as Nepolian Dynamite or Superbad. In my opinion, Juno is far above both of those movies.<br/><br/>Yes, it does have some of that. One-liners like ""He's the cheese to my macaroni"" are very definitely scattered throughout this movie. But it has a lot of feeling to it, where movies such as the aforementioned do not. Perhaps the most touching scene is at the end where Michael Cera is holding Ellen Page in his arms while she's in the bed in the maternity ward.<br/><br/>Page is absolutely perfect for this part. She portrays the intelligent, mature, and witty teenage girl role amazingly well. The character itself is so deep and has so many dimensions, it's hard to not become enthralled with her.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I thought Cera's character needed to be more developed. He was a very weak character, without much to him. The issue of his parents not liking Juno was a good start, but there could have been more.<br/><br/>Many comments I've read have said that Garner's role (the yuppie mom to-be) was their favorite. Personally, I found her character to be awkward and sort of hard to watch. I understand how she was rather dumbfounded at what to do or say regarding Juno, but it was a part that I don't think she was particularly well suited for. Her husband, however, played his part very well.<br/><br/>This movie really focused on Juno. That was good, and it made for a great look into Page's character, but, honestly, the other characters could have been replaced with just about anyone else for how underdeveloped they were. Cera did a good job as the quiet boyfriend, but a look into his thoughts or the dynamic between him and his parents would have been great.<br/><br/>At first I found the slang they used a little off-kilter, but it eventually fit in. The only times I thought it didn't really fit were in the opening sex scene when Cera says ""wizard"" and when Page describes Cera as being a ""boss boyfriend."" Other than that, though, the dialect between characters was fine.<br/><br/>As a side note, my favorite line from the whole movie was, by far, when Juno calls the abortion clinic and says ""Hi, I'm calling to procure a hasty abortion."" Such a witty comment, and for someone so young. It really made me chuckle."
"mistarkus","6","16","39","28 December 2007"," Sarcasm to the max
","Lighthearted, with not much of a story or drama, what the movie really is about and what the audience will derive the most entertainment from, is, as the title of the movie reads, - Juno.<br/><br/>A unique character is created. Juno actually is a good role model for young girls even though she unexpectedly got pregnant. She is independent, strong-willed, mature, smart, unaffected or moved by High school's socializms, truly her own person (a character correctly calls her. ""different""). Mostly amusing is her somewhat nasty sarcasm. Juno's constant snide sarcastic remarks permeate the whole movie especially towards the beginning and despite the burden she must deal with. This makes Juno appear totally devoid of innocence in sex, pregnancy and just about everything. Her ""been-there-done-that"" vibe seems far fetched for a 16 year old and more like a women 20 to 30 years older who has lived through life's agonies and ecstasies.<br/><br/>Not a hilarious, laugh out loud movie, unless you are really into sarcasm, which Im sure a lot of people are.<br/><br/>What starts out with a lot of sarcasm merges into a somewhat heartwarming story, as things don't go exactly as planned (and a good thing they don't otherwise this movie would have gone nowhere).<br/><br/>Also the dialogue was intelligent and witty. Perhaps too intelligent and witty for its own good which made it seem extremely contrived. On the spot one-liners from Juno actually felt as though they were planned and edited months in advance. Dialogue and wriitng are believable when they have more of a naturalistic flow.<br/><br/>Overall a bit blah but cute."

","Everyone likes Juno, don't they? I don't think I've heard a bad word said about it  and I'm not about to spoil that run. Was it Oscar-worthy? No, I'd say not  it's touch was a bit too light and the performances a little too studied in the attempts to be indie/cool, but it is a touching and sweet little comedy with great performances all round (I particularly liked Ellen Page and Jason Bateman) which managed to come across as not being judgemental despite the situations it covers (pregnancy, abortion, adoption, divorce, etc), rather simply portraying some interesting and vaguely kooky people with nice teeth in a tricky situation. Nice, exactly like the reviews said."

","This movie...Wow...where do I begin? I know there have been worse, but this is probably the most dumbest movie ever nominated for any academy award. I mean seriously, the acting?

I don't know if it's trying to be realistic or clever but it's just flat out LAME. I mean lame in every aspect of the word. God, the acting is just so silly, so naive. Same style as Superbad with those stupid idioms and witless lines especially Michael Cera, how is he even an actor? And the thing about the music, both the film score and the conversations about bands, and everyone pretending they know how to play guitar. LAME! The story wasn't bad, but just the way they executed it, didn't work. Why? Or maybe, how? How did this movie even catch the eyes of many to get raving reviews or a high rating even an ACADEMY AWARD?!?!?!? Are you serious, did they have no choice or something? What did the critics see? Flat out pathetic. What did I even do? I just wasted and hour or so of my life. How did I even bare to watch this movie? Trust me, if you knew better, you will ask yourself the same things.

"hugo_goedel","2","33","93","3 August 2008"," What about contraception? Flawed or dishonest script from the start.
","The worst thing about this movie is what it was awarded an Oscar for: the script. It may contain some funny dialogs (like step-mother Bren's remark about doctors) but its story is flawed from the start and for me logical flaws always spoil everything. (Since I liked the soundtrack and can enjoy it independently of the rest of the film, I gave it one star above minimum for that.) The story is about Juno, a self-confident, witty, sarcastic teenager who consciously decides to have sex with a class-mate whom she knows to be in love with her. After she suspects to have become pregnant (what a surprise), she even is self-confident enough to buy three pregnancy tests in a local store among a lot of loud fuss-making with the store-keeper.<br/><br/>And here's the problem: If she's that witty and self-confident, and if the sex with her class-mate was a conscious decision, why oh why on earth didn't she think about contraception for one moment? What would have prevented her from either getting a subscription for the pill or buying a condom and using it on the boy who was shown have taken a passive part in the act anyway? (He was sitting in an armchair at least at the beginning.) And the lack of logic doesn't even stop here: When she tells her mature, sexually active friend and then her open-minded parents about her pregnancy, nobody even asks her about whether she and the boy did or did not use contraceptives. (After all contraceptives can sometimes fail.) It's not as if something in the sex-ed went wrong or as if contraceptives have failed or as if Juno made a regrettable misled decision about unprotected sex, it's as if contraception didn't even exist in the world that Juno lives in. However that must be some parallel universe, because there is contraception in our world.<br/><br/>So in the parallel universe of the film sex invariably leads to pregnancy and if this is unwanted, it of course only leaves the choice between abortion or giving birth to the child and setting it up for adoption.<br/><br/>The next flaw in the script is when Juno decides to have an abortion in a clinic and in front of that meets an anti-abortion activist from her school. That school mate tells her that the fetus already has fingernails and from all human traits a fetus develops, it is just those fingernails that makes Juno revise her decision.<br/><br/>Given that this information given to Juno is just wrong at that point of time (after all she is said to be around week 12 and fetuses only develop fingernails from week 18 onwards), Juno's decision is now based on wrong premises. But that never gets cleared up in the film.<br/><br/>Instead Juno now finds a yuppie couple as adoptive parents who despite appearing to be quite nice (yet also a bit shallow and superficial) soon turn out to have some problems with themselves. However they have money and this alone seems to qualify them for being good parents.<br/><br/>Yet another flaw is when the lawyer of that couple leaves Juno the choice between closed and open adoption and Juno goes for closed adoption. This is in total disregard of the fact that Juno and the prospective adoptive parents already know each other and the places they live, so that that adoption can never be closed. (Juno will always know at least a little of the whereabouts of the child she gives birth to.)<br/><br/>I don't know whether the script writer (and those who bought the script and made a movie out of it) simply didn't think about these logical inconsistencies or if perhaps they willfully ignored them to push a conservative message (""Abstinence is the only way to avoid pregnancy, and if it's already too late adoption is an easier way out than abortion"") with a purportedly progressive film."

","I gave this film as many stars as I gave it because it had a likable cast and was at least a fairly fun movie to sit through.<br/><br/>There are a few things wrong with this plot. I find it hard to believe that a seemingly bright teenager skipped the crucial step of using birth control. I'd have found this movie much more believable and intriguing if they used birth control and she still ended up getting knocked up. I thought the film could have had deeper message regarding teenage sex and pregnancy, but the entire film was fluff like cotton candy at the fair. Throughout the film I thought Juno was just another average teenager, but with a very obnoxious way with words.<br/><br/>Yes, the dialogue. The heinous screenplay. The worst part of the movie, even over the iffy plot. I don't know how miserable Diablo Cody has been over the past ten years, but this isn't the work of a woman who remembers how teenagers really talk. Juno talks just like her stepmother. Everybody in the story talks the same or at least similar. And Diablo Cody is on myspace flaunting her undeserved statuette. The losing nominees are angry.<br/><br/>That's not to say that the ""wittiness"" didn't get to me in a positive manner. I laughed at some parts. I laughed at Paulie Bleeker's race car bed, but not at Juno's stupid hamburger phone, an instance where she absolutely HAD to address it on the other line.<br/><br/>This is hardly one of the greatest films in 2007.

","When any film starts creating buzz and garnering awards, I have to check it out to see what the deal is . . . . I found Juno to be OK, but not as great as its buzz claims  though it could have been with a few conscientious alterations. <br/><br/>There is a great deal to like, certainly  Ellen Page's performance, the treatment of teenage pregnancy in general, and the interplay of the characters. Unfortunately, the picture was marred by several things that either didn't ring true, or make sense within the confines of the narrative. The reaction of Juno's parents to the announcement of her pregnancy was blasé to the extreme! The stepmother's reaction I can almost understand  but the father? Didn't buy it  to him it was as big a deal as someone putting saccharine instead of sugar in his morning coffee!<br/><br/>The character of Juno herself was a bundle of contradiction. On one hand she seems to be wise beyond her years, and in other ways she's helpless. That might seem to make sense in the wake of her pregnancy, thus making the story more poignant, but somehow it just doesn't quite work. Juno's bonding with Mark was a pleasantly unexpected turn, but it went nowhere, and then Mark just disappears from the movie in the third act! When Juno tells her father that she knows someone that makes her feel accepted, I thought she was talking about Mark! I was surprised when she went to Paulie, especially based on his recent behavior in the third act of the movie. As such, her choice didn't ring true enough. If he was the one Juno chose, some voice-over narration throughout the flick indicating her caring for him would have made it make a bit more sense . . . <br/><br/>The music was, in a word, awful. The choice to use it was perhaps to give the movie more of an indie feel, but that still doesn't make it good. Maybe having Ellen Page sing all the songs would have worked, dovetailing into the duet she has with Michael Cera at the end  that would have made sense both actually and metaphorically. <br/><br/>All in all, Juno was a pleasant exercise, full of a potential that could have been realized had the film makers taken the time to step back from the work and see that the forest didn't look quite right for the trees."

Because traditional names are all gay. <br/><br/>4)If you are looking for adoptive parents, make it clear that they shouldn't be ""wholesome"". They should like punk music and gory old movies, and play kick-butt electric guitar. <br/><br/>5)The first time you do it, it should be in the most awful looking old chair you can find. <br/><br/>6) Body parts should be referred to as funbags, pork swords, vag, junk, etcetera...because that apparently is cool, as is being pregnant at 16. (I found out after I had seen the movie that the script writer is a stripper and phone sex worker. It figures.) <br/><br/>7) Teenage girls (who are smarter than their parents) should be able to be sarcastic, talk back and cuss at whomever they want, and throw up in the urn in the hallway. No one (including their parents) will raise an eyebrow or make you wash out the urn, cause they have attitudes and filthy mouths too. <br/><br/>8)Your parents won't be upset when they find out you are pregnant, in fact, they will joke about it. They won't yell or cry, they will be completely supportive of whatever you decide, and there will be no restrictions or consequences.<br/><br/>9) Once a teenage girl is pregnant nothing worse can happen to her. So instead of keeping a closer watch and worrying more about her and the baby she is carrying, she will be able to go wherever and do whatever.<br/><br/>10) All males (old and young) should be held in contempt and be made to look weak and uninteresting, and it is nonessential for a baby to have a father around when it is raised. <br/><br/>11) It is entirely possible to be pregnant and remain totally unattached to the child, and it will be a cinch to give the baby away, without wanting any compensation or future interaction whatsoever, get back together with the baby's father, and go back to your former life with no lasting consequences. <br/><br/>** I took my 16yo daughter to see Juno. We were both thoroughly disappointed with the movie. I had heard good things about it, and heard the soundtrack was supposed to be really great, so I was excited to see it. The friends we went with actually walked out after the first 15 minutes, and went to see another movie instead. <br/><br/>I have 3 teenage daughters aged 16, 17, and 19 and have been around their friends so I know a little about how teenagers are. I've gone through 5 pregnancies(I also have 2 sons). I know people that (girls) have been pregnant as teens or (guys) fathered a child as a teen, both in the past and recently, and the difficulties, consequences, forced ""growing up"" and emotional havoc it causes. I found much of the movie unrealistic, contrived, irreverent and sarcastic. <br/><br/>Oh, and the soundtrack that's being SO raved about...is lame. The best song in the batch is ""Anyone Else But You"" by the indie band ""Moldy Peaches"" (who thought THAT band name up anyway?)... it's probably their once in a lifetime hit wonder, and even that one in my opinion isn't worth paying 99 cents on iTunes for. <br/><br/>Redeeming qualities: The girl who plays Juno is a good little actress. Her dad and the step-mom were also semi-believable. There are quotable cult lines, i.e. ""This ain't no etch-a-sketch. This is one doodle that can't be undid, home-skillet"". I liked the opening bit where line art was tied in to the film. That's why I give it a 4. <br/><br/>I'm not recommending this movie to anyone. Don't waste your money."

","A little over a month ago, I was watching one of the movie channels on TV and Juno's premier was being shown and I recognized a few actors, obviously Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, and Ellen Page who made an incredible performance in 2005's Hard Candy. They started talking about Juno and what it was about and I just had to see this movie. It seemed like a great movie that was real and funny, just like last year's big hit Little Miss Sunshine. Finally after they finally released Juno in my town, I saw it a couple days ago and Juno truly did live up to my expectations, it's a very good film. Being Diablo Cody's first script, this was a great story, despite how common it is in real life, it shows the anxiety of being a pregnant teenager. Diablo shows this girl who isn't sure of herself now having to protect a human life growing inside her.<br/><br/>Juno is a 16 year old girl in high school, kind of a rebel who's in a band, she's just found out that she's pregnant. Paulie, her best guy friend, is the father, he wants to be with her and take care of her and the baby, but she just plays him off and says she'll just abort the baby. But when she goes to the clinic, she realizes something, maybe she could do something better, by giving the baby to a loving couple who will take care of it. She meets Venessa and Mark Loring, very rich, very put together, and offers them the baby pretty much immediately. But when she learns that Mark still has to grow up and Venessa is just dying to be a mom no matter what, she has a big decision to make while still trying to figure out what is love and who she is.<br/><br/>Juno is a great movie to start off 2008, it's cute, funny, heart warming, and real. Ellen Page was so terrific, I just know she's going to make it, I've been rooting for her, and I think Juno is the right kick off for her. Her performance as Juno was fantastic, she was so believable and you couldn't help but feel for her and feel bad for her on what she was going through in her high school. Ellen Page and Michael Cera are two young actors are shinning in today's films. Jennifer Garner, in my opinion, gives her best performance to date, she was so pretty and a wonderful character that had so much love to give. I highly recommend Juno, it's a well put together film that has a terrific story and was just a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Was it me or was this movie a lengthy commercial for the Right-To-Life movement? As Juno enters the abortion clinic she encounters one inarticulate protester(Yes, folks!Even one person can make a difference!). An offhand comment regarding a fetus having fingernails,along with a callous clinic worker(after all no one working in one of those places could be a good person), causes Juno to change her mind and flee the clinic. She decides on adoption with no more emotion than someone finding a home for a stray kitten. Nowhere in the movie is the difficulty of surrendering a baby for adoption addressed.Juno,lying on her hospital bed with her boyfriend post-birth, states that the baby never really felt like theirs.Maybe not ""theirs"", but any one who has given birth feels on some level that the child is hers. Unfortunately any sense of regret or real emotion is glossed over. In the end after the baby has found a more suitable home with the neurotic and newly single Jennifer Garner, Juno's world is one of sunshine and happiness. Her stepmother has gotten the new puppy she's been wanting(evidently Juno's selfless decision has cured her of dog allergies)And Juno's boyfriend is waiting to sing a charming folk duet with her.This is the same boyfriend incidentally who took no interest in her pregnancy or its outcome-truly a dream man for any girl!

","OK, granted I am far from being a teenager, and definitely this movie is not for me but to receive such high grade at this site??? I guess I'm an old school - I believe that any movie suppose to be a show, and trigger up certain emotions. At the grade of 8.4 it really should appeal to everyone, well it didn't. If it's suppose to be life like,than the whole idea of a ""nerd"" boy getting a hot girl when she realizes her ""wicked"" confused ways does not belong in it. The plain truth is that successful people attract another successful people, and at teenage years it's much harsher then later on in life when you compromise, so I really didn't really buy that part. In my personal opinion that excellent casting is the thing that saves this movie. Ellen Page is excellent in it, though i do feel that she's overacting a bit with her part. I feel that she is much too confident for a teenager. I did feel that chemistry between Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner was good - there was unfulfilled tension and everything - that was the high point in ""life likeness"" of the movie. The story is old and a modern interpretation of it doesn't really saves it. Really didn't get what is so special in it. In any case, I think that this movie is good for people with teenage kids, and maybe for teenagers but as for all the rest it's quite boring."

The scenes with Jennifer Garner are hard to watch because the silly lead character tries to belittle her.<br/><br/>The two weak subplots are sub par. I found the whole ""husband wanting to get with Juno"" ridiculous and creepy. I love the way she blows him off after wanting him the whole movie through. I felt no sympathy for Juno at any point.

She's unbelievably obnoxious.<br/><br/>This movie is so far removed from reality it should be classified as science fiction. Everything from the parent reaction to the constant pithy dialogue - it seems like an imitation of twee teen shows imitating life. Nevertheless, a lack of reality is acceptable if it's what you're going for. I'm not sure what Juno was trying to achieve. It's not funny, insightful or interesting.<br/><br/>Kudos to Garner.

","What is it with all these indie movies as of late? Hollywood finally considered the trilogy idea sucked big time, so now, as the 90s were the tear-jerker films years, they try to bring to us real ""slices of life"" through this emotional, plastic, incredibly witty story about pregnancy. <br/><br/>And that's what Juno is. An optimistic take at what seems to be quite a predicament, but hey, if you manage to squirm out that damn baby and kiss the father for having left you deal with it alone, you have achieved the quota of all indie films.<br/><br/>What bothers me here is that girls watching this movie might get the wrong idea, that pregnancy is perfectly fine and can be solved easily by just browsing for some control-freaks to purchase your unborn child and by letting out your jeans a bit so your huge belly would fit and you'd still look cute. <br/><br/>Juno had it so easy indeed! She felt no remorse, no shame, no anger, nothing. She only cried a bit in that saggy way when she realized her child wouldn't have a good home, after all. But frankly, who would give their kid to those people in the first place? And who could give their child so freely? Sure, if she had been some bimbo on the road that's fine. But she had friends and family, she seemed pretty smart.<br/><br/>Anyway, another disturbing thing is that she got back with that boyfriend of hers like nothing had ever happened. What is this? Safe sex for kids under 18? Sounds as if this movie was filmed some days before prom night and she had to lose the kid and look dashing until then.<br/><br/>Another thing was the soundtrack. OK, we get it, you're all rebellious artsy freaks with sarcastic gags that sound like Friends reruns. But why do you have to scream it in our face? Every little song in this movie begged for some attention and made the watch a bit tedious. <br/><br/>What I did like about this one was that they did away with annoying bratty high school stereotypes and I do not mean the real life stereotypes. I mean the Hollywood ones where the cheerleader is evil and sexy, the nerds all lust for naked chicks and the ONLY possible sport in the world is football. <br/><br/>Other than that, no matter how much I liked Juno's mum and dad, they seemed a tad unrealistic. I mean she told them she was pregnant two seconds ago and the mum is already giving her good nutrition tips. <br/><br/>All in all, it could have been better if it hadn't tried so hard to appear as something it was not."
"luke-346","8","6","12","17 February 2008"," A pleasant, mild-mannered, well-written, emotionally amusing... little film.
","Juno is the first film to be written by Diablo Cody and has already gained much recognition for its caustic and apt renditions of youth. The film tells of a 16 year old girl called Juno who discovers that she is pregnant. She quickly explores the various options available to her before deciding on having the baby put up for adoption. The film then follows her through the pregnancy and documents her along the way. Juno is a film that manages to tug at the heart strings of those that watch it and many critics have drawn obvious parallels with fellow off-beat heart warmers ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and ""Garden State""  films that are equally as good as, if not better than, Juno. What makes Juno better is that because of its chosen topic and amusing anecdotes it has a superior emotional appeal making the film more of a charm.<br/><br/>Juno is written with a sense of cynicism and wit that that feels both refreshing and pertinent to modern youth; her manner of speaking is aptly fitting for a 16 year old girl because it has been culturally influenced and reworked in her favour. Her quips, witticisms and sarcasm manifest themselves through her distorted grasp of language i.e. she utilizes words and phrases for her own benefit, as do many teenagers. Cody's ability to capture this style of speech has been appraised in many quarters with some interviewers even suggesting that she'd hung-out with teenagers before writing the film. She has denied this. My problem doesn't lie with the 16 year old Juno, but with all of the other characters  as I believe none of them stand apart from Juno. For example the banter between her parents bears similarity to Juno's distinct delivery, many of the lines delivered by her baby's father Paulie and her friend could have easily been said by Juno. To have these characters delivering quips and puns with such a readiness as Juno I found a little disheartening as it almost undermined Juno's incisive repertoire. Moreover Cody has since stated that many of the young Juno's attributes are ones that she'd have liked when she was 16. This information allows for more forgiving criticism as previously I had issues with a girl of 16 having such an extensive and knowledgeable background of punk music and Italian horror films. Unfortunately it doesn't bode well with your writing skills if you need to explain your motivations once the piece is finished.<br/><br/>Because the central theme to the film Juno is pregnancy it has been stated that it is championing pro-life (or dare I say it - American Christian Fundamentalism). I do not agree with this, but I do find it a little confusing that we never really know what goes through Juno's mind in the Abortion clinic. One such explanation is that perhaps it is an allegory for choice and, no matter her choice, no one (not even the audience) has right to know her reasons. With abortion being such a feisty issue I find it amusing that both camps have been stereotyped here. The receptionist of the abortion clinic is depicted as a sexually obsessed moron and the prospective patients are ridden with angst, but this is counter balanced by the lone pro-life protester outside that doesn't know what day it is or how to run her own life, let alone preach to others about theirs. Juno flees from both and there is no need to concentrate on the abortion clinic any further as Juno has made her decision albeit unknown as to why. Admittedly the premise of Juno could be frustrating to real-life pro-choice supporters, but to delve into these political connotations any further would be unjust to the film.<br/><br/>The music used in Juno feels like the makers are trying to impose their tastes upon us, much in the same way Zach Braff did with the band ""The Shins"" in ""Garden State"". A bonus in using such a technique is that it will increase the films cult status through strengthening its appeal and by possibly making it nostalgic in years to come, this idea is furthered by the final guitar scene. Directed by Jason Reitman, Juno employs certain approaches to this type of cinema that are steadily becoming clichéd e.g. the animated in-film titles or the various montages of stills but despite this the film moves along with a fluidity of pace that is both complementary and non-encroaching on the films themes. Overall Juno is a pleasant, mild-mannered, well-written, emotionally deep and amusing little film  it is film that will fill almost every audience member with amplitude feelings of placid merriment. All I can advise is to ignore the hype and go and see it in a small cinema with not many people or at home with a bottle of wine and you will not be disappointed."
"Forever_21","8","6","12","15 February 2008"," An intelligent and touching comedy
","When Juno (Ellen Page) discovers she is pregnant at 16 she embarks on a life-affirming journey in which she discovers much about the reality of relationships and, of course, parenthood. After discovering perspective adoptive parents willing to raise her baby as their own, Juno tries to maintain a semblance of normalcy during the nine months of her pregnancy in the hope that once the baby is born life can continue as if nothing had happened.<br/><br/>This film is all about Ellen Page and her wonderful portrayal of the slightly twisted social misfit, Juno. Her performance is sublime and despite her older looks she plays the sixteen year old brilliantly. She delivers the intelligent script naturally and with razor sharp wit. Without her this film would have had half the impact it did.<br/><br/>This doesn't take anything away from Diablo Cody who has written a superb social commentary which is genuinely funny. This is an intelligent comedy and definitely for the more mature audiences out there, it never resorts to low-brow humour and is never crass, there are no cheep laughs, no gratuitous nudity and no high school clichés. The humour is observational and many laughs stem from the dialogue, more importantly the humour feels natural, never does it feel forced or contrived. This is genius writing.<br/><br/>All of the support performances are equally superb. Michael Cera (Paulie) is excellent as the awkward teenage father who is not only dealing with the pregnancy but is suffering all the more because of his unrequited love for Juno. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are perfect as the adoptive parents struggling with a marriage on the brink of falling apart and Leah, the vastly more popular friend of Juno's, is played effortlessly by Olivia Thirlby.<br/><br/>There is very little to dislike about this film, you can't help but get swept away by Juno herself and the vast array of colourful and rich characters that encircle her. It's nice to have an intelligent and thought-provoking teenage comedy once in a while, especially in the sea of American Pie and American Pie wannabes. Highly recommended."

But just as ""Garden State"" has divided the viewers, it seems like some people have a problem with quirky humor coupled with serious themes.

A limited release almost a month ago? Then a bombardment of trailers giving away about 40% of the movie's best jokes.

She plays the whip smart-except-for-being-a-pregnant-teen Juno. Page handles what could have been a slightly irritating character in the hands of a lesser actress. I enjoyed her commentary about high school and would have liked more. She is incredibly quirky, as is the rest of the cast. To the point where some characters sounded semi-alike at times. We must have stumbled into Napolean Dynamite land a few times. Aside from Jennifer Garner, who largely plays straight-man, there isn't a non-quirky character in the cast. This is all well and good, but occasionally it felt a little surreal. Michael Cera plays the same character he did in Arrested Development and Superbad, but like with Christopher Walken, it's such a great awkwardly funny character that nit-picking seems stupid.<br/><br/>The movie succeeds at both the comedic (and lord are some bits funny) and dramatic bits, but possibly my favorite scene-stealing bit would have to go to Alison Janney as Juno's step-mom for the great ultrasound scene. I also loved JK Simmons as her dad. The shop owner at the beginning of the movie has possibly the greatest bit-part ever.<br/><br/>The movie is short and very sweet.

I wouldn't want her cracking any cheesy jokes at me. I didn't find her believable.

","So on Friday, against my preference, wifey got out ""Juno"" from Blockbuster. I was so not keen on seeing it for several reasons, yet was surprised- it annoyed me even more than I expected.<br/><br/>Juno (played by Ellen Page) is perhaps one of the most annoying leads from a teen movie in recent memory. She's a cocky, alternative teenager who decides one day she wants to express her feelings physically with her longtime friend Bleeker (played well by Michael Cera). As luck would have she gets pregnant and is faced with a big decision. She decides at first to go the abortion route but when she gets annoyed in the waiting room she decides to just give it up for adoption. She quickly finds a suitable couple called Mark and Vanessa (played well by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) in a local paper and her mind is at ease. She's a little cautious at first but eventually becomes very comfortable with them as Mark turns out to be really cool and Jennifer seems really genuine and excited. Just when things seem too perfect Mark and Vanessa split and Juno has another big decision to make. Luckily though everything turns out cool and Juno can shoot the bay out and get back to her real life and emerging cool band.<br/><br/>Objectionable and troubling on so many levels.

","We learn early on in Jason Reitman's comedy Juno that ""pregnancy can lead to an infant"". This is exciting news. Of course, most teenagers already know this and use condoms but if Juno (Ellen Page), a feisty sixteen-year old, and her boyfriend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), a straight A, high-school track star, realized this, there would be no movie. In that case, we would be spared a Diablo Cody screenplay that inundates us with hipper-than-thou dialogue, overly obvious pop culture references, and cutesy one-liners like a drugstore clerk (Rainn Wilson) telling Juno that ""Your eggo is preggo"" and ""This is one doodle that can't be undid, home skillet"". One or two of these one-liners are tolerable but a whole string of them leads us to question whether or not the author has a working relationship with how real people talk.<br/><br/>If the excessive quirkiness doesn't overwhelm you, Juno may ultimately be redeemed by the outstanding performances of Page and Cera, excellent support from Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner, and some genuine emotion and sweetness that leaves us remembering only the good things. While the film has much humanity, Mike Huckabee would have no problem with its anti-abortion subtext. After Juno and Paulie do it in a chair, abortion is considered but it is quickly dismissed as the filmmakers skew the odds against it by showing us a depressing waiting room at the abortion clinic, a disinterested receptionist who jokes about her boyfriend's junk smelling like pie, and a lone protester looking like a brave warrior instead of an obvious kook.<br/><br/>Carrying the baby to term seems like the only ""wise"" decision and Reitman/Cody display it as something of an inconvenience at worst and a pleasurable experience at best. There is no morning sickness or vomiting, no embarrassment at school, no pain and little trauma. Expecting the worst, Juno tells her parents (Allison Janney and JK Simmons) that she is pregnant but surprisingly dad and mom transcend the movie's flirtation with clichés and provide a thoughtful, supportive response. Dad comments that he didn't think Paulie Bleeker ""had it in him"" and mom, who works in a nail salon, thinks of the immediate  vitamins, and prenatal care.<br/><br/>The film works its way to a level of burgeoning responsibility and maturity but to get there, it moves through an unlikely adoption scenario in which a willing couple. Mark and Vanessa, is found through a newspaper advertisement. The couple seems more than eager to adopt but somehow we don't know what to make of them or where their real motivations lie. Our suspicions grow and become cringe-worthy when Mark takes a more than passing interest in Juno after they start comparing notes on rock stars and horror films. Ultimately, however, Juno overcomes our fears and our aversion to its smart-alecky cleverness and the film becomes a statement of generosity and unconditional love. Perhaps a bit too quirky for its own good, Juno is still a lovable film that works and works until it reaches our hearts."

","Ellen Page (in a star-making performance) plays an accidentally pregnant smart-alleck 16 year-old named Juno (named after the Roman goddess, not the town in Alaska) in the latest hyper-smart comedy from Jason Reitman (director of ""Thank You for Smoking""). ""Juno"" follows the latest Hollywood trend of quirky comedies that actually deal with some heavy issues. Unlike most of those films, ""Juno"" manages to stay funny even as it gets serious and treats its characters and audience with respect by keeping the jokes coming even as it gets cutesy or plays for tears.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Diablo Cody (a pen-name destined for greatness) has a knack for writing hipster dialog that doesn't wear thin or get annoying. She manufactures big laughs from both quasi-goofy pop culture references and nervous situations inherent to adolescence. She keeps things fresh even when the film starts showing its sweet side. Think of her as Judd Apatow without as much of the raunchy humor. Director Reitman gives the film the appropriate indie-feel and populates the movie with a great soundtrack of songs whose lyrics perfectly match Cody's storyline and dialog.<br/><br/>Ellen Page is eternally likable in the lead role, and the decision Juno makes in the end feels totally organic and true to her character, giving the film a ring of truth instead of feeling manufactured to make the audience feel good. Michael Cera proves again to be one of the most amiable and subtly funny young actors working today. His performance is a perfect companion piece to his more overtly hilarious work in the riotous ""Superbad"". The rest of the supporting cast is equally likable, and even Jennifer Garner, and actress who always seems to try so hard, seems perfectly cast here as an adoptive mother-to-be who tries way too hard.<br/><br/>Though not as laugh-out-loud funny as most of Apatow's films, ""Juno"" swings as one of the best of the quirky indie-comedies of the past five years. It's funny and has a heart, but it doesn't beat you over the head with it like ""Little Miss Sunshine"" did, and instead, thanks to Ellen Page and Diablo Cody, feels like the real deal."

"streetpunk","8","5","10","11 February 2008"," A movie with a beating heart
","I think this is my favorite film of the year. Other films were better as an all together package but none have the heart that Juno has. Ellen page is Juno, a teenager that chooses to have sex but accidentally gets pregnant. Ellen owns the character perfectly, you wouldn't think that shes acting. Its like someone was filming her in normal everyday life. There's parts were she is so into her character that she surfs through her performance like when she reveals to her parents that she is pregnant, when she confronts bleaker about the prom, and when she breaks down. The screenplay i thought was very unique, i think in the wrong hands it could of been annoying and stupid but Ellen page nailed it.<br/><br/>Jason reitman is a talented young directer, he previously made ""thank you for smoking"". In this movie he uses tone very efficiently, creating a world that is very immersive and original. The pace of the movie is great too. Michael cera does a great job in playing Juno's boyfriend, there's a scene were Juno confronts him and he is so into the moment that he almost tears up. One of my favorite things about the movie was the soundtrack, the beginning with Barry Louis ""all i want is you"" and the ending with moldy peaches ""anyone else but you"" is just great.<br/><br/>OK the movie is not without its flaws. I think the story of the couple doesn't finish the way it should, the Jason bateman character just leaves and there is no closure to his character which i think wouldn't of mattered if he was a minor character but he plays a big role in the movie. I also thought that the relationship between bleaker and Juno was not shown as much as it should of. The best scenes, performance wise, were when the bleaker and Juno characters interacted, for example when Juno tells bleaker that she is pregnant. Its a shame that they dint show more of their relationship.<br/><br/>All in all this is a great movie with strong performances all around especially by Ellen page. This movie was made with passion and love by the director, actors, and screenwriter that makes you feel so good after you come out of the theater, its contagious. There are some minor flaws in the story but all in all its my favorite film of 2007 because of pure passion and love that went into this film.<br/><br/>8.6/10"
"BushLiedMarinesDied","2","9","22","7 February 2009"," Lackluster, Self Absorbed, Geeky, Clunky
","I'd heard so much about Juno that I curious why I was so disappointed. It took re watching it & a long time thinking to come up with the answer.<br/><br/>For a start its got some of the same feel as Napoleon Dynamite, yet somehow it misses the mark. What struck me early on was the way colours were used, specifically red & gold, it is everywhere. While such visual sub texts can be subtle yet stunning in setting up an atmosphere (best exemplified by the 'eyes' in Blade Runner) in Juno it is too obvious & definitely overdone.<br/><br/>There's other ""Director's class 101"" stuff, note how the very pregnant Juno stands opposite Bleeker who has his hands in his sweat jersey pockets making his stomach area bulge too. it's supposed to show empathy, but its simply too obvious.<br/><br/>As for the plot, I don't get where its going nor do I care for the characters much. Juno McGuff, the lead character, seems to just drift through it all as if its not really happening to her, much the way that Bleeker does. This is a 14 year old pregnancy, where's the angst? Even the stereotypical ""rock"" of Brenda 'Bren' MacGuff, Juno's step mother, seems to be some sort of attenuated personality. Her biggest dream is for when Juno moves out s she can buy 2 dogs. This is truly geeky in the extreme. In fact almost everyone seems to be adrift in some way or another & if this is the message of the film then it is portrayed very badly & could have been done a lot better.<br/><br/>The Lorings at first come across as almost normal by contrast, but soon degenerate into yet more clichéd by-the-numbers Tortured Middle Class stereotypes. However I do have to say that Jennifer Garner as Vanessa Loring & Jason Bateman as Mark Loring distinguish themselves in their roles quite well, even give the creaky script. Garner is especially creepy as the obsessive adoptive mother to be & you can see why Mark Loring eventually has second thoughts & leaves.<br/><br/>This does touch a genuine theme, that when it comes to children quite often men's wishes & aspirations can be left behind or remain repressed by pressure of expectation, only appearing later when the situation becomes untenable & too much of life has passed by to remain in what for many men is a trap. I wish this had been explored more but we are left with the gaping dysfunction unresolved.<br/><br/>And this brings me to another point, the stereotyping of men in a lot of Hollywood productions, note Juno's pretty much dumb father, the rock steady step mother, the obsessed adoptive mother, the irresponsible I-Want-My-Freedom adoptive father who steps out of a marriage. Its feminised & hence sexist.<br/><br/>This isn't as bad as say Married with Children but this is sickeningly main stream these days. Look at that mobile phone TV advert where the father (who provides for his family) hands out phones to everyone & is seen as desperate for attention yet he is absolutely ignored by everyone. If this were a joke about stereotypical mother in laws or dumb blondes there would be outrage. But men are supposed to take it & say nothing.<br/><br/>Personally I think it is inexcusable & proof that the director, writers & producers of this film were lazy in the extreme & that's what sums it up. Its lazy, lazily shot, lazily written & lazily acted (mostly). The great sound track does rescue it, but I could generate the same interest from my iPod without sitting through Juno."

Fairly unbelievable. It became overwhelming towards the end, especially with the Thunder Cats reference.<br/><br/>I think I'm also biased since the theater was full with a bunch of people who laughed at the obvious slap stick humor and drowned out the next few lines.

","Juno (2007) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Delightful comedy about a 16-year-old girl named Juno (Ellen Page) who finds out she's pregnant and decides to give the baby to a happy couple (Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman). This is a touching little film that certainly has its heart in the right place and I don't think there was a single second where there wasn't a smile on my face. The film has a terrific screenplay that allows for plenty of laughs as well as some nice and tender moments. Page gives an excellent performance as the teenage who gets into a situation over her head. We follow her character for nine months and we see her go through all sorts of changes and Page perfectly captures all of them. She's got a great comic timing but she also handles the dramatic scenes very well. Garner also turns in a very good performance but the real shock is Jason Bateman who turns in a wonderful performance. It's good to see him doing something different and I guess this performance proves that an actor can do much more if they are offered something different. J.K. Simmons also deserves a mention as Juno's father. I think some of the over the top humor keeps this from being a great film but it's certainly an original film considering how many pregnant movies are out there."

Granted Teenage pregnancy is skyrocketing in America, (proven by the TV show '16 and pregnant') it doesn't show what really happens.

The step mother was her usual funny character. She has been in many movies and always delivers her role with such accuracy and perfect comic timing. The dad also was a good character role and his role added some typical dad/daughter characteristics. The emotions portrayed were real. I laughed so many times.

"jaredmobarak","9","7","16","11 September 2007"," TIFF07, review: It all started with a chairJuno
","It's a good feeling when you can walk out of your very first Toronto Film Festival showing thinking, ""Wow, that was great."" The screening was for Juno, the sophomore effort from director Jason Reitman. Let's just say that the proverbial slump is nowhere to be seen. I enjoyed Thank You For Smoking immensely, however, the ending couldn't hold the tone he had set up from the start. With Juno, I kept waiting for the same pitfall, but thankfully it never showed face. As Reitman said in the post-show Q&A, when reading debut writer Diablo Cody's work, he too was anticipating the train to derail and couldn't believe it stayed solid through to the end. For a script that took her only two months to write, after a producer happening across her blog emailed her his compliments, she hit this one out of the park.<br/><br/>The story is about a girl who just finds out she is pregnant by her best friend Paul Bleeker, played by the wonderful Ellen Page and Michael Cera respectively. Trying to come to grips with the situation, and dealing with issues ""way beyond her maturity level,"" Page decides to give the child up to a family that will love him or her. On the journey that follows, some quirky relationships manifest between Juno and her baby's father, her own father and stepmother, and the family she is giving the baby to. Throughout it all is a strong display of comedy gold. As the screenwriter Cody said, while she was never pregnant, the relationships are surely autobiographical. She experienced life as a sixteen-year-old, and by adding the dynamic of childrearing, was able to hypothesize the antics that could ensue.<br/><br/>While the subject matter is serious stuff, Reitman allows the screenplay to circumvent the weight with a big dose of levity. If nothing else, you will leave the film remembering some top-notch one-liners as Cody has a knack for sarcasm and witty retorts. The abundance of laughs helps get us through the heavier moments and never shortchanges or patronizes the situation at hand. All the credit here goes to Page for a powerhouse performance. She is coming into her own as a woman to look for in Hollywood. Her attitude is infectious while being slightly rude as far as social standards go. The character is fully believable as one who understands what is happening yet tries to play it off by disguising it with humor.<br/><br/>That humor succeeds even more by support from the rest of the stellar cast. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney have spot-on timing with their cynical yet loving affections for their daughter Juno. Everything Simmons says is classic and when Janney gets room to roam free; she delivers some of the biggest laughs. Michael Cera is hysterical as always with his innocent looks of naïveté and natural screen persona. Reitman did admit that he ad-libbed a few lines, and to enhance a script like this one at his age by going with the flow shows the talent he possesses. I just hope he breaks out of the mold a little bit more and soon, as he has played the same role in the last three enterprises I have seen him in. And, what better way to begin the film than with a spot-on cameo from an uncredited Rainn Wilson that brings the laughter strong straight away.<br/><br/>As far as the heart to the story, it really is the relationship between Juno and the couple she is letting adopt her child played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner. Their interactions are the core of the film. Each experience sets a new learning curve for the young girl and it is the evolution between the three that creates the film's payoff. Garner may be a tad overbearing in her presentation, however, if she toned it down, it might not have been as effective.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the kind of small film that proves how good art can bring great people together. The rapport between Reitman, Page, and Cody post-viewing was very light and cheery as though they were longtime friends. It appears everyone involved had a blast and believed in the message they set out to show. Never moralizing or shoving an agenda down our throats, this comedy is here to entertain. The laughs are big to the point where you may miss the next line, but that's OK as its one I'd revisit anytime.<br/><br/>Tidbits from the filmmakers:  On being willing to receive input from Cody during production, Reitman says, ""I've never been a sixteen-year-old girlalthough I tried.""  On the producers being American, Reitman says, ""Oh, no, this is Canadian, it was shot here."" Ellen Page replies, ""We'll just use their money.""  Props to Diablo Cody for not letting early fame get to her head and sporting a Superman t- shirt to the screening."
"wastebot","3","16","46","16 January 2008"," Commercializing Teen Pregnancy
","Either the story or the director completely fails this film. I'm guessing the script because there's only so much variation the director and actors to do. They'd have to basically rewrite it. Worse, it seems like a teen copy of a 20-something film done earlier this year, which was an even worse film (and I won't mention it's name for that reason).<br/><br/>Is Fox now manufacurting films for each age group based on a single script?<br/><br/>There are things I like about it, like the soundtrack and the acting. The lead actor, Ellen Page, pulls it along. She is much better in Hard Candy, largely because the script and dialogue are not done by somebody randomly picking slang from the past 20 years in a failed attempt to make the teens sound like real teens.<br/><br/>Back to the story, it feels vague, disconnected, and pointless, lacking even the typical joy of some young, naked flesh. If sarcasm was intended, it need about 10 more minutes of film to setup. It's as if a commercial copy writer decided to write a film. Not so bad that I want my time back, but you'll be happier spending your time listening to Moldy Peaches, Antsy Pants, and Sonic Youth (the bands most featured in the soundtrack)."

The soundtrack is painfully bad. <br/><br/>Then the portrayal of the abortion clinic as a horrible place was such anti-choice propaganda I nearly stopped watching again. Her pregnancy is of course shown as trouble free and unrealistically easy.<br/><br/>The main problem is : Juno is incredibly irritating. She's meanspirited. I would never want to adopt a baby with her genes. (& from someone too stupid to use protection). The decisions she makes are so spur of the moment, that a little thing changes her mindeither way. Michael Cera is 1-dimensional, unintelligent & does nothing but eat tictacs. Jennifer Garner is also 1-dimensional obsessed only with having a baby. <br/><br/>The dialogue is completely unrealistic. No one talks like that. Especially, no female (and hopefully no male) would ever refer to breasts as ""fun bags"". The whole film tries WAY too hard to be 'hip'.<br/><br/>And the writer seems to think she needs to follow the Clerks/indie model of discussing films and songs to show how hip and indie she is. (p.s. the Melvins are the *ONLY* band I have ever heard BOOED on stage). <br/><br/>The forced last minute changes to make a 'happy' ending are incredibly weak and seem to come out of nowhere.<br/><br/>I might've snickered twice.

","This movie is completely overrated. The dialogue was like an episode of Dawson's Creek taken to the Nth degree. It was trying so hard to be 'quirky' that it felt completely contrived. Um, you guys need to figure out that REAL quirky people are NOT trying so hard to be quirky. Real 'creative' people just are. That's it. This is somehow failed to be grasped by the general populace. Somehow this 'seems' authentic to many, given the predominance of positive ratings. Granted, I am an artist, like many indie films, and actually am a fan of Belle and Sebastian (which weighed heavily in the soundtrack). You'd think I would have appreciated this effort. But, it honestly seemed like a half-hearted Napoleon Dynamite rip-off that was in need of heavy revisions. It just didn't ring true. The guy who was complaining about Page's flat chest just needs to get a life. Maybe he should compensate for his lack of 'junk' (as per Juno dialogue). I actually thought much of the acting was good. The script was the weakest part. I only laughed at about 10% of the jokes. I consider myself to have a healthy sense of humor. I feel that the person who wrote this was arrogant and was not self-critical enough. But considering the 'rave' reviews, why the flip would that person bother? People are stupid. This is further proof."

","After hearing many people recommend this movie saying it comedy genius I gave it a shot and was sadly disappointed. <br/><br/>The main plot of the movie is about Juno Macguff (Ellen Paige) a 16 year old girl becoming pregnant. Many people in the movie especially Juno herself often comment on how she is the cool outsider-she could have tons of friends and be popular if she wanted but no she's to cool for that. She came across as obnoxious and a bit of a brat always commentating on how things are so unfair to her. <br/><br/>Paul the father of her baby is maybe in the film for about 10 minute's and each time he is wearing a 1970's track team uniform that makes him seem out of place. He is usually saying something about how awkward and geeky he is. He and Juno have almost no chemistry even though they are supposed to be in love. <br/><br/>The rest of the characters are about as thin and flat as paper. Mark and Vanessa the adoptive parents are the typical married couple who have drifted apart. Vanessa is smart career orientated and caring while Mark is a jerk who is still stuck in his rock star past unwilling to try and be a father when he can be a thirty something rock star. <br/><br/>In the end Juno is a movie that took a few high school stereotype's and couple of colorful costumes and then decided to make a movie about it. All in all Juno is a movie that does not deserve repeat viewings."

","I love it! Not since Stranger Than Fiction have I thoroughly enjoyed a movie in this genre as much as Juno.<br/><br/>It's a deceptively simple plot line (teenager gets knocked up and puts it up for adoption), but never has teen pregnancy been portrayed in such a comedic yet sweet manner. Sure, the dialogue is too witty and clever to be mouthed off by practically the entire cast but that's part of the reason why Juno is such a nice surprise; it's self-effacing and doesn't take itself too seriously but bothers to leave a great message anyway.<br/><br/>Playing the titular character is Ellen Page, who is wonderful as an incredibly pretty tomboy who looks like she's straight out of a Judy Blume book. The rest of the cast are just as amazing: Michael Cera (Superbad, Arrested Development) plays Paulie Bleeker, the unassuming geek-next-door who knocks up Juno, Rainn Wilson (The Office) as the acerbic storekeeper Rollo, Jennifer Garner (Alias) as eager mum-to-be Vanessa Loring and Jason Bateman (Arrested Development) as her hubby stuck-in-the-90s Mark. Even the parent characters (Allison Janney as stepmom Bren and J.K. Simmons as Juno's dad Mac) who are normally stereotyped get their share of the good lines.<br/><br/>The direction of Jason Reitman (Thank You for Smoking) is wonderfully light and moody, matching the offbeat but lovable script by stripper-turned-screenwriter Diablo Cody. The soundtrack, set and costume design all helped fortify the overarching mood of this feel-good movie. I look forward to seeing more material from Reitman, Cody or Page!"
"Polaris_DiB","9","6","14","10 January 2008"," A probably unnecessary pre-emptive argument
","These days, Indie-wood movies involving quirky characters and certain sensibilities reflected by their prominent musical choices are a dime a dozen. So how can I convince you that this one is somehow different, that this one has warmth, humor, and intelligence, and that it stands out? Mostly, it's popularity is a decent argument: this movie has been pretty well received by both audiences and critics alike, giving it a devoted following. Unfortunately, there's also the tendency with situations like that for people to way raise their expectations and then hate it because everyone else likes it, and for once I'd rather that not happen. But as a single reviewer out there, I also kind of distrust myself to try to convince for the Universal appeal to it because, well, for once in my life I watched a movie where I got all of the music references! And I was one of the few (two, that is) people in the audience to laugh out loud at that Sonic Youth quip.<br/><br/>But here's what I have to say about this film to those wary of the over-saturated nature of movies about sarcastic teenagers. One: this movie features a pregnant teenager, but is not a pregnant teenager movie (the baby solves no pre-existing problems, creates no questions into the value of life, and doesn't really change the character beyond her usual teen discovering of self). Two: this movie features a lot of Indie music, but it is not, as some people have already attempted to call it, ""A Moldy Peaches music video."" Three: Think you see a cliché coming? Wait five minutes, it won't happen. And Four: it may be quotable, but thank the makers, it is NOT Napoleon Dynamite.<br/><br/>What this movie has that most of the movies it's compared to doesn't have is lack of brooding self-seriousness, spot-on writing, and the perspective of an absolutely lovable character who really has little problems at all--only a desire to be cool and work things out, which is much more beautiful than worry over hormones and meaning-of-life stuff. It has a few stumbling blocks--it's book-ended by a ridiculous device involving seats, the first scene in the convenience store is the only one that feels like it's trying too hard--but anyone who can relate to the voice of Juno the character and narrator can relate to anything about this movie, and it's pretty open. The dialog is, in fact, so brilliant because it isn't searching for quotability or lowest-common-denominator relatability, but it's also not bone-dry humor and totally obscure referencing (though I did already bring up the issue with the music). It's... *GASP*...GENUINE! Anyway, I'm glad that this movie is getting so much initial appreciation, I'm just worrying about the inevitable ""Mannnn, that movie was soooo overrated and I'm too cool for it"" lashback, because Juno the movie only wants two things: to be cool, and work things out. So hey man, be cool, and sit back and let things work themselves out.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","I had heard so much hype about this movie and the leading character's performance. When I saw it I wondered what all the fuss was about. The dialogue was unrealistic, as young people in small rural towns do Not talk like that and the 'quirky' characters were boringly pretentious, rather than endearing. The sarcasm was Not clever or funny and the characters were strictly two dimensional. Ms. Page is very cute and spunky, so that must be why her less than stellar performance was lauded. Too bad the controversial out-take, with the neighbor, whose furniture was moved to Bleeker's lawn didn't make it into the film. It would have woken a few people up, but I guess most film makers take the safe route rather than boldly put themselves out on a limb. Refraining from rocking the boat seems to be the latest trend in churning out family fare, nowadays... Ugh!"

","i didn't enjoy Juno b/c it contains a lot of things that don't even happen when teen pregnancy occurs and especially if its a problems in the us. first of all, Juno's parents were fine when she told them she was pregnant and allowed her to have the baby, she found the perfect adoptive parents which isn't common at all, as the pregnancy goes on all of her classmates hate her even her boyfriend tell her that they get married she would be a very mean wife, no one in school even her boyfriends wants to take her to prom, and Mark the adopted father of her child tries to get a divorce because he doesn't like Juno. so this is something a lot of people try to prevent and this movie is promoting teen pregnancy even more and a lot of things in the movie don't occur very often such as finding perfect adoptive parents for the baby and the parents allowing Juno to have the baby."

The plot was an amazing idea, simple as it was. And the acting was really well done and believable. But I have to say, what I liked most about this movie was none other than the main character, Juno MacGuff. The character's lines were spunky, and they were all said at exactly the right time. Also, the character Ellen Page portrayed was a teenage girl that I would like to be friends with, despite the mistake she made. She wasn't too laid back about the pregnancy, but she also wasn't too worried. All in all, this movie was awesome, and I like to watch it over and over again."

","The words hilarious, moving and realistic came to mind as I sat in the cinema watching a film which I strongly recommend. I entered the cinema completely unaware of what I was about to watch. To begin with the graphics were excellent and made the film more entertaining and understandable.Furthermore the sound track was unique and catchy, and for days after my first viewing I was still humming the tunes, not at all irritated that they were still rolling around in my head. But the acting alone could have turned the film around, because all the actors were on time and comical (Ellen Page especially). The film touched base on a sensitive subject which is discussed commonly , but it made it fun and enjoyable. And most of all it made you feel special in your own way, It made you feel positive and well, good. I seriously suggest it. 100 stars positive."
"gd286","10","5","11","15 February 2008"," Go Caroll!
","One of my favourite lines in the film delivered with great aplomb by Elle Page. I guess she is the main reason for how much i like this film. She delivers her lines with such conviction and charisma i cannot help but smile every time i remember whole scenes from the film. Her ability to look confident at one moment and then vulnerable the next is disarming making it impossible not to fall in love with her character. The movie creates it's own parallel universe where parents are understanding and supporting without the usual drama involved in situations like the one portrayed, where parents are relaxed and don't take their anxieties out on their children. The dialogue is quick and witty and refreshing as far as I am concerned with perfectly delivered jokes. Of course it's not realistic but who cares? it works very well within the frame of the film. Tarantino's dialogues are not realistic but everybody enjoys them because they are delivered by gangsters and larger than life characters which most people never meet so it's easier to suspend disbelief. The fact that the characters in Juno are just ""normal teens"" doesn't prevent me from enjoying their clever and innovative dialogue. Not all films have to resemble reality, and i think it would be very boring if they did anyway.<br/><br/>The entire cast puts on a great performance and i especially appreciated seeing Michael Cera and Jason Bateman doing what they do best, playing ""embarassing quiet"". The soundtrack as first seems completely removed from the story but slowly as you relax and allow yourself to immerse further into the story it makes a perfect fit. Definitely one of the best soundtracks i have heard in a long time.<br/><br/>There are moments of unexpected tenderness in the film which don't bring on tears but a deeper softer feeling of happiness at having witnessed them.<br/><br/>I'm going to go on limb and say that my response to this film has been the strongest to any films this year so i would make it the film of the year just for its fearlessness in being a little transparent sometimes."
"nightswatch","8","5","11","24 December 2007"," a smart, believable little film
","Having just seen this film Christmas eve, to what I thought was a surprisingly packed theatre, I feel quite satisfied. I had heard some mixed chatter heading in, although it was mostly positive, and the film did not disappoint. I thoroughly enjoyed the intro, but after the credits I felt that it did lag for about 15 minutes. A few of the initial exchanges between juno and her friend felt strange and forced, but overall it laid a solid groundwork for introducing us to Ellen Page's Juno. And it must be said that Ellen Page is excellent. I had only seen her briefly in the throwaway X3 previously, and she thoroughly impressed me here. Her performance is certainly what anchors the film. This isn't a typical ""teen"" movie, nothing over the top happens, it isn't absolutely riotous (though it is quite funny). It is, if nothing else, very real. And this all centers on Page's utter believability. She is witty and confident and quirky and unique, but also acts very much her age, and is vulnerable as well.<br/><br/>The other standout performance is the always excellent Jason Bateman. He certainly has a feel for comedy, but he plays it rather understated here to great effect. The subtlety of his reactions both around his wife, and then the effect Juno has on him, were impressive. I was certainly hoping to see him and Micheal Cera together in a scene once again, but was left disappointed.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this film. It is being compared to Garden State and Little Miss Sunshine by many people, and I would have to agree that all three films possess at least some of the same characteristics. Jason Reitman has gone 2 for 2, having followed up the effective Thank You For Smoking, with this excellent sophomore effort. It's definitely worth checking out, especially when confronted with the relatively terrible film selection at present.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I just had the chance to see the multiple Oscar nominee, Juno. In a word; underwhelming. This film can be summed up easily by the snarky slogan ""Just because nobody understands you, that doesn't make you an artist."" This was a Lifetime movie written by someone with a serious Fargo fetish. It had all the quirkiness and sporadic dialogue with none of the art or nuance of the Coen brothers. And I didn't even like Fargo. (For my own reasons; I can still recognize the skill with which it was made.) Add a little Napoleon Dynamite to the mix, and bam! obviously it must be great. After all, the movies it is derived directly from were. The dialogue is uninspired, the ""comedy"" is mostly nonexistent, (and I'm aware it was not 'Dude, Where's My Car;' I never expected it to be.) Additionally, it is an unrealistic and a bit dangerous portrayal of teen pregnancy; this is where the Lifetime filter comes into play. In short; the comedy is bland and substitutes quirkiness for writing, and the drama is bland and uneven. A vastly overrated film."

"cinephile-27690","10","1","1","9 April 2020"," Juno Is Perfection.
","I first saw Juno on the night before Valentine's Day, and I instantly fell in love with it. It became one of my top 10 favorite movies as soon as it ended.<br/><br/>This morning, my Grandma channel surfed the TV guide and it turned out that Sundance was airing Juno. I saw that and said: ""Oh, Juno! That's a great movie!"" So she turned it on and watched it, and I saw half of it with her(since I was getting ready for the day.) She loved it too. In fact, when I joined her, she told me that she was hooked.<br/><br/>Juno is about a teen girl, who after a one night stand with her best friend, gets pregnant. After rejecting an abortion, she finds and befriends an adoptive couple, and a relationship blooms.<br/><br/>I personally find Juno to be a flawless movie. If I had to nick pick anything, it would have to be the one pointless F bomb that's used in the labor scene. That would seriously be it.<br/><br/>Juno works on many levels. For starters, the character development is a pleasure to witness. Juno and her friend Paulie have great chemistry together and their transformation from friends to a couple is very realistic and heartfelt.<br/><br/>Vanessa and Mark also work well as the the to-be adoptive parents. There is even a change in their relationship at the end, making for a great twist in what otherwise might have been a cliche or simple pregnancy story.<br/><br/>Juno is also a very effective comedy. For instance, my favorite joke happens in a scene where Juno asks her father if true love can really last. He describes what a person who truly loves you does, which includes: ""The right person will still think the sun shines out your a$$."" It's funny, but so true!<br/><br/>Juno has many witty jokes and one-liner like this, and that's part of it's charm. Even when a joke isn't cracked, it's still a pure delight that never fails to make one smile.<br/><br/>The camera work success most with the color contrast. Jason Reitman, the director, blends clothes with backgrounds and sets in a way that it's pleasing to the eye, even if it's just everyday looking.<br/><br/>Juno is not just great entertainment, it can be a great educational tool. If you have a teenager, know a teenager, or you ARE a teenager, this is a movie you should get around to seeing. This wonderfully shows what pregnancy is like, and why, while it's beautiful, it should be saved for someone special and at the right time.<br/><br/>As I mentioned in the plot summary, Juno considers and rejects having an abortion. As someone who is pro-life, I really appreciated that aspect. Juno did have a choice, and she chose to benefit another couple before herself, which is really moving.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't really condemn abortion though, it just shows that it wasn't the right choice for Juno. That makes for a nice balance that wouldn't cause rallies in front of Fox's movie studio.<br/><br/>People like to say that there is really no such thing as a perfect movie. I offer Juno as my rebuttal. It's a masterpiece in a way you wouldn't expect. As a teaching tool or a piece of time-killing entertainment, Juno succeeds on all possible levels. It takes true talent to make a movie this special. I'm grateful that such talent exists."

","While 'Juno (2007)' sometimes tries a little too hard to be 'quirky', this is an enjoyable and unique comedy that's never conventional or predictable. There's been quite a bit of backlash against it since its initial release, but I think it handles its subject matter with maturity in general. This push-back against its presentation is, to me, undeserved as it's the outer-layer of the flick that allows it to stand-out but it's the inner-layer that contains all of its heart. It doesn't preach and, as such, is an entertaining experience. Its ultimately an experience essentially enhanced by its 'quirkiness', too, and is a general joy to watch. 7/10"

Has there been a better performance this year than Ellen Page's creation of Juno? I don't think so. If most actors agree that comedy is harder than drama, then harder still is comedy depending on a quick mind, utter self-confidence, and an ability to stop just short of going too far.

I would have thought that cell phones would have been ubiquitous among teenagers in 2007, even in Minnesota. I didn't really notice if there were any (other) cues (car models, etc.) that the setting may have been some time prior to that.

After all the, movie is something must-see and offers a different point of view on a state in which much usual movies tell nothing new. Also the representation of Juno's mother-in-law is something good in this kind of movie, a character who is not only honey and sugar towards our pregnant girl, but also shows a complex relationship with a young woman who isn't her daughter.

Jennifer Garner and Jason provide a quality role as a married couple. The best description of ''Juno'' would be a little ''strange''.

"Benjamin_Cox","9","1","1","28 July 2013"," A smart, sassy and brilliantly written comedy - 89%
","I've always said that if I can write a movie half as good as ""Pulp Fiction"" then I'd be happy. But as great as Tarantino's opus is, it still feels artificial. Vincent and Jules would never exist in real life and Mia's overdose would be all-too-fatal - in short, none of it feels like real life, however entertaining it may be. But this film, from debuting screenwriter (and first-class name-holder) Diablo Cody, manages to feel not just entertaining but almost autobiographical. With scalpel-sharp dialogue and blistering performances, this makes one of the best-written film I've seen become one of the very best.<br/><br/>Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is a sixteen-year-old high school student who discovers she's pregnant after one night's experimenting with her best friend Paulie (Michael Cera). After fleeing from an abortion clinic, Juno decides to go through with the pregnancy and give the baby up for adoption to a nice couple. Meeting up with musician Mark Loring (Jason Bateman) and his wife Vanessa (Jennifer Garner), Juno has no qualms at all about going ahead with the plan and relies on the help of her parents Bren (Allison Janney) and Mac (the always wonderful J.K. Simmons). But as the seasons pass and Juno's delivery date gets every nearer, will things ever be the same again for her, Paulie, her family or the Lorings? <br/><br/>It's easy to spot an actor or actress giving brilliant performances and while ""Juno"" is full of them, Page is simply superb as the quirky teenager, firing off one-liners like they're going out of fashion. Feeling like a living version of MTV's ""Daria"", Juno is smart, sassy and remarkably the most level-headed character on screen. Cera handles the role of the bewildered father-to-be with excellence too while Simmons and Janney have real fun with some of the lines - Bren's sparring with the ultrasound technician (Kaaren de Silva) is a rare scene that's performed to such a degree that not only did I wince at the verbal sparring but wanted to cheer for her afterwards! The film's soundtrack is also fantastic, scored by the artist Kimya Dawson who I'm not familiar with but will try to track down now. Her songs and lyrics have a beautiful simplicity to them that flow through the film like the changing seasons the characters find themselves in and turns what might have been a depressing story into one filled with a positive, life-affirming message.<br/><br/>So why does it miss out on a hallowed 90%+ score? I kinda felt that it lost its way a bit. I found it difficult to sympathise with Garner's overly enthusiastic mother-in-waiting and the ending didn't feel right either - at least, the adoption part. But by and large, this is a brilliantly written, directed and performed comedy about the various trials and tribulations about growing up faster than you'd wish for. It feels quite female-orientated and yet, I still would happily recommend ""Juno"" to anyone who enjoys an intelligent and all-too-plausible film that is the polar opposite of something like ""Knocked Up"". This has a sensitivity, a heart that governs not just what happens to the characters but has enough left to get its pro-life message across without being overly preachy. Page is a star with a real future ahead of her if this is anything to go by and I personally feel the Academy got it wrong by snubbing Page's Best Actress nod. It might be a bit 'indie' for some people but ""Juno"" is a film to be enjoyed, understood and celebrated for years to come."

I had a reasonable day at work and sat down ready to be enticed into the trauma of a young girl with a load on her shoulders, but in a way, this Oscar nominated picture kind of strayed from her emotions in the first hour, which I felt was a big mistake. A 16 year old who is carrying a baby that belongs to the love of her life who has suddenly gone cold on her, and she isn't bothered by this massive burden ahead of her? OK a rough past may have made her grow up, but still some emotion at the beginning would have given the character a more realistic and interesting image. Page's Oscar nominated performance was OK in my personal opinion, though I have never seen her in anything else before, but her character was really annoying.<br/><br/>I had read a few reviews to, all claiming that it was a funny film, but I must have smiled once throughout, as the actions and dialogue had my eyebrows firmly placed at the top of my head in confusion.<br/><br/>I felt the first hour was really poor, with a stereotype running the show, questionable dialogue, and sometimes bizarre direction. The acting is good, from everyone. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are good, but don't match up to J.K Simmons who is terrific, as is Michael Cera.<br/><br/>However, despite all the faults in the first hour, there is a great realistic last half an hour with tensions running high and changes in proceedings, finally giving the film an edge and an interest to keep me watching to the end. One scene actually made me feel sorry for Juno.<br/><br/>Despite its faults in direction, humour and characters, the film still conforms to the genre and has a really good last half an hour, but given the tension and excitement I had heard and read leading up to it, it was a real let down."

Emotional roller-coaster that Juno has to go thru, dealing with issues which would not normally be dealt with with her tender age.<br/><br/>Only quirks i though were little unusual, was Juno herself was incredibly rare.

There were a few chuckles, but no one in my theater (which was packed) rolled in the aisles. The only laughter was small, nervous, and slightly forced.<br/><br/>I've heard people rave about the soundtrack, which I personally found annoying. The music dragged me out the action of the movie instead of complimenting the movie.<br/><br/>The acting was fine, and I think that Ellen Page has a great future in movies. In fact, it's her acting along with the fine ensemble which makes the film decent. With a better soundtrack and less gimmicky, unfunny one-lines, this movie could have been more.<br/><br/>Sadly, my biggest complaint is that it glamorizes teen pregnancy, even making it seem cool. Even if this movie had been hilarious, I would still have that complaint. Teen pregnancy should never be cool or cutesy, even if you pack it into an edgy, oddball comedy."
"bob the moo","Null","6","15","17 February 2008"," Walks a fine line between being clever and smug but mostly is smart, funny and touching with more to it than just superficial quirkiness
","Juno is a sassy but geeky teen who is ""sexually active"" at age sixteen. When she gets pregnant with friend Bleeker, she decides to have an abortion but somehow the clinic just doesn't feel right and she goes for the adoption route instead. With ""perfect"" couple Mark and Vanessa Loring set up, the father kept secret and Juno's family supportive, it is only a matter of the seven or eight months between now and then to go.<br/><br/>Juno had me a bit worried and I wasn't really planning to see it. Indie-spirited and described as ""this year's etc etc"" I didn't feel sure that it was being praised because it was good or praised because it was just a bit different and quirky. It took me about twenty minutes to get an answer to that because, although very cool, the opening credits and soundtrack selection do scream ""quirky"" and ""kooky"" as if it was having a sale of those qualities. Indeed this does continue across the whole film as the dialogue is smart and rapid, the characters ""off-beat"" and the music slight and quirky. With this sort of material it is very easy to fall into the trap of just getting by on being cool and quirky and other similar films have done so. Fortunately Juno just about makes it work even though it walks a very fine line at times.<br/><br/>For this director Reitman owes writer Cody a drink because the script produces great characters and interesting scenarios across the ensemble approach. Ultimately it will feel too insubstantial and quirky for some viewers but for me I was impressed by the way it drew out the various characters and twisted things to be more downbeat and realistic rather than the upbeat, sassy stuff that makes up the majority of it. Not that there is anything wrong with this though, because it was the quirky touch that got me into the film. In this area Reitman pulls it all together really well and, aside from the cosmetic touches, brings out good performances from his cast. Page dominates the film and seems to find sassy Juno effortless; however she is also good in the harder, more emotional moments  my favourite being in the basement scene where she betrays her fragility. Cera is currently hot so makes the poster but really his role is small and mainly relies on him looking funny in shorts (which he does). His Arrested Development father Bateman is good and I liked how he held his character constant while allowing circumstances to totally change the perception of the audience. Garner does the same but in the opposite direction and her damaged, stressed character is convincing and real. Janney and Simmons are both strong in smaller roles on the ""quirky"" side of the material while the rest of the cast tend to be well observed minor characters (eg Su-Chin, Vijay, Bleeker's mum) that continue the quirky independent feel.<br/><br/>Overall then, Juno does walk a fine line and I totally understand why some viewers will find it unbearably smug and full of its own cleverness but for me it actually has enough going on within itself to avoid being just a load of quirky characters, songs and dialogue. Page is great in the title character and the ensemble cast all turn in good performances while the script gives everyone plenty to work with. Not the second coming that some proclaim it as but certainly not the superficial quick-fest that others say it is  the truth is somewhere in the middle and it is very enjoyable and effective while performing this balancing act."

","When I first heard of ""Juno"", I thought it would be a sweeter version of Alexander Payne's ""Citizen Ruth"" (1996, starring Laura Dern). After seeing Jason Reitman's (""Thank You For Smoking"") new indie gem, I realized that Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), the 16 year-old who gets pregnant on her first time, has much more heart than the outrageous Ruth Stoops - Juno could actually be Enid Coleslaw's (Thora Birch in ""Ghost World"") younger sister, a girl who's smart for her age and who looks incredibly confident but, naturally, realizes that being a mother at such a young age is something she's not ready for. Her dilemma through this unexpected and unwanted pregnancy gives Diablo Cody, a former stripper in her fine first script, the chance to create a quirky dramatic comedy with equal doses of sarcasm and warmth - which makes it even superior to Payne's merciless satire.<br/><br/>Ellen Page, after her amazing turn opposite Patrick Wilson in ""Hard Candy"", proves that she's not a one-hit wonder and that she has potential to become one of the finest names of this generation. But the entire cast is fabulous: Allison Janney (as Juno's stepmother), J.K. Simmons (as her father), Michael Cera (her part-time lover and full-time friend), Olivia Thirlby (her best friend who's into older guys - ""Me too, I love Woody Allen!""), Jason Bateman (as a possible adoptive father for Juno's baby) and, particularly, Jennifer Garner, who impresses me here as an actress for the first time. As Vanessa, the possible adoptive mother, she's human and moving, making you feel all of her character's sorrow for not being able to be a mother - unlike the sweet but immature Juno, who wants to get rid of her baby as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Plus, not only the cast, script and directing are top-notch, but ""Juno"" also has a terrific soundtrack: The Moldy Peaches' ""Anyone Else But You"", Velvet Underground's ""I'm Sticking With You"", Cat Power's wondrous cover for ""Sea of Love"", and songs by Kimya Dawson and Belle & Sebastian, among others, help to tell Juno's whimsical journey. ""Juno"" is easily one of the best films of the year, and to those who are comparing it to the TV show ""Gilmore Girls"", as both Juno and Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) have the sharpest tongues out there, I'd say there's a big difference between them: Juno is actually funny. 10/10."

"cityforever1974","3","5","12","22 February 2009"," You're not missing anything.....Spoiler
","This was a depressing movie. Juno was a sad movie of a plain, eccentric and unpopular teenager living in a middle-class suburb who becomes pregnant. Her friend whom she is impregnated by (it's unclear of the closeness of the interpersonal relationship when she initially inseminated) is a member of the school track team, but he's similarly lower on the adolescent stratification scale at their school. Juno is not a particularly academically achieving student and the prospects of higher learning appear dismal for her. She did demonstrate the propensity to excel at playing a guitar and had somewhat broad knowledge of rock music. But from all observations she had a myriad of flaws.<br/><br/>The movie did depict Juno as making some redeeming decisions, albeit not well thought out. Juno was part of a merged family. Her biological father was a heating-air-conditioning repair man. He was remarried and had an early school age child. His wife was a full-time carer and not working. Therefore it would be fair to assume that should Juno have and raise this baby that it undoubtedly would place a financial strain on this family system. Given this reality Juno showed some responsibility in seeking adoption. She found the perfect couple in the Penny Saver (this should have been some kind of red flag). Once meeting the family she's completely flippant about her pregnancy and cites she would push it out now, but it would probably look like a sea monkey. The upscale yuppies are prepared with an attorney who tried to feel out where Juno was. Juno is hardly concerned about what she is about to sign into. She states that she is not interested with any remuneration or cares to see the child after birth. This theoretically gave the attorney the opportunity to craft a contract whereby the couple could back out for almost any reason (her job is to give the best available options to her clients) and Juno needed to fulfill her part of the bargain as described by the adopting couple. In other words lets say if the unborn child was identified to have any birth defects or if the couple just decided to change their minds, Juno would be left holding the bag (excuse the pun). On the same token after the husband told Juno he was leaving his wife and shattering Juno's concept of her future baby having a pampered and privileged upper-middle lifestyle, Juno wouldn't have any legal ground to stop the adoption even if she wanted to. Juno went forward with a relationship with the husband of the couple. The two had an interest in rock and played the guitar. Although Juno was only seeing their interaction as strictly platonic, the husband appeared to have different ideas. That was demonstrated while they were slow dancing and he softly said he was going to leave his wife. You can take that for whatever it's worth, but to me he was saying I am leaving my wife, would you like to start a different kind of relationship. Juno displays her naivete by expressing sheer shock over what he just said. Again, Juno was not the sharpest knife in the draw.<br/><br/>Another strange aspect about the movie was the relationship between she and her boyfriend. It's unclear exactly how close they were when she became pregnant. Yet, it's demonstrated that the relationship was not characterized by a deep and abiding love. So it is safe to say they were good friends with mutual interests. I found it curious that her presentation of rolling someone's carpet and living room chair and furniture at his front doorstep, then while sitting there with a pipe in her mouth saying she was pregnant didn't garner any significant shock from him. I mean you're 16 and your female buddy tells you that as a result of the experimental, unprotected sex that the two of you had resulted in a pregnancy, it would stand to reason that this would come as devastating news. Yet, he responded as if she had told him that she wasn't taking Trigonometry her senior year. He should have been broken up by such a news bulletin given the fact that this would have demonstrably changed his life. This was a kid from a working to middle-class single parent family. Unlike Juno, he didn't posses an entrepreneurial aspect to his persona. His only extracurricular interest was running 8 miles a day. Babies cost money that he didn't have. At no point did he show any contrition for the decision the two made. As the pregnancy progressed they became closer emotionally. I guess that was some of the more redeeming qualities of the movie.<br/><br/>In closing, this was the saga of a flawed teen with few positive characteristics. The sad thing is that Juno is held up as a wonderful, enigmatic adolescent gaining useful insight on life. Yet, the reality is that she is no role model for any teen"
"heart_and_seoul","Null","5","12","9 January 2008"," the real message in the movie, at least to me.
","I'd like to respond to a comment a certain user posted: ""I saw Juno last night and thought it was dreadful. I think the movie sends the WRONG message when it comes to teenage pregnancy. Teenage pregnancy is a TRAGEDY for all those involved, least of which is the innocent child who, statistically, has very little chance of becoming a successful adult. I simply do not understand why so many posters believe this movie was 'witty' or a 'feel-good' movie. Is there any doubt that teenage girls will think that Juno was cool for getting pregnant? Having sex with her boyfriend on a chair? Awful, terrible, immoral. It's bad enough we've got the Hiltons, Lohans, et al to deal with. A sharp tongued, 'bad-ass' pregnant teen with an attitude who listens to Iggy Pop is just what we need. I was equally shocked to see how many 'tweens' were in attendance. Their parents should be ashamed.<br/><br/>Somebody had to say this."" I agree, teenage pregnancy is a very serious issue and although Juno was quite uncanny in most every situation, I must say that I completely disagree with the above comment.<br/><br/>I was nearly brought to tears during several parts of Juno and why you may ask? 19 years ago, my 14 year old biological mother gave birth to me, giving me the greatest gifts she could ever give me, a life to live and a wonderful family. I know there's many people out there who only see the negative side to this movie but what I saw was the mature decision Juno made for her baby, to give it up for adoption instead of aborting him. I know many people out there are pro-choice, but I guess I don't really see how a teen girl giving a baby a life and allowing a parent to have a child she's always wanted, can be such a bad thing.<br/><br/>So to the above poster, perhaps Juno is a feel good movie for those who do live their life as adoptees, thankful to be alive and to have not have been aborted.<br/><br/>And what was that line...""Teenage pregnancy is a TRAGEDY for all those involved, least of which is the innocent child who, statistically, has very little chance of becoming a successful adult."" Well here's a statistic for you. I am the result of a teenage pregnancy. I've graduated from high school, held a part-time job since I was 14 and worked for most everything I've had, I don't do drugs or have run-ins with the police, and am putting myself through college right now. I do believe I have a very good chance at being a successful adult and I bet there's millions of other results of teenage pregnancies who can say the same.<br/><br/>So whatever these moral bashing people are saying, I thought Juno was a kick ass movie. If you like that weird, immature humor from movies like Superbad, this movie is hilarious. If you loves those moments that just makes you go ""awww"" you'll love this movie. And yes, if you are pro-life in any little way, you will see these movie does have a good message to it."

Not a single actor falls short in their role, drawing the viewer into Juno's world from the first scene on, and leaving the viewer no choice but to root her on the whole way through. The standout actors in this movie are Ellen Page and Jennifer Garner. Never has Jennifer Garner (as far as i've seen) done this kind of a character, its very entertaining watching how paranoid and stressed she is. (Junoverse ID #1776)"

In Juno the acting is so stilted it comes off as if everyone is literally reading off of a script. I am a huge fan of sarcastic, dry, witty humor, but I found everyone's comments predictable and lacking in the humor or wit department. The same people who think Dane Cook is funny are the same people who think this film is funny.<br/><br/>So the film lacked in comedic ability, no biggie. At least the story should be good.

Four excellent movies and this rubbish. Thankfully it did not win, but one never knows at the Oscars (remember Citizen Kane)"
"doctorsmoothlove","10","4","9","27 May 2008"," The best comedy of 2007, and one of the best films of the decade.
","Rarely does modern cinema produce a film capable of moving an audience in the way Juno does. From the quirkiness of the screenplay to the anti-folk music, Juno, is a highly enjoyable film from beginning to end. The film takes a different approach to the high school sub genre and the pregnant girl sub genre. It neither focuses on the social interactions at the high school nor does it portray the anxiety typically associated with teenage mothers (in film and life). Instead, Juno's pregnancy brings her closer to her family and best friend Bleeker. It finds humor in the unconventional, be that when two characters compare their tastes in slasher films or when Juno's parents discuss their original hope that she might have been expelled from school. It's this approach that distinguishes the film from most others and why it has received such attention and praise. While I wish the secondary characters had been more developed, I won't take away any marks because Juno herself changes considerably during the course of the film.<br/><br/>Part of Juno's success is the reality and charm of its script. Juno speaks in a way one would expect a girl of her interest to speak. She is a cynical young lady with distinct preferences in indie music, and her intimate knowledge of such music groups reflects that. This is rather surprising, as most high school films sensationalize their female protagonists. Mean Girls portrays young women with incredibly unrealistic dialog (to the point of absurdity in the continued usage of ""like"") that it infringes on the audience's enjoyment of the film. The revelation of her pregnancy, and more importantly, Juno's parents' reaction to it, establish the film as unique. Juno is a film which humors us with its realism, as we would expect the film to have a negative tone given its topic. Similarly, the costuming perfectly supports the individual situation when characters interact. Vanessa wears a horrid and moldy shirt when she argues that the baby's room should be painted. Mark wears more formal clothing during this scene, which is symbolic of his distance from her.<br/><br/>Even though Juno didn't win the Best Picture, I still think Ellen Page should have received the award for Best Actress. Her performance is extraordinary. Her cynicism appears so naturally that you may forget you're watching a film. Her devotion to Bleeker, while not explored as much as I would have preferred, becomes more obvious when she is around him. Her body stiffens as she sees him trot in the back of the track team. She also looks uneasily tense when she dances with Mark and rebukes his declaration to divorce Vanessa. Her weeping after this news is also outstanding. Her visceral tears and parking at the side of the highway is remarkably lifelike. She looks as if her own parents are divorcing (again). While the acting is never sub-par; the other characters lack sufficient screen time to display their talents (with the exception of Jennifer Garner) Ellen Page's portrayal of Juno MacGuff is memorable and worth viewing.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have about the film is the excessive number of characters it has. Certain people, such as Su-Chin serve as comic relief and seem unnecessary. The only benefit of characters like Su-Chin and Bleeker's mother is to exacerbate Juno's cynical responses. However, this limits Juno's ability to really interact with Bleeker. Her decision that she loves him appears with little evidence of its genuineness. I personally wish Juno had spent more time with Bleeker instead of Mark, but this may have limited the comedic value of the film due to Bleeker's accountant personality.<br/><br/>What raises Juno above most other films is the ease with which someone can identify with its protagonist. Juno becomes more responsible about her own life, more aware of her romantic feelings, and more loving of her parents during her pregnancy. Nevertheless, despite all this, she is still a child. This is why she sees nothing unusual with visiting Mark, a married man, and why she still plays guitar with Bleeker at the film's end. Most of us can recall something in the past which happened to early and deprived us of our innocence. This happens to Juno too, but she still maintains her childlike inhibitions and romance with Bleeker.<br/><br/>Usually during reviews I do not respond to criticisms of the particular film I am reviewing, but I feel that a portion of the negative reviews on IMDb are not logical. The first is that the film does not realistically portray teenage pregnancy. Sure, but when have non-documentary films completely portrayed an event as it would actually occur? The appeal of cinema is to escape actual reality and anticipate the film's reality. The second major criticism is that the film propagates abortion as the first option to unwanted pregnancy. In the context of film criticism, this argument has no relevance to Juno. Juno is not a propaganda film, so it is free to portray abortion any way it wishes. Abortion is actually quite common for young women in her situation, which contributes to the realism of the film. The final criticism is that the plot progresses too slowly. I see this as a matter of taste. Yes, the plot isn't as quick as an action film, but drama films are rarely known for their fast pace or small story time. A slow pace is necessary for Juno's pregnancy to occur and her character to develop.<br/><br/>Juno will become one of the most famous films for both Ellen Page and Jason Reitman. Reitman is now out of his father's shadow and casting his own. His film provides a more satisfying humor and memorable story most of what his father directed. I strongly recommend the film to anyone, regardless of whether they enjoy comedies or not. Those who do not will enjoy some portion of the film, as its appeal is profound."

I already enjoyed her smart and bitchy turn in Hard Candy, but in Juno she's a treasure to look at. The way she talks, the way she looks, the way she moves, she IS Juno. Being both naive and aware at the same time makes her a breath of fresh air to look at...to gaze at. If Ellen doesn't get her statue then no one should get it, the Academy should show some cojones and go for Page, not Piaff or Julie Christy. Going on, Juno has a great little story. It was original and sweet. Just like the characters. Juno's dad (JK Simmons) is adorable, just like Michael Cera's Bleeker. Jason Bateman is also very likable as the adopting father, and Jennifer Garner pulls it off as the desperate mom-wannabe. It's all a joy to watch, with the right pace and the right variety between drama and comedy. Juno is supported by an excellent soundtrack, with every song matching the screen. <br/><br/>After 96 minutes, when the credits rolled past, I was crying my eyes out.

Then the problems really start...<br/><br/>Review:<br/><br/>Teenage pregnancy, tough note to some, more of a tough note to the parents of the supposed victimless teenager whose new found realisation is bestowed upon. Juno is a witty and very clever tale of a down to earth 16 year old who comes to age, so to speak of her really, really unplanned pregnancy, in a film which receives more coverage than the other two films put together. <br/><br/>The second film from director Jason Reitman, following from his smooth debut piece' Thank You For Smoking', and the first script from multi-careered Diablo Cody, of details we won't go into right now. Juno has the first trouble for being compared in the same demeanour and style as 2007's 'Superbad' which, in addition, stared Michael Cera prior to Juno. Some gloat that it tries to impress, but be like any other film loving viewer and go see it to judge. A three-act structure that follows the emotional highs and lows of Juno's winter-to-summer pregnancy, the film saves its aces for last. <br/><br/>A touchy subject is the main brunt from audiences to try to wonder why to approach a such a 'Serious' subject, all too common in the UK, which will cause some segregation.

Juno has her cheerleader best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) to discuss to for the big news, offering support for the ride to come, the pace and tone shifts to a more floating setting and full of more warming scenes.<br/><br/>One of the surprises of Juno's character is her unwavering wit, it just so happens to act as a blanket for her insecurities and a strategic defence for people's opinions; she is definitely given the main spotlight for a reason, her witty, cunning and self-sufficient manner. This is the key to when she breaks the news to the old Step-Mum and Dad, (you knew it was coming) played by J. K. Simmons and step-mom Allison Janney, who add a lot of depth on their part to the story, not grief stricken about their daughters lack of control and immaturity but her maturity to give the unborn baby to adoptive parents, everything is planned out well, what's to worry about? Juno's up the duff, big time, the more is shows the more problems it brings, but carefully written scenes and moments show Juno's softer side, and is first glimpsed in her relationship with the baby's father, Paulie (Michael Cera).<br/><br/>Here come the crazy adoptive parents! The wife, and soon to be mother, Vanessa (Jennifer Garner), uptight high-class control-freak, leaving our sympathies to side with, albeit relaxed, father Jason Bateman's Mark, a former grunge musician who matches Juno's personality so well, from music, to living style. <br/><br/>""I'm dealing with things way beyond my maturity level,"" she tells her dad, as an example of the type of conversations Juno has with her understand father after she finds herself drawn to Mark and his collection of, music, gore movies and manga comics. This does really show how young she is. Scenes like this that gives the film depth, as Juno gradually discovers who's on her side in life's battle. The almost wholly without dialogue, scenes shows the greatest achievement in emotional impact and restrain from making it too dramatic, it also bodes well with Juno's character when in the midst of all hell on earth, she keeps that whit, that fast-talking loudmouthed mind to a closed silence. <br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>Sharply written, funny in the right places, heart-warming and 'edge-of-your-seat' enjoyment. What you need for a great time. 8.5/10."
"abinandhan-1","10","4","9","7 February 2008"," A Genre Should be Named after this Movie - because it will fit in Romantic, Teen, Comedy & Drama & all of that
","Review: This is the most enjoyable movie so far in 08. Sweeney Todd is good too, but this is more of the feel good kind. The centric role of the movie, played by Ellen Page, as Juno, is a 16 year old teen high schooler and a hard ass at that. She is not the gorgeous cheer leader or the slutty bitch every guy wants... She is the girl next door or even less average compared to the girl next door if you will. Her mom is divorced and sends her a cactus every valentine's day... Her dad, who is actually very cool, is into hardware, she has a step mom who has a liking to dogs and a sister by way of her step mom.. This is more than you would want to know about everyone except Juno.... Juno is the cool, smart and laid back teen that you see everyday and gets pregnant the first time she tries IT with Bleeker (Michael Cera)...<br/><br/>The movie begins with Juno performing a multitude of pregnancy tests.. After confirmation, she tries to get the baby undone and later decides against it... She wonders about giving the baby to adoptive parents who are in real need... The scene where Juno breaks open the news of her pregnancy to her parents is a laugh riot... Her friend, played by Olivia, is the remarkably naive and equally aloof friend of Juno and does a nice job.. she is one the many characters who fit the bill and makes you wonder ""Casting is seriously a department in Movie Making"". Juno finds Jennifer Garner and her husband to be her child's adopters.... The emotions, funny ones mostly, that Juno goes through and her daily routine up until she delivers the baby is the movie in its essence.... Juno takes a liking to Garner's husband because both of them have a lot in common when it comes to topics ranging from the wood used in making the guitar to the Wizard of Gore... The movie, fortunately does not take the ugly turn, if you know what i mean.. A little later, Garner's husband gets cold feet when the delivery day nears and they actually files for divorce for reasons not shown in broad light...<br/><br/>Juno, unable to find faith in humanity after being a spectator to Garner's life, has a talk with her father.... Juno, as the teen who realizes the fact that life is not all about being cool and smart and witty mouthed, expresses her confusion so vividly... After the talk with her father, she finds real love is actually with Bleaker.... In the meanwhile, a few other incidents happen which i might have missed in this review... its simply because all the scenes were natural and felt important and obviously i cant remember them all.... Ellen Page's performance as Juno might well be the best female lead performance you might see this year.... She is so cute.. at least to me :) When she finally says ""Bleaker is the cheese to my Maccaroni"", you know you have seen a good movie... The only minus to this movie could be, some times at hind sight, i feel that Ellen might have tried a bit harder to be cool in the movie... but thats OK.... and also, May be the movie was so real, actually, overdose of reality may be, could be the other drawback if you need a reason to reduce the points of this movie....<br/><br/>See this movie at any cost, for, what ever your frame of mind is, its only bound to improve on the positive side.... Please watch it................................bye!"
"Quinoa1984","8","8","23","27 December 2007"," indie-movie preggers, yey!
","Juno is an adorable sort of movie because, for the most part following its first third (which is ""hip"" on parade), the genuine impulses of the characters come out without contrivance. As this and Knocked Up have shown us in 2007, a movie where its main character gets pregnant is, for the writer and/or director, like a Western in approaching the form: you know where it will lead (duh, waa, waa, it's a fill-in-the-blank), but the fun is filling in the blanks of the characters and sharp dialog and story points.<br/><br/>While, as will be quite arguable with some, Knocked Up might have a better hold on its tone from start to finish, writer Diablo Cody is a sharp cookie, with a sense of wit that knows no bounds, as if someone dug into the latest indie kid at a high school and learned all the little ins and outs of what is really cool in what should be usually the outcast (which, by the way, is what ends up being ""hip"" in that Ghost World kind of way). Her script starts off with scenes and dialog that, actually, don't ring entirely true as reality, but it is fun to hear the actors say such dialog that would give Daria a run for her money, some of it even laugh-out-loud funny ('oo, Woody Allen!"") <br/><br/>But as the film goes along, particularly in its last third, it really deepens in the sense of the weight of the situation at hand- there's a baby, hello parents! What starts off as genuinely (and please I mean this as a compliment) quirky stuff turns into sweet and tragic-comic. Reitman ends up striking it out of Cody's material with a similar freshness he brought to Thank You for Smoking (there's one little scene involving the 'type' of girl some guy likes that Juno points out, and it's just like his quick style from the former film). He's a good chip off the old block, as it were.<br/><br/>But lets get to acting, which most have raved about a lot in the press and online. Ellen Page is, indeed, the breakout actress of, well, the moment I guess. She just clicks with this character, as she did (maybe more frustratingly so) in Hard Candy, and through Juno's slings of comebacks and pop culture references she's never misses a beat- by the time we see her layers peeled away as a scared, frightened pregnant teen, she's perfectly vulnerable. Meanwhile, Bateman breaks out after a string of bad comedies, Michael Cera stretches his legs (so to speak) pretty well, and JK Simmons and Alison Janney steal any scene they're in, bar-none, with Simmons especially playing one of the most realistic dads in any teenage comedy I've ever seen.<br/><br/>It's huggable at times, and endless with its ""indie"" appeal- hence the cute songs from Kimya Dawson- and had Cody just tightened the reins on that first third, where she goes for broke in trying to impress anyone who's to read her script, she'd have a really great genre-bending hit. As it stands, however, it's really, really fun, and did I mention huggable? Preggers rock, woo! 8.5/10"
"t-pitt-1","4","3","6","15 February 2016"," Do they think we're idiots?
","It's very hard to review this film without giving away the conclusion, but I will try. I started feeling uneasy about half an hour into the film, and my unease grew and grew as it progressed. The film makers did a very clever job of making the film 'cute', appealing, sweet and sugary in order to distract the viewer from realising what a huge con job the whole thing was. Are we seriously expected to believe that the problem of a teenage pregnancy can be resolved in this nonsensical 'happy ever after' way without permanently traumatising and devastating the teenage girl involved? Are they trying to make us believe that life can go back to normal as if nothing has happened? I was so angry by the time the film ended that it was all I could do not to storm out of the cinema in protest. I don't understand how anybody could fall for this incredibly manipulative and completely unbelievable portrayal of a seriously life-changing event. Teresa, Melbourne, Australia"
"khanon","9","3","6","9 November 2008"," Far more interesting and entertaining than I originally thought...
","I have read many, many of the reviews listed here, both good and bad, and can only come to one conclusion: An amazing amount of people either a) have completely forgotten what it's like to be 16, b) have no idea what today's teenagers are like when not in the presence of adults, or c) are being intentionally obtuse about what it's like to be 16.<br/><br/>First, I should say that I'm an over-the-hill father of 2 young ladies, one of which did get pregnant at 16. When I remember that period of our lives and look at the ""Juno"", it came back to me as interestingly realistic without being ""sad"" or ""dismal"". The repartee between Juno and her girlfriend was very realistic, having had the fortune (or misfortune) of overhearing my daughters speaking to their friends here and there. Whomever says that teenagers aren't that sharp and off-beat witty and still being surprisingly naive (almost seemingly on purpose) should pay attention to their teens more often and not just dismiss them out of hand.<br/><br/>It was stated that Juno's father's reactions and attitude were unrealistic, yet I found a serious kinship with the character, as it seemed much like how I was with my daughter when it happened.<br/><br/>The stepmother's reaction to the Ultrasound Technician's nasty comment about a teen parent being ""poisonous"" without knowing anything about her was spot-on. ""We may criticize each other, but we're family and know each other... just who do you think you are to cast aspersion?!"" I found myself saying ""BAM! Way to go!"" during her step-mom's tirade.<br/><br/>I also saw someone mention how Juno's flipping attitudes regarding Bleeker (her child's father and her she-wants-him-to-be boyfriend) and him taking another girl that he's already said he didn't like to the Prom was unrealistic, as well as several of her shifts in attitudes. This is the sign of someone who's never been pregnant nor been around a pregnant woman for any length of time. The hormonal mood shifts from love to hate and all shades in between in the movie are amazingly realistic. I often times found myself forgetting the movie is scripted...<br/><br/>Initially, I didn't want to even watch the movie. One afternoon, there was nothing on On-Demand that I was interested in and queued it up. I couldn't be happier that I did.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 was because they could have gone so much further with it than they did, though what was there was so enjoyable and refreshingly realistic for an indie comedy.<br/><br/>I spent a lot of time here responding to the comments of others, but as I read through the reviews listed here at IMDb, I actually got irate and the ridiculousness of some of the remarks, especially in regard to how Juno spoke, her dad's reactions, her step-mother's attitudes to strangers' criticisms, and calling the potential adoptive father a ""40 year old who hasn't grown up"" when referring to his hobbies. I was unaware that hobbies had upper age limits... If enjoying horror movies and rock music is immature, someone better alert Wes Craven and Mick Jagger that they need to quit their jobs...<br/><br/>I've watched the movie several times now; each time, I find something more in it that I enjoy about it overall. Now, after all that, I do think you need to like this kind of movie to get any real enjoyment out of it, but then that goes for a movie of any genre... I still don't see how anyone enjoyed No Country for Old Men, let alone how it could have gotten best picture over much better works. Shoot, no one even heard of that movie before the awards."

","""I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here and it's obviously a poisonous environment to raise a baby in."" That line is spoken by an ultrasound technician, and anyone who believes that there exists in any hospital, anywhere in the world, a technician who would say that to a patient, is a moron.<br/><br/>As for the rest of this callow, glib film, I hardly know what to, like, say. A high-school junior gets pregnant, but shows not the slightest humanity or vulnerability-- except once, when she complains that her fellow students make fun of her. If they do, there's no evidence of it. She acts, throughout, as though the pregnancy is less of a bother than a passing case of acne.<br/><br/>Ridiculous doesn't begin to cover it."

To add to it, Sonic YOuth is not that great of a band... i have one of their albums and it is ehhhh uhhhh snoooooorrrre.

","It certainly wasn't all that great to tell you the truth...<br/><br/>In all honesty, what it lacked in any type of character growth or maturity it made up for in cliché'.<br/><br/>I suppose that my wife and I have an unfair advantage in watching this, because when we got married, and then found out she was pregnant, we made a decision to give our child up for an open adoption.<br/><br/>So we can realistically tell you step by step the motions and the pregnancy...<br/><br/>However this is Hollywood, and a movie, so we weren't seeing this expecting realism. However for something that everyone was raving about, it would have been nice to see some type of, i don't know, rising action.<br/><br/>For the most part the film was a flat line of sameness over and over again. It was very bland and kinda dull.<br/><br/>Ellen Page, was sarcastic and a typical genX'r the entire time. The characters were pointless and showed no real emotion the entire time, and. Jennifer Garner was a cliché' mom, who was all ""baby baby baby!"".<br/><br/>Both male counterparts, were the most depressing of all. Neither one of them were involved in any aspect of the pregnancy. The fellow who knocked up Juno in the first place, couldn't seem to care less either way.<br/><br/>It was no emotion what so ever, which you could sadly argue is many male reactions, however his character just didn't seem the type to be like. ""Wow, your pregnant... Huh... Well, i have to go jog with my team mates... See you at the end of the film..."" Even Garners husband made very little sense, considering that he was the one who got the ball rolling in the first place.<br/><br/>And that was about it. Every single scene was just one cutting remark after another from EVERYONE. I guess we are supposed to believe that this chick is carrying a child and everday for nine months, all she gets to hear is one snap after another from her mother, her father, and everyone else in her life.<br/><br/>In the end, i just couldn't wait for this film to be over.<br/><br/>Too sarcastic, too cynical, too cliché', and really pointless in the end."
"rhinocerosfive-1","6","5","13","11 April 2008"," the surprise is that everybody's surprised
","Kids get in trouble. Kids are resilient. Kids are smarter than we give them credit for.<br/><br/>All true. And all unveiled in JUNO as if I didn't know. This movie's primarily interesting for its sociological effect: it caused a bunch of people who should know better to act as if the film revealed some real revelation. The revelations for me are that it's not that big a deal for a 16-year-old to get pregnant, and that such a 16-year-old's blasé attitude about the whole thing deserves some sort of approbation. <br/><br/>It's a pleasant enough little movie, well-made if you like pat Hallmark stories with no surprises and annoying post-hip dialog. Ellen Page is a sweet, sympathetic presence, more or less, in a movie that can't help but cloy most of the time. The supporting cast is fine, the direction is mildly intrusive but ultimately palatable. Which is the problem, for me. I don't need sturm und drang, but somebody might mention once in a while that teen pregnancy is no easily disposable, lightly comic matter.<br/><br/>One example of the script's incoherence - its failure to focus on the big issue - is that Juno is more upset about her ex-boyfriend taking another girl to prom than about her own pregnancy. She spends more time concocting trite euphemisms for her condition than pondering the condition itself in any depthful way. Maybe an impregnated teenager would really act this way; maybe she wouldn't or couldn't deal with the severity of her situation. This I find not unlikely. I can't blame the kid for that; she's just a character. But even the birth itself is treated as a lark, with her BFF dancing around making silly faces at the crowning. Sure, Juno weeps later, but she may just as well be weeping for her own discomfort. So I must blame the filmmakers for a dumb, condescending presentation of her muddle.<br/><br/>Much as I hate to mark myself ""curmudgeon,"" I must come down on the side of those a little appalled at the movie's broad irresponsibility. Yeah, somewhat irresponsible as far as its potentially dangerous message to young girls, but most egregiously slack in its responsibility to keep me entertained."
"taranova","6","5","13","1 March 2008"," All Heart, No Substance
","I walked into Juno expecting light comedy, perhaps a tear or two - and that's exactly what I got. My friends and I left the theater talking about it - we all agreed that it was very 'sweet.' But perhaps 'sweet' isn't befitting enough for a movie with such a theme as unplanned pregnancy. Then again, Juno doesn't exactly go anywhere near where it should in heaviness. A very bland tell-not-show mechanism is used in telling the story, and most of the issues vital to a plot are merely foreshadowed and never resolved sufficiently.<br/><br/>Characters are introduced and get their fair share of screen time - but there never seems to be any struggle between them relationship wise. There are many threads in the social web left dangling - Juno and her stepmother, father, and selected adoptive parents of her unborn child. At most, they're realistically portrayed in the way that complications are never explicitly made into the drama they deserve for on screen presentation - but it leaves the whole film relatively dull and anticlimactic.<br/><br/>The good in this film include the actors, namely the girl who played the title role. She far out shined Jennifer Garner, who seemed almost as without taste as the rest of the movie. Perhaps that was just her character. At least with her, there was a real conflict - but too easy a resolution. There wasn't any large bumps in the way. None that she had to climb over herself, anyway.<br/><br/>The music for Juno fits it very well; it sets the tone and gives it part of its charm. The odd, semi romantic lyric content and guitar instrumentals provide a very down to earth but dreamlike background to a suburban setting. They're quite catchy songs, as well.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say Juno earned a 9/10 if it were going for realistic scenarios - a documentary, if you will. Anything else - a six."
"seawalker","6","5","13","28 February 2008"," Could have been much more than a kooky, feelgood, idiosyncratic movie
","This may sound like an awful fudge, but I am not exactly sure how to take ""Juno"".<br/><br/>On the one hand ""Juno"" is really funny, has some great performances (especially from Ellen Page, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) and perfectly picks up on the idiom of smart teenage slang. On the other hand, the story that unfolds is all very nice and neat and tidy, and not nearly conflicted or dramatic enough.<br/><br/>For instance...<br/><br/>Yes, I know it was only a plot device to prevent Juno from going ahead with the termination (no pregnancy, no movie!), but was it really necessary to paint the abortion clinic in such an unpleasant light? Very clichéd, very dull and certainly not the experience I had, a few years ago, when I accompanied my Sister to a similar establishment. It made it too easy for Juno to make the decision that she did.<br/><br/>At the end, would a girl like Juno really have just given up her baby without a second thought, or a glance backwards? Would she have immediately have taken back up with the boy who made her pregnant? What about his feelings? Or his Mother's? What about her parents? They more or less just agreed straight away with what she wanted to do? Way, way too understanding and I didn't believe it. Juno is a smart mouthed, but nice, 16 years old girl. What does a 16 year old girl know, or boy for that matter?<br/><br/>I am writing as though I didn't enjoy ""Juno"", but that is incorrect. I did enjoy ""Juno"", but it could have been much more than a kooky, feelgood, idiosyncratic movie."

The cast was very good unlike some others movies that have some great actors but they do not being the movie to life. This movie does that job and more. I recommend seeing this movie with anyone. Hopefully there will be more movies just like Juno. If every movie was just as alive and funny as Juno it would be awesome. I might see this movie a few more times before it stops showing at the cinema. I have never seen such a small movie be so good. I wonder why it was not put out for release everywhere.

"dalefried","10","5","13","24 November 2007"," How Wonderfully Wrong Could I Have Been
","Since the 2005 awards season dominated by little independent films, the studios have attempted to co-opt the process by periodically designating the Indie film of the moment. Like MTV, the keepers of the pop music gates, the major studios have been preselecting little films occasionally for us to view as the art of the moment. Little Miss Sunshine was the designated little film of 2006, and though nice, was promoted all the way to the major award shows it really didn't deserve. Waitress was an early entry in this derby for 2007, a nice but limited film.<br/><br/>Since exploding at Toronto, Juno has become the designated Indy film for 2007. Major studio buyout, omnipresent theatrical advertising, should win this, should win that talk everywhere. I approached the viewing of this film with a tiny bit of jaundice, fearful that the hipness of the now memorized trailer was seen as mostly a promotional opportunity.<br/><br/>God, was I wrong.<br/><br/>I have to view it again to verify, but this film was staggering. There are so many things to talk about how wonderful it was, but I will point out the two most obvious. This could be the best written film I have seen in years. Though small in scope, the interloping themes swirling around what is a very simple story are driven much further by the wit and wisdom of the words. What an ear this young woman has for turning phrases into significance. One hopes she isn't reduced to the one hit wonder this thing could become.<br/><br/>Then there is the kid. I don't think I have ever seen a film intended mostly for adults with such a dominant performance by a young person. Ellen Page was simply luminous. She is perfect for this role because of her eyes and expressive mouth that created such a terrifying visage in Hard Candy. Almost all of her dialog gains extra pungency from those piercing expressions. Though her always surprising, obtuse responses to questions and situations are played surficially for laughs, they are delivered with an in-character, intelligent sweetness that enchants while cutting to the bone of a whole number of issues in our time. In the end she pulls off the major theme of the film, going to term her way as a statement of almost subversive independence, with a gusto that calms as it persuades. I was of the opinion that Evan Rachel Wood might evolve into the Meryl Streep of the sub-X generation, but I think she may have some major competition in Ms Page.<br/><br/>Of course it could all be an accident of organic connection. A great off-center writer creating her dream off-center character and finding the perfect actress to pull it off. Mix that with a beyond competent director likely too young to get in the way of great material and you have magic.<br/><br/>More is going on here, however. Everything clicks. The shot selections have a ""what's that?"" feel that leaves you thinking after they move on. The perfectly selected songs chirp sub-themes galore and carry a tone that moves between fantasy and a much needed reality-check. The editing has similar dynamics shown in Thank You for Smoking. The other characters carry on somewhat independently likely because of the actors selected, most particularly the step mother who evolves from an adversary to the obvious perfect role model before your very eyes.<br/><br/>But in the end, I feel most a need to experience this film again to reconnect to its intentional, optimistic wisdom that its beyond-their-years writer, director, and most importantly its actress communicate so subtly and effortlessly. Some studio honchos picked a winner. This one deserves all the Awards Season accolades it gets."

Thank God I didn't pay to get into the theater to see this one.<br/><br/>I figured with all the hoopla and critical ravings about how great this independent film was supposed to be and what a fantastic job Ellen Page did as the title character, then it must be a pretty good movie. Boy, was I ever disappointed! Ellen did a decent job of acting but I feel her portrayal of a semi-psycho teen in ""Hard Candy"" was more believable than this. In this movie she acted more like a 20 something that has already gone through living on the streets rather than a 16 year old who would have been scared to death of having a baby.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the boyfriend. Let's just say he looked like he would rather be with Jason Bateman's character than with Ellen Page's character.<br/><br/>Lastly... who, what, and where in the HELL did that God awful music track come from? I literally hated every single song in the movie. It sounded like the producer or director decided to have their nieces and nephews make up crap on the spot and put it to guitar music.<br/><br/>All in all, I would say that this movie is a total waste of time and effort. I hope Ellen Page does not continue to do this kind of crap because I think she could really have a great career ahead of her."
"Chris Knipp","9","6","17","19 December 2007"," A real smart girl comedy
","Like The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Superbad, Juno is partly an offshoot of the now increasingly seminal-seeming TV series ""Freaks and Geeks,"" with a loosely unified point of view, with certain actors recurring, and above all with Judd Apatow as presiding Master of the Revels. That this is, overall, a fortunate turn of affairs for American film comedy has never been more obvious than in the charming and revelatory new film about a teenage girl, Juno.<br/><br/>Juno is a sixteen-year-old in high school who gets pregnant. She's an extension of Linda Cardellini's ""Freaks"" character, Lindsay. She's not quite a Freak or a Geek, but she refuses to conform and she's provocative, articulate, and aware she doesn't know who she is yet. In her every burst of repartee Juno's striving to define herself, stay honest and sane, and not take any crap off anybody. The important thing is the character more than the issue, though it's the measure of the fluidity and smarts of the writing that you can't really separate the two.<br/><br/>Though his character Paulie is marvelously understated, Michael Cera, the tall young Canadian who's also one of the principals of Superbad, also defines the frame of reference a little differently from previous comedies. He's Juno's boyfriend--or her non-boyfriend, because that's still undecided too, and he's the father of her child. He's not a bad guy nor is he capable of making things alright. He's just a kid, like her. But he's sweet and decent. Juno tells him he behaves well and makes it look easy. But he says actually he works really hard at it.<br/><br/>After an icky visit to an abortion clinic and a chat with an Asian classmate picketing it, Juno and her girlfriend Lea (Olivia Thirby) decide she's going to have the baby and they find a yuppie couple seeking adoption in a local free paper. When Juno visits Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) they're yuppies living in a McMansion, but they're sincere. Right away Juno bonds alarmingly with Mark, because he's a musician, even if he's sold out, writing for commercials.<br/><br/>We can't tell how this all pans out because Juno is first of all a journey with surprising bumps along the way, but aside from the very funny, very smart writing throughout by Diablo Cody (that's a lady) and the fact that Ellen Page's sharp tongue is sweetened by the fact that she's completely adorable, this movie is rounded out by alternative points of view. Juno's dad (a very strong J.K. Simmons) is wholly supporting, but she has a stepmother (""The West Wing's"" Allison Janney) whose remarks are tinged with acid. Most importantly for a good while in the middle Vanessa and Mark draw the viewer's attention. How are they handling all this? What does it mean to have to adopt? What strains is their marriage under? The movie takes a good look at them before going back to Juno.<br/><br/>""Freaks and Geeks"" ends with members of the two groups hanging out together. To begin with Lindsay was a bit of both. If she hung out with the Freaks, her younger brother Sam, the number two character, was 100% Geek. Paulie is a kind of geek: he does extremely well in school. But he's also a jock, perpetually seen in running togs or with the cross country team. The essence of the ""Freaks and Geeks"" point of view is that though categorizing in youth is a relentless social process, categories are essentially limiting and false.<br/><br/>Juno comes across as smarter and less lame than Knocked Up. It's not a fat Jewish boy's fantasy of being accepted by a cute girl. It's ending is a bit of a cop-out, but essentially what matters is the way the prevailing voice encompasses young attitudes and realities As in the Apatow comedies the message remains that it's hip and okay to be a good person. But since this is a collective kind of comedy that's been emerging, there's no one truth and some of the scenes and ideas in Juno too are lame while some others are exceptionally humorous and witty.<br/><br/>These new comedies are cool: they devise a loose system where it's hard to go wrong, and Juno goes particularly right. This is the real woman's version of Knocked Up: that's why the title is the name of the girl. Juno remains Junoeven ""knocked up."" This is the essential point. How Mark and Vanessa turn out is left hanging. The ending feels a little bit incomplete. Partly this is TV series thinking, where it's assumed there's always another episode coming along later to tie up loose ends. It's in the classic nature of comedy to embrace people and reconcile us to things. Juno like the best new American comedies provides a framework to see contemporary reality and embrace it. Director Jason Reitman, whose first film, Thank You for Smoking, was more satirical and political, has come into the fold.<br/><br/>When Juno's had her baby, she and Paulie go back to playing in a band together. In high school, it's a lot better when music is the most important thing, not having babies. Yes, this is ""feel-good"" stuff, but it's smart, even if its sitcom-casual structure has some holes in it. Maybe Apatow has peaked as a comedy impresario with this one. Word is out that he takes a dive with Walk Hard."

","I really wanted to love this movie, so maybe that's why it disappointed me. I loved the supporting characters, and really liked Ellen Page as Juno, but felt the story/character tried too hard, too obviously to be ""cool."" Juno was great as a cynical, hard-ass high-schooler, but the rest of her life was not consistent with her own. The school scenes, with disapproving teens swarming away from Juno....come on.... I went to high school in the late 70s and no one reacted that way, no students at least. Allison Janney, Ellen Page, the actor who played the father were all excellent. The adoptive parents had roles which the actors, or the writing, couldn't sustain... I suspect it was the writer....."

","Reading reviews by critics, a common idea seems to be the one that it's a ""cool"" light in which to portray teenagers ""accurately"". Wrong. I'm 18 years old and was disgusted by the creation of stupid slang words in the script in a bid to sound quirky. It's so sure of being ""down with the kids"" , instead only proving how it doesn't get the younger generation at all. The basic plot and morals - that was fine. Teenage pregnancy is always full of tough decisions and it's an important issue. I wouldn't be one to come away sure that what Juno had decided was wrong or right, it's up to the individual person. Performance from Jennifer Garner was nice enough but I was relieved when ""Inception"" came out and I saw that Ellen Page was actually capable. I don't think the script was her friend, and it well and truly screwed up the movie for me. If I hear one more critic describe it as ""cool"" or ""quirky""... well, they're wrong."
"dierregi","2","4","10","10 July 2010"," Smug teenager gets pregnant and lives happily ever after
","When this film came out in the midst of Oscar-hype, for about 5 minutes I considered going to the cinema to watch it. However, I have plenty of experience of over-hyped movies being nearly unwatchable. Besides, something about the plot did not ring true and I am not that interested in teenage pregnancy anyway. Eventually, I saw a photo of the scriptwriter, Diablo Cody (never heard of a stupider fake name) wearing leopard print and looking smug and I knew this movie was going to be a turkey.<br/><br/>Fast-forward three years, and Juno was on TV. Guess what? I was right. Basically, I hated it because of all the things mentioned separately in other ""hate"" reviews and I am grateful to fellow reviewers who pointed out every single annoying aspect of this movie. To summarize them all: 1) Ellen Page is cute and – perhaps – a good actress but incredibly annoying, arrogant and smug; 2) almost every line she delivers rings false (scriptwriting lingo nobody could churn out at that speed); 3) her parents and friends are equally annoying; 4) the soundtrack is abominable. Even if Juno is supposed to like punk rock, our ears are abused by silly, kiddie rock songs, performed by a female singer I'd like to strangle 5) but most of all, if Juno is really that smart, how come she does not know anything about birth control?<br/><br/>What else? There is no controversy or debate about teenage pregnancy. The only two weak attempts to give a ""controversial"" context are: 1) a stupid-looking, pro-life supporter standing outside an abortion clinic mentioning that ""Foetuses already have fingernails"" and convincing Juno to change her mind. FYI: monkeys too, have fingernails. 2) a comment from a ultrasound lab technician, mentioning the fact that teenagers might not be good mothers. Juno step-mum (another arrogant piece of work) verbally assaults the technician declaring that teenagers are actually great mothers, or some similar crap.<br/><br/>Finally, if what we hear is actually ""normal"" teenage slang (as somebody mentioned) I am not surprised our society is going down the drain, so jaded and conceited these teenagers sound and so unable to control or give good advice their parents seem to be. Not the worst movie of all times, but certainly ranking high in that category."

The humor was well placed and not overbearing, I don't think there was any moments that dragged at all. The soundtrack was wonderfully arranged with various tunes that will make me look for the soundtrack. This is not meant to be a kiss-up or anything but I must say it was an enjoyable evening.

"napierslogs","4","5","14","9 July 2010"," Can't live up to its undeserving expectations
","The problem with ""Juno"" is Juno. Juno (Ellen Page) is our main character, a high school teenager that gets pregnant. Shenanigans, as she says, emanate.<br/><br/>I adhere to the school of thought that in film, main characters should be likable, or that we can at least relate to or empathize with in some way, but Juno doesn't inhabit any qualities of a good character. She is not similar to any real high school teenagers, and has that ultra-cool, I'm-smarter-and-better-than-everybody-else vibe that young adults only wish they were like. We are to know that Juno is really, really smart – (just ignore the fact that she accidentally got pregnant) – we can tell by her speech. Unfortunately, the dialogue is not smart writing. It's just pop-culture persiflage and quick witted repartee. It may be funny, but it's not smart - especially when no actual teenagers talk like that. Then, to hide the fact that Juno is not a complete character, they have her listen to cool, indie music. But someone must have forgotten to tell writer Diablo Cody that listening to cool, indie music does not automatically add dimension or emotion to a character. That's supposed to be done through a character's actions, reactions as they evolve over the course of the film. None of which are demonstrated in Juno. To be clear, for all of the faults with the character of Juno, none of the blame is to be placed on Ellen Page. Unanimously heralded to be the next great actress, that is just a matter of time.<br/><br/>Apart from the lack of an integral character in Juno, the film certainly has some positives. Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons play Juno's step-mother and father. They could very well be the best parents displayed in the teen, pregnancy genre. Janney adds depth and humour to a character that turns out to be not your cliché step-mother; while Simmons adds heart and humour to a father that steers clear of melodrama but can still provide the adjective 'heartfelt' to the film. Also starring Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner, who are both accomplished actors, their characters are exactly as you expect them to be. Which are fine characters, but they don't provide the platforms for Juno's supposed maturation.<br/><br/>If it weren't for the fact that ""Juno"" was the recipient of an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for screenwriter Diablo Cody, it would have been forgotten as just a flash-in-the-pan with some funny lines and a young Ellen Page. But just as America fell to the charms of its marketing team, the Academy fell to the charms of another stripper-turned-screenwriter, and we have a sub-par film getting lauded as one of the best ever. ""Juno"" may have some good acting, and great supporting characters and humour and heart, but from everything pointed above it's lacking too much to be deserving of its Best Original Screenplay win. A year later, the Academy snubbed John Patrick Shanley's ""Doubt"" – now that's a film with complex, multi-dimensional characters and layers of meaning into a seemingly simple story. ""Juno"" doesn't even come close to that kind of brilliant writing. (Normally such a comparison can not be made but when they are nominated for the same award and both attempt a multi-meaning story arc with engaging characters the comparison somehow becomes valid but of course not fair).<br/><br/>Watch ""Juno"" if you like the teen comedy, pregnancy kind of film and enjoy it for what it offers, but don't expect it to live up to its hype."

","Juno Macguff is a sixteen year old teenage girl who faces unexpected pregnancy and makes absurd decisions regarding her unborn baby. <br/><br/>This is an exceptional film. A movie like this comes once or twice every year. A low budget and subtle movie but then becomes exponentially popular. <br/><br/>At first I had low expectations for this movie and it was for reasons. One reason is that the cast is fledgling and the second and main reason was because of who wrote it (no offense). <br/><br/>But seeing it winning an academy award and hearing all the hype about it led me to finally give it a shot. And boy, was I wrong about this movie. I was in a complete awe. What makes Juno exceptional is the fact that the main character, though facing many problems both internal and external, manages to fix a smile on her face and acts as if the whole thing was just a joke. Many other pictures with the same tone of teenage pregnancy all have one aim, and that is to show the audience the darker side of teenage pregnancy and possibly try to make us cry and no laughs.<br/><br/>however, in the case of Juno, the main character, Juno, was both hilarious and the audience felt sorry for her at the same time. There were lots of laughs, sarcasm, and indeed sobs."

","I heard the hype. When there's hype, there is usually a problem. Usually. After seeing the film, i have to admit that the music exited with me, humming happily in my head, as i went out of the theater doors. I'm all for well done soundtracks, and, thanks to Wes Anderson, everyone these days is getting on board the ""Be Hip and Use Obscure Bands"" train. Fine. Whatever. The film itself, however, wanted very much to be a good film, and fell very short of actually being a good film. The writing was contrived, trite, disappointing. Ellen Page was unbelievably annoying for the first half, and managed to raise her character's ability to endear the spectator to ""barely dealable"" by the second half. What is really frustrating, is that once again, i have to be the apparent ""arbitrarian"" who didn't like the film. ""Garden State"" all over again. And, this thing is being nominated all over town! Here is the difference between being real, and wanting to be real. ""No Country For Old Men,"" for example, did not WANT to be a great film, it simply WAS a great film. The Brothers Coen do not WANT to be great directors, they simply ARE great directors. Everyone wants to be so hip and cool these days, that they'll watch Johnny Awesome chuck a turd on the lawn and tell the neighborhood it's ""rad."" The next day, sure as the sun has risen...that turd is awesome! Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Hollywood is searching high and low, intruding upon, and sending in undercover cool people to wrench away, from the underbelly cultures, anything of worth...Independent=mainstream. We say it here...it comes out there....Anyway, the soundtrack, and Michael Cera and Jason Bateman, saved this floating turd from sinking all of the way to the far below...Nice work."

The second time that I had the privilege of viewing this piece of art, I began to see how truly amazing the movie was. And the third time that I saw this honestly honest movie, I fell in love with it completely.<br/><br/>After getting home from the first viewing of this film, on Christmas Eve, mind you, I bought the entire album on my computer. All together, this movie's soundtrack is Juno. Kimya Dawson's songs represent the plot as well as Juno's personality to a T. Mott the Hoople is a great band, and Belle and Sebastian is a wonderful addition. The songs are truly individual and a beautiful part of this wonderful film.<br/><br/>The cast is brilliant, with Ellen Page, who really IS Juno, Michael Cera, J.K. Simmons, Allison Janney, and a hilarious appearance by the Office's Rainn Wilson, making the movie what it is.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie will make you laugh, will make you cry, if you're my mother, and will make you wonder how this movie is still amazingly neutral on the point of Pro-Life/Pro-Choice.

","One of my biggest annoyances is when people try to be different or off-base simply to send a message to society that they are different. There is no need to flaunt the fact that you beat to a different drum, and many times it is only for attention, so other people can think ""yeah, wow, they're really just different than everybody else... they're artsy, they're cool, they know exactly who they are."" that's bull. (this is applying to the writers/producers or whatever and their music and perception of high school life and society)... anyway, I was quite annoyed with Juno's character. it is NOT GOOD when watching a movie and you find yourself knowing that it is scripted. don't get me wrong, much of the dialogue was very funny, and I love sarcasm and wit as much as the next guy, if not more, but NOT when it is not believable. Juno's lines were way over the top and for me, simply unrealistic, while almost every other character seemed to be ""normal"". now this has to be the writer(s) trying to portray their ""independent"" lives and flaunting their ""differentness"" to the world with Juno's ridiculous attitude, behavior, and clothing. I found myself very confused as to the identity of this movie and what they were trying to do. I see, a very serious subject matter (pregnancy, abortion, adoption) laced with humor and sarcasm to lighten the mood or to mask true feelings or even fear and uncertainty. I call shenanigans on many people who rave about how they can relate so much to these characters... i will admit that of course there are really people out there who may be just like Juno, but it is very unbelievable to hear so many people say they feel that way. This is a good movie, with a good concept, and Ellen Page did a great job as an actress, but Juno the character was, let's say, horrendous. Even if Juno's dialogue was toned down just a bit with a little less quirky one-liner, off-beat phrases and a little more seriousness (you're pregnant! and yes, I know some will say ""oh but that's just her defense mechanism... well it was way overblown). I couldn't tell whether this movie wanted to be a comedy or a fable. I can definitely see a combination being worked out quite well, but I do not think that they succeeded in this instance."

Once you get used to it, it starts to feel right to hear these characters talking this way. Like it's a necessary part of this quirky world that Diablo Cody has created.<br/><br/>This has to be the most twee story about teen pregnancy ever written, and you won't enjoy the movie if you cannot accept that fundamental fact.

"Webstuhl","10","3","7","18 August 2008"," Entertaining and cute - and extremely desperately trying to be hip and indie
","I think there are two major problems with this movie. <br/><br/>The first thing is that the movie really tries to be cute on the one hand, but one the other deep and moving. Therefore those two aspects somehow collide into kitsch. The characters, even the married couple often cited as the ""only convincing and authentic characters"" in this movie are not realistically portrayed. I mean the problems all those characters are going through are extremely hard to get by. It's way more complicated, especially a teenage pregnancy followed by adoption can lead to serious problems. I just think that its not convincing that Juno or bleek didn't even wanted to see the child. Also the dialogue seems often stylized which can be annoying at times.<br/><br/>Then the other problem is that Juno is desperate to look like a independent movie, ""stealing"" from both - indie-rock and indie-film-culture. there are plenty of references to rock-culture that are rather superficial and pointless than smart and subversive. Every Minute of the movie you see that they somehow try to create those authentic aesthetics indie-movies often have and also tries to appear as a film with rather complex relationship dynamics. However, it doesn't work. This is an good olé Hollywood flick, i would even call it family entertainment. It cannot hide the fact that it is. People expecting something else will eventually be disappointed.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the movie has many strong points (I remember myself saying """"this is the best movie ever""). I loved the movie for its dry humor. The dialogue may be stylized, but is also quick and refreshing, making you laugh and thinking ""geez, why can't people in real life talk like this?"".

Due to the pacing and bare-bones approach, I can understand how this might not be everyone's cup of tea, but to attempting to justify disliking this film by calling it unrealistic smacks of insecurity. <br/><br/>To those who feel that the dialogue is unrealistic, well, you must not know many teenagers! If you did you'd know that they speak (amongst themselves especially) in a dialect all their own, and they do it effortlessly and constantly. The dialect varies due to regional, ethnic, and class differences, but Junospeak is appropriate to a certain middle class suburban/small city/large rural community in the midwestern or western US. Would every teenager drop cultural, literary and musical reference at a machine gun pace? No, but the small percentage that does actually prides itself on the ability in such a way that they secretly (and obsessively) practice and research the habit. The reason that this film is perceived as having a certain agenda is not because it has one, but because it doesn't! It is distinct because most Hollywood films DO, and the fact that this film is not in lock step makes it appear to have its own agenda. <br/><br/>Overall, you may or may not like this film, but I think that there is very little in the script, directing, or acting (which is extremely strong) that you can fairly say is not well-done, and therefore deserving of the praise that many have heaped upon this movie."

Although, I hope that some teenage girls don't get the idea that having a pregnancy then finding a home for your baby is something simple and easy, to the point that they don't need to worry.<br/><br/>The movie was shot in Canada, and the boyfriend is played by another Canadian, expertly, by Michael Cera as the studious and nerdy Paulie Bleeker.

Part of that is caused by his becoming distant from Vanessa, developing into their intent to divorce. This shatters Juno's ideal, wondering ""why can't people stay together?"" Still, in the end Vanessa as a single parent adopts the baby and all will end well. And, Juno finds out that she really cares for Paulie.<br/><br/>Sept 2012 edit: Just saw it again, still an excellent movie, good to re-watch every 2 to 4 years."
"voguesims","9","3","7","6 May 2008"," It's just a movie...
","The first time I remember seeing anything about 'Juno' was at Christmastime of 2007 while watching the commercials on TV. Being who I am I was very immediately curious. I only just saw it a couple of weeks ago... twice in one weekend, and it is one of those movies I could watch again. Being a teenager in today's society, you're exposed to a lot of these kinds of things. While I'm going to admit that 'Juno' doesn't totally express how difficult of a situation this really and honestly is, especially since my own family has experienced teenage pregnancy and adoption in its history, at a time where it was no more smiled at than it is now, I found the movie to be enjoyable.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of comments on here bashing the actions of Juno and her parents, her friends, and sometimes even the very misguided Paulie Bleeker, the music, and so on. I actually enjoyed the music and found a great many of the things that the characters express remotely or truly believable... do some teenagers talk like that? Yes, they talk like that; they have sex, they drink, they do tons of other things that they shouldn't be doing but they manage to do anyways. I was actually very happy about the way Juno's father and stepmother were shown to be supportive of her. If a girl gets into that kind of situation, the least you could do if you were their parent, is to be a parent. Just because kids do these kinds of things nowadays, doesn't directly imply that their parents are messed up... but in most situations, it most certainly can.<br/><br/>The other thing I think about this is the way that people talk about ""what is the message we're giving 16-year-olds?"" Read the tag line: it may not be the most humorous, witty tag line you ever saw, but 'Juno' is, believe it or not, a comedy and that's what I'll stick by. You can't base your opinions about what is right or wrong on the media, not in today's modern world, and you can't base them off of a COMEDY. Most likely, the people who see this movie already have their own opinions about teenage sex. Personally, I consider it a bad idea - you get into situations like this, don't you, if not similarly unpleasant? Who does it really benefit? But as long as I know what's right and not let a movie decide that for me, then I'm going to say... just enjoy it, or not, whatever you personally choose.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of movies, nowhere near a record-braking, couch potato type could see, but Juno is definitely one of the movies I'll hold onto. Remember... not all characters or stories are perfect. That's why we're human. I'm beginning to believe this may surpass Titanic in the ""Movie Everybody Loves to Hate"" category."
"genieinabottle","9","3","7","2 May 2008"," real life ride
","Just finished watching that movie. I found it enjoyable and it made me feel good about life. I was especially impressed by the way Juno handles her sensitive situation. Unexpected pregnancy at such an early age is something that may be too much for a teenage girl and she could easily crack up. However, Juno weighs up the options available to her. She has to choose between abortion, having the baby and putting it up for adoption or raising it by herself. The last option isn't really considered and at first she wants to have an abortion but soon she decides against it. Her close friend suggests finding a foster family for the baby in one of the ads from married couples wanting to adopt a baby. Unfortunately, the couple she chooses isn't going to become a wonderful family she longs to provide for the baby. Juno becomes disappointed and wonders about the relationships people have. That's when she gets closer with the father of her baby. She starts to notice the things about him that she didn't see before, and she falls in love with him. First she regarded him as just a friend she happened to have sex with, but now she finds that they really could be together. <br/><br/>The movie is very optimistic. It shows that a pregnancy at a very early age is not the end of the world and a pregnant teen doesn't have to choose only between abortion and struggling to raise the baby by herself. She can have the baby and give it away to a couple that will take care of it. That way, the girl can go on with her life as a typical teenager and at the same time she can fulfill the dreams of people who cannot have a baby but would love to adopt one. <br/><br/>I liked the reaction of Juno's parents to the news about her daughter getting pregnant. They didn't condemn her at all. On the contrary, they proved very supportive of her and helped her deal with the situation she found herself in. <br/><br/>I found the movie very uplifting. It shows us that even in such difficult circumstances you can find the right solution."

","Juno is a cute brilliant tale about a teenage girl, Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), who's faced with an unexpected pregnancy, and enlists the aid of her best friend in finding the unborn child a suitable home in this coming-of-age comedy drama from Thank You for Smoking director Jason Reitman.<br/><br/>At first I thought it was a cheesy chick-flick, but truly, I was astounded especially by the fantastic role of Ellen Page who definitely, or in other words, should've won the Oscar for best performance by an actress in a leading role. This film was nominated for 4 Oscars including best direction Jason Reitman, best picture Lianne Halfon, Mason Novick, and Russell Smith. Also including best original screenplay Diablo Cody, and best actress Ellen Page. All of the main and major categories of the academy awards. But just won one for best screenplay original! Which really surprised me. And when this masterful teenage genuine classic released on DVD, I bought it for my family to enjoy that night. Turns out, it was perfect. The humor was continuous and hysterical. The pace was of the picture was very well layed-out. And, with Page's performance, she gave you deep inside emotions when the story continued on into a more emotionally draining picture. Then went straight back to the comedy Juno just has a blast with as the audience rapidly soars into the teenage world of MacGuff's extraordinary bizarre high school life.<br/><br/>Juno is my 3rd favorite film of all time, next to Schindler's List and Lord of the Rings 1. I was extremely surprised this masterpiece never won best picture. Because from my opinion, I thought it was better than No Country for Old Men. And when Page never won that Oscar, I was truly disappointed, but other than that. Juno is not the, but one of the best motion picture's of all time. But for its category and genre, it is the best. Highly entertaining, and greatly recommended even for people who don't enjoy chick flicks, you'll still like it. Breathtaking movie masterpiece."
"BremenDruid","9","3","7","19 April 2008"," A funny, yet heart-warming tale.
","I never thought that I would not only be able to sit through a full length movie dealing with teenage pregnancy, but also come away wanting to watch it over and over again. In comes ""Juno"" showing me that it's entirely possible. Juno MacGuff is a 16 year old high school junior who gets impregnated by her best friend Paulie Bleeker. In this turn of events she decides to first go for an abortion (which she could not go through because of a harrowing freak-out regarding fingernails) and then decides to have the baby and give it up for adoption. The story revolves around this decision and her problems along the way, dealing with her family, her friends, and the adoptive parents. The thing about Juno is that it's funny when it has to be and it's emotional when it has to be. It's a perfect blend that brings you into the life of Juno MacGuff, and in the end you want to stay there, because even if it isn't perfect you can still feel the love between the characters. From the talk Juno has with her father and the advise he gives her, or the way Paulie finds and comforts Juno in the hospital after she gave birth, or Vanessa's first time holding Juno's child as her son. This movie outlines every form of love in a way that doesn't make the movie feel overly mushy. Every actor and actress (including the amazing Ellen Page) displays emotions on screen that is so lifelike that it's almost like you were there in person and not watching an acted scene. This is coming from a man who enjoys watching Terminator 2 and Live Free or Die Hard, and yet I loved watching Juno over and over again, each time I felt that I couldn't help but get sucked back into it. But as it is with all great movies, you either love it or you hate it. But it is a movie that I feel is worth watching, even the sixth or thirtieth time."

","I'm tired of seeing so many teenage flicks like American pie or scary movie around. It's was refreshing to find a film for this age with some intelligent dialogue. Ellen Page's character reminded me a lot of an old friend from school. Witty, bored and cynical. I really enjoyed Juno, and while clearly the film does deal with pretty serious issues, I wasn't overwhelmed. It's light-hearted approach was enjoyable. <br/><br/>I actually watched the film with my Dad, we both found it to be highly amusing, more amusing though was an older man in front of us who was continually turning around throughout...he couldn't work out why we were laughing. <br/><br/>I think the trick is not to think to hard about the underlying themes, just go to be entertained."
"gradyharp","8","3","7","17 April 2008"," A Complex Tale Told with Humor, Tenderness, and Simplicity
","Teenage pregnancy is frequently a starting point for myriad philosophical arguments: some see it as a major problem, some see it as an argument for the need of early teaching of contraceptive technique and sex education, some see it as a reason for championing abortion, and some see it as a piece of life that confronts families in both positive and negative ways. JUNO is a beautifully written (Diablo Cody) and directed (Jason Reitman) version of unplanned pregnancy offered by a splendid ensemble cast: it is a movie that could modify the sociologic outlook of many people in a very strong fashion. <br/><br/>Juno (Ellen Page) is sixteen and talks her best friend Bleek (Michael Cera) into having sex: the result is a surprise pregnancy that Juno shares with her girlfriend Leah (Olivia Thirley) and the store clerk Rollo (Rainn Wilson) even before informing Bleek, a likable kid who seems fairly flat about the situation. After discarding abortion as a viable solution, Juno informs her father (JK Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney) of her status, and tells them she is going to complete the pregnancy and give the baby to some loving and needy barren couple. Her parents are at first flustered by the news, but quickly become supportive in a way that tells us many things about the durability of successful families. With Leah's help, Juno answers an ad for 'wanted: baby' in PennySaver and visits the Lorings (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) who desperately want a child and embrace Juno's gesture of adoption with eager excitement. The remainder of the film follows Juno as her abdomen increases in girth, finding new respect for her parents and for Bleek, and inadvertently walking in the troubled waters of the Loring's marital discord. Without giving the story away, the ending is so tender and free of cliché that it allows us, the audience, to appreciate all the vigor and sensitivity and humor and warmth of Juno - an example of developing maturity that is a fresh breeze compared to the usual teenage movies. <br/><br/>Ellen Page does indeed deliver a pitch perfect performance, but her co-stars are equally fine: Simmons and Janney break away from their usual type cast roles brilliantly, and the other members of the cast (the entire cast) flesh out this well written story with great skill. The mixture of animated graphics and the imaginative musical score enhance the flavor of the tale. JUNO offers an unbiased look at the topic of teenage pregnancy and wins on every level. Grady Harp"
"ironman817","9","3","7","17 April 2008"," A refreshing change from the usual garbage comedy
","What a pleasure it is to see a comedy that was witty and fun and also sweet and touching. I have not met a person that didn't like it. The conventional criticism of Juno is that it's dialog and characters are too snappy, too mature for their years. I think adults today have little idea of the sophistication of many of today's kids. Exposure to the internet has changed everything. If you want to talk about what will never happen, how about Seth Rogan matched up with Katherine Heigl in Knocked Up. Sorry but no woman could ever be that drunk. No man would ever get away with his behavior towards her. I think to of how I have suffered over the years in Adam Sandler or Jim Cary movies. Please no more! For a long time I thought movie comedy was dead and then along came Sideways, Little Miss Sunshine and Juno. Maybe there is hope for the future. Maybe we can have real comedies that make us laugh while trying to tell a real story. You will not find this kind of wit on the walls of public bathrooms and that is more than I can say for the 40 year old virgin or knocked up."

She certainly wasn't a normal and average teen. The movie would have been boring is she weren't a quirky oddball.<br/><br/>Hopefully, this film doesn't give the feeling that teen pregnancy is ""cool"". It certainly is something to be avoided even if it means putting off becoming ""sexuallly active"" until one is equipped to cope with it.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is definitely a movie to see and experience for its own sake.

","I genuinely think that my love for this movie is forming to an addiction. I like this movie mostly because of Juno's choice to give the baby up for adoption. Considering that this movie has a high percentage of teenagers in the target audience, I think it's great to advocate with actually advocating other options. So many young girls get abortions and regret them without really thinking about other options. I also like that she takes responsibility.<br/><br/>Ellen Page is excellent in this movie. Some people think that the character of Juno is too stereotypically emotastic, however, there are people like that out there, as Ellen Page had a lot of input on the development of Juno.<br/><br/>See this movie if you haven't yet. It's worth it."

","The supposed taboo of teenage pregnancy is tackled full on in this smartly-written but still hugely enjoyable comedy. Rising star Ellen Page plays Juno, the girl in question, who discovers that she is pregnant at the age of 16. At first, she wants to abort it, but soon decides the best thing to do is give it up for adoption. Written by Diablo Cody, who has gained mass amounts of publicity for her previous career as an exotic dancer, Juno combines jug-loads of wit and charm with a brilliant cast featuring the ever watchable JK Simmons as the smart-but-firm father, Jennifer Garner as the uptight but well-meaning adopter-mother and Michael Cerna, who carries over his awkward nerd shtick, perfected in such laugh-a-thons as TV cult series Arrested Development and gross-out comedy Superbad. Although some have complained the dialogue is unrealistically smart for pre-graduate high-schoolers, you will lose yourself in the story too much to bother caring."
"inkblot11","10","3","7","12 April 2008"," With a story and script that are light years above most others, don't put off a showing of this film, as I did!
","Juno (Ellen Page) is a sixteen year old student who lives with her blue-collar, kindly father (J.K. Simmons), her down to earth stepmother (Allison Janney) and her little half-sister, Liberty Bell. Although she is smart, funny and cute, she is not a member of the ""in-crowd"" at school but exists on the fringes in her own unique way. A crush on a fellow classmate of the cross country team leads to a sexual encounter that leads, in turn, to an unwanted pregnancy. What to do? Her first thought is abortion but, once at the clinic, she can't follow through, as a classmate-activist tells her that even fetuses have fingernails. That leaves her with few real choices so, very sensibly, Juno tells her parents of the situation and informs them that she is already seeking a nice couple to adopt the baby. One day soon after, her father accompanies her to the would-be adoptive parents lush home. Upon meeting the Lorings, they seem ideal. Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) is a lovely businesswoman who confesses that she was ""made"" to be a mother but is unable to have children of her own. Husband Mark (Justin Bateman), also, seems kind, intelligent, and ""cool"", that is, he has a music room with classic guitars, etc., and he writes melodies for advertising commercials out of their home. A contract is signed and everyone begins to wait for the perfect outcome of Juno's pregnancy. But, will everything, indeed, be perfect or is reality about to come calling? This brief description can NOT convey the true wonderment of this film. Yes, this is an outline sketch of events but the awesome script, by Diablo Cody, that embellishes the story is so funny, the buttons of your own pants will come flying off between spasms of laughter! From the fellow science lab student who says she can't concentrate today due to a ""menstral migraine"" or the convenience store owner chiding Juno for shaking her pregnancy test stick ""it's not an etch-a-sketch!"", this is a screenplay that is lights years above most others. In fact, the great one-liners come so quickly that a second showing will be a requirement! Then, too, the performances are great, with the petite Page leading the way. But, the film is much more than a laugh or two, as it tackles a touchy subject, teenage pregnancy, and treats it lovingly, with humanity, dignity, and naked reality. If you have put off a showing of this film, for whatever reason, don't delay any longer! This is a film that, absolutely, confirms that life is worth living and that our connections to others are the means to help us through it."
"greenylennon","10","3","7","7 April 2008"," Juno in translation
","The comedy who triumphed at Rome Film Festival finally got to Italy, accompanied by Fox's great box office expectations, although I'm nearly totally sure ""Juno"" will flop here: for example, in my local theater there were only twelve people or maybe less. I don't care about it, because I enjoyed every little scene. The dialogue's translation tried to maintain the original liveliness, and even if they could result less hilarious than in English, I think a good job has been done: in fact, it mustn't be a very easy process. Ellen Page deserved completely the Oscar nomination: her simplicity, her passion, her sweetness and her irony trasude from every line, bringing a new light to the screen. Instead, Jennifer Garner really surprised me: she showed noteworthy acting skills that comic-book movies never require, and she made Vanessa's character natural and nicer. I cared for Vanessa as much as I cared for Juno. The movie doesn't take a clear position about unplanned pregnancies, but I felt as if Diablo Cody and Jason Reitman wanted to say that those are personal choices that mustn't be questioned, that's why I thank them. They gave me emotions I'll never forget."

It felt Canadian, in other words without ridiculous clichés and everyone being in constant competition for money, attention, coolness or anything like that. It had a plot, too. And I didn't feel I watched a comedy. I mean, yeah, the characters are funny sometimes, but that's just like talking to a friend that says something pleasant, and you smile because you feel good, not because you consider your friends part of your entertainment.<br/><br/>That's about it. If you liked Donnie Darko or Hatley High, this felt like a combination of the two. Without the psychotic bunny, I mean. It was a good movie and I am glad it took several awards this year, but I don't think it was too great either. Could have helped if I didn't dislike Hard Candy so much."

Although I didn't completely fall head over the heel for this movie (like the most people out there). But I can't help but fell in love with every single character in this little wonder.<br/><br/>Made no mistake about it, Ellen Page as titular character, Juno, is totally own this movie. It's really surprised to see these wonderful cast (Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons) build around this amazing 21-years-old actress. I once said in the review of ""Hard Candy"" that - trust me, she will be a star. I never thought that it will be this soon.<br/><br/>There is no problem with this movie at all. The songs are perfect (just like ""Garden State's Original Soundtrack"" which came to my mind). The script is sharp and funny (by former stripper to Oscar-winning writer, Diablo Cody). It was directed by very promising young director, Jason Reitman (Thank You for Smoking). But, maybe it's just me, I'm kind of feel the vibe of manipulation along the way. The world is so bright around Juno's world. She learned her lesson and stay with a person who can ""share her ups and downs"". I mean, that's very rare to happen with a 16-years old girl who unexpectedly got herself pregnant, right? Well, that's movie. It's a make believe machine. When someone is so irresistible or likable as Juno, one cannot help but hope for something wonderful happening to her life. It's wishful thinking that can elude you from the real world we live in for a little while. No harm in that, right? <br/><br/>Ps. Ellen Page is kind of look like Thai people. I mean she could walk around here without noticing she's western."

","Kudos to Cody Diablo for penning something so strategically humorous we almost forget it is about one of the biggest social problems occurring in our time. Of course we can find lots of tragedy in teen pregnancy but why should we keep going there? The script was witty, and clever even though very peppered with clichés and overly mature dialog for teens to be speaking. Yes there are mature teens but way too many of them in this film. But there was definitely the youthful essence and naiveté present at key moments in the film and the cast was perfect and the humor fresh and not re-hashed from other teen dramas that we are so tired of seeing. I know a lot of people who did not like this because they wanted to see a ""message"" to teen girls, or something to instill fear in them about becoming pregnant.

",".....until you go home and start pondering. In a way, this is an eye opener, although it is likely an unrealistic depiction of what the world is like today. You would want it to be  entirely rational/sensible teenagers, saintly understanding/sympathetic parents (and even step-parents), liberal-minded and tolerant communities.<br/><br/>A 16-year-old getting into sex motivated not just by curiosity but also by true love does not panic at the unexpected pregnancy but deals with it rationally. A brief attempt to ""procure a hasty abortion"" (her very words, spoken with businesslike calm - imagine the clinic receptionist at the other end of the line) is soon abandoned. The movie makers dare to abandon also the two alternatives that are entirely expected: the protagonist either wails and hails and does something foolish or is moved by a glorified natural parental love instinct and decides to keep and raise the baby (a sentimental choice). Here, we have Juno, cool and rational, assessing the situation logically, and startin to look for a good couple that will give the baby everything he deserves.<br/><br/>Right away, alarms will be raised by some  what happened to the sacrilege of maternal instinct? How can Juno be so heartless as not wanting to see the baby at all, ever? I do not pretend to understand the mind of a 16-year-old today, particular during such a predicament. But I find Juno's act in the movie quite natural and unpretentious. Perhaps at that stage of her life, maternal instinct is all but dormant. She simply did the most logical thing  after ensuring that the baby will have as much a chance to have a good life as she can secure, simply put the whole mistake behind her and get on with her own life. Of course she is concerned. The only time she is ever in tears is when she finds out that this couple is actually getting a divorce which means that she is putting her baby into a single-parent family. But when she becomes confident that the adopted mother is a good one, she again makes a logical decision  to go ahead with the original plan.<br/><br/>The movie is light, unpretentious (I must re-emphasis) and the kind that extracts from you not roars of laughter, but rather smiles and chuckles of appreciation. The cast, aside from Ellen Page who plays Juno, is marvelous  with layers that surprise, delight and trouble you as the movie progresses. Ellen Page is not marvelous. She is perfect."

She first considers abortion, but at the clinic she decides that's not for her, and instead she confesses to her parents and decides to give the baby up for adoption. She finds adoptive parents, Vanessa and Mark, with Bateman and Jennifer Garner putting in great performances. But Juno soon finds the adoption won't be as perfect as she initially imagined.<br/><br/>Juno is a comedy that relies on characterization and dialogue, and while some people won't get all the cultural references (I didn't), Juno is generally a charming character who was worth meeting. The movie also has a wonderful, artsy soundtrack. Juno generally has fewer flaws than Little Miss Sunshine, but a few jokes in Little Miss Sunshine were funnier than Juno.

","When I listen to critics commenting on how good the screenplay is, it is obvious that they were bribed. After watching this, I could not believe all the good reviews it got, especially for the screenplay. I do think Ellen Page is cute and displayed a fine performance. However, after I saw the hilarious 'Superbad' (which even had a better story), I started to like Michael Cera for his acting. In this film, he is basically portraying the same person as in the other film, so now I no longer am interested in his other movies.<br/><br/>Juno does feature some humour and I did laugh during some of the stuff Juno's father said, but otherwise, this is pure drama. It is not even 10% comedy. I mean, what is all the fuss if all the hanky-panky happened on a chair. The start of the movie makes it seem like this is more significant than Barak Obama becoming president. And of course, the love scene could happen anywhere else, like the couch or the bed or the table etc. Diablo Cody's script is one of the most overrated I have ever seen. Plot is okay, but the story is too predictable with some boring dialogue to deserve ANY award nomination, let alone a win. This makes Randall Wallace's Pearl harbour screenplay look Oscar-worthy. Little Miss sunshine may not have deserved its Oscar as much as Letters From iwo Jima, but it was definitely a great story unlike this.<br/><br/>The directing was good, but nothing genius. Despite Ellen's good performance, I found her character more annoying than listening to the overrated reviews for Juno. She is always unnecessarily sarcastic and dislikable. Her personality portrayed her as such an immature teenager that you'd think someone like her would rather have an abortion the first day she got pregnant than to adopt the baby. The film does not even have likable characters to make it better.<br/><br/>This film wasted a whole evening for me that I could have spent, watching something better and funnier. therefore, I strongly recommend you avoid this movie."

But yet the most annoying part of this film, was the soundtrack. That music was just plain awful, and come to think of it really complimented the movie in that way, trying to be too ironic and cutesy, trying to spark emotions that aren't even there... and was all too repetitious and bland.<br/><br/>A movie is not a deep film just because they say it is. In fact, whoever called this Indie needs to be shot. Just watching the opening credits one can tell that this was a major budget movie masquerading as something unique. In fact, it was all too cliché and felt like it was written by somebody in their 40s pretending like they knew what being pregnant and 16 was all about, yet missing the mark by about 5 years in either direction. But, as being such a big budget movie as it was, they did at least get good acting, especially on the part of Jason Bateman... and Ellen Page was good at least with what she had to work with.<br/><br/>So, in short, if you are past your prime, and a female, this might be a good movie to watch and you might even enjoy it. But do not, under any circumstances, associate it with the words deep, cute, indie, ironic, or realistic. It just isn't right."

","OK, first of all, my opinion is that any movie that enters, in this case, IMDb top 250 represents some sort of institution, a thing you can look up on, a piece of cinema art, etc. but then again, I see that I'm wrong, because a lot of people give straight 10s to any kind of a movie that come out...<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the ""Juno""... I just couldn't get along to it... I was waiting for some big/capital scene or sentence that would add some spice to the whole movie... unfortunately, there wasn't anything new or shocking to me... also, I tried to look through the eyes of 16 year old pregnant girl, or a teenager, to get some lesson or a fact from this film, but after it had finished, I felt the same way about everything... I might not be familiar with teenage pregnancy (or, to put it this way, i haven't make a mistake yet), but i saw it, and talk about it, a lot of time...<br/><br/>So, in the end, my recommendation to anybody that hasn't watched this movie is don't be to rushy to watch it... it's something that is not new, entertaining, or too funny, but if you have hour and a half to spare, go and see it... if you don't, your not missing anything...<br/><br/>5/10 just for the effort"
"kostasxrysogelos","6","4","11","27 February 2008"," Cute but nothing special
","Well, I must confess I'm rather shocked by the extremely highly rating given to this movie by the IMDb users. In my opinion, this movie is too overrated. It's only a teen-movie, for god's sake, filled with all the elements we're tired of seeing in any other teen-movie: The stupid dialogs (seriously, does any kid speak like that in real life?), the catatonic American-rock songs, the not-so-funny jokes etc.<br/><br/>Anyway, it sure is cute, light-hearted and positive. One thing I don't understand though, is how in the world did this movie won an Oscar? We may as well start considering if the Oscar-thing faces steadily its decadence.<br/><br/>A couple of elements of the movie I would like to comment, are the following: a) The structure of the movie, divided in the four seasons, is quite interesting; The girl changes her moods according to the change of seasons. b) The symbolization of the running students is also well given; the boy, who is an athlete, finds happiness when he stops 'running' (from his responsibilities, that is). c) The dialogs (as mentioned above) aren't very realistic; perhaps they hide some irony or they intend to make a parody out of the standard teen-movie. All these elements, that reveal a movie well worked, save the whole thing from being a failure. But they aren't sufficient to create a movie deserving a 8.2 rating either!"

","I was hesitant to watch this film after seeing the leading male actor and hearing it was a comedy. I figured it was another teen movie that would be entertaining but have no significant plot to it. However, after watching this film, I cant understand how it was described as comedy. The little humor that was in it was cynical and sarcastic; not at all like a teen movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it was not at all what I expected.<br/><br/>There were a very limited amount of actors and shooting locations, yet I never became bored or lost interest with the plot. This was a well written and well acted movie. I cant compare this film with any I have seen recently as it doesn't seem to fit into any genre. The plot was solid and interesting, there were plenty of humorous moments yet it always kept the overtone of the serious subject matter. Everything right down to the soundtrack was original and interesting; I strongly recommend it to anyone that is even remotely intrigued by the description. I am sure you will not be disappointed."

"mjjusa-1","8","4","11","31 December 2007"," We were silent at the end
","I just saw Juno on a cold and dreary day. Theater a third filled, but that third almost all young girls, high school, late middle school, a few early college maybe, no older women, no older men. The movie is about a high school girl who has sex with her dorky boy friend, seduced by a chair she says, and the act is told in flashback as she tries again and again, with the Greek chorus of a convenience store clerk and customer, to make a pregnancy test change from positive to negative through sheer will and repetitive testing.<br/><br/>It's one of those movies that touches your heart. With the actors speaking in a vernacular that rings true. Using language hidden from those beyond high school that is so descriptive and so natural that it makes TBHS (those beyond high school) think, for at least a second, beyond inherent cultural and age superiority, that true beings, as true as when they were in high school, actually walk the corridors and unlock lockers and have sex and become jealous and fall in love and make the same dumb mistakes that you made too. Juno the movie and Juno the person have true emotions, and show us real lives rather than the familiar dross of sit com exploitations, MTV reality shows, and adolescent sex comedies which appear with some regularity at our local multiplex.<br/><br/>I remember experiencing what mass media said about my generation's life in high school when I was in high school. It wasn't even wrong. It was embarrassing and contemptible. They had no ear, no empathy, nor sympathy for what we thought or felt or were. Stories complete with glossaries of terms and definitions to hip their readership to what was today's teen world. Meretricious, utter crap.<br/><br/>High school. Sex and love. Life. Situations requiring emotional understanding beyond one's age group, family, jutting up against adults trying to understand, wondering what is real and if love is real and if love can be forever...such is the stuff of Juno. You can argue, if in a cynical mood, that the language is too hip and too easy to the tongue of the characters, and that Dorothy Parker isn't a knocked up teenager in Minnesota in 2007, that Juno is as fictive as Jupiter's wife, but that would be missing the point of going to the movies.<br/><br/>All of these characters are given the opportunity to live on the screen. I watched and wondered, not knowing, how much of this movie was the product of the screenwriter's life and how much of her imagination? It does not really matter, of course, but even asking such a question gives an indication of how good a movie Juno is.<br/><br/>In most movies pregnancy and children are props or opportunities for one liners or just in the background. But, this movie isn't like that. In Juno, there are no big messages just the grand and glorious message that life is, that people live it the best they can, and that a good writer and a good director can use that big screen for small moments with big emotions and take the audience with them as Juno and her dad and step mom and best friend and boyfriend and surrogate couple get through nine months of her Junior year and summer.<br/><br/>The audience laughed and sighed during the movie and there was a moment of silence as the screen went black as if we all wished Juno would stay around a little longer. Ellen Page, is wonderful, as much of a cynic as Joseph Gordon-Levitt in 'Brick', but like him as in all cynics, a thin protective veneer hiding the open heart of a romantic just below. Like all of us."
"eliebellie","10","4","11","16 December 2007"," One of the greatest movies of the year
","I was so excited to see this movie when I saw the trailer for it. I drove an hour to see and was not let down one bit. The character of Juno is someone people want to relate to, someone who you want being your friend. She's quirky and original. Her family is intelligently funny, the whole theater was laughing so hard at some points that some times I couldn't hear the next line. Juno is so well written, it's not just some teen movie about being knocked up it's so much more than that. It really makes you think about family, relationships, and friendship. I'd recommend this movie to anyone. A review I read on here about this movie talked about how a ""30 something stripper wrote it, that's why it's getting so much attention"". Diablo Cody is so brilliant and her being a scrutinized about being an ex-stripper is just proves the point that most people can't see beyond the surface of things. You knowshallow people? Anyways, the movie was fantastic, the characters where uncharitably cool and the story was great. Go see it, you will fall in love with it."
"stevefz","10","4","11","13 December 2007"," I fell in love with a pregnant girl named Juno
","Right now, Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody have a perfect record when it comes to great film making team-ups. I want it to last, I want this film to succeed, and I don't want Juno 2: Should we keep it this time? The problem I face in writing anything about Juno is that this could very easily turn into an embellished recall of the plot, a bit where I gush on and on over my favorite lines and comedic timing. That would be great fun for me, but little interest to those who have not had the chance to see it yet. This film, this story, these characters, they all just work for me. When you hear the plot you first will think of Knocked Up, but that would be like comparing the lesser American Me to the greater Blood in Blood Out, or The Stoned Age to Dazed and Confused. I loosely use those examples to make my point as the driving point of Knocked Up and Juno is an unintentional pregnancy, but they explore the conflict of sperm vs. egg and the responsibility that comes with that chance completely differently from each other. I loved Knocked Up, but I adored Juno.<br/><br/>Ellen Page plays in her breakthrough role as Juno MacGuff, a self aware 16 year old girl whose sarcastic wit is saved from no one. Michael Cera as Paulie Bleeker does exactly what we have seen him do so far, a reserved kid with a quiet disposition. Cera is perfect in this, being the great introvert for Page to play off extrovertly, but he has to be careful not to fall into that role much longer. Get him in a Meth comedy, like Spun meets Half Baked. I want to see Cera show us a little more, just so he has some longevity past the Apatow machine that is at its peak right now (Someone get me to see Pineapple Express now!). He is used sparingly though, Bleaker is pretty much just a sperm donor; the real star is Juno and her growing tummy. In the film, we go through the seasons of change as Juno deals with the consequences of unprotected sex. The burden of coming clean with parents, dealing with a social Scarlet letter in High School, and hormonal flushes roll right off Juno's back as she decides how to deal with the baby growing within her. She answers an ad in the Penny Saver for a couple looking to adopt and finds what she believes is the perfect loving home in the upper class marriage of Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner). An arraignment is struck, and the papers are signed. The baby will be theirs.<br/><br/>There will be those that say such a plot is inconceivable in the modern world. These might be the same people that could not believe Seth Rogen would ever hook up with Katherine Hiegl. I have no qualms with that pairing, but maybe that's wishful thinking on my part, fair enough. I like the message of this film, the quiet notion of choices. I knew a couple like the Loring's once, wanting a child so bad, maybe under false pretenses. I won't soap box here, but while I am pro-choice on the abortion debate, I wouldn't mind seeing more local adoptions out there. Just a thought, from a 20 something single male with no wife, no girlfriend, and no kidsso take it for what it's worth.<br/><br/>I predict this film will do amazingly well on DVD as the buzz continues to grow past the theatrical release. There is a Napoleon Dynamite quality to the film. Page doesn't play a droll character like Heder did; there is this charming quality about the film, from the story to performances that just makes you fall for the whole thing. The music by Kimya Dawson and others pairs so well that if you like this film in the slightest bit you will be compelled to pick up the soundtrack as soon as possible. I certainly am adding some more female artists to my male centric playlist because of this film.<br/><br/>As stated, this film will move the discs when it finally hits shelves, but don't wait for that. Juno is a film that had me laughing a day after the credits finished. Small moments would pop in my head and a soft chuckle could be heard coming from my gut. Around Christmas time they will have 800 to 1000 theatrical releases(hell, call yours and tell them you want it), so look to the official site for the coming availability in your area. Juno got me, I hope she gets you."

"ClaytonDavis","9","4","11","8 December 2007"," Do you have a crush on Juno?
","When's the last time do you remember laughing at a teacher putting a condom on a banana? Or a teenager peeing on a home pregnancy test? Or quote ""Thundercats a go!?"" Diablo Cody writes her intimate character portrait Juno, starring Ellen Page in the title role as a young teenager who gets pregnant and decides to give it up to a family unable to have children.<br/><br/>Thank You for Smoking's director Jason Reitman helms this ship of laughter, tenderness and Hamburger phones. The narrative is absolutely fantastic as it keeps the viewer engaged at all times but in essence, it's the hypnotizing dialogue from the screenplay by Diablo Cody that makes the film work so well.<br/><br/>Ellen Page turns in one of the year's best performances as the young naïve and charming Juno MacGuff. She'll steal your heart with her wonderful one liners and equally break it with her character breakdowns and insecurities. Even though this has no measure to her Oscar snubbed performance in Hard Candy, this does hold some time of candle to it and is complete contention for an Oscar nomination. The role however, doesn't possess that extra mile to steamroll any other female performer this year. But its not only Page that makes the film succeed.<br/><br/>Some of the supporting players turn some of their best performances of their careers. Michael Cera popularly known as the innocent ""Evan"" from Superbad, plays Paulie Bleeker, the ""father-to-be-not"" and gives a charming comedic performance. His role however doesn't require much out of him with the exception of tiny yellow shorts.<br/><br/>Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner play Mark and Vanessa, the couple waiting for their chance at parenthood. This dynamic duo turn in the best performances of their careers. With layer upon layer of emotions these two actors possess, its amazing how they ever came to know them. Bateman's charisma and immaturity to say the least, fits well with the picture. His awkwardness is embodied quite well. Garner who tears at you from the inside out is so effective as Vanessa, the hopeful mother-to-be shows acting range which we have never seen from her before. Heartbroken, worried, and disenchanted engulf Vanessa which makes Garner sensational at her job.<br/><br/>J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney play the lovable parents of Juno. As she tries to come to terms with her new pregnant lifestyle she spends time with her stepmother Bren, (Janney) the sarcastic, hard-nosed woman that is coming to terms with her new stepdaughter. Janney is lovable and utterly hilarious but its Simmons who is the stronger of the two and is more authentic in his character and traits. There is a good breakthrough performance lying in Olivia Thirlby as the ""teacher obsessed"" best friend of Juno. She turns in a beautiful humane performance and encompasses the young teenager persona wonderfully.<br/><br/>What are Juno's Oscar chances? To quote Tom Houseman as he told me after the film was over ""That is not Little Miss Sunshine."" Completely true and well said, it is not Little Miss Sunshine but it is a great picture, very reminiscent of past teenage icon films Fast Time at Ridgemont High and Weird Science. Diablo Cody is a definite threat for the Original Screenplay Oscar and Ellen Page is a strong contender for Best Actress. (I feel it'll be between her and Amy Adams for a spot) Best Picture isn't out of the question but it's rather small in a year full of big films and bigger stars. The film is a gem but I think expectations were too high and it fell a little short. But alas, I love Juno.<br/><br/>Grade: ***½/****"
"uberlegitimate","10","4","11","8 December 2007"," Acerbic dialogue balanced with poignancy
","I don't think I've immediately loved a movie more than Juno.<br/><br/>This film was perfectly cast, perfectly paced, had the perfect amount of cynical language while still being balanced with enough poignancy and heart to make it believable and relatable.<br/><br/>It's so easy to say that Ellen Page is the stand-out star in Juno, being the eponymous role. I agree that her portrayal of the whip-smart, maturing 16 year old was excellent. However, the art of the film was really in the collaboration of all the actors. Everyone hit the right note. I would say that most surprising was Jennifer Garner's performance. This is not because I don't usually like her (I usually appreciate her presence in films), but she turned what could have been a caricature of a WASPy, barren career woman and made it genuinely heart-breaking. Her husband Jason Bateman portrayed the character of a sell-out would-be rock musician stuck in an unfulfilling, but lucrative job. J.K Simmons and Alison Janney were perfect as Juno's father and stepmother. They were caring without being cloying... but also sarcastic without seeming like they were making light of the situation. Michael Cera was great in his role, he seems to have nailed the role of the awkward, but sweet teenager; he knows what he's good at and sticks to it. The only really superfluous character was Juno's best friend Olivia Thirlby. I don't like how she was written, but she still provided much needed support to Juno.<br/><br/>Diablo Cody starts the film by trying to fit in as many quips and references as possible. This would usually be annoying, but since it was delivered so believably and naturally by the characters, it made sense. It is made even more bearable once we are drawn into the heart of the film. You really invest yourself in these characters and each of their individual positions. Jason Reitman did a nice job in his light-handed direction. He seemed to let the characters come to life by the actors' own abilities.<br/><br/>I went in to see the film with very high expectations and really, it went above and beyond all of them. If you can forgive the first 15 minutes of the film trying to find its pace, then I highly suggest this entertaining film. I want to make everyone see it."
"geevie","10","4","11","4 December 2007"," Delightful movie.
","This is a delightful movie. Ellen Page does a fantastic job. She has a great supporting cast but there is no doubt that she is the movie. The dialog is fast-paced and every piece of it is wonderfully executed. If you miss any of it, you'll just have to see the movie a second time.<br/><br/>Juno tells the story of a pregnant teen-ager and how she copes with the news. The story is told with empathy and humor. In many ways, it is reminiscent of The Waitress which dealt with a similar situation and was likewise carried by the star, Keri Russell. Like that movie, you leave the theater with an upbeat feeling. I can't think of a better way to spend an evening than watching a double feature consisting of Juno and The Waitress."

","Junoverse ID # 809 <br/><br/>Well, to begin with, i'm a somewhat obsessed fan of Ellen Page so going into this film i was already too excited to speak. I expected the film to be a wonderful movie but nothing too life changing. I went to a promotional screening in Atlanta last night and i have to say that i was overwhelmed with how much i liked it. Every time i think of the film i smile and want to watch it again, right now, but can't because it's not readily available to me. I have decided that JUNO is my most favorite film of all time. AND THAT IS SAYING A LOT!!!<br/><br/>The film begins with a chair.<br/><br/>Juno(Ellen Page) is standing in a random front yard drinking a gallon of SunnyD, staring at a chair and contemplating the situation she's in; that all started with a sexual encounter with her friend and band mate Paulie Bleeker(Michael Cera, Comedy GOD). She then ventures through a beautiful opening credit sequence to a convenience store to take her 3rd pregnancy test of the day. The plus sign once again appears and the shenanigans begin.<br/><br/>After deciding against an abortion she finds a rich couple looking to adopt a child. The Lorrings, Mark and Vanessa(Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) are the seemingly perfect recipients of Juno's unborn child. But the dysfunctions that are beneath the service may change Juno's mind about them.<br/><br/>The film is wonderful. Ellen Page gives the best performance of her career, so far. Diablo Cody, the writer of Juno, is going to be one of my favorites in years to come, i'm sure of it.The director of the film Jason Reitman(director of Thank You For Smoking) proves himself, at least in my mind, as one of the best directors out there.

"zkonedog","2","2","4","4 March 2017"," Napolean Dynamite/Knocked Up Hybrid That Fails To Be Either
","I watched ""Juno"" with a younger (teenaged) sibling hoping that it would provide a good mix of comedy and drama. While the film strives to do just that, it fails to truly define itself in any genre.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, the movie focuses on Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), a 16-year old girl who has sex with fellow student/friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera) and ends up pregnant. Because Juno does not want to terminate the pregnancy, she seeks out a potential adoptive family in Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) & Mark (Jason Bateman) Loring. Things seem to be going about as well as can be expected for such a tricky situation...at least until the end of the pregnancy approaches.<br/><br/>Here is the major problem I had with Juno (and hence the one-star rating): It's almost as if the filmmakers said ""lets combine 'Knocked Up' & 'Napolean Dynamite' into one movie"". A decent idea, but it fails pretty miserably here. It isn't nearly as funny as Napoleon Dynamite, and it doesn't come close to Knocked Up in heart. Simply put, the comedy isn't funny enough to sustain itself, while the drama isn't on par with other films of the same ilk.<br/><br/>Another issue? I think that Ellen Page's portrayal of Juno is either hit or miss...no middle ground. I thought her character was annoying and just plain stupid for most of the film, which made the ending (which I will not ruin here) seem almost farcical to me. To me, Juno was one of the most poorly written characters I've ever seen on screen. I didn't empathize with her a single time, which obviously needs to happen if one is to enjoy the experience. The teenager I watched it with? She could have booted up the film again right away, so go figure. Maybe being a teen is needed to ""get"" Juno's character.<br/><br/>Thus, to me, ""Juno"" was a film that didn't make any emotional connections with me in the slightest. Right away, I felt like it was almost blatantly ripping off Napolean Dynamite (which isn't a great film in its own right, but at least some of its humor is timeless), while at the same time trying to cover a very serious topic. Had they done one or the other, I think I would have liked the film a lot more. As it stands, I view it as a rather convoluted mess."
"shiksoccer35","8","2","4","17 December 2012"," Overall, clever and witty.

I own this movie and would recommend it to anyone I know. Of course, most people I know have seen this movie. It begins with a girl who finds herself pregnant and is ready to have an abortion until the role of adoptive parents come along.

"minimusdecimus","8","2","4","29 October 2011"," I hate teen movies. Loved this one
","The smart people are called so because they are different from the vast majority, the average (the same is true for the stupid but this really isn't what's about in this movie) – and Juno is one of the most interesting characters in a teen movie. Smart, sensitive, nice, compassionate, original and innovative, mature despite the age and still sooo silly sometimes... like BIG silly!... So true for the people at the age of changes...I love it when people say, for instance, one harsh thing, but they tell you a completely different story with their eyes, or smile. Self-irony never ceases to amuse me and it's usually the mark of the true modesty. I like the complex individuals, capable of a large array of contradictory feelings and thoughts, with subtle nuances and shades of grey. Average is boring. Juno tries so hard to like and do what the 'different' people like and do, to be like them, and so unconsciously she is at times very close to become just another sheep in the herd. But she's 'genuine original' and that's what saves her for entering that other herd (the 'different' ones), what makes her a real individual. She is deep, brilliant and wonderful beneath the quite common flat and sarcastic mask. Ellen Page really understands the character she plays. She expresses everything with such a light and masterful touch and pulls you into the character's interior world so naturally – nothing less than acting masterpiece. At the end of the movie I felt as if Juno was a real woman (maybe a bit underage) – moreover, my dream girl – and restored my hope for humanity:) One of the best teen characters. And this makes Juno one of the best teen movies I've ever seen. And so that you know - I watch 2-3 movies a day, carefully making a drastic selection (there are only 24 hours out there...) Unfortunately, the plot itself, the ideas, are not that great or deep, despite the (somewhat) originality, so I wouldn't quite rate it as a masterpiece. However, it's one of those awesome movies I'd love to watch again over time, even if just for the acting and the characters.It's a portrait, after all, and as with any good painting, I can't just hang it on a wall and forget about it."

For the sensible Juno it is time for the traditional experiment, asking her sheepish best friend Paulie Bleeker for support. And: pregnancy. Followed by visiting an abortion clinic. Followed by her decision to deliver (the parents are informed and Bren to her husband, 'You know, of course, it wasn't his idea.'). The sensible Juno is too young and unwilling to raise a baby. Followed to browse ads for adoptive parents in the Penny Saver. Juno never backs from her decision, even then when Mark knows for sure, what every man boy should do and not does, and speaks of his unreadiness for fatherhood and family. His decision confronts Juno with questions she never bothered of, supported by her sensible father, they daddy talk and she self thinks. The written note, Diabolo Cody wrote the note, Juno leave at their doorstep. This note, we read it near the end of the movie, inspired of what could happen 'beyond' the movie. We have the 'grand'-parents Brenda and Ben. Juno as Vanessa's friend and the growing baby boys 'big sister'. The mother Vanessa, Juno's model when her time has come to be the good-enough mother. We should not forget the tender moment what her father says after the delivery: Someday you'll be back here, honey. On your terms.' After Bleekers high school cross-country teams winning run, he races to Juno's room after her delivery. He decides not to see the baby. 'Neither did I' Juno says to herself, 'really, he didn't fell like ours. I think he was always hers.' The nurse to Vanessa: 'Would you like to meet your son, Vanessa grasping: 'I have a son. I'm gonna. Is this. Am I' and Brenda: 'Like a new mom. Scared ...' June, cycling to Bleeker: 'As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is totally boss. He's the cheese to macaroni. And I know people are supposed to fall in love before they reproduce. But I guess normalcy isn't really our style.' Belongs the future really to them as parents? Both are teens with everything it means. The movie closes, both sitting outside the house, sensible knowing what they are and what not. It is not theirs but the screen writers thoughts and words. Rocketed to Oscarfame with everything connected to it. But: down to earth attitude what her ex profession needed. She couldn't afford sky thinking. The note, decorated in a fancy frame above the baby bed will be there when the boy eventually asks if it was Juno who wrote the lines and what they mean: 'Vanessa, If you're still in I'm still in. Juno.'"

","I'd had little to no intention of ever watching this film, the idea of a teenage pregnancy set in middle America didn't appeal one little bit. Instead when I found myself watching Juno one quiet weekend afternoon I couldn't switch off.<br/><br/>The films premise is basic, a teenage girl gets pregnant, decides that she's too young to keep the baby and decides to offer the child up for adoption. Surprisingly though, it's the young and successful couple who wish to adopt the unborn baby who actually have the real problems and are more unhappy with life than the teenage Juno.<br/><br/>This quirky film skips along the 9 months of pregnancy but Ellen Page ties it all together fantastically. Her performance as a geeky young, bright, independent, feisty and confident teenager is absolutely mesmerising. And for me it was Juno's character that makes the film so enjoyable. I've seen other people comment that they don't like Juno's personality but personally I find her extraordinarily charismatic and adorable.<br/><br/>Juno warmed my heart and left me smiling to myself many times throughout. Brilliantly written and nicely stylised filming makes this film easy for me to recommend."
"tavm","8","2","4","19 June 2008"," Juno is a mostly enjoyable comedy about teen pregnancy and its aftermath
","I just saw this movie with my parents. My dad complained about the title character's lines saying they're more likely to come from an adult than from an actual teenager. My mom just seemed to like the wittiness of the whole movie. During much of the beginning, I was ready to agree how overrated and pretentious some of this movie was based on reading many of the comments I've scanned through here. But while not every pop-culture reference was funny and I half wondered how many viewers would get the comparisons of Dario Agento to Herschell Gordon Lewis (with a scene from one of his movies, to boot!), I was enthralled by the various relationships between the characters and actors and the way they mainly flowed under Jason Reitman's direction of Diablo Cody's Oscar-winning screenplay. While Ellen Page also deserved her Academy Award nom as Best Actress, the most compelling performances to me were the potential adoptive parents played by Jason Bateman and especially Jennifer Garner. As an ""Arrested Development"" fan, it's also a little strange seeing Bateman and his TV son Michael Cera here and yet since they're not related in this film, they don't have any scenes together. But that's not too much distraction to me. Add in J. K. Simmons as Juno's father and Allison Janney as her stepmother and this movie is nearly perfect. There's also an amusing turn by Rainn Wilson in the beginning. While perhaps not a great lesson on pregnancy and its choices, Juno does manage to consider there are such choices. All considered, this movie is mostly enjoyable enough that I may consider seeing it again sometime soon."

","Juno, as soon as I saw the words and pictures of the cartoon treatment at the beginning, I felt very right. Clear and clean music, warm and brilliant sunshine, rendering a cool youth.In fact, I don't know how to state such a thing.Such a thing, which is actually very heavy or can be described as terrible, is told in such a relaxed tone.
A 16-year-old child, walking through a big tub of orange juice to make the ingredients for three pregnent tests.Call women now with a cute hamburger-type phone, with bad phone contact and a shake.
Tell the boy, I think, I should nip it in the bud, because, according to my physiology class, once you get pregnant, you're more likely to have a baby.The boy said, ""Generally speaking, yes, just like mothers and teachers.""
The boy's classmate said, did you know Juno was pregnant? Like our mother and our teacher?Do you know it's yours? You are so good! I think you should grow a beard.
Why is everyone looking at me? Because your stomach is a sphere. Wow, you're learning geometry.
Again and again, I can't help laughing. It turns out that things can also be described as less horrible.
Some of the details are actually very touching.
The stepmother said, in any case, thank God for this gift.
The father said, I thought you were a girl who knew when enough was enough. Juno was silent for a moment, with a rare seriousness and helplessness in his eyes, and said, I don't know what kind of girl I am.
In fact, no one knows who is what. Just don't judge people.
In fact, she should not be defined as a bad child, should she?
At least she can bravely to bear, to bear the consequences of their actions, to bear the pain of pregnancy in October.She can't watch movies with her classmates, smash donuts, and endure all the strange looks, but she doesn't blame anyone.She even got angry when the boy asked another girl out, and then felt that she was wrong.
It takes courage to face and bear it. She did the best she could and took responsibility.
Maybe youth is like this. Parents always want their children not to wrestle. It's better not to fall, but if you fall . so what?Maybe there will be some pain, but at least it will not fall into disability, and it will not constitute an obstacle to continue on the road in the future. That'll do it.
Sunshine is still bright, youth is still brilliant."

","Juno is an absolutely phenomenal film, and a near-masterpiece. It's weird saying that about a film of this genre, but it all lies in the direction by Jason Reitman. He is extremely talented, like his father before him, and I am really looking forward to seeing what he will bring to Ghostbusters: Afterlife.<br/><br/>The performances in Juno are solid all across the board. The cast is stacked, with the likes of Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner, J.K. Simmons, and Alison Janney. They all play their roles extremely well, and the relationship between everyone is engaging to watch.<br/><br/>The main part that makes Juno a near-masterpiece is the script. It's one of the best that I have ever seen for a film in this genre, and I couldn't get enough. The film barely stretches over the 90 minute mark, but all of the characters are fleshed out and the troubles they go through are relatable and believable.<br/><br/>The soundtrack to Juno was incredible, and almost became a character in itself. There are also some very touching moments, and I have no shame in admitting that I felt emotion towards the characters by the ending.<br/><br/>I have very little complaints with this film. It doesn't exactly break any new ground, and a couple of elements are predictable, but this barely bothered me. I was completely wrapped up in the story, and I cannot wait to watch it again.<br/><br/>SCORE: 95%"

","""Juno"" stars Ellen Page as young adolescent Juno MacGuff who's very witty in character and very cool in her ways of life. She resides with her father Mac (J. K. Simmons) and her stepmother Bren (Allison Janney) and lives off a strict way in how she behaves and how she talks. She attends a school in Minnesota and has a laconic boyfriend named Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera) who one day had sex with her which resulted in her getting pregnant. Now she's in a tough situation in which she must decide where to go from here. At first, Juno contemplates on aborting the child, but it is her friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) who suggests getting Juno to find suitable parents who will adopt the child and to provide a loving home for him or her. The parents that Juno comes across are Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). At first glance it seems like the perfect choice, only to later discover, it's not all as simple as it comes.<br/><br/>What makes ""Juno"" stand out is that it succeeds in remaining fresh, original, sincere and characters we can all relate to with enough material and character development to get the audience into these individuals life. Under the direction from Jason Reitman who previously directed ""Thank You For Smoking"" has brought wit, humour, provocative scenes and a coming-of-age journey where a young teenage girl now has the toughest decision she's ever had. Even as absurd and surreal as this story can be at times, the social commentary about teen pregnancy is handled with caution and care by Ellen Page who was nominated for an Oscar for her performance.<br/><br/>Although the topic of teen pregnancy and the dominating performance by Page carries the film, the other cast and crew deserve some special attention as well. Diablo Cody in her screenwriting debut did an incredible job in providing real characters facing real situations and speaking out towards youth about the struggles in making the hardest decisions in your life and what results will come into effect. Juno is quite a cool character and yet she remains attached to an awkward kid like Paulie who seems to spend most of the movie sporting a gym uniform with colours maroon and yellow. And sure her choice in men are questionable, we can get past that just like her decision to give her child up for adoption from potential parents from a classified ad she skimmed through.<br/><br/>This story can be a bit predictable in the end, but at least what's refreshing is how the scenes pan out. The people in Juno's life have varying degrees in how she interacts which may not always be logical, but still provocative. The supporting cast also deliver great performances. Simmons is wonderful as the fair but firm father. Janney is excellent as the strongly opinionated stepmother. Bateman is convincing as Mark the man-child who writes commercial jingles, and Garner as his wife willing to the commitment in raising a child. And Cera is still charming as the awkward crush who has a level of kindness. With its steady flow of one-liners, the jokes are not designed for shock. But through this journey we experienced the joys, the laughter and the tears and the angst with a solid message that never goes preachy. Not all journey's end with rewarding results. I'm just glad, this one did."

I taught middle school kids for 43 years and had no trouble picking out some names who would match the people in this film. We tend to apply our own standards on the parents, thinking they should act a certain way. I thought that Ellen Page's Juno was quirky and spontaneous, and that she was also incredibly insecure.

Ellen Page is magnificent. She is badass, cool, relatable and nails the role.Her character was so fun to watch. Michael Cera was also great and quircky.
This film is quircky, risky and kind of touching and really easy-going at the same time.<br/><br/>The script is good, though not perfect. The dialogue is clever and funny. There are a lot of funny references and details too. It just that two characters in the film were really weird. I am talking for the dudes who want to adopt the child. Almost every scene with them felt kind of weird, creepy and overall did not feet the tone. It might was bad writing or even some inconsistencies in the acting, but these scenes were my least favourite partof the film.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is fine. It is ne of those soundtracks with a banch of unknown, slow, sweet song that fit the movie but feel all the same and I would have prefered if there was not a song in every single scene!<br/><br/>Anyways, this film is definately not perfect, but it has a lot of good things and its lesson about self-discovery, relationships and love is nice and sweet. It is a touching, funny, rational and funky little film that feels kin of it's own messed-up thing.

","I fail to see how the movie is disappointing, pretentious, or hypocritical. Juno CLEARLY states in the trailer that she's handling things beyond her maturity level. The production is self-aware. I've worked around teenagers for years and there's always that sarcastic, ironic, pretentious kid. It's rare, but it happens. Her dysfunctional family is no secret, we're supposed to accept Juno has a distorted perception of reality. Again, there's always a teen that acts out during turmoil. Parents see it all the time. Juno is just a movie after all, not meant to be taken seriously. It's as unrealistic as the action-packed assassin movies the critics praise. Don't let its mundane setting fool you; it's still just a movie."

","Ellen Page's smart, quirky coming-out party is equal parts sharp, witty, honest and real. At times it can fall into the trap of playing mouthpiece for the screenwriters, Aaron Sorkin style, but it's rescued by a grand tapestry of vivid, relatable supporting characters and a brilliant performance from Page in the title role. Somehow, she manages to come across as both wiser than her years and wonderfully naive, and her struggle to come to grips echoes the kind of profound identity crisis many of us experience during adolescence. Hell, I'd imagine that kind of uncertainty still resides in a deep, dark corner of most adults. JK Simmons is noteworthy as a wary, caring father - the kind of guy we all deserve in our corner - and Michael Cera is at his painfully-awkward best/worst as the shell-shocked teenage father-to-be. Still funny after all this time, with a great partner in its charmingly appropriate, folksy original soundtrack."

Having a baby needs to be in the right time. Juno wasn't the perfect kind of mother she knew she isn't the one for the job, she planned for it, created the best atmosphere for the baby and kept the promise for a lovely woman who's been trying really hard to be a mom and whose husband bailed on her, feeling insecure with the whole thing rushing between his eyes. What I liked about this one, it's total sarcasm build with wisdom and precision. It's somehow cute and enjoyable to watch. when I saw the trailer, I totally skipped it and now; after watching it, I never regret anything of this.

Pay attention to her actions before the clinic scene versus after. Also how the clinic scene is significant to the entire movie. The purpose or reasoning behind the director's inclusion of this particular scene in the film may be to spark viewers' thoughts on how the smallest things may affect someone in a big way. Things you may have thought were insignificant can trigger someone's true thoughts. Their inner feelings come up for air.

","I read the script before i see the film and i got so excited. I thought it was a strong script with potential. The jokes made me laugh and in my head this story looked alive and kicking. When i saw the film i was disappointed, because it was so flat and drenched from emotions and tensions. The actors were speaking more or less in the same tone from the beginning to the end. The jokes almost went unnoticed because of this. All the actors (apart from Juno's friend) looked like replicas of ""Daria"". Talking fast without emotion like describing a horse race. Actually describing a horse race shows more emotion that the acting on this film. I think it was the director's orders that made all the actors play in a uniform way and i think that it killed the story. It reminded me the Gilmore girls. Is it a trend for actors to play like that? 2000 words per second and no ups and downs in their voice? The script omitted some more realistic parts of the story but it could be forgiven since it's supposed to be a comedy. On the other hand it had many opportunities for climax and suspense that the director didn't take advantage of. Like when Juno tells her parents she's pregnant,when they meet the foster parents for the first time and Vanessa looks like a control freak or when Mark and Juno get busted by Vanessa. We could use a little suspense and some more emotion. My advice: You would have more fun just reading the script than watching the film."

","After seeing the trailer for ""Juno,"" I went in expecting it to be the best film of 2007. Anything else and I would have been disappointed. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>The entire cast is excellent. It is easily the best ensemble in any film this year. Ellen Page is in every scene and she is able to carry the film. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman give their best big screen performances ever.<br/><br/>The trailer makes the film seem like it is going to be a laugh a minute. The trailer actually uses some of the funniest lines from the film, but it is more than just a comedy. It is a touching film that leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling afterward.<br/><br/>If you are looking for an uplifting film to get away from all the drab, downbeat films coming out this holiday season, you should see ""Juno."""
"evanston_dad","9","5","16","17 December 2007"," I Fell Hard for ""Juno""
","""Juno"" is this year's ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" a tiny film with a gigantic heart.<br/><br/>Ellen Page plays Juno (NOT like the city in Alaska, as she makes very clear at one point), a sixteen year old who acts tougher and older than she really feels and who finds herself pregnant after one experimental romp in an easy chair with her best buddy, Paul Bleeker (the terrific Michael Sera). She decides to give the baby to a thirty-ish yuppie couple (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) living in a sprawling McMansion who haven't been able to have a child of their own. The rest is a sweet, very funny and refreshingly unpredictable comedy about what it means to grow up.<br/><br/>There are dilemmas in ""Juno,"" but they may not be the dilemmas you're expecting. Diablo Cody has written a sharp screenplay that's fair to all of her characters. It was so nice for once to see a young, married, successful couple portrayed as something other than yuppies from hell, and both Bateman and Garner do wonderful work with their characters. Page is a revelation; this is one of those films that's so self-consciously quirky and in love with its own style that it could have been disastrous if not played just so, but Page nails the main character beautifully. She allows us to see Juno's vulnerability, and that's essential to the film's success. The film, unlike so many others, acknowledges that teenagers aren't equipped to deal with adult problems, and that there's a lot they could learn if they were only receptive to it. I give the film great credit for portraying Juno's parents (J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney) as something other than buffoons or losers. And Simmons and Janney as actors have some of the film's best lines and moments.<br/><br/>Only someone with a heart of stone could leave this film without a lump the size of Alaska in his throat. And, can I just say bravo to the filmmakers for including a terrific opening credits sequence. Am I the only one who's saddened by the fact that movies don't seem to have opening credit sequences anymore? <br/><br/>Grade: A"

","When this movie came out people were amazed and everybody was talking about it. It was a low budget indie movie that surprised all the critics and made the writer, Diablo Cody, the darling of cinema. And it's because of this and her quirky writing that we got ""Jennifer's Body"". Thank you for that. It was so unnecessary.<br/><br/>Juno is the story of a quirky little 16 girl who's wise beyond her years but is still stupid enough to have unprotected sex with her boyfriend for the first time and get pregnant. The movie deals with her going through all the ways of dealing with this namely abortion, being a teenage mother and giving the child up for adoption.<br/><br/>Nothing against Ellen Page and most of the cast as I think they did the best they could with this script but I'm really no fan of Michael Cera. He's just so unlikable and yes I realize that's a personal thing.<br/><br/>Beyond that, it just feels like it's trying to be something it's not. It's like a kid dressing up in torn denim, gelling their hair into a mohawk and proclaiming themselves to be punk while listening to Katy Perry.<br/><br/>This movie never reached me and I was profoundly bored not to mention wondering why so many people found it to be groundbreaking."

","What we're dealing with here is a film with no great humour in it that sends out the wrong message.<br/><br/>I don't understand why this film won an Oscar. I found the script to be unrealistic and not funny at all.<br/><br/>Ellen Page plays an unrealistic character - a girl who becomes pregnant, and upon finding out, nicks a van and transports half her living room set to the front door of the baby's father, just so she can hold a fake pipe up to her mouth and be clever. This kind of behaviour would never happen.<br/><br/>The parents' reaction to the news is surprisingly docile and muted, considering the scenario, and this is completely unrealistic.<br/><br/>The film constantly makes a mockery of the situation in a non-humorous way, and offers no advice, help, or even lessons, apart from the fact that you can have sex, and if you get pregnant (because STDs don't exist in this movie's world) you can just give your baby away, and go on with your life.<br/><br/>Basically, if you're considering watching this film, don't believe any of the hype. It's less than average comedy-wise, unrealistic and offers no real bite or genuine insight into the situation of teenage pregnancy. But Ellen Page is hip, and the music is hip, and the writer is hip, and some of the art work is hip. Balls! Hyped up to the nth degree, and nowhere near as good as most people say."

It shouldn't have even been nominated! One thinks that if she 'looked' like a writer - instead of a cross between Marilyn Manson & Elvira, no-one would really care for her.

","This movie had its moments but for the most part I wasn't really wowed by it. The best part was the funny dialog by the main character, but it just didn't seem very realistic. If a 16 year old girl suddenly found herself pregnant, I'm pretty sure she'd be pretty upset about it instead of just being like, ""Oh well, I guess I'm pregnant now."" Perhaps this is Juno's personality, but I'd think she'd be more upset about it, like she was later in the movie. Her parents didn't seem to be terribly upset over this turn of events, either, which kind of gave the movie an unreal feel.<br/><br/>But it is passive entertainment, and I guess I'd probably need to see it again to have a better appreciation of it, but it's one of those movies that I don't care if I ever see again. One last thing, I really didn't care for the musical soundtrack, either. I'm sure this movie appeals to a younger audience, or at least younger than me."

Maybe it was my fault because I built it up a lot and then I got disappointed, but this is a just an average movie. I can't even say it is good comedy, I was so in shock that I think I laughed two times the whole movie. The story is predictable, and all the characters (except maybe Bleeker, and one or two more) are annoying (especially Juno) and really hard to believe in their existence. The movie would only get any better if someone had a shotgun and killed Juno after the first 10 minutes. I think you should see this movie, just to agree with me."
"alainenglish","7","4","12","26 February 2008"," Great plot and acting, over-rated dialogue
","An independent movie featuring a rising independent star in the talented Ellen Page, ""Juno"" is an interesting and original take on the popular teen movie genre. Aiming for humour and poignancy, rather than soap-opera style drama or gross-out laughs, ""Juno"" succeeds through a great story and some strong performances.<br/><br/>The film centres on tough-talking but sweet-natured Juno MacGuff (Page)as she deals with falling pregnant after a one-night stand with a shy schoolmate Bleeker (Micheal Cera). Not in a rush to become a mother at sixteen, Juno enlists the aid of two adults Vanessa (Jessica Garner) and Mark (Jason Bateman) who promise to parent the child once it is born. As time wears on and Juno comes to term, fate throws up a few unexpected surprises and Juno is forced to make some really hard decisions...<br/><br/>The acting in this film is top-notch, no question. The ever-reliable J.K Simmons (""Spider-Man"") is on fine form as Juno's wise old dad, Cera is gently believable as her boyfriend and Jason Bateman turns in a fine performance as Mark. As opposed to Juno, who is wise beyond her years, Mark is really a child who has yet to fully grow up and Bateman captures this superbly.<br/><br/>Ellen Page has won a round of awards and an Oscar nod for her turn as the eponymous Juno, yet although it is a good performance, it is not the actress's best. She was better in ""Hard Candy"", and I think she should have gotten an Oscar nod for that film instead. But this is not to degrade her work in ""Juno"" however as she is still sweet, smart and funny in her role.<br/><br/>Oscar winner Diablo Cody has gathered much praise ""Juno"", which is her first ever screenplay. Her much-vaunted dialogue was to me a little too clever, as nearly every character in the movie makes classical or pop culture references. There are so many of them that pretty soon they fail register with the humorous effect intended. Far better is her actual plot, as Cody offers through her story an original take on the teen movie. There are virtually no stereotypes in her script, and I was impressed by the last-minute twist at the end. If Cody can apply her excellent story-telling technique on show here to other ideas and other movies, she will hopefully have a great career ahead of her.<br/><br/>Probably the least serious and least pretentious of this year's top Oscar contenders, ""Juno"" is well worth your money and your time."

At first she thinks she'll have an abortion, however she changes her mind and decides to put the baby up for adoption. As time passes she tries to deal with her family, her friends and the perspective parents for her baby.<br/><br/>Smart, funny, touching film that is actually almost as good as some reviewers would have you believe. The excellent cast lead by Ellen Page as Juno is a perfect match for the material.(Page's Juno is one of the great women of the screen and possibly second to Nora Charles as the ideal woman for me) Everyone is pretty note perfect. (I could actually argue that this film as as close to perfect in construction as one is likely to get.) The film's dialog is filled with endlessly quotable one liners. I'm certain that this is going to be one of those movies that people end up memorizing for the great lines. My problems with the film relate to the ""wittiness"" of the script. The dialog at times is almost too perfect and too polished, as many people have pointed out no one speaks that smartly that frequently. Others have pointed out that this is only a movie and not really real. I find myself on the fence, enjoying the lines, but at the same time bothered by the perfection of it all. I know its a movie but for a film that weaves such a potent spell of reality, the too good to be true nature does put cracks in the bubble. The smart lines do calm in the second half and they are less noticeable on a second viewing where the film can truly be seen for what it is and not what it seems to be or has been held out to be. For me, seeing the film a second time made the one liners just part of the film, though there seeming endlessness did slightly diminish things.<br/><br/>Still despite it all, despite an improving on a second viewing I still don't LOVE the film. I like it a great deal. I don't know if its one of the best films of the year, but it is one of the friendliest.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10 (7 out of ten for IMDb purposes).

"dead47548","9","8","31","5 January 2008"," Massively overrated.
","Juno is a very cute film about witty little high-schooler Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) and her unplanned pregnancy after losing her virginity along with the awkward Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). While being very cute for the most part, having one of my favorite endings ever, some pretty good performances (and one phenomenal one) and some absolutely hilarious scenes the film managed to be a massive disappointment for me. The dialogue, while sometimes hilarious, was mostly painfully annoying and so ""look at me I'm tres hip"" that it almost made me choke on my vomit. Even the plot was horribly contrived at it's core. Obviously Juno is educated well beyond her years, but she doesn't have the intelligence to use a condom, be on birth control or even have Paulie pull out? Fu*king please. Almost as jaw-droppingly outrageous is the fact that she's completely set on getting an abortion until some little Asian classmate tells her that her baby has fingernails and when she gets into the clinic she notices that everybody has fingernails and decides to keep it. On what planet does that happen? It's certainly not Earth. Must be Diablo Cody Land, which is a place I'd never like to visit. I'd read that the film was relatable and realistic to lives of teens. Whoever says that clearly has no idea what the average teen life is, or is just dropping too much acid to have any clue what they're talking about.<br/><br/>It also happens to drag pretty badly from time to time and has an insanely unbelievable subplot of romantic tension between Juno and the planned-adoptive father of her future child (Jason Bateman). Grimace. Of course those are really the only gripes I have with the film, though they do happen to be semi-major ones. It was pretty funny from time to time, had an unbelievably wicked soundtrack and some of the dialogue was top-notch. The performances were also pretty good. Michael Cera and Jason Bateman were both well-above average. J.K. Simmons was quite good for the small time that he was on screen. A big letdown, however, was Jennifer Garner as the adoptive mother. She wasn't bad, per say, but the fact that people have been talking about her performance as award-worthy is completely absurd. Nothing remotely above average. The star of the film though, the cute little Ellen Page, was phenomenal. In what could have been a very one-note performance she added a massive amount of depth and absorption into her character. Just like last year in Hard Candy, she floored me with her flawless portrayal."
"ceeingred13","6","3","8","29 February 2012"," A mixed bag
","On a superficial level, I liked the film. It was an enjoyable little story with some character growth and unusual choices and some fairly well-established characters. The problem was that however firmly a character is established, I have trouble getting the movie if I don't like them. Juno is acerbic, quirky and mildly interesting, but I also found her largely unlikable. The voice overs all were enjoyable, but her actual dialog I found grating. It felt like having a conversation with that person who is only ever talking to try and land a joke. The only actor who seemed to be playing a character in the real world was Garner, who by my estimation was by far the most unsung cast member. That said, I found most of the supporting cast decent enough, all the acting well above average and as the Juno character did actually make some transitions in the course of the film, it is much better than it should be. I'd be interested to revisit it at some point."
"carcar-759-676336","5","3","8","21 January 2011"," Somewhat cute, but nauseatingly unrealistic.
","What I had a problem with: *The made up slang was grating at times. <br/><br/>*The awkward scene where her mother squawked at the ultrasound assistant. The dialogue was forced. <br/><br/>*We are supposed to believe that smart Juno had planned unprotected sex. Essentially the first time she has sex she gets pregnant.<br/><br/>*We are supposed to believe that smart Juno decides willy nilly that she's going to have an abortion without much thought and that she willy nilly decided NOT to have one because she found out at some point early on fetuses have fingernails. A little funny, though, it potentially gives a false impression of how the majority of women that go through this make their decision. <br/><br/>*There is only one innocent protester that speaks English as a second language protesting outside of an abortion clinic. Really? There are a lot of protesters that protest this and they aren't all so innocent. At this point of the movie I began to wonder if this movie was on the edge of a severely unrealistic bias based on a fantasy world. <br/><br/>*She finds an adoptive couple IMMEDIATELY through some ads and they are ""perfect"" for the baby. At least, one of them is. There is no realism in showing a luck scenario. <br/><br/>*People ""stare at her at school"" at the absolute worst and ""talk behind her back"". We don't see this. We don't see struggle. <br/><br/>*She even has an easy birth. At most there's an argument between her and the father and the ""issue"" is focused on the awkward adoptive father scenario. <br/><br/>Both sides of a scenario would be preferable instead of some obvious ""see, it's not that hard to have a baby"" propaganda. It would have been amazing to see both sides...the ridicule girls get when they choose to be pregnant as well as the ridicule they face if they choose to have an abortion. Alas, it is difficult to make light of this topic. Unfortunately, by making light of a scenario like this it gives an unrealistic example on pregnancy, especially ""teen"" pregnancy, where childbirth and child-birthing choices are much more difficult. <br/><br/>What I liked: The ending. That was absolutely cute. I also loved that the woman who received her baby was truly the one who deserved it. I love how strong she was. That definitely warmed me up inside. The ending was heartwarming. We saw SOME semblance hardship in her (Juno) giving up the baby, she cried and felt a little bad. However, again, some struggle would be nice. She recovered a bit too quickly."

","I find it unusual that this movie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, as it isn't really that original, Knocked Up and Junebug are just two variations on the same theme.<br/><br/>The plot follows Juno McGuff as a precocious teenager, who's actually a bit of a bitch, who spouts pithy dialogue throughout like it's a 91-minute episode of Dawson's Creek and gets impregnated by her geeky boyfriend (Michael Cera) simply because she was bored and didn't want to watch ""The Blair Witch Project"". Juno contemplates abortion, but upon discovering that babies have fingernails she decides to adopt to picket fence couple Jason Bateman & Jennifer Garner, but not all is perfect beneath the facade.<br/><br/>The main bone of contention I had with this movie is that I really didn't care about Juno. She is very unlikeable, especially the way she speaks to people with complete disrespect, particularly her parents (J. K. Simmons & Alison Janney). There's constant references throughout to cool music, cool movies and cool figures of pop culture, but this doesn't make Juno a cool movie. Although there's good acting from the ensemble cast, the male characters are written one-dimensionally, especially Jason Bateman whose husband to Jennifer Garner is a pathetic incarnation of a man forced to keep his dreams and ambitions in a locked box with his balls. The movie also fails to tie up it's loose ends as you'd like it too and the soundtrack is spattered constantly with twee Belle & Sebastian-esquire crap.<br/><br/>Teenage girls will probably adore this movie, but this reviewer found it to be tawdry overrated (Mc)guff. It's also decidedly irresponsible as there is no ordeal, it's just a minor inconvenience of Juno's life which she manages to brush aside before the closing credits and she can get back to playing guitar with Michael Cera. Twee Twee Twee.<br/><br/>Watch Knocked Up instead, it captures the emotions of pregnancy a hell of a lot better without constantly reminding us how cool it is with it's ""in touch with the kids"" dialogue."
"ajh193","2","3","8","21 December 2009"," Unrealistic
","I cannot take this movie seriously. Aside from the pathetic attempt at acting and the completely hackneyed, pitiful dialog, the movie did not portray any realistic message. Let's go over the scenario: Your 16 year old daughter gets pregnant while hanging out with one of the neighborhood kids whom you have trusted since he was little. What is the parents' response? ""Wow, he's the father?! Didn't know the kid had it in him!"" Really? What caring parent would react like that? Let's also take into consideration their response when Juno says ""I'm pregnant."" ""You're pregnant? Well, gee I was hoping you had gotten expelled or you were involved in drugs or something...but pregnant? Never saw it coming."" The movie was by all means so unbelievably stupid it's not even amusing. Let's look at the other facets of the film that made it almost impossible to believe. I'm guessing that we're supposed to believe that a 16 year old girl would be willing to put up her baby for adoption, fall in love with the adoption father, fall out of love with him, and hand over the baby to his wife as if nothing happened. Not to mention that she's 16 years old and she drives a car all over the place. Overall, this movie was nauseating. It was not remotely funny, the ""original"" music was obscenely irritating, and Cody's attempts at witty dialog was pathetic. For anyone who likes the cheesy, phony sentimentality of Hollywood endings, you'll like this movie. For anyone who actually appreciates a realistic film, spare yourself the desire to commit homicide and don't see this movie."

This doesn't really go well with the middle-class angst-ridden teen that she is suppose to portray in the film. I get that she is much smarter and wiser than her years (really the whole schtick of the movie). But it is a bit hard to buy.<br/><br/>And what's with the ""geeky is cool"" boyfriend? Are we supposed to accept that he would wear velcro headbands and short shorts (ala 1970) in 2007?

","Juno is best described as a dramedy where the plot is driven by character development rather than external events. It is fascinating to watch the very gifted Ellen Page as she goes from a very bright but rather typical sixteen year old smart ass to someone who matures into a young adult as she deals with an unwanted pregnancy. The way she can convey a teenage ""could care less"" sarcasm and then a barely concealed scared vulnerability within the space of one sentence merely by a subtle change of expression, the tone of her voice or the flicker of an eye is worth the price of admission alone. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent and while the dialog is somewhat quirky at times, it only adds to the enjoyment of a movie which constantly surprises your expectations. The best movie of 2007 in so many ways that it's not surprising that this indie film, which cost only about 7 million to make eventually grossed about 150 million at the box office.

Paulie Bleeker, Micheal Cera, (Super bad) plays<br/><br/>a timid young boy who is in love with Juno MacGuff.<br/><br/>Juno tell her dad, J.K Simmons and her step mother<br/><br/>, Allison Janney, about her plan to put the baby up for adoption. A young couple , Mark , Jason Bateman , and Vanessa Loring, Jennifer Garner. Juno finds the young couple in a penny saver add, when she finds out that Mark is going to divorce Vanessa, Juno decides that the baby boy should still go to the young woman who desperately wants a baby.<br/><br/>Juno is the must see movie for teen girls. I would give it a<br/><br/>5 out of 5 for its careful direction by Jason Reitman, and super writing by Diablo Cody. The direction in this movie was taking to very wonderful levels and made sure that every piece of the story line fits together. This movie has very little special effects but is fine without them. Released in Canada in December 25 2007. <br/><br/>Juno is a Romantic, funny, chick flick is perfect for a night in with your girl. It has everything that you could ask for, even insertion. For young teenage girls this movie may become a favorite to many. This tale of a young pregnancy shows girls that there is still hope when everything is falling apart. I fully recommend Juno for a 10 out of 10."

","I have seen this movie close to 30 times and almost watching this daily. This film is really that good. One of the best films I have ever seen. Ellen Page gives a performance of nothing short of perfect and I really thought she was going to win the Oscar. Micheal Cera gives one of the most underrated performances of all time. He certainly deserve many awards but was definitely shadowed by Javier Barden in ""No Country for Old Men"" also a great supporting performance. Jason Reitman was what got me into this movie since really like ""Thank You for Smocking"" and this well be the movie that well but him on the A list. Diablo Cody who this is her first screenplay defiantly has a career fer her in the future. Almost every character in this film is very likable especially Juno and Paluie. This was certainly one of the best films of the last year and certainly to be one of the best for years to come."

","Well I never did see this because the new thing seems to be the huge promotion on the little independents. I thought ""Little Miss Sunshine"" was promoted fantastically for a very mediocre film. I held out longer than anyone because I was sure this was another of the so-called independents that wasn't worth it. However the script is very much like ""South Park"" with a lot of it's irreverent although oftentimes both true and sound like I still talk. (Yes I will be saying Dude probably till the day I die) I related to all of the characters, and thought that they were very similar to the way I felt and many of my friends did as well while in High School. I will never doubt Jason Reitman again, although Diablo Cody's script is great, I'm still not convinced w/her. Reitman however did the absolutely excellent (yet very little seen) ""Thank You for Smoking"" which everyone should see. That is just my two cents, and please take it from a guy who has seen more movies in his lifetime than everyone I've ever known combined. OK that sounded braggy, but I watch a minimum of 2 a night."
"javaman-7","10","3","8","25 April 2008"," Feel-good movie of the year for Film Appreciation teacher
","Java Man Reviews ""Juno"" (Rated PG-13). Directed by Jason Reitman. Written by Diablo Cody. Starring Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney, J. K. Simmons & Olivia Thirlby. Running Time: 92 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>Juno MacGuff (Page) is a 16-year-old girl who decides it's time to have her first sexual experience. In an inelegant seduction scene, she persuades her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Cera) to participate in her adventurous experiment. Of course she gets pregnant. After a touching trip to an abortion clinic, she decides to put the baby up for adoption. Her girlfriend Leah (Thirlby) suggests looking at the ads for potential parents in the Penny Saver... ""They have 'Desperately Seeking Spawn,' right next to the pet ads."" When Juno breaks the news to her mom and dad (Janney and Simmons) their reaction is both priceless and hilarious. Her dad accompanies her to meet the upscale prospective parents, Vanessa and Mark Loring (Garner and Bateman). Vanessa seems overly obsessed with becoming a mom, while Mark is a jingle-writer who always wanted to be a rock star. Juno and Mark have similar tastes in music and hit it off -- almost too well. The film follows Juno for the full nine months as we get glimpses of the deeper feelings beneath the teenager's wisecracking exterior. What will she eventually do? The film has too many surprises to make that an easy guess.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 4 out of 4 Java Mugs<br/><br/>When Jon Stewart hosted the Oscar telecast earlier this year, he commented on the dark themes that characterized the other four Best Picture nominees: war, betrayal, murder and greed. Then he said... ""Thank God for teen pregnancy."" Though this film doesn't quite qualify as ""feel-good movie of the year,"" a picture this well-made makes a film appreciation teacher feel pretty good about the state of cinema.<br/><br/>First of all, the screenplay is smart, and so are the characters. Though a serious subject, there is plenty of humor, which comes from witty dialogue and inspired plotting and not from people taking pratfalls. Director Reitman has also done an exceptional job of casting the film with such old pros as Janney and Simmons who play Juno's parents to perfection, and newcomers Cera and Thirlby as Juno's perceptive pals. Garner brings unexpected depth to a character we originally perceive as hopelessly shallow.<br/><br/>While all the parts are well-acted and well-written (by Oscar winner Cody), the movie belongs to Ellen Page. With dazzling brilliance, she portrays a very bright girl who makes a mistake, lives with it, and attempts to solve her problems in unique and imaginative ways. A star in the making? The 21-year old Nova Scotian has actually been around for a few years, burning up screens in Canadian theaters and on north-of-the-border television.<br/><br/>My Oscar class debated whether or not this movie has a political axe to grind. Pro choice or pro life? We couldn't agree. We did agree on one thing... Juno is one of the year's best."
"jonnyk12","9","3","8","27 February 2008"," Guarteed to smile
","Deservingly, this film has been nominated for four Oscars including best picture (maybe) and best leading actress (hopefully) for Ellen Page, and it also has confirmed her status as one of America's best new talents. She is one to watch.<br/><br/>First of all it was nice to see a proper title sequence and not just a crappy title in the corner, but that has nothing to do with the greatness of this film. The basic story is about a sarcastic, cynical, tomboyish teen played by Ellen Page called Juno MacGuff, who has sex with her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera of Superbad). This gives her an unwanted gift, in a form of a baby. Woops.<br/><br/>Juno decides to give her baby to what seems to be a perfect couple of Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). It seems to be going smoothly at first but there bumps on the way to the birth.<br/><br/>Juno has a strange affect on you when you leave the cinema; the first reason is the fact that you couldn't ask for a better written story that makes you smile so much thanks to Diablo Cody, and secondly you feel that you could walk out of the cinema and you could see Juno MacGuff just standing there, as if she were a regular living, breathing teenager. That's how good Page is. In fact every single performance in this film is brilliant. It was good the way that Allison Jenney character of Juno's step mum, Bren isn't like average whiny she-demon like most step mums portrayed in films, she's far friendlier than you would expect. J.K. Simmons finally gets a role where he isn't a total jerk; instead, he's a sensitive father who truly cares for his wacky daughter. Some of the characters of this film may start off a little un-likable but nearly all turn out extremely likable.<br/><br/>Another fact of this film that I normally take no notice of is the sound track which is just perfect, as I like songs with good words; I might actually go out and buy it.<br/><br/>I don't think I have ever smiled (not laughed) at a film ever, only Little Miss Sunshine comes close. This film is also very funny with loads of witty lines shooting out of Pages mouth all the time. This really is a wonderful film."
"DukeEman","8","3","8","24 February 2008"," Perfect characterizations.
","At the end of the film I noticed that I was not feeling any emotional burden of anger or outrage that is normally associated with movies full of nasty characters giving our heroes a hard time. There was just a feeling of humbleness and tranquility. I wondered why and then realized that there was not one nasty character in the whole movie, (yes, the ultrasound technician came across with a streak of nastiness only because of her ignorance). I mean, ever character had flaws, like all of us who just stumble through life in hope of getting to the other end of it all, where ever it is! The success of this movie came down to the brilliant written characters and their portrayal by a superb cast. The writer respected each and every character and gave them a life of their own. This could not have been achieved by the perfect choice of casting."

","I needed a light-hearted movie to see so I picked this one. The music soundtrack was great! Also, I thought the movie did a good job in showing another side of a 16-yr. old girl getting pregnant...that it really is a lot to handle emotionally, even if you're physically ready to have a baby. As a 16 yr. old, you are inexperienced in knowing who you are and what people insinuate from your actions. Ellen Page was fresh and I enjoyed watching her on screen. The script was hilarious! Diablo Cody was great in thinking up of a story that has been told a thousand times (young girl getting pregnant, too young to raise baby), but she twisted the story from a humorous viewpoint that was very enjoyable and different to watch on screen!"
"dfranzen70","9","3","8","10 February 2008"," Juno? I think you do.
","Juno is instantly charming, witty, and just plain a lot of fun to watch. You wouldn't think a movie about teen pregnancy would be much of a hoot, as the topic generally lends itself best to movie-of-the-week weepers and movies with a moral message. Juno has no message, really, other than perhaps ""It's okay to be different"" and ""Love is sometimes found right under your nose."" It's not steeped in raunchy behavior; instead, it's sweetly charming, almost daring you to find fault with it.<br/><br/>Juno (Ellen Page) is a self-assured sixteen-year-old junior in high school, and she's just learned - after taking three home pregnancy tests - that she's in the family way. Juno is your slightly atypical caustic, sarcastic teen who takes issue with everything that society offers. To her, being popular is tantamount to being covered in hives. She's into old-school punk rock, not old-school grunge or boy-band music. She's a rebel without a cause, coping with her individuality by virtue of her quick wit and quicker tongue.<br/><br/>Juno knows who the father is - it's wiry Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera of Superbad). The question of whether Paulie and Juno love each other doesn't even come up; even they know enough to know that their relationship isn't at that level.<br/><br/>After some soul searching, Juno decides she wants to have the baby and then give it up for adoption. She and her best friend Leah find an ad in the Pennysaver, which leads Juno to the house of Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), a thirtyish couple that desperately wants to have a baby.<br/><br/>But again, this is no movie of the week. There's no teary confrontation between mother-to-be and mother-wannabe; there's no tone of Great Importance about how adoption would be Right for the unborn child. The situation is what it is, and it's played for tender laughs. Juno herself says that all she wants to do is pop the baby out and hand it over - but we adults in the audience know there's always a chance that when she does give birth, she'll experience remorse and reneg on the deal. We know it might happen, because we've all seen the similar true-life stories.<br/><br/>Juno, though, immediately takes a liking to the couple, so she plows wholeheartedly forward with the deal: she gives birth, and they get the child. Easy peasy.<br/><br/>Supporting Juno in her decisions are her taciturn dad (J. K. Simmons) and stepmom Bren (Allison Janney), both of whom alternate between offering advice and acting exasperated at Juno's latest exploits (in a memorable early scene, Juno recreates the room where the conception took place - outside Paulie's front door). For those of you who know Simmons through his role as Spider-Man's nemesis J. Jonah Jameson, you might be surprised at how tender and loving - although still gruff - Simmons can be. He's a lot like Harry Dean Stanton in Pretty in Pink; he obviously cares very much for his daughter and wants badly to help her, but he's out of his depth as far as pregnancies go.<br/><br/>And at the center of everything is the truly remarkable Ellen Page, a twenty-year-old petite Canadian who wins the audience over with her first appearance. As Juno, Ellen is unique, a girl dancing to the beat of her own different drummer, eschewing the rigid mores of society for a more enlightened, free-spirited outlook on life. Juno is not a delightful, happy-go-lucky girl; she's cynical, arch, and distrustful of popularity. But she's also sweet, honest, and loving, and not just any actress could be shoved into this movie like some cookie-cutter cutie from Central Casting. That's why Page's outstanding performance is such a treasure; she brings out the good and bad in Juno (which, ironically, is one of the ""messages"" the movie has for us).<br/><br/>Juno is not a low-brow comedy about impending birth. It does not involve a wacky obstetrician, and there are no panicking grandmothers-to-be. The difficulties that Juno faces along her journey to the delivery room are firmly rooted in reality, and they're difficulties that Juno faces with aplomb. There's hardly an insincere note in this delightful gem."
"merits30279","10","3","8","3 February 2008"," Great movie
","First, this movie is a great work of cinema, not a political statement. It doesn't make sense to argue whether it's pro-life or pro-choice, whether high school kids do talk like that, whether it's realistic to expect parents to accept their kid's pregnancy so wholeheartedly, etc. In the end, the movie is neither pro this or that, or against. It's just life; smart kids do stupid things, hormones' call at the certain day of month pushes the girl to get intimate with her best male friend; the result we know. Yes, there are kids who talk like that; and not all kids talk like that. The screenwriter didn't invented those characters, pretty much like Anton Chekhov didn't invent characters for his dramas. Just sit back and enjoy the story. Don't judge the characters; and after the movie ask yourself, what would you do. If you are a parent, would you help your daughter in such ""garbage pile of a situation""? If you are a high school boy, and got you GF pregnant, what would YOU do?"
"texrangers31","9","3","8","5 January 2008"," This movie is numero JUNO
","As far as independent films go, this is one of the best I've seen. One of the greatest things about this movie is how closely it depicts reality. All of the characters are just so real. Juno herself has such a likable personality and the audience falls in love with her almost instantly. Michael Cera's character doesn't have enough screen time as I anticipated but his role suits him perfectly. I wouldn't classify this movie as a comedy, but it is the type of movie that will make you smile at parts, and you will leave with a smile on your face. I saw 5 movies over my Christmas break, and I would say that Juno is the best movie that I saw. I would have to say that JUNO is the surprise of the year!"
"csandvig","10","3","8","4 January 2008"," don't let the snarky comments put you off
","This is a great film -- the few negative IMDb comments were a surprise. I think the positive buzz seems to have combined with its sarcastic dialog and indie-like offbeat tone to really agitate some of the hipsters posting here. ""It looks like an indie but it isn't independent enough!"" ""All of the wit is so scathing that it doesn't sound real!"" ""If everyone likes something it must be bad!"" ""We are independent film hipsters and we are threatened!"" However I went to the film without hearing anything about it first, and luckily it didn't occur to me to think too hard about its studio status. So I loved it. The real gem is that at first it feels like a plastic sort of movie, but it tricks you. It ""outgrows its own mannerisms"" as A. O. Scott wrote in the NYT review. That's a nice turn of phrase. All of the characters develop a surprising depth.<br/><br/>For the criticisms: When I want to watch a good film, why would I care how independent it is? When has realism in dialog ever been the crucible in which we test a film? Why would I object to a film that references pop culture A LOT? It is true that some parts were not cast with brilliant character actors -- there is not much of a detectable difference between Ellen Page and Michael Cera when they are in interviews (or in Superbad) vs. ""acting"" in this film. But other parts ARE filled with excellent character actors (like Allison Janney) and the whole ensemble works brilliantly.<br/><br/>It's funny, clever, touching, complex, and the best film of 2007."
"elyseiverson","10","3","8","3 January 2008"," One of the best teen movies I've ever seen
","My husband and I went to see this film on New Years Day, and the packed theater should have told me that I was in for a treat.<br/><br/>Ellen Page deserves the award-season buzz for her performance as Juno McGuff, a 16 year old who finds herself unexpectedly pregnant. Her performance feels very real, and shows an empathy for Juno that makes her lovable even for her sarcasm and ""differentness"". The movie is as good as it is because Ellen is Juno, and is showing us her life.<br/><br/>That's not to say the supporting cast isn't fabulous as well, because they are. Especially noteworthy is Rainn Wilson as the snarky drug store employee seen in the first few minutes of the film. He, by far, had the theater laughing harder for longer than any other single character throughout.<br/><br/>The movie definitely takes a pro-life stance (Juno is seen entering, and then leaving an abortion clinic), but it isn't preachy or condescending in its message. I've read some comments about it saying that the movie isn't believable. My opinion is that one would be hard-pressed to find a MORE real depiction of such a personal and emotional situation."
"wufoo03","10","3","8","15 December 2007"," Simply amazing
","I have to say this is one of the best feeling and funniest movies that I have seen in my whole life. It's truly amazing how a movie can make you laugh throughout and also give you a case of the happy cry. I can only say that you need to see this movie. My best description would be if you combined Little Miss Sunshine and Superbad together and they formed a movie that was even better than you thought either of them could be combined (I thoroughly enjoyed both movies- but not nearly as much as Juno).<br/><br/>I should also tell you that I had very high expectations for this movie, and it lived up, and surpassed in many ways every single one of them. I can only hope that you enjoy this movie as much as I did."
"doug1717","1","5","17","25 June 2008"," Ellen Page took a page from ""Trailer Park Boys""
","Don't get me wrong, I hated the film. But Ellen Page was good. She took her entire performance and attitude from Mike Clattenberg's ""The Trailer Park Boys"", a Showcase series from Nova Scotia Canada. On this show, she was just a kid who played ""Trina"", the daughter of Jim Leahy. She slowly begins to adopt the ways, mannerisms and language of Ricky, a reprobate semi literate drug dealer and marijuana grower. She copied and played Ricki as Juno in the film. Other than that, the film sucked. It was dull and slow paced. The film had some nice moments when they let the viewer discover what was happening by providing mere snippets of what was really going on. Clever, but not enough to sustain the film. Juno's lover was played weakly by the same semi retarded kid from ""Superbad"". Just a dull film about a smart ass kid who got knocked up because she was bored and wanted ""just to see"". Pure crap."
"KUAlum26","8","5","17","15 January 2008"," A good movie with super performances
","I went into this film feeling like I would almost HAVE to like this,since the buzz was nothing but good(save the scads of less-than-flattering posts on the JUno IMDb message board). I came away from the film genuinely impressed with the make-up of the film,even if the overall end product maybe left some things to be desired.<br/><br/>Whether you regard Minnesota teen Juno Maguff(Ellen Page,fast-walking and fast-talking through this gem role)as a typical teen might say as much about how you define the term ""typical"": a sardonic,artsy,semi-lonerish girl who is never shy to share her opinions about anything,her fateful encounter with the boy she loves(Michael Cera,who was probably better in ""Superbad"" and TV's ""Arrested Development"")gets her pregnant and,after initially wanting nothing to do with the pregnancy,decides almost impulsively to keep the baby,at least until she can find adoptive parents. Her search isn't particularly long as she stumbles upon an ad in the penny-saver for an attractive couple(JAson BAteman and Jennifer GArner,probably following each other from the set of ""The KIngdom"" to do this)who seem to be more than willing to adopt.<br/><br/>FAntastic performances by PAge,BAteman,GArner and J.K.Simmons(one of the more taken for granted actors in the biz)as Juno's equally sardonic but loving DAd are complimented by adequate,fine performances--if perhaps not exceptional--from Allison Janney(As JUno's step-mom),Olivia Thrilby(as her best friend)and Cera. Director Jason Reitman throws the curve by helming this(his previous flick was the scathing,sharp,slick ""Thank You For Smoking"")project,off a script by exotic dancer Diablo Cody. Both Reitman and Cody make a humane and funny(if perhaps over-written and too ""quirky"" by half)film,and the performances make the difference.<br/><br/>While I cannot,truly gush over this movie as many have(among other reasons:the super-quick,quirky,too-cool-for-school dialog and the sometimes annoying music scoring by Indy band Moldy Peaches),I am still impressed enough by the pacing,humor and general intelligence of the story to recommend it. Not the best movie of '07 maybe,but you could do much worse with your money."
"seishino","10","4","13","24 December 2007"," Most intelligent dramady in a long time
","I'm tempted to call Juno a comedy, but that isn't really correct. It's a dramatically gripping film, with real characters, that happens to be quite frequently funny. The humor generally comes through acid-sharp dialog, which is both sublimely human and thoroughly well written. The drama, however, comes out through characters which are neither black nor white. One moment a character will be portrayed engaging in a creepy and negative act, the next they will be viewed in a sympathetic light. Everyone is behaving with the best of intentions, and we as the audience get to ride along as those intentions twist the characters into an ugly reflection of us all. The excellent acting across the board helps this tremendously.<br/><br/>It's a quite sympathetic movie overall, and nobody comes off looking like ""a bad guy."" It's a solidly written, acted, and directed piece, that all comes together to feel grander than a simple family story. This may very well be the best coming-of-age film for years to come."
"editor-436","10","4","13","20 November 2007"," Teen Pregnancy Comes With Belly-Aching Laughs
","""It all started with a chair,"" is how Juno begins, like a Tom Robbins novel giving inanimate characters equal time amongst the human actors. It is with this simple line that the anthropologist of strippers turned blogger/journalist Diablo Cody launches the perfect screenplay, full of wit, empathy, heart and comedy.<br/><br/>Not often enough, in a film of any genre, are movie-goers given such a treat as we are with Juno. The story unfolds itself with a rare continuity making the story as believable as it is funny. Every loose string is tied up neatly and a simple story takes on heartfelt, humorous complexity. The film's subject manner isn't that of the gut-busting comedy it becomes. Juno is the story and name of a sixteen-year-old girl (Ellen Page) who out of boredom seduces her awkward best friend, Bleeker. (Michael Cera of Arrested Development and Superbad) When pregnancy follows, she decides to carry the child to term, but offer it for adoption to a young couple of baby-craving suburbanites. (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) The performances are as spot-on as the writing, perhaps a nod to what a cast can do with such punchy dialog and a story with so much heart. Page stands out not only as the film's star, but as one who will surely rise in the business. Cera's sweetly dorky portrayal of Bleeker is subtle and effective. Garner for once proves that she has the acting chops of her celebrity status, and actually provides a much needed balance to more than one character. Bateman too seems more three dimensional than in past roles. As Juno's parents, J.K. Simmons and Alison Janney display a needed adult perspective piece to the story, while demonstrating ideal parenting skills. Director Jason Reitman (Thank You For Smoking) has hit a grand slam on his second trip to the plate. The ebb and flow of the film and visual portrayal of this story fit perfectly and without question. It's also nice to see a film where the indie-rock soundtrack actually compliments the story, aiding the development, and offering musical hook along the way. Though none of this properly sums up Juno, a film that will inevitably draw comparisons to Knocked Up and Waitress, yet out performs both on story, dialog and acting. --And for movie-goers who don't thrive on good story-telling, few movies short of The Princess Bride and The Big Lebowski are as quotable as Juno. While Juno doesn't officially arrive in theaters until January, advance screenings are occurring all over the country, with a special website promotion where fans can win a private screening as well as custom Gibson guitar. Not only do they offer a ground-breaking, highly creative film, but the marketing campaign seems to be at par with the product itself. Veering from witty to raunchy to heartfelt and wholesome, Juno accomplishes the impossible and works as all of these things at once. All screenwriters could learn a thing or two from Diablo Cody, and all movie goers will likely enjoy Juno, wanting to see it over and over again."

"Electrified_Voltage","4","3","9","27 April 2010"," A highly praised film about teen pregnancy, but I'm afraid I can't join the majority on this one!
","This movie was definitely a success when it was released, with its critical reception and box office results. Over two years passed before I got around to watching it, but I remember knowing about the film very shortly after its release and hearing the soundtrack, which I didn't like. I wasn't too interested in seeing the film for quite a while, and the main reason why I finally watched it after all this time was probably because the lead role is played by Ellen Page, who played Treena Lahey in several early episodes of the Canadian cult hit comedy series, ""Trailer Park Boys"". Still, despite the reputation of ""Juno"", I wasn't expecting to like it very much from what I had read about it, and wasn't surprised when I was left puzzled about all the hype! <br/><br/>Juno MacGuff is sixteen years old and has recently had sex with a fellow high school student named Paulie Bleeker. Even though they are not in a steady relationship, Juno soon discovers that she has become pregnant from that session, and does not feel ready to become a mother, so she intends to have an abortion. However, she soon changes her mind and decides that she will have the baby and put it up for adoption. She searches the local Pennysaver for people who are looking to adopt, and comes across a couple she thinks are a good choice. They are Mark and Vanessa Loring, a very wealthy married couple who live in a large, expensive house and don't have any kids. Juno goes with her father to meet this couple at their house. The pregnant teenager soon gets to know the two of them and befriends Mark, discovering that she shares his taste in music and horror movies. At this point, it looks like Juno's plan for her baby will work out, but something could happen in the months remaining before the delivery.<br/><br/>I never liked the soundtrack, like I said, and actually seeing the film didn't change this. Not ALL the songs in this film are that bad, but there certainly are a number of memorably bad ones with truly awful vocal work! They sometimes sound like kids' songs, and this isn't even a kids' movie! Watching ""Juno"" showed me that there are certainly other major problems with it, not just the songs. It's supposed to be a combination of comedy and drama, and none of the jokes ever even put a smile on my face, so I can't say much for the comedy aspect. I take it Juno's father saying, ""Next time I see that Bleeker kid I'm going to punch him in the wiener,"" is supposed to be funny, but it's not, it's basically just a little weird! We also hear the lead character say, ""I haven't taken a dump since Wednesday,"" at one point. Thanks for sharing, Juno! Yes, there certainly are weak bits of dialogue in this film, and I also didn't find the characters in general too fascinating, nor did I care for the lingo spoken a lot here. As for the dramatic aspect of the movie, I'll admit, I did find some parts of it mildly touching and even meaningful starting at some point after the first hour, but this was not enough to cut it.<br/><br/>A while ago, I remember looking this film up and seeing that it was in the IMDb top 250, but I had never seen so many negative reviews on the first review page for a movie on that list before! As I write MY review, I can see that ""Juno"" isn't in the top 250 anymore, but it's still close. I doubt I would give a 4/10 to many movies with ratings this high, but I have to make an exception here. I don't hate this dramedy as much as some people do, and don't think everything about it is terrible, but I still find myself jumping on the ""overrated"" bandwagon. For the most part, I found this indie blockbuster very dull and uninteresting, with some fairly annoying aspects, and I can't imagine a second viewing changing my opinion for the better. For me, sitting through it once was enough, or maybe even more than enough! Others can say what they like about this critical and box office hit, but personally, I think it's mostly overrated trash."

","At first i'm totally in love with this movie, but then i found out the similarities that this movie had with a controversial south Korean movie two years earlier. Yeah, i know that the writer said she never watched that ""Jenny,JUNO"" movie...but if she haven't...what about the similarities?? And i come to the conclusion where, ""Hey, sex its not a big thing in US. But it Asian, its a BIG DEAL."" Other than that, the lines amazed me. Its hard to accept that kind of words would come out from a 15 years old girl. She seems to lost her manner, of else. Anyway, i rate 4 out of 10...to respect the actresses and actors..and the other people who work on this movie...but not to the writer!"

","I watched this film about a year ago, as that is when it came out here in England. I shan't lie, I thought it was delightful. It made me laugh and I concluded that Ellen Page was refreshing, as was the dialogue.<br/><br/>I watched it again about 2 months after, and once more a time after that. Both these times I was dumbstruck, to a point of speechlessness and my entire being, physically and mentally, had been lulled into an absolute state of rigid boredom.<br/><br/>Page and Cera act exactly the same character in every film they are in. And the 'refreshing' dialogue aforementioned, serves to do nothing but detract absolutely from a, frankly, wafer thin storyline. It's actually upsetting to identify what Juno fundamentally is. A marketing ploy. It was advertised as 'cool' and 'quirky' and 'indie', the movie's gone on to make close on 230 million US Dollars. I, like so many, was suckered in by this ploy. We've all been hoodwinked by Capitalism, Diablo Cody probably laughs herself to sleep, under her velvet sheets, on her gold plated bed frame."
"samkan","6","3","9","29 January 2009"," Ultimately Explotive
","Certainly its not taboo to make a comedy of a teen pregnancy. Rather, its how its done. This is a serious subject. The makers are allowed to believe that, because of the subject matter, there is a certain portion of the population that they'll NEVER be able to push a teen-pregnancy comedy past. However they appear to have ignored the portion of people (myself included)who can appreciate the human comedy of manners involved, if only a small nod is given to the reality of the circumstances. Instead JUNO goes straight to the folks (read, ""young"") who'd find all behavior acceptable and believe in the justification and likelihood of a happy ending for all.<br/><br/>The script is hilarious, especially Juno's dialog. Though her witticism, arrogance and intelligence are a bit too unbelievable, such serves as a good set-up for her comeuppance. Therein lies the problem - the ending. No messy consequences here! All characters are served, all is roses. Nothing to it. Back to teen idle. Happy motherhood. Guitar strumming romance.<br/><br/>I was a high school teacher who witnessed a rash of teen pregnancies. I've daughters 16 and 18 whose friends were ""knocked up"". More critically, as a lawyer I've been appointed to represent 100's of trouble juveniles, an overwhelming majority being of nontraditional family structure. A birth to teen parents can turn out well but MORE OFTEN THAN NOT results in economic and emotional hardships. I've done two private adoptions; i.e., one of the ""happy"" endings. The impact on the teen mother and her parent(s)was devastating. No devastation here.<br/><br/>Its a shame. Again the script was funny, e.g. To Juno:""Won't your parents be worry if you're home late?"" Juno: What for? I'm already pregnant"". Unfortunately, the outcome is exploitive."
"am_yer_maw","7","3","9","21 August 2008"," Facing the facts about Juno
","It is what it is. A daft, lightweight cutesy spin on teenage life, sex, complications and consequences. It's not meant to be some epic life changing piece of viewing that's going to rock your world. The purpose is to entertain, which it does. Of course it's not realistic, no parent would accept their child being in that position so well, nor would they approve so quickly of them having it adopted. Like all films, these things are embellished to keep the narrative going. I am fairly certain when they made this film they weren't looking to influence the teens of today, and its hardly a bad influence and it's aimed at an audience who are liable to be aware of this. And any teens or young children who are liable to go out and get pregnant will most certainly do so with or without seeing the film Juno. Surely the teen stars of today such as your Jamie Lynn's and Miley's who have a major tween audience tuning into their shows daily are a far more negative influence with pregnancies and topless photos. And if you pay attention the preferred reading of the film is a fairly sensible one at Juno's age she wasn't ready to be a mother and she realised that. Clearly thats a positive message for anyone of a similar age. And Vanessa showed that when you're ready for motherhood it will come around for you. At 16, it suggests it may not be the right time for you. If I'm a teenager and I can read that from it, I trust the majority of my generation can do the same."

","The movie is very sweet! There aren't any complicated things in this movie. Even when Juno's parents found out that their daughter is pregnant, they take it easily without any dramas and stuff. Ellen Page stared this movie as a complicated, laid-back teenager who got herself pregnant by her best friend, Bleeker (Michael Cera). Her acting was simple, but adorably sweet. This movie shows us that we don't need complicated, big budget movies with all the drama. Even though the film scoring in this movie filled by raw music (for example: light guitar sounds and the singers sing like they're talking fast and recorded in cheap studios) it's great! That's even make the movie more good because it matches with the plots. Two thumbs up to Diablo Cody for writing this movie script. Even the theme is quite often revealed in many movie, the way she wrote this story is really one of a kind."
"diac228","7","3","9","31 July 2008"," Things that make you go ""Awwwwwwwwww"" Volume #665221
","Back in 2007, a little Indie flick rises from the ashes of obscurity and finds its way into the underground pop culture. A small yet charming little story about a 16-year-old giving away the baby still inside her womb won the hearts of audiences and critics across the entire globe. Even the story behind the making of the story was something else, as Diablo Cody, an ex-stripper works her way up from humble beginnings as a well-known blogger. But, with every grand film that makes a surprising amount of money, comes the backlash. The screams of ""overrated,"" ""not that great,"" ""Propaganda,"" among other lashes have been hitting this film, and hard. So is Juno a film that was riding a wave of praise that suddenly crashes after the hype is gone? Or is it actually a decent film? <br/><br/>I've had my share of being in the backlash end of highly-praised and lower-budgeted independent movies like Sideways, Little Miss Sunshine, and especially (especially) Napoleon Dynamite. However, Juno doesn't quite fit the mold with the other movies previously mentioned. The story is indeed unique, the characters and their reactions are definitely different, and the script (despite unrealistic dialogue) is spectacular in its ability to blind you from what's happening next. While the morality, themes, and decisions are definitely up for debate and may find you cursing the screen, Juno is one of those little movies that can actually deliver. Few times can a movie run on purely amazing acting, but Juno has easily the best acting ensemble of 2007 and among the best this decade.<br/><br/>You should all know the story by now: Juno (Ellen Page) sleeps with her best friend (Michael Cera) and of course, winds up pregnant. However, the story twists in another direction because Juno decides to give up the baby to a couple (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) the second it is born, no questions asked. The rest of the movie deals with the struggles (emotional mostly, rarely do we see the physical side effects) Juno and her closest people face as the baby is one step closer to arriving in the real world. While Juno pursues the right ending to the ordeal, the conflict complicates itself, and emotions start running on overdrive at all the wrong moments.<br/><br/>One major complaint is about how easy Juno treats her pregnancy. To the observant eye, you can see that Juno hides her emotional stress underneath her sarcasm and bitter tone. This is the strongest and weakest point of Juno: the writing. The script itself contains layers upon layers of great dialogue, subtle themes, smart surprises, and wraps up the whole piece nicely by the end. However, there is such thing as a script being too smart and trying too hard, and Diablo Cody wrote herself into a corner. Juno herself is interesting, spunky, smart, but too smart for her own good. It is almost impossible for a 16-year-old to be able to have any sort of knowledge of the first punk movement in 1979, especially when it seems like she is the only one in her social circle that even knows of this. Her constant pop culture references are to things that existed way before she was born; her usage of words is much too strong for someone her age. Everyone else in the movie is believable, but Juno herself is sometimes too over-the-top.<br/><br/>While Juno is unbelievable, Ellen Page is not. Ellen Page does a great job portraying the sly main character, as she can also shed layers of emotion much like the script. However, we cannot forget the incredible performances of J.K. Simmons, Allison Janney, Michael Cera, and best of all Jennifer Garner. The persistence of Vanessa in the movie is perfectly done by Garner, who should at least have gotten some sort of Oscar nod. The acting carries this movie, and gives it a heavy dosage of realism and gritty passion that you will not find in the typical Hollywood flick. The movie tugs at your heart as the final act rolls around and we see everyone trying to be at their strongest spiritually.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: The backlash comes mostly from those who don't truly understand Juno. Juno isn't trying to beat a message about abortion over your head, its trying to give you a charming and distinctive tale about having to face maturity several years too soon. Juno was forced to ""grow up,"" albeit temporarily, because an ""adult"" event is occurring in her teenage life. Yes, her decisions may seem a bit strange, right from the getgo, but that's who Juno is. If we can accept a man killing people while wearing a mask resembling a clown, why can't we accept a teenager that enjoys moving furniture from inside her home to the front yard of someone else's? <br/><br/>With that said, its not the best script in years, like the Hollywood underground was saying. The movie was too smart, Juno was too smart, and relied a bit too much on pop culture. It's like Family Guy, except with actual heart and no randomness whatsoever. Diablo Cody obviously has the talent, now she has to tweak upon her mistakes made here. Juno is entertaining, will deliver laughs, is highly-quotable, and has a delightful little ending. You just want to hug this movie with all its cuteness. This movie is a bit on the overrated end, but isn't disappointing, unlike the average indie flick riding praise waves. If you want a different motion picture experience, I recommend Juno."

","I approached this film with some trepidation, knowing it to be highly rated critically, but leery of the subject matter. That being said. I took the plunge and rented it on DVD on the advice of one of my daughters.<br/><br/>It was flat. I can't say that I liked it, neither can I can say that I disliked it. It was certainly clever, but perhaps too clever for it's own good. The characters were two dimensional and the dialogue was too scripted. The main character was too cute and too glib. The film had potential, but failed to deliver. It was a very poignant and timely topic, but the ending told it all. Too superficial, too Hollywood, too good to be true. Perhaps it is a generational thing, but glossing over an unwanted pregnancy based on casual, even disinterested, sex, is just not true to life. It is an Indie film that tries so hard, but fails to deliver. It should not be in the top IMDb 250."

After seeing this preview and being absolutely memorized by Ellen Page, I just had to somehow sneak this movie in. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that so successfully and candidly fused all the elements of a good Indy movie together so astonishingly.

"3xHCCH","6","3","9","23 February 2008"," Juno's Parents are the Best Part of the Movie
","This is the fifth and last Best Picture nominee that I have seen. Just in the nick of time for the Oscar ceremony on Monday morning, which I won't be able to watch! Isn't that ironic? Anyway, of all the nominees, ""Juno"" is the most accessible to the casual movie fan. It is understandable why this is the only one of the five nominees to be a box office hit, grossing more than $100M.<br/><br/>The situations and the dialogues are so much closer to reality than the others. The plot is simple and direct, but the treatment is unique. It was interesting to note that the writer (Oscar nominated and likely winner of Best Original Screenplay) Diablo Cody used to be a stripper. I guess that would account for the avant garde yet frank treatment of the sensitive subject matter of teenage sex and pregnancy. The script has a decidedly feminine bent, showing the strengths of the women characters.<br/><br/>The musical score was very unusual. I cannot even define the genre of that music and those quirky jangly songs! Very interesting soundtrack.<br/><br/>The actors are really very good here, led of course by Ellen Page playing Juno. She is very believable in her portrayal of a strong sensible, smart-alecky high school girl whose unexpected pregnancy expectedly shakes up her life. I can't believe she is actually already 20 years old! Jennifer Garner is very remarkable as well playing the childless woman who wanted to adopt Juno's baby. She has very touching moments, and she was really effective in them. Especially that scene where she was talking to Juno's bulging tummy in the mall. There was also those tense scenes that dealt with complicated marital issues she had with her husband Mark (Jason Bateman).<br/><br/>My favorite couple in this movie are J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's dad and stepmom. If this movie was set in the Philippines, all hell would have broken loose in that scene where Juno confesses her pregnancy to her parents. There was none of that here, in a rather sharp contrast of cultures. They had very witty and snappy lines. Great scene of Allison giving the holier-than-thou ultrasound technician a piece of her mind.<br/><br/>Overall, it was admittedly better than I expected. However, I do not really think this is really Best Picture material. It won't go home empty-handed I would bet. I do think its main chance for an Oscar is for its Original Screenplay. That said, the morality issue will always be with this movie. What message exactly does it say and deliver to teens of today about teen pregnancy?"
"agmoldham","7","3","9","22 February 2008"," Dealing with stuff way past her maturity
","This is a hugely enjoyable film. Juno is a high school kid who has to deal with an unplanned pregnancy. She does this in a very matter of fact way and after toying with the idea of abortion decides to find foster parents. The remainder of the film takes us through to the birth of the child.<br/><br/>The real pleasure in the film is the acting and the interplay between the characters. The supporting cast including father (J.K. Simmons), step mother (Allison Janney), best friend (Olivia Thirlby), boyfriend (Michael Cera), and potential foster parents (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) all put in fine performances. Ellen Page will obviously take most of the plaudits for the lead role and deservedly so, as she makes Juno into both a very strong and sympathetic character.<br/><br/>In many ways Juno reminds me of Leon. It is a testament to Ellen Page that her performance certainly stands comparison with Natalie Portman although I suppose Portman was at then other side of the teenage years when she filmed Leon. Juno is also considerably more upbeat and whilst an unplanned pregnancy normally leads to much angst in movies it is simply something else to deal with for Juno. My only slight reservation is that it may run the risk of glamorising teenage pregnancy."

","I just watched this film for the second time, and I cannot begin to comprehend why it is going to win best original screenplay at the Oscars. There is absolutely no human emotion whatsoever for the first forty minutes of the film. Apparently, Diablo Cody believes everyone talks as if they were texting or on AIM, because the dialouge is not even moderately clever or amusing. Also, the characters are so poorly written, especially Juno's dad, who has nothing to do but make lame jokes and give typical fatherly advice to his daughter. Jason Reitman's bland direction feels as if he is trying to imitate Wes Anderson (a far superior filmmaker), yet doesn't really want to put in the effort. For the most part, the acting is pretty good, especially Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman. And the last thirty minutes are decent, but can't save the rest of the film. All in all, this is like a cheap spin-off of Scrubs and Arrested Development trying to be a Wes Anderson film."

I've never been in a situation like this before, but it really does show what can be the outcome of teenage pregnancy. Diablo Cody did a great job of having the plot be serious, but have funny one-liners that can keep you laughing throughout the movie but still be aware of the situation.

Juno is extremely bright without the air of arrogance or an invisible halo around her pretty face. She is bold enough to discuss her teen pregnancy condition and explore potential solutions. When Juno learns of her pregnancy, I liked the way she converses with the father of the baby(Michael Cera from Arrested Development), her own father,her step mom and her best friend(Olivia Thirlby, United 93). Her interactions with Jason Bateman ( Arrested Development)were appropriately handled. Jennifer Garner/Afleck as Vanessa had a very pleasant and realistic approach to a woman wanting motherhood with a passion. Ellen Page as Juno is very convincing as a teenager with her head on her own shoulders and feet firm on the ground. Her intelligent response to Vanessa's abandonment by her own husband Mark is superb.<br/><br/>Juno stayed true to her character and continued to live a free spirited life. She did what she thought was right for her and let others get what they want. Diablo Cody as the writer and Ellen Page as Juno deserve nominations for the Oscars."

"julioecolon","6","7","30","21 January 2008"," Half-baked bun in the oven
","There are many things that are redeemable about this film, but there are some flies in the ointment, as well. Let's start with what is not so good: The screenplay, which is hugely uneven, and has Juno and Leah spouting off one round after another of conceited but hugely clever, sixteen-year-old assessments of the world, in ways that no sixteen-year-old I have ever been around is able to do. Most sixteen-year-olds are anxious to sound adult, but what usually comes out of their mouths are carefully rehearsed, oft-repeated catch phrases that make the utterer sound and seem irretrievably stupid. Some of the quirkiness (and therefore attractiveness) in Juno has to do with her individuality, but she doesn't sound too terribly original when she insists that Iggy Pop made the best music that ever was (this sounds like something a teenager desperate to be different might have read and latched onto in Rolling Stone magazine), nor does she strike one as all that cool when she is shown with a cheeseburger phone that would certainly have seemed more fitting in the hands of a five-year-old. Worse yet, she decides to seduce the school dweeb, Bleeker, a boy with very little going for him except for his genetically inherited propensity for study and quietude. Unfortunately, the resolution in the film concerning Juno's relationship with Bleeker is far from satisfactory and left me wondering if I had just been to Disney. Juno's parents aren't nearly as upset as one would expect when she reveals the rather tawdry consequences of her seduction to them; but it's the heroic gesture made by Juno, to find good, loving parents for her soon-to-be-born child, that is the most muddled in this film. We are shown the characteristic suburban homes in the neighborhoods of the nouveau-riche (where the adoptive parents reside), all cookie-cutter in design and therefore lacking in originality; and I do believe that we are meant at first to dislike the adoptive mother, who comes off looking like a control freak who has stifled the last remnants of love out of a childless marriage. But then the screenwriter makes a U-turn and suddenly this woman is the victim, and the baby hers to keep, despite the break-up of the loveless marriage and the departure of the ex-husband for way cooler digs, a loft in the city. The screenwriter was at pains to show the class differences between Juno's parents and the adoptive parents, but he fumbles the ball by putting all the foul language in Juno's step-mother's mouth and by showing her out to be a hoyden most likely to take umbrage if you cross your eyes at her step-daughter: the tirade she engages in against the technician at the hospital, for example, is pointless. If it's meant to show the white working-class animus toward Hispanics, it doesn't quite work. And, it sounds terribly contrived, at the end, when Juno admits, as she's lying in her hospital bed with the dweeb, that the baby had never been her own from the start and had always really belonged to the adoptive mother. Good things about this movie: the performances of Alison Janney and J.K. Simmons, who were given precious little to work with, but who manage, just the same, to give the film some backbone; Jason Bateman's scenes with Juno are marvelously delivered. Ellen Page, on the other hand, needed to tone down the staccato rhythm of her interjections and give her character breathing room."

","I loved this movie and I can't believe the rating other people have given it. If you have any sense of humor at all, you'll like this movie. Yeah, it contains a controversial issue, but I really like how Diablo Cody went about it while writing it. Believe it or not, this is real.A lot of naive parents believe that this doesn't happen to teens, but it does. IT DOES HAPPEN. The music is original and fits in with the movie and this movie is not a waste of time. <br/><br/>Ellen Page and Jennifer Gardner exceed expectations in this movie, adding to the overall tone and just about every emotion possible. So if you have not seen this movie, go rent it."

","Once I saw the trailer, I did not want to see this film. In fact, I was reluctant even now to pick up this film. I am glad I did. This is just a great movie with something you might pick up on.<br/><br/>The story is about a small town girl named Juno. She and her best friend have sex in a chair and that gets Juno pregnant. Now she has to face the realities of teenage pregnancy and she must find loving parents for her child.<br/><br/>For a movie that expected to be an indie film, there are a lot of A-list actors and they were brilliant. I liked Ellen Page as the sarcastic Juno. Michael Cera is excellent as the nerdy boyfriend. I liked everyone else especially J.K Simmons, Jason Bateman, and Jennifer Gardner.<br/><br/>The music certainly adds to the mood of the film. Most of the songs are feel-happy songs. Basically, this movie is a feel-happy movie with an important message.<br/><br/>This is a great movie and a surprise box office hit. I rate this film 9/10."

","I started out thinking that Juno (Ellen Page)was a little too much of a smart alec, but about a 1/4 of the way through the film I warmed up to her charm. I liked the folksy music they played in the film, I think it set the mood well. Even though I did not get all the youth references (I am in my 40's)I did laugh out loud a few times during some of the dialogue. I was moved by this picture and Juno's relationship with Bleeker. The part about the dysfunctional upper class couple reminded me of American Beauty. I can see why a lot of people liked this movie, I started out kind of lukewarm on it, but remained interested all the way to end."

","""Juno"" is about a quick-witted 16-year-old girl named Juno MacGuff who's faced with an unplanned pregnancy. During the nine months of carrying her baby, she faces events that go ""beyond her maturity level."" I have to say, this film surprised me. I had heard so many good things about it, yet at the same time, so many bad things about it. Still, I saw it, and I loved it. The dialog is so clever, and the characters are so lifelike and weird. And that's also why I loved it, because of its weirdness. Sure, a lot of the characters had the same wit, but it's still great nonetheless.<br/><br/>Also, there's a wonderful message in choice.

"knifey-spoony","10","2","5","13 October 2008"," My thoughts on Juno
","Its not often a movie zooms into my top 5 after just two viewings, but then its not often a film like Juno comes along.<br/><br/>The logical place to start would be Ellen Page. I can imagine some would find her performance somewhat smug and overly self-assured. But for me, she nails down the expectations of this razor sharp script in an effortless way. A brilliantly confident and hilarious lead as Juno, I found myself rooting from her right from the off whilst the whole time knowing things would work out in her favour.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is faultless. I've long been an Arrested Development worshipper, and Michael Cera and Jason Bateman bring all their finest qualities from the Bluth roles to their characters here. Despite his young age and apparent typecasting, Cera is the king of understated heroism. He has stolen just about every scene of his career so far and none so much as Paulie Bleeker. Bateman as Mark Loring is everything you wanted Michael Bluth to be; living out the dreams and ideals instead of simply fulfilling the family expectations in exchange for a peaceful life. Its almost enough to make me give Teen Wolf II another go. Almost.<br/><br/>I vaguely recognised JK Simmons, but had seen little of Jennifer Garner and Alison Janney prior to this. Which makes it difficult for me to label this the 'performance of their careers', but I'll blindly do it anyway. Simmons I'd always pictured as a bad guy, but his turn here as Mac was one of the most endearing paternal portrayals I can remember. Quite touching, and award-worthy. His scene with Juno as she realises her love for Paulie was beautiful. Garner's shopping mall monologue to the 'bump' and Janney springing to life as she lays into the ultrasound technician are other examples of actors right on top of their game.<br/><br/>The setting is perfect. I've never been to America, but this Fargo-esquire Minnesota backdrop is what I picture every time. The kids are cool, but not too cool; the families are functional, but not too functional. The symbolism of the seasons and the underlying theme of the high school runners allay perfectly into my totally-unfounded-and-unresearched ideology of Minnesotan life... just carrying on, whatever the drama inbetween. No time for politics or grander social issues here. The film has drawn controversy for its apparent pro-life theme but I see it as merely a story-telling mechanism rather than any kind of social statement. My one concern throughout was Juno's lack of self-realisation about the obvious emotion such a predicament would bring, and it was a relief to see it all come pouring out towards the end as she laid crying on the hospital bed.<br/><br/>This film is the ultimate compromise between funny, bittersweet and cool. The music is sublime throughout. The pace and length are perfect. The characters are just the right distance into leftfield from what you'd expect them to be. The ending is happy without being horribly predictable.<br/><br/>For me, and my own peculiar tastes, I can't fault it. Ten out of ten."
"MozaredTFT","9","2","5","1 August 2008"," Why all the hate and a balloon-tempered movie
","""Why all the hate?"" is what I'm asking myself while scrolling trough all the comments on this movie. The recurring bits I noticed were people stating the language is too 'fake', the movie is too easy on subjects like teenage pregnancy and abortion, and Ellen Page's (apperantly) awful acting.<br/><br/>I must say I strongly disagree with all of these. If you're bothered by the language then in my opinion you are really missing the point of the movie. The quick-witted quasi-wannabe-cool language used somewhat 'lightens' the subject of the movie up. It fits in exactly with the what I'd like to call 'balloon-temper' of the movie. It's a light, easy and entertaining way to look at teenage pregnancy. While still being very true; I think I know a few teenage girls who would opt the same decision.<br/><br/>And the acting was one thing that struck me as pretty much lethally good. One of those girls I've mentioned saw the movie herself and loves it; and I can't blame her, since I reckon she's quite alike Juno. Just look at the way Page's eyes and mouth move when she says simple words like ""dude"". Bad acting? Pure brilliance is the only words I have for it. A movie character is actually really alike a real-life friend. Tell me how often that happens? <br/><br/>I reckon people who think this movie is bad simply miss the point of it. I for one watched it one evening, became too stupefied to judge it, watched it again the evening after and then decided it's just an incredibly good movie. But a bit like the movie AmÃ©lie, I suppose it's something you either like or hate. Just watch the first 3 minutes of the movie, including the parts where the intro credits roll. If you hate that kind of style, turn off the movie. If you like it, you're in for a roller-coaster."

Its her natural and honest performance which has touched quite a few hearts. Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner have both done great jobs too. It is hard to believe that an actress so young as Ellen could deliver such a brilliant and mature performance like she did. The movie has an uniform flow which keeps the audience enthralled.

I understand that Diablo Cody won an Oscar for the script, and she deserves it.<br/><br/>All the acting was fine, but I felt that Ellen Page was outstanding as Juno, playing a very convincing 16-year-old in such a way that you feel Juno's pain and confusion along with her. She has a promising acting career ahead of her.<br/><br/>Juno is one of those films that plays to the heart and that stays with you for hours or days after you have left the theater.

","I must be honest -- when I was told that I was going to have to watch Juno (with no choice in the matter), I honestly wanted to cut off one of my fingers to have an excuse to leave the room. Luckily, I decided against such morbid actions and stuck it out. While this movie's forward-facing plot may sound excruciatingly ""chick flick""-ish, it surprises in ways I never thought was possible.<br/><br/>The acting, particularly by Ellen Page, was absolutely spot-on. Her true look into the life of a sarcastic pregnant teenager was both unforgettable and gut-wrenching. Two sides of June that were ironically opposite were her longing and sense of independence and her naive ideas on marriage and having children. The turn of mood throughout the movie (and especially one scene of her emotional outbreak) threw the audience on a roller coaster ride.<br/><br/>However, the vast majority of the movie was light hearted and full of intellectual wit and charm. Ellen Page lights up the screen with her personality. It would not surprise me if she inspires a generation of girls acting very similarly to her character.<br/><br/>And, it goes without saying, the writing was unbelievably talented. The one-liners in the movie were enough to keep me on the floor with laughter and yet created a sense of solidarity in the characters. It's very rare in which the writing compliments the character's background. This is one of those rare occasions.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: ""I wonder if Ellen Page is looking for a boyfriend?""

","Granted, the surface message of the movie may seem a little encouraging to young girls who want to get pregnant but that's only to those who aren't paying attention to the depth of the movie. What many of the reviewers who are grading this as a happy perky movie that is a false representation of real life are missing are the tears that Juno sheds in the end. It's clear to me that she's hurting and despite the happy feeling of the movie, she obviously suffers for her decision throughout the entire pregnancy from not only the trials of being pregnant but from the social standpoint as well. Not every young pregnancy ends up in an abortion or parental misery as so many seem to believe. There are actually kids with supportive parents out there and plans to take care of the child once it's born. It's nice to actually see a movie that focuses on the life of one such teenager versus the usual portrayals. What I really enjoyed were all of the jokes and such about her pregnancy because having kids myself, they hit home. I loved all of the characters, they were believable and warm, all of the actors and actresses did very well bringing them to life on the screen. I felt that the script was believable as well, even making me think of people that I knew. What I didn't like was the music. Egads, the opening song almost forced a twitch out of me and we didn't find out if there was anything special in the credits because I wanted the music off as soon as possible. Besides that, I really enjoyed this movie and will be adding it to my collection."

The movie never got boring and made me laugh a lot. The main character, played by Ellen Page, has a very positive outlook on life. She may swear, have sex, and talk to adults like they were kids, but this personality was unique. In all, this movie is the must see movie of 2007 and a great movie to represent 2007."
"Spookwhiskey","8","2","5","28 March 2008"," Film Review - Juno
","If Jason Reitman's Thank You For Smoking was a showroom Mercedes, all sleek corporate chic and glistening cool, then Juno is the BMX you've had since highschool: perhaps unable to shoulder the expectations you've unfairly placed upon it, but crafted, nonetheless, with a genuine skill and in possession of an undeniable charm.<br/><br/>When sixteen-year-old Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) falls pregnant following a formative sexual dalliance with best-bud Bleeker (Michael Cera), the precocious teen makes an atypical decision regarding the fate of her womb's newest occupant. Determined to both have the child and find for it a loving home, Juno strikes up a relationship with her unborn's soon-to-be adoptive parents, only to discover teenage pregnancy isn't all its knocked up to be.<br/><br/>Spearheaded by a revelatory performance from its fiery young lead, Juno is the most satisfying comedy of the season. Where Reitman used the slick veneer of Thank You For Smoking to cut an incisive dissection of glib yuppie smarm, here he uses Juno's hyper-pop hipness and scruffy appeal to extol the virtues of family and teenage camaraderie. If Diablo Cody's retro-cool screenplay at first seems to have repopulated the suburban geek la mode neverwhere of Napoleon Dynamite from a feminine slant, rest assured, as Juno is revealed its own being entirely once we better settle into proceedings. Cody's script in fact proves one of the film's greatest strengths, its simple narrative defying expectations at most every turn and developing well-realised relationships between memorable characters. Married with Reitman's directorial snazziness, it makes for a rich, surprising experience, equally fulfilling as it is entertaining.<br/><br/>Delivering here on the promise displayed in David Slade's technically fantastic but emotionally bogus Hard Candy, Page shows herself well on the way to becoming a household name; that Oscar nomination comes not without credence. We look forward to the day when the age of her characters runs in step with her own, as the lightning-bright teen with the whiplash retorts bag initially proves mildly distracting. But Page wins us over, making defunct any ""Kids don't talk like that!"" beef, with a performance both hilarious and tender. Her rapidfire deadpanning and persistent good-humour make Juno a hero to root for, and, thanks to her subtle command of emotional complexity, one who remains ever more compelling for her numerous flaws.<br/><br/>Following Superbad, Michael Cera confirms he could play awkwardly pleasant for the rest of his life and still manage to keep it engaging, whilst J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney lend wisdom and warmth as Juno's father and pet-loving stepmum. Janney's flagrant berating of a standoffish ultrasound nurse provides the film one of its genuine laugh-out-loud moments, and the pair's private reaction to the news of Juno's pregnancy is one of its quiet highpoints. Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner each rise to the occasion as Juno's adoptive-parents-of-choice for the bun in her oven; Garner in particular has never been better than here.<br/><br/>Indeed, all about Juno is so intrinsically good that the film's biggest problem in fact proves external. What should have been an excellent little film to discover and cherish has been so forward-pushed that its slender frame buckles beneath the weight of bloated expectations on which it never anticipated having to deliver.<br/><br/>A small and wholly impressive work sporting excellent performances and a pitch-perfect Kimya Dawson-led soundtrack, Juno shines thanks to a clever screenplay and a confident director. Forget the praise and publicity and enjoy the film on its own terms - as the smart little comedy with the big, pulsing heart."
"kornrocker65","8","2","5","25 March 2008"," Review
","Juno is a movie about a sixteen year old who gets pregnant. No, it's not an episode of Maury, it's the story of a young girl who gets pregnant and tries to find a couple to adopt while, as she puts it, deals with ""things way beyond my maturity level.""<br/><br/>Juno is a very good, unique story and one of my favorite movies of the year. If you ask me (and in a sense you are.) the real star of this film is the script. Written by first time screenwriter Diablo Cody, Juno really is as they say ""this year's little miss sunshine"" It's refreshingly original, quirky and funny. It is also very heartwarmingbut only towards the end. Through the majority of the film, like little miss sunshine, things pretty much get worse for the protagonists as time goes on but it is certainly not without laughs throughout. Besides, that is what makes the ending all the more powerful. The thing that struck me the most was the honesty in the dialogue. It certainly isn't completely realistic and Juno and her friend have more witty things to say then is probably natural but nonetheless, the dialogue in the film is probably more realistic than most. The film's acting is also something of note. Ellen Page, who was nominated for an Oscar for her role, delivers a great performance. In addition, the other actors in the film, such as Michael Cera and Jason Bateman also give good performances. Like his other roles, Michael Cera who plays Juno's love interest (more or less), plays awkward better than any actor I have seen. If you've seen Superbad or any episode of Arrested Development than you know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Juno is defiantly a movie worth seeing. Juno defiantly isn't a laugh-out-loud kind of comedy but I don't think that's what they're going for. With a good cast, simple humor, and a believable script, you can't really go wrong and I don't think they did."
"albert-wayne","10","2","5","13 March 2008"," It all started and ended in...greatness.
","The absolute ""must see"" Indie movie of the year, cause it has one of the most wittiest screenplays of recent times, it's so honest, so poignant, so fresh, young, original, smart and on top of that, funny as hell. <br/><br/>Juno is a strange amalgamate between a Jared Hess movie and a Judd Apatow movie, but, this is not a complaint, being compared to such is a great compliment, but, that doesn't mean that Juno is a movie that just takes those two formulas, the Hess movie and the Apatow movie, mixing them and giving birth to some strange mutant movie. Juno has it's own beat, rhythm, laughs, and most importantly, wit and heart. <br/><br/>Diablo Cody's screenplay for Juno is undoubtedly one of the best screenplays recently written. It's so rich in details, characters, situations, drama, comedy, and some of the best, most original, and truthful dialog. Diablo Cody is definitely the main protagonist of this movie's reputation as the ""it"" Indie movie of the year. <br/><br/>The other incredible protagonist is it's protagonist, Ellen Page as Juno is incredible, an acting tour De force, what this beautiful 21 year old has accomplished in the movie is truly amazing, a character so complex, rich in details and mannerisms, and as an audience member you can't help but love her, with all her inequities, she is one of the most lovable characters on film. I will certainly keep an eye on Miss Page from now on. The supporting cast was incredible, it was a casting made in heaven, and it played out beautifully, the great veterans Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons were so funny and effective as Juno's parents, Jason Bateman from Arrested Development was very effective, it was great to see Jennifer Garner take this role. And of coarse, the always funny Michael Cera was so convincing and funny as Juno's male counterpart, it truly seems like casting destiny, he was great in Superbad, and he was great in Juno. <br/><br/>Another element that people probably won't notice too much is the skillful direction by Jason Reitman. He made very clever choices with the film. His vision made the film even more poetic than what it already was. This movie, oddly enough was very easy to mess up, by trying to make it more funny, but Reitman sticks to the story, the characters and just let's things play out with a slight touch here and there that make the film look so effortless, which is fantastic. <br/><br/>Another element that was truly inspiring was the Production Design, Art Direction and Set Decoration, Steve Saklad, Michael Diner, Catherine Schroer Shane Vieau created one of the most unique and realistic looking films in a very long time, again, everything looks so honest, so lived in, which is very hard to do when Designing a film. <br/><br/>I know that this movie doesn't seem like the smart, intellectual Indie movie that makes it big every year, 2003 was Lost in Translation, then came Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind then Little Miss Sunshine, and now, we have Juno, which is just as great as those films I mentioned, and a lot more, trust me, it's a film experience that should not be missed."

"dougrob173","4","4","14","14 April 2008"," Not that good
","8.2 is extremely overrated for this film. I suspect most of the high votes are from all the fangirls who like to see Michael Cera.<br/><br/>First off, it's not really a comedy as listed in the genre tags, it's really just a drama with some attempts at comedy. The funniest part was the cameo of Dwight Schrute from The Office and even that part was over the top fake - just a series of one liner jokes. All of the characters are just shallow in their development, the main character, Juno was scripted as just someone who attempts to comment on everything with a one line joke, most of which are just dumb, and all are extremely unrealistic. Whoever wrote the script forgot to write these jokes as part of the character, instead it feels like Diablo Cody had all these jokes he wanted to say in a movie and just tagged them on to the lines of Juno's character.<br/><br/>Michael Cera is his typical self, which is to say, not acting at all. The way he talks, his character, his mannerisms are the same as every single movie he's in, which again is just proof that he is not an actor, just a pretty face all the fangirls want to see on screen. When he actually takes on a role different than just playing his everyday self on screen, I will have some respect for him as an actor. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman were the two best performers in this film, especially Bateman. They at least fleshed out their characters well and gave a sense of realism to their roles.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a typical indy, pretty boring slice of life film with nothing entertaining in it. Very misleading score."

Maybe I liked it because i saw my self in it and wished i could have fared as well as any of the characters in there... in their normal, happy, middle class suburban multi cultural broken and repaired family life. and the sound track was great too.

She is faced with tough choices and makes decisions based on a variety of sources including her parents advice which makes for a refreshing movie, unlike the seeming status quo these days of showing the kids running the household and the parents pandering to their every whim.<br/><br/>All of the other characters played supporting roles to Juno who basically carried the movie from beginning to end, and all of the cast was brilliant.

"Jonny_Numb","7","4","14","13 January 2008"," Spitfire ""Juno"" kicks ""Knocked Up"" to the curb
","2007 has been the year of the overrated pregnancy comedy, with last summer's ""Knocked Up"" and now ""Juno"" as recipients of hype and high box office. Unlike most of the critical populace (save for a few clear-headed writers like Maryann Johanson), I found little to like in Judd Apatow's film, and was particularly turned off by its lack of realismin spite of the critical accolades it received, I found its plot machinations (and jokes) to be the stuff of stale-sitcom artificiality and Hollywood Happy Endings. I approached ""Juno"" similar to how I approached ""Knocked""it's getting a lot of press, so I'll see it.<br/><br/>And while ""Juno"" has its share of problems (which I'll get to later), it knocks ""Knocked Up"" to the curb. The story follows 16-year old Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page""Hard Candy""), who finds herself impregnated by soft-spoken track star Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera""Superbad""), and the ensuing ups and downs that come from the appraisal of her classmates, her parents, and even the couple who volunteers to adopt the yet-unborn. Whereas ""Knocked"" carefully blew off issues like abortion (hit the punchline, cut to next scene!), it is the first thing Juno discusses with her best friendand while there is an undercurrent of humor to her visit to the clinic (where a classmate holds a solitary protest outside), this setpiece never ventures into cartoon terrain.<br/><br/>While Juno herself comes off as the lost sister of the ""Ghost World"" girls, and her character and dialog can be incredibly caustic for caustic's sake (first-time screenwriter Diablo Cody's hipper-than-thou barbs are frequently over-the-top and almost trivialize the more controlled elements of the story), there is a surprising relativity in Page's performance that eventually transcends what, at first, seems like an immature, one-note teenage character.<br/><br/>The same can be said for the ensemble cast surrounding her. Cody's script and Jason Reitman's direction cleverly works the characters from straightforward caricatures (the perpetually-perky adoptive mother; the dog-obsessed stepmother; the cheerleader friend; the dim jock) to fleshed-out, three-dimensional people whom we genuinely care about. For its first hour, ""Juno"" made me smile a lot, even laugh a few times, but only in its last third did it take on a level of complexity that gave way to a humbling maturity in Juno and those around her. I honestly did not expect the dramatic elements to kick in with such wrenching force, but they do, and they are seen through to their most logical conclusion. By the end, ""Juno"" had touched me in a manner that made ""Knocked Up"" seem all the more clueless.<br/><br/>While I'll grant that ""Juno"" earns its laughs and tears honestly, it can also be pretentious in spots. Reitman, whose ""Thank You for Smoking"" struck me as a slick yet show-offy ensemble comedy, frequently seems to be cribbing Wes Anderson's stark aesthetic and twist-of-fate life lessons. Additionally, the soundtrack of indie songs with the minimalist guitar and faux-poetic lyrics is overincorporatedwhile I understand that it's symbolizing the mentality of a teenage girl who's a bit pretentious herself, too many scenes are punctuated by it, to the point of redundancy. And even the animated opening-credits sequence seems to be invoking the Daniel Clowes-created ""Ghost World"" with another nod toward the distinctive portraits that appear in Anderson's films. On a plot level, the relationship between Juno and Paulie is developed in brief snippets throughout the film, but the plot turns in the last act don't jell quite as well as they shouldwhile there's a satisfactory (and perfectly believable) closure for the characters, it seems to be missing a few steps.<br/><br/>But ""Juno"" is ultimately a modestly endearing film despite its aesthetic missteps, using a deceptively simple plot device to tell a tale that cuts to the heart of a teenager's emotional core, and presents the leap into maturity as something as painful as labor, albeit with its rewards in the end. Not one of 2007's best films, but easily the best pregnancy comedy (of errors).<br/><br/>6.5 out of 10"

","JUNO (2007) **** Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney, J.K. Simmons, Olivia Thirlby, Rainn Wilson. Wonderfully acerbic comedy about the titular teen (Page in a star-making tour-de-force comic role), who finds herself pregnant by her sort-of-boyfriend Cera (perfecting awkward into an art form), and deciding to give it up for adoption, possibly to a too-good-to-believe yuppie couple (Garner and Bateman equally deserving huzzahs). A sharp, tart, and smart screenplay by novice wunderkind Diablo Cody and directed with wily brilliance by Jason Reitman, creating a warm, devastatingly funny and surprisingly touching modern-day comedy classic in the making thanks also to the talented ensemble including vets Simmons and Janney as Page's all-too-understanding yet suffering parents. Truly a delight from the get-go with its curdled, archness blending with its gooey center  a chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter-slice of perfection. One of the year's very best."

","the ""teen movie"" certainly lends itself to stylized dialogue (see: Heathers, Clueless, Brick), but unlike in those films, Juno finds its footing rather awkwardly. the first ten minutes or so are patience-testing as the patois is established, and too often veers into hipster-posturing. but once the ""adults"" show up, things brighten considerably. the ever-reliable J.K. Simmons and Alison Janney are perfectly cast as Ellen Page's parents and provide most of the film's most effective moments. (Page continues to display an impressive promise.) there are funny moments/lines through-out, some nice bits of film-making (my favorite being the sequence of the busticated mini-van driving past a series of upper-class suburban manses), and a great soundtrack (extra points awarded for using Buddy Holly's obscure gem ""Dearest""). the crucial flaw for me was the fact that Juno was the only complete character in the movie  most of the surrounding characters (despite how well-played they were) amounted to little more than sketches, and without them being fleshed-out more thoroughly, the movie ultimately felt solipsistic. i had other, more minor qualms as well (for example, i definitely felt the abortion/choice issue was handled rather glibly, and several of the pitfalls of the amerindie-whimsy trend were far from avoided). but overall, it's an enjoyable picture  i don't understand the ecstatic reception it's receiving, but i do think it's worth seeing."

","Lemme start by saying this movie is in no way a modern classic comedy. ""Superbad"" is is my opinion the best comedy to come out in years which is why i even checked this one out. This feel-good comedy portrays our lovable teenage protagonist Juno who is caught up in hormones and bangs her best friend Bleeker and gets pregnant. All the characters in this film are written the exact same way which makes it very hard to empathize with any of them. The characters all have a cumulative personality and could have been interchangeable. Worst yet it has a very pretentious feel to it and can only be described as lackluster. The movie goes nowhere fast. While some moments are funny, and Michael Cera and Ellen Page try to save the overwritten script, it fails on all four corners of film making as a whole. While there are some redeeming values in Juno, overall this movie is just your average teenage feel-good comedy and should only be viewed if you are bored and cant figure what to do with 96 minutes of your life. 5/10"

","What can I say about Juno without dragging on and on (or repeating to many quotes)? Honestly, this movie never ceases to amaze me. The characters are real and memorable, and Juno McGuff is not just the average, shy, wholesome American teenager you see getting knocked up in every single teen pregnancy movie that has come out. The story is unexpected, and has a real grit to it that so many people overlook. This movie was overall, very humble and simple compared to the very in-your-face movies that we as a society have become so used to. It has touched me in a way that no other story has, and it has done it in a very relateble, real outlook on life kid of way. I don't want to spoil the movie for those of you who have not yet watched it, and I don't want to ramble on about how gosh-darn adorable Ellen Page and Micheal Cera were together (even though it is SOOO true), but I'll make it easy for you.

I feel so close to her character. I know that if I was in her situation, this movie would describe almost perfectly what would happen. Even her friends are just like mine. I watched the movie and I couldn't even tell it was scripted. The way they talk is so close to the way my friends talk. I loved every aspect of this movie. I found this movie to be truly amazing.

The humor (though perhaps a bit 'unrealistic' as some have called it), was superb. The movie was touching and sad at all the right moments.<br/><br/>This movie won't appeal to everyone.

","Juno was such an amazing movie. It touched on subjects untouched by other movies like abortion and adoption and issues with adoption, you don't usually see. It's not predictable and it's fresh. The characters weren't translucent. You wanted to know more about everybody. I personally think that this would make a great television series. The sarcasm is wonderful. I wanted to know more about the relationship between Juno and Michael Cera's character and how it happened. The layout of the movie is uniquely split into seasons. Jennifer Garner's character you love to hate in the beginning but takes an unpredictable turn in the end. Most of all, and I know I've already said this, but it's unpredictable. I expected it to be girl gets pregnant, gives it up for adoption, she and high school boyfriend fall in love, adoptive family lives happily ever after.

","This movie was really, really, really, amazing! My whole theater was packed, there were people sitting on the floor just to watch it.

She can go from funny to heartbreaking in a few seconds flat. I've never seen a movie that felt so real. No matter what age group you fall into Juno will be a delight for you to watch. It really gives you hope that good things can come out of bad things and sometimes even the wrong time for things is the right time. <br/><br/>This movie is definitely worth the watch."
"bloom597742","10","3","10","30 December 2007"," Mixture of Romance and Comedy
","Juno is about a story with a girl and an unplanned pregnancy. Juno faces many challenges trying to find how two people stay together their whole life. I was very surprised to experience how much this movie got to me. This movie got to me the most because Juno made the best solution possible to her situation. What are the first thoughts that come to mind when you hear a 16-year-old girl pregnant? The most common words would be a troublemaker getting into shenanigans. Juno completely turns this around and she overcomes the challenges of society with flying colors adding the cherry on top known as comedy to the situation. The main surprise I received from this film was the unique mixture of romance and comedy mixed into one film. I never saw another film that pulled this off so effectively and if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I would not have believed it was possible to do. I don't believe the advertisement was good enough for this film, but nonetheless I guarantee this film will touch anyone. Many people say that unplanned pregnancies are no joke and comedy should not be pulled from it. However, I say that Juno picked the right path and people have no right to declare this. This just proves that anyone can make a terrible situation into a terrific situation. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and I guarantee you will enjoy this movie no matter what and I definitely give this a hard earned 10/10.<br/><br/>Jake"

"EUyeshima","9","4","16","17 December 2007"," Uniquely Eccentric Tale of Teen Pregnancy Elevated by a Sharp Script and a Strong Ensemble
","I have to admit that when I see a preview for a movie about a pregnant teenager, my first thought always goes back to conventional Lifetime TV soapers like ""Fifteen and Pregnant"" and ""Mom at Sixteen"". However, director Jason Reitman (who proved to have a wry, ironic eye with ""Thank You for Smoking"") and first-time screenwriter Diablo Cody, who previously worked as a stripper and phone sex operator, have concocted a genuinely quirky, surprisingly tender dramedy that takes the cliché-ridden story idea and fleshes it out with so many recognizable idiosyncrasies and so much insightful wit that the subgenre feels reborn.<br/><br/>The plot centers on a suburban Minneapolis sixteen-year old named Juno MacGuff, who finds herself pregnant after an experiment in chair-bound seduction with her shy classmate, a geeky, Tic-Tac-popping runner named Paulie Bleeker. Instead of focusing on dramatic confrontations with the parents or morphing into a diatribe on the right-to-life-or-choose debate, Reitman and Cody follow Juno's natural emotional impulses as she awkwardly attempts to figure out the best course of action to take. Things start to look promising when Juno finds a young upscale couple to adopt her baby - Vanessa is a controlling professional with perfectionist tendencies, while her husband Mark is an easy-going composer of commercial jingles, an aging Peter Pan-type whom Juno sees as a kindred spirit with a mutual fondness for rock music, slasher movies and comic books.<br/><br/>What I particularly like about the movie is how it portrays Juno as someone who holds no illusion of becoming a mother and yet discovers the emotional intelligence to match her maddeningly clever smart-mouthing. In fact, I had concerns about the persistence of the slang-heavy dialogue at the outset but was relieved to find the movie settle into sharp bantering exchanges that make way for more human dimensions. As proved with ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and ""Lars and the Real Girl"", a perfectly compatible ensemble can make all the difference with a movie as character-rich as this one. Fortunately, the cast is terrific starting with Ellen Page's prodigious turn in the title role. As a follow-up to her knockout work in ""Hard Candy"", she is impressive in revealing a fearless vulnerability under her character's disconcerting self-possession. As Bleeker, Michael Cera nicely provides a quiet gravity in response to Juno's volatility.<br/><br/>There is great work by J.K. Simmons as Juno's no-nonsense dad and especially Allison Janney as her acid-tongued, dog-loving stepmother (her verbal teardown of the patronizing ultrasound technician is classic). The surprise comes from the sturdy work by Jason Bateman, bringing palpable, almost wistful regret to Mark, and the gorgeous Jennifer Garner truly affecting in conveying Vanessa's unfulfilled state. More predictable are Olivia Thirlby as Juno's teacher-obsessed best friend Leah and Rainn Wilson in a cameo as a smart-alecky convenience store clerk. Indie folk singer Kimya Dawson composed and performs the amusing songs that bridge the seasonal changes in the story. This film is a genuine winner strongly recommended."
"ferguson-6","9","4","16","15 December 2007"," All The Young Dudes
","Greetings again from the darkness. Much ado about screenwriter Diablo Cody's stripper past. If this script is any indication, maybe stripping should be mandatory for all Hollywood writers. It is funny, touching and moving ... all with a major dose of reality and social commentary. Director Jason Reitman (""Thank You For Smoking"") has a definite feel for human angst when life delivers one of its many blows. Cody and Reitman deliver a fascinating story and an entertaining film at the highest level.<br/><br/>Ellen Page (kinda creepy in ""Hard Candy"") plays Juno, a spirited 16 yr old who winds up pregnant after seducing her best friend. Because of her age, Page's performance will probably not receive the notice it should. It is among the year's finest. Her sharp with and telling eyes and deadpan delivery make Juno someone we instantly care about, but not in a sappy way. Anyone with this much soul and spirit warrants our interest. Michael Cera (""Superbad"") plays the track star-unlikely lover-boy, who maintains a sense of cool despite everything. Cera is fine casting, but the whole track star thing was impossible to buy for any guy who has ever run at all. Still that one minor quibble doesn't drag the film down at all. Some of the best scenes in the film are Cera and Page together, battling through teenager emotions.<br/><br/>What takes this film to a whole other level is the peak behind the suburban utopia with Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. Unable to conceive on their own, they take out an ad and end up in the middle of Juno's world, and part of her hard life lesson. Garner flashes NONE of her usual annoying perkiness and is actually quite serious and focused on her somewhat unlikeable character. Bateman plays the guy who got forced into playing grown-up and is now looking for a way to escape. Pretty good stuff without going over the top.<br/><br/>Juno's parents are played well by Allison Janney and JK Simmons, and her friend and confidant is played by the up and coming Olivia Thirlby. Thirlby and Page will team up (literally) again in next year's ""Jack and Diana"". Rainn Wilson, from ""The Office"", has a couple of hilarious lines ... also seen in the previews ... but doesn't show up again.<br/><br/>Yes, any film whose soundtrack includes Mott the Hoople and Velvet Underground gets points for coolness. This film has to be put in with the ""small"" films that dedicated film lovers live for, but the masses rarely even hear about. Of course, due to the subject matter, it isn't for everyone ... but it is extremely high level story telling, with terrific acting and direction. One of the year's best for sure."
"mr_walsh","4","3","11","6 July 2008"," Decent acting, but over-hyped
","I enjoyed the performances by all the actors. 'Bleeker' in particular came across as completely authentic. The dialog had its moments, though I didn't understand how a teenager would know about such ancient obscure things like 'Soupy Sales'.<br/><br/>But like 'Lars and the Real Girl' I felt like the movie felt incomplete somehow. Almost in the same vein as 'Dazed and Confused', except that it *unintentionally* was a fairly unexciting recount of a few days in the lives of a few people as they deal with a fairly novel situation.<br/><br/>And I have to say that I can't really enjoy a movie that glorifies people like Juno and 30+ year old teenagers like Mark but belittles responsible 'grown ups' like Vanessa and the abortion protester. I guess movies like this appeal to a society that would like there to be no shame for anything."

"Pavel-8","7","3","11","18 January 2008"," Cute and likable.
","Independent films are an interesting breed. Made outside the mainstream studio structure, the best ones compensate for their lower production value with a better story and characters. Every year an indie or two does captures the collective fascination of critics and the public by doing so. This year's darling is ""Juno"", the name of the newly pregnant teenage girl around whom the simple story revolves.<br/><br/>Like many such films, ""Juno's"" strengths lie in its unique characters. Foremost among them is the titular one, who has a singular vernacular and attitude that carries the movie. As she decides what to do with the child, she must also deal with the various reactions from her family and friends. But rather than become depressed or reclusive, Juno instead chooses a positive approach, dealing with her issues directly and responsibly. This leads to a relatively sunny take on subjects often approached in a dark or politically charged manner. The movie does tell you what to think about issues; it does not argue strongly either way; it just tells you what characters are doing, and gives a little of their rationale, somewhat like Clint Eastwood's phenomenal ""Million Dollar Baby"" a few years back.<br/><br/>On one hand, making light of serious situations like abortion and divorce feels wrong. Conversely, the ability and opportunity to laugh at potentially overbearing situations is a relief, and it is part of what makes us human. While such reactions likely would not be appropriate in reality, movies are not reality, but an escape in which a little levity is more than appropriate.<br/><br/>From the guitar-laced harmonic strains of its soundtrack to the aforementioned quirky characters, ""Juno"" is a quintessential indie flick. Like ""Garden State"", it has a few transcendent glimpses into the human soul, but they are too few and far between to carry the movie to extreme heights. Like ""Little Miss Sunshine"", it places quirky characters into unusual and often comic circumstances, but the humorous moments here do not approach the hilarity of ""Little Miss Sunshine"". Most of the comedy is based upon the unique dialogue or the continual series of culture clashes between Juno and everyone, which are amusing throughout.<br/><br/>Some critics (Roger Ebert) are hailing ""Juno"" as the year's best film, which is a drastic overstatement. Such grand labels are a joke, and a statement on how monotonous comedies have become. Its ipseity amidst the dramatic leanings of most Oscar contenders makes the movie better and more enjoyable than it actually should be. Juno is a cool breeze drifting through an open window, not an eye-popping blast from the air conditioner. It is enjoyable and well-crafted, not the best film of the year, maybe a fringe contender for the top ten.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: The movie is equivalent to its main character: cute and likable, but lacking in a few areas. Recommended primarily for indie fans. 7 of 10."
"amy-wow","10","3","11","14 January 2008"," Gem of a movie
","Juno has been hailed as this year's Little Miss Sunshine, but to be perfectly honest Juno is ten times better than Little Miss Sunshine was. Little Miss Sunshine was funny, and off-the-wall and had a superb supporting cast, but underneath Juno's mouthy exterior lies a beautiful, charming, touching little film with quotable lines galore. It tells the story of Juno MacGuff, a sixteen year old who finds herself in a dilly of a pickle (Juno will have you saying those kinda things) when she discovers she's pregnant. Rather than have an abortion, she opts to put the baby up for adoption. I'm not going to discuss the plot in further detail because I don't want to spoil this gem of a movie for anybody. The film features an all-star cast, with the likes of Ellen Page, Michael Cera, JK Simmons, Allison Janney, the aforementioned Jason Bateman and Jennier Garner, Olivia Thirlby and a brief but glorious cameo from Rainn Wilson. Of course it's the film's lead Ellen Page who shines the most in this shiny little movie, giving an incredible performance as the witty, mouthy, lovable Juno. I hate to think what this movie would have been like had any other actress played the title role. Page captures the essence of Juno perfectly, and turns out a performance that has already earned her SAG and Golden Globe nominations, and surely will get her an Oscar nod, if not win. In Juno, teenage girls are given an alternative heroine, a tiny mouthy pregnant girl as opposed to the typical Hollywood teenage stereotype. The script is one of the most original ones I have ever come across, and minus a couple of cringeworthy lines/references ('Honest to blog!') it is set to become a reference point for anybody in the future sitting down to write an indie type movie. This isn't your typical indie movie, and it's not one that can only be enjoyed by freaky-deaky people who set out to find offbeat flicks. It's one that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, and is most definitely one of th best of the year."

I think the actors, the plot and most of all the DIALOGUE was so brilliantly written and executed impeccably by all of the actors, especially the main character Juno. This young lady nails her performance head-on and her charm,tomboyism, beauty, cleverness and independent spirit definitely captured my attention throughout the entire film and kept me anticipating the next clever remark to come out of her mouth. Towards the end of the film, it was also very refreshing to see that she had her emotional side when she is utterly crushed after learning about the adoptive parents plans to divorce. It also touched me deeply when at the end of the film she sobs her heart out after having given up her baby boy for adoption. I appreciated the all of the film's aspects but I have to honestly say that I especially appreciate the message behind it(well the one I got from it. In my opinion, this movie acknowledges the nationwide, continuing issue of teenage sex and pregnancy, however; it presented the bold choice and option to make the responsible and incredibly mature decision to give the baby up for adoption. I think this option is too often overlooked and not explored enough by pregnant teenagers and their parents. Finally, in the end it showed that a teenager's life should not necessarily be over because they have had a baby."

There are moments that are very sincere (many thanks to Ellen Page). For example, when Juno says ""I don't really know what kind of girl I am."" Here is a character you find so funny, but also can turn on a dime and just make you feel very much for her. Also when Juno leaves the note for Vanessa that says ""If you're still in, I'm still in.""

"StevePulaski","10","2","6","2 May 2011"," Why can't all teen films be as nice as this?
","There is something quirky and special about Juno that I can not put in words that make sense. It's something totally unexpected and a very surprisingly well done teenage film in 2007. It's so rare we see a film done like this recently. But it gives hope that charming and one of a kind teenage films are not dead. They maybe just on hiatus.<br/><br/>Ellen Page plays Juno, an independent girl who tries to take action when she realizes that she is pregnant with her ex-boyfriend's child (Cera). She considers abortion (in a non-biased pro life, pro choice decision) and she becomes more and more frustrated as her options get smaller and as her stomach gets larger.<br/><br/>I love movies that dare to be different. They don't always work, but they at least get a few points for coloring outside of the lines. Juno is a film that colors outside of the lines and it makes a picture. A beautiful picture of a girl who just wants to live and do what she believes is right.<br/><br/>The quirky element of the film is taken a tiny bit too far when Juno feels the need to tell the woman at the Abortion clinic that she ""is talking on her hamburger phone."" Yes, our protagonist communicates on a novelty hamburger shaped phone. I searched through reviews on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes before coming across a review on Netflix with someone stating the same problem they had with the film.<br/><br/>The joke is the film acts natural by including some trinket like a hamburger phone and not noticing it. The fact that Juno had to say she was ""talking on her hamburger phone"" ruins the joke because now the film is trying too hard to get its audience to know the film is different. It didn't need to announce it. We knew it from the start. The film doesn't need to turn self aware all of a sudden.<br/><br/>That minor flaw isn't enough to deduct the film any stars. Juno is perfect. It's a teen film was almost too good. Michael Cera does great at playing his trademark role as a geeky, pushed around dweeb with a big heart. Him and Ellen Page have amazing chemistry that just clicks from the start.<br/><br/>Juno could be called a sleeper hit at the Oscars for only winning Best Original Screenplay by Diablo Cody, respectively. The film was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director (Reitman), and Best Actress (Page). It found itself sort of shoved to the side while films like No Country For Old Men got the fame. Sort of sad, but hopefully it will bounce back.<br/><br/>Of course the film came with quotable catchphrases like ""Woah, dream big!"" ""Honest to blog?"" and ""Shut your gob!"" All uttered by our female lead, Ellen Page. The film introduces us to its character's vocabulary besides telling us a lot about her colorful personality.<br/><br/>Juno is probably the best teen film of the 2000's decade followed by Mean Girls. It is so quirky and lovable it is welcomed as more than a daring experiment, but an unforgettable and touching film in it's category.<br/><br/>Starring: Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jason Bateman, J.K. Simmons, Jennifer Garner, Allison Janney, and Olivia Thirlby. Directed by: Jason Reitman."

","Back in 08, when the movie came out on DVD, there was a huge buzz about it winning best screenplay and, so I decided I should check it out.<br/><br/>The movie is about a 16 year old girl named Juno MacGuff. I'm not kidding. I'm serious. Throughout the movie I tried to pretend that name wasn't the most pretentious female protagonist name I've ever heard but I failed. She talks like a real smartass and acts all cocky to people. She's 16 and is in love with Paulie Bleeker (again, another pretentious ""indie"" name). One day she finds out that she got pregnant from a time when she and Paulie had sex. She considers having an abortion, but after being forced to face the fact that once you make a decision it stays with you forever, she decides to come out about her pregnancy to her parents and give it up for adoption. She finds one family in a classified ad who has an infertile mother and goes to get to know them. She takes a keen kinship to the husband, who loves indie music and cinema, including one situation where they watch the 70s cheese horror flick ""The Wizard of Gore"". Then a bunch of drama and depressing indie pretentiousness ensues and... I... just... don't... freaking... care. The end.<br/><br/>I didn't HATE this film. Some lines were funny and I liked some of the cast, including the guy who played Jameson from Spider Man, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman, who of course charms in each role. One particularly powerful scene was when Juno has an emotional breakdown in the van- Finally she acts instead of trying to be a teenager and spewing cocky words.<br/><br/>To say the characters are cardboard is an understatement- they're TISSUE PAPER THIN. Juno is not likable at all. Why should I sympathize for her? She's just a smartassed cocky borderlining-on-bitch who has absolutely no reason to be in the story other than the fact that she's the protagonist and she's pregnant. And her constant pop culture references were don't help either. Paulie I have no respect for- come on, getting a girl knocked up before she's even old enough to drive has no respectability in it, and the movie tries to make me care about him by making him all ""cute"" and ""awkward"" but come on. Also, this film in a way almost glamorizes teen pregnancy- Their parents are cool with her being pregnant AT 16 (I've known people in this situation and trust me, their parents were the exact opposite of that). There's much more but it would be too long to list. Oh and for the record, I don't think I've EVER heard anyone say ""Pork swords"".<br/><br/>I don't even think creepy looking assassins with stupid haircuts and silenced shotguns could have saved this film. It's not terrible but I honestly don't get why it's so praised."
"Kalle_it","5","2","6","19 April 2010"," Your typical ""oh-so-smart"" indie movie
","Juno suffers from the very typical ""indie movie syndrome"".<br/><br/>Obscure and outdated pop-culture references, over-the-top jargon, smartass and typical characters...<br/><br/>The ""aren't we cool, eh?"" vibe can be felt throughout the whole movie, while the story itself ends up being little more than a platform where to build a mountain of self-referential jokes.<br/><br/>Also I have severe reservations on Juno herself...<br/><br/>The wise-cracking, anti-conformist 16 years old Juno is supposed to be smart to the point of being obnoxiously smart, yet she gets pregnant with the blissful idiocy of your random airhead bimbo.<br/><br/>And here lies my main issue with the movie... Juno isn't a realistic portrait of a teenager. Juno talks and acts in a way which is just not the way a 16 years old would talk and act.<br/><br/>It's quite easy seeing through her and finding her character is a projection of the screenwriter's ideas and thoughts. Also the pop-culture references are out of context and clearly out of Juno's time.<br/><br/>Juno is not a realistic, cool-anti-conformist teenager, she's how the screenwriter thinks a cool and anti-conformist teenager should be.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters are off the same mould. The ditzy friend, the awkward-yet-supportive family, the oblivious boyfriend, the rich-but-unhappy couple..<br/><br/>It's a shame, because the topic and the story itself had potential, but the excess of witty self-complacency killed the movie, basically making it some sort of CollegeHumor project.<br/><br/>Underage pregnancy, abortion, adoption, single parenting and immature adults are topics that deserved a better and more insightful development.<br/><br/>Instead Juno treats her pregnancy as if it was just a severe case of excessive gas... Annoying yes, but a goldmine for jokes and odd situations. Once the burden is disposed of (be it by abortion or adoption) let's just carry on as if nothing ever happened.<br/><br/>A final note, of course she could NOT find a normal family to give her child to... It just had to be an odd couple of a fretful woman and a man-child. A man-child who is into the same things Juno is (shame he was actually ALIVE to remember them, while Juno has apparently spent years on OldFads.com) and the presence of the young girl triggers his midlife crisis.<br/><br/>All in all Juno fails because it's unrealistic, clichÃ© and smug. None of the characters are endearing due to the excess of ""smartassery"".<br/><br/>Passable at best, clearly not worth all the hype.<br/><br/>Also I bet it'll age horribly and in a matter of few years nobody will get the majority of the references"
"Red_Identity","Null","2","6","23 September 2009"," A touching and heartwarming comedy with fantastic writing and performances!
","I admit it, I used to be one of those Juno haters back in 2007 and 2008 when Juno was getting so much praise and awards. It certainly was a good film, but I always thought that it was so overrated. Watching it for the second time now, I can see that is is a really great film. Diablo Cody gets a lot of hate from some people, and while I was used to be one of those, I have to say this- Diablo Cody really knows how to write dialogue. Seeing Juno again, her dialogue reminded me of great dialogue from films like Pulp Fiction. Yes, it is very different, but just as catchy. The dialogue is full of quirks here and there, memorable lines, and while I do see why many people say it is 'too much, I love the film for that now. The character of Juno, while being all of this, is a greatly developed character, played brilliantly by Ellen Page. She is perfect for a role like this, and she was worthy of that Oscar nomination. But the whole cast brings Cody's screenplay to make a film that is truly great. Michael Cera, Allison Janney, J.K. Simmons, Olivia Thirlby, Jason Bateman, and especially Jennifer Ganrer (who in a truly amazing scene between her and Juno's belly, she proves how great of an actress she is, and how subtle she can be) are all amazing and fun to watch. The music of this film is brilliant as well. So I am now a big fan of Juno, and I now think it gets way too much hate. One of the best comedies of this decade!"
"mmunrost","10","2","6","17 January 2009"," Excellent - what more can I say
","First, those viewers who hated this movie are Christian conservative nut-jobs. There are lots of teenagers that get pregnant. Hell, I was shocked to find in Cleveland Ohio, there are nurseries in some high schools because so many of the girls get pregnant. I'm not saying it is right, I'm just saying it is, unfortunately, a fact of life.<br/><br/>What I liked about this movie, is that it is incredibly uplifting. All the characters, even with their flaws, have likable traits. I think the decision Juno made was very brave and the outcome just seemed right.<br/><br/>Juno's character was not flippant and bored - that was her persona. For all of you that pointed out that she had sex because she was bored, note that Bleeker pointed out to her that he knew she was not bored. How could she be when she knew the Blair Witch Project was on TV that night!"

","Juno is a 2007 film directed by Jason Reitman and written by Diablo Cody. The film stars Ellen Page as the titular character, as well as Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, J.K. Simmons, Allison Janney and Jason Bateman. The film premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September, 2007.<br/><br/>The film follows the story of Juno McGuff, a sixteen-year-old girl who discovers she is pregnant to her friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). Juno at first decides to have an abortion, but later changes her mind and decides to put the unborn baby up for adoption. Through an ad in the local newspaper, she finds Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa Loring (Jennifer Garner), a couple wishing to adopt. The film focuses on Juno's relationships with each of the different characters, Mark, Vanessa, her father (J.K. Simmons), her stepmother (Allison Janney), Paulie Bleeker, and her best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby).<br/><br/>The film opens with Juno walking around in a cartoon landscape. This opening scene immediately sets the scene for the quirkiness of the film. Juno's on-and-off boyfriend Bleeker is part of a running team. At various points in the film we see the group of runners running past Juno in exactly the same fashion. This is I believe intended to show the repetitiveness of life, and is showing how Juno's life is different to most other peoples. There are other symbols of this, such as the tic-tacs that Bleeker is always eating. They also represent the repetition in life. There is also the symbol of the chair, which features at the beginning and end of the film, and is presumably meant to tie up the film in a circle, but I felt the chair symbolism was forced and didn't really do anything for me.<br/><br/>I absolutely hated the soundtrack. The songs chosen for the movie are clearly meant to reflect how quirky and off-beat the movie is, so I guess they fit, but it still doesn't stop it from being awful. The soundtrack includes multiple songs written by Kimya Dawson. Dawson was a personal choice from actress Ellen Page.<br/><br/>I didn't really like the film. It was mediocre; very forgettable. Perhaps if I was a pregnant teenage girl this movie would have spoken to me, but I'm not, so it didn't. My major criticism is the screenplay. Juno speaks with the vocabulary of an English professor. Is it meant to be funny? Cool? Smart? Clever? I wasn't entertained by it; it made the movie feel fake. Then at different points in the film, the character of Juno seems to completely reverse, and she uses words like ""Forshizz"", and an over-use of the word ""like"". It tried to contain too many references to typical teenage life, and tried to be funny but wasn't.<br/><br/>I would give this film 6/10."
"Tweekums","10","2","6","9 November 2008"," Ellen Page delivers the goods
","Having enjoyed Ellen Page's performance in Hard Candy I looked forward to seeing this. Once again Ellen's performance was first rate, this time playing a sixteen year old who gets pregnant after having sex with her friend Bleeker (Michael Cera). Her initial reaction to the situation is to seek an abortion but changes her mind when she is unimpressed with the clinic.<br/><br/>Juno realises that she is too young to raise the child so seeks a couple to adopt it. The couple she finds finds seem perfect, she is desperate to have a child and he is a cool guy that Juno relates to as the discuss their tastes in music and horror films. Of course there are some problems along the way but I won't go into details as I'd rather not spoil the film too much.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film yet I'd certainly recommend it, I enjoyed it from start to finish and laughed out loud a few times. The acting is top notch, both from Ellen and from the supporting cast. The dialogue is sharp through out, perhaps a little too sharp for a girl of Juno's age but I don't think that matters as it is delivered believably. I'm not surprised that Ellen Page got an Oscar nomination for this film, I'm sure it is only a matter of time before she wins one."
"tracyfigueira","10","2","6","29 July 2008"," the real deal
","""Juno"" is one of two 2007 movies dealing with unwed pregnancy (""Knocked Up"" was the other) and of the two I liked it much better. Self-appointed media watchdogs are already claiming that it glamorizes teen pregnancy, but personally I think Hollywood does far more harm by glamorizing smoking. If I had a teenage daughter (God forbid!) I'd much rather she become pregnant than take up smoking. Conservative critics should embrace this movie for its pro-life message. ""Juno"" is a genuinely sweet, gentle feel-good movie starring one of the most beautiful and appealing starlets since Audrey Hepburn. I've fallen in love with Ellen Page (and Amy Adams of ""Enchanted."") Michael Cera is likable as her nebbishy boyfriend and Jennifer Garner gives a touching performance as a middle class housewife desperate for a baby and coping with an immature, shallow husband (Jason Bateman) who seems a better match for 16-year old Juno. This is one Hollywood film that does not patronize middle America or working class people. I was disappointed that Juno didn't keep the baby at the end, especially since Garner's character would have to raise it by herself, her good-for-nothing husband having flown the coop. Still, it was a wonderful movie and I hope to see more from Ellen Page."
"reliquiae","10","2","6","20 June 2008"," Loved it!
","I really enjoyed this movie. I loved how ""real"" and earthy it was. People, especially kids talk the way Juno does. I think it was very worthy of the Oscar, and Ellen Page was fantastic! You really can't help but adore the character by the way she plays it. The ending was perfect and it is not a disappointment. I was glad to see that the character ""Juno"" maintained her promise to ""Vanessa"" and gave Vanessa what she so desperately needed. I think the movie depicted what teenagers during this current time really go through. I think the ""awkwardness"" that was conveyed in the entire movie was symbolic of the awkwardness that teenagers really go through. (Especially the ""unpopular"" crowd!) I loved this movie!"

","Juno, written by stripper turned writer Diablo Cody is the story of a 16 year old girl, Juno, played by teen actress Ellen Page, who falls pregnant with her best friend Paulie Bleeker, played by teen actor Michael Cera.<br/><br/>Juno decides to have a quick abortion, but when it comes down to it, she can't bring herself to doing it. With the help of her female best friend Leah, played by teen actress Olivia Thirlby, looks for advertisements for parents in the local newspaper.<br/><br/>When Juno and Leah have been looking for a while, they see a photo and advertisement for a couple called Mark & Vannesa Loring, played by child star turned adult director Jason Bateman and Electra star Jennifer Garner, who have been looking to adopt and failed attempts for pregnancy.<br/><br/>When Juno decides she wishes to give the baby to this couple she decides to go to their home to meet them, with her father by her side, Mac, played by J.K Simmons.<br/><br/>Mark & Vannessa have a friendly and cosy home, with parts looking ultra modern. They live in a gorgeous neighbourhood, a surprise to Juno, who comes from a poor home with small homes.<br/><br/>Juno is convinced she is doing the right thing by allowing these people to adopt her unborn child.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the story is showing how she is adapting to being pregnant with school life and how it has changed her life.<br/><br/>This up-beat, quirky comedy drama is one of the year's best with outstanding performances by Ellen Page, not forgetting Allison Janney who plays her interfering step-mother. The movie won the Best Original Screeplay Oscar, a medal well deserved.<br/><br/>The script is quick witted and is the best teen movie yet. Reason being, it's not patronising to younger people, it speaks the truth. Juno is sweet and kind with a bitchy layer, maybe hard to believe by the description but the opposite to Tina Fey's Mean Girls.<br/><br/>This teen movie has more weight than most, breaks all stereotypes. Teen movies are traditionally about the popular kid in school finding love or going to parties. Juno is enjoyable, funny with plenty of parts young people like Juno will be able to relate to. With the lines Juno says ""Im in a fat suit I can't take off!"".<br/><br/>Juno is a feel good movie which is a must see! The best movie, in my eyes, of 2007.

","Quirky, indie films are seen as reliable alternatives to the generic bubble gum blockbusters, but some of them could go head-to-head with the big boys. ""Juno"", a coming-of-age dramedy (drama meets comedy) is one of those contenders, and it should be proud that it is. Hell, it earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture for 2007. What more do you want?<br/><br/>Spunkiness, sarcasm and maturity are wrapped up in the title player, high school junior Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), who's confronted with being heavy with child, after causal sex with track and field runner and good pal, the turtle-like Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera of ""Superbad"" and ""Arrested Development"").<br/><br/>Abortion seems plausible, but the (inane) notion of a fetus having fingernails gets to our heroine, forcing her to admit a ""mea culpa"" to her parents and have the child put up to for adoption. Childless yuppies, Mark and Vanessa Loring (Emmy-winner Jason Bateman of ""AD"", ""Smoking Aces"" and ""Hancock""; Jennifer Garner of ""Alias"" and ""Catch and Release"") are the possible couple, but Juno realizes that growing up doesn't mean growing up perfectly.<br/><br/>If you imagine subversive comic Jeanane Garofalo in her late teens/early adulthood, and having the brain of Oscar legend Kate Hepburn, you have Ellen Page, who approaches the role like a giddy sharpshooter and earned an Oscar nom for Best Lead Actress. Though he has the personality of a tadpole, Cera's Bleeker is basically unique. Being an individual, only Juno could befriend, let alone copulate with, a person who's so cool, he doesn't even have to try. Bateman and Garner are picture perfect, effective in hiding the deep chasm between them. They contrast with Juno's folks; caring Mac (J.K. Simmons of the Spiderman films and ""The Closer"" and he should have been nominated) and blunt step mom Bren (Allison Janney of ""The West Wing"") are domestically grounded.<br/><br/>Other impressionable players include Rainn Wilson (""The Office"", US version) as a snarky pharmacy clerk; Olivia Thrilby (""Snow Angels"", ""The Wackness"") as Juno's wild-hearted, cheerleader gal pal and mousy Valerie Tian (""Long Life, Happiness and Prosperity"") as an amusingly exploitable pro-life classmate who's the impetus of Juno's change of heart.<br/><br/>But the real star in is the film's scribe, Diablo Cody (nee Brook Busey), an ex-stripper (a lot of material she got!!!) who had fame knocking on her door after she wrote an Internet blog, displaying her sarcastic, non-conformist prose. It shows up in ""Juno"", earning Ms. Cody an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. This is the third time I've seen a movie whose story's so powerful, it reduces the director to a joystick (Taxi Driver and American Gangster are the first two). You could feel sorry for the film's helmsman, Jason Reitman (son of comedy legend Ivan; ""Thank You For Smoking""), but he won't mind. Being Oscar nominated for Best Director is rewarding enough.<br/><br/>If you have animosity for ""Juno"", either because of Ms. Cody's success or the lead character's personality or both, you're wasting time. Like Travis Bickle of ""Driver"" (excluding the Mohawk cut), Juno's a force or nature, cutting through society like a hot knife through butter, and she mirrors her creator's disposition, whose maiden screenplay reminds me of mine own (no details, you thieves). ""I'm sixteen, pregnant and smart! Hear me roar and joke!"" is the film's mantra, and both are monoliths to be reckoned with."

Juno loves music, she is in a band, she studies it (self study at least) and most people I know that listen to music, listen to the history of their favorite genres.<br/><br/>I know clerks in shops that are quick witted. Do you think quickwittedness is limited to just the people who hold jobs that pay 80,000 dollars a year or more?

Do you honestly think all people ALWAYS have protected sex ALL the time? Come on.<br/><br/>I thought her parents were very cool about it.<br/><br/>And I did not find the main character to be RUDE. I think she was honest, and if you really paid attention to the film, she was compassionate, and showed real emotion when watching Jennifer Gerner's character play with the little girl in the mall.<br/><br/>THe scene when she touches and talks to her pregnant stomach, and the two women look at each other was so tender and so real.

","Juno is the story of a teenage girl who becomes pregnant by her milquetoast boyfriend. They go to a quirky high school in a quirky town that is well familiar to anyone who's seen a Sundance movie in the past ten years. Despite the indie movie tropes (e.g., cool, hip parents, even cooler and hipper kids, weak male protagonist, alt rock soundtrack, etc.) Juno does in its second half transcend the familiarity and the irony to achieve something great.<br/><br/>A big reason for this is Ellen Page. Even in the movie's first 15 minutes, when the painfully arch, hipster dialogue (particularly bad is the scene with Rainn Wilson, home skillet!) threatens to drown the movie in a cess pool of snark, Page shines through.<br/><br/>She enlivens Juno and makes her a force of nature. Even though it's hard to believe her as a 16-year old who speaks such a hyper-referential argot and has an encyclopedic knowledge of punk rock bands (most of which became irrelevant or broke up 10+ years before she was born!) Page makes it difficult not to watch her. Indeed, she's a very talented actress who stands in sharp contrast to the glut of Lindsay Lohans and Mandy Moores.<br/><br/>Most of the movie's problems are with the award winning screenplay. Juno's pregnancy is incredibly easy. We see no morning sickness, none of the exhaustion that strikes in the first and third trimesters, the ankle swelling, nothing at all. Juno's glowing the whole movie.<br/><br/>Also things in general happen just a little too easily for litte Juno. Her parents don't even say they're disappointed in her. Her father's bewildered, sad-sack expression doesn't change when she tells him she's pregnant.<br/><br/>There's not a trace of social ostracization in her high school, one of the places where status is the most nakedly and unapologetically pursued. She's even become a little more popular. <br/><br/>And despite Juno's unflappability (which to be fair she does lose in the end) she's still incredibly cavalier when speaking with her friend about getting an abortion. ""Yo, I'm going to the A-Bo clinic and get my womb hoovered.

Kids have sex, kids get pregnant. It's been happening as long as there's been kids and pregnancy. Still, there's nothing much at stake for Juno in this movie. She doesn't have a lot to overcome.<br/><br/>It's also refreshing to see a reaction to unplanned pregnancy different than total devastation, but jeez, does it even bother Juno a little? There's no time in the movie when she alone and pauses for a second to process what's happening? Even her decision in the clinic to not have an abortion is played for goofy laughs. The only anti-abortion protester outside the clinic is an Asian girl mindlessly chanting ""Babies want to be borned.""<br/><br/>The screenplay and director fell a little too much in love with the eponymous Juno and that's the audience's job."
"Natural-Born-Killer","8","2","6","21 February 2008"," A Near Perfect Mix of Poignance and Comedy
","Upon walking into the cinema on Valentine's Day with a bunch of mates (yep, we're all sad), I honestly had no idea what to expect from Juno- one side of me was expecting a wannabe black comedy that, although funny, didn't really do much to inspire the imagination or ask questions. The other side of me was expecting a typical chick flick with a twist that didn't really work- so, all in all, I was dreading it but was also intrigued. As it turns out, both sides of me were wrong.<br/><br/>Juno tells the story of a teenager (conveniently by the name of Juno) who falls pregnant to a boy in her year- Paulie Bleaker- and portrays a 6 month journey from the discovery of the pregnancy, the admission to the family and friends and then what Juno decides to do next- and what she decides to do is become a surrogate for a couple who, it seems, so desperately want a baby- straight away I was hooked. Although basic, the plot was interesting and not so much controversial as relevant to today's society.<br/><br/>Now, it would be very easy for a film with a plot like this to fall apart at the seams and fail miserably after about twenty minutes- but Juno doesn't do this and this is where it excels wonderfully. The way in which the story is told is both subtly humorous and there is a beautiful poignancy to the events that occur. Of course, there are some questionable scenes at the beginning and some of the humour might not appeal to all audiences (whether this is because they don't understand it- which seemed to be the case with some of the people sitting behind us- or because it is directed at a specific demographic I'm not too sure, possibly a mix of the two) but the way in which Juno's story flows and ultimately comes to one of the most beautiful conclusions to a film this decade is quite simply amazing and it very nearly brought a tear to my eye.<br/><br/>This is a film I would definitely recommend to all ages and genders as, even if the humour doesn't quite appeal or if some find the subject matter a little sensitive, there is a little something for everyone in Juno."

","What an excellent movie. As well as Little Miss Sunshine in 2006, Juno is the big independent hit of '07, its funny but it also has its dramatic moments, its also full of irony. With a fresh, original and interesting story about a 16 y.o teen who gets pregnant and from that point, she begins to think what to do with the baby she is expecting. The movie has a very good rhythm that makes it enjoyable. The cast is very good, Ellen Page with a terrific performance as Juno, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Gardner are also very good as the couple that are going to adopt Juno's baby and J.K Simmons with a great supporting role as Juno's father. Director Jason Reitman accomplished a excellent work, he gives us a very natural point of view of a pregnant teenager without being corny. People definitely will loved the soundtrack. Every song sets a mood to each scene to the perfection. This is for sure one of the best movies of the year, a very strong candidate for the upcoming Academy Awards."

","The story was well thought out and Ellen Page played her role perfectly. <br/><br/>While I know there is limited time in any movie it seemed like she chose to get rid of her baby pretty quickly, and Michael Cera's character was pretty quick to agree with her decision (but as for the awkward (boy)friend role he was perfect). <br/><br/>Looking past the hastiness of their decisions I thought it was great Juno saw Jennifer Garner (Vanessa Loring) as a fit mother even though her plan for a complete family fell apart at the last minute. I can't imagine making such a hard decision to get rid of your baby, trying to find the perfect family, finding it, having it ripped out from under you, then making the decision to keep the baby with the future adoptive mother. If only real life worked out so well.<br/><br/>All-in-all a great film, and definitely worth a look. After this film I am definitely looking forward to any other films by any of these actors."

","""Juno"" is the next in an increasingly long line of films about unwanted pregnancy. However, this film has had more of an impact than ""Waitress"" and ""Knocked Up"" and it is curious as to why this should be. Whilst it confronts the issues involved with the subject, it hardly says anything truly affirmative about them. There is however a simple reason for why this film has been more successful than those that have gone before. It is heartwarming, hilarious and, in a phrase, just great.<br/><br/>This is a film based around a number of strong foundations, the first of which is Diablo Cody's script. She creates interesting and detailed characters that are a joy to watch and the dialogue that flies between them is a joy to listen to. The plot is perfectly structured and it is refreshing that the plot doesn't play out as necessarily expected. There is a fantastic sense of reality in this film.<br/><br/>Another strong presence in the film is the cast, lead by the extraordinary Ellen Page. For someone so young to perform moments that are, as her character says, ""way beyond her maturity level"" so effectively is astonishing. She is moving, charismatic and charming: the perfect companion to waltz through the movie with. She is ably supported by Michael Cera who is disarmingly effective as the child's father. However, praise must be handed to Jennifer Garner for her subtle and surprising performance as the potential adoptive mother. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney are also very entertaining as Juno's embattled parents.<br/><br/>The cast are under the direction of the more than capable Jason Reitman who does a really impressive job. His previous effort, ""Thank You For Smoking"", was a flawed comedy, but it showed potential and this film may prove that he is a director rather than a screenwriter. His direction is subtle and inventive and the film is so well crafted that you cannot doubt more than solid direction.<br/><br/>You can't help but be moved and uplifted by this comedy. There is depth in the film that I found quite surprising and wonderfully emotive. This is not a political piece; it is a personal one where the characters are the most important part of the movie. It is sharp, intelligent and, above all, enjoyable. With all of the humour, the emotion and the brilliance, you can't help but leave the film without a smile on your face."
"rubenm","8","2","6","17 February 2008"," Oscar would be well deserved
","What I really liked about this movie is the multi-dimensional approach. Just take the characters. They turn out to be just a little different than you thought they'd be. Juno is a nice girl, but at the same time she's rather heartless. She keeps referring to her baby as 'that thing' and decides against an abortion not because she wants to save her baby's life but because she doesn't like the receptionist at the abortion clinic. Adoptive father Mark at first seems to be the cool guy who likes punk rock and slasher movies, but turns out to be a childish and immature man who'd rather pursue a hopeless career as a would-be rock star than be a responsible father. And Juno's stepmother Bren, who had hoped Juno would be on hard drugs instead of pregnant, later verbally abuses an ultrasound technician who suggests teenage pregnancies are 'poisonous' for babies. The movie doesn't take sides. Not for or against teenage pregnancies, not for or against abortion, not for or against adoption ads in the newspapers. It shows things how they are, and adds a lot of humor and witty dialog. That's refreshing, especially from a country where this kind of thing very often seems to suffer from an one-sided approach. An Oscar for this movie would be well deserved."
"gavin6942","8","2","6","10 February 2008"," An Adult Film For Teens, a Teen Film For Adults
","A teenage girl gets pregnant, and considers her options. After turning down abortion (in an odd scene with Emily Perkins (""Ginger Snaps"")) her decides to give the child up for adoption. Hilarity ensues as we follow her misadventures as well as the relationship of her chosen adopted parents (played perfectly by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). This isn't Kirsten Dunst in ""15 and Pregnant"".<br/><br/>I didn't know how to approach this movie, as I didn't know who the audience was supposed to be. Kids? Adults? It turns out the people who will love this most are fans of ""Dawson's Creek"" and ""Garden State"" most likely, as this film seems to be a blend of those two. The unrealistic (but enjoyable dialog) of Dawson, and the independent spirit of Garden State. And, thankfully, no Zach Braff. Just lots of fun pop culture references spoken by a kid with a grad student's vocabulary. (I really enjoyed the line about Morgan Freeman and the ""Bone Collector"" as well as the Thundercats reference, despite both being technically incorrect.) Surprisingly, it has little or no resemblance to ""Arrested Development"" despite having two of the stars in the picture (though never on screen together).<br/><br/>The music was a strong point of the film, with the focus being Kimya Dawson and the Moldy Peaches. I'm not a big Kimya Dawson fan (my experience with her comes through a friend I can no longer call a friend), but this film sold me. The friend I watched it with was still pondering the next day whether Kimya is a genius or, to tone tone her language, a bunch of rubbish. I was leaning more towards a free spirit doing what she wants, not genius or rubbish, and I think that fits the main character in Juno, who is one of the most unique girls you'll meet.<br/><br/>The best subplot for me was the relationship between Juno and Mark (Jason Bateman), which teeters between father-daughter and near-lovers. I really love how they worked music discussions into the film (Sonic Youth?) and the horror conversation -- what other film talks about Dario Argento and features ""Wizard of Gore""? Not sure about anyone else, but it hit home for me. That's the difference between a good and great movie, the power to resonate.<br/><br/>As stated, fans of ""Dawson"" or ""Garden"" ought to see this. I think most people will like it (my mother did) but this group will like it best. The lead actress (Ellen Page, Kitty Pryde from the ""X-Men"" franchise) is going places (and I don't just mean starring in the new Sam Raimi horror flick)."

","Juno (named after a jealous Roman goddess of heaven and earth) is 16 and pregnant. She had a one-off thing with Paulie Bleeker, a similarly geeky type in golden running shorts. After being frightened off the abortion clinic by a tactless receptionist and placard-waving fellow-student, Juno opts for adoption. ""Can't we just kick it old school?,"" she says, interviewing rather posh prospective parents. ""I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds."" What sets the film apart is its intense performance by the lead star and a sparklingly offbeat and witty script. Juno is one of those teenagers who is thinking faster than everyone around her and extremely articulate. Like her heating-and-ventilation father, we hesitate before thinking we could know better.<br/><br/>In mythology, Juno's deepest desire was for a happy union and proactive partnership. Our heroine having sought out the perfect couple is distraught when, surprise, surprise, they're not perfect. Her father might be on his second marriage, but he is devoted to her in a solid and sincere, role-model sort of way. Their humble, apparently dysfunctional family, is a more solid unit than the high-flying childless materialists who seem to lack for nothing (except a baby).<br/><br/>Our film, with 'Indie' written all over its sleeve, has quirks like hand-scrawled chapters announcing the seasons (the Roman Juno was mistress of them). Juno and her best-friend/inseminator play folksy guitar and listen to suitably recondite pop music. She affects a Sherlock Holmes pipe. We have frequent reminders of its low-budget status - as if we should congratulate it on its miraculous existence. But skillful delivery rescues it from pretentiousness every time. And the heady momentum is kept up to the end.<br/><br/>If acting and script save it from being high school cheese, they also save it from being a pro-life drum-banger. While hitting all the right notes to show that intelligent kids value abstinence and babies over promiscuity and termination, it is simply telling a story and telling it well. There are many excellent films demonstrating the need to allow choice the other way, and both types should rise or fall on their merits as films rather than the examples they extol.<br/><br/>The visual palette of Juno is seductive, rich tones reflecting each season. Cinematography also includes beautiful touches: as Juno sits at the edge of the road, crying for a moment in her car, a slow freight train passes her by. She must do something with her life (and the life inside her), before it, too, passes her by. The story allows all her decisions, of course, to turn out spot on.<br/><br/>We are constantly entranced to see what Juno will do or say next. As a standout film, it has the surprise and freshness of a Little Miss Sunshine. The soundtrack is full of whimsical pseudo-intellectual tracks by little-known bands, oozing the appeal of, say, Garden State.<br/><br/>One might cavil that such a bright, educated and quick-witted young woman is hardly likely to have bypassed condom use in her underage adventure. Or that the ending is unbelievably pat. But this is still probably the cleverest, funniest, and most lovable bittersweet ode to teenage pregnancy you will ever witness."

","I love ""Juno."" It's the kind of movie you want to take home with you.<br/><br/>That kind of magic is generated through several factors, the first being its actors. Ellen Page is a superstar; this film confirms it. She lives and breathes Juno so effortlessly it doesn't seem like acting. Ditto Michael Cera, whose beautifully-timed sense of humor is matched only by his beautifully-rendered sense of human truth. Jason Bateman is given a richer character than he's ever been allowed to play...and he's brilliant as usual. Jennifer Garner has never been better. Alison Janney and J.K. Simmons tackle the richest roles they've filled in years. This film is an acting showcase of the highest order.<br/><br/>""Juno"" is also an example of film-making perfection. For this perfection, two people are responsible. The first is director Jason Reitman, whose previous film was ""Thank You for Smoking."" If that film was an assured debut, then ""Juno"" is a fulfillment of destiny. Every moment of every scene in ""Juno"" flows with the assurance of a director who understands the material as if he wrote it word-for-word (he didn't). There is never a false step...not visually, not emotionally.<br/><br/>The second person responsible for ""Juno"" is its writer--it's mother, if you will--Diablo Cody. A more staggering screen writing debut has not taken place in recent memory. Cody writes in a style and a tone uniquely her own--Hollywood has a new, vibrant, brilliant voice. Her words breathe sweet, wonderful life to the world of ""Juno,"" and she understands the beats of human emotion and the complexities of character in a way that is equal parts completely sensible and utterly surprising. ""Juno,"" in its offbeat, deliberately verbose, stubbornly renegade way, is the most beautifully and delicately written film of the year. And after Ellen Page, Diablo Cody is the film's second breakout superstar.<br/><br/>I want to hug this movie.<br/><br/>(Junoverse ID#2428)"

Of course, this wasn't the cast's fault, it was writers'. In fact, the cast were pretty good, especially Ellen. But when the characters are one-dimensional and not very well developed outcome will be garbage, like in this movie right here. Ellen's character not only one-dimensional, but also was too cringy to watch, you literally hate the main character. She's supposed to be 16 but isn't. We should've seen more of the relationship between characters, but instead, we get pointless dialogs and wasted scenes.

","It seems Hollywood (and now Vancouver) have re-discovered just how funny pregnancy is. Fortunately, this little film isn't too knocked-up with a load of typical maternity jokes. The ones used here are often slapstick, slang or self-effacing. The slang (very inventive metaphors mostly) like much movie dialog is played as though everyday people are suddenly witty beyond reality. That's not to say the lines aren't funny or endearing. I just feel it should've been taken back a few inches around the girth. I also noticed the lack of score composition. Most of the music used in this was light, indie song fare. Quite the contrast to a 'quad-messter' representation here of 4 seasons, post- & gestation. The actual message that I just now can see (a few hours after screening) contained in this for me? You can lose your virginity & look adulthood in the face yet be able to retain innocence. It was almost as refreshing as Disneyland's 'It's a Small World After All' ride. Let me qualify this: I never was one to desire today's typical hi-tech amusement holes. All flash, noise and little substance (like Hollywood). Isn't Disney similar to cinema, after slipping it a Mickey? Seriously, the ride I love is Swiss watch type nostalgia. That's also what feels so good about this movie. Juno shows a world pregnant with trouble. But instead of shoving a typical delivery out of it's pouch, it coats the harsh with a Tic-Tac flavoring.<br/><br/>More importantly, there's a Page being written for Oscar at the awards.<br/><br/>P.S: I'm a long time IMDb user.

","Juno is about a teenage girl, Juno MacGuff, which gets pregnant after only one time with her friend Paulie Bleeker. Then Juno has to tell her father, Mac and stepmom Bren who are not exactly thrilled about the whole thing. Juno decides that the best thing she can do is put the baby up for adoption. She finds a couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring to be the adoptive parents. Throughout the movie the theme of loving the ones that you have around you. That theme is showed in the fact that Juno's family loves her throughout the whole pregnancy. The dad and stepmom do what they can for her and don't get mad and want to disown her for her mistake. Juno does not know how she feels about her love toward Bleeker. The Loring couple who at first appear to love each other end up separated in the end. Their story shows that love is not always forever. The other aspects of the movie are of Juno trying to still fit in at school while she seems to be becoming an outcast. Bleeker wants to be with Juno and try to do what is right but is afraid to because of how the others at school may feel. Juno also does not seem to want him around. Love is complicated at any age, especially when one is a teenager. It is even more complicated when a teenager is pregnant. As in the case of the Lorings, they show that adults have trouble with the concept of love. Lighting themes in the movie is apparent throughout. One scene that shows an example of how lighting is used is after she finds out that she is pregnant. She walks home in the dark, representing the way she may have felt after finding out the news. The lighting is appropriate in other aspects also. Since the movie takes place over the length of a pregnancy the season changes. The winter scenes are filmed with the darkened winter skies and snow on the ground. Motif in the movie reveals another important aspect of a teenager's life. That is that everyone needs a good friend or two in their life to have around to be there for them. Also the movie shows that teenagers can make the right decisions, even if they have made bad ones in the past. Another movie that has one character that loves another but the other one is not sure they feel the same way is The Holiday. The characters are falling in love with each other but realize it at different times. Juno doesn't realize she loves Bleeker for a while and the two couple in The Holiday realizes it eventually. Love can happen at the most unexpected time with the most unexpected person. If you find that love you should keep it as long as possible. As we have seen love is not a guarantee."

Juno decides she needs to find a family for her unborn child. She gets lucky to find a nice couple, Mark and Vanessa, who seem interested in giving her baby a good life. Through her troubles and the couples troubles Juno stays good to her word that she will give them her baby.<br/><br/>This film is a serious film, but is also a comedy, drama and a romance. Although teen pregnancy is not funny this movie some how seems to add some humorous parts to lighten the mood. This film demonstrates real life issues and what the options really are. It also show how easy one can get pregnant (Juno got pregnant her first time) and how hard dealing with it can be. I find this movie to be semi educational as well. It has a lot of valid points and multiple serious matters.<br/><br/>This movie sort of reminds of the 2001 film, Sugar and Spice. I think both films show young teen girl in a similar situation trying to make things work and to do the best they can, whether it is putting the child up for adoption or resorting to crime. Although both films have a completely different story I think they can be slightly related.<br/><br/>The sound was good in this film. I think Bleeker and Juno singing in the end was a perfect choice for sounds. Throughout the whole movie they had good sounds and background music. I think the singing at the end of the movie helped show the romance and the fact that Juno and Bleeker are just kids. The lighting was also good in this movie. It allowed a bright vibrant imagine that was clear and you were focused on the main points of the film. The editing and transitions were clear in this movie. The transitions allowed me to stay focused on what was happened and to continue to say interested in Juno's pregnancy problems.<br/><br/>This film was an enjoy and easy to watch, as well as educational. I think the story Juno was good and all the troubles she went through as she tried to do the right thing for her baby. Although there were many obstacles in Juno's path she made the right decisions and keeps her word.<br/><br/>This will make you laugh, cry and feel for this young girl.

","Juno Directed by Jason Reitman<br/><br/>I was never a fan of Jason Reitman. Thank You For Smoking didn't catch my attention and Up in the Air seemed overrated. I decided to shop for DVD's one day and I saw another one of his movies, Juno. It had Michael Cera and since I love Superbad, I had to see another one of Cera's movies. Ellen Page is also here and she was in the worst X-Men movie ever (X-Men 3) but she did a pretty decent job there. Right now, after watching this movie, I want to see Thank You For Smoking and since Up in the Air was nominated for some Oscars, it looks like a must-see. I won't go as far as to call this film a masterpiece but it exceeded my expectations which were pretty low. Anyway, on to the main review. ---------------------------------------------------------SPOILER LINE---------------------------------------------------- Our main character is Juno MacGuff. She is a 16-year old girl. The catch is, she's pregnant. This film is about teen pregnancy so I can't really relate to this. I don't know any teens that are pregnant but Juno does talk a bit too mature for her age. I didn't talk to a lot of 16-year-olds but it's pretty obvious that they wouldn't talk like this. But all movies require a sense of disbelief and hey, she's pregnant, I don't know how anyone will act in that situation outside the context of this movie. But Juno proves to be a good character because she is likable. You care for her character. There is no villain in this film since it is more of an internal conflict than external so let's move on. The supporting cast consists of Paulie Bleeker played by Michael Cera. Another thing I didn't like about this film was the lack of Michael Cera. He was awesome in Superbad but he was lacking here. I could totally relate with his orange Tic-Tac problem but he's not relatable in any other way for me. Paulie is likable enough though so no harm done. J.K. SImmons plays Juno's father and doesn't stand out very well. Vanessa Loring is pretty likable and Mark Loring is very likable until the near end of the movie. The supporting cast is mostly meh. Only Mark and Paulie stood out. The story of the movie is really good actually. Jason Reitman usually uses some sensitive material as the subject matter for his movies. Thank You For Smoking is obviously about the danger of cigarettes and Up In The Air is about economic downturn. He can really write a good story out of these topics and Juno is no exception. The acting in this film is great. Putting aside everything else, Page, Cera, Bateman, Simmons, and Garner do terrific jobs. The direction is just amazing. I love those types of movies with subtle gimmicks. I hate gimmicks usually but if you're going to put rules to surviving a zombie apocalypse on screen or split the screen into two showing expectations vs. reality, then the movie will tend to be memorable. Juno is very memorable because Reitman does this. His opening sequence is genius and his choice of music is wonderful. The Visuals in this film are great. They really depict what it's supposed to depict accurately. The opening title sequence is also pleasant to watch. Now for the genre, this movie is a Comedy / Drama. The comedy in this film is very subtle and not laugh out loud like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Jason Reitman IS after all the son of Ghostbusters Director Ivan Reitman and Ghostbusters didn't make me laugh out loud either. They made me chuckle, smile, and laugh softly but they focus on the other genres. Ghostbusters focused on the ghosts and Bill Murray's awesomeness, Juno focused on the Drama, Characters, and the Atmosphere. Now this is one of my mini reviews that I don't really take seriously because there's not much I can say about Juno aside from what I have already said. Overall, I give Juno, a 79% awesome."
"dooglesdead","8","1","2","29 March 2010"," Really fresh, competent and enjoyable approach to a sensitive subject
","I was reluctant to watch this movie on the basis of some of the reviews given, and I was also reluctant to review it. However I feel that it deserves a balanced review given the mixed opinions that are currently being represented.<br/><br/>'Juno' is a unique film in many respects, but has a feel similar to that of Jason Reitman's previous work, 'Thankyou For Smoking'. This is in no way a bad thing. The movie started of as a quirky (and to me somewhat irritating) indie teen comedy, but I saw it through and discovered it to be a story of profound meaning. The subject matter alone is a brave one, and I felt that a look at the moral issue of abortion and adoption through the eyes of a teenager was a breath of fresh air in an industry that hasn't approached the subject much at all. Juno's character is the centre-point for the film's development and though she started off (as many reviews have focused on) as a human hub of teenage consumerist representation, after the initial 20 minutes you become increasingly drawn into her situation. My experience of this movie was all in all a very good one. I felt emotionally involved, and was forced to confront Juno's situation in my own mind- considering how she and the other characters must feel given a situation of unrivaled complexity. <br/><br/>I'm not surprised that this film has been met with such mixed opinions, because Reitman is a director who likes to take comedic approaches to fresh and unbroached subjects. But this is to his credit because like 'Thankyou For Smoking', 'Juno' is a heartfelt, sensitive, yet somehow light-hearted look at an issue that we've all had to think about. Ignore the reviews that only focus on the quirkiness of the first 20 minutes and you'll appreciate a movie that is undoubtedly deserving of its Oscar."
"freemantle_uk","8","1","2","16 February 2010"," Teenage Pregnancy Comedy, who would have though it.
","At the end of 2007 and beginning of 2008 Juno was small indie film that took the world by surprise, winning recognition for it's star Ellen Page and made it's first time writer Diablo Cody into one of the best known screenwriters in the world.<br/><br/>In a typical town in Middle America 16-year-old Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) discovers she is pregnant after loosing her virginity with her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). Juno at first tries to have an abortion, but ends up bottling it. With her friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby), she looks for a couple to adopt the baby in the local free paper. After an initially shocked reaction from her dad and step-mum (J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney), they support Juno's decision, and meet the couple. The married couple are Mark and Vanessa (Jason Bateman and the lovely Jennifer Garner), a wealthy upper-middle class who can't have children. Both things become more complex when Juno sees Mark as a kindred spirit, with similar tastes and interests. Juno goes to see Mark, despite the counsel of family and friends.<br/><br/>Juno has talent in front of and behind the camera. They is a excellent support cast, J.K. Simmons, Jason Bateman, Allison 'C.J. Cregg' Janney and Jennifer Garner are all actors I am willing to watch, and offer heart-warming, convincing performances. Ellen Page is the start of the the film, and this is her best role to date. However her character is at times slightly annoying, and I am properly in a minority, but I find Ellen Page is an overrated actress. Michael Cera also offers a heartwarming, down-to-Earth performance as Bleeker, Juno's conflicted friend who is thrown into an extraordinary situation.<br/><br/>Diablo Cody does write a very witty script, with good lines and dialogue, keeping the humour to be very natural and down-to-Earth. The revolves around clever characters and their understanding of the world. She is also able to add drama and develops a decent story. It is a shame that it seems Cody is torching her own career after writing Jennifer's Body.<br/><br/>Jason Reitman is a director with his star rising, having also directed Thank you for Smoking and Up in the Air. With Juno he earned his first Oscar nomination, but understand lost to the Coen Brothers, and had strong competition from Paul Thomas Anderson. Reitman keeps the tone sweet natured and down-to-Earth, allowing the film to organically evolve and for characters to grow. It's not just film about teenage pregnancy but also a coming-of-age story and almost a love story. Reitman has a real spirit and style for this type of material.<br/><br/>I can also praise both Cody and Reitman for showing a more realist view of school life. It's not like other American media like Glee or American Pie or whatever else where either the jocks and the geeks are in the middle of a continuous war or they all the students are just drugged and sex crazed. They are just normal teenagers trying to get by with their school work and want to lead normal lives. The best example of this is Michael Cera.<br/><br/>There are however a few little problems. I thought that Juno as a character was a bit annoying and obnoxious, and is at first hard to sympathise with. I also didn't believe that even as alternative Juno is, her tastes are still to specific and I think at her age she would be listening to bands like the Clash and the Sex Pistol as a way in to listening to other lesser known bands. Finally some of the dialogue is still a bit too scripted, especially for the type film it wanted to be.<br/><br/>This is a good, sweet natured, light comedy, a good film if you like indie films, and films like Little Miss Sunshine."
"prtarver","9","1","2","9 February 2010"," Just watched it, what's with all the bad reviews?
","So I finally just saw ""Juno"" and I jumped on the ol' IMDb to check out the info, and I was bummed out by all the bad reviews! I get it, there were some cheese ball moments, hence the 9 out of 10, but come on people, it was a feel good movie! It was supposed to make you happy and smile and have a good time, and it did that well with out being overly sappy and lame. If you want an edgy disturbing art house coming of age movie, go watch ""Requiem for a Dream"" or something. Anyways, I thought it was a really good movie that made me smile and feel all warm and fuzzy inside. That's nice sometimes. Now I'm going to go watch ""American Psycho"" to bring myself back to earth."
"mirwais-orbit","8","1","2","21 September 2008"," Not all that I was expecting, but...
","I was quite curious about this movie. Any comments of it till now are very positive and the fact that the screenplay was written by a blogger and former stripper, only increased my curiosity. But just yesterday I had the opportunity to watch it.<br/><br/>Movies are like books. There isn't bad literature coz everything is valid. And I think the same thing about movies. I'm a person who watch any kind of movie, and I try hard to understand the primary artistic tone of each one of them, even if it's the worst movie ever. I do this because regardless the quality of the film, sometimes the intentions are good. Of course there are unbearable films, but the idea, if well crafted, could offer an excellent result.<br/><br/>I really must say that the movie is not all that I expected. I watched the movie and all its extras with pretty attention trying to understand the whole creative process and its intentions at its best, and truly I could not understand the reason for so much talk about.<br/><br/>It is a smart movie, no doubt. It's a realistic drama, the existence of clichés are minimal to not being noticeable. And the performances, with no exceptions, are outstanding and convincing. I read and heard few people talking about the performance of Jennifer Garner, but I think that the simplicity and subtlety of her role is very important for the dramatic tone of the film, it's evident especially in the scene where she feels the baby for the first time at the mall, is one of those scenes that any soundtrack is dismissed because it's exciting for its own, and that scene actually is a plus in her entire career. Ellen Page for me is Juno, and Juno is Ellen Page. I cannot imagine any other actress for the role, but like Brazilian reviewer Rubens Edwald told, who watched Hard Candy will realize that Ellen's acting is not very different between both characters, and I totally agree with him.<br/><br/>Nor do I say if the original script (which was written by Diablo Cody) deserved an Oscar. Maybe yes, because Diablo's idea for writing a story that has not yet been told and also with clichés away, really works. I also believe that the power of the characters and the script really works for the fact that much of it was written by Diablo's own experiences. The characters are fictional, but were based on real people and events of writer's own life. With exception of a few characters, all seem to have come from the same cake tin. They are intelligent, cunning and quick-reasonings, and all are references to Diablo's personality. Even the actors say it in the extras, saying that there's a bit of Diablo in each character. That's why they seem so similar to each other and I don't think this is very interesting when we are talking about a screenplay because the great dramatic content of a story is exactly for the existence of distinct personalities created by one person - the screenwriter. I think this is the big negative point of the movie, the personality of the characters are not as deep as it seems, because everyone has a personality very similar to each other and all of them are very similar to Diablo.<br/><br/>Maybe I really don't understood the movie as it should be, or maybe my teenage time has really been quite different, because I couldn't find in the film all the elements that much of the audience could find and talk so much. I also believe that the film was a lot surreal when the parents accepted the pregnancy of Juno in a so easygoing way, mainly, when she decided to deliver her child for adoption as simple as it happened.<br/><br/>Do not judge me bad for some of my bad reviews. It's just that, in my particularly point of view, I don't feel that the film is a masterpiece as it is reported. But even then, I found the movie interesting for being subtle, light, with excellent performances, intelligent dialogs (much more intelligent than in real life), an efficient direction and a script that, although some daydreams, is quite fluid.<br/><br/>It's not all that I was expecting, but also there's nothing so bad or negative to talk about it."
"citizenchris","Null","1","2","14 August 2008"," Cute...but little more
","Juno 8-14-08 Here we have a rather mediocre film in just about every respect except for its extremely witty dialog. I mean seriously folks its a film about a girl getting pregnant. Maybe I'm just too much of a guy to get why this makes for a wonderful movie premise. Watching Juno I laughed from time to time at Ellen Page and her (sometimes too) clever dialog. Here is a young actress who is quite remarkable in her delivery...razor sharp in fact. She is to be admired even if the film she is starring in isn't. Once the credits rolled I couldn't help but feel that the preceding had been the best bits of films I had already seen and that ultimately it didn't bring enough new ideas to the table. Cute...but little more."
"FlorisV","5","3","12","15 June 2008"," Highly praised and best avoided
","This is one of those comedies that will make the viewer check the IMDb or the label of the rental DVD again, asking: ""this is a comedy?"".<br/><br/>While it is clear the film is trying to be funny, through constructed teen dialogues with intended ""cleverness"" and cheap sarcasm, it never really raises a good laugh. Definitely not the actors fault, it was just lacking a sincerely funny script.<br/><br/>If you really want to watch a valuable and funny film featuring a sarcastic teenage girl, watch Ghost World.<br/><br/>There is very little conflict and tempo in this film. It's entire plot line: ""OMG I'm pregnant, what now?"" Personally I have a policy that if a film still bores me after half an hour, i stop viewing it. I did in this case and was glad to read that it would have been a waste of time sitting it through because nothing would have happened in it anyway.<br/><br/>Still a 5 out of 10 because it partially seems a matter of taste and I suspect some (I guess girls) will like the film. The only reason it got an Oscar was that it had an only slightly fresh style in the first 5 minutes with some animations which hardly defined the movie. I would not be surprised if Oscar committee members never watch more than the first 5 minutes. It would explain most of the Oscar handouts a lot better than detailed analyses of why Oscar winning movies suck so much for watchers who actually sit them through.<br/><br/>We'll probably see more of Ellen Page but this was hardly a challenging film for her to do, you're better off watching Hard Candy."
"annillabean16","9","3","12","12 January 2008"," this makes me smile
","oh goodness. i just got home from the theater where i saw Juno with one of my friends. It was all i expected it to be, and it was so cute! Definitely a cult classic in the making. The casting was perfect, as it nearly always seems to be with movies; Ellen Page especially did just a stupendous job with her role; I don't think there's another actress out there that could have out-acted her. (It doesn't hurt that Ellen Page looks super-cute with Michael Cera!) I don't really have much else to say other than it is a worthy viewing. Annilla Beans Friend Liza says: I agree. It was a very cute film, and will become a classic in a very short time. It's one of those movies that you can go back and watch again and not be bored. Plus, it had a very trippy (the cool kind not the weird kind) soundtrack, the music was perfectly suited to the movie."
"TOMNEL","9","3","12","12 January 2008"," Funny, sweet, touching......excellent movie.
","Last year's ""Knocked Up"" was thought of by many as a hilarious look at the unintentionally pregnant woman. Juno beats that movie in every way. It's funnier, it's sweeter and has more emotion. Obviously these two weren't meant to be compared, but it deserves a small comparison, in which Juno wins hands down.<br/><br/>Juno (Ellen Page) finds out she's pregnant, and knows right away she wants to give the baby to a nice home. She finds seemingly perfect couple Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) to give the child to. Juno also has trouble with her baby's father, and her father and step-mother. The way this movie is done is very unique. The humor comes from the witty choice of words, and not so much from the jokes themselves. The drama, like the humor, is somewhat subtle at times, but it's obviously there, and is one aspect that made this a great movie. The switches from comedy to drama were smooth. The plot was good, as were the characters. Many of the characters had similar ways of speaking making it sound like they were the same character, but it really wasn't bothersome at all.<br/><br/>I highly recommend you check this one out. There's not much to dislike about it, but there is quite a lot to love.<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins. PG-13 for sexual humor and language."
"atandt","8","3","12","11 January 2008"," a lot of fun! pretentious? non!
","'Juno' is an unusual film that really carries you along with it.<br/><br/>the dialogue is the first thing that hits you, quickly followed by crackling & quirky characters. even the setting is vivid & purposeful and evokes realism. (although i wasn't so sure why Paulie had the hebrew alphabet thing on the back of his door).<br/><br/>clearly filmed in Canada (i mean, not only was there a metric 2.8L jug of SunnyD, but it filmed on the container's French side, hence the comma instead of the period). HAHA! i think this just adds to its charm! <br/><br/>i could think of worse films which take themselves way too seriously... 'Juno' doesn't suffer from being too twee. i found the offbeat, upbeat nature of the main character, & the slightly surreal interactions of all the characters made for a jolly tableau.<br/><br/>sometimes people *really are* that witty in real life (i know i am ;-) so i felt that Juno's snappy deliveries (even when she doesn't get it right) were consistent with a teen who is either masking her (relative) 'immaturity' or is exhibiting her brightness & uniqueness... either way, it worked for me! <br/><br/>'Juno' is funny, irreverent, comic, & even densitive, yet without the schmaltz. feelin' sorry for the haters right about now, as whatever they were expecting or had brought to the screening with them thwarted their enjoyment of something uncommon."
"craig-mustoe","10","3","12","10 January 2008"," Great movie!
","I thoroughly enjoyed this off-beat movie. I may, however, have had a somewhat unique experience. Somewhere in the middle of the showing we began to see the microphone in the top of the frame. It continued to happen off and on throughout the movie. We weren't sure at first if it was a part of the humor or not. We finally decided that the idiots at the theater had the framing all messed up, but some of the effects were quite hilarious! I intend to go back and see it again sans ""special effects,"" though I may never be able to keep a giggle down during some serious scenes where I recall seeing the whole boom in the scene. Kind of ruins the suspension of disbelief thing. Juno has to be one of my all-time favorite characters. It would be fun to watch ""Pretty in Pink"" right after seeing this--how much has changed and how much has stayed the same in the intervening years? This movie had a lot of the feel of ""Napoleon Dynamite."" That is, the characters are quite real, not cheesy teen stereotypes. You know these kids and parents. Great, authentic, realistic film."
"thatsaboutright","Null","3","12","9 January 2008"," Juno
","Juno has become ONE of my favorite movies of ALL TIME! I type this as I listen to the soundtrack I just bought today.<br/><br/>I was once asked, if I felt there were any perfect movies. I have often wondered about that. I am not sure I can say yes with complete confidence. But in the case of Juno, as I see it, I can say YES! To me, Juno is a PERFECT movie.<br/><br/>It began well, played well, ended well.<br/><br/>Like Superbad, the opening credit sequence does well to open the stage of what to expect from this movie. It also lets you know quickly that you are about to watch something original and outside the norm. The first 10 minutes contains some of the best banter I have ever heard on film.<br/><br/>Juno is quick witted and smart with out being pretentious. You may think, going in, that you are going to see a movie about teen pregnancy. Even though there are some educational moments, they are directed at Juno, so they don't come off as preachy. These moments serve to tell the story. Not to present a Pro Life agenda. Even though I feel this movie is more about change and relationships than about teen pregnancy. The complexity of being together.<br/><br/>There is not one performance that isn't fantastically delivered! In my opinion Jason Reitman has surpassed his father, Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters fame, as a director. Of course Reitman junior doesn't have the long track record of his father. But I cannot recall anything that Reitman senior has done that was this simple and complex all at once. I say this being a big Ivan Reitman fan.<br/><br/>I am afraid to give away too much in this review because, even though you may know where this movie is going, the journey is what you will enjoy.<br/><br/>Ellen Page gives a performance that COULD NOT have been delivered any better. In Juno, she creates a character you want to hang out with. Making the film feel like lunch with a friend rather than a two dimensional projection on canvas.<br/><br/>There were many times I almost squirted tears of laughter, sorrow, and joy. At the end I did loose it. But being with a friend and being a MACHO DUDE, I quickly wiped those tears away.<br/><br/>In the booklet that comes with the Juno soundtrack, Ellen Page's contribution to the film is proved to be more than just in her fantastic performance. Jason Reitman states that two months before shooting, he asked Ellen what music she thought Juno listened to. Her response was The Moldy Peaches. They sing the song 'Anyone Else But You'. The same song sang by Ellen Page and Michael Cera at the end of the film. So in my opinion, Ellen Page not only carries the film through her performance, but she also becomes it soul. The unseen element that cannot be written.<br/><br/>Incidentally. The last shot of the film was actually the last day of shooting for Juno. With mics hidden in bushes, Ellen Page and Michael Cera perform 'Anyone Else But You', while the crew cry from behind the cameras. It was at that point they realized, the shoot was over and this was the end of their family.<br/><br/>Please don't take any of this to mean you are going to see a sap fest.<br/><br/>Juno is NOT a chick flick.<br/><br/>When it is released on DVD, it belongs on the shelf with ANY of your Seth Rogen Kevin Smith Judd Apatow DVDs.<br/><br/>Make a new friend. GO SEE JUNO!"

","It is rare when a movie stays with me for longer than a week. However, in the case of Juno, almost two weeks later, it's the only movie I care to see or even discuss.<br/><br/>First, Ellen Page may very well be one of the greatest young actresses today. Her award buzz is greatly warranted with her star-making turn as the title character. I'll be surprised if she doesn't win the Golden Globe, and earn an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Secondly, the screenplay written by Diablo Cody is award worthy. The dialog is real, witty, and fun. I'll also be surprised if she does not win the Globe, and I feel she'll win the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie itself is feel-good. I think it will win the Globe for Best Picture-Comedy or Musical, and most certainly will be nominated by the Academy for Best Picture, if not win.<br/><br/>As I previously stated, it's rare when a movie affects with me this greatly. Not only has it become my number 1 movie of 2007, it has become number 1 on my all-time list."
"phillipps79","10","3","12","29 December 2007"," a memorable piece of cinema
","I've come to expect good things from Fox Searchlight, but this was remarkable even for them. This film will leave you with a good feeling despite its involvement with sobering subject matter. There is no situational comedy in the film, but the dialogue is witty enough to catch a seasoned moviegoer off-guard. You will find yourself laughing involuntarily as the mundane line you expected turns into something quite eccentric. The writing lightens what would otherwise be a very depressing movie--a difficult task. Ellen Page and J.K. Simmons steal the show with masterful,emotional, timeless performances. Ears perked in the theater when there was interaction between these two powerhouse actors. Page leads you through her struggles in the way only a gifted actor could. Michael Cera delivers his unique style perfectly. Cinematography of fall colors is as dark and beautiful as a painting in motion and suggests, ""this is the good stuff, memories are made here."""
"Matt_Layden","8","3","12","28 December 2007"," Jason Reitman scores with another comedy - one of the year's best.
","Juno is a 16 year old girl who one day discovers she is pregnant. First she wants an abortion, but then soon realizes she would rather have the baby and give it to a family in need of one.<br/><br/>When Thank You For Smoking came out it was the biggest surprise of the year. A dark comedy that wasn't afraid to give it straight. Confident directing lead a strong cast. This year, Jason Reitman is at it again with Juno, a heart-warming comedy that...again, tells it like it is. This time we follow a young girl, played strongly by Ellen Page as she faces the world with a bun in the oven. Juno is not your typical teenage girl, she can't even classify herself in one niche. Page brings a heart-warming and grounded performance that comes off as strong, yet vulnerable at the same time. She is supported by Michael Cera, her goofy best friend, who is also the father of her baby. Cera again plays the character of George Michael. We also saw this same character in Superbad earlier this year. It's not a bad thing, Cera has the awkward comedy timing down pat, but he needs to break out of that character and move on to bigger things.<br/><br/>Her father, J.K Simmons and step-mother Allison Janney support Juno through her hard time. Both seem more eager to help Juno through this, then to throw her through a wall, which is what would normally happen in other flicks. Janney takes her to her ultra-sound test and defends her when her teenage motherhood is brought into question, Simmons accompanies her to the adoptive parents house, to make sure she isn't taken advantage of. The adoptive parents are Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. An odd pairing if you ask me, but both play their characters very well because it suits them as so. Bateman is a man trying to get back his youth, while Garner is desperately in need of a child to call her own. While it is odd to see the two paired together, they work very well when they are apart.<br/><br/>Jason Reitman shows us that he is not simply a one trick pony. With the success of his first feature ""Thank You For Smoking"" and this year's ""Juno"", Reitman is on the fast track to becoming the hot new thing in Hollywood. His care and attention for the film is apparent throughout. Juno at the abortion clinic is so paranoid and on nerve that she freaks out at the smallest things, which happen to be the little things people are doing around her, like scratching their arm or biting their nails. The emphasis of the sound on these small insignificant things, make them significant. His care for these characters that were created by Diablo Cody is from the heart. These people are every day people, with everyday problems. He knows this and shows this. Being pregnant isn't Juno's only problem, she has to deal with the people in her life who can't seem to find love. She needs reassurance that there is love out there.<br/><br/>The screenplay at first seems to be trying too hard to be smart and funny, but once it gets over itself, it becomes just that. The dialogue is quick and funny and said with ease from the actors. The story is simple and charming, yet feels complicated and depressing. Juno knows what she wants, but the world seems to be crashing down when things don't go her way. The amount of care put into these character are enormous, they are not here to simply tell a story, there are here to be the story.<br/><br/>The one fault is not from a writing standpoint, or technical or even from the acting. It's more personal. Without giving anything away, I'll just say that the film take a small detour from it's warm hearted comedy and goes into some depressing serious scenes. It didn't work too well for me. Although it is believable and contributes to the story, I felt that it would have been better if it had left that part out and taken a different turn.<br/><br/>Juno is this years ""Little Miss Sunshine"". Full of heart and charm and will entertain you to no end. It has a great soundtrack to boot. The music fits the film perfectly with mood and story. When 2007 saw pirates, ogres and superheroes flying around, all it took was a 16 year old girl to win our hearts and our attention."
"JeffJeanotte","9","3","12","19 December 2007"," Marketed to the mainstream? Good thing!
","I saw this movie and left with the feeling I saw something good. I had not previously seen Superbad and didn't know it stars one of the actors nor anything about the way the movie is being marketed. I have seen reviews now that have described the film as a new generation of movies trying to be the next Napolean Dynamite/Garden State ""popular"" Indies. I honestly don't care in this case since this movie was very funny and it came off fresh. Ellen Page might not be the average 16 year old but she works so well on screen and in my opinion was able to make the sometimes over the top dialogue convincing. I am very exited to see more of her and hope that she and the writer will make more collaborations in the future. I felt the same way after seeing Hard Candy and think she will come far as an actress. There is something about her that is different and it's really exiting. The whole cast was great also and there are some memorable scenes that should stick for a while. Let's do hope that there will be more movies like this marketed to a mainstream audience. I haven't seen a movie with so much energy and spark in a while and it's nice."
"rooprect","6","2","7","5 November 2010"," Didn't like it at first, but it seeps in.
","I committed the cardinal sin of seeing this movie just because it was so hyped up and was nominated for a kajillion awards. It didn't measure up to my inflated expectations. But since then I've seen it 2 more times, and I really like it.<br/><br/>It's been a while since I've watched a coming-of-age teen film (the last probably being ""Sixteen Candles"" in the theater, so that ought to give you an idea of how frequently I do this sort of thing). If you belong to my generation, the humour of ""Juno"" may seem low-key and on the sarcastic side, but I guess the world isn't about cutesy Molly Ringwald anymore.<br/><br/>Ellen Page is cute & engaging, though in every scene she seems like she's 2hrs late on her anti-depression medication (she's not nearly as fun as she was in ""Whip It""). I thought her co-star Olivia Thirlby stole the show as the slightly flakey, slightly slutty cheerleader. It's ironic that Olivia Thirlby would star in the shameless 2008 ripoff of this film, ""The Wackness"", which left me with a horrid impression of her. But I blame that on The Wackness's lame script and weak presentation and utter stupidity and total lack of reality and a douchenozzle for a director. But I digress...<br/><br/>""Juno"" on the other hand is solidly crafted, with a surprisingly powerful performance from Jennifer Garner. My only real criticism is that they shouldn't have cut out all the deleted scenes (included on the DVD). The theatrical version didn't really cover everything--for example, the big fight & sudden tension between Juno and Bleeker--and as a result you may think certain characters are overreacting to nothing. However, if you watch the deleted scenes, you get more of a feeling why things are so tense.<br/><br/>For now, I'll give this movie a 6, and if they release an extended director's cut, I may bump it up a point or two."

","Juno is an excellent example of filmmaking that I consider to be one the best films of the decade. Everything is done right with movie. The actors all do a good job, the writing is great, the jokes are funny, and the emotional stuff does work. It really is one of those special little movies that comes out of nowhere and surprises you. I also really liked the soundtrack for the film. The ending with where the two characters are singing along with each other is such a great scene made even better by the great song they are singing. Juno is the pure definition of what a sleeper hit is. Nobody knew what it was when it came out, and in the end people were talking about it. This film hits all the right notes.<br/><br/>4 stars out of 4"
"Eternality","8","2","7","10 August 2010"," Page spouts lines after lines of fascinating remarks with such eloquence that not falling in love with her character would have been sinful.
","One of 2007's most anticipated Oscar-nominated pictures, Juno is this year's Little Miss Sunshine; a quirky, witty, and highly original film that deserves its four Academy Award nominations, and might just snatch a couple of wins during Oscar night. While some may debunk its originality because it's the third film this year after Judd Apatow's Knocked Up and Greg Mottola's Superbad to touch on the increasingly discussed subject matter of teenage delinquency - here being teenage pregnancy.<br/><br/>Jason Reitman (Thank You For Smoking) earns a slightly undeserved Best Director nomination for Juno; there are limited opportunities for Reitman to show off his directing talents. His Oscar berth should have been given either to Ridley Scott or Tim Burton for American Gangster and Sweeney Todd respectively, both of which showcase far more accomplished directorial ability. But most importantly, Juno succeeds because of two major factors - Ellen Page's performance in the title role and Diablo Cody's screenplay.<br/><br/>Together, Page and Cody form a lethal partnership. Cody writes with considerable skill while Page has the charisma and persona to pull off such a demanding role as Juno. I believe there's no other young actress whom could have digested and performed Cody's script to perfection. She spouts lines after lines of fascinating remarks with such eloquence that not falling in love with her character would have been sinful.<br/><br/>Comparing with Knocked Up, Juno falls short of giving viewers that overwhelming, it-sweeps-me-off-my-feet movie experience that is apparent in the former. Since Juno runs at just over ninety minutes, it feels short-lived; Knocked Up, on the other hand, clocked more than two hours and thus feels more complete and ultimately, more satisfying. In my opinion, Juno will not win Best Picture or Best Director, although there are pretty good scoring chances at the other two nominated categories. One thing's for sure though - Ellen Page is undoubtedly the next hottest property of Hollywood.<br/><br/>SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

","It's not like I'm a huge Ellen Page fan, I think I've seen one other movie she was in, but despite that I've never seen a more worthy performance. She absolutely nailed her role, there's no question about it, she deserved an Oscar more than any other nominee in the past decade. It's not just her either, the entire cast did a great job in the movie I saw it strictly for Michael Cera (I know he does crap movies, but the man is seriously funny) who had a minor role. Jason Bateman, if nothing else, proved he could play an extraordinary straight-man (again). If there was a weakest link it was Jennifer Garner & that's a pretty high bottom of the barrel. It's clear that Jason Reitman knows how to get the best out of his cast. I'd recommend this film, Ellen Page will make you laugh."

","What's more annoying than a low budgeted; dialogue heavy; 'quirky' independent film featuring young performers of whom don't come across as even trying that hard? Answer is: a low budgeted; dialogue heavy; 'quirky' independent film featuring young performers, of whom don't come across as even trying that hard, which every one, and I mean every one, likes apart from yourself. Maybe it's just me; maybe I just cannot connect with films like Juno, although my track record with quaint, somewhat dainty, introverted independent films set amidst no-where towns whilst revolving around people you feel COULD exist but probably don't isn't that bad, as I was rather a fan of Lars and the Real Girl, but Juno is a straw of some sort of finality.<br/><br/>Here we have a film that stomps you into the ground in its demand you enjoy it; an experience so misguided and all over the place, a film that likes to think is grounded within the boundaries of realism but in actual fact is practically taking place in an alternate universe; a film that it is impossible to invest time and effort into, with people equally impossible to watch without squirming in your seat. Juno takes place in the cut off nether-regions of Minnesota in America; a place so isolated and scary in the sorts of people that inhabit it and what they get up to, that it makes a time spent away in the icy command post Russell and co. inhabited in 1982's The Thing, look desirable. Juno takes place in a world in which people name their children things like 'Liberty Bell'; it unravels in a place in which middle aged men name their acoustic guitars; it unfolds in a place in which if you arrived there, you'd want to get the Hell back out again after spending no more than five minutes in the company of any of the characters we engage with.<br/><br/>Ellen Page plays the titular role, a very young and very pregnant girl whom lives with her parents; goes to a high school; drives; visits the mall and interacts with her friends in the most excruciating ways it is possible for American, high school girls to do so on screen. The film is quick to establish the juxtaposition of a seemingly perfect family set up with the scenario of a teenager in a less-than desirable situation.<br/><br/>On one of the first times we see her, she sits on the concrete steps of her house and a certain Paulie Bleeker (Cera) jogs by in his running gear. She gazes at him, and catches a glimpse of certain parts of his body through his gear. Problem is; if the gender roles had been reversed here, and it had been told through a male perspective under this false, pretentious umbrella of quaint and quirkiness in a world that doesn't exist; and the character that runs by had been female, there'd probably be an uproar. It's feminism gone mad, and I'm all for feminism – I think this 'high school comedy' sub-genre has had some dismal efforts of late, what with films like Superbad; films that take the male perspective and just deliver totally out of order tails about how women exist and should be treated, but Juno is so mind numbingly, bash-your-head-against-the-wall annoying in its dainty atmosphere and false, romanticised approach to a subject matter completely ill suited to the aesthetic Juno is aiming for, that it has to be considered as frightening as things like Superbad, only for different reasons.<br/><br/>So where do we go from here; well, her parents/guardians/whoever find out and Juno hits on the notion she will give the baby up for adoption. But, to whom? Why, the equally quirky/dainty/flimsy/cooky (any adjective ending in 'y', sounds like 'e') middle-class couple Mark (Bateman) and Vanessa (Garner) Loring! How inspired. Given the subject matter, the film comes across as a soppy and oddly harmless piece that I think very much underestimates its subject matter, and the Boring family's (sorry, I meant ""Loring"" family's) attitudes are the visual representation of the film's burning problem: 'What do we want to do?'; 'How do we want to do it?' 'Am I (Are we) doing the right thing here?'. The film's secondary study, twinned with its overall failings, revolves around indecision.<br/><br/>As characters, Garner's Vanessa is infuriatingly annoying. She comes complete with an energetic characteristic which just makes her constantly pressing and persistent twinned with the fact her smile, teeth and ear-bleedingly tinny, 'nails-down-a-blackboard' voice do nothing for you as you attempt to invest time and emotion with these people and predicaments. Juno even feels the need, out of nowhere and rather ill-advised in my opinion, to break off into some sort of creepy, would-be relationship between the titular character and Mark, with whom they frequently branch off into tired, meandering, uninspiring and frankly quite dull passages of talk about popular music.<br/><br/>So the film ponders and wades on, complete with drippy soundtrack and with a generally wet feel to it all. There's a scene at a shopping mall in which, if there was a little light in the corner of your screen, it would begin blinking to let you know moral choices; decisions and responsibility etc. is about to be played out, when Juno sees a mother and child very much enjoying one another's company and, you know what? Juno thinks; she ponders and asks herself some questions about really wanting to give it away – where everyone takes a collective sigh, I take a collective breath as I hold in pent-up rage. As what Juno really wants is called into question, so to is what the would-be foster parents really want, both in a sequence that will end with the rug being yanked out from under our feet, in a highly annoying manner. I found Juno a stroppy, laborious experience that was frequently painful and consistently frustrating."

","Why do people keep praising this movie? I don't get it. I remember being in high school and yes there were Junos in my school, there were Bleekers too. <br/><br/>This suffers from the same problem as ""Superbad"". The two main characters are really not that likable. Ironically, Mr Bleeker was one of the two unlikable main characters from ""Superbad"". That's two for two! Sorry but he just really isn't. By the end of the movie I found myself not caring about him. If he got hit by a bus, that would have been a nicer plot twist. <br/><br/>That's another thing, there was no plot twist. This movie is so linear that it's not funny. It's like a bad video game, the kind you borrow once from your buddy, beat it the first time you play it and then never play it again. <br/><br/>The soundtrack was terrible! That was probably the one thing that REALLY grated on my nerves. Where did they find these musicians? I've seen drunks at karaoke that perform better. I swear if anyone ever brings the soundtrack to this movie to my house, I will microwave it!<br/><br/>There's one final thing that annoyed me, that was the girl outside of the abortion clinic. They didn't have to portray her the way they did. She represents one opinion. Clearly, the writer and/or director has a wildly different one. There's no need to overstate, to cram it down the viewers throats the way they did. This just further fuels a fire, that's all it does. I don't want to watch a movie so that someone can preach to me about how they feel about these type of issues, I watch movies for entertainment. Imagine that! <br/><br/>I give this one a 5 out of 10 for exactly two reasons: <br/><br/>J.K. Simmons & Jason Bateman<br/><br/>They carried this movie."

"VoiceOfEurope","6","2","7","18 September 2008"," Overrated? True. Worthless? It is not.
","Wow, it looks like everybody's getting very political about this movie. I did not think being pro or against abortion was such a dividing and decisive issue in the States. But so it seems. However, I'd rather not take sides, if you don't mind.<br/><br/>Juno definitely is overrated. But is it any surprise to anyone? It is not a new phenomenon that movies, the merits of which are scarce or disputable pocket a swath of coveted awards. Being politically correct or articulating an opinion popular with those setting the rules can by itself be very fruitful. No elaborate plot, sophisticated camera movement, sublime dialogue or unforeseen twists are needed to get the collecting of statues and shiny artifacts of all sizes started. Juno is lacking most of the above qualities, but still I did not feel that deceived to have sat it through. Yes, it is cute, and it is not very likely that a 16-year-old, music channel led teen would own up to her situation this maturely, but I'd be lying if I said I did not enjoy Juno at all. A few lines of conversation are quite funny, Juno's cynical remarks are sometimes rather witty (and likable, provided you can put it aside that they are more likely to come from the mouth of a thirty-something intellectual), while the acting of Ellen Page is far better than average. She is a natural. You still can tell she is playing a role but given her age and her tendencies of always making the most of it, no great imagination is needed to predict she will be world-class very soon.<br/><br/>Juno would have made a funny, lightweight comedy even the most unrelenting, most critical, stone-faced film buffs could have enjoyed to a certain extent had it not been for the fragile and divisive issue it brings forth. 'Cause yes, it was meant to be a comedy. So don't tell me that Jennifer Garner's tears are about the only thing in its right place."

"Hancock_the_Superb","6","2","7","15 May 2008"," A very mixed bag
","Juno MacGuff (Ellen Paige) is a quirky, motor-mouthed, vulgar and stuck-up 16 year old girl living in the middle of nowhere, Minnesota with her equally quirky stepparents (JK Simmons and Allison Janney). Her life changes drastically when she gets knocked up by her friend, track star Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). Rejecting abortion as an option, Juno decides to allow the baby to come to terms - deciding to give the baby to Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner), a childless couple who desperately want a baby. As Juno comes to term, she realizes the depth of her feelings for Paulie, but also discovers Mark and Vanessa may not be as happy as they seem - forcing Juno to wonder whether she can possibly have a happy relationship.<br/><br/>Juno announces the kind of movie it is right off the bat. A teenage girl drinking a quart of Sunny D walking down the street turning to animation and moody theme music? After that, you can't really make a mistake about the kind of film you're going to see. This isn't really my kind of movie, in spite of recommendations by friends and critics. It's an awkward cross between a snappy indie film and a typically vulgar teen flick. It succeeds in that it occasionally makes a good point and features some well-drawn characters. It fails in being a comedy or having a sympathetic protagonist, which prevent me from liking it any more than I do.<br/><br/>I have a decidedly weird and varied sense of humor. I like Monty Python and SpongeBob SquarePants as much as His Girl Friday or Sports Night. Hell, I find ESPN's Around the Horn side-splittingly hilarious. Witty barbs, pratfalls and gross-out humor are equally appealing to me, if done right.<br/><br/>Juno, however, falls under the category I despise. Diablo Cody's idea of wit is simply smart-ass, vulgar quips spouted off at a machine-gun rate. I did not laugh out loud once through the whole movie - a few smiles, and maybe a snicker or two, but that's it. Particularly repulsive were Juno's monologues about ""pork swords"" and the like, the hipster grocer, sight gags about condoms, underwear and Tic-Tacs. Wonderfully well-developed wit, that is. Juno's constant stream of faux-hipster slang (""Honest to blog!"") is equally cringe-inducing. Okay, some people on planet Earth talk like that. But on what planet does everyone? And on what planet does such a script win an Oscar?<br/><br/>And then there's Juno. It was certainly an interesting choice to make Juno an unlikeable character, but it's not really a successful one. Ellen Page is extremely unlikeable as she spouts Cody's pathetic excuse for humor. She comes across as a mean-spirited, smug, and superior. Her attitude towards the whole situation is believable, but her position on the baby is troubled; she doesn't want to abort it, but she has no remorse over giving it up for adoption? She doesn't develop the slightest feelings for the baby? It's hard to really care for such an individual. I do know people like Juno in real life, but I don't care for them, either. Only towards the end does Juno develop into a sympathetic character, which is fine, but hardly compensates for the first 70-plus minutes of smartass-itude.<br/><br/>And yet, the film has some strong redeeming qualities. The adult characters are surprisingly well-developed and overshadow their teen counterparts. Jennifer Garner is given a really sensitive and subtle character to work with, and she shines. Jason Bateman is equally good as her troubled husband; his relationship with Juno is very well-developed and adds an intriguing sideline to the main story. JK Simmons has some fine moments, and it's impossible not to find humor in an Allison Janney performance. Michael Cera as Bleeker is likable without having any real depth.<br/><br/>The movie succeeds in the last half-hour or so, when it shifts gears from being a faux-hip comedy to a fairly serious exploration of the subject matter. Juno's attempts to discover whether its possible to have a long-term relationship shows a level of maturity the rest of the film sorely lacks; her key scene with her dad and her final scenes with Bleeker are touching and believable. The movie's resolution somewhat bothers me; as mentioned above, can we really believe that Juno would have ZERO feelings about the baby? But the sweet ending does a decent job of glossing over this point, so perhaps complaining about it is pedantic.<br/><br/>Juno is a decidedly mixed bag. The target audience undoubtedly loves it, but I don't. Give me Aaron Sorkin or even Ten Things I Hate About You over the turgid excuse for comedy, but I can hang onto the character development and story ideas. But to my dying day, I'll never understand how this film was worthy of a Best Picture nomination.<br/><br/>6/10"
"rosti-4","7","2","7","3 May 2008"," Simple Story Packed With Laughs
","Juno? Like the city in Alaska? No. This film starring Ellen Page as a pregnant teenager and Michael Cera as Paulie Bleeker (the father and best friend) will indubitably make you sob in laughter. The story is a simple one; it follows a 16 year old, eccentric girl named Juno, who gets pregnant. The plot follows her nine months of laughter, hardships, and new found friendships as she keeps the baby so she can give to an eager couple played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. This film was well received by critics everywhere, winning a total of 38 awards, one of them being an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Juno got it all for a great reason: it's a pretty good film.<br/><br/>The movie introduces the characters in the best way possible. At once you feel a connection with Juno and everyone else she interacted with. Ellen Page and Michael Cera worked adorably together, you can see their charisma but also feel a sort of tension between them during the film, especially during the scene where Juno moves a living room set on Paulie's lawn, that was fun to watch. Mark's scenes (Jason Bateman) were refreshing, but often uncomfortable due to little thing going on with Juno there, but the character himself was great all because he owned such pretty guitars.<br/><br/>The music in this movie was unique, strange, and refreshingly simple. Had I heard it anywhere else I probably would have hated it, but it's just right for this movie. It fits the weird characters and overall the oddness of the movie. It's mainly composed of simple guitar strums and drunk sounding people singing about whatever, but also features bands such as Sonic Youth.<br/><br/>I loved the acting. It's just eerie how good of an actress Ellen Page is, she really made the character lovable and funny. The way she defined relationships with other characters was fantastic, they seemed authentic. I also commend Jennifer Garner for breaking reality, she's talented enough to make you forget she's acting, which was a problem for me in the film. Leah's character (Olivia Thirlby) was interesting, but made the film seem just a bit artificial, we could have done without her.<br/><br/>I generally enjoyed this film. It was a great laugh with a simple story line. Usually something like that doesn't work out, but the way it was composed made it a refreshing watch. The actors and actresses all worked well together on the screen and they were fun to watch, the movie was just a little weak when it came to personal character development. And it was hard to forget that they were just actors on the screen. However, the music makes up for it, the simplicity of it gives the film the whole quirky feel. If you're looking for a movie for a good night-in on a Friday night, then this would be a superb choice. Its comedy is what makes it up, but it does it well."

","This movie isn't bad, but it's not very good either.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people fall for this movie because Ellen Page did such a good job. She single handedly sold this movie, she perfected a character that is very unique and people want to watch, despite it being an unrealistic personality (if there's anyone that acts like that, they are the only one, this movie doesn't represent anyone, certainly not the average pregnant teenager). People fall for her and then overlook all of this movies faults.<br/><br/>The reactions of the characters aren't realistic at all, and in some cases just bizarre. A few character's give off false impressions, whether it's intentional or not, it's silly. The characters also lack chemistry, a couple combinations aren't bad but the awful dialog mixed with these actors did not mesh together.<br/><br/>I heard great things about this and after the first 5 minutes I thought this would be a great movie, but for every good part of the movie there was a bad part right around the corner."

","While not a bad movie (I've seen so many of the newer films that are terrible), JUNO could have been a lot better. The characters do not ring true, especially JUNO herself. Very annoying character, or maybe it was the performance of Ellen Page. She and Michael Cera were supposed to act ""normal"" that they made their characters ""unreal"". Trying to act natural was the biggest drawback to their performances. The stuttering and stumbling for words don't work. Picture would have been better with better actors. Can't believe Ms. Page was nominated for an Academy Award. All the other actors were just fine, especially J.K Simmons and Alison Janney. These young ""actors"" could take lessons from these pros. I'm sure part of the problem was the direction. The story is so good, but the execution of it was not. Also, a bit to ""quirky"" for me. A very pretentious way of film-making."

Juno is a smug pseudo sophisticate teenager typical of suburban girls of a certain age who have discovered their sexuality and now consider themselves ""worldly"". My impression was that the parents were more together than the teen daughter (see line: ""Do you think that this was Bleeker's idea?""). Although Juno was a nice ""slice of life"" film I didn't really see that it made a point.

The character of Juno, to me, seemed unlikable and full of herself- I could not, as a man, relate to her situation and I certainly could not sympathise for her terrible taste in music. A lot of people enjoyed this movie- and I wasn't sure why. I asked one person if they enjoyed the movie to which they replied ""yes"". I then asked if they enjoyed the classic of film, 'Chinatown' to which they replied ""No- it was boring."" If you think 'Chinatown' was boring (which it certainly was not) go and see this movie.

"rajdoctor","5","2","7","6 March 2008"," Juno
","Juno I read many good reviews on IMDb about this movie, and it while I write this review it is currently rated at no. 148  best movie list.<br/><br/>The story is about a 16 year old girl Juno (played by 20 year old Ellen Page) who finds that she is pregnant by a simpler and ordinary guy, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). She decides for abortion  but finding that the baby in the womb might have grown nails  decides to mother the baby. She concludes that she will find a suitable rich, good and lovely couple to rear her child  she finds one in Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) and Mark (Jason Bateman). Juno delivers the baby  but in doing so, gets in touch with some basic truths of life and love.<br/><br/>This movie is a big hit among young girls. The theatre I sat in to see this movie, 80 percent of the audience was below 18 years girls. (I was surely surprised and shy) The movie has also won the Oscars for best original screenplay writing  the award goes to Diablo Cody. A lot of the credit for what the movie has turned out to be should go to three persons  one Diablo Cody, second the director Jason Reitman (Thank you for smoking) and third the actress Ellen Page (who is acting since she is 10 years old).<br/><br/>Diablo Cody  a media graduate, turned secretary, stripper, blog / storywriter turned screenwriter is an inspirational life to read. She creates this character Juno  smart and over confidence beyond her age, and delivers dialogues that are not heard routinely. There are so many sequences in the movie that are so unreal but is not the fictional movie industry a fantasy? Jason Reitman  sticks to the simplier task of pure screenplay adaptation. Ellen Page  portrays a difficult character, that is difficult to perceive  let alone play it. A 16 year old girl talking the language of a lady who is older than 26-27 years of age.<br/><br/>I think, the trigger of connect with this movie could be a whipped up psyche of gender equality hungry audiences who gets a straw to hang on with this bold persona.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the best part of the movie is the musical score by Matt Messina  it so touchy.<br/><br/>The relationship between the couple Vanessa and Mark (looking to adopt a baby) is so deceptively written  always ahead of what the audiences think  that it is really entertaining and intelligent.<br/><br/>The last 20 minutes of the movie are the most engrossing and best. The vivid superficiality until that point converts to a deeply touching wind-up.<br/><br/>I have never come across such careless, dis-respectful and arrogant character and it surely is difficult to accept.<br/><br/>The sad part of gender equality - especially relating to women - is that the trend of futuristic women are shown having all the bad behavior, bad characteristic, bad thoughts and bad actions of men - ie abusive, aggressive, over-confident etc. Now a days people think that this is good and intelligent thing, but I am not sure!?

","""Juno"" really is as smart and as sweet as all the hype, its Oscar and a slew of nominations says it is. I suppose you could say it's the teen chick flick that isn't, as Diablo Cody's sassy and grown-up script serves a series of one-liners that might just be beyond most teenagers, both in the audience and on the screen. Cody may be a former 'exotic dancer' and this may be her first script but don't feel inclined to pre-judge her as some sort of novelty act; brainless, she ain't. Most people by now will know it's the story of Juno, pregnant at sixteen from the opening frame, who decides not to have an abortion, (a moral choice but made on the flimsiest of motives), but gives the baby up for adoption instead, (again on the flimsiest of motives).<br/><br/>Again, if anything, the movie, however well-written, feels peculiarly like real life. The direction of Jason Reitman is unobtrusive; there are no 'big moments'. If, for the most part, people behave a little too nicely towards each other, their lives are no less messy for all that and the trajectory isn't necessarily conventional. And like the best independent films it doesn't fall into the trap of trying to please its audience and pull them in; it just does.<br/><br/>It is, of course, blessed with the performance of Ellen Page in the title role. This is a wonderfully focused performance, easy-going and natural; that it seems effortless may be down to the slack which Reitman has allowed her or simply to the quality of Cody's script but whatever, Page is a star in the ascendant. But then all the performances have a wonderful natural quality to them; even the most unsympathetic characters, the adoptive parents, bear the brunt of Cody's scrutiny. Let's hope her Oscar isn't the kiss of death as I certainly am looking forward to seeing what Diablo does next."

The basic storyline of the film is that a teenage girl gets pregnant and the whole film is about her choices as a teenage, soon to be, mother. The whole film is realistically acted throughout, due to it's top-notch cast - Ellen Page as Juno (who has been nominated for an Oscar for her role), Michael Cera who plays Paulie - the father-, Jenifer Garner who plays Vanessa and Jason Bateman who is Mark , are the adopters, Allison Janney who plays Juno's step-mother Bren and J.K. Simmons who is Juno's biological father Mac. Now thats pretty much it, the film has been nominated for best picture, best director (Jason Reitman), best actress (Ellen Page) and best screenplay (Diablo Cody) in the 80th Academy Awards. Even though it may sound like a chick-flick or whatever it's not so don't get put-off by the storyline, it's brilliant!"
"Andy-296","8","2","7","18 February 2008"," Warm and entertaining
","In a small town in America (in Minnesota, though it's never named in the movie), Juno, a wiseacre sixteen years old, finds herself pregnant after her sexual debut with her sweet high school pal and band mate (Michael Cera). With the support of her loving father and stepmother, she decides against an abortion, and plans to give her newborn child to a seemingly perfect but barren yuppie couple (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). But things will not go as planned, and under pressure, the couple will show themselves not as perfect as they first seem. Overall, a great film, with great songs (mostly by Kimya Dawson and the Moldy Peaches) and a superb performance in the title role by Ellen Page (an actress to watch in the future, that's for sure). Other great performances are by Bateman (as a child in man's clothes) and JK Simmons as Juno's understanding dad. As other reviewers has said, the first half hour is somewhat off putting, because Juno's such a smart ass, always spouting clever retorts and comebacks, that she threatens to be unbearable (any other actress playing the character would probably make it unwatchable). But the movie improves in the key scene of Juno breaking the news of her pregnancy to her parents. After that, the movie gets better and better, and it is quite moving by the end. Clearly, the character of Juno matures a lot throughout the movie. On the abortion issue, I think the movie is pro life without screaming it. Is the movie realistic in this sense? Probably not, but it's warm and very entertaining. Some of the name dropping is off putting, though (a sixteen year old in small town America familiar with the movies of Dario Argento? I don't think so. The same goes for her presumed love for punk rock, and bands that have already stopped recording by the time she was born)."
"ajnanou","10","2","7","13 February 2008"," My new favourite movie
","Juno is, in one word, unexpected.<br/><br/>I've read that this is a ""comedy"", but to me it's more like a real-life drama. The funny bits come from the ""real life"" part of this great film and the witty dialogue. Some parts are funny without even trying to be. But because of the subject matter and the way it's dealt with, I wouldn't classify Juno as a comedy (unlike Knocked Up, which dealt with a similar pregnancy plot but was undeniably a comedy).<br/><br/>Now for the review. As I said, I was blown away by this film. The characters are so likable. I really like that Paulie Bleeker, for all his ""awkwardness"" and seemingly uncool looks, is the guy Juno chooses to love. It just shows that love is blind, and there really are great guys out there once we look past their shy or unassuming exterior. I also loved Vanessa - she was played perfectly as the wannabe-perfect person, but as the film goes on we realise that all of that is just nervousness and fear of disappointment, and that she really just wants a baby. But the real wowser is Juno herself. Ellen Page is wonderful. She portrays Juno's tough exterior wonderfully, but sometimes in her face we can just see all the emotions behind and that she's really only trying to be brave.<br/><br/>There's a wonderful plot twist in this movie, which I had genuinely not anticipated and which proved to be the difference between a good film and an awesome film.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I cried loads in the last twenty minutes (also because I could REALLY relate to the story).<br/><br/>All in all, Juno is one of my new favourite movies of all time.<br/><br/>P.S. The soundtrack is different - but pleasant - too, helping craft the uniqueness of this film."

","From the award winning director and creator of the movie "" Thank you for smoking"" - Jason Reitmen, we are being given a beautiful movie about life and adulthood, but mostly about growing up. <br/><br/>We meet Juno- a sixteen year old girl faced with an unsuspected pregnancy. She i smart, funny and mature for her age, but not ready for a baby. The movie let's us follow her on her travel to find another parent for her unborn child and also on her travel to find the truth about life. Juno faces the aspects of love, marriage and responsibility. <br/><br/>The acting is well adjusted and spectacular as well as the movie itself is a work of art. The movie has a good chance to catch an Oscar, not only because of its uncensored describing of life , but also because of the magnificent way of telling a great story.

"bentaylor121","6","2","7","7 February 2008"," Whats all the fuss about
","Im not saying this is a bad film, however how it deserves the title of one of the greatest films of 2007 is beyond me. the plot is very poor and follows another film involving pregnancy in knocked up. whereas knocked up deals with both emotions felt by the man and the woman with an unexpected pregnancy, Juno's character was the main focus of the film with the other roles being quite minimal in contrast. the comedy element is also lacking especially for a film as short as this. apart from childish quotes from Juno herself the comedy element is in short bursts and is not fluent throughout the film, and the emotional aspect isn't really touched upon either. there is no way this film deserves to be classified as better than other comedy/emotional of 2007 and how it gained all this critical acclaim is a question i keep on asking myself."
"Deathtyger","6","2","7","6 February 2008"," Classy & Cute
","I enjoyed the film a great deal because it was classy. It took the lives of two very realistic characters and put them into a very realistic problem. The characters were believable and touched on subject's student's embrace these days in high school. The comedy itself swings around the lifestyle of living in a somewhat small town vs. the larger city lifestyle. Where everyone knows everyone and everything you do so nothing goes unknown. But the main character has a funny way of dealing with all the issues at hand with her fast pace humor or quick jokes. So no matter the situation it seems nothing will ever be a let down. Life is never simple as it goes though and even when things seem as perfect as can be things can change on you. Through the strength of true friendship and trust along with the deeper understanding of love one can find ways to over-come what burdens the heart. You can find that with time problems can be resolved with careful planning and discussion. In the end everyone found their rightful place to be with lessons well learned."

","Jason Reitman's follow-up to 'Thank You For Smoking' is an intelligent, heart-warming, wing-nut of a comedy that makes you appreciate the in-your-face and intimate cinematic occasion it lays before you.<br/><br/>Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) finds that boredom only leads to one avenue; sex. And when she ends up pregnant, with the father being close-friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), she must dig deep within herself to not only mature over-night, but find adoptive parents for her soon to-be-delivered baby. Following Juno through various stumbling block's in her rocky road of mother-hood, one which sees Juno decide whether or not to get an abortion while her school-friend Su-Chin pickets the clinic outside (""All babies deserve to be borned"" she shouts as a one woman army), is awkwardly satisfying and ultimately funny for the on-edge viewer.<br/><br/>Ellen Page is a revelation as the book-smart, quick-tongued teenager facing adversity in the face with her impending pregnancy, and gives a performance that will either have you spilling your guts with laughter, or filling the aisles with tears - or even both. While Michael Cera (Paulie), J.K. Simmons (Mac MacGuff), Olivia Thirlby (Leah) and Jason Bateman (Mark Loring) provide adequate emotional back-up, making you genuinely feel in the heart of all their relationship's with Juno, especially Cera and Simmons. The only weak link, in a very strong chain is Jennifer Gardner as Vanessa Loring, who you never engage with her character till the penultimate scene of the film, when it's too late anyway.<br/><br/>One aspect which contributes drastically to Juno's success, and would be a cardinal sin to overlook, is debutant screenwriter Diablo Cody's script, which is full from the beginning to the end with engaging, entertaining and down-right witty dialogue. She creates Juno, a pretentious, naive teenager who over-time matures into an exciting and nurtured human being, while keeping her traits which we at the same time keeping the hilarious and charming moments ticking over. Despite a conventional ending which follows the genre like salt on chips, it's the chunky and delightful middle that keeps the film running and the audience happy.<br/><br/>Hilarious. Heart-warming. Enjoyable. Engaging. Cute. Interesting. Hip. You'll leave the cinema when it ends with a smile from ear-to-ear knowing you've just seen something special (and it wasn't the attractive young eighteen-year old girl bending down in-front). Now where did I leave my Hamburger phone...?"
"wisewebwoman","9","2","7","3 February 2008"," A breath of fresh air!
","I am so delighted I went out and saw this film after catching so many - in my opinion - truly awful films this season. My faith is restored.<br/><br/>The film follows a tried and true formula but whirls and spins it into something so delightful that one is left awestruck by the confluence of talent that made it all happen. A teenager gets pregnant and has to deal with the pregnancy. She is a bright and witty young woman and is nobody's fool. She marks out her own path for this pregnancy.<br/><br/>Juno MacGuff (played by Oscar worthy Ellen Page),is the 16-year-old who gets pregnant following an experimental sexual encounter (initiated by her) with her best friend and high school track star Paulie Bleeker (played by Michael Cera).<br/><br/>After flirting with the idea of an abortion, Juno decides on having the baby and giving it up for adoption to a couple Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) that have advertised in the local Pennysaver free paper. The scene where she breaks the news to her parents Mac MacGuff (J.K. Simmons) and step-mom (Allison Janney) just about brought down the house in the show I attended. <br/><br/>Thanks to the brilliance of the script (By Diablo Cody) ""Juno"" is a stream of witticisms from beginning to end and the supporting cast are flawless in executing them.<br/><br/>I found the underlying themes all coming to a satisfying fruition at the end. Every thread tied beautifully. There are many true emotional moments in the film and you are never quite sure where it is going. I was so glad it wasn't flawed by a hokey Hollywood ending.<br/><br/>But it all belongs to Ellen Page in the end. Her brilliance as an actor is confirmed for once and for all. She is in just about every scene and plays Juno as a sharp, sassy, intelligent and decisive young woman. She is quick, smart and competent and everyone knows it. Great musical score also.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. 9 out of 10."
"come2whereimfrom","7","2","7","31 January 2008"," Superb
","Diablo Cody, name not familiar? it will be for she has just written her first screenplay and it's a corker. Directed by Jason Reitman who you may remember did the excellent 'Thank you for Smoking' and the not so memorable 'Kindergarden cop' it tells the story of Juno MacGuff a wise cracking teenage who accidentally becomes pregnant and has to make some serious decisions about her unborn child. Michael Cera, famous for playing George-Michael in the vastly overlooked TV show 'Arrested Development' and as hapless student Evan in last years Comedy 'Superbad' is brilliant as the unwitting father who everyone believes 'I didn't know he had it in him'. The supporting cast are a collection of faces that include Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner and Spiderman's own J. Jonah Jameson, J. K Simmons; all are great but its Ellen Page as Juno who steals the show firing off one liners like they were written by Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). Some have called the movie this years 'Little Miss Sunshine' and they wouldn't be far wrong, it's sharp and funny and may just be this years surprise Oscar winner and box office smash."
"kyrone01","8","2","7","30 January 2008"," True human emotions
","Without having a great story to tell, this movie manages to make us sentimentally involved as it focuses mainly in true human emotions. Of course, this would have never had happened without the great performances and especially the world-class performance of young Ellen Page which rightfully deserves to be awarded by the Academy. Generally speaking it is a very good movie which keeps unfolding a rather commonplace story in such a way that we never get tired, and finishes in a sweet-bitter way which makes us feel better people. I give it 8 out of 10 mainly because of its great performances which result in a movie that we do not meet often."
"colonel_green","9","2","7","29 January 2008"," One of my favourite films of 2007.
","Every so often, a little independent film produced on a shoestring budget becomes a critical and box office hit, propelling its star into the spotlight. The most recent example of this would be ""Little Miss Sunshine"", which eventually secured an Oscar for veteran supporting actor Alan Arkin (with a little help from ""Norbit""). ""Juno"" follows in the footsteps of that film, but it earns considerable marks for being much, much less annoying.<br/><br/>The story is about the title character, Juno, a teenaged girl who gets pregnant after having sex for the first time with her friend Bleeker (Michael Cera, best known for the TV series ""Arrested Development"" and the hit film ""Superbad""), and decides to keep the baby after an abortive visit to an abortion clinic. She picks Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner, from the great TV series ""Alias"", and Jason Bateman, also from ""Arrested Development"") as the adoptive family for her child. One of the notable things about ""Juno"" is that, until the third act, there really isn't much in the way of dramatic conflict; Juno's parents (J. K. Simmons, best known as J. Jonah Jameson in the ""Spider-Man"" films, and the invaluable Allison Janney of ""The West Wing"") are unconventionally accepting of this development, and do no become the needlessly confrontational figures so often seen in films like this. When the real drama comes, it involves Juno and the Lorings, particularly the prospective adoptive father.<br/><br/>The performance of actress (and Atlantic Canadian; woot!) Ellen Page has attracted most of the critical attention, including an Oscar nomination for Best Actress that she may very well win. It is indeed an impressive performance, worthy of the award. Also impressive is Jennifer Garner, a favourite actress of mine, who takes a yuppie stereotype and injects it with humanity and vulnerability. The rest of the cast is also strong.<br/><br/>The sole sour note, in my opinion, is the soundtrack, which is composed entirely of annoying indie acoustic music with pretentiously nonsensical lyrics. This is one area where I'd have preferred a more traditional approach.<br/><br/>""Juno"" is often grouped with ""Waitress"" and ""Knocked Up"" as a trio of 2007 pregnancy comedies where unplanned pregnancies are taken to term; the politics of this has been debated in some circles. In my opinion, ""Juno"" argues that while abortion should be available, it is a practice that many find unacceptable, even if they are open in principle to it (it also rather prominently mocks pro-life protesters) (""Waitress"" I would characterize as more clearly pro-life, at least in the perspective of the main character, although that is also a choice).<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a very enjoyable film, and highly recommended."
"jo-annaclark","9","2","7","27 January 2008"," A superbly written dark comedy for the everyday person
","A superbly written dark comedy involving a dynamic cast where one had to remind them self that this was in fact a movie and not a story about someone they knew. The premise, brilliantly simple; teenage girl gets pregnant and while one might think ""and"" you cannot help but become enthralled in the sarcastic witty banter of day-to-day life. As is the trend in recent movies and perhaps one of its endearing qualities is that it escaped the fantasy movie land depiction of pregnancy and settled right into the norm of lower middle class. The cast displayed a comfortable rapport, setting the stage for believability. For me the only minor fault was the instant acceptance of the father to the news of his ""June-bugs"" pregnancy. Personally I was expecting that to be one of the (albeit minor) obstacles. Superb performances by Ellen Page (Juno), Jason Bateman (Mark Loring), and J.K. Simmons (Mac MacGuff)! Allison Janney's (Bren MacGuff) performance while enjoyable did not seem that different then her role as Loretta in the 90's flick Drop Dead Gorgeous. Jennifer Garner (Vanessa Loring) did a wonderful job of playing the uptight adoptive parent. And finally Michael Cera (Paulie Bleeker) did a good job playing yet another awkward teenager (but it will interesting to see what this young star will offer next). Overall I would give this movie falls within the range of 8.7 to 9.1."
"MIentertainment","Null","2","7","11 January 2008"," Juno: Humor with a Heart
","Here is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed. ""Juno"" stars Ellen Page as a sixteen year old high schooler confronting an unplanned pregnancy. Now this may not seem like fodder for a comedy but it works on many levels. When Juno finds out she is ""with child"" courtesy of here semi boy friend, she breaks the news to her parents, played wonderfully by Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons. After considering the options, Juno finds her unborn child a ""perfect"" set of parents: an affluent suburban couple, Mark and Vanessa played by Justin Bateman and Jennifer Garner. Between the laughs are some serious moments as all of these characters learn lessons about life and do some growing up. Ms. Page is wonderful in her role as is the Michael Cera as the boyfriend who remains loving and loyal through it all. I did think Bateman over played the Dad to be with a secret to the point of being creepy and there were some scenes that were a little unbelievable.. That said this one gets a good three out of Fordyce. I think you will enjoy it. And while it is rated PG 13, it is a movie for mature audiences. Jim Fordyce www.MIentertainment.biz"

No and no.<br/><br/>Honestly, I thought this was a great movie. I certainly don't expect you have the exact same reaction, you may not even like it. That's fine.

","Overall, the acting in this movie was brilliant, in part because of the great script. But Michael Cera's role as Bleaker was perfect. His role was limited to an extent but what he brought to the table was this subtle, quiet, fragile ""individual"" who doesn't seem to sure who or what he is. Bleaker is never affected by anything it seems, especially when his ""girlfriend"" tells him that she's pregnant, and he's the daddy. He's not holding back any emotions or anything, just being himself; an introverted teenager just wanting to ""run by"" without anybody noticing. I can't say enough about how great this movie was.

","Juno- Oh those witty pregnant teens. It was okay actually, the dialogue was funny, but pretty stilted after a point, specially towards the end. I wasn't really looking forward to going to the free screening, but I was pretty entertained the whole way through, it was better than I expected. A lot of movies aiming for endearing cute quirkyness are either stale or forced, or transparent. And though this was guilty of all of those at times, they are not too numerous to drag it down completely. Better than ""She's Having A Baby"", it's most immediate rival, which indeed it excels beyond in terms of range of human drama. The end, for all it's adorability still strikes a wrong chord with me, like the ending of Garden State, it's becomes overwhelmed with sentimentality, which is supposed to excuse the lack of honest resolution, the film has made it's heart, ""what is going to happen to this quirky young pregnant girl"", apparently nothing too drastic, she get's a boy she likes and continues as normal. The most important theme of this film is responsibility, not the actual pregnancy, but how different people at different points in their life are at different levels, which they and they alone can truly determine, which is refreshing in it's own way. I wouldn't go out and rent it again, but if it came on TV I wouldn't immediately turn."
"GeneSiskel","5","3","13","10 February 2008"," Painful
","As someone who has experienced adoption first-hand, I found the premise of this film, and the manner in which it was carried out, painfully unfunny. There was some pleasant charm in the relationship of Juno and her beau, and the character of Juno was a treat, but the plot was both largely implausible and curiously insensitive from a ""right to life"" standpoint. It's hard to figure why this film was nominated for an Academy Award in the best picture category. Of course, it's always hard to figure why any film is nominated. Some of the dialogue worked; some was precocious. In all, ""Juno"" has the feel of a low-budget independent film."
"hunterbick","9","3","13","16 January 2008"," A Delightful Movie That Delves Into Dangerous Waters
","Teenage pregnancy is still a taboo subject in American society today, we all know it. This movie sheds a light onto a relatively unexplored topic.<br/><br/>The main character Juno is a 16 year old who engages in some promiscuous activities and ends up pregnant. The story follows her from the beginning until she gives birth.<br/><br/>That is not the point of this review though, the main point is to reveal what is hidden by the previews, the utterly amazing soundtrack with the wit and sarcasm that is prevalent throughout the entire movie. From the main character to her friends and her parents, it helps show that teenage pregnancy is not all bad and there can be a happy ending. The adoptive parents angle shows another type of scenario that ends up for the best in the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see film and should win awards. There are very few Fox Searchlight Picture films that are this good, and as long as you can stay open to the idea of teenage pregnancy and not judge it for the content matter you will be able to enjoy this film for what it is, a humorous film with outstanding performances by the cast."
"aharmas","10","3","13","14 January 2008"," Something that we love for what it is
","This excellent film pulls off a trick that is harder to master in Hollywood than most people think, an original tale with enough bite to support its creative edge and plenty of heart to connect with even the most jaded in the audience. Most of its success comes from the lively turn by Elaine Page, a performer who can tackle a role better than 99% of her more famous contemporaries. She understand the dark side of comedy and how drama and comedy are, well, two sides of the same coin.<br/><br/>In this delicious film, a pregnant teenager discovers that life can surprise all the time. She learns as her pregnancy becomes more and more evident how good her support system is, and her learning comes from observing the reactions of those people she is now interacting with. It might be her hypersensitivity, probably due to hormonal changes in her body, or it might just be that she is now forced to deal with issues in a more mature manner. Whatever the case might be, Juno learns to appreciate the best qualities in people, the diamond in the rough that she is, and she discovers that wisdom can only be achieved by careful application of her unexpected learning.<br/><br/>Michael Cera and Jennifer Garner stand out in their supporting roles, but it's only fair to say that no one in this movie is not doing very good work. It is an ensemble piece, with plenty of heart and a sense of discover in material that we all thought we understood. These are complex issues and the resolutions are never by the numbers. Juno understand her uniqueness and has enough understanding of how far respect can go.<br/><br/>2007 has indeed been a good year for movies, and it should be stated that great comedies don't come by so often.

Miss Page plays Juno to perfection, creating a wise-cracking, sarcastic, and independent young woman and does an amazing job of never making her seem like a caricature. Her Best Actress nomination would be well-earned. The rest of the supporting cast is good, but Jennifer Garner especially sticks out in the role of Vanessa, a woman who wants to be a mother more than anything. I'm hoping Ms. Garner gets a Best Supportin actress nod as well.<br/><br/>The witty and original script by Diablo Cody sizzles. She is also guaranteed a Best Original Screenplay nod- she has the most buzz of anyone and is as much star of the film as Miss Page. Jason Reitman directs in a quick and lovely way, a good match in director for this film. It is a rather crude movie, especially at the beginning, but that is to be expected just from the premise.<br/><br/>Give Juno a look at your local cinema. The only caution I would give would be to not bring younger children to it. For more mature viewers, it will be well worth your money; a smart, well-acted, and very funny film. 8/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"

","(Synopsis) Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is a confident high school teenager who decides out of the blue to have sex with her friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). The result of Juno's first time connection is that she becomes pregnant. Juno decides to give birth to the baby, but she plans to give the baby up for adoption. Juno and her best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) look through the local Pennysaver newspaper for prospective parents. Juno believes that she has found the perfect couple, Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa Loring (Jennifer Garner) who is desperate to have a child. Juno's sensitive father (J.K. Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney) are very supportive of her and help Juno with her decision to give the baby up for adoption. Juno and her father check out Mark and Vanessa Loring to see if they are the right couple. As time moves closer to having the baby, Juno grows more into a woman, yet she is still a teenager with all the same problems and a few more.<br/><br/>(My Comment) The subject matter of a 16-year old having a baby out of wedlock is hard for teenagers to fathom. Most teenagers think they know everything, until something really important happens to them. The main character of Juno takes on the situation as if she was an adult and with the support of her parents, she understands and works out a solution. Juno is searching for where she belongs in life, and in so doing; she shows you what the reality of life is all about. Ellen Page gives a wonderful, convincing, and compelling performance as the free spirited Juno. The movie is hilarious and heartwarming at times. Overall it was an enjoyable feel good movie that you should go see. This is one of those sleeper movies that will get an Oscar nod. (Fox Searchlight, Run Time 1:32, Rated PG-13)(8/10)"
"Finnigin23","9","3","13","10 January 2008"," A short, unpretentious review
","I like IMDb for a lot of reasons, but mostly for these reviews. I like hearing what regular people think about movies as opposed to sifting through waves of arrogant critiques by overpaid movie critics. I think anyone reviewing a movie should be honest and upfront about what they liked, didn't like, etc. and just leave it at that. So that's what this is.<br/><br/>I had really high expectations for Juno. The trailer looked great and I'm a big fan of Michael Cera and of director Jason Reitman. Sometimes I get let down by a movie, but not this time. Juno is a fresh, honest look at an old subject - and one that's getting pretty popular these days - pregnancy. Diablo Cody's dialogue is sharp and clever while still staying true to her characters (especially the younger ones). This is one of the first movies I've seen in a while that captures the way kids in high school actually talk. That alone was enough to win me over.<br/><br/>The acting is close to perfect, highlighted by Ellen Page as the title character. Page is incredibly funny and really down to earth in her portrayal of a pregnant 16-year-old. She holds the movie together while being supported by solid performances from Jason Bateman, Allison Janney and Michael Cera among others.<br/><br/>The only knock against this movie is that it's kind of formulaic and sometimes comes dangerously close to corny, but Reitman steers the ship in unexpected (and successful) directions. Overall, Juno is a fun, sweet, clever film that should win some awards in the next few months.<br/><br/>More importantly, it should make any audience remember why they love movies. A good, well-written story with great acting and solid direction. 9/10"

"kenjha","7","2","8","28 September 2010"," Calculated but Entertaining
","A pregnant teen thinks about having an abortion, but then agrees to let a childless yuppie couple adopt the baby. This is generally entertaining but seems too calculated to be a genuine comedy-drama. Juno is meant to be an endearing young woman but she seems artificial. She's too much of a smart-ass for a sixteen-year-old, too nonchalant about the pickle she's gotten herself into, delivering one-liners like a stand-up comedian. It appears the filmmakers are trying too hard to be hip, but end up with something that feels like an after-school special. Page, Cera, Garner, Bateman, Janney, and Simmons all deliver good performances."

This film is fair, brings a couple of laughs and is quite coherent, and apart from the odd good music there's not that much laudable in this box; I can't get over the feeling that the film-makers have tried too hard to make this film feel all fresh, so much that they kind of overlooked the factor that made Ricky Fits the great character he was in ""American Beauty"". Watch ""L'Avventura"" again, I say."
"blackismylove","3","2","8","6 February 2009"," Juno a good movie? If you gave it more than 3 stars ""Ju DON'T no"" a good movie from a depends commercial
","Let me just start by saying that I don't necessarily hate it when a bad film gets made because, lets face it: people like weird things. It's why movies like ""Battlefield Earth"" are made. It's not because a bunch of people in Hollywood wanted to waste a lot of money. It's because consumer tastes are extreme and inconsistent. What I DO hate is when a bad movie is made and people love it because of a bunch of hyped up marketing techniques and not because its actually a good film.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is Juno, the main character, gets pregnant and decided to have the baby and plans to give it up for adoption to a preselected couple. Pretty simple basis. Right along with the simplistic delivery and poorly developed characters. The most thoroughly devised task these people had was to figure out just how and just how many trendy remarks and hipster referenced they could Jam into an hour and a half. LONG before I decided to sit down and actually watch it, I had already caught onto the possibility that this might not really be the timeless ""Oscar"" gem it had made itself out to be. It was probably the constant hamburger phone ads I kept seeing. ""You mean I could own the clunky, impractical CORD phone from that movie?"" I didn't buy into that. But pretenses aside, there were so many more things about this movie I didn't like AS I was watching it. Basically, it was a Myspace movie. It shallowly portrayed a real life, in-depth situation in a way that appealed to a demographic that is more entertained by trendy culture than it is by good movie making. There were too many attempts at coming up with the next Austin Powers or Borat catch phrase. To me, it was like trying to take Billy Mays seriously as an actor when he's trying to sell oxyclean. I feel insulted when a director doesn't even make an attempt to be subtle about product placement in a film. The only thing worse than having a commercial in the middle of a movie is when its done in a way that feels like you're being slapped in the face with a billboard. Even the music in the movie screamed for you to go out and buy it. It didn't set the mood or compliment the scene. It was just trying to wedge its way onto the big screen for exposure.<br/><br/>But the thing about this movie that really got on my nerves was that the fast-food, ""OMG LOL"" characters were supposed to represent my generation. Even if it was the way the actors were supposed to portray the characters, there was no intelligence, responsibility, or morality displayed by any of them and really thats the most aggravating trend for me to watch: having a repertoire of smart ass comebacks and pop culture references is a lot cooler than having any moral value.<br/><br/>I have to say that after watching Juno, I began to question the Oscar nomination selection process. There were no stellar performances, the camera work and photography was rudimentary, the music; out of place. This was the perfect example of how you can use the right amount of exposure and marketing techniques to sell just about anything. Just remember, you can put lipstick on a pig, but its still a pig."
"luvbugk615","6","2","8","11 November 2008"," OK! but thats all.
","This film is about a girl who gets pregnant to her best friend! Thats basically it. I will admit i do like this film. But not too much. It is a bit pointless really.

I like this film. But i have better films to watch! Great actors and actresses though.<br/><br/>This film can be a bit boring. And when it gets to the end you can see how it is quite pointless. Apart from seeing a girl sat on the toilet! Haha! I doesn't seem very realistic to me and seems a bit stupid because to be honest if i went home and said Mum and Dad Im pregnant they would kill me, not say ""Well we best get you healthy!"" I didn't even know you could put advertisements to adopt in the paper! Haha! <br/><br/>I think the actors in this are quite something. Juno at the end is great actor at being in labour, and Micheal Cira is also great and a bit hot for all the girlie's out there! <br/><br/>I recommend this film to teenagers, but to only watch it once! 6 out of 10! Sorry Juno!"
"sme_no_densetsu","7","2","8","5 October 2008"," Juno why this film is so popular? I don't.
","Jason Reitman's ""Juno"" is the kind of movie that splits audiences. In it, a sixteen year old girl who is supposedly incredibly mature for her age nevertheless finds herself pregnant. After initially cavalierly settling on abortion she has a change of heart and decides to have the baby and give it to a pair of loving parents.<br/><br/>For me, a big problem of the film is believability. If Juno was so wise beyond her years how did she manage to get herself into this situation in the first place? She seems so jaded that there's just about nothing that phases her. That's hard to believe from a sixteen year old with apparently no hard knocks in her life but considerably easier to believe from ex-stripper screenwriter Diablo Cody. It's like Cody said to herself, ""Teenage pregnancy? Big deal. If I had gotten pregnant when I was sixteen this is totally what I'd do."" That she won an Oscar for her work is amazing, in a pathetic sort of way. I also have a hard time believing that Juno cares about the child at all since she basically wants nothing to do with it. Obviously, if she can foster such feelings toward her own offspring then that pretty much proves that she's unfit for motherhood.<br/><br/>In my mind, another problem is the oh-so-hip dialogue that I find extremely grating. Everyone has a quip ready at a moment's notice no matter the situation. None of it is really meant to be laugh-out-loud funny, more like ""Look how clever I am!"".<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the film does manage to wring some actual emotion out of its material. The ending is fitting though to call this a coming of age story strikes me as ridiculous since I can't imagine that Juno actually learns anything. She seems to embody the Oscar Wilde quote, ""I am not young enough to know everything"". That makes her, as a character, quite unlikeable in my eyes.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Ellen Page herself is cute as button, which goes a long way in off-setting her character's know-it-all attitude. Michael Cera is a fine choice for her partner in crime; his character and his performance is much closer to reality. The rest of the cast is solid but not really noteworthy, even J.K. Simmons who is usually hilarious.<br/><br/>The direction by Jason Reitman is well done and was not undeserving of the Best Director Oscar nomination that he received. The music is pretty good too, even though it smacks of the same sort of ultra-hipness as the dialogue. In the end, I think that the film is worth watching but I shudder to think that there are young women out there who see Juno as a role model."
"ca26","7","2","8","16 September 2008"," Interesting but hard to care about
","Despite all the hype (mostly by women, I suspect), Juno is not that great or interesting of a film.<br/><br/>Granted, the production is top-notch, as is the soundtrack. And the performances by all the supporting cast were so believable, they made the movie worth watching.<br/><br/>However, the writing (for Juno, the main character) was odd and unbelievable. While the actress playing Juno was able to play the character competently, it just wasn't a realistic, or sympathetic character. Juno is kind of a boring jerk, spewing cynical and trite one-liners we've all heard a thousand times before on sit-coms. It's as though the writer of the movie envisioned this character as the coolest thing since sliced bread and gave her the ""i'm too cool to be cool"" dry one-liners and made everyone else her straight man. But ironically, I think it backfired because it made Juno, the girl, uninteresting right from scene 1, and it made all the characters around her compelling and tangible. I found myself ignoring Juno's often-pointless quips and honing in on her boyfriend's acting (and his amazingly subtle performance), or watching how real pros Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman acted. In fact, everyone BUT Juno was fun and interesting and I'd like to see more of them.<br/><br/>But I understand from reading a bit about Diablo Cody the writer that Juno herself was just an idealized extension of herself and that just didn't work for me. Juno came off too flat and too tired and too into herself to be a character I cared for. I mean, the instant Diablo wrote that all jocks secretly lust after the weird goth girls in school, I laughed my ass off at how Diablo must really think that the jocks really despised the hot pre-playboy blonds and instead thought that a greasy-looking, scrawny, tattoo'd chick with pale skin and a bad attitude was attractive. HA! lol. I think that just epitomizes how the main character was written about Diablo and for Diablo and frankly, Diablo's just not that interesting unless she's saying the word sex every now and then to keep the curious around.<br/><br/>The movie is well put-together and the supporting cast and soundtrack are worth the rental. If you like indie little feel-good flicks like Little Miss Sunshine, you'll like this. Though, I believe Sunshine had much more interesting dynamics in the relationships and I cared about the main character(s) right from the start.<br/><br/>thanks for listening."
"richard-810","7","2","8","24 August 2008"," Enjoyable, charming but everyone just too nice and sensible to be real
","The bottom line is that I really enjoyed this film, despite the feeling of having been manipulated. A well made movie with mostly terrific cast and a story about real people facing a human crisis in their everyday lives of the type that many of us are familiar with, a 16 year old schoolgirl from a 'respectable' middle class background getting pregnant. The reaction and behaviour of the characters is sensible, humane and comforting. What a better world it would be if everyone were as wise, kind and practical as the characters. This really is the issue that gave me (and other reviewers) significant reservations  people are not for the most part like this in real life. Sure, some major problems do have a happy outcome but very often they do not and things rarely go as smoothly as they do in this story. Ellen Page has received major plaudits for her undoubted acting ability but I found her a little too wise and articulate for her age, her performance and spiky charm too polished to be authentic. The star for me was Michael Cera, his characters discomfort, awkwardness and lack of confidence was far more convincing and closer to people of that age that I know. I think probably best to regard this movie as a modern fantasy rather than a snapshot of reality. But the movie does have a warmth and charm and certainly provides an enjoyable evenings entertainment. One further plus for me incidentally was the soundtrack, brilliant quirky little tracks that provide a perfect accompaniment to the story. Overall, see it and enjoy being manipulated."

"robertallenandersonjr","5","2","8","10 April 2008"," Not as good as people make it sound
","Juno was not nearly as good as I thought it would be. It is so over rated. People make this movie out to be such an original movie with great heart. First off its not original, they copied most of the story right off of Knocked Up which was very good. Second off their wasn't that much heart besides for Juno and her friend Pauly. The acting in this movie was really really good but I didn't think that Ellen Paige deserved to be up for any academy awards. The critics did like this movie along with the other movie about pregnancy. It seems to me like the critics like pregnancy type of movies. It was a very funny movie though don't get me wrong. It was a great teen comedy movie as well. I just think that I found Ellen Paige very annoying in this movie. Some of the phrases they used in this were very corny. It was very cute and had some great meaning but at the same time it was pretty boring. I guess I didn't like it as much maybe because im a teenage guy. This might be a movie more for girls. I think it was just not my kind of movie. I think that this movie was a great way to show teens what really can happen at this age. Teenagers today they don't wear protection as much as they should, just like in this movie. I really did like Michael Cera in this movie though. I think once again he did a great job. He really saves this movie in my opinion for me. Toward the end of this movie I was finding my self very bored. I would have to say that this was one of the happy, feel good movies of 2007. I can't make fun of this movie just because I didn't like it as much as i wished I would have. The critics liked it and it seems to me like everyone I ask liked it to. I just found that one of the messages in this movie was saying that its okay to go ahead and get pregnant at this age. At the same time they were also showing you what getting pregnant can do to you. Overall this was a very liked movie by most people. I think that you should definitely see this movie and just get a glimpse of how real this movie was."

","As somebody who saw this movie about 3 weeks after its release date, i for one was not jumping out of my seat for this movie.It had a fairly simple plot. Young teen gets pregnant and must decide what to do with baby. In my opinion this film got way to much recognition just for being an independent film. A major problem i had viewing this film was that it just couldn't keep my attention at the beginning. The first 20 minutes of this movie were pretty worthlessly written, however towards the middle it starts getting very interesting. This is a better than average film especially being so short on bucks, but it is not amazing by any means."
"KHayes666","6","2","8","22 February 2008"," Surprisingly good
","Life isn't always perfect and this movie symbolizes this sentence very well.<br/><br/>Ellen Page plays Juno, a weird high school girl full of sarcasm who realizes she's pregnant one day. Her b/f is a complete tool and she's obviously not fit for motherhood so she enlists a married couple (Jennifer Garner not holding a gun, wtf?? lol) to raise the child once it is born.<br/><br/>I have friends who have been pregnant before and they say most of the pregnancy situations in the movie were as they should be such as the tri-mesters, the bodily functions and especially the raging hormones though at severe as in 40 Year Old Virgin. I liked the sarcastic nature of the movie and it depicts how not everything is perfect in life. I liked how near the end Vannessa's (Jennifer Garner)husband takes off and she appears to raise the child on her own. In a cheesy movie, he'd make a comeback saying something like he's sorry and we all live happily ever after, but in the real world that wouldn't happen, hence the ending we were left with.<br/><br/>The only negative I have are how she was very mobile when close to berth, I have friends who say there was no way she could have reached in the back of her minivan the way she did in real life. Other than that all is well. Its sort of a chick flick but if you're an aspiring parent and appreciative of sarcastic humor then this movie is for you. The only other negative is the soundtrack makes me want to vomit up my intestines, but other than that check it out<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie is when Jennifer Garner asks if Juno if her parents care where she is and she answers ""I'm already pregnant so there's not much more shenanigans I can get into.<br/><br/>Not exactly a family comedy but good sarcastic humor and a great life lesson, its not perfect.<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

","""Juno"" is about many things: love, need, integrity, commitment, family, parenthood, sex, oh and a tiny 16 year old girl who finds herself pregnant in small town America.<br/><br/>If Ken Loach had made this kind of movie, I'd have been slitting my wrists by the 22nd minute, consumed with angst and the inevitable bleakness of the human condition.<br/><br/>But this is written by a woman who christened herself Diablo Cody and who manages her image like a Letterman monologue (she worked as stripper in preference to her job at an ad agency and has two wonderful quotes about writing and writers: Stripping toughened my hide, but exposing myself as a writer has been a lot more brutal.<br/><br/>I have never been an ambitious person, and my participation in this industry is a fluke, but only male writers can afford to be coy and self-deprecating.) so it is hip without being glib and optimistic without being candy-coated.<br/><br/>Just reading the script for this movie would have lightened my heart and stretched my smile but the movie adds indie music, cool animation, perfect timing, and an ensemble cast that take no prisoners. <br/><br/>And then there's Ellen Page. I'm more than a little in love with Ellen Page. She knows how to sell an emotion with small changes to her facial expression but she never seems to let technique get in the way of emotional honesty. Page is small, with a large head and a wide mouth and eyes that take in the whole world. She looks 16 (she was 20 when the movie was made) and, although she is brave and independent and almost compulsively witty, she carries across that only-partly-formed-and-still-very-vulnerable state that makes being a teenager so emotion soaked. <br/><br/>I first saw her last year in ""Hard Candy"" where she plays a 14 year old who thinks she encountered a internet predator and sets out to deal with him. I switched the movie off, not because it was bad but because it was so raw I couldn't cope with it.<br/><br/>I hope the movies does well at the Oscars. I wish Cody Diablo well with her up and coming ""United States of Tara"" series and I am absolutely certain that I will see every film that Elen Page takes part in."

I like the fact that the Academy in the past years suddenly put their look into some little and great productions like ""Sideways"", ""Lost in Translation"" and the last year in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" but i don't like the fact that in consequence of that attention the ""indie"" companies suddenly start to repeat the formula and the result is a film like this one that is enjoyable but it's a rip off all the past little films like ""Napoleon Dynamite"" or ""Ghost World"" but in a light version that can be in the theaters all around the world and ready for the nominations. The film contains somehow the style of ""Ghost World"" featuring a young but very intelligent girl who seems to be really disappointed with the world , the films of Jared Hess with all those great colors that we can watch too in other great director like Wes Anderson but in the end ""Juno"" is a very light comedy, nothing new and with the typical happy end that left everybody satisfied.<br/><br/>The cast is good but for me the performance of Ellen Page is really overrated by critics. The supporting cast is nothing special with Jennifer Garner and Michael Cera.<br/><br/>Conclsion: ""Juno"" is a good entertainment with some good things like the talks about films and music and it's true that there are some great dialogs but for me is nothing new.

"jpschapira","9","2","8","15 February 2008"," Not to miss...
","To begin with, I want to put things on the table with the comparisons. Because this decade, we've experienced cases like ""Juno""; films that grow with time and suddenly are Best Picture contenders for the Academy Awards. Well, ""Juno"" is better than ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and much better than ""Sideways""; it surpasses the latter one on comedic and dramatic levels and, although it doesn't have 'Sunshine's' dramatic power, it features a more prominent collection of scenes and it has a script that's impossible to beat. <br/><br/>I don't want to underestimate director Jason Reitman's delicate and inspiring job, but you can't deny there's something about Diablo Cody's first work that lies beyond explanation. If this writing seems more formal than usual, it's because Cody wrote the main character's lines with a noticeable level of superiority that is at the same time contradictory. Because Juno (Ellen Page) appears to know it all with the level of vocabulary I'm talking about, however when she gets pregnant she doesn't know what to do. <br/><br/>And that's not all. Sixteen-year-old girls call their friends 'dude'-or at least Juno is one of them-and she has her fair share of code words that even the wisest teenager in the room may have trouble understanding; not to mention the fact that she listens to really heavy rock music and she dresses almost like guy. Yes, she's a freak, but not with the glasses and the weird dresses she describes in one of the film's many funny scenes (Cody's wonderful script includes a non-traditional form of narration by Juno that works perfectly); she's very pretty.<br/><br/>When she discusses the reason of her pregnancy with her best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby), she mentions who the father is and makes obvious that she feels something for him. If you know comedy and romance, you will expect a certain number of exact, by heart phrases that the best friend would use in that moment. She uses none of them, and it's beautiful. So when we 'meet' the father in another great scene, we fully understand that Juno is 'special'. <br/><br/>Special as a couple; Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman in two fantastically unexpected portrayals) think she is, when they meet her because she wants to 'give' them her baby. That scene, how Juno constantly refers to the baby as ""the thing""; how she ends up playing the guitar with Mark; the rest of the scenes she shares with him in which, among other things, she tells him he's a big 'sellout'; and my favorite moment of the film are pieces of a well-rounded, multidimensional character we are not used to see in a comedy.<br/><br/>And Ellen Page? She hands in a masterclass; a bliss of understanding of character and of sheer honesty, a better performance than Julie Christie's in ""Away From Her"". She has that light; the light of a true talent; the light I saw when I first watched Winona Ryder in ""Reality Bites"" and made me want to watch all of her films (I have almost completed the task). And of course Page also has that look; the look that says ""this is no game"". When it comes to performance, this movie is hers and nobody else's. <br/><br/>And I haven't even mentioned the scene where she gives his father and stepmother (J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney), and how they react and the advices they give here in that moment and in so many others; or the multiple film references in Cody's script and the fact that it has clearly remained untouched. I really want to detail many scenes, but instead I'll just tell you which one's my favorite (there's plenty to choose), so you can pay attention: the moment near the end where one character's running and Juno walks to himThat moment, that scene. <br/><br/>It has been said, but the unchangeable truth is Reitman and Cody do something many movies try unsuccessfully these days: aim directly at the heartThey don't miss. I hope I said all I had to say."
"edchin2006","6","2","8","14 February 2008"," Do we need more ""feel good"" movies?
","Sure, a film about teenage pregnancy can be funny - I recall a film about a Nazi concentration camp being funny. I think the next candidate should be ""Youth in Asia"" (sound it out). Maybe it's beneficial to have ""feel good"" movies about serious issues, but to portray such a happy ending suggests that teenage pregnancy is a really rewarding and maturing experience. Even Benigni's ""La Vita è Bella"" doesn't suggest that being in a concentration camp is such a wonderful experience.<br/><br/>On second thought - there is a baby shortage. With so many couples seeking babies from abroad, a domestic supply could be useful. This could even be extended to other areas of shortage - a fun movie about soldiers in Afganistan might result in a rash of new recruits wanting to join the army to serve in Afganistan."

Juno's reaction to her new-found pregnancy was not believable. She acted as though it was 'no big deal' when in reality, it was and any teenage girl would agree.<br/><br/>For example, if you have seen 'Riding in Cars with Boys'; that reaction was flawless.

","Imagine having a baby when you're sixteen. Can't? Neither could Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page, HARD CANDY), a sassy and intelligent young girl who finds herself having to deal with this very issue in the highly acclaimed film JUNO.<br/><br/>Once the rabbit dies, Juno is forced to come to terms with what she must do. Telling and not telling various people becomes a challenge, as does deciding whether or not to terminate the pregnancy. Once she decides against abortion (after a hysterical scene in the clinic where tapping fingernails play an annoying part), Juno decides to tell those closest to her. This includes the would-be father Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera, SUPERBAD), a geekish track and field teen who's shocked to learn that his first time sexual encounter has also resulted in first time potential fatherhood, and her father Mac (J.K. Simmons, THE ASTRONAUT FARMER) and stepmother Bren (Allison Janney, HAIRSPRAY). Paulie seems equal parts embarrassed and elated (his seed has taken hold), while Juno's parents are dismayed, disappointed, but eventually supportive ...especially after they learn that she's decided to give up the baby to a couple that can't have kids (whom she finds advertising in the PennySaver).<br/><br/>The unborn's future parents are the Lorings, Vanessa (Jennifer Garner, THE KINGDOM) and Mark (Jason Bateman, SMOKIN' ACES). Vanessa is agog with the anticipation of motherhood, while her husband, Mark, is more pensive, unsure if he's ready to take the dive into daddydom.<br/><br/>The mixture of characters works well for the film with the only exception being that it was tough to swallow someone of J.K. Simmons' and Allison Janney's age being parents to a sixteen year old; they're a bit too old for those roles. Even so, the dialogue is stupendous, often making one forget that visual distraction and making them strain to catch every last nuanced syllable. And there are plenty.<br/><br/>Although there aren't many teens out there with the intellect that Juno possesses, that's exactly what makes this film so watchable. It touches on an unfortunately ordinary premise (teen pregnancy) but pulls it up to a whole new level by allowing us to see it through the eyes of someone (Juno) battling with self-recognition during an age-crucial time.<br/><br/>If there was ever any doubt that Ellen Page is one of the finest young actresses working in film today, Juno should put further arguments to rest. It is her razor-sharp line delivery that makes this film what it is: a character study of unusually funny proportions."

","When I first heard about this movie, I wasn't sure as to whether or not it would be good. I saw the previews and saw the attention it was getting, but I was still not sure. When I walked into the movie theater, I was still not sure. It wasn't until the first shot of the movie that I was impressed. After that, I was blown away. ""Juno"" centers on the story of a teenage girl named Juno (Ellen Page) who finds herself pregnant at the age of sixteen. She looks at ads in the paper and finds a couple who are in desperate need of a child, yet cannot get pregnant. While the plot line may seem very simple and short, the actual plot of the story is quite emotional, yet still humorous at the same time. The acting in this movie is completely suburb, as well as the direction, the writing, the lighting, the settings, etc. Of course, one large question that some people have is how does the film handle the fact that Juno gets pregnant. In my opinion, they actually handle it quite well. ""Juno"" is one of those movies where you think you know the outcome of it, and then it suddenly takes you by surprise. It's also one of those films that is, if anything, very underrated."
"Monotreme02","8","2","8","30 January 2008"," Charming, funny, sweet, and irresistibly entertaining
","Like most films in the genre, including most recently last year's Little Miss Sunshine, the actual story of Juno is surprisingly simple. Just as Little Miss Sunshine could best be described as a ""dysfunctional family's road trip"", Juno is about ""a teenage girl who gets pregnant and decides to keep the baby."" By keeping it simple and not assailing us with multiple story lines and side-tracking subplots, first-time writer Cody achieves something that many other major motion pictures fail to achieve, and that is creating a movie that is about its characters, and not about its story. And what wonderful characters they are. Cody provides us with an immensely attractive packaging, providing her characters with an ultra-quirky form of ""new-wave"" speech and having them, especially Juno and her best friend, speak in a manner that I think is safe to say nobody speaks in the real world we live in. Juno is starkly characterized as a very unique individual: sarcastic, frightfully open about her feelings, cynical, tom-boyish, impulsive, and many other such characterizations that make her truly a fantastic character to behold. All the other characters are similarly exaggeratedly characterized: Michael Cera's Paulie Bleeker's unprecedented naivety and sweetly geeky devotion; Jennifer Garner's Vanessa's crazed obsession; Jason Bateman's Mark's exceptional laid-back attitude; and more. But what Cody does that is truly remarkable is providing her characters with true, realistic, real-world emotions despite their over-the-top facades. As the film progresses, for instance, we go from simply admiring Juno's unique outward manner of behavior to truly and deeply caring for her; the same goes for the other characters as well. And I absolutely love how Cody shatters the teen film cliché of overbearing parents, and provides Juno with probably the most wonderfully compassionate and understanding parents in any teen movie, for example her father, J.K. Simmons' Mac, who instead of shunning her for her mistake instead immediately offer her their help and advice. I especially love how Allison Janney completely breaks the overbearing she-demon formula of stepmother characters and provides Bren with a truly kindly character who cares only for her stepdaughter's well-being, as seen in the brilliantly wonderful scene in the ultrasound clinic when she snaps at the technician for passing judgment on her stepdaughter's pregnancy.<br/><br/>Despite the immensely talented supporting cast, perhaps not quite reaching the bravura cast of Reitman's first feature film, Thank You For Smoking, but impressive all the same, there's no doubt in my mind that the true stunner, the brightest shining star is young Ellen Page. Her role as master manipulator in last year's Hard Candy was simply a prelude to her truly outstandingly immense talent as a multi-layered actress, which she showcases in full force as Juno MacGuff. It is a virtuoso performance to behold; Page manages to deliver Cody's undeniably complex and difficult dialogues with such pitch perfection, while still managing to retain the proper realism of a true, real-world teenage girl. Page allows all of Juno's compassion to show right through her showy, unique façade, and manages to create an incredibly fascinating film character while delivering one of the best performances of the year. And at just 20 years old, it is clear that Page has only good places to go from here, and hopefully this as her first major starring role will propel her career in the direction it deserves. I cannot wait to see what more she has to offer, because if she has this much talent at a young age, just imagine what can happen if she goes down the path of the likes of Kate Winslet or Jodie Foster, who both delivered fine performances at a young age and only got better from there.<br/><br/>But Cody and Page are not the only ones deserving of consummate admiration for their work in creating these characters and letting the true, real emotion and drama seep through the entertaining, quirky façade. It is, after all, the director who brings everything together and Jason Reitman seems the perfect choice. He's certainly building up a name for himself, what with two undeniably fantastic works of big-cast indie comedies now under his belt. In both works he does an admirable job of not taking center stage; his two films are as much his casts' and his writers' as they are his. No showy cinematography, no in-your-face direction, no gimmicks; Reitman manages the ever-so-difficult task in independent film of letting go of control and of ego and simply letting the wonderful source material exist and be portrayed in the absolutely best way possible.<br/><br/>It is a great and difficult task that pays off wonderfully when a film manages to emotionally and dramatically engage the viewer. It is even more admirable when a film manages to do this while at the same time be fantastically accessible; charming, funny, sweet, and irresistibly entertaining. Juno manages it all so wonderfully that it's an unprecedented pleasure of a film to watch: funny, engaging, quirky, interesting, but at the same time resonant, honest, compassionate, and truly, insightfully dramatic. Cody takes a simple real-world situation, puts it in a quirky indie-film fantasy world, but populates it with wonderfully true and sympathetic characters. Ultimately the film is about them; it's about Juno perhaps using her unusual, quirky façade to hide her true feelings; it's about Paulie's sweet, naïve devotion; it's about Vanessa's initially funny desperate obsession which we eventually understand is a beautiful desire to bring life to another person in the world; it's about Mark's wild, too-cool-to-conform attitude that eventually turns out to be an unfortunately juvenile lack of maturity; and it's about how all of these characters come together in a world of youth, impulse, beauty, love, hamburger phones and track runners."
"teresaband","10","2","8","30 January 2008"," Hilarious and heartwarming
","It's not often that a ""teen"" comedy comes along that treats teens like proper intelligent beings, as opposed to dance-obsessed nookie chasers. ""Juno"" is one of those rare movies about teenagers which is scripted with an incredible amount of wit and sass, shot with style and acted with warmth and charisma by a great cast who don't look like examples of identikit high school perfection. It tells the story of an unplanned teenage pregnancy and the effect it has on the girl in question, but it's far from your conventional approach to the subject. It's moving and heartwarming without ever resorting to sentimental mush, and hilariously funny without peeing on anyone or shagging any pies.<br/><br/>Ellen Page is a revelation, giving a hilarious and love-able performance, full of swagger and cynically barbed lines which should have you laughing into your popcorn so the drama can sneak up on you unawares. It's a brilliantly crafted and rounded performance in a film full of great turns and without a single weak link. It really is that good, and I can't recommend this absolute joy of a movie highly enough."
"eekeeley","9","2","8","25 January 2008"," See this movie, if for nothing else, Juno's parents
","I really enjoyed the film, both because it had some very funny moments and because it was lighthearted. Maybe it's not particularly realistic (I personally wouldn't know), but J.K. Simmons, and to a slightly lesser degree Allison Janney, make this film worth it.<br/><br/>Mac and Bren McGuff are the parents we all would love to have. They're funny, sarcastic, and yet at the same time supportive. While expressing their disappointment in Juno's decision-making, they allow her to make her own calls and help her through the situation, the entire time throwing in little barbs and comments. Maybe the average parent would scream and shout, but we should all strive to be like those two, able to have a sense of humor through a rotten situation. Bren's ability to support her step-daughter and call her her own throughout the film is a remarkable testament to a real family. Mac's gruff protectiveness is heartwarming. Only criticism I would have is that Liberty Bell seems almost non-existent.<br/><br/>Ellen Page's character brings a complexity to the pregnant teenager debate that is so absent too often. She is not acting out of some religious motivation or moral objection, at least not an overt one. This isn't a pro-choice/pro-life film either way. The religious right wouldn't trumpet it. She, after all, would give her baby to ""a couple of nice lesbos."" It is somewhat of a choice film, but not necessarily the one we associate with the debate. Rather, she wants to do this because on some fundamental level it's what's best for her, for whatever reason whether it's her conscience, her gut sense that this was meant to be, or whatever. But she also has no interest in the child long-term, and neither does the father. They ultimately want normal teenage lives. While the plot may seem very Lifetime, television for women, it has a richness no made for TV film ever has.<br/><br/>The dialogue really represents how we would like to be able to talk if we were that smart. Yes, it does get overwhelming at times, but in general it's very funny and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Bottom line, yay for a movie on this subject that is complex without being preachy either way."

","I liked this movie a lot. The quirkyness really made me laugh. It reminded me of Napoleon Dynamite some... mostly because I think that a lot of the dialog where inside jokes of somewhere that I've never been too yet. But that's okay, they were funny anyway. I hear a lot of boos on how the parents reactions aren't real enough. Mmm. I can say they probably are. I mean the father is retired military. And if you met any retired military (well non-wartime vets) you can probably see the similarity. They happen to be some of the relaxed people around. And the wives who marry them? Just the same. Juno's family reminded me a lot of my friends' families whose fathers were in the military. And the crap about Juno being self centered, well, come on. She's 16! Who wasn't self centered at that age. I found the movie to be really good. But to each their own right?"

","I just got through watching Juno tonight. I originally really liked the look of this but after reading some negative reviews and getting the impression it was another indie flick trying too hard to be quirky, my anticipation had dampened a bit.<br/><br/>I was certainly not disappointed. Juno is quirky, it is indie and it is a little tiny bit pretentious in bits. This does not spoil a lovely, warm, touching movie that leaves you with a smile on your face for a long time after the end credits have rolled.<br/><br/>Ellen Page was outstanding. She drew the viewer in with her funny, thoughtful and challenging portrayal of Juno. Michael Cera is pretty damn good as the geek (he plays this part so well in all his roles) and Junos father is outstanding also. I particularly liked the way her step mother was portrayed. There appears to be an element of jealously between them at the start, this is quickly replaced by a deep fondness of Juno by her step mother as she struggles to cope with the pregnancy.<br/><br/>I noticed so many little bits that I liked about this film. Sure it is predictable in places and it is overly quirky, but it leaves you feeling good - is that not what a film should do? Not the film of the year but a defo must see.

If you have to pick one movie this year to see, JUNO should be it. Ellen Page was an exceptional casting for the role of Juno MacGuff as a sardonic 16 year-old girl who finds out she is pregnant by Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). All of the dialogue in this film was entertaining. I laughed through the whole movie, and so did the rest of the audience.<br/><br/>The soundtrack to this film is awesome.

I'd missed seeing it at the Austin Film Festival by 20 minutes (again, another road trip) and was crushed. This time we were three hours early and it was totally worth it. I'd never been to a promotional screening before, but I can't wait to do it again. My friends and I took up an entire row in the theater. Awesome, right? God, I'm rambling...on to the actual review.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, the first 15 minutes were killer - the music, the animation, the opening line. People were laughing so loudly, I missed most of the dialogue. In fact, this is true for about 30% of the movie. If you see this movie once, you'll have to see it again to really appreciate Diablo's writing. However, it doesn't take a second look to realize how incredible Ellen Page is as Juno. Having seen some of her other work, it's as if she takes every character she plays and gives them a piece of herself. Therefore, making everyone who sees Juno fall in love with her.<br/><br/>This film is a must see to anyone who...well, anyone. The script, the director, the cast. It all works."

","What an experience to see a film so well written and acted. Ellen Page captures the character of Juno with a depth that makes her quirkiness and dialogue believable. Not your typical 16-year-old, as stereotypes go. But isn't that the point of great films--to present us with characters that are not stereotypical? Allison Janney was fabulous as Juno's stepmother and the actor playing the role of Juno's father added humor and warmth to the portrayal of a concerned father. Michael Cera played the part as only he could have, with a mixture of concern, insecurity, and honesty. From the screenplay to the casting to the actual acting, this is a very memorable movie."

","This well-reviewed film left me somewhat cold. It's a pleasant enough comedy about teenage pregnancy, with some whippy lines; but none of them really cut very hard. There's a drippy soundtrack, a geeky guy who the smart-alec girl eventually falls for (note that you very see films that work the other way around), and a fairly shallow portrait of emotional and family life. Director Reitman previously made 'Thank You For Smoking', which was right-wing and facetious, but which at least tried to make you think: this movie is frankly soft by comparison. Even one-liners are funniest when they come from the heart; but although the characters talk about heartbreak, none of them act like they know what it means."

","I finally got around to watching this movie out of sheer boredom and the lack of anything else on cable that night. I actually watched it twice in the hopes of finding some redeeming parts or some degree of depth. I have to admit that Jennifer Garner managed to capture perfectly the uptight desperation of the mid to late-30's childless woman. Jason Bateman did a reasonably good job of playing the soon to be railroaded into fatherhood husband. Otherwise, the whole ""don't blink or you'll miss some snappy dialogue"" is completely overdone. The entire premise of the all knowing, mature beyond her years ubercool teen getting pregnant is completely implausible. A completely over-rated film."
"alexis_240","4","2","9","1 July 2008"," Funny, but there's nothing here that deserves an Oscar
","This film, even though it's quite sweet and genuinely funny at times, is deeply flawed and its nomination for the best picture award was an insult to the academy. Juno is not really much more than a totally forgettable teenage movie about a too cool to be true 16 old girl (Juno, played by Ellen Page) who gets pregnant.<br/><br/>The problems are pretty evident from the very beginning. Once Juno learns she is pregnant she tells her apparently closest female friend. She then pointlessly carries a circular shaped rug and a chair in front of her boyfriend's (Bleeker, played by Michael Cera), and father of the child, house and sits on it waiting for him to come out. Couldn't she just stand and wait? The presence of the chair, rug and an annoying pipe which Juno inexplicably loves shoving in her mouth, do not make much sense. The film seems to suffer from an overwhelming desire to impress. Later on when Juno along with Leah (played by Olivia Thirlby) are looking at adoption adverts in the papers, they're both wearing dark shades (how they managed to read with those on is beyond me, given the fact that it was hardly sunny) and Juno has this damn pipe in her mouth again.<br/><br/>Other than this desire to impress, one of the sources of my negative attitude towards this movie is that it takes something as serious as teenage pregnancy and turns it into an about 92 minute farce. Not a single character seems to ask Juno why in God's name she found it so hard to buy those rubber things that answer to the name of condoms which could have spared her the misery of having a child at 16. In addition the character of Juno is very hateful, has no regard for others, and seems to be amazingly dumb. She wonders why everyone at school is staring at her, let me guess, could it be the bloated belly which indicates her pregnancy only at 16 years of age? Maybe it's that she's sitting in the award frame (when she and Leah are having lunch) surrounded by scraps of snack paper. It's this right-in-your-face stupidity that makes the film more annoying than it naturally is.<br/><br/>Secondly Juno suggests that Bleeker asks Katrina Devort (another female classmate) to the prom, if my memory doesn't fail me, and gets very mad at him when he does so. There's a nice stable person. She gets surprised to find herself pregnant after having unprotected sex (is this a joke?), gets mad at Bleeker when she was actually the one who initiated the sex act and then again has a fight with him when the only thing he did was take the advice she freely offered. On top of all that Juno is just not believable, hardly anybody talks the way she does and as I've already said, she's far too cool to be true. Personally I don't buy it. Maybe well written but unrealistic and it makes a mockery of teenage pregnancy.<br/><br/>And as if all the above was not enough, there is one particular sequence I find extremely offensive and ridiculous. This is when Juno is having her ultrasound along with her step mom (played by Allison Janney) and Leah. Brenda (the step mom) decides to verbally abuse the ultrasound technician because she dared to suggest that a teenage mother would provide a very poisonous environment for the baby to grow up in. In other words she spoke nothing but the truth and in return she got abused by a less educated woman who (the way I see it) is still struggling to accept her teenage stepdaughter's pregnancy. Juno on the other hand suggests that the adoptive parents could be psychos for all they know (yeah right, of all the possible scenarios this is the most likely). There doesn't seem to be much point in this scene other than it being a test of Allison Janney's speed of dialog. It's not a very good message to take home to kids either: it's alright to get pregnant as a teenager because you never know; you could make a good parent.<br/><br/>Jennifer Garner (Vanessa) and Jason Bateman (Mark) are the only characters that appear convincing. Vanessa wants a baby very badly whereas Mark is not sure and thinks there are still things he wants to do. Even though Mark is immature and chases nothing but adolescent fantasies (at 40) he admits it at least. Both Mark and Vanessa do look like a genuine couple having a conflict.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, Juno is an extremely annoying movie because of both the dialog and its unrealistically flippant portrayal of teenage pregnancy. Humor is nice but can't be used in dealing with pregnancy. Juno's condition can leave an indelible stain on her record, yet everyone keeps telling dumb jokes never giving it the seriousness it deserves. Juno again is hateful, selfish and totally unrealistic.<br/><br/>Juno is just another teenage movie pretty much like the garbage that was American pie, except it's not about sex but about pregnancy. It's nothing that will be remembered but still it delivers a few laughs. However it's more about 'growing up and the inevitable pregnancies along the way' than 'growing up and the bumps along the way."
"imajestr","4","2","9","20 April 2008"," Overrated
","From Ellen Page overacting one moment to the next, to each indie song every time there's a scene change, to the pretentious dialogue, this movie's tries so hard to be special and charming that it comes off as a sham. None of it feels genuine. It's as if someone who's seen a countless amount of so-called ""indie"" flicks said to herself, ""That looks easy, I can write pretentious dialogue all day!"" I don't really understand the hype, but nothing I can say will make people realize how overrated this film is. Even my girlfriend was raving about it when she saw it, but I was antsy and bored when she made me watch it recently. It gets mildly interesting about twenty minutes before the end, but other than that it's like watching some corporate Hollywood executive's attempt at making an ""indie"" film. If you don't mind watching annoying girls banter on for an hour and a half, then rent this one, but if you're looking for a real comedy or drama that doesn't annoy, I'd skip it.<br/><br/>I don't really understand why Ellen Page got so much attention. Her excited stutter-speak becomes so tedious by the end I wanted to reach through the screen and smack her. You can predict how she's going to deliver lines by the end in an attempt to make them sound natural, but it gets highly annoying. Not to mention her character is not likable at all.<br/><br/>The music is another issue. Why every ""indie"" film needs to discuss bands at length like it adds something to the plot, I will never understand. Not to mention this whole movie is more like a music video for The Moldy Peaches.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm not in touch with my feminine side or something, but I just don't get what all the rave is about."

There's got to be some nice couple out there needing a baby. Sure, there is, Vanessa and Graham, the seemingly perfect Yuppie Couple who've advertised in the Pennysaver. Dad (JJ Simmons) and Step Mum Brenda (Allison Janney) are warmly supportive, but of course things don't quite go to plan.<br/><br/>This film is of course the little movie that could, a US $3m movie that grossed $70 million in four weeks (alas, mostly for Rupert Murdoch's Fox Searchlight company). It caused quite a stir  just look at the message board on this website, there are 5000 posts at least. It's nice it is so popular because it's well-scripted (by first timer Diabolo Cody), well acted and generally cheerful to watch. At the same time it dodges the ""long term"" issue  the effect on a birth mother of separation from her child, and for that matter the effect on the child.<br/><br/>Emily Page, helped by the sparkling script, is terrific, and I really enjoyed Alison Janney (""CJ"" in West Wing"") as the definitely not wicked stepmother. Jason Reitman proved he can do quirky comedy in Thank You for Smoking and shows it again here. We might have teenage sexuality house trained but accidents are still going to happen. To me, adoption outside the family circle, noble as it may be, is ""second best"" parenting, and should only be resorted to where there is no real alternative. As for abortion, well I'm pro-choice, but that includes saying no as well as yes.<br/><br/>It's interesting that this movie was shot in British Columbia, with a Canadian actress in the lead. Maybe it was cheaper, or maybe it was to forestall pro-lifer demonstrators (who are not always as charming as the one in the film).

","If you haven't seen Juno, you are missing out on a great movie. At first you might be a little put off by the quick and quirky dialog, thinking that no one speaks this way, however at about ten minutes in you ease up and go with it - or at least I did.<br/><br/>Juno is not your typical teen pregnancy film, it is really a coming of age story about a girl looking for herself. This movie is full of life and only stops once for judgment when an ultrasound technician makes a snide remark only to be quickly deflated by Juno's stepmother Brenda, played by Allison Janney. Instead the film focuses on laughs and love - two things that are delivered differently than any other film I have seen.<br/><br/>The love story is really secondary to the film and creeps in only once in awhile, but it is an undercurrent that really becomes evident towards the end of the film. When Juno finds herself, she quickly realizes her love for her impregnator - Paulie Bleaker. The film also focuses on different kinds of love - self love, parental love, friendship and so on.<br/><br/>The laughs come from a great script written by Diablo Cody and are delivered by an impeccable cast. Michael Cera who plays Paul Bleaker is understated yet incredibly real and funny. Go see this movie. I hear it is up for some well deserved Golden Globes.<br/><br/>By Chris Kubbernus Junoverse ID# 866"

","It's a scenario that's been the fodder for countless romantic comedies, teen comedies, and made-for-TV dramas on Lifetime: a young woman gets pregnant, usually unexpectedly, and has to deal with the pressures of becoming a reluctant mother. While ""Juno"" does indeed present itself as such, the film quickly and ingeniously shows a slightly comical fluffy side that allows the film to not only deal with sensitive material intelligently and maturely, but we can also have a little fun and a good laugh along the way, too.<br/><br/>Juno MacGuff (played with wonderful wit and sass by Ellen Page), is the 16-year-old title character who gets pregnant following an impromptu liaison with her would-be boyfriend and high school track runner Paulie Bleeker (the fragile Michael Cera, still riding the ""Superbad"" wave). Juno at first decides to ""nip this thing in the bud"" and get an abortion. But right away, ""Juno"" removes itself from the morally black & white abortion area when she does go to the clinic, and decides not to go through with it because ""babies have fingernails."" Fingernails!<br/><br/>Juno ultimately decides that she's going to have the baby and then give it up for adoption to a loving childless couple - Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) - after seeing their ad in a flier. But first she has to break the news to her pop (J.K. Simmons) and step-mom (Allison Janney) who are just thankful she's not on drugs or didn't get expelled from school. (Fundamentals will ask, ""Where are the parents?"") But they're not absent or irresponsible parents, they're just along for the ride. Surely enough, Juno gets big (and I mean, big!) as she takes this pregnancy thing in stride. She gets mocked at school by her classmates and ugly looks from her teachers. All the while, we get to see Juno deal with her pregnancy in some greatly comic and offbeat fashions.<br/><br/>""Juno"" is a breath of fresh air in the tried and tired ""unplanned mommy"" genre. It's coming to us with a smart-alecky script written by the provocative Diablo Cody that was directed by Jason Reitman (son of Ivan). Cody's screen writing goes to all the most unusual places and doesn't play games with a teenage girl's fragile predicament. Even though the film may initially come off as some lame drama (there are plenty of heartfelt moments here), it's easy to lose sight of the fact that first and foremost, this is a comedy - a comedy about growing up, the bumps along the way, and the choices we also make along the way. I found myself laughing along with plenty of other theater-goers at some of the witty dialogue and laugh-out-loud funny moments, all planted firmly in Cody's expertly written screenplay.<br/><br/>But ""Juno"" belongs squarely to Ellen Page, if this is her breakout performance. Already a shining young actress on the rise (I best remember her as Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat from ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" back in 2006; I never saw ""Hard Candy""), she plays Juno as a decisive, clear-headed, sharp-tongued young woman who makes decisions as she sees fit, as they come her way, because it's clear to her that she's not ready to become a mother. I already stated that she's a sassy young woman here, and that sass also gets her some of the movie's best and funniest lines. I also mentioned the ""fingernails"" line, but after she aborts her abortion, there's a sharply-written sequence of dialogue where she says to the Lorings if they've ever considered adoption from China, because ""they give babies away like free iPods."" I laughed out loud at that one, even if it sounds a little too politically-incorrect.<br/><br/>""Juno"" - it's the little movie that could, the little-movie-that-could that you least expected to love.<br/><br/>10/10"
"reelinspiration","9","2","9","2 January 2008"," Why is Juno one of the Best Films of 2007?
","Once you get past the ""clever"" over previewed dialog, you'll find a very honest and original story in Juno. It has one of the truest portrayals of ordinary teens in years. What could have been another morality tale is handled with matter of fact honesty and humor. If only we could all have such supportive (and funny) family and friends! The acting sets exactly the right tone. Ellen Page is right on as the sarcastic (or is it honest) Juno. She was the one member of the cast to be nominated for an Independent Spirit Award. But the rest of the ensemble is equally good. Michael Cara's naturalistic and effortlessly funny performance also deserves a nod. Not to mention Juno's parents played by Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons. Jennifer Garner and Jason Batemen are fun to watch as the potential adoptive parents.<br/><br/>Don't let the over played trailer or all the hype discourage you from seeing this movie. There's much more there than what's shown in the trailer. (Isn't that a refreshing change!) I chose Juno to be on my ""Best Films of 2007"" list at: Reelinspiration dot Blogspot<br/><br/>Movie blessings! Jana Segal, Reel Inspiration"
"zbyszek111","10","2","9","1 January 2008"," Best Movie of 2007
","I have seen the other major Oscar contenders, Atonement and No Country For Old Men and Juno is better than those films. Ellen Page gives a legendary performance. You fall in love with her character in the first 10 minutes and then feel every emotion that she feels the rest of the movie. This is absolutely brilliant acting and I don't remember any other actress that has ever done this. In short the movie is about a 16 year old girl who gets pregnant and that is all you basically need to know without spoiling it for you. Even a 60 year old man who has nothing to relate to this movie should watch this movie to witness a great performance by Ellen Page. This brilliant movie is for everyone and I strongly recommend it."
"fgoworderup","10","2","9","1 January 2008"," Truly....well....BEAUTIFUL!
","Juno....what can be said. Going into this movie, I had no expectations other than having enjoyed the trailer. Walking out of the movie, I had high expectations for this film's future, and for a couple of reasons. First of all, is the acting. Ellen Page leads the way with amazing strength in her first real leading role of her career. She is followed up by some terrific not-so-famous actors, other than Michael Cera who brings his innocent seeming personality to the table like he did in Superbad. Second is the writing. Diablo Cody was formerly a pole dancer but soon after throwing that life away, she wrote her first script...Juno, and I'm so glad she did. Cody's vulgar/teen or young adult humor is unbelievably compassionate, a sign that not many writers possess anymore, and we are so lucky to have another rising star like Cody on the way. She shows the imperfect speaking of regular day teens and parents perfectly by using some snappy and uproarious one liners and well thought out statements. Lastly, the music and production. This movie is independent, and seems somewhat so, with a fantastic director to play things along at just the right pace and great timing, and although the directing was not so important here as in let's say...Transformers, it was still done extremely well. The music is also so beautiful. I'm a boy, but i'm not afraid of saying this, but the music is cute, fun, and truly beautiful...magnificently and unbelievably beautiful. BOTTOM LINE: THE TRULY AMAZING ACTING, WRITING FROM DIABLO CODY, AND PRODUCTION/MUSIC, MAKE THIS FILM ONE OF THE BEST OF THE YEAR. THE GREATEST FEEL GOOD FILM OF THIS DECADE. ELLEN PAGE, THE WRITING, AND THE MUSIC....TRULY...WELL...BEAUTIFUL! See it....there is no doubt in my mind that you will love it."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","2","9","29 December 2007"," Great Juno
","As ""Juno"" opens, Juno MacGuff played by Ellen Page downs a gallon of Sunny D, while lamenting the chair where it all started. Juno is filling up, so she can verify a drug store pregnancy testfor the third time. Director Jason Reitman's ""Juno"" catches you completely off guard in a bitter sweet and moving tale about living with life choices. ""Juno"" is perhaps the best movie of the year. Reitman also directed the excellent ""Thank You for Smoking"". With ""Juno"" the same wit shines along with a touching humanity. ""Juno"" is so smart, maybe a bit too smart at times with the crisp and biting dialog of Diablo Cody's amazing screenplay. Even some of the smartest people around, don't routinely create such stinging rifts. Regardless, the effect is hysterical as ""Juno"" celebrates the best in people. The greatest thing in life is when the people closest to you surprise you with their loyalty, compassion, and love. Yes, ""Juno"" is about a pregnant 16 year-old girl out to correct an error in judgment. However, it is not about the pregnancy itself, rather who the people become as they step up or not.<br/><br/>Applaud ""Juno"" for being very smart, embodied by the heroine Juno played by the remarkable Ellen Page. After Juno tells her father Mac (J.K. Simmons) and step mom Bren (Alison Janney), that she is pregnant and the father is Bleeker (Michael Cera), she confesses to her Dad, ""I really don't know what kind of girl I am."" The punch line is that her parents expected it. Bren admits that she was hoping the issue was that Juno was expelled or she was ""into hard drugs"". Ellen Page is awesome, and deserves an Oscar nomination. She is brilliant. She personifies Juno as this very smart and smart ass-ed kid who makes a mistake, and takes a responsible course of action. In a wonderful moment Bren (Janney) cautions the ultrasound technician to mind her judgment, because even her ""stupid ass step daughter"" could raise her child, but she has wisely chosen to give the baby a more capable couple.<br/><br/>Juno finds the ideal couple: Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). Juno located Mark and Vanessa in a PennySaver ad. Juno and her Dad meet the Lorings' and their attorney. Juno is a little chagrinedshe would like to ""kick this old school"" with the baby basket and Moses river deal. Mark and Vanessa seem the ""Stepford"" couple. However, fissures in their relationship are exposed. Vanessa (Garner) seems wound a few degrees too tighteven for type A. Her desire to be a mother is all consuming and humorless. Mark (Bateman) is the cool and supportive husband, but unhappy just below the surface. He composes music for commercials. He and Juno, also a wannabe guitarist, form a friendship.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Juno is a pregnant 16 year-old making it through high school on her resounding spirit and smarts. This soon is not enough. She wonders what will happen with her and Bleeker (Cera). The Lorings' are not what she expected, too. There is the wonderful conversation Juno has with her Dad, ""Why can't two people stay together forever?"" This is hysterical and touching all at the same timean epiphany for Juno and the audience. Ultimately, Juno is about finding true love and copping when it is gone. In a great line Juno says, ""He is the cheese to my macaroni."" Rietman is natural and understated in his direction. All the performances are compelling and amazing. T.K. Simmons is the perfect Dad, who keeps surprising with his irreverent compassion and strength. Alison Janney is awesome. Her Bren is smart, funny, and unexpectedly loyal to Juno. Michael Cera gets the right balance of geek and big hearted. Jason Bateman is greathe is subtle in his charm and suffering. Jennifer Garner is a total surprise playing against type. Her Vanessa is nearly insufferable, but Garner imposes her humanity that transcends the taut character. There is a moving scene where she feels Juno's baby kick. Ellen Page is vulnerable, smart, and hysterical. Page is an amazing actor. She completely captivates ""Juno"".<br/><br/>""Juno"" is one of the year's best. ""Juno"" refreshingly and humorously tells a story of the very best in people as they step up in life, and of true love. Definitely see ""Juno"" and be surprised."
"PatrickQRS","10","2","9","26 December 2007"," ""Thundercats are GOOOO!""
","This film has been nothing less then the hype of the independent film world this year. I have heard it called ""2007's Little Miss Sunshine"" and seen reviews titled ""Teenage Comedy with Merit, Who Knew?"" Well I am a sucker for good indie buzz, so of coarse I was drawn to Juno like a June bug to a screen door on a hot summer evening. After finally seeing it after all of the buzz, it is safe to say that it lives up to every bit of the hype. I would as well rank this up there, or even better then films like Little Miss Sunshine.<br/><br/>The acting was fantastic, in particular the delivery of Juno MacGuff that was so eloquently portrayed by Ellen Page. I remember the first time I watched her in Hard Candy, she pulled of in my opinion the most sadistic character in independent film today and I remember saying to myself ""This actress is going somewhere."" Jennifer Garner was wonderful as the uptight nervous adoptee to be. Jason Bateman pulled off the jerk man-child character wonderfully. Last but not least Michael Cera was wonderful as Paulie Bleeker, the boy that accidentally got his girlfriend pregnant, not knowing exactly how to react to the situation at hand. Not to forget the rest of the wonderful cast. From Juno's wonderfully accepting dad, to her menstrual mom, to Paulie Bleeker's ""hobbit mom."" the full cast could not have been better.<br/><br/>With the indie buzz, I am also a sucker for a good film controversy. Any film that spurs up any controversy, gets my blood pumping. I always have to go and see ""what the big deal is"" and realize that most people are way off base and are not watching the movie as a movie. Obviously, the controversy behind this film is rooted in teen pregnancy. Controversy like this always amuses me because it seems that people would rather ignore parts of society, then face the cold hard truth. No one will dispute that teen pregnancy is a problem. However dismissing any film for any difficult content is just wrong, and completely unjustified. If you would like to believe that films about teen pregnancy, along with other social problems should not be made because they are a problem in society then go live in your happy world in ignorance. However let us enjoy this terrible, terrible world in peace. This film was nothing but beautiful, it was not about a 16 year old messing up her life, and the life of a child. No, it was about her being responsible and making the world for an unable mother. This does not glorify teen pregnancy, if anything it shows the true value of adoption and family. Also, the film was blatant to the idea that Juno would be an unfit mother.<br/><br/>Without spoiling this film for everyone, just know that this is a beautifully witty yet serious film. It is a refreshing work and truly unique. I say refreshing because it is a teen film, that breaks away from that stigma of stupid humor of sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Instead this is a film of intellectual humor, and jokes with merit! I think we can look forward to where these young actors and actresses are going, I know I sure am excited. <br/><br/>I tried to keep this review short, and to the point without spoiling anything for anyone. This is a great film that I would say is for everyone. Except of coarse those uptight jaded folks that cannot handle a little taboo.<br/><br/>Hands down 10/10."

","One of the main reasons I take great delight in watching the movie ""Juno"" is simply because, the lead, Juno is a chick who can make cracks at life. It's about damn time that a movie came out in which a chick was just ""real"" and funny as hell. Yes, guys can be vulgar,nerdy and funny, but my girl, Juno, steps it up for the ladies out there! Woot woot! As a vulgar humors gal, myself, I love how Juno is chill about mentioning sexual connotations and her blunt yet reserved humor. Also her tendency to be slightly eccentric is always fun. She has a good grip on who she is, although, like any girl going though puberty, encounters moments of self doubt. Although teachers and students at her high school perceived her as promiscuous, Juno was never portray as a ""slut"". ""Juno"" really focuses on a girl who is just trying to get by during one of the most awkwardly hormonal times in life, Highschool.<br/><br/>Junoverse ID# 2746"

Not only is this cast amazing but the chemistry was phenomenal!! Michael Cera and Ellen Page are complete magic and definitely a force to be reckoned with. I've been a fan of almost everyone in this film for years. Wow, I just can't even believe how much I love this film. The wit was splendid with some tremendously touching moments.

","Oh do I love Ellen Page. She might barely be over 5 feet and 100 pounds but she is so good at what she does. I can't believe she is only 20. She is already so well polished.<br/><br/>Alright, I'll stop ranting on Ms. Page and talk about the movie. I've waited for Juno for almost 4 months after seeing the trailer. The humor looked dry but very clever and seemed to be right up my ally. I finally got to see it in late December and the movie became my Christmas present. I saw is at a 12:20 showing. My friend and I loved it so much that we came back later that night and saw it again! I plan on seeing it at least two more times so i can break my record of seeing a movie (prviously held by Borat and Jackass 2).<br/><br/>The movie starts off with Juno (played incredibly by Ellen Page) staring off like she got hit in the head with a brick. She then walks to a convenient store (I loved the animation for the opening credits) to grab a pregnancy test (for all you office fans, Rain Wilson has a small part) and pray that she isn't pregnant. Obviously from the trailer you find out she is pregnant. She tells the news to her best friend Paulie Bleeker who she experimented with sex with and his face is priceless. She gets lots of support form her dad and step mom and her best friend Leah (played by newcomer Olivia Thirlby). Unlike most 16 year olds, the news of being pregnant didn't really upset Juno very much. She has a plan as she wants to give away the baby for adoption to newly weds Vanessa and Mark Loring (played very well by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman). Is this the right decision? Everyone contributed very well in this film including even the smallest supporting roles. So much humor in the movie that was brilliant written my another newcomer, Diablo Cody. The movie is so original - perhaps the closest comparison is Napolean Dynamite and Knocked up but the movie has so much more sept to it. Jason Reitman was great in directing Thank You for Smoking but even better in Juno. He's got a very successful career coming his way.<br/><br/>The beauty of this film is how it stuck with me. Ellen's portrayal is so right on that I can't stop thinking about her. It's almost like I know her myself. Ellen Page should win best actress this year but probably won't as she wasn't even nominated for her brilliant performance in Hard Candy. Diablo Cody should win best screenplay and don't be surprised if Jennifer Garner grabs a nomination for her very good supporting role. The movie is unpredictable and you'll laugh hard and the constant fun but at the same time will want to cry at the heartbreaking moments.<br/><br/>I don't think I'll see a better movie this year."

","My sister and brother-in-law went to see a free screening of Juno in the end of November. That night, they called my younger sister and I to tell us of Juno's wonder. They told us that we simply had to see it, and we immediately found a free screening in our area. It was for December 20th and we were excited. We drove two hours to meet up with our older sister and her husband, and then drove straight to the theater. We had to sit in the third row, but it was well worth it. We never once noticed we were sitting in the front. The movie was so enthralling that nothing else really mattered. The movie kept our attention the entire time. The emotions swung you along with them, and the whole movie was just perfect. It's rare that movies of this scale are made nowadays, and my younger sister and I were simply blown away. The music was wonderful, the actors were excellent, the whole story and message were simply incredible. Everything about the movie made the trip well worth it. Now, we can't wait to see it again... and again... and again."

It has not been a great year (or a few great years) for Hollywood, and I have been so consistently disappointed in films that it was such a relief and an amazingly refreshing experience seeing Juno this past weekend. I loved it! The acting is superb. All the characters are spot on and real - not contrived like they are in most films. The dialog is funny and very well written, and the story is poignant and heart-felt. Everyone from the writer, to the director to the actors should be commended and should be very proud of this project. And what a year for Michael Cera!

Buck up and have the procedure. Just because you have a kid and then hand it over to someone else to raise, doesn't mean you've done the world or anyone any favors.

","Well, for a typical coming-of-age film, the quality of script and acting performances almost decide everything. And for this particular one, both the script and performances are noticeable, just as those from other brilliant coming-of-age films, such as The Edge of Seventeen, The Spectacular Now, Lady Bird, and so on. The casting is the base for the performances, which is also pretty well done. The most distinct feature of this film lies in the slight twist in plot and the novel topic, pregnancy for high school teenagers."

I really enjoyed watching Juno because it deals with real life issues that could apply to me some day (dodgy relationships) unlike the action/horrors iv,e been watching which teach you nothing,and I mean Nothing.

"deaconjohnwinstonsalem","10","1","3","23 July 2016"," A ""Must See"" For Family-oriented Adults
","""Juno"" is a ""must see"" for any person over 40 who is interested in ""the human condition."" Before I explain why, I must emphasize that this is a very wholesome movie.<br/><br/>Even though there is a ""sex"" scene, it is not in the slightest bit prurient or pornographic; it is ""tastefully done."" It fits into the natural flow of the movie; the over-all message would be less without it. I would not have hesitated to take any of my three daughters or their girlfriends to see it when they were 16-18. (All my children are over 30 now. They are all married and have children of their own.) <br/><br/>Here are some examples of the kind of insights into (or questions about) the human condition the movie has to offer. In the movie itself, these examples go by pretty fast; they are little sidelights to the main plot. Hopefully my comments will encourage you both to see the movie, and to increase your enjoyment of it when you do see it.<br/><br/>1) Juno's Asian classmate, Su-Chin, is picketing the abortion clinic. Previously pictured as a mousy type, it is a pleasant surprise to find out she is quite spunky.<br/><br/>In real life, do not people often turn out to have admirable hidden qualities when you get to know them better? <br/><br/>2) Su-Chin says many things to Juno at the abortion clinic, but the one that stuck was, ""It already has fingernails."" <br/><br/>Isn't it amazing how such tiny things often to be the ""swingers"" when we are making a big decision? <br/><br/>Or, maybe our subconscious focuses the attention of our consciousness on such trivia as a kind of distraction so that we will hurry up and do what our subconscious wants us to do? <br/><br/>3) The comments of the adult MacGuffs (Bren and Mac) show great insight into Juno's situation. AND, Bren and Mac are totally on Juno's side. Not wanting to exert too much control on the one hand, wanting things to go as smoothly as possible for Juno, on the other hand. (J.K.Simmons performance as Mac was outstanding, BTW.) <br/><br/>Does not God often give ""special wisdom"" to parents to help them raise their children?<br/><br/>When Juno is not there, Mac says to Bren, ""I wonder whose idea it was""? Bren says, ""We know whose idea it was."" Mac and Bren know Juno better than she knows herself, and they care about her. Far more than Juno is able to comprehend.<br/><br/>Do not our own parents often grow wiser as we get older? Or is it us who are becoming more aware of the wisdom, and love, that they had all along?<br/><br/>4) Late in the film, Juno blunders her way into an uncomfortable situation in the middle of the Loring's marriage. One of the MacGuffs comments, ""Juno doesn't understand about marriage."" Yep, Juno did not understand the dangerous road she was walking because she did not understand about marriage. <br/><br/>I've been married 49 years and have 12 grandchildren. And yet, how much do I really understand about marriage? Almost nothing compared to what there is to understand.<br/><br/>In fact, Juno would have been better off not knowing what she found out (IMO). How often would we be better off not knowing something that we know about another person? <br/><br/>5) Juno's attitudes are SO typical of 16-18 year old girls. For example, ""I want to find somebody really cool like an architect or interior designer to parent my child."" And yet, successful people in those professions are often too wrapped up in themselves to make good parents. You want to find somebody with the time, the resources, and the desire to be a good parent. Juno lucked out; she found Jennifer.<br/><br/>16-18 year old girls seemed much wiser to me when I was a teenager than they did when I was the Father of three of them.<br/><br/>6) Another example. In this show it is Bleeker who is the sensitive one, the more mature one, the more respectful and loyal one; the one who is ""pining away"" while Juno keeps him at arm's length throughout most of the movie. And yet, Bleeker is completely masculine; he is not a ""whimp."" Young (teenage) people, both men and women are so much alike in real life. In popular and media stereotypes, the young woman is often the one who is ""pining away."" <br/><br/>It is thought provoking to see our stereo types challenged. And in Bleeker, they are challenged in an inspiring and awe provoking way.<br/><br/>7) Another example. For the whole show, Bleeker is ""head over heels"" in love with Juno, and Juno feels the same way about him. However, it is not until near the very end of the movie that she even has a clue how he feels about her. Not until he says, ""I think you're beautiful,"" and she replies, with great surprise, ""You do?"" <br/><br/>Is not this unawareness of relationships typical of many young people? <br/><br/>8) Juno thinks that she is not physically attractive, although she is very attractive. Is this not typical of many young women today? <br/><br/><ul><li>- - - - </li></ul><br/><br/>The bottom line is that the movie is not so much about teenage pregnancy as it is about the give and take of family life. The movie uses the pregnancy of a particular teenage as a platform from which to offer very positive and hopeful insights into the Human Condition.<br/><br/>Enough. Words can not do it justice. If you are over 40, and you are interested in people, you just HAVE to see it.<br/><br/>Deacon John"

","The cinematography and colours were quite good and the dialogue somewhat accurately portray the way teenagers speak, and the composition of the shots are quite appealing - perhaps typical of such a high-budget modern movie.<br/><br/>However, the message of this film is rather stomach-churning: Teenage pregnancy is undeniably an important social issue and this film appears to trivialize it - Bearing a child at the age of 16 and yet everything turns out happy and fine. Not a very good influence, is it?<br/><br/>A good movie for a lighthearted Saturday night viewing but not something particularly memorable or worth such high acclaim."
"ggiannini93","7","1","3","22 October 2013"," Juno review
","""Juno"" is a funny, down-to-earth comedy-drama about a 16-year-old girl who gets pregnant by accident. It is Ellen Page who plays this strong-minded main character while Michael Cera gets to act as the young guy she slept with. The movie shows us the life of a normal, yet very independent young girl whose life totally changes over the news that she got pregnant. It starts with the act itself (although we do not see anything) between her and ""Paulie Bleeker"", a sort of nerdy guy she's good friends with. After understanding she was actually pregnant, she starts thinking about her options. The choice is hard but she finally decides to keep the baby but give it to what seems to be the perfect couple. All along the movie we see how her relations with some people change a lot. Though she first doesn't want to go out with Paulie, she soon realizes there's something she can't deny between them. She also starts to be too close to the couple (and especially the husband) she's chosen to raise her baby, which leads her to know some things she probably shouldn't. Anyway, Juno always manages to take good decisions. I really enjoyed watching the light, funny movie. Though it's not the movie of the year, it is really nice and cute little story to see."

","Juno is a wonderful movie that explores the life of a young girl who has and unplanned pregnancy and her choice to have the baby and gift it to another couple. The movie is funny witty and clever but also addresses in the unplanned pregnancy issues very delicately and very well as well as talking about the hard decisions of whether to have an abortion or not. the two Young actors Michael Cera and Ellen Page do an amazing job and steal the show, right now it could even be the best one they have starred in. Jennifer Garner does her job as a good backup. Its a movie that is not great in how its produced but its a movie that you would happily sit down and watch again and again."

Ellen Page stars as the title character, an independent-minded teenager confronting an unplanned pregnancy and the subsequent events that put pressures of adult life onto her. Michael Cera, Olivia Thirlby, J. K. Simmons, Allison Janney, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman also star.It was written by Diablo Cody and directed by Jason Reitman. <br/><br/>Juno may seem wise beyond her years, but after sleeping with classmate Bleeker, the pregnant teen quickly realizes how little she really knows about life.Thankfully, Juno has been blessed with parents who trust their daughter's judgment, and a best friend named Leah, who's always willing to help out in a pinch. With a little help from Leah, Juno soon comes into contact with Mark and Vanessa,who happens to be an affluent suburban couple who have been unable to conceive a child of their own. Mark and Vanessa seem like they would make great parents, and are eager to adopt Juno's unborn child. Now, as adolescent Juno is faced with a series of very adult decisions, she will draw on the support of her family and friends in order to discover who she truly is, and discover that one bad choice can have a lifetime of consequences.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman make Juno the marvelously center of a wistfully acerbic comedy that qualifies as a feminist version of Knocked Up.Its smart script and direction are matched by assured performances in a coming of age story.Although on some counts, it is unrealistic and does not probe deeply.But it has undeniable charm that makes it one of the brightest and funniest comedies ever released."
"brownman83","8","1","3","12 February 2012"," Excellent writing and great directing
","Juno, surprisingly, is a very smart, a very different sort of comedy which takes an approach on something oh so very dark (such as teen pregnancy) and makes it into a light, calming movie. It makes the main character, Juno (Ellen Page), not feel as if she's in a fix, but as if she's in a problem that just takes time to complete. And she says the time will come when the baby comes out, so that's when it'll be solved. But then that's where one of my problems with the movie arises. Although Ellen Page's and the whole cast's acting was great, the movie felt a bit unrealistic. I mean, Juno just walked around, lugging a baby and not feeling a bit of regret for herself, and her parents's reaction was definitely nothing like another parents reaction would be. But as I said before, what makes this film spectacular is the fact that teen pregnancy isn't sucky, but should be taken simply and you just have to with it. The best part about this film though, is the writing. Good god, I was giggling at almost every line, and every single word of dialogue intrigued me. The vast vocabulary that Diablo Cody put into this film made it so modern and different, and surprisingly, there was not very much cussing either. The best lines also came from Ellen Page, obvioulsey, and that was also in part because of her acting. If this film was an audio tape story, and not a movie, I still would've given it a 10 out of 10. The directing, as well, was fantastic. Jason Reitman totally put all his effort into the perfect shots, the perfect transitions, and the excellent editing. His single shots in places made the film seem very independent and overall extremely enjoyable. Also, at some places, when Juno would be talking about something, such as her favorite band, Reitman would add pictures and screen to show who they were. And these only lasted for but 3 seconds, while others lasted a bit longer. Also, he added many recurring themes within the film, such as cross country runners and blue ICEES (you'll know what I mean when you see the film). Then, there were some aspects of the film that got annoying. First of all, was the country music. Although the original song at the end was catchy, I could not enjoy the score. I also thought the character development wasn't fully established. Juno and her boyfriends connection was quite awkward and I wasn't really sure if they were just friends or in a reltaionship. Overall, though, I still enjoyed the film. I don't think I could watch it anytime over and over again, so it won't be making my favorite movies of all time list.<br/><br/>As it is, Juno is an excellently written, nicely directed, and well acted film with very few flaws, giving it an 8/10. A-"
"MovieGuy109","9","1","3","5 December 2011"," A commercial film with more personality than most.
","Juno was a rare surprise that made me quite impressed with director Jason Reitman. Reitman has marked himself as an intelligent filmmaker because he uses well-known stars such as Bateman and Garner so unconventionally and pairs them up with two talented young actors like Page and Cera, who both demonstrate great form here. Every actor is well-casted and Reitman hits the right notes through most of his storytelling. Juno is a character we might not want to like, but somehow she draws us in and not against our wishes. Warm comedy with insightful subject matter and Page wonderful in her breakthrough role as the pregnant girl."
"niamh-94","8","1","3","1 August 2011"," A Gem
","I personally watched this film for the first time on a long-haul flight. I enjoyed it immensely and then began to wonder, had it simply been so good because I was so bored and miserable on my lonely nine hour flight, or had it really been the charming and quirky film I thought it was?<br/><br/>A month or so later, I bought the DVD for a few pounds and watched again. I was right, it was still as funny, heart-warming and strangely gripping as it had been on that flight. Ellen Page is superb. I had started out not liking in her in the main role, but within about 7 or 8 minutes she has you on board. The other actors are well, excellent, in a rather understated way, which does make you like them even more. <br/><br/>The film is simply a gentle, fun film that will win your heart. It doesn't feel overly clever, or complicated. It just tells a story. A good, old fashioned story. No special effects or political agenda. <br/><br/>The only slight complaint is the casting of Jennifer Garner. She was the wrong choice by a clear mile. She does her best, but she adds very little. Someone perhaps more flexible in their acting would have been better."
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","3","21 July 2010"," A real Page turner
","An unusual title for an unusual movie but one that is an absolute delight. Juno is a 16 year old girl living in Minnesota, USA who is named after a Roman goddess and she is played by 20 year old Canadian Ellen Page in a wonderfully mature and quirky performance that achieved an Academy Award nomination. Early on in the film, she becomes pregnant and the rest of the story is how she - and her parents and the intended adopted parents of the baby - deal with the situation. J K Simmons, Allison Janney, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner bring real texture to the adult roles.<br/><br/>The witty script is a cracking one and comes from Diablo Cody, a pen name for one-time stripper Brook Busey and it won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Shooting was in and around Vancouver, standing in for Minnesota, and the tiny budget of US$6.5 million was recouped within three weeks of (limited) release. Personally I could have done without the songs from Kimya Dawson, but in fact the soundtrack was very successful in its own right.<br/><br/>The director is Canadian-born Jason Reitman whose father Ivan directed such movies as ""Ghostbusters""."
"k-headington","10","1","3","28 January 2010"," A multi faceted original film
","This film looks at concepts and points of view that is rarely seen on the screen.<br/><br/>It is original and clever and as I teach teenagers, I find myself understanding both facets of this film. The adult and adolescent thinking and language. And Although I'm in New Zealand I realize that teenagers are pretty much the same throughout.<br/><br/>There are those who don't get the humor or the themes are challenging for them but this is what makes a diverse entertainment industry with something for everyone.<br/><br/>I went to this film knowing nothing about it. My favorite way to view a film. So therefore I will say nothing more except I enjoyed it tremendously and the DVD commentary is even better."
"theaudrey84","8","1","3","22 September 2008"," Do not expect messages, try to enjoy details.
","I read many of the comments here and saw that many people did not like the movie in terms of plot and message given. I actually liked the movie.<br/><br/>Firstly, I think one should not really mind much about the ""message"" given in movies such as this. This movie does not try to convey any message on ""teenage sex"" anyway. I think opposed to many comments written here, the movie does not encourage youngsters to have sex and get pregnant at 16. Most research show that movies do not really encourage people to imitate actions, such as violence, smoking cigarettes and so on. Together with many social factors, the TV series and movies might be a ""factor"" on penetration of such act but definitely is not a ""cause"".<br/><br/>Also, some have criticized that there is a scene in the movie where Juno's step mom argues with the ultrasound technician, saying that some teenagers may raise children much better than adults. Some said that the movie states this but does not offer any solution... As I said, the movie does not aim to ""find any solution"" or convey a ""message"" about teenagers getting pregnant, having abortion or raising children. There, Juno makes a controversial decision towards having the baby and thus reacts against people who degrade her action.<br/><br/>Secondly, I think the plot and characters were quite well established. Juno is a teenage, with rights and wrongs. Like most teenagers, she is in between being a child and a grown-up. She is still a child in most of her manners, though she proves herself that she has become an adult by having sex. Yes, because she is only a teenager and is not ""perfect"" she gets pregnant. And actually, because she is a little nuts and unexpectedly brave, she decides to give birth to the child (a normal person would have an abortion, right?). And because she is actually just a child, she naively spends time with Mark, not projecting the results. Mark has a childish soul and they get on very well but still they can't be ""friends"" as in teenage world, because Mark is an ""adult"" and adult men never see women as friends!!! Of course here Juno has an underlying tendency towards Mark (as she is not ""perfect""), because in adults world he is the only person giving value to her. Also maybe she feels better being treated like a grown up by an adult. When she gets jealous of Paulie, she goes to him and feels better and appraised. But she then finds out this might lead to dangerous results! <br/><br/>However, she does right things too... She wants the child to grow up in a loving environment and leaves the child to Vanessa as she knows she will love her. After seeing that the ""adult"" life is not so perfect and she does not belong there yet, she finally understands that her own world and Paulie is where she belongs, because she is yet just a child.<br/><br/>In terms of music, I liked the movie. I especially like the Belle and Sebastian, which was used in the movie. Music was neatly chosen. Also, without such music, the movie would be more serious and dramatic. What makes the movie easy watchable and light is the music.<br/><br/>In terms of Juno's language Well, I am not a native English speaker. So, I cannot truly judge whether it makes sense of her speaking like that or not. But as far as I know, teenagers love to speak slang language, using many connector meaningless words and have their own kind of talking terms. Because they always criticize the adults but want to be valued by them (because they think they are adults too and should not be ruled by them), they usually use an awkward language. In these terms, I think the movie reflects the irony quite well, especially in the scene where Juno first meets with the child adopter family and their lawyer.<br/><br/>In general, I think Juno is a well written and directed movie. Do not expect messages, try to enjoy the details."
"Bevan - #4","8","1","3","10 September 2008"," I seem to have missed the part where this was supposed to be a political documentary.
","Let's get a few procedural matters out of the way, shall we? (1) Quite aside from the bizarre (if common) view that failure to explicitly condemn/praise a point of view = condoning/rejecting it, sometimes people make choices. It's not the job of a film to - somewhat dishonestly - suggest that protagonists must consider every possible option with equal weight or make a choice in a sensible and clear-headed fashion. Neither must such a choice reflect political or moral allegiance to one side or the other; a lot of human beings, weirdly enough, do what seems good at the time or pick the least bad option. Oddly enough, quite a few pregnant teens *do* reject the option of keeping the baby out of hand in favor of abortion or adoption, and if this *were* supposed to be a political polemic, do we really want to encourage 15-year-old single mothers? (That being said, plainly Juno *did* consider the option. ""I'm a kid,"" she said, kicking the notion to the curb.) (2) Sometimes people (and even teenagers, and even their families), react in level-headed, supportive ways in a crisis. For everyone who screeches that Juno is unrealistic because her parents don't take (too many) swings at her, physically or verbally, gosh ... parents have been known to react that way. Not everyone is a hot-headed screamer.<br/><br/>(3) Works of fiction are not required to (and seldom do) ""handle things responsibly."" Kids screw up. *People* screw up. And some brush themselves off and muddle through as best they can. I'm sure it would have satisfied the amour propre of many of the critics if Mac came after Bleeker with a shotgun, if Juno went through screaming fits, if she and Mark slept together, and if somehow Juno was grotesquely punished for her sins, but dern it all, you didn't get to write the screenplay.<br/><br/>(4) Kids use ""dude,"" ""like,"" ""whatever"" and all other manner of jargon all the time, and have since Ugh the Caveman complained to Ughina about how disrespectful the cave kids were. Wrap your head around the fact and move on.<br/><br/>I know, it's really hard. You all want the movie to be exactly what you want, with characters who make the exact choices you would yourself (or pretend you would, anyway), reactions that exactly meet your preconceptions, and with those people whom you peg as good guys and those who you peg as bad guys getting what you think they ought to have coming to them ... and most of all, to agree thematically with your political, social and moral philosophies. It's a pity when you run into a flick that doesn't measure up.<br/><br/>Where I differ, though, is in the sheer *indignation* I'm reading in the comments: how dare this movie not reflect my worldview? And that's desperately unfair.<br/><br/>8/10: it's realistic, it's honest and ... it HAPPENS."
"ubh-2","8","1","3","31 August 2008"," That's a very good film.
","Last year two films, which told about pregnancy were released. Those were ""Knocked Up"" and ""Juno"". And that film's were popular. ""Knocked Up"" gathered big box office, good reviews of the critics and viewers. But that success was strange. The script was boring and tight, there was little humor (that was comedy) and there was striking actors' performance. But «Juno's» success was not strange. Juno gathered big box office, good reviews of the critics and viewers as well. And «Juno» won Oscar. What are the merits in «Juno»? That is good, pleasant and remembering film. Why? Diablo Cody wrote an original screenplay (in spite of hackneyed theme). And Ellen Page gave a demonstration of amazing theater talent. That was very interesting role. Juno is an incredible, charming and very curious hero, who hard herself in hard situation. Film has other merits. That's a very good direction of Jason Reitman, an excellent soundtrack and wonderful performance of other actors. That's a very good film. Maybe that is one of very positive and kind cinemas among winners in Oscar 2007"
"jd_ching","9","1","3","23 August 2008"," Dark and Dry Humor, Not for everybody but appeals to me
","I thought this movie was great... the acting was pretty nice, the management of music was actually very funny, the character of Juno is a complex one.<br/><br/>I really love the dark humor of the family and the dry humor along the movie itself... it reminds me of the movies of Wes Anderson. Perhaps it is not the stupid humor where someone falls and everyone laughs but it has a very interesting humor.<br/><br/>Cinical, Sinister, really interesting. At first I thought it would be too much melodrama. But I find it OK to see it was quite not melodramatic. Perhaps the final scenes were a little bit cheesy but the last scene was a really well achieved scene, in therms of management of music, photography and management of positions. Has a pretty decent photography for being a Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>I think this is the case of movies like Wes Anderson films, like Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou or Jim Jarmusch like Broken Flowers (just that the humor is way darker). Where this type of humor does not appeal to anyone, but the absurd, the dryness and the darkness does appeal to me, therefore I give these movie Two Thumbs Up."
"Rogue-32","9","1","3","13 August 2008"," I think I might want a hamburger phone
","I was familiar with Jason Reitman before ""Thank You For Smoking"", from his fantastic short film, ""In God We Trust"", which I caught at a film festival a few years back. I was a fan of Diablo Cody after seeing her on Letterman and buying her book Candy Girl: A Year In the Life of an Unlikely Stripper the very next day. And I knew all too well how great an actor Ellen Page was from seeing ""Hard Candy"", so ""Juno"" was a no-brainer for me ~ I was there the very first day it finally opened in my neighborhood.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare films that actually lives up to and mightily surpasses its majestic hype, thanks to Cody's killer script, Reitman's sure-handed direction and a thoroughly captivating performance from Ms. Page, who manages to create a character we hadn't quite seen before but yet feel we know intimately by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Brilliant casting throughout, especially Michael Cera as Juno's true love Paulie Bleeker and J.K. Simmons as her father, but everyone here serves the production beautifully.<br/><br/>The best thing about Cody's script is how specific the details about the characters are - she gives just enough to flesh them out, make them 3-dimensional without telling too much and losing the edge. And she makes all the right choices in the course of the story, for these characters, whom she clearly loves - just when we think it's going down a predictable road, we get something different. Brilliant choices for the music too - it's quirky and quietly understated, adding still another magical layer to this near-perfect and heartfelt winner of a film."
"ellkew","8","1","3","13 July 2008"," Brilliantly funny
","I cannot believe the amount of people that dislike this film. I don't think it was totally original, very few films are, but I do think the dialogue was superb. It sparkled. Some of the lines were brilliantly funny. The two leads were perfectly cast and the chemistry was very strong. I loved the use of the music, always nice to hear something original. I read a comment here that said they obviously could not get clearance for proper music. You must have seen a different film to the one I saw. There were some very touching scenes and I felt that the characters were well rounded. It's the sort of film that you could easily pass by but for me worked on every level. Touching, without being sentimental, very funny, well acted and not over long. Great comedy."
"Mightyzebra","8","1","3","22 June 2008"," A sweet film - not just for teenagers.
","This is a sweet film for anyone over the age of 10. Yes, it does have quite a lot of sex in it. The story is sweet, the plot is sweet and the love is sweet (if you are thinking what I am thinking, then this film is like biting into a milkyway bar). All these parts of the film are good as well as sweet. The characters, are well planned and thought up and the setting, Minnesota in all the four seasons, are good as well. <br/><br/>In this film, a girl called Juno, aged 16, finds herself pregnant. This would not be so abnormal in the middle ages, but ""Juno"" is a contemporary film and this pregnancy is pretty serious. Juno has a great deal to think about, for example, telling her parents, telling the future father (a cute boy called Bleeker) and finding someone instead of her to take care of the baby...<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone who likes sweet films with teenagers and who do not mind a bit of sex and a bit of language, who is over 10 (people over 60 may or may not like this, but if you are over 60, you ought to look at some other reviews before you make your final decision). Enjoy ""Juno""! :-)<br/><br/>P.S It seems to me that this film is supposed to discourage under-age pregnancy, because of the trouble Juno has to go through."
"edwagreen","8","1","3","15 June 2008"," Juno Really Heats Up ***1/2
","A really inspiring film despite the usual subject matter of an unwanted teen pregnancy.<br/><br/>Ellen Page really gives a lot of herself in her Oscar nominated performance as a teenager in trouble.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this girl has her head on her shoulders. She knows that she can't keep the child and is able to find what she thinks will be the ideal couple to adopt her baby. Unfortunately, the couple proves not to be what we're all expecting. It seems that Page has entered their lives just at a time when their very marriage is disintegrating rapidly.<br/><br/>Ellen's father and step-mother play an understanding couple in this situation. I was a little perplexed regarding the stepmother part of Allison Janney. When hearing the news of Page's pregnancy, she begins to exhibit religious fanaticism that we saw her do so well on a comedy level in ""Hairspray."" Suddenly, she falls into line and gives a truly compelling supporting performance.<br/><br/>This is a lovely, emotionally paced film."

"bolehornot","7","2","10","18 February 2008"," An after film review
","Juno is a terrific film about a teenage girl who finds herself pregnant. Ellen Page truly deserves an Oscar for her outstanding performance as Juno, the pregnant teenage girl.<br/><br/>Juno comes across as a girl who is headstrong but soft on the inside. Usually for teenage mums, there is a lot of trauma and confusion at the news of pregnancy. But Ellen Page portrays Juno as a happy-go-lucky girl next door and this, despite the lack of support from the unwilling father.<br/><br/>And yet, when after she has found what she perceives as a loving couple with all the means of providing her child with a comfortable and caring life in contrast to hers ( Mother divorced when she was young), she was devastated to learn that the would be father of her child was intent on divorcing his wife and making out with her.<br/><br/>The next scene of her crying in the car is probably the most emotional scene in the movie. In the next few scenes, she constantly questions herself if there is anything such as true love or if it is possible for a couple to live happily throughout their lives.<br/><br/>Juno never once did show her anguish at school for for being ridiculed at being pregnant. And yet, we could see that it was not because she was impervious to others. In the scene with Bleeker, the child's natural father, she expressed her jealousy of Bleeker going out with another girl and she broke down at the trauma that she was going through as a youth undergoing pregnancy in high school. The conversation she had with Bleeker was nothing short of powerful and moving.<br/><br/>Page definitely deserves an Oscar as her role as Juno, and Juno is a terrific film that everyone should watch. Everyone will have something to learn from Juno."
"stensson","7","2","10","4 February 2008"," A nice surprise
","This is the kind of movie nice girls have strong problems getting their rough boyfriends to. But even they will find it was worth it. A charming comedy with this brilliant Ellen Page as the main character.<br/><br/>You maybe don't expect much from a movie about a 16 year old pregnant girl. Especially not since this is not supposed to be a drama. But it is in a trustworthy way. This working class girl is going to have her child adopted by the yuppie couple. But still, she's the strongest of them, making life change in more ways than just having this baby.<br/><br/>This comedy is not only charming, it's also intelligent. Screwball hasn't died in Hollywood and here's the proof."
"bobsgrock","9","2","10","22 January 2008"," A superb indie film that is comparable to any major production.
","After seeing Juno, I couldn't help but wonder why the credits were so colorful and uniquely shaped. Then I remembered that this was an indie film. Funny, it doesn't play like one. For all that has been said about independent films and their right in Hollywood, I have seen a few that are good (Little Miss Sunshine) and others that are great (Garden State). Juno is, in my opinion, one of the better ones to come out the past decade. The key here, like in most films, is the main character and the writing. Ellen Page as Juno MacGuff is incredibly good. At a mere 4'11"", she looks the part and has the witty tongue and charming face to go with it. From the opening scene with the chair to the final scene with Paulie, we love her and only want the best for her. While most of that can be attributed to Page's excellent performance, a large amount of credit must be given to first-time screenwriter Diablo Cody. Here is a premise which has been done before in many different ways, and there are so many instances which could have led this film to be only sub par or good. Cody, though, walks the line and doesn't take a side on teen pregnancy. Instead, she focuses in on the path to pregnancy and birth. It is humorous, sad, and heartwarming. This film charmed nearly all the critics and most fans, so I expected it to receive at least 3 Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Actress, and Screenplay (which it did). Overall, this is a great film that gives marvelous insight to a more personal problem of teens in America. Never before has it been this mainstream, and never before has it been this touching. A truly great film, indie or not."
"intelearts","9","2","10","19 January 2008"," One of the best teenager comedies...
","Watching Juno is a treat - it is one of the few films that really does seem to get inside the teenager world - sure it is too smart sometimes, but in the main it really does hold true to its aim. It is one of a handful of films that made me actually remember what being a teenager was really like.<br/><br/>With a very solid cast and a sure hand upon the helm it never loses its way - and contains lots of small details that reward close viewing.<br/><br/>Above all, the script and Ellen Page's performance as the non-angst ridden, but cool and smart teenager that shines. For me the biggest surprise was Allison Janey and JK Simmons who are wonderful as the practical, boring, fierce, calm, and loving and utterly convincing step mom and father of Juno.<br/><br/>This is the kind of film that will be seen as a milestone; I guarantee that it will win awards not just for being funny and fresh and having heart, but for being an important film that moves the current youth films beyond Superbad..."
"mockturtle","7","2","10","26 December 2007"," Heart overcomes quirk OD
","I'm writing to provided some much needed balanced criticism. 99% of the reviews here are OMG! Or totally hating.<br/><br/>Let's dismiss the main hater point: The dialogue is not realistic, ""nobody talks like that!"" I'm sorry, but you'll have to point me to the carven letters on the tablets of screen writing that Robert McKee brought down from the Griffith Park Observatory in the Hollywood Hills to find the hoi-polloi worshiping the fake-golden skin of pornstars that say that your dialogue has to be realistic. If you want realistic dialogue go have a conversation, you'll see how exciting it is.<br/><br/>Now the good things: Ellen Page is radiant and perfect. All of the performances are top-notch across the board but it's obviously a starmaker for her. She brings out the vulnerability behind each of the tough stances and snappy remarks. Michael Cera is also perfect and hilariously ill-at-ease as the pursued (""whose idea was it?""). J.K. Simmons and Alison Janney do solid, sensitive and funny work as parents that are much more fiercely protective and supportive than their easy demeanor might suggest. The baby-belly is very realistic, too, so props to props.<br/><br/>Now the problems: Really what we have here is an okay script saved by excellent direction and performances. It obviously is frontloaded with too much quirk, but it helps that many of those early lines are actually funny. However, most of the heart that makes the whole thing worthwhile is provided by the actors and not the script. Paulie Bleeker has almost no distinguishing characteristics, there's no reason for Juno to be in love with himexcept that it's Michael Cera. See what I mean? With even just a passable cast this would have been a disaster of the-kid-in-Little-Miss-Sunshine-wore-a-fatsuit proportions. The area that is not saved is the portrayal of the couple (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). Bateman's performance gives the character a dignity that is completely lacking in the script, which uses him mainly as a joke aboutArrested Development. Oy. And he almost raises his son's kid, in TV-Movie cross-pollination. Anyway, it portrays the way Jennifer Garner's character freezes him completely out of the relationship and makes him live all of the parts of his life that matter to him in basements and closets as second to the outrage of HOW COULD HE NOT WANT A BABY??? It refuses to take his character seriously, as evidenced by his come-on to Juno, which crosses a line of reality. He's a guy that has compromised his dreams and is actually contributing, he's not some burnout, but they treat him like a stuck-in-the-90's joke. Then on the other side is Garner's character, a psychotic frigid control freak we're supposed to believe is going to be the best mother ever. I pity that kid and the incarceration that lies before it. The film seems to prefer a strange idea of a relationship and adulthood, where you get rid of anything you care about, live only for cheesecake colored paint, and if you don't you might be the sort of person that tries to mack it to a pregnant 16 year-old.<br/><br/>What is up with these baby saviors? Solondz should have released ""Palindromes"" this year.<br/><br/>Also: Diablo Cody (the stupidest name I've ever heard) is so disingenuous when she claims not to have ambition; she's obviously made of it. Plus: David Bowie wrote ""All the Young Dudes,"" bears mentioning? In the end, this shows how good Jason Reitman really is (huzzah nepotism). I enjoyed and was invested in the film as it was happening, it was only later it began to bother me, but still whoever put it there ""Juno"" has a lot of heart and that's what carries the film."
"cdelacroix1","7","2","10","28 December 2007"," A Female Napoleon Dynamite
","I saw this movie today, and found a sort of coming-of-age tale told with a large dose of campy humor. I thought this movie was on the whole a good movie, though not the stand-out dark comedy/drama that it's reported to be.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on a vivid 16 y.o. pregnant teen named Juno, who is in so many ways a female version of Napoleon Dynamite. If you liked Napoleon Dynamite, you'll very probably like Juno; if you didn't like Napoleon Dynamite, you'll probably be well advised to pass on Juno.<br/><br/>I myself liked Napoleon Dynamite ... although the constant sardonic humor and uber-Attitude becomes rather trying, both in Juno and in Napoleon Dynamite, the whole does kind of grow on me ... as on others. This is the kind of character that I myself find fun, if cloying. I don't myself enjoy sardonic put-downs as a part of my regular diet. One viewing is enough for me. But that's me; to each his/her own.<br/><br/>The storyline I thought was very engaging, and the supporting script conveys it well. The acting ranged from solid to excellent. Ellen Page as Juno is perfectly cast and delivers her character perfectly. Michael Cera did a solid job as Paulie Bleeker. Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney, and J.K.

"moutonbear25","9","2","10","27 December 2007"," Mature for its age
","I must be older at heart than I thought. I was instantly put off by Jason Reitman's JUNO. Here you have this little movie about a pregnant teenager who is just trying to do the right thing by everyone and all I could think was how hard it was trying to have its own marginalized identity. A sketched doodle of the word, ""autumn"" appears at the top of the screen; the sounds of Barry Louis Polisar's indie acoustic music begin to play as a comic book-like animated title sequence takes over the screen; Rainn Wilson, working as a convenience store counter clerk, says things like, ""Your eggo is preggo,"" and ""What's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle?"" It was as though Reitman was pulling out every trick he could think of to make sure we knew how edgy his film was. ""We are indie!"" it screamed like a loud teenager yammering away in the back of the theatre. Only, just like that teenager, JUNO is much deeper than it first appears and simply requires a closer look to see Reitman's sensitive, gentle hand at work. JUNO just may be the most earnest and humble film I've seen all year. It's merely hiding behind a tough exterior.<br/><br/>That tough exterior comes courtesy of first-time screenwriter, Diablo Cody, and is reinforced by Reitman's strong understanding of the nuanced material. It is honest, frank and forgiving, which is a refreshing take from the usual damnation pregnant teenage girls suffer on film. Parents don't scream and shout when they find out about their daughter's situation; nobody forbids anyone from seeing anybody else ever again. It is not the least bit dramatic considering that exaggeration colors mostly every word uttered on screen. (Look, I can embellish too!) The non-judgmental approach allows almost every character to come from his or her own perspective and place in the story, making them much more real than they let on. We know that prospective adoptive mother, Vanessa (Jennifer Garner), is concerned with image and perception because we see her hands straightening frames and towels while waiting to receive company before we even see her face. We know that her husband, Mark (Jason Bateman), is not as enthusiastic about the adoption as his wife is because he isn't by her side when Juno (Ellen Page) first appears at their door. These kinds of subtle visual touches act like prenatal vitamins meant to ensure that Cody's script is born with a healthy heartbeat.<br/><br/>JUNO also gives birth to a new star, albeit a little bit past her due date (despite her young age of 20). Halifax native, Ellen Page, carries the majority of the film and is as complex as they come without making it seem labored (no pun intended). Past starring roles in lesser-known films like HARD CANDY and THE TRACEY FRAGMENTS were explosive and impossible to ignore only the films themselves were overlooked. Turning in another unforgettable performance in a crowd pleaser is sure to get her the accolades and recognition she deserves. Page whips out Cody's snappy pseudo-hipster speak with fervor and confidence but gives herself away without realizing. She always plays it cool so that no one, including herself, can acknowledge how frightened she must be to be in her position. Her decision to have her baby and put it up for adoption rather than go the abortion route is brave but naïve as she has no idea how adult her decision actually is. She speaks like she has all the answers and yet has no idea what she's talking about most of the time, but once you catch a glimmer of that fragility, anything that came off as false prior, shows itself as the front that it is.<br/><br/>Reitman, Cody, Page and the rest of the fantastic cast (J.K. Simmons, Alison Janney and the fascinatingly talented and gangly, Michael Cera) light JUNO afire with warmth and genuine caring. This is a movie about real people dealing with the obstacles they're faced with rather than sitting around and whining about them. On that level, there's nothing indie about this movie. Instead, JUNO is the perfect portrait of a young girl flung into adulthood unexpectedly. She feels prepared, realizes she isn't, learns that she needs others and yet carries herself like she's been the one calling the shots all along. It sure sounds awfully adult to me."
"alrodbel","10","2","10","24 December 2007"," Conservative Propaganda
","Yep, it shows the possibility of the unwanted childed being a ""gift from Jesus"" as Juno's mom described it, rather than ""a problem solved."" But a film like this could give ""propaganda"" a good name. It was genuine, touching, engaging, amusing, intelligent and deeply felt. As an example of the cinematic art, it fully deserves the ten stars I gave it. But now lets get down to reality.<br/><br/>Juno, delightfully portrayed by Ellen Page is a golden girl in a golden world. Blessed by an understanding mother, and a step father whose only goal was offering love and support to his child, is a rare gift. Sure, she is a talented gorgeous bright girl, but in the wrong high school that wouldn't be enough to shield her from the vulnerability of carrying a child to term.<br/><br/>I have to compare this film with another of the finest films I've seen that covered the same territory of unwanted pregnancy, Jesus' Son (check out my review). In both cases the parents loved each other, in both cases they both dealt with the challenge of what to do with the unwanted child. But in the earlier film the parents were drug addicted and had no social support system.<br/><br/>Most women faced with the challenge of unwanted pregnancy have a life somewhere in between the two depicted in these two films. Decisions are personal, based on what the mother has to give, whether she has the resources, and whether the child will be a beautiful white baby, desired by all, or one of the races less marketable in this country.<br/><br/>So, while I loved this film, it touches on an issue that is in the forefront of our public political life. It behooves us to keep this in the perspective of the real world out there, where delightful happy endings just may not always be possible."

","This movie, when I went in I heard the reviews and I read the person to person summaries, and opinions, I didn't know what to expect . . . but, it was completely brilliant. Props to Ellen Page for taking on a roll and just making it . . . herself. Juno was a well written, well scripted movie that deals with the conflict of basically being pregnant in high school, Juno starts of stating lines about a chair and where the baby was conceived, when I first started watching it, if you did your research like I did, and you are an obsessed fan of Michael Cera and Ellen Page as I am, you will know that most of the trailer scenes are in the beginning of the movie when you see it. As I said before Ellen Page was astonishing, and Michael Cera, oh god I love him and his acting. (Hah, little weird fanatic crush). Anyway the two blended well together in this movie, but my only pet peeve was what about Paulie? Michael didn't take on a huge roll to this movie, and he should have had more parts, he is however the father of the baby, but his parts in the movies were very well acted out, and he took on another roll that makes you love him even more. I enjoyed the fact though that Ellen Page made herself look like a real person instead of those flawless outcasts that are always in the cheesy Hollywood films. The cast was excellent, and the ending I couldn't believe, it was great and it completely through you off track. It was a very large decision to make and it was an excellent one at that. What more can I say about this movie? Oh I have no idea, it was amazing, it was completely breath taking, the cast was great, the acting was great everything was just good. What I really think was the best part about this movie was the message the movie portrayed and the fact that it kept you laughing and feeling good that not everyone is perfect."
"snncy2000","7","2","11","18 January 2008"," Juno, poor kid that made us laugh.
","----Watch out, real spoiler------ <br/><br/>There are films technically flawless, good acting, superb direction, nice script you know everything looks fine. But still it leaves you with a bitter taste...<br/><br/>Juno is a movie, it's actually the name of the girl that movie is about. This sixteen year old young lady learns that she's got pregnant from her first sex experience with a classmate boy who doesn't seem to aware of a sh*t! Then she first goes to him to tell that she's pregnant and she doesn't get any intelligible response from him. She decides to go to abortion, by the way she's discussing the situation with her closest girl friend and we learn this kind of issues are not so unknown to those teenagers since they know abortion center and all the other stuff about it. At this point it's the question that comes to our mind why they didn't protect themselves while having sex, but movie is all about ""this kind of things do happen!"".<br/><br/>Juno first goes to abortion center but cannot bare it and turns back.<br/><br/>Then Juno and her girl friend come up with an incredible solution, they found a adoption couple from newspaper ads. So baby will goto a loving and caring nice family and everything will be fine. But before that they must tell the situation to Juno's family, her father and stepmother.<br/><br/>Juno does that, and surprisingly her parents take this very calmly. They don't actually comment on this. Juno and her father go to adopting family, they are rich, nice, willing to a have the baby and everything is okay.<br/><br/>Then pregnancy goes on, Juno's belly getting bigger and bigger.<br/><br/>Juno and adopting father interestingly becomes friends. Juno visits him time to time, they seem to have common interests like music, horror movies and such.<br/><br/>On her last visit, Juno and the guy (husband of adopting family) gets real close, I mean they dance and hug. Here we clearly see that Juno is a poor lonely girl, hungry for love, she's seeking love or to be loved everywhere or with everyone. Her stepmother, whose a very nice woman as an stepmother in fact, tells once to Juno after one of her visits to adopting family's husband, ""I know you, stop going to him, he's married, you cannot drop by anyones house like that"", I think this scene is one of the key points of the movie, should have been more emphasized.<br/><br/>But husband tells Juno that he doesn't actually want the baby, his wife is crazy about having the baby, he gave the ad to newspaper expecting no one to reply. He's not happy with the marriage and he's going to divorce. At this point wife arrives home and Juno leaves their house crying. But couple hours later she comes back and gives them a note which we did not see at that time.<br/><br/>Juno and her stupid boyfriend become friends again, at this point we think they'll have the baby together and (even) they'll marry.<br/><br/>She gives birth the baby, but adopting family, I mean only the wife, takes the baby, because the note Juno left says to wife ""I am still in, if you're in"".<br/><br/>Then everything is good. Juno and her boyfriend sing a song together and movie ends (I'm not kidding!).<br/><br/>I was really shocked when I watched a TV show about teenage-pregnancy one or two years ago. There were families (mostly mothers), and they say ""we should inform our children about safer sex and blah blah .. "" But nobody talked about morals. Sex without marriage is bad enough (of course in my believing) but letting your 13 year old kid to intercourse with someone and to learn that she's pregnant must be the worst thing can happen to any parent.<br/><br/>And NO woman (yes she's a women now) can cope with giving away her baby easily. It must be catastrophic for her. Something that will go with her all the way her life. If you take a puppy from it's mother, mother dog cries for a week at least!<br/><br/>As some of other comments said, nice movie about very tough topic, and sometime it feels that movie makes things to look less worse than actually they are..<br/><br/>Poor kid Juno forgive us for laughing at you or what happened to you."
"jerryc-4","10","2","11","15 January 2008"," Juno is every bit better than the hype
","It's kinda funny how about every 20 years Hollywood gets it right in a teen comedy. I think back to the Graduate, then on to Say Anything and now Juno. If one thinks giving a poor rating to a truly great movie is funny or in some way makes them look smart, it's sadly untrue. Juno stars Ellen Page who plays a 16-year old high schooler who just up and decides one day that she's ready to have sex, unfortunately for her and her boyfriend, Michael Cera... she gets pregnant. While it seems easy and simple enough of a story, the layers start in. Juno doesn't want the baby... Juno doesn't want some easy way out... Juno just wants to play music and have this baby already given to someone who will love and take care of it as if it's really their own child. Juno isn't looking for a payday or a ""oh, that's too bad""... Juno is amazing. See Juno today, you will once again feel like movies are worth watching again. It is the best picture of 2007, without question, and you will feel that life is just a little bit happier place from watching it.<br/><br/>Jerry in Gladstone Oregon"
"rv56","9","2","11","15 January 2008"," humorous and light take on a pretty serious issue
","Ellen page has portrayed the role of Juno really well. Michael Cera continues from where he left off in SuperBad. The whole screenplay and everyone's roles just fit in perfectly. This movie shows kids the consequences they have to face when they get pregnant young and that abortion is not the only way out. Juno's decision to give the baby to Jennifer garner even after knowing she is getting a divorce is pretty touching and shows the maturity of Juno. Hilarious one liners break the seriousness but not to a point where you forget the whole backbone of the movie. The supporting cast does a great role as well .Michael Cera's character has done a great job too of owning up to what he did but doing so in a humorous way. Great job of portraying a serious issue with a sense of humor."
"jedifizzle","7","2","11","27 December 2007"," The movie can't decide what it's trying to do.
","The movie is a good one, a nice story with likable characters and a somewhat mature subject wrapped up in a nice, ninety-minute package. Of course, nice, likable characters wrapped up in a ninety-minute package is also why it didn't reach its full potential. <br/><br/>For one, the characters are unbelievable, and that's kind of big for me. Their smart, snappy remarks that were never off or unfunny were way off-base. No one who isn't a Jewish writer who gets paid big bucks to write movies and television shows could ever talk like that, let alone a scared sixteen-year-old girl who has to figure out what to do about the parasite growing in her stomach. And seriously, ""honest to blog""? ""Rad""? ""Boss""? I literally cringed after hearing some of the director's/writers' attempts to be hip. No one talks like that. Stop forcing it. Secondly, the character development was little to none for some characters. Bleeker (Cera), who is second billed, gets his character developed so little that by the end of the movie I don't even care whether or not he and Juno get together. The duo of the Moldy Peaches song did so little for me it's not even funny. And I like Michael Cera as much as the next Arrested Development fan, but his character just seemed like an idiot who didn't know what to do. (Seriously, remember the scene where Juno is going to get the ultrasound and she obviously wants him to come but he's like 'lol OK i wont go then'? What the hell?) And that apparently sexual scene with Bateman came out of right field for me; very little character development yielded me the ability to not see that coming. Finally, it kind of seems to write off teenage pregnancy as just a little thing that can be solved pretty easily. No. Wrong. But I guess for a ninety-minute movie, it did the best it could.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, though. It's not all bad. Overall, it's cute (albeit tongue-in-cheek). It's humorous (to a point), and keeps you entertained whilst trying to keep a mature matter as light as possible. As a teen, I kind of empathized with some of the subject matter and thought the whole ""jocks want goths"" was pretty clever. And I loved the soundtrack. I am still humming that Moldy Peaches song.<br/><br/>Overall, it had some flaws, plot holes, and other such problems, but it was a cute film. It was feel-good, and for a feel-good movie, it wasn't bad.<br/><br/>I would see it again, so I would give it 7/10 stars."
"kesb107","10","2","11","25 December 2007"," Awesome!
","Juno is one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seen, it's not just like every other movie out there. It tells the story from the point of view of someone who isn't perfect and plastic. Not only is the dialogue in the film especially hilarious, but the characters are portrayed amazingly by Page and Cera. The emotional aspect of the movie and the changes that not only Ellen Page's character but all of the characters in the film go through are so true to life. This definitely isn't just another teen movie about stupid high school relationships. It has depth and shows different sides of all of the characters. The writing in the film amazingly captures the complexities of all the different types of relationships portrayed in the movie. This film has some of the most hilarious lines I've ever heard. My favorite one is ""You should've gone to China, you know, 'cause I hear they give away babies like free iPods. You know, they pretty much just put them in those t-shirt guns and shoot them out at sporting events."" because it's hilarious, but at the same time it's partially true, most of the lines in the film are along that same kind of dark humor, but that's what makes it so funny."

"Davalon-Davalon","6","1","4","25 August 2015"," Mixed Bag
","I had heard about this movie for many years and because I am studying the craft of screen writing, and because Diablo Cody won the Oscar for her script, I felt I should see this film. <br/><br/>This is not a summation of the plot but observations about things I felt worked and didn't work. <br/><br/>Pluses: Ellen Page and Michael Cera are total naturals. Although neither one of them have what I would say is immediately obvious star power, their was a current of reality under what they did that made them relatable and as such, their performances resonated. <br/><br/>Things that troubled me: Only when I saw the cut scenes on the extras did I finally understand why Juno was sitting in a chair on the front lawn. But even then, it still didn't make any sense. If the chair and other furniture (and how did any of it get on the lawn of the original owner...considering the woman was in a motorized chair?) was somehow supposed to be ""symbolic"" of the chair Juno and ""Bleeker"" (or ""Paulie""? She used both and therefore his name remained unclear throughout) had sex in, then the symbolism was really wasted and if that wasn't the purpose, then it was just unnecessary. <br/><br/>Second: while the reaction of Juno's parents ( J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney, who both did a great job, despite what I felt were questionable decisions on behalf of Cody) to her pregnancy announcement were admirable (they quickly accepted it and made a decision to support whatever choice she was going to make), it then made absolutely no sense whatsoever that they would allow her, in her condition, to drive a huge car alone on freeway, or anywhere. Juno kept saying she was 16; was it really okay with them that while she was nearly 9 months pregnant she was driving all over the place by herself? This really bothered me. Allison as Brenda, Juno's stepmom (whom Juno seemed to have a lot of resentment towards) showed an intelligent grasp of the situation and was already planning to make sure Juno got her vitamins and visits to the doctor. This type of care and concern went out the window when neither parent seemed to be bothered that Juno, in her condition, was driving a car alone... especially a huge car that might even be a bit of a challenge for an adult to drive. Yes, Brenda mentioned that Juno shouldn't have driven out to ""East Jesus Nowhere"" to visit the prospective adoptive parents, but her concern was that she was visiting the prospective parents, not that she was driving. Didn't make any sense to me. <br/><br/>Third, the scene where Juno gets her ultrasound. The technician may have indeed been a bit judgmental, but frankly it was extremely understandable considering Juno's age and what I would call an ""attitude."" That said, the script asked Brenda to go off on the tech and verbally destroy her because the technician made a very slight judgmental comment. If this scene was supposed to point out how ""cool"" Juno's mom was because she could verbally ""take someone down"" for ""dissing"" her step-daughter, all it achieved was showing how ugly and cruel human beings can be to each other. <br/><br/>Fourth, Cody used my least-liked device: voiceovers. She started out using them indiscriminately and at some point they were completely forgotten about. They were totally 100% unnecessary. She had plenty of other good lines and her story (except for the stupid chair on the lawn) was clear. A VO explanation did nothing to ""clarify"" anything. <br/><br/>Fifth, Juno's stupid gal pal, played to a ""T"" by Olivia Thirby, remains a stupid young woman, even up to the point where Juno is giving birth. I felt like she was watching someone doing performance art as she kept this stupid goofy look on her face throughout. I know the story wasn't about her, and the actress did a great job, but I wish she would have had a moment of sisterly sympathy for Juno, which she never does. <br/><br/>Sixth, while Jason Bateman's character, the failed rock star turned TV commercial jingle composer, may have resented his yuppie life and his yuppie wife (Jennifer Garner, just about perfect), and while he may have found a kindred spirit in Juno, who for a moment, might have given him a chance to relive his failed youth, in what realm of the imagination would he have offered her an alcoholic drink? She was pregnant! With a child he was supposed to be a father to! It wasn't funny. It was disturbing. If that was the desired effect, it was indeed achieved. <br/><br/>Seventh, while other critics, including my beloved Roger Ebert, seemed to love the background music, I found it incredibly irritating. The songs were one step away from being dumb, one step away from being clever. There was too much of it, it was too ""on- the-nose"" and it was generally too loud. People really need to sit down with their sound editors and say,""Enhance, do not overwhelm!""<br/><br/>That said, Ellen Page has talent. She carried her false bravado with her for the entire film until she has a breakdown on the side of the freeway. I felt this moment deserved more attention, but it's possible that it was just the right amount. The jury is still out on it. <br/><br/>Despite the fact that there were things that just didn't sit right with me, the script had its moments, the actors had theirs and it generally held my interest. Jason Reitman, as director, definitely has a handle on dysfunctional family dramas that have bitter humorous moments. I am a big fan of his, and I can appreciate Cody's ear for teen dialogue and for other very, very snappy lines. <br/><br/>I would not watch it again, but I'm glad I saw it."

There wasn't anything for me to hook onto other than her cool hamburger phone. The one thing that I thought wouldn't have happened in reality was when she encountered the clinic receptionist and the ultrasound technician. Both of these characters said things that a professional wouldn't say. People take things too far. Some things that made the movie good/realistic was her feelings for Bleeker. Teenage girls can relate to her feelings expressed throughout the movie towards Bleeker because her relationship was a type of relationship that many teenage girls have. Overall, I would rate this a 6 out of 10 because it is a teen comedy that is based towards teenage girls and or boys."

","Middle-class teenager--brainy, precocious, and mordant rather than cynical--is both surprised and dryly amused at finding herself pregnant after just one sexual experience; after ruling out abortion, she decides to have the baby and give it over to an upscale childless couple advertising in the Penny Saver. Sweetly attuned to cult media and teen-slang, screenwriter Diablo Cody writes sitcom dialogue far superior to what is heard on most sitcoms; influenced, perhaps, by John Hughes and ""Heathers"", Cody goes her own way when setting the tone for her second-act, and the results are pleasantly grounded and genial. As Juno, Ellen Page's mature resolve is entirely embraceable, and the supporting cast is equally fine--although the character of the would-be adoptive father (Jason Bateman) is just a sketch, a writer's contrivance. Director Jason Reitman ultimately plays things a little safe, softening the material's edges and making the scenario prettier and friendlier than it might have been in other hands.

","Juno was one of my favorite films of 2007. The dialogue was perfect, the performances were perfect, and the comedy was perfect. The entire film was perfect. But here comes the weird part... it was written by a stripper. Diablo Cody(I don't think that is her real name) wrote this fantastic film. In my opinion, it wasn't my favorite film of 2007, but it was one of the best. My favorite film of 2007 wasn't even nominated. That film was Sweeney Todd, you may disagree, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I had only seen Ellen Page in one film before this film. I didn't even realize that Juno was an X-man. Juno is dramatic, funny, witty(They might mean the same thing) and fantastic. Ellen Page deserved that Oscar over Tilda Swinton in Michael Clayton. Swinton didn't even do that much in that film, Page does a ton more in this film. <br/><br/>Ellen Page plays a teenager named Juno Mcguff. One day she realizes that she is pregnant. So she wants to put the baby up for adoption. Juno soon stumbles across Mark and Vanessa Loring(played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman).<br/><br/>All of the performances in the film are fantastic. I left out a few people though. I forgot about Michael Cera from Superbad. Does he really ever do a bad job in a film? No. J.K. Simmons, who will do good in any film he is in, is fantastic in this film. I loved Allison Janey as Juno's stepmother Bren. There is one scene when they go and see the ultra-son tech. Janey shines in that scene. ""I'm a nail technician and I think we should both stick to what we know"". It's awesome. I loved Juno because it's a big hearted dram and comedy and, and... I could go on forever.

","And that is how this movie started. The story of a sixteen year old girl named Juno who was knocked up by a kid on the track team. But obviously, if that were the case of the movie, I give this movie worse than a seven.<br/><br/>So the movie starts off with Juno testing to see if she is pregnant at a pharmacy (special guest appearance of Rainn Wilson and a hilarious appearance if I may say) and then it is a official when Juno sees the plus sign on the reader, she is pregnant. So she tries to go for abortion, but is somehow scared out of doing so. After that, Juno and her friend decide that the best bet for Juno is to look for a couple that want to have a child. And they find the Lorings, who are in complete joy after having the offer to have Juno's baby.<br/><br/>This movie was alright to watch, but not the most entertaining. For one thing, the movie was a bit artistic and acted like an indie movie. And to tell you the truth, the indie-like portrayal would work great for a film like this one that has a rather simple plot. However, the creativity that I was looking for was not supplemented in this film. Maybe it is creativity other moviergoers would like, but definitely not me. And the soundtrack was annoying. It is basically alternative folk music and while at times you can zone it out, other times, it can really be in your face.<br/><br/>I watched this movie to answer the question I had in mind: how did this movie win an Oscar for best original screenplay and got nominated for best actress (Page), best director, and best picture? And by the end of the film, there was no answer. Because this movie really did not deserve those Oscar nominations. Page's acting was not terrible, but certainly not Oscar-nominated worthy. Juno in this film was supposed to be a rather sarcastic girl. At times, she would be funny. At others, she would be annoying. The overall movie really was not special because I believe that if some movie has the potential to win best picture, the plot or storyline should be more than just what Juno gives. I wanted more depth in this film.<br/><br/>For the other actors and actresses in the movie, you got Micheal Cera being, well, Micheal Cera. I do not have a sound sample in this comment, because according to my friends, I make a good Cera impression. But if you have seen the other movies he has been, do not think that since this movie has to do with deeper matters than his other movies he has starred in, Cera is going to perform any different. He is the same. Also, you can not go wrong for J.K. Simmons in this movie. He acts alright with being the father of Juno. And the cameo of Rainn Wilson was cool as well (being a fan of the Office). The rest of the cast is just decent acting to me.<br/><br/>Overall, if you really want to contemplate about your teenage life (if you have one), go ahead and knock yourself out in watching this film. I do not care for teenage drama that is portrayed in this movie or in real life. Call me ignorant if you may, I still thought this movie is alright and not the way I wanted it to be. But there were some parts that I found somewhat amusing.<br/><br/>I am pondering over a high 6 to a low 7."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","4","19 June 2009"," ""Juno"" delivers in every aspect
","Teen pregnancy movies that are usually about as predictable as ""Titanic"" -- inevitably (barring abortion) the baby will be born. There's your ending. But no movie has handled it like ""Juno."" Not even 2007's summer hit comedy ""Knocked Up"" can claim it does the pregnancy plot better, or funnier. ""Juno"" and it's fantastic smart-mouthed, sarcastic titular character ends up telling a story about something bigger than unplanned parenthood. And as much as first-time writer Diablo Cody candy-coats just about every verbal exchange with fancy dry humor, it's her story that makes ""Juno"" a real winner.<br/><br/>Juno is a 16-year-old girl who get pregnant because she and her long-time friend Paul were ""bored."" She's a rebel type who's into punk rock and slasher movies and she's fond of turning conversations away from social norms. Although she might seem like a stereotype at first, she handles her new problem like any of us would. 20-year-old Ellen Page (""X3: The Last Stand"") gives us the humorous character portrait and so much more. We watch Juno become more than just a teenager in this film because of her ability to step back from the humor when necessary and show us real feelings.<br/><br/>""Juno"" might seem like it's riding the label of independent comedy, but don't let its off-beat folk soundtrack or sketch-animated promotional materials dissuade you -- it's completely accessible to mainstream tastes. Director Jason Reitman who made success from a once independent ""Thank You For Smoking"" brings the same skill set to ""Juno."" Just like that film, Reitman demonstrates a great understanding of what the story is about at heart, even if that story is set to acoustic guitar and restrained vocals.<br/><br/>What it's really about, pardon the delay, is love. ""Juno"" is a love story, an epiphany and a statement about love as seen through a life-altering event in a young girl, who despite her sharp tongue, has barely scratched at the surface of what life is. Bringing this home are the adoptive parents in the film played by Jason Bateman (""Arrested Development"") and the lovely Jennifer Garner. They appear to be the ideal wealthy suburban parents for Juno's unborn baby, but their longing for a child, particularly Garner -- the obsessive parenting book- reading mother-to-be -- has overwhelmed their relationship. <br/><br/>Garner gives a particularly touching performance: While most of the other adult characters like Juno's father and stepmother (J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney) come with humorous quirks, her role remains the most dramatic, reminding us that a teenage girl being pregnant and picking who she'll give the baby to from an easy-saver is more than just good comedy material in real life. That's not to knock the entertaining but honest performances of Simmons and Janney. Both are hilarious, but both have their heart-felt moments.<br/><br/>Cody impresses by taking a premise with a definitive set of consequences (teen pregnancy) and turning it into a good comedy and then some more. Although some of the fancy dialogue is off-target from the central plot, it doesn't dictate the story being told. Cody makes sure that the wit is only decoration that makes for a more entertaining take on what can be cliché dramatic events."
"Jay09101951","10","1","4","25 March 2009"," Just a Wonderful film
","This is one of those movies that just grabbed me and has never let go. The story, the acting and the entire production is just terrific. I think it should be a movie all 16 year old kids should see. Every time I read a news story about a dead newborn child being found in a garbage bag I want to cry. This film simply shows that there is NO reason for that to happen. It's been said that both Pro-life and Pro-choice groups have praised this film. No surprise to me. Just that fact tells you how different this film is. You can't help but fall in love with Juno, Her Dad, Her Stepmom and her boy friend. What else can be said about this touching, just simply wonderful movie."
"hnt_dnl","5","1","4","20 January 2009"," Interesting, quirky film, but shouldn't have been an Oscar contender
","I'll admit it. I typically don't like films like JUNO. Supposedly an independent flick (feels more like typical Hollywood fare to me), it tells the 9-month story of precocious, 'adult' teenager Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page in an impressive performance for a young actress), who on an urge to have sex, accidentally gets impregnated by too-young-to-know any-better Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera, who really annoyed me whenever he was on screen). <br/><br/>I've got to say, that while I enjoyed JUNO a tad more than I thought I would, I absolutely hated the seemingly surprise ending of Juno deciding she loves this loser! I was kind of OK with the flick until it took this U-turn. This is the main part I hate about the film: Juno loves THIS guy? He's an uber-teen who doesn't know a damn thing about anything! And the film actually has the nerve to portray the unexpected pregnancy as if it is all Juno's fault! Bleeker never tells his mother and gets away scot free! And he had the nerve to go off on her and make it seem like it was all her fault and never took ANY responsibility for his own actions. This ticked me off to no end! <br/><br/>Well, the film's plusses (which are few and far between) include some fine supporting work by Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons as Juno's stepmom and father, but I thought the best performances of the film really belonged to Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner (as prospective adoptive parents Mark and Vanessa Loring). Their storyline spoke to me much more than Juno's scattershot storyline, which I don't think was well done at all. All her folks and friend does are make snide comments and jokes about this pregnancy. This is not supposed to be a laugh-out-loud comedy, but the early finding-out-your-pregnant-having-to-tell-your-parents-dialogue is really played for pure laughs, which for the most part, are not that funny.<br/><br/>Diablo Cody was wrongly given the original screenplay Oscar for this rather juvenile script (no pun intended). It all felt like a gimmick to me when she won on Oscar night. I've always thought the Academy has given this award in particular to the more POPULAR than deserving choice, to kind of lighten up the evening (like when they gave it to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck for GOOD WILL HUNTING) to see what kind of antics would ensue. Let's give the award to the scantily-clad, tattooed former stripper and see what happens! THIS is why the Oscars should not be taken seriously!"
"samuelsson91","8","1","4","5 January 2009"," Juno is the most touching film with ironical tone
","A current theme: pregnancy in 16. This happened to Juno. Juno is a romantic movie, which is analyzed very deep; it is very emotive and analyzed from every point of view. The script “was made” for Ellen Page, so she did a great job. The actress- performance is a little bit static, but it is excused, because 90% of camera shots are on her face. Except of “pregnancy problem”, they are discussing questions of friendship, marriage; not on a level we can see in other American movies. Much more “childish”, which is great because it is more understandable. The only thing I did not like is that all problems are solved with a happy end. But this is not how it works in real life. If I try to talk about a thing deeply (and this film is trying to do it), then with all negatives and positives. Juno is the most touching film with ironical tone I have seen in the year 2008. Definitely you should watch it!"

","I heard so much a bout this film, some of my friends said it was good others said it wasn't, so then I watched it and thought wow guess they were right it is a good movie. Ellen Page is a great actress as to be so young and play such a grown up like roll and she does it so well. To me and in my opinion this movie is more drama than it is comedy but still it's good and it deals with a very modern issue about teenage pregnancies, obviously this movie will have teen using condoms. I was actually hoping for this movie to be funnier but that doesn't mean that it's not entertaining, I was actually so interested in the film I didn't really care about the lack of comedy, hopefully you guys will enjoy this film as much as I did."
"paudie","8","1","4","5 November 2008"," Fast Talking But Heart Warming
","I enjoyed this film a lot. The story is relatively simple. A schoolgirl gets pregnant and decides to put the baby up for adoption. She happens to be a wisecracking smart ass, perhaps enough to be really annoying. In fact she seems such a know it all you wonder how she got herself into this trouble at all! However the film makes it clear however that Juno, despite trying to be uber mature, is still just a young girl. <br/><br/>Have no doubt, this is a ""feelgood"" film. Nearly all the characters are basically decent people and the plot is tied up perhaps too neatly. The development of Juno's relationship with her step mother would nearly bring a tear to your eye alone. The different story lines in the film are combined well together by the director, such as Juno's relationships with the prospective adoptive parents and with the father of the baby. <br/><br/>Great performances all round really make the film. Page, Cera, Garner,Bateman, Janney and Simmons are all excellent. For a few laughs and maybe a few tears watch this film."

","I don't see why people are so critical of this movie. The emotion and truthfulness of the situation is amazing.<br/><br/>Page does a great job a portraying the character of Juno and the shift of the character. The dark humor that Diablo gives for Juno is classic.<br/><br/>If anyone has a problem with it, it is because they go in expecting the greatest independent film of all time. and it isn't but it is a good movie and on a topic that would not normally be talked about. so I do believe that Diablo deserved that Oscar.<br/><br/>In all if you haven't seen it rent it. sit down with your girlfriend, pop some popcorn and have a good night."
"sarsipius23","9","1","4","17 October 2008"," I loved it!
","Indie movies and me generally do not get along. This one, however, I found very refreshing and entertaining. I liked Juno from the start and that is why I loved it. Not to mention I was surprised at the twists that resulted from the relationship between Juno and the adoptive couple (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner.) The only real negative is some of the music. It is too often ""cutesy"" or ""indie"" or whatever. It simply sucks sometimes.<br/><br/>I have been a huge Jason Bateman fan since Silver Spoons. He obviously had great acting and comedic talent even then (which sadly Ricky Schroeder did not have.) He was brilliant in ""It's Your Move."" In short, he's always been great. He was again great here. He is good enough that Oscar should come looking his way.<br/><br/>Back to the movie. The dialogue was funny, hip, and fit Juno's personality perfectly. The simplistic view she had of the world and her situation is exactly what a smart, smart- mouthed but good hearted teen would have. The little touch of the runner's running by was endearing and often funny. Having been a cross-country/track runner myself, I identified with it more than some perhaps. When we first meet Bateman and Garner I did not know what to expect and at first got pretty much what I would have guessed: a happy, yuppie, childless couple looking for a way to start a family. The later opening up of Bateman's character through a shared love of music and pop culture with Juno really made his character come alive, as well as the movie. Bateman's obvious attraction to Juno is exactly what most men would feel in the same circumstance (much like Timothy Hutton's feelings toward Natalie Portman in Beautiful Girls.) Meet a young beautiful girl who thinks like you, is creative like you, is easy to talk to and be around, and it is easy to see yourself falling for such person. The fact that Juno did not recognize the relationship as possibly romantic shows the true naivety both of women in general and of teenagers. Men will recognize Bateman's feelings as true and legitimate while women will likely be (like Juno) horrified and shocked at Bateman's brushing aside his marriage vows, no matter how unhappy he is. <br/><br/>Garner did fine but as a man I did not identify as much with her. I was sad that she would be raising the baby alone. I also was somewhat sad that the baby would not be part of Juno and her boyfriend's life. I wondered whether she would ultimately decide to keep the baby. I thought she might considering how difficult giving up your own flesh and blood would be. One thing that rung false was the high school Asian girl alone picketing an abortion clinic. Overall, I thought the movie was great!"
"lotzofluv38","10","1","4","2 October 2008"," Juno Movie Review
","If I were pregnant at 16, I would probably go into a deep depression from all of the shock and my parents would probably kill me and then kick me out of the house. In this dramatic 2007 comedy, 16-year-old Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) gets impregnated by her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), after one night with him and a living room chair. After overcoming the initial shock and surprise of the ""plus sign"", she decides that the best solution for this unexpected pregnancy would be an abortion. However, she changes her mind and decides to have the baby. Since she is only a junior in high school, she decides to give it up for adoption to Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), who she found were looking to adopt through the Pennysaver. Will Juno's sarcasm get her through the four different seasons of the movie  Autumn, Winter, Spring, and Summer? And will she be able to carry through with the adoption, or change her mind and keep the baby for herself? Although in Juno (PG-13), directed by Jason Reitman, there were many parts of the movie that were believable, there were also many parts that were not believable to the audience. For example, who finds abortion clinic workers who talk about the sex that they have with their boyfriends to the people who come in? Who finds adoptive parents in an ad newspaper? Who finds parents to be so calm and relaxed when they find out their 16-year-old daughter is having a baby? The believability of the plot was just not there. It was simply unrealistic. Even the way that the main characters, especially Juno, talked throughout the movie is not the way that teenagers or people in general talk like today. I have never heard anyone use as much sarcasm as Juno MacGuff. Besides the fact that Juno had an unrealistic spin on a 16-year-old getting pregnant in high school, the movie was still put together quite well. The acting was one of the things that stuck out the most. The actors and actresses were chosen perfectly for their roles in this movie. Page, although she is five years older than the part, represented a 16-year-old tomboy who just got pregnant. She used more than enough sarcasm all throughout the movie, making anything she said, a ""laugh out loud"" moment. Cera, who is four years older than the part, played a scared and confused boy, who is now the father of a baby. Together with Page, they played the perfect couple since they were complete opposites. Cera did funny things, like putting deodorant on his inner thighs before running, while Page simply said funny things. Although the plot was unrealistic, the acting was believable because they took their lines and made them their own, and because of this, it made the movie not only appealing to teenagers, but also to young adults. Besides the acting being entertaining, the soundtrack was another thing that kept the viewers entertained throughout the movie. The music that was chosen matched perfectly with the sarcasm. The Moldy Peaches played an important part in the soundtrack since their songs comprised most of it. Their music is corny, but it fit with the emotions and with the humor that the movie was trying to portray. One of the major songs that is played a few times in the movie is ""Anyone Else But You,"" one of their hit songs. One of the times this song is played is at the end of the movie in a scene with just Juno and Paulie. This whole scene is full of emotion, and similarly, so is this song. Not only were the songs used as symbols, but there were also symbols hidden among the plot. One of the main symbols was the runners, who always seemed to be running. These runners' symbolized two things  the transition of the seasons from autumn to summer and also ""to keep moving on."" They were symbolizing to Juno that she should not give up just because she got pregnant; her life was not over and she should ""keep moving on."" Another part of the movie that made it more appealing to the viewers was the camera angles, as well as the framing and the shots that the director used. One of the most significant things that the director did throughout the movie was the close-up shot. This was used in many of the scenes to show the emotion on the actors and actresses faces, since the movie got more emotional as time progressed through the seasons. Another part of the movie that was very important to the plot was the setting. The setting of Juno most likely occurred in any state in a small town. The importance of the small town being the major setting in the movie is that when Juno got pregnant, the whole town knew and in small towns, everyone knows everyone's business.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved this movie. I would give it a ""thumbs up"" because of the acting, the aspect of pregnancy awareness and the appeal to teenagers, especially to teenage girls. Although this movie was very entertaining and funny, it was simply a story about life, a story about growing up and the bumps along the way."
"herb_at_qedi","9","1","4","30 September 2008"," Juno Flows with the Universe
","Juno is, unapologetically, who she is. Life is a journey, not a destination, and Juno seems to appreciate that more than most of us. Hers is a journey of self-discovery, marked by choices she never expected to make. Along the way, she learns something that many of us never seem to learn -- most especially the many reviews I read condemning this movie on ""moral grounds"" -- not to take ourselves or life too seriously. In many ways, Juno is innately very ""zen"" in that she instinctively realizes that she cannot control the feelings or actions of those around her any more than they can truly control her. If you can, without preconceptions, enjoy watching this type of teenager grow with her experiences on an understated human scale, you will enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can insist on criticizing the movie for the hype, its lack of ""moral values"", its ""cliched"" dialog (only if you don't live there - clichés become clichés because they start out as truths), or its lack of misanthropy, then you can feel good about how superior you are to idiots like me who thoroughly enjoyed Juno."

"jboothmillard","8","1","4","12 July 2008"," Juno
","Most American teen comedies are full of sex and filth (obviously that's what makes them great), but this one is more grown up, more drama really dealing with a common subject, from Oscar nominated director Jason Reitman (director of Thank You For Smoking, and son of Twins director Ivan). Basically 16-year-old Juno MacGuff (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Ellen Page) is the sassy, clever teenager loses her virginity to best friend Paulie Bleeker (Superbad's Michael Cera), their not exclusive boyfriend/girlfriend. Not long after this, Juno takes three pregnancy tests, and they are all positive, so she originally considers abortion. But when she sees so many other girls in her situation, and goes against her original intention, and decides to have the baby. She explains the situation to her parents, father Mac (Spider-Man's J.K. Simmons) and mother Bren (The West Wing's Allison Janney), she wants a couple to adopt the baby when it is born. From a local newspaper she finds what she thinks is the perfect couple who want to adopt a baby, Vanessa (Elektra's Jennifer Garner) and Mark Loring (Dodgeball's Jason Bateman), and even though Juno puts on a confident attitude (with ""post-Dawson's Creek"" dialogue), she is just as anxious and confused as any girl in her situation would be. Everything seems to be going okay, Juno signs a contract to have no contact with the baby after it is born, and she gets to know the couple much better, she is pleased with Mark's love of grunge music and horror films, but Vanessa is more uptight, and more eager than Mark for the baby. There is a point where only a while away from giving birth, Mark and Vanessa break apart, but Juno understands Vanessa's eagerness, and decides that if Mark doesn't want it as much as her, then Vanessa should still be able to witness the birth. In the end, Vanessa gets her child, and Juno and Paulie seem to form a much closer relationship, so, a happy ending for all who need one. Also starring Olivia Thirlby as Leah, Eileen Pedde as Gerta Rauss, Rainn Wilson as Rollo and Daniel Clark as Steve Rendazo. Page gives a remarkable performance as the sassy, pregnant teen, and there is welcome support by Simmons and Janney as her parents, the comedy mainly comes from Page's confident attitude and the witty dialogue, it does excel slightly more as a drama, but both combinations make this a classy independent film. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Screenplay. Very good!"

It is hard to think that somebody like Diablo Cody can take such a serious issue like teen pregnancy and make it a total laugh. Also as a 16 year old male I really can relate to some of the characters (not the weird ones). <br/><br/>This really is one of the true cult films targeted at young people and I highly recommend it..."
"super-joey","8","1","4","3 June 2008"," Simple Fun With Characters I Cared About
","I won't call Juno ""great"" but I did enjoy it. It's a simple movie but there's no rule that says every indie film has to be complex. This movie had something that not every movie has... It had characters I CARED about and I wanted to know what would happen to them. That alone puts it a cut above at least half the trash that's released these days.<br/><br/>Along the way we get some funny (though low key) dialog. I didn't find the pop culture references bothersome as some reviewers here did. The fact is, if you listen to how people talk, our conversations ARE often infused with pop culture references. That's life.<br/><br/>And speaking of life, there are many reviewers here who seem angry at this movie for its supposed pro-life stance. This is nonsense. Yes, Juno decides not to have an abortion and gives her baby up for adoption instead. This has caused shouts of ""neo con"" from some people. Huh? Just because somebody chooses to have their baby, they are a neo con? I thought the essence of ""pro choice"" was that you get to CHOOSE. Are you ""pro choice"" or pro abortion? <br/><br/>If you are bothered by a story about a pregnant teenage girl giving her baby up for adoption, ask yourself why. Is it because you are disturbed by the idea of a pregnant teen? Join the club. Everyone is bothered by teenage pregnancy (to some degree) and this movie deals with that. Even Juno is bothered by it. <br/><br/>But if you're offended because she didn't choose abortion, you are reading too much into it. I don't think this movie was trying to make any sweeping political or social statements. It's not a movie ABOUT her choice between adoption and abortion. That's just 1 scene! And it's sad that a fictional character can't choose adoption without pissing people off. Just calm down and enjoy the freakin' movie."

","OK a lot of the negative comments on this movie tend to follow the same basic formula, this movie is not realistic and ""NORMAL PEOPLE wouldn't react this way"". <br/><br/>Did anyone stop to think that the point of this movie was specifically NOT to imitate real life. Art can imitate life, or art can comment on life or paint a picture of what the author thinks life should be.<br/><br/>The situation is not ideal or what some would consider normal, the teenagers were totally irresponsible. and the parents did not freak out and scream and yell.<br/><br/>Points I see good about the movie. While tons of movies have dealt with teenage pregnancy few have taken such a realistic tone on the subject of abortion. It wasn't preachy and didn't push a pro-life or pro-choice agenda on you she weighed both options and did what she felt was right, without resorting the the typical ""NOONE should ever have a abortion or their evil crap""<br/><br/>People dis this movie because of parents didn't scream and freak out. OK maybe that's normal but what good does it really do. does it make the teenager not pregnant by ranting and raving at them, NO it accomplishes nothing except for adding stress to a teenage girl who already knows she screwed up big time and makes it harder for them to make good decisions. It's the screaming parents of the world that cause people so ashamed of their mistake to get the help they need in situations like this. Maybe the parent's weren't normal but if and when I'm a parent and if God forbid that happened to my teenager I really hope I could be as positive and helpful.<br/><br/>Maybe it wasn't realistic but in the end she did what was best for her baby, she gave it to someone that had the resources to take care of it. Some people need to realize that what's normal isn't always right and the way we treat this subject and expect people to react is just plain WRONG."
"neil-476","8","1","4","14 May 2008"," Pleasing, if lightweight
","One for comic fans - Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), J Jonah Jameson (JK Simmons) and Electra (Jennifer Garner) all in the same movie! Juno is a smart-mouthed 16-year old. Not so smart, though, that it isn't a bit of a surprise when she finds herself pregnant. By the time she tells Dad and step-Mom she's pregnant, she has already a) discounted having an abortion and b) set up a childless yuppie couple to adopt the baby once it arrives.<br/><br/>I watched this movie in an auditorium where the rest of the audience was teen-aged girls. As a man moving rapidly out of middle age in the wrong direction, this caused some weird moments when they laughed and I didn't, and vice versa. But it's that sort of movie. There are places where the humour is very much the sort of humour which will appeal to other smart-mouthed teenage girls: conversely, there are moments which brought back strong memories of my wife's pregnancies and the births of my kids.<br/><br/>Let me say that there isn't actually very much which happens in Juno. That doesn't matter, though - my attention was held all the way through. And, if the resolution of it all seems somewhat glib, and if there is some question as to the morality in the story - well, I don't have a problem with that, either. Like it or not, teenage pregnancies do occur, and it's better for parents to react constructively rather than recriminatively. It's also unarguable that a child being born in those circumstances is almost certainly better off being adopted than being left to the mercies of a 16-year old couple.<br/><br/>I found the characters in Juno to be engaging and real. There were laugh-out-loud moments, and the film as a whole was sweet and touching. All the cast performed well, but the two standouts were Jennifer Garner as a vulnerable wannabe mother, damaged by her childlessness, and Ellen Page, showing once again how effectively she can command the screen. I enjoyed this movie a great deal."
"bangor_09","8","1","4","10 May 2008"," An OK tale Without a morale whatsoever
","For starters the cast if made of some of my favorite actors and actresses, and it's cool to see that Jason Bateman it's making a comeback somehow successfully, and to boot, I have been a fan of Ellen Page ever since I saw her on ""Hard Candy"". Because of her acting skills, nothing more (yes, that should be a nice cover up).<br/><br/>The movie it's a great blend with comedy, drama and of course the mandatory sentimental moments, something clearly different for a year full of cinema violence and cynical humor, J.K. Simmons showed us that not only can act, he can actually talk with a normal speed and an normal voice The problem I had this movie, it's the morale, so in the end Juno found out that she was actually in love with her best friend, so it wasn't just pity sex what lead her to this whole situation, and when you find one that loves you just like you are, you should never let go that person. That's a cool morale, but I think I'm one of the few that actually remembers one thing: She's a minor who got pregnant and gave away her baby, and in the end both her and her boyfriend go back to their previous lifetime (but as a couple) without ANY regret or consequence of what just happened, or any moral that they actually learned something form said experience..<br/><br/>Of course an Abortion themed movie wouldn't have sold that good, or been on my movie list either, but the aforementioned detail makes this movie a guilty pleasure, if you just take the moral out Curse you Diablo Cody!!!

I had previously run across her in ""Hard Candy"" which is equally as compelling for this young actress as she commands your attention with her delivery and expression and in this vehicle, she is no less engaging with the skill of a seasoned veteran in a role.<br/><br/>It's a story about a teen but is far superior to any teen movie I've ever viewed. I recall ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" from years ago with the very serious undercarriage of moral dilemmas mixed with humor and reality. ""Juno"" took a good ""teen"" movie the step further with a slightly more complex tact but just as entertaining."

","Alright, I admit it. I am one of those people who usually prefers light, unrealistic stuff over reality when it comes to movies. Napoleon Dynamite was depressing for me. Though Juno mimics the reality, bleakness and failure of Napoleon Dynamite in many ways, it does it in a more humorous, encouraging way.<br/><br/>First of all, I was pretty surprised when people said that the character Juno was unrealistic and nobody they knew was like that. Personally, I loved Juno--she's like a cross between my two best friends, down-to-earth, offbeat, cynical, etcetera. While the hamburger phone and the orange tictacs weren't meant to be the focal point of the film, they added flavour. To the humour, I mean. And, you know it's true that everybody has their quirks.<br/><br/>I think people need to lighten up and take movies like this a bit less seriously. Especially the ultrasound scene--sure, I do know those shallow, selfish people who'd probably kill their babies without noticing, but I also know plenty of teens who'd be a perfectly competent parent, with a little support. And Juno? Pretentious? What?! In high school, there are classes. Those who are 'in', and those who are not. Juno is like my favourite group--in the middle. I believe it's called 'independant thinking'--consciously not conforming to fit in, but with the sensibility and social adeptness to not be completely out there. Surprisingly, here in the foreign (to most readers) land of Canada, there's more than a few of this type.<br/><br/>Juno's humour was written a bit off--she always says what everyone would really think of ten minutes after the opportunity had passed. At least a lot of the nifty little lines like her mom who sends her a cactus every Valentines Day weren't overlooked.<br/><br/>SO, I was definitely a lover, but mainly because I relate to Juno and her humour so well."

","I just went to go see Juno at The Plaza Theater in Calgary, AB and it was super cool. The ticket was only $9 and I got a huge pop and popcorn for $6. The big theater's like Famous Players and Cineplex can't even beat that price. This theater is super cool too because it's old as hell and has these beautiful red curtains and an old fashioned stage. I give this theater a lot of credit because you don't see independent movie houses around anymore. And I was just talking to a co-worker the other night at Blockbuster about the good old times when the family would pile in the family car and go to the drive-in. Rocky Horror and Reefer Madness are playing soon which I've seen those films before but because I loved the theater so much tonight I will for sure go back again.<br/><br/>The movie was totally awesome. I couldn't wait to see it on DVD and I love the big screen and surround sound at the theater. Nothing is like watching a film with other people. It makes the experience more intense. This film had great acting all around. I absolutely think the girl who played Juno is sweet and I love her in what I've seen her in so far. The kid from Superbad is awesome as Bleeker. Juno's parents are very funny and I love the father. Then you have Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner. I love Jason Bateman on Arrested Development but in this film he plays the douche bag husband who still wants to be a kid. I love the scene where Jason Bateman tells Juno he wants to divorce his wife and move downtown to work on his music career more. And Juno makes fun of him and calls him a failed musician who is stuck in the early 90's because his band opened for The Melvins. And Juno taunts him and says ""What would the Melvins think of your selling out"".<br/><br/>Great music selection for this film and almost all of this film was shot in British Columbia, Canada so that's awesome. I'm totally glad I got to the theater tonight instead of watching movies I get from Blockbuster on my Laptop which really sucks when you watch a movie. That's why the theater will never die! Downloading may one day totally keep people from renting videos as downloaded files are free and they don't skip like a DVD. But downloaded files will never look or sound as good as films do in the theater!"

If you're into vintage bicycles, make sure you also check out Henry's blue beauty in ""Fräulein Phyllis"" and, of course, Dupree's ride in ""You, Me And Dupree"".

Ellen Page and Jennifer Garner are amazing in the complementary parts of Juno, the reluctant teenage mother, and Vanessa, a thirty-something suburban WASP who can't expect to expect. The script, by first-time screenwriter and sometime stripper Diablo Cody, is both deadpan and deeply touching. Think of Juno as of a female and altogether more capable version of Jason Schwartzman's Max Fischer in ""Rushmore"". Juno's life is far from perfect, but her friends and relations form a circle of trust that helps her cope with the mixed emotions (and countless commonplace challenges) that come with teenage pregnancy. She has what may well be the coolest patchwork parents ever, a precocious cheerleader girlfriend holding her hand all the way through labor, and a nerdy on-again-off-again boyfriend who is there for her when it counts. All this is set to fabulous music, partly performed by the cast, and including ""A Well-Respected Man"" by the Kinks. Ray Davies, may he live forever."

In Ellen Page's extraordinary capable hands, she is also one of the more vivid personalities you are likely to encounter on the screen in many a year. Helped by Jennifer Garner as the young woman who will become her baby's mom and by J.K. Simmons as her supportive but befuddled dad, Ellen Page makes ""Juno"" into much more than a slight comedy.

","When your average cinema going joe public think of films featuring American teenagers they tend to think of titles like the 'American Pie' series of gross-out comedies, or the endless stream of slasher movies that seem to pollute the screens and DVD shelves these days (don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good slasher movie once in a while, but there are just so many of the about lately!) What they would not think of is a film like 'Juno' that, for possibly the first time since the early Linklater movies, deal with Amercian teenagers in a really mature, intelligent manner.<br/><br/>What I really like about this movie is that is does not set out for belly laughs by presenting us with gross-out comedy, but instead allows the comedy to grow naturally out of the situations presented, and by the naturalistic acting of the main characters. As Juno Ellen Page is outstanding, a possible star in the making. She is backed up by a near flawless supporting cast, with Micheal Cera being the stand out as the confused, upset, but ever loyal Bleeker. The scene in the hospital, with the two on the bed, was very moving without ever being sentimental.<br/><br/>A few last thoughts. The opening title sequence is magnificent, why can't more movies put more effort into great open title sequences? Then there is the music. The audience I watched the film with were mainly OAP's (it was a local matinée!), so the choice of music went over many of their heads, but I was secretly bopping along in my seat to some fantastic tunes. It was really interesting that Juno was given such taste in music, rather than what you would expect from a teenager in contemporary USA - or this a dig at the current state of music on that side of the pond? Despite the controversy of the issues raised - although personally I believe pro-choice also gives a women the right to have her baby - I believe that this is an ideal film to enhance your faith in both mankind and in intelligent film making"

","Juno was an excellent comedy for all ages, its a youthful adventure of one teenager who becomes pregnant by her close friend. The movie uses hilarious dialogue that wouldn't casually be said. Ellen Page does a superb job at acting as a pregnant teen. The whole plot is amazingly collaborated and put together to form a hilarious movie. The beginning of the movie is very creative, where is starts out as a drawing coming to live drinking sunny d, then it slowly transforms into real life. Just the way Juno acts and dresses like she's some tough teen invulnerable to all the effects of society's pressure and influence on her. She has a beat to her own drum, and doesn't follow or listen to the opinions of others except for her two best friends. This movie some may think is a remake of Napoleon Dynamite but it is simply pure genius."

This film is very light on it's feet. Ellen Page(X-Men 3) gives quite a memorable performance as the pregnant teen Juno, You just really like her, on moments when she is being nice or cynical, you just so drawn to her, she really makes you care about her.

"timtla","Null","1","4","22 February 2008"," Love Finds the Way
","I'm glad to write this review. So many times movies don't deal with love in real forms. But Juno at a older than years age of 16 has to ask herself questions of who she is, ""I don't really know what kind of girl I am."" In a non-pro life way, this movie helps her discover what it means to love, by choosing to give birth to her unexpected child and the journey from that choice.<br/><br/>When the movie begins, Juno, her friends, parents and boyfriend all act nonchalant about the pregnancy (summed up in the first minutes by the comments of the store clerk). Juno deals with the pregnancy as just another problem she needs to solve. The turning point comes at the abortion clinic when she rejects the assumptions of the ""unattached from emotions"" receptionist, and wants to believe life is greater.<br/><br/>It is in the pursuit of life and probably what it means to create life that she understands life requires the attachment to others. Juno helps another woman, Vanessa Loring (Jennifer Garner), fulfill her life's need for this attachment by allowing her to adopt the baby. And by the end Juno is able to feel the emotions of the greatest gift and important attachment life offers, giving birth to a new life.<br/><br/>Life is about Love, Attachment, Connection and our journeys to seek and find the source of that life. I'm a believer in an abundant life that comes when you discover that source. I hope Juno inspires others to seek and find also."

Her sarcastic behavior which is normal to teenagers now. But the one thing i liked about the character especially is how maturely she deals with her pregnancy, how she takes everything in her hands and searches down all the options before zeroing down to adoption. This is one thing which surely keeps this movie stand out from the other teen pregnant stories ever told. <br/><br/>Performances in the movie are also justifying to the characters but my favorite was Jennifer Garner in the movie. Her character as desperate woman seeing a chance of lifetime in front of her of adopting a child or becoming a mom which isn't able to be naturally. There are some funny moments that will make you laugh and also some that will touch you down really low in your heart.<br/><br/>From my side Juno is one of the movies released last year which every one should at least watch once."

","Juno is a very good indy film that shows the trials and tribulations of a 16 year old girl ( Ellen Page ) going through pregnancy and the trials that follow. Involved in this are her close friend/father of the child Paul ( Michael Cera ), her father ( JK Simmons ) and the two perspective adoptive parents ( Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner ).<br/><br/>Sounds like a good yarn- and it is. All of the characters are handled with care and there is an abundance of good lines. Both Page and Cera are very good in their respective roles, while out of the adults Simmons stands out as Juno's father. Having said that, it does have a couple of problems. One of which has to do with Jennifer Garner as the prospective mother who at times seems to be totally obsessed with motherhood.<br/><br/>The only real problem is that this film at times doesn't allow itself to be different naturally but seems to want ram it down the viewer's throat. The first 10 minutes of dialogue is bizarre for any 16 year old to say ( I'm a 23 year old Teacher and I have never heard anything like that ) and seems only to make people to accept it as quirky when it's going to be different if it's good enough. <br/><br/>Juno is a wondefully funny film that is let down slightly because it falls over itself to try and be different."
"deepthirteentempmike","3","1","5","12 December 2012"," Highly overrated
","I'm sorry, but I honestly cannot see why this film gets any sort of praise. My main issue with it is that it fails to deliver its message about the negative effects of teen pregnancy. The film's protagonist does not seem surprised in the slightest that she's having a child. She just scoffs and shrugs her shoulders as though she had a C on her math test. The film doesn't give the audience a chance to generate any sympathy for her, it's just a way of saying ""Hey, look! This is what'll happen when you're pregnant!"". The general message of the film is also sickening, ""if you have a child, no problem, just give it to a stranger couple and act as though it never happened"". While most of the time, the dialog can be quirky and cute and funny, it certainly does not make up for its pretense and overall hypocrisy. It's a lot like the 1989 film ""UHF"", humor wise, it's funny, but story wise, it's awful. Allow me to go off topic here about Roger Ebert's review of the film. Now, don't get me wrong, I love Ebert as much as the next person out there, but I can't help but point this out. He strongly criticizes the 2004 film ""Team America: World Police"" for having an oh-so nihilistic view of the war on terror, but has absolutely no problem seeing a teenager nonchalantly hand over her child to a couple of strangers. Why? At least with ""Team America"", it was intentionally sneering at both Democrats and Republicans, whereas in ""Juno"", it tries to explain about the negative effects of teen pregnancy and completely misses the mark. I could go on an hour long tirade about why I dislike this film, but I just wanted to give you the basics. I reiterate, funny, yes, quirky, sure, but best film of 2009, hell no."

I don't care for clever, coy, cutesy-poo teenagers -- particularly those who talk the way 30-year-olds imagine the young people are jiving these days. I don't like situations that are so far from reality that words and titles have lost all meaning. There is a lot for me not to like in this film.<br/><br/>But PLEASE. A bold, intelligent, perfectly rational girl who is utterly devoid of embarrassment (she has loud conversations with the jerky store clerk about the pregnancy tests she is buying and peeing on right there in the store)...who planned for a year to have sex with her friend...did not, somehow, manage to consider birth control? REALLY? Not even the free condoms available at the women's clinic? The women's clinic, where she walked right up to the protester and had a casual conversation before heading inside and, for no reason, decided not to have an abortion when that had been her plan so far? So: a serious situation trivialized in a melodramatic and unfunny way, with a brainless character glorified for horrible, half-baked likes such as ""Honest to blog""? No love.<br/><br/>Her working class parents have a ""Well, Shucks"" reaction that makes one wonder if Xanax was involved. When Samuel L. Jackson mocks Geena Davis in ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" by saying, ""Phooey, I burned the darned muffins,"" he was emoting far beyond these mellow folks. Same with her school. Folks, don't mistake Minnesota Nice for Minnesota Non-judgmental. It doesn't exist.<br/><br/>So basically, there is no pregnancy policy in her school, no social stigma, no complication to her health or pregnancy, no obstacle to treatment, no bills for medical services (tra-la!) -- and we are supposed to have anything invested in this charmless idiot? If you aren't going to give us a real girl, or a real situation, or even a real laugh, I'm not going to give a real damn. The only real character in the story is the honest swine who walks out on his marriage in order to be true to himself. Ugh.<br/><br/>I could go on all day about the idiocy, but let me sum it up with the fact that the character's name is Juno, after the goddess of motherhood.<br/><br/>She drives a Previa -- a real vehicle, but everyone should know ""placenta previa"" is a dangerous complication of pregnancy.<br/><br/>And her last name is MacGuff -- as in ""MacGuffin"", the term for a plot device that leads everyone around without having any weight or value. Just like the pregnancy in this movie.<br/><br/>I feel like the author was pretty openly stating that she doesn't care about the character, either. So why should we?"

","Juno has two separate levels - when taken as an offbeat comedy/drama, it's quite enjoyable, cleverly written, beautifully shot and exquisitely acted.

"JamesHitchcock","7","1","5","10 August 2011"," Sixteen Going On Thirty-Six
","In Roman mythology, Juno was the Queen of the Gods, and is normally portrayed as a tall, voluptuous woman, hence the adjective ""Junoesque"". The title of this movie was therefore presumably intended ironically, as the slim, petite Ellen Page, who stars as the title character, is about the least Junoesque actress one could imagine. She not only looks younger then twenty (her actual age at the time the film was made) but even looks younger than sixteen (the supposed age of her character).<br/><br/>The Juno in question is Juno MacGuff, a sixteen-year-old schoolgirl from Minnesota. (At least, the film is ostensibly set in Minnesota, although for financial reasons it was shot in British Columbia, that corner of Canada which is, at least in Hollywood's eyes, forever America). Juno discovers that she is pregnant by a boy named Paulie Bleeker. (Paulie is not quite close enough to be her regular boyfriend, but their relationship is obviously more than just platonic). Juno's initial reaction is to have an abortion, but is persuaded by her pro-life friend Su-Chin to change her mind. Deciding she is too young to care for the child herself, she makes arrangements to have it adopted by a wealthy local couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring. (The film suggests that in America, or at least in the state of Minnesota, adoption is a much more informal process than it would be in Britain. Juno actually finds the Lorings through an ad in the local paper).<br/><br/>At first, the Lorings seem like the ideal adoptive parents, although it soon becomes clear that there may be trouble ahead. The problem is that Mark and Vanessa are in many ways incompatible with one another. She is the ultimate conformist, whose ambition to become the all-American bourgeois housewife and mother has been frustrated only by the fact that she and Mark do not actually have any children. He is a non-conformist, a thirty-something teenage rebel who still hankers after the dream of becoming a rock star and, belatedly, sees the looming prospect of parenthood as a threat to that dream. Although not too much is made of it, there are clear hints in the script that Mark finds himself becoming romantically attracted to the child-woman Juno, something else which suggests he has never really grown up. Another strand in the plot is the progress of the romance between Juno and Paulie.<br/><br/>The film has, paradoxically, been criticised by both the religious right, who objected to what they saw as a glamorisation of teenage motherhood, and by the pro-choice camp regarding its treatment of abortion, although I am not sure that either side really has all that much to complain about. Juno, who is not presented as a particularly glamorous figure, does, after all, make a free choice to give her baby a chance of life, and is not pressured into it. (Her parents would much rather she had an abortion).<br/><br/>The film was the surprise hit of 2007. It was made on the very low budget of $6.5 million and featured only one major star, Jennifer Garner as Vanessa. Yet it earned more than $200 million at the box office, made a star of its leading lady, was highly praised by many critics and was nominated for several Academy Awards, winning a ""Best Original Screenplay"" Oscar for its oddly-named (or, since that is not her real name, perhaps I should say ""oddly-pseudonymmed"") scriptwriter Diablo Cody.<br/><br/>The film does indeed have some good qualities. Cody clearly has a talent for writing witty dialogue, and Page has a talent for speaking it. Her ability to put across her lines with a deadpan face reminded me of the young Christina Ricci, to whom Page bears a certain physical likeness. The main problem with the film for me was that Juno always seems just a little too much in control, able to deal with every situation calmly, rationally and to greet every setback with a sardonic wisecrack which would sound better coming from a practised stand-up comedian going through his routine than on the lips of a teenage girl. (Juno to Mark and Vanessa:- ""You should've gone to China, you know, 'cause I hear they give away babies like free iPods. You know, they pretty much just put them in those t-shirt guns and shoot them out at sporting events""). Physically, Juno might look like sixteen going on thirteen; mentally she seems to be sixteen going on thirty-six.<br/><br/>And emotionally she seems to be- well, actually, she doesn't seem to have all that much of an emotional life at all. Certainly not the emotions which one would normally expect a teenage girl to have when confronted with the unwelcome fact of an unplanned pregnancy. ""Juno"" is in many ways a smart, clever film, but its approach to its subject-matter is a bit too one-dimensional. It exploits the comic side to teenage pregnancy, but does no more than nod to the idea that there might be a more serious side. 7/10"
"enigmaticmaniac","7","1","5","2 July 2011"," Adorable Juno
","An unusual topic taken as the main plot of the movie. Yes it delivers much to the expectations. The whole script is very unusual and carried out well. Ellen Page as Juno makes the offbeat movie survive with a brilliant act. She's witty, funny and fun to watch. There are some comical conversations which keeps the movie on lighter air throughout. Though the screenplay is adaptive to develop interest in the female viewers more, men must still find it likable, a little less may be. Its about emotions, friends, situations, parenthood and decision making. The movie never gets stretchy and is enjoyable. Juno as a character is likely to stay deep in our hearts and you can't ignore but adore her throughout the movie. Though I feel it could have been better."

"karas_clothes","7","1","5","20 March 2011"," Quirky Sixteen-Year-Old Pregnancy
","The movie Juno is about a girl who is supposed to be an average sixteen-year-old. This sixteen-year-old gets pregnant and the rest of the movie describes her conception to delivery with little quirks and interesting expressions. When Juno (Ellen Page) gets pregnant, she attempts to get an abortion. After going to the abortion clinic and becoming completely freaked out she leaves, then she goes home and decides she needs to find parents to adopt her baby as she cannot raise it herself. Juno calls her best friend (Olivia Thirlby) and together they look through ads in the newspaper until they come across one that they both like. The ad had been posted by Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman), a somewhat out there, fairly well off, couple who Juno ends up befriending.<br/><br/>The theme of the movie Juno spreads across several categories. First, there are moral implications based on the decisions Juno has to make about keeping her baby and placing it up for adoption. Secondly, Juno contains the social problem of having an unwed sixteen-year-old child with no way of raising the child. In this day and age, there are several movies that describe the negative sides of carrying this baby to term. However, in this movie, the characterization is more upbeat. Obviously, Juno struggles with her own human dignity. She is forced to make decisions that test her wills, especially when it comes to Mark Loring. Juno takes a stance that is very courageous and impressive by telling him that he is a fool for breaking things off with his wife. Additionally, Juno is about the complexity of human relationships. An example of this is the interaction between Vanessa and Mark when they choose to split up and Juno's decision to allow Vanessa to raise the baby anyways. In addition, carrying a baby causes a huge loss of innocence and causes Juno to come of age. The film displays how much Juno grows up throughout the process by giving little hints along the way. Finally, Juno is a moral riddle. There are many sixteen-year-old girls that get pregnant and decide to get an abortion. This movie simply shows another side to this dilemma. <br/><br/>The lighting in Juno was used to symbolize the change of seasons as well as development. It was important to notice that the seasons had changed so that the viewer could follow along the stages of Juno's pregnancy.<br/><br/>I was extremely impressed by the amount of emotional growth that was displayed by Juno when the movie films back to the wall in the nursery where the note that Juno left on the Loring's door step is displayed. It simply states, ""Vanessa: If you're still in, I'm still in. —Juno."" One last support to Juno's character is the relationship with her father (J.K. Simmons.) The movie comes back to discussions between Simmons and Page several times, and helps guide the viewer to understand a bit more about who Juno is.<br/><br/>I would say that the motif in Juno is based around the chair and what it resembles in Juno's life. It was the place that the baby was conceived. It was the place where Juno told her boyfriend that they were pregnant and it was once again introduced when Vanessa is sitting in a chair rocking the baby at the end of the film. <br/><br/>The line at the end of the movie where Vanessa looks at Juno's step mom (Allison Janney) and says, ""how do I look?"" and Juno's step mom says, ""like a new mom, scared....,"" is priceless. At that point in the movie it's almost like all the emotional weight that had been baring down on Juno was then passed on to Vanessa. <br/><br/>Other films that came out the same year that Juno did, which show different complexities to this dilemma are Knocked Up and the Waitress. The difference between these three films is that Knocked Up and the Waitress are about young adults, whereas, Juno is more specifically about a young teen.<br/><br/>As I pointed out before, this film is about the emotional growth of a sixteen-year-old, I believe Ellen Page's portrayal is remarkable. Although the general theme of this movie isn't original, Ms. Page makes the movie outstanding. It is a movie that I will remember portions of for much time to come. Had it not been for Page's depiction, I do not believe this movie would have had the impact it did on me. Juno was an uplifting and tear-jerking movie which definitely touched my heart."
"The_Movie_Cat","7","1","5","30 September 2010"," Engaging but troubling...
","... up until the last ten minutes or so I was tempted to give this film an even higher mark.<br/><br/>Although it occasionally steers a little close to twee, and the soundtrack is self-conscious, it's a likable, relatively original film, and Ellen Page is an engaging and cute lead.<br/><br/>However, the pay off in the final ten minutes? ""Hey kids, you too can get pregnant and give the baby away with no emotional consequences whatsoever""? Sure, it's possible that some of the subtleties of this one passed me by with late night vodka, but regardless, a pat ending that discards any kind of emotional resonance or responsibility for its protagonists is a worrying thing indeed.<br/><br/>Still, a worthwhile cinema experience... to a point."
"epiczombietakeover","4","1","5","10 June 2010"," I've never wanted to punch a pregnant girl's stomach so badly...
","I rented Juno with high hopes of finding a quirky, humorous film that would live up to all of the hype that it received and what a I witnessed was a hack job on all sides of the spectrum. The writing (by former stripper, Diablo Cody) seems to be a soulless mess of simplistic wit and obscure references. Juno is hardly a teenage girl, much less any kind of a movie character. If she's supposed to be this smarmy teenage girl who follows her heart and is her own kind of person, wouldn't she be a little bit devastated to realize that she was pregnant? I guess not, since she handles it like she just got the stomach flu. Does this not send the message to teenage girls that ""HEY KIDS! It's okay to be pregnant at your age, because your creepy step mom who collects dog pictures and stupid blonde friend won't mind at all and your life will be totally undisturbed except for the weirdo yuppies that want to adopt your kid."" Honestly? The acting leaves much to be desired. Ellen Page does very little with the leading role (not that there was much for her to work with). Michael Cera is bland (as usual). The final thing in this movie that I hated beyond all meaning was the indie track that played in the background that made my ears want to bleed. LEARN HOW TO TUNE A GUITAR PEOPLE!"
"hopper-21","9","1","5","31 January 2009"," People trash talk because they don't know anything
","There are so many people here that criticize the film because they can't see the merit in it. Why the hell do you think it won an Oscar? That definitely wasn't for nothing...I believe in the opinion of the critics, because they're the ones that focus and appreciate the film the most. An opinion is worthless if it's coming from someone who didn't watch the film carefully or just brushed it off as another 'teen flick'. Have you ever looked at the proportion of so called 'moving' teen movies to 'moving' adult movies (movies starring adults)? Well I can tell you that this world is unbelievably prejudiced against all teen movies. I'll admit that most teen movies are oriented mostly towards teens, so maybe they're a little shallow, but that doesn't mean that all teen movies are like that. Don't base your opinion on the age of the players in a story, is all I'm saying. Try and base your opinion on the execution of the movie, the quality of the characterization, the flow, and the goddamned things that do matter.<br/><br/>That being said, I really liked Juno because personally, I felt like the film showed a more modern view of the personalities of teens. Juno carries the traits of typical teens: sarcastic and rude, but she also has courage and strength and a proactive view on her life. Some douches say that Juno is too shallow and annoying, but dude, she is just a teenager. Some people say that she acts all witty and bright but if so, why didn't she know to use contraceptives? Once again, she's just a freakin teenager. Teenagers can make mistakes, just like adults do when they have an ""accident baby."" She's a teenager having her first sex in her life...she's curious, she's naive, she's a TEEN. She's SUPPOSED to be like that; it's reality. As for her unique personality; it's called characterization. I don't think I've ever remembered a teenager's personality like I have Juno's. No, all teenagers do not act the same. They don't need to be all Disney channel mannequins or sickly sweet Sydney Whites. Personalities extend beyond canon; there's no limit to how weird someone can act. So quite frankly people, please get out of your conch shells and take a damn good look at the world.<br/><br/>Others say that Juno sets a bad example for kids: a happy outlook on pregnancy, coarse jokes and teen behavior, irresponsible parents, etc etc.<br/><br/>Sure, Juno has a setting of a pregnancy, but I think what the film is really trying to show is that you can have a problem but be happy at the same time. NOT ALL TEEN MOVIES ABOUT PREGNANCY NEED TO BE SAD, because what does that say to teens? That if they're pregnant, life's over? No, this film is different because it's trying to illustrate that ITS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD ONCE YOU SCREW UP. Juno's family may not be perfect and she herself isn't the model student, but they all persevere through this dilemma with a good outlook. Little Miss Sunshine ended on a good note, yet you know it's not advocating being gay or doing drugs or crashing beauty pageants. Be positive, stay strong, no matter what crap blows your way. I think that's the main point this movie is trying to make.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm just trying to show how much our prejudices affect our opinion. Juno's a great movie, so don't hate it unless you base your opinion on something plausible."
"treadwaywrites","7","1","5","9 January 2009"," Juno is a Winning Film
","If you have even seen a single poster or commercial for this movie you know the plot. Teenage girl gets pregnant and deals with it. She deals with it in a smart upbeat and quirky way with loads of funny lines, plenty of quotable teenage banter and cool pragmatism. So it's pretty unrealistic. She gets pregnant after a one night stand. When faced with abortion she decides instead to have the baby and finds a couple on her own to adopt the baby. Now comes the nine months and the moments to string together a teenage comedy smarter than most.<br/><br/>Winning 2007 Best Screenplay Oscar, while handling 3 other nominations, was incredible for this small comedy made for only $2.5 million. This is typically unheard of for the Academy.Much of the success of this film is placed on the shoulders of the films young stars Michael Cera and Ellen Page. Along with proved director Jason Reitman, the hot light of Hollywood shone on this movie certainly due to the three of them.<br/><br/>There is no doubt this movie is funny and good for some belly laughs. The topic matter is controversial. Writing is fresh, hip and witty. But in the end the film still feels like a small comedy and the surprise is still socking that it has won so many awards across so many agencies. It's funny though. ***/****.<br/><br/>The poster is good since it conveys the movie's story pretty quick Some of the International posters offer a broader range, but I think it is the first style from the U.S. with the orange stripes that appeals to most people."
"thetrev","9","1","5","16 November 2008"," Hell, I enjoyed it!
","There seem to be a lot of reviews of this film, prior to this one, that complain about the reality of a street-wise 16-year-old kid getting pregnant and not, apparently, using contraception. Well, for realities sake, it is possible for contraception not to work, for people to use it incorrectly, for condoms to burst etc. Believe me, I know a few intelligent girls/women who thought they were OK and then started growing! So, please don't let that spoil your view of the film.<br/><br/>Other reviews ask how a 16 year old, born in the 1990's can be so knowledgeable about 1970's punk. Duh! I have 15, 16 and 17 year old students who listen to the Beatles and the Doors, for crying out loud.<br/><br/>Hey, i liked the dialogue, often quite clever and witty, liked the performances and generally enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>I must point out that at no point did I see any headings or signs which said this was either a documentary or a world-changing epic. So maybe that's why I took it as a piece of entertainment."
"tangerine_177","9","1","5","15 November 2008"," An enjoyable film..
","I went to see Juno by accident. I originally went to the cinema to see another film, but it was sold out and so I decided to watch Juno-and I wasn't disappointed. This could have been a typical teenager gets pregnant-has abortion-mopes a bit film..but it was nothing like that!<br/><br/>I felt that Ellen Page's acting was brilliant, she defiantly made the film and made the character of Juno so easy to relate to for a teenage audience. The support acting was also excellently done, and the actors just seemed to sink into their roles. I throughly enjoyed Juno's father and stepmother, I thought they were hilarious. <br/><br/>The reason I enjoyed this film, is that although it could be viewed as unrealistic, it shed such a positive light on teenage pregnancy, which is usually seen as such a dire, cliché issue. It was excellent to see a character who was headstrong, and didn't completely lose her head. Also a lot of the relationships, such as the one between Juno and her best friend are so similar to that of real life.<br/><br/>I believe that when you watch Juno, you have to keep in mind that it obviously isn't going to be 100% realistic, because if it was then it would be a boring film, it portrays a message that is that teenage pregnancy isn't the end of the world-although it is not a good thing. <br/><br/>On the other hand, two things that annoyed me about this film were the adoptive parents and the slang that was used. I thought that the adoptive parents were quite creepy- especially Vanessa, she was just a bit weird and over obsessive. The slang was sometimes so bad that it sent a shudder down my spine..especially the line""honest to blog"", i just can't stand it and who honestly says that?! <br/><br/>However, I did enjoy this film, its one of my faves, and I think its perfect when your in the mood for a quirky film, then this is defiantly the one to watch."

"Bunuel1976","6","1","5","16 September 2008"," JUNO (Jason Reitman, 2007) **1/2
","This film is a classic example of just how out-of-touch with modern cinema I find myself these days: while most critics seemed to fall over backwards in praising its simple qualities (a prerogative of so-called “Indie” film-making, and which here has more to do with a certain freshness of approach and the insight it gives into the problems effecting today’s youth than for any intrinsic artistic merit), I wasn’t sufficiently engaged in any of it to be more than slightly bemused by the plight of our spunky heroine. If anything, I was more concerned with the fact that a 16 year-old girl – and in her condition to boot – is allowed to drive a bulky motor vehicle! <br/><br/>Still, though about (and presumably aimed at) kids going through Juno’s same predicament i.e. the unforeseen repercussions of becoming “sexually active” at a tender age, the Oscar-winning script (by an ex-stripper!) is rather too smart for its own good: are we to honestly believe that girls so young could ever be into vintage Punk music and Euro-Horror films? Besides, it’s too often overwritten (being somewhat obsessed with product placement) – thus making the would-be authentic dialogue feel more than a bit awkward at times. The film, at least, is short enough at 96 minutes not to overstay its welcome…even if, in the long run, it’s mainly tolerable for Ellen Page’s genuinely disarming Oscar-nominated lead performance.<br/><br/>The other female characters that feature in the narrative tend to be outspoken (Juno’s stepmom), bossy (the intended adoptive mother for Page’s child played by Jennifer Garner) or kooky (the protagonist’s best friend). In this respect, our heroine’s symbiosis with Garner’s failed rocker husband Jason Bateman (from TEEN WOLF TOO [1987]!!) was a nice touch – though Juno’s own continuing relationship with the geeky boy who impregnated her isn’t exactly interesting or even credible. Finally, the whole is so obviously the work of an inexperienced director: in fact, he relies way too heavily on pop/rock tunes (via an admittedly eclectic, if occasionally bizarre, line-up) to expound on the characters’ feelings throughout – which, then, has the unfortunate effect of diluting whatever comment was intended to be made in the first place! Indeed, why do today’s film-makers keep shoving their musical tastes in our faces – especially when, as in this case, he (or any of his main characters) wasn’t even around when some of that music (for instance, The Velvet Underground’s “I’m Sticking With You”) was originally released?"

","Juno is a different movie that is I believe aimed at a niche market. It shows themes and ideas from a newer generation and pop culture and is not meant to be understood by everybody.<br/><br/>The previous comments I have read on this site seem to miss the point, that this movie has been made according to newer ideas and different ways of thinking than 10+ years ago. The western world is a fast paced place and is hard to follow popular culture today. Juno is a good representation of those people who are alternative, those people that don't quite fit into the mainstream population. It takes a different type of person to understand this movie. Someone who has come from a broken family, who relishes in being different from everybody else.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie thoroughly and I believe it does touch on a very important topic in popular or alternative culture today. There are people out there who do think like Juno did in the movie and some people may be too one minded (no offense and everybody to themselves) to comprehend this.<br/><br/>Juno represents modern and alternative lifestyle amazingly well and I would like to see more movies made like this.

"angelshalz","7","1","5","18 July 2008"," Is it really THAT charming?????
","It does have a witty dialogue, it is unique, but somehow I could neither relate to it nor get really entertained. First of all, Juno seems to be the right teenager to get pregnant. She's strong, high headed, down to earth and convincing. And at the same time she does not always play it safe. Her family is extremely supportive and the boy that she sleeps with is her best friend (sensitive type) that loves her. Also, she manages to find the PERFECT person (Jennifer Garner) to adopt her to-be-child. In all reality, a person is not that lucky. It is ten times worse to be pregnant as a teenager. But then again, Juno is the type of person that seems to have it all and can pull through, even with humor, love and charm in her life. Another important thing is that she is still finding herself and is not sure about her future or her goals. So it wouldn't be a life long scar, discouraging her to be the way she always wanted to be. I am sure that in general people will have a lot more pressure to face when they test positive. Anyways, the background music is so attuned to the main character and the movie's flavor that I was impressed. I am positive that this is not a let-down movie but if you are highly religious and are against the main theme of it, PLEASE don't take your chances and go watch it"

A one of a kind soundtrack, the best acting you could want from a whole cast etc etc.<br/><br/>The only reason why I gave it a 7 is just because its not my kind of movie, but if I had to rate objectively it would most certainly be a 10."

","First off, the film was very entertaining and held your interest throughout. Ellen Page was very engaging as Juno and her constant witty banter is what the movie was really all about. Forget everything else; the dialogue was smart and very funny. Not that for one minute I would think any 16 year old would be capable of flawless ,witty commentary and comebacks every time she opened her mouth. She really did seem like Gidget on crank. The yuppie couple played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner seemed tragically realistic. I've met many upwardly mobile couples who share their bland , self-centered personalities. Bateman was going through an internal dilemma halfway through a midlife crisis and not accepting the responsibilities of growing up. Garner's character seemed like the over educated, hyper serious type who is probably a real pain to be around after awhile. These two yuppies were doomed to self-destruct their marriage. The abortion clinic scene was real and ultimately uplifting. Juno's parents seemed supportive, yet distant. Her boyfriend was a total cypher; a drip's drip. Yet I could see how a gabby sixteen year old girl could fall madly in love with someone who just happens to be her ""type"". The ending was a disappointment because I feel Garner's character was icy and fragile; not good mom material - and single."
"hall895","7","1","5","23 June 2008"," A nice little movie
","Every once in a while there comes along a nice little movie which becomes a cultural phenomenon. When this happens all perspective tends to get lost and amidst all the breathless hype people overlook the fact that it's really just a nice little movie. And then comes the inevitable backlash as those who didn't like the movie get fed up with all the hype and declare it to be the worst thing they've ever seen. Such is the case with Juno. It's not the best movie of the year. It's not revolutionary. And it's certainly not the abomination its detractors would have you believe it to be. It's a nice little movie.<br/><br/>Seeing as the movie's a cultural phenomenon and all a plot summary seems rather unnecessary. Everyone knows the story...teenage girl gets pregnant and decides to give the baby up for adoption to childless yuppie couple. It's an incredibly simple story which plays out in such a way that the movie ends up being rather enjoyable and entertaining. Screenwriter Diablo Cody took home an Academy Award for her efforts but the film really is not brilliantly scripted. It is however brilliantly performed with director Jason Reitman coaxing wonderful performances out of his talented cast. All the performers are spot-on, falling into their roles perfectly. Of course the most important role belongs to Ellen Page playing Juno. The whole enterprise would have been sunk if Page was not up to the task but she does a truly outstanding job. With Page holding everything together everyone else around her offers brilliant support. Michael Cera as Juno's best friend (who happens to be her baby's father) is terrific. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney have some very witty moments and some very loving moments as Juno's parents who are rather understanding given the circumstances. As the prospective adoptive parents Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman do a great job in bringing to life two characters who have very different motivations, hopes and dreams. It's apparent as soon as we meet this couple that something may not be quite right and Garner and Bateman are pitch-perfect as the couple's story plays itself out.<br/><br/>So what we have is a simple but ultimately surprising and charming story. And that story is brought to life wonderfully by the cast who make it so easy to embrace these characters. As always seems to be the case in these teen movies music plays a key role and so many of the songs chosen here fit the film perfectly. It really is a very good movie. But is it truly as great as the hype would lead you to believe? Probably not. It's a movie which certainly has its flaws. The script may have won an Oscar but too often it seems Cody is trying way too hard to make her teenage characters sound cool or quirky. There's only so much ""cool"" teen dialogue one can take. Honest to blog. For her next script one hopes Cody will realize not every line has to be a potential catchphrase. Sometimes people, even ""cool"" teenagers, just need to talk like normal people. And again the story is not at all a deep one, in fact it's often rather mundane. With a lesser cast and director this movie could have been entirely unremarkable. It's the performers which inject life into this story and it is the performances more than the story itself which you will really cherish. If you go into it expecting the best movie of the year you almost can't help but be disappointed. But if you have realistic expectations you'll find that this is a rather enjoyable and charming movie. It's not the greatest movie you've ever seen. It's a nice little movie. And there's nothing wrong with that."
"jzappa","7","1","5","18 May 2008"," Cute. Period.
","What Juno is is a cute film. It's not great, it's not beautiful, it's not hilarious. It's cute. It's from the Wes Anderson/Jeffrey Blitz/Dayton-Faris school of film-making, an eccentric independent comedy made on a so-so budget that prefers the deadpan and understated way out. It puts to good use tangible social touches like the hamburger phone, the different expressive clothing styles of the teenage characters. But let us please stop giving Juno so much kudos. I simply do not understand this. 2007 is a year of almighty standard-setting American films. Why are we putting this one so high up on a pedestal? If American audiences are to praise a film of this effect, why has there hardly been any recognition congratulated to Blitz's Rocket Science, a funnier and much more insightful film within this said school of recent indie cinema?<br/><br/>At first Juno seems almost socially handicapped with the way the title character acts when first meeting two prospective adoptive parents for her unborn child, played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. It seems as if Juno intends to shock them with her opposition to verbal self- control or formality. It's not unclear as the story builds that she is unaware of what kind of person she is thus her approach to people is like a take-me-or-leave-me compensating attitude. The scene is not directed to par.<br/><br/>Overnight Hollywood success story Diablo Cody's script gives Ellen Page, a great young actress who gave an unreal performance in Hard Candy, a machine gun barrage of zingers, one-liners, and wry comical references to music and cinema that she turns out to be Woody Allen reincarnated as the hip, cocky, middle-America teenage non-Jew.<br/><br/>The ending also goes in the wrong direction for a film that we all are finding so touching. It does not leave me with the right spirit its ending should have. I will make it clear though that I do not want my resentment for this film's random accolades and popularity to distort my view of the film itself. I will close with my overall verdict on Juno, which is that it is a cute teen movie with just enough laughs, decent performances, and obscure references for me to have enjoyed myself."

","Juno is a sweet little guide to the teenage pregnancy. They say a child can not have child, you have to grow up first to have kids. This movie more or less backs this idea with the most rational approach possible, which creates a number of witty statements, tough decision making and a perfect resolution. <br/><br/>Pregnancy is the last thing you need when you are 16, but sometimes it happens and you have to deal with it. Juno is so practical and mature about it. She can't have a baby now, she is badly equipped as she says herself. She decides to carry that baby out, when the other option turns out not so appealing, but she will give it for adoption.<br/><br/>The way that 16 years old girl deals with the pregnancy is amazing, it is like it doesn't affect her life at all, she goes to school, she still meet her friends and even the father of the baby. Her parents are probably the most important characters in the movie, because their understanding and reasonable attitude towards the matter of question give Juno the freedom to do the right thing. Along the way she finds love, not where she was looking for it, but the true one, for herself and her baby.<br/><br/>I have to say that the characters are more real than the situation they are in, which makes them appear truthful.

At least in my school this feels like a everyday conversation. That is the lure of this movie- you feel like you can be in one of these rolls and the movie feels very realistic. This is the best movie i've seen since pans labyrinth. if you haven't seen this movie in 37 days from now it goes on video. Watch it. Well i guess thats it for my boysenberry scented review. Dream big everyone, dream big."
"nunemkh","10","1","5","8 March 2008"," So far the most realistic teen comedy i've ever seen, and the best.
","It really was the best, it was an awesome movie! The fact that some people didn't like it is just a coincidence. Juno is an up-lifting and hilarious movie. I left the theater feeling better than I have in a long time. The acting is surprisingly great. And the music is so wacky and fit for the movie - I listen to it every day now! I loved the cinematography also, since Juno gets pregnant and 9 months is long enough to go through all 4 seasons, i feel the director of photography really captured the seasons and colors very well. <br/><br/>And another thing. I think every good movie needs a lovable character, and every single character in this movie is incredibly lovable! This movie is a great addition to the sub genre of teen comedies and actually is like no other teen comedy you've ever seen. <br/><br/>Go out and watch Juno, then buy it! I know i will. Oh i couldn't Wright a review on Juno and mention my favorite quote from the movie- ""that ain't no etch-and-sketch, this is one doodle that can't be un-did home skillet"""
"danny5150","10","1","5","7 March 2008"," About the best out of FOX.
","I've done a lot of the post production work on this movie and have seen it front to back 20+ times and it still makes me laugh and leaves me with a good feeling every time. The characters portrayed by all the actors are flawless. The story and dialogue is something I have not seen in a long time, and I've worked on 20-25 features a week now for 5+ years. If Vin Diesel is your favorite actor, do not go see this movie. But if you are a fan of good cinema, intelligent scripts, and good acting you'll really like this film. FOX has been putting out some questionable films out lately, but this one gets back a little bit of its street cred back. For the entries i've seen dislicking this movie I have some advice. Stick with the movies you love most like ""The Fast And the furious"" or ""Speed 2"". Just because a movie isn't full of explosions and topless women doesn't make a film bad. So I guess because the Academy as of yet does not have the ""most bichin' movie ever"" category yet, on Oscar night you'll just have to watch reruns of Night Rider, or Battlestar Gallactica. Open your mind."

","I'm not much into ""chic"" flicks... and if it wasn't for my 18 year old daughter I wouldn't have gone to this one. That being said I was very pleasantly surprised. Great story, and not really predictable, great acting and video. Ellen Page playing the main character Juno, did a superb job as the ""troubled"" teen, very funny, sharp and real. A surprise was the step mother played by Allison Janney who really pulled off the but hard but supportive step mother. The cinematography was also first rate. Particular how the Juno morphs into a cartoon character in the opening/credits. Oh.. the music was first rate and the ending was feel good."

","I'm not sure this was the classic that it's been hailed in some quarters. I'm not sure it deserved an Oscar nod. In fact, I'm sure it didn't. But that's not to say that some of its hype wasn't deserved.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare instances where a film actually delivered on the word of mouth. Characters interacted in interesting ways. There were funny lines coming out of their mouths. The actors all did nice jobs with the parts. The film had something to say about teen pregnancy and, more important, life. <br/><br/>It wasn't groundbreaking. And I know teenagers don't talk like this in reality, but for the sake of this movie, who cares? Bottom line: it's a good time."
"basshol22","8","1","5","22 February 2008"," Academy Award for Original Screenplay?
","Does it bother anyone that Diablo Cody is winning an award for Best Original Screenplay, when in fact, it's a Korean remake from the film ""Jeni, Juno"" about the same exact subject. I thought the movie was great, don't get me wrong, but when it's not an original idea, than own up to it. Am I wrong here? I can see how it could seen as ""original"" because of the dialog and names but when an idea is very similar than you have to give credit where credit is due. Great example here is last year's best picture, ""The Departed."" This was a great movie, but not a very good screenplay. Watch it again and you may agree on where some holes are. That's beside the point. The point is that it's a remake even though he created the new English dialog. I could be nit picking here, but I don't think so. If something is not yours, you shouldn't claim it to be. Fess up here Diablo, that's all I'm asking."
"IamWilliamBlake","10","1","5","21 February 2008"," Perfect? Yes, perfect.
","A perfect movie, does not mean it is is the best ever, though I would not argue with if someone felt this way about Juno.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie worked for me. The story, the characters, the pacing, the camera-work, the direction, the production, the screenplay, the soundtrack... . How many categories are there?<br/><br/>I came away from Juno inspired, not simply because of the story, lesser films have been able to inspire. An idea or a simple act of kindness can accomplish just that. Juno offered a different kind of inspiration not often found in films. I am talking about the overall production. It reminds me of all the bands that say they started the day after watching the Ramones perform at the Roundhouse way back in the seventies. Juno is that kind of a movie. It will inspire, future directors, writers, producers, actors, editors, set designers, you get the picture. <br/><br/>It will very likely make you demand more from the films you spend your money to watch. I say this with a straight face, Juno is an important film. It is more than a family comedy melodrama teen angst slice of life with a hip soundtrack. It is what I expect to see when I go to the movies. Unpredictable, engaging, uncompromising, able to distance you from the reality of your surroundings, and above all, entertaining. Juno works on every level of movie-making. There is not one fatal flaw. <br/><br/>I am certain that some will disagree, some will point out something that they hated, didn't work, or they would have changed. That is the great thing about movies, you can always remake them yourself. <br/><br/>But for me, quite simply there is nothing I would change. Juno is perfect."
"Pinklady10","8","1","5","21 February 2008"," A lovable romantic comedy
","I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. There seemed to be a lot of fuss about it and thought I'd give it a go. During the first 30mins I was getting rather bored and annoyed as there was far to much music being played in the background, but I started to ignore it and really got into the story line. I thought it was going to be a bit like the film ""Fifteen and Pregnant"" which starred Kirsten Dunst, but it was nothing like it. Not only was this film enjoyable to watch, and sweet. It had some very funny lines in it. Ellen Page was wonderful as Juno and I'm surprised that I haven't seen her in many other films. I loved watching the romantic connection between Juno and her boyfriend in the film played by Michael Cera. They so obviously really liked each other but didn't want to admit it (I'm not giving away the ending) I like how different this film was, the way they showed how in love the young couple were. There are a lot of young girls getting pregnant these days and they end up keeping it which means they need to grow up quickly and don't get to be a child any more, it's very sad. In this film Juno knows she can't look after the child. She decides to go for an abortion thinking she'll get rid of it and not have to tell anyone about it, but she soon realises that its something she cannot go through with she comes to a decision to put the unborn child up for adoption. She finds a lovely couple Vanessa and Mark Loring, desperate for a baby who are almost to perfect although Vanessa seems more interested in having the baby than Mark. With Juno now faced with telling her father and step mother who would rather hear that she is on drugs or in trouble at school they too are shocked by the news but are eager to help with the adoption. With the pregnancy going well, Juno seems to be getting on really well with Vanessa and Mark Loring, but one afternoon while Juno spends time with Mark he tells her something she doesn't want to hear. After the baby is born, Juno and Paulie, her boyfriend both decide they don't want to see the baby and leave him for Vanessa to take home with her. The ending is adorable and made me cry. I loved it and would recommend it."
"tnrcooper","8","1","5","19 February 2008"," It's good...but a little too precious in places
","I feel a lot of people here, having read several pages of comments, are going a little over the top about the significance and hipness of this film. That is not to shortchange some excellent acting, most especially from the revelatory Ellen Page as the title character, from Jason Bateman as the possible adoptive father who is struggling with the never-ending male yearning to regress to age 17, Jennifer Garner giving a nuanced performance as a woman (Vanessa Loring) who really wants to be a mother but whose feelings may be driving her husband (Bateman, as Mark Loring) somewhat away from her. Garner has not received enough credit, in the rush to attribute credit for this film. She balances the most intense desire to be a mother but is having difficulty keeping the equilibrium which she has esablished with her husband. This is a tough line to straddle and Garner does it fantastically. I don't know if she has received an Oscar nomination but I don't think it would have been out-of-place for both she and Bateman, as Mr. Perpetually Arrested In Development (no pun intended) to have received them. JK Simmons offers a warm, rich performance as a supportive if somewhat baffled father (but then again, who isn't?) Juno's best friend Leah is also brought energetically to life as a somewhat hyper, smart, horny, smart-alecky teen by Olivia Thirlby. Michael Cera, I believe may have some difficulty extending his range if he does not soon do something in which he plays something other than the shy, reserved, sensitive male part. He is decent but his character's emotional palette is sometimes almost one note.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Diablo Cody has written a witty, whip-smart script, but at times it seemed a little too clever for its own good, attempting to out-""Fargo"" ""Fargo"" by dwelling on the specific upper-midwestern locale and the ""folksiness"" of all. This is not a major criticism, but it is a criticism. My primary beef is with Alison Janney's character who at one point when she and her husband were discussing Juno's just-revealed pregnancy said something along the lines of how do we rectify this sh*tpile of a situation. The dialogue just seemed at times to strain a little too much for our approval. That said, a scene in which Janney's Bren critiqued the x-ray technician for her unsolicited opinions on the frequency with which teens get pregnant was very funny and Cody has a fantastic ear for dialogue. I just found at times it seemed a little too precious. The film really would not be a quarter of what it was without such a wonderful script. <br/><br/>This is a good, funny movie, but as some other commenters have noted, in addition to some reservations about the preciousness of the dialogue, I don't think Cody recognizes the transcendent changes which ALL women, regardless of how hip, undergo, when pregnant. That said, I'd see this film about 42 times before I would see the vast majority of the dregs out there which currently pass for films."
"nickmat-2","8","1","5","16 February 2008"," A lovely film
","I really enjoyed this film it was down to earth, easy going, entertaining and had a lot of tension. The only problem is that the end was a little forced otherwise there was a lot of suspense in the air as well as an interesting exploration of human relationships.<br/><br/>Ellen Page deserved to get an Oscar nomination for leading actress, she played her role magnificently.<br/><br/>I would certainly recommend this film but then again it's a matter of personal taste, many people didn't like it because they evaluate films from different angles looking for different things in them.<br/><br/>--------------------------SPOILERS FOLLOW------------------------------- All was fine with the plot except towards the end when Paulie suddenly and unexpectedly felt and accepted his responsibilities towards Juno whereas up to that point he kept her at a very safe distance, emotionally. That was the only thing that felt unnaturally rushed in the film it was not at all a convincing transformation though it produced at least a happy ending."

","I think what is most stunning about this movie is not that it attempts to represent the new generation, or that it presents a new way of approaching adolescence. We don't have to take this film for something bigger than it really is; this movie has been made maybe not to think about it, but to enjoy it, to see how these fantastic characters fit so perfectly in a world that is definitely full of magic. Juno -the movie- is like García Marquez. However, here, the magic belongs to the simplicity of every part of the world created by Diablo Cody, to every character, to every action, to every place of this fascinating movie. Juno is simply that, an adorable story of love. Is that so hard to understand?"
"kevin_crighton","9","1","5","10 February 2008"," smart and intelligent comedy drama....
","When Juno finds herself pregnant, rather than have an abortion she decides to give it up for adoption, and after checking the ads in a local paper decides on a couple from the suburbs...<br/><br/>Juno is a movie that shouldn't really be so good. With it's premise - a teenage girl finding herself pregnant and deciding to give the baby up to a couple - this in other hands could have been a melodrama, a tragedy, or any manner of things. Instead, the screenwriter, Diablo Cody, has turned it into a smart, funny story.<br/><br/>Central to this is a stunning performance from Ellen Page as Juno. On screen for almost the entire movie she easily handles the weight upon her shoulders in carrying the movie. The rest of the cast, Micheal Cera, JK Simmons, Allison Jenney, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, and others are all very good too.<br/><br/>Some of the critics of the movie have said that it is too smart for it's own good. What's wrong with that?? No-one complains that Joss Whedon was writing smart funny dialogue in Buffy, for example. And here the dialogue IS smart and funny. The characters are well thought-out, and it's also clever in the way it plays with your expectations. Just when you think you know where it's going and how it'll end, it pulls off a couple of clever little touches that change your expectations.<br/><br/>The director Jason Reitman handles the mix of comedy and drama very well. The soundtrack is very impressive also, perhaps one of the best, recent soundtracks in a modern movie.<br/><br/>This is a movie that fully deserves the awards it's received, and it's Oscar nominations, especially for Ellen Page and Diablo Cody. As recent so-called teen movies (and I'm not sure it really is a teen movie) go, this is by far one of the best."
"mollymormonbrat","10","1","5","9 February 2008"," This is why we go to the movie theatre.
","I have already had the wonderful pleasure of having seen this movie twice. I cannot wait for it to come to DVD. My local movie critic considered this the best film of 2007 and I truly must agree with him. While it's not like we haven't seen the story of the pregnant teenage girl before, it's been awhile since we have seen it done with so much grace, humor, and heart and fantastic characters that earn your care.<br/><br/>From the beginning involving a chair to the ending involving another chair, ""Juno"" moves effortlessly along in a simple-yet-gorgeous way that lets you view Juno's life as she sees it. No, it's not hand-held camera, but it might as well have been the lovable Juno directing.<br/><br/>What really makes this show work is its wonderful cast of characters. Juno is the crowning star, but it is not like the others did not pull their weight. Jennifer Garner takes her sweetness from ""13 Going on 30"" and channels it into an adult yuppy. Jason Bateman is relatable, even when it's painful. Michael Cera pulls off a heartwarming performance. Allison Janney almost stole the movie. And it wasn't just stellar performances. These are wonderfully written characters, all fully realized and unique and proud to be so as they deal with this very serious situation of teenage pregnancy.<br/><br/>This movie deserves all ten stars and all the praise it has received. It is well-made. It is well-written. It is well-acted. It has a great message. It finally has a teenage girl stepping up to take responsibility, even in a society that frowns upon adoption. I went through every emotion, from tears-inducing laughter to tears-inducing heartbreak.<br/><br/>In the words of Mary Poppins, practically perfect in every way."

Great acting from all concerned and the subject material was moulded cleverly by a witty, odd but highly cute main character. Juno's personality didn't carry the movie but it certainly helped it flow and prevented and slow down in the story.<br/><br/>This is a chick flick, but my advise to any chaps being dragged along by their better halves - go with it, you might actually enjoy yourself, just keep it to yourself and don't tell any of the guys.."

","""Juno"" is one of the best movies I've seen in the past years. In it there is a lot different emotions and a lot of truth. The genre of the movie is something between comedy and drama and both are performed at really high level. The comedic sequences are great. I like that the movie can make you laugh in a intelligent way. I mean through the dialog between the characters, not like some stupid ""comedies"" where the cast is running naked on the street with no reason or something like that. I hate those ""comedies"". Fortunately in ""Juno"" every word and action has its meaning and even the ""dirty"" words don't sound cynical,just the contrary they fit perfect to the situation and help to describe the characters and their emotions.The drama sequences are also high class. The scene with Juno in the car when she cries, and the scene with Juno and Paulie in the hospital are beautiful. The cast and the acting are breathtaking. I am fascinated from Ellen Page, because she makes the character of Juno looks so real. I'll hold my fingers crossed for her at the Oscar ceremony. The Oscar nominees for Jason Reitman for directing and for Diablo Cody for original screenplay speaks for itself, so I just wanna say that this is one of the most natural and realistic movies I've ever seen. Finally I really like that the movie has positive message.It says that you should look for the good even when everything around you is really bad. And I'm sure that after the final scene you'll have BIG smile on your faces."

You can tell that the characters in the movie want to come across as cynical and cold, but they are all very caring and loving people. They are honest, upfront, candid, and amazing. My personal favorite is T.K Simmon's character, Mac McGuff. He is hilarious and warm, and a realistic father. Ellen page is an amazing actress and does a great job in role that I would consider to be VERY difficult. I personally believe that she WILL be a star very soon. The other actors in this film only help it. There is variety within the cast, there is humor, there is a whit, and a TON of realism. I have never known a family or group of friends like this, but something about the movie makes it feel so real. Garner, Bateman, and Janney are all very good in this movie. Watch it, PLEASE!"

"cultfilmfan","10","1","5","5 January 2008"," Juno
","Juno is about an eccentric 16 year old girl named Juno MacGuff who soon discovers that she is pregnant. Being 16 and pregnant isn't that easy as Juno soon finds out and during these nine months and right till the end of her pregnancy, Juno matures as a person and learns about life, love and a lot of other things most people at that age would not learn until much older. I realize that I 'am not going as lengthily into the plot of this film as I may have in some of my past reviews, but Juno is really a great film to experience and I feel that if I were to give away any more it wouldn't exactly be giving away any big secrets, or plot twists because the movie isn't like that, but I feel experiencing the movie without having too much knowledge or idea of how it might turn out will probably enhance your viewing pleasure because you get to see the magic of it's wonderful script and performances unfold before you and that is a far greater enjoyment than having known about the film's many quirks and wonderful characters that you may otherwise not be able to enjoy as much. The film's script is quite literally brilliant and one of the most original and heartfelt to come out of the Hollywood system in awhile. Everything from Juno's teenage urban vocabulary, the pop culture references, or just the film's wonderfully unique and charming characters that are really a treat to get to know throughout the film. While the plot of the film is simple enough there are so many different layers to all of these characters and their personalities and true self portraits get to shine during the film. And like I said because these characters are so original and at the same time so human and realistic it's authenticity is really felt. The script also features a lot of humour, great one liners and a lot of human situations that show us just how real this movie is and it is done with a real sharp taste of what it would be like for someone in this situation as well as showing the emotions, drama and life lessons including love that these characters discover. All of this is told to us with the brilliant spot on performances and the wonderful script that will make us laugh and other times warm our hearts with the loving and caring nature that the main characters show off. This past year we had Juno and Knocked Up both dealing with unplanned pregnancies and making it very humorous and at the same time very real and touching at the same moment. This film is so rich with it's writing and acted out with sheer brilliance by it's cast and it deserves a spot on the list as one of the year's best films and a wonderful performance by lead actress Ellen Page (who will likely get an Oscar if Julie Christie, or Marion Cotillard don't get it) and a real and wonderfully written script by Diablo Cody which just gets me thinking about how much I loved it by just thinking about it. This film works as a comedy, a drama, a character study and a human interest story with a lot to give it's viewers. One of the year's best."
"Craig_McPherson","10","1","5","5 January 2008"," It doesn't get much better than this
","Rarely has a movie so perfectly bridged the gap between teen comedy and adult drama and done so in such a fully-realized, mature manner as Juno, the story of a 16 year old girl from Minnesota who finds herself pregnant after her first night of sex with her soul mate.<br/><br/>Nova Scotia actress Ellen Page, who landed on my ""star of the future"" radar with her impressive performance in 2005's Hard Candy, continues to blaze her way to the pinnacle of Hollywood success with her turn as Juno MacGuff, a wisecracking teen who opts to carry her child to term and then hand it over for adoption to a well-to-do yuppie couple played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner.<br/><br/>Working from a terrific, clever as can be script by former stripper-turned-journalist Diablo Cody, Juno manages to tackle a sensitive subject, and the difficult choices that go with it, in a wonderfully mature and non-preachy fashion. Accolades are also due for the way it presents Juno's parents as decent, even-keel folks, and teens as intelligent individuals with greater depth and breadth than simple party animal morons.<br/><br/>Directed by Canadian Jason Reitman, the son of Ghostbusters Director Ivan Reitman, and smartly casting fellow Canuck Michael Cera (Superbad) in the role of newfound father and the cheese to her macaroni, as Juno describes him, this movie will not only make you laugh, but touch you with its compassion and tenderness without ever stooping to maudlin lows or resorting to clichés or stereotypes to tell its story.<br/><br/>This is quite possibly the very best film of 2007, and it wouldn't surprise me in the least if, come Academy Awards time, Juno walks off with a platter of Oscars. If so, they will be well deserved indeed."

Another aspect that deserves recognition was the incredible acting, just a perfect cast! Overall a very enjoyable film, Diablo Cody is getting the respect and compliments she deserves!

It was a gentle comedy with some great performances from all the cast, in particular J K Simmons, Allison Janney, but especially Michael Cera as Bleek. <br/><br/>So Juno wasn't a typical teenager - what is a *typical* teenager? I was into 40's and 50's music when I was in my teens, so for a girl to be into the 70's scene and classic horror films is not so unusual.<br/><br/>If you're reading the reviews to this film before watching it, don't be put off by all the negativity here - take it for what it is, a gentle, heart-warming comedy with some great performances."
"HybridCheeseMan","6","1","6","2 November 2008"," Not the Easiest Movie to Like
","Let's face it: Juno was a piece of indie-pop that was manipulative, forced, and different to the point of being completely in-genuine. Still, while this movie was far from the best movie of the year, I can't say that I wasn't entertained.<br/><br/>If you asked me about a year ago what I thought of this movie, I would have told you it was great and I would rank it up there with last year's 'There Will Be Blood' and 'No Country for Old Men.' There was a problem with that assessment, and it is the fact that both Anderson and The Coen Brothers were creating something that embarked on something much deeper and moving than the typical teenage reality show. In all honesty, 'Juno' could have been the answer to MTV's 'The Hills.' However, the operative phrase here is 'could have.' Meaning that it might have been had it been directed and acted in different hands. <br/><br/>In a nutshell, this is a film about a 16 year old girl named Juno McGuff (*facepalm) who is unexpectedly impregnated by her best friend Paulie Bleeker. (By the way, writer Diablo Cody clearly has a knack for plucking names out of the strangest corners of her mind. Could she have deliberately been writing this FOR an Oscar?) Juno must then face unspeakable hardships as she decides to bring the baby to full term, and put the baby up for adoption to Vanessa and Mark Loring, a couple of upstate yuppies who suppress a secret that is so obvious you want to shout Vanessa in case she may actually hear you. <br/><br/>There are two reasons why I enjoyed this film as much as I did before it started wearing off after subsequent viewings: they are Jason Reitman and Ellen Page. Reitman, for starters, has proved himself to be quite a director and satirist, and while Juno is FAR from any kind of dark humor or satire, 'Thank You for Smoking' was just that. Still, Reitman was able to bring a style to this film that took the 'cool' down a couple notches and turned up the 'normal,' almost as if he's saying to Diablo, 'I'm sorry, but these brats are just too annoying and self- centered.'<br/><br/>Cody's screenplay offered little empathy for Juno because she is such a smart-ass, a manipulator, and one of the most self-assured teens I have ever seen on a movie screen. This is where Ellen Page steps in and creates a dimension that I personally don't think Cody saw. Page was able to create a sub-conscious fact of Juno not being nearly as smart as she thinks she is, making Juno more grounded in reality than stuck in Cody's fantasy. Still, Cody got the Oscar, so what does that say?<br/><br/>Is the story touching? Hardly, and that is because of the fact that the story in it's entirety is bogged down by this new (and dreadful) hipster-speak. Hipster-speak, for the record, is not cool. It never was cool. It's fool-hearty, annoying, and it makes you want to smack the protagonist for being so damn ignorant and disrespectful. What also doesn't work is the fact that Juno's parents are hardly realistic. Other than the initial confrontation (Dude, just tell them) the parents had almost zero concern. They were loving and supporting, and that is a virtue in a family that is very, very real, but they were lacking in concern and control, which is very strange considering their child was impregnated. This is especially emphasized in the conversation after the initial confrontation.<br/><br/>Dad McGuff: Next time I see him, I'm gonna punch that Bleeker kid in the wiener. <br/><br/>Step-Mom McGuff: Mac, you know it wasn't his idea.<br/><br/>There is something to be said here about the amount of distrust and inaction this family has over their daughter. Sure, it could be real in a family, just like the name Liberty Bell McGuff could be real in suburban Minnesota, but it is hard to look at them and think 'what a wonderful, wholesome, and supportive family.' <br/><br/>The biggest downfall of this movie was how it condescends and manipulates the audience. Another movie that did this was 'One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest,' and it clearly took a side in whatever culture war was going on at the time. The difference here is in 1978, the war was between tradition, and kinking the system for a new state of mind. Here the 'war' is Hipster and everyone else who isn't hipster. There is legitimacy when there is viable context, but Juno really doesn't display any of that. <br/><br/>In short, 'Juno' was a movie that Diablo Cody written for her own self-gratification. It was her saying, 'look at how cool I am. I know all of these cool things and you can be cool too if you liked them also.' Sorry Diablo, but were not interested in being new age hipster clones. I think I'll stick with Jack Nicholson and watch 'Cookoo's Nest' one more time. Besides, I love the Chief more than I love Olivia. <br/><br/>Though I did like Jason Bateman."
"cwarne_uk","6","1","6","11 August 2008"," OK but lacks drama or bite
","How ""Juno"" became a cultural phenomenon is more interesting than the film itself. A mildly amusing and mildly dramatic film it miraculously made many critics lose their minds. The movies faults come down largely to the screenplay. To put it bluntly everybody speaks too much and too ""wittily"" (the ""wittily"" is attempted rather than achieved much of the time). Their is little rhythm to the dialogue. The film improves somewhat after a truly dire opening scene in a pharmacists where the banter between Juno and the always unfunny Rainn Wilson is embarrassing in the extreme. The opening exemplifies the faults of the film though - the script is simply not as clever as it thinks it is. What saves the film are the performances. Ellen Page is fine in the main role. JK Simmons and Allison Janney (both exceptional character actors) have little to do as over-nice parents but do it very well. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman though provide whatever emotional pull the film has, Bateman in particular got nowhere near the praise he deserved. Michael Cera turns in another of his patented George Michael performances - it's all very well but it is impossible to imagine him and Juno having sex which rather negates the point of the movie. A tepid indie soundtrack adds to the underwhelming niceness of the project. Like ""Knocked Up"" this is diverting enough, if you get through the opening you will likely enjoy it. The film does not stay in the mind though and it's main achievement is to make unwanted pregnancy ""nice""."

","""Juno"" represents one of the tragically few instances where big-budget Hollywood is forced to realize that they are no longer king of the film industry. This is an independent film through and through, and it's major, perhaps unexpected, box office success proves that something different does not always mean death for the movie.<br/><br/>Actually, it's success is quite surprising. ""Juno"" is a good film, but I've seen better. It's being marketed as a comedy, and while it certainly has it's moments of humor, it's actually more of a drama.<br/><br/>Juno MacGuff (a solid Ellen Page, who deservedly got an Oscar nod) is a very independent teenager who decides to ""go all the way"" with her best friend Paulie Bleeker (the terrifically lovable Michael Cera), and she winds up pregnant. After a bad experience at an abortion clinic, she decides to have the baby, and give it up for adoption, and finds a willing couple (Jennifer Garner, who's a little flat, and Jason Bateman, who is great, though even with his subtle character manipulation, he still seems similar to everything else he's played) in the classifieds.<br/><br/>Though the story focuses on Juno's pregnancy, at the same time it is also about Juno's coming of age (so to speak), and, more specifically, her romance with Paulie Bleeker. Kudos to Diablo Cody (who won an Oscar for her script), and director (who was nominated for a directing Oscar) for dealing with all of this in an intelligent and logical way. There's no superficial melodrama here, unlike some of the big-budget Hollywood productions that deal with teenage issues. Cody and Reitman know how teenage romance works, and they also know what it's like to be in love (""Casablanca"" this is not), and they develop this with a lot of tenderness and care, and it makes us really care about the people involved.<br/><br/>The film is marketed as a smart, razor-sharp comedy, but it's more of a light-hearted drama with a few laughs. The parents (the wonderful J.K. Simmons, whose performance arguably deserved an Oscar nod as well, and the slightly over-the-top and underdeveloped Allison Janney) are made to look like the greatest parents in the world since they are okay with Juno getting pregnant. Actually, it's slightly different. They're not happy about it, but they accept it and deal with the situation the best they can.<br/><br/>Knowing what you're going into is important in some movies, because if you expect something other than what you get, a person may have worse feelings than the film probably deserves (which is why I feel that marketing should depict what the movie is really like, instead of what will get most people into the theaters-it may not seem like it will get the most money, but chances are that the viewer will be happier with it and the film will get stronger word-of-mouth). This is what happened to me, so I was a little more easy-going on the grade (though I think that the 6 out of 10 is appropriate). It's still well-worth watching, and not as much of a downer as the subject matter usually has. Then again, it's not as fun as some would have you believe."
"tone_e2000","7","1","6","27 May 2008"," Overrated but enjoyable anyway
","Taking a different tone entirely to the other recent accidental pregnancy movie Knocked Up, Juno comes from the viewpoint of a 16-year-old girl. It's a comedy, but is played with the thoughtfulness that such a subject matter probably deserves. The cast is excellent, and the script is generally well-paced. Also, Rietman's direction is near faultless. <br/><br/>Sadly, the film is let down somewhat by possibly the most annoying protagonist in the history of cinema. Ellen Page is clearly a capable actress, but Juno is a ridiculous caricature of a world- weary teenager, full of pessimism and 'witty' one-liners, but with no particular redeeming qualities. Even by the end of the film, when you're supposed to sympathise with her, I still felt like she deserved a punch in the face. <br/><br/>Of course, if you can stomach this kind of character and the odd atrocious bit of dialogue, it's a decent movie with some great performances and an interesting soundtrack."

","Because of my deafness, I watched Juno with closed captions (like subtitles) to let deaf and hard of hearing viewers to understand and enjoy. I'm not able to comment on the music soundtrack nor the tone or meaning in the actors' voices. I, like other deaf individuals, depend on our next best available sense: sight. We rely on sight to get information, thus the underlying and intrinsic ""voice"" in my comments.<br/><br/>Granted that the storyline is not entirely original and, in varying degrees, simplistic, contrived and lacking taste in few spots such as an early scene on the toilet and removing the underwear (which I felt could have been left out), what I saw were subtle humor, honesty and Ellen Page's performance as the redeeming qualities. To be nominated for the best picture by Academy Awards is a stretch but to have had nominated Ellen Page in the acting category isn't at all.<br/><br/>Of all the 2007 Academy Award best actress nominees, I saw only Marion Cotillard's and Ellen's performances, thus unable to comment on other nominees. Though I very much feel that Marion herself thoroughly deserves her Best Actress Oscar award, I'd think Ellen as a worthy contender (probably along with Julie Christie)<br/><br/>Her performance reminds me of Pauline Kael's critique of Lillian Gish's performance in The Scarlet Letter (1926): ""...one of the most beautifully sustained performances in screen history - mercurial, delicate, passionate...it's as if no bones, no physical barriers, stood between her intuitive understanding of the role and her expression of it."" This is also how I feel about Ellen's performance. She would make Lillian Gish feel proud.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I feel the subject of teen pregnancies among young women of colors should have been presented in Hollywood movies. The options for black and Hispanic teen mothers are entirely different and they shouldn't be pigeonholed. that's my two cents"

","A High School girl, Juno (Page), gets pregnant and decides to give the baby to a childless couple.<br/><br/>This had the feel of The Wonder Years (TV) show. But, the narrator (Juno) becomes pregnant and that could have meant a lot of possibilities, but they never materialized and the writers took the safe road and not much was going to happen in here. It was a nice slice of life without the complications about a teenage girl who becomes pregnant that would have been conjured up. No tension, no parental battles, no input from the father (Cera) other than to say it was up to Juno to do what she thought best. There is a little hitch in the process, but it is quickly worked out. Oh, and BTW, The Wonder Years TV show had a lot of complications. Maybe the writers should have watched some episodes. <br/><br/>The acting was fine by the entire cast, but the writers had a lot of fun making a 16-year old girl produce dialog and wisdom that were beyond her years. Was this why this movie was nominated for Best Picture? <br/><br/>The little music diddies were good, but they were short lived and the one at the end of the movie was barely audible. There were some clever lines, but not LOL ones. <br/><br/>On the whole, this movie was nice, safe and really didn't have to be made, and really didn't have to be nominated for Best Picture either.

What was so special about his directing? Anyway.didn't win. And, lastly, the movie was nominated for Original Screenplay. Originality? A safe road, not often traveled and they want to give it an award? Didn't win.

When it's positive, she has to make decisions that will obviously have a bearing on how she lives the rest of her life. Michael Cera plays Paulie Bleeker, the baby's father. Allison Janney is great in the supporting role of Juno's stepmother. (Juno and her stepmother don't hate each other, but they don't exactly have a warm and cozy relationship either.) Jennifer Garner plays the impossibly elegant--and somewhat compulsive--Vanessa, who desperately wants a baby, but can't conceive. Jason Bateman is her husband. He's eager enough about adopting, but he's drawn to Juno in a definitely unhealthy way.<br/><br/>This isn't exactly a feel-good movie. It's not really a teen movie, a feminist movie, or an anti-feminist movie either. It floats close to all those genres, but doesn't fit any of them.

No blame from parents, too easy to find the adoptive couple-everything seem to easy for nonage pregnancy. In my point of view, the accidental pregnancy and the response from people is not the point of this movie. The pregnancy is something like the light in the dark or a guide, which lead you to see the world clearly and to find yourself. We all have gone through that special time in high school.

The father, Paulie Bleeker (Micheal Cera), is a nerdy track runner who just happened to be unlucky. Juno decides to adopt out the baby to a pleasant family seeing that her life isn't fit for a child to be raised in.<br/><br/>'Juno' is a story full of laughs and emotions. Juno is a character that you will never forget, with her witty sense of humor lining the entire movie. As she deals with the troubles of pregnancy, her family and friends support her with plenty of laughs along the way. There are few places in 'Juno' where you will find yourself bored of the movie, and when you walk out it may seem like Juno is walking out with you. There are a few slow parts in the movie, but it is normal full paced and cheery. In the mist of huge name action films, 'Juno' is a diamond in the ruff.<br/><br/>'Juno' is a film for everybody. It can relate to anyone from ages 1 to 99. If you are looking for a good, wholesome movie to go and see, 'Juno' is just the thing."

Written by a former stripper, Diablo Cody, Juno is nominated for this year's Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay.<br/><br/>Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) learned that she is pregnant after taking the pregnancy test thrice. She is only sixteen. Her boyfriend, Paulie (Michael Cera) did not know what to do after hearing the news. She considered abortion at first but then felt uncomfortable while inside the clinic. So she told her father and stepmother who took it in a casual way. Although they were expecting to hear her suspended from school rather than her pregnancy. Since she is not ready to be a mother, they searched for a couple who is willing to adopt her unborn child and found Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner). But it's more of Vanessa who wants it since Mark still prefers to watch gory films and collect comics instead of being ready to have a child.<br/><br/>Ellen Page shines throughout the film. She is undeniably the star of it. She portrayed Juno strongly in an endearing way. Her Oscar nomination is truly deserving. It is a pleasant surprise to see Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner like you've never seen them before. They are perfect for their roles. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney portrayed the supportive parents with humor and heart. Michael Cera is effective as the timid teenager who tries too hard to be cool.<br/><br/>The film delivers messages without being too preachy. It will touch your heart without trying too hard. It will keep you interested effortlessly. Almost every line is worth listening to and causes viewers to smile and chuckle often. Thanks to the witty script. The fun use of colors in the scenes gave the film a lively texture. Plus there is a great choice of music in the background. With all these elements combined, it is hard not to like this film.

Page has already won various awards for her performance and she will have another chance to get a major award when the Oscars come around in February.<br/><br/>Along with Ellen Page, writer Diablo Cody has won her fair share of awards. Cody brings a fresh presence to Hollywood with Juno, her first screenplay. Her humor, wit and dialog are unrivaled by anyone in Hollywood. From top to bottom Cody delivers a great screenplay for a great movie. <br/><br/>Sophomore director Jason Reitman (Thank You for Smoking) delivers an excellent movie with a great cast including Ellen Page (X-Men: The Last Stand), Michael Cera (Superbad), Jennifer Garner (Alias), Jason Bateman (Arrested Development), JK Simmons (Spider-man), and Allison Janney (Hairspray), with a hilarious cameo from Rainn Wilson (the Office). <br/><br/>Four stars, A+, 10-out-of-10, however it is said Juno is the best picture of the year."

""Juno"" is about a teen girl of the same name  think that's weird; her sister's name is Liberty Bell  played wonderfully by Ellen Page who gets pregnant from geeky boyfriend Michael Cera of ""Superbad"" and ""Arrested Development"" fame. At first she wants an abortion but quickly changes her mind and decides to give the child to a nice husband and wife, played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner, who can't have children, instead. <br/><br/>Ellen Page, who most likely won't win any major awards because of who she's up against, definitely carries the movie. She has acting chops that surpass that of the most seasoned professional. She carries out to perfection someone deeply confused and pregnant and all the while spouting off obnoxious remarks. Diablo Cody has crafted a sharp, weird and witty script worthy of an Oscar, and the cast delivers the dialogue with cutting precision. Michael Cera, once again playing awkward so well, and J.K. Simmons as Juno's loving yet strange father especially stand out. <br/><br/>There are so many good things to say about this sweet, heartwarming film. The opening sequence features Juno, half real life and half drawn, walking through a cartoon town drinking a jug of juice while crayon-drawn credits come on then get erased off with beautiful folk music playing in the background. That is what kind of movie this is. And oh the music, it was so good I downloaded it right after seeing it. ""Juno"" also raises some interesting questions and has some great life-lessons.

","To be honest I didn't really know what to expect with Juno. However my expectations that it would be worth watching were high and I have say that it certainly exceeded them. Ellen Page has made my top actors list and is certainly one of the most promising up and coming actors of today. I saw her in Hard Candy and a couple of her other films and her performance in Juno was no different in the way of impressing and intriguing me. She seems to have a natural knack for nailing punch lines and displaying a good sense of humor in general. Overall she is quite versatile (if anyone has ever seen her in Hard Candy, they'll know). As well, the other talents in that movie - J.T. Simmons, Allison Janney, Michael Cera, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner all equally contributed to the wittiness of the film. Though the movie did not have much character development, I still got a pretty good idea of who these people were because of the portrayal these actors presented. All in all despite the typically sensitive subject of teen pregnancy, Juno made it into a tongue in cheek premise that was enjoyable and easy to relate to simply for the fact that the characters could easily be someone who lives next door. I would pay to see this film again and will no doubt be investing in it when it is released on DVD."

"snare_ram88","8","1","6","3 January 2008"," Juno: A much needed breath of fresh air
","In a year of cinema that seems to be stagnant as it pertains to original and moving ideas, Juno is a breath of fresh air. It's a warm and emotionally intriguing film that explores the physical, emotional and naive struggles associated with finding maturity in our teenage prime. Surprisingly, ""Juno"" is an acting master class. Ellen Page is simply extraordinary, and Jason Bateman is just the same. Ellen and Jason's efforts are fluid and genuine--both create a sense of natural sincerity that I found to be exceptional. Jennifer Garner's effort is strong, as well as the rest of the supporting cast. Right now, Juno is the best acted film heading into the Oscars (with the exception of No Country for Old Men).<br/><br/>Diablo Cody's screenplay is nearly perfect, with the exception of ""quirky"" overkill at times. Cody's conception of Juno is quick witted (among other things), and she has obviously built her screenplay around this specific attribute. Unfortunately, this led to excessive use of sarcasm and quirkiness with her main character, but never enough to take away from the creativity of the script. Don't be surprised to see Cody's script duking it out with others like ""Charlie Wilson's War"" and Joel and Ethan Coen's ""No Country for Old Men"" for best screenplay at the Oscars. It's that good. Cody's effort is one of the best I've seen since Charlie Kaufman's brilliant work on ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" The quality of Cody's screenplay slightly resembles (but does not compare to) that of Kaufman: her screenplay is the ideal embodiment of genuine character development. Her characters are direct representations of real people facing real problems, and the script is used magnificently to convey that fact. In a world of cinema ripe with Hollywood fluff, Cody (like Kaufman) develops her character genuinely and compassionately.<br/><br/>As far as the story itself is concerned, it's a great one. The movie is grade A material through and through, but can not successfully avoid cinematic clichés. These clichés aren't necessarily bad...they're most likely unavoidable more than anything. ""Juno"" will have just as much success (if not more) than ""Little Miss Sunshine"" had with awards last year. This film will suffice as evidence that truly talented filmmakers are lurking under the radar. As I mentioned previously (and must mention again), Ellen Page is absolutely remarkable in this film. Never before have I seen a young actress possess such talent on the screen. ""Juno"" is truly one of the best films of the year."

","Juno is a wonderful movie filled with fine performances from the entire case.<br/><br/>Ellen Page is not only a gifted comedic actress, her subtle ability to show the teenager under the tough exterior was impressive and very touching.<br/><br/>Aside from the great humor, this movie has the added benefit of being unpredictable-keeping you guessing throughout the show.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed that always sharp Allison Janey in the role of the step mother.

Page easily delivers the best performance of the movie and just maybe the year. Fresh off from Superbad, Micheal Cera is also Oscar-worthy as Paulie Bleeker, the best friend to Juno, and is also the future dad of Juno Jr. Previous The Kingdom stars Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman play as the Lorings, the young, educated and some-what creepy couple that wants to adopt Juno's future baby, are also played very well.<br/><br/>I must only give this 8 out of 10 because of two major factors, despite phenomenal dialogue written by stripper to blogger to screenwriter Diablo Cody, I thought that she didn't write enough lines for Juno's dad, Mac MacGruff (brilliantly played by J.K. Simmons.) Also, I think this might have just have been me but Page and Bateman's relationship on screen just creeped me out."

Jason Bateman does not have big role but the little on screen time he does have, he definitely makes use of it. I loved his character the most.

Most of the funny jokes or original jokes in the film were in the trailer as well, so when I saw the film, they weren't as funny. <br/><br/>Maybe the marketing and film people should have taken a hint at the success of knocked up, where they had separate jokes for the trailer and separate jokes for the film.

You'd get a more convincing performance out of waving some blocks of wood in front of a camera. <br/><br/>Sights and Sounds - The cinematography is really boring. Everything looks as cheap as you can make live action. For some reason half the sets look like green screen. The visual quality itself isn't even that great. What little music there is is bland and forgettable. <br/><br/>Story - This story is really really boring. It may be unpredictable, but that's because its hard to tell what's going to happen because the plot is such a mess. Is the mom going to make a race joke? Oh, she did. Wasn't expecting that, but it was boring and offensive. Is the teacher going to be sexist? Didn't see that coming because its not funny or interesting so why was it there? Oh look, a whole subplot making fun of gay people. I'm offended, bored, and mildly surprised. This movie could've worked if it understand how shock humor was. Every joke (I'm assuming that they were supposed to be jokes as this is listed as a comedy) is designed to offend someone from most minorities to teachers to parents to teenagers to anyone with some level of basic intelligence. I got about 1/2 or 2/3 of the way through this morning (I got to the scene where the main character and the gay character are jumping on the bed pretending to have sex at a party while half the class listens through the window, excited that the MC is ""turning"" the gay kid) before stopping. I can't see anyone who didn't get offended at some point not just stopping because of how boring this movie is. I'm not exaggerating when every scene drags on and on. Most comedy doesn't work unless its fast paced. This movie is also listed as a drama, but the acting is too bad for there to actually be any drama.<br/><br/>Really I have nothing else to say except ""don't watch this movie."" It is so, so bad."

","I saw this film due to all the hype and I like Ellen Page in X-men, so I decided to give it a go. But this film is slow and boring, and annoys me how it portrays teens getting pregnant like it's no big deal: <br/><br/><ul><li>Juno is too fake: she takes her pregnancy too lightly. When she calls her friend, Juno says she is expecting a big reaction from her friend like it is some sort of a joke.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When her parents find out her pregnancy, her mother is like, 'I don't even know you are sexually active.' It shows how they really know or care about her and then even support her to give the their grandchild up to somebody else.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Juno doesn't care about the baby's future. When she talks to the adoptive parents, she goes, 'Can I just have the kid, then like hand it to you?' like it's some sort of gift and not a human being. When asked if she wants to know of any news how the baby's doing, she just shrugs off and doesn't want anything to do with it.</li></ul><br/><br/>I don't get how this could get a 7.9 rating. Also, the guitar music played by Juno's boyfriend is annoying as hell. Can Michael Cera act? No, plus he's damn ugly and geeky, unconvincing as the guy who fathers the child. When he knows Juno is pregnant, his only reaction is 'So, what are you going to do?', showing he's just as responsible as Juno."
"TheArgentWolf","7","1","7","28 November 2008"," Cute movie that I would definitely watch again
","Juno shows the strains and decisions that a pregnant teen has to make, from the mundane, to the more life-changing, and I think Ellen Page really does the role justice. The writing is amazing, every line being delivered by Juno is blunt and to-the-point, and often hilarious. The rest of the cast compliment her well, and I especially like the scenes of Juno spending time with the adopting parents. The character of Paulie was a little dull for my liking, but his scenes with Juno were well acted, and showed a good amount of awkwardness which made them funny.<br/><br/>All in all, I think it is a beautiful movie, and really gives you an insight in teen pregnancy."
"arustu","6","1","7","5 May 2008"," Not bad
","I personally think that this movie is quite good. The only thing that I didn't like about it was (though it was her choice and I respect that) the preachy pro-life stance and the misinformation presented to her. A fetus does not have hair or fingernails until pretty much the ninth month of pregnancy. Yes, she's pretty much doing the Gilmore Girls thing with the annoying fast talking, but other than that, she does, in fact, represent a rarity among teenagers. Trust me, being one, I know high school. Pick a random girl out among a high school and most likely she'll be a huge sunglasses-sporting, ugg-toting, Louis Vuitton/Juicy Couture bootleg-carrying, abercrombie/hollister wearing Paris Hilton wannabe with a fake valley girl accent that she copied from watching the OC or High School Musical. An intellectual alt-girl like Juno is one in a million. Yes, everything that you say is judged. Yes, when you say it is judged too. I like her attitude and I like the way this was presented. The production was great, and the writing was real. Plus, Diablo is just such a cool name!"

Yes, Ellen Page can act, and her role in the movie Hard Candy proves this, and her role as Juno was played perfectly as a quirky, smart, and sarcastic teenager, but basically this movie was a letdown and actually quite boring. Maybe because there was so much hype leading up to the movie. I did like the fact that the parents did not have a meltdown upon hearing that she was pregnant, and their little talk after she left the room was actually quite funny. The role of the hapless and clueless, but supporting, boyfriend worked, but only for so long. And what was it with Jennifer Garner's facial expressions? She looked like she had had 20 injections of botox and actually looked quite emaciated. Allison Janney is such a great actress, but her talents were wasted in this movie."
"hesdeadjim82","9","1","7","18 February 2008"," Better than I#d EXPECTED
","This is a really sensitive topic for a movie to undergo, and they do it with style. What was interesting was the way Juno was portrayed, she has some great comedy moments, quick whit and good morals. A misunderstood girl beyond her years, however, there are moments when her true age shows in her naivety. Especially when she lets herself get to close to people in situations beyond her understanding. This whole movie is like a rite of passage for Juno and she never losses sight of who she is. Michael Cera, I do enjoy watching. He rocked in Superbad, but he plays the same character (only less funny) in Juno. He is in danger of type casting himself. Although, despite this he was enjoyable to watch and added to the class of this movie."
"Robert_duder","7","1","7","23 January 2008"," Slightly over-hyped, decent but run of the mill dark comedy
","Juno is perfectly entertaining, decently made, there is nothing essentially wrong with Juno. The only issue is that there is nothing essentially outstanding about Juno either. People are raving about how different and dark and well performed and hilarious...and none of that is wrong per se except that it's not THAT different, dark or well performed. It's average. It's a decent comedy, not much more main stream than Knocked Up, Superbad or other comparable raunch comedies. Now Juno is the receiver of several Academy Award nominations including two big ones...best picture and best Actress and I'm just not sure that it is any more deserving than comedies we've seen that people would laugh off at the thought of receiving Academy nominations. But I am not trying to trash the film because it is entertaining and worth seeing and tackles teen pregnancy head on without taboo's or restrictions which is bringing it a certain amount of controversy and arguments. I don't believe the film is promoting teen pregnancy AT ALL or even poking fun of it or making light of it. Rather I think its saying that this happens...it has happened to this young girl and this is how she deals and copes. This is a reality, it does happen and at best a pregnant teenage girl might see this and think...this doesn't end my life...I have options.<br/><br/>Academy Award nominee (as of today) Ellen Page stars as the incomparable and unmatchable Juno. Page is electric and has amazing on screen charisma and really does make the film what it is. She has terrific comedic timing and her sarcasm is unmatched...Oscar worthy...not sure about that. The supporting cast is truly exactly that because the film is entirely about her. Michael Cera, coming off his Superbad success, is Juno's to good to be true, young naive love interest and father to her baby. Cera is perfect in the role and plays it well and they have good chemistry together although he doesn't have a huge role. Jennifer Garner is good but overly sweet in the role as the potential adoptive mother of Juno's baby. She does however relay the perfect mix of anticipation and fear. Jason Bateman plays Garner's husband and I don't know if he was good at it or not. If the goal was to come across as sleazy and creepy then he nailed it but every scene he was in you just expected something huge to come out about him and it never really happens. I'm not sure he was right for this part. Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons are absolutely terrific in their small roles as Juno's parents. They really do a great job, add some humor and some concern to the situation and they really steal their scenes together.<br/><br/>My girlfriend made a good point about this film. It felt like you kept waiting for this major climax, like everything was building to something but it never really comes. She gets pregnant, she weighs her options, she has it, she goes back to being a kid again...and that's about it. That makes for a decent story...sure...and it is funny and cute and Paige is terrific but it's NOT the movie of the year nor is it as outstanding as some seem to think it is. I believe that it's average plain and simple. It showcases some future potential talent and probably more adults find it amusing than teenagers or kids but I don't think it quite deserves the hype or nominations that it's receiving. Young director Jason Reitman just stumbled onto this and while he does a decent job telling the story I don't think he has the experience or extreme talent that everyone raves about. I don't want to deter anyone from seeing Juno because it is a lot of fun and you will enjoy it but don't expect the best film of the year by a long shot. 7.5/10<br/><br/>**************** NOTE <br/><br/>Yesterday on Tuesday January 22/2008 star of big screen hits Heath Ledger passed away in his home. I just want to wish his family, his daughter, and Michelle Williams and all his friends my deepest sympathy and I always believed he was destined to be a big star.

I was skeptical at first, never really been a fan of Jennifer Garner, never seen Superbad, and I only saw Ellen Page in ""Hard Candy"" so I wondered whether or not they could pull off over an hour and a half of dialogue.

Simmons, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner, and Rain Wilson. The script was awesome and these actors were great. There are two relative newcomers that are cutting their chops that did great, as well: Ellen Page and Michael Cera. The music is a nice touch, as well.

"mendez-joshua","10","1","7","20 January 2008"," Words Cannot Describe It
","From the studio that brought us Little Miss Sunshine comes the story of Juno, a slightly dramatic yet extremely funny comedy about life and the ""bumps"" along the way. Juno stars Ellen Page as Juno MacGuff, a regular teenager who gets pregnant after a wild night with her best friend. Juno explores the subject of teen pregnancy from top to bottom, and it never disappoints.<br/><br/>Juno gives us just what we want from a movie about teenage pregnancy: great characters, great music, and a brilliant cast. The writing of this movie is just perfect. The characters are so believable that it makes you wonder if this event actually took place. Michael Cera, Juno's best friend, is just perfect for the role of the caring lover. It makes you wonder if he is really good at acting or if he is the exact same kind of teenager he portrays.<br/><br/>Another thing that adds to the sheer greatness of this movie is its soundtrack. The music is wonderful from start to finish. The Cinematography of this film is worth mentioning. Although not outstanding, it was good from start to finish as well. The only thing that was bad about the movie was the way it was carried out. The intro was very typical of a Sundance Film, the music was very typical for a Sundance film, and the setting of it was also very typical for a Sundance film.<br/><br/>One of the things that jumps out when watching Juno is the type of pain many young mothers have to go through when they are pregnant. Not only must they withstand ridicule and mockery but go through the pain of carrying that child for nine months. The acting in these parts of the film bring out genuine feelings of pain and sadness that makes you think twice before you take part in any sexual activities.<br/><br/>If you enjoy humorous and realistic films, Juno is definitely the movie for you. It will draw you in and keep you enchanted until the very end. You will fall in love with the cast, and find yourself full of compassion for all the characters. From its superb music to its outstanding cast, Juno is flawless until the very end."

","Quirky, humorous although a bit touchy, dramatic, and a bit risqué with it subject matter this film walks a fine line between a being a distasteful teen comedy and smart comedy with a strong center of drama based around family and relationships. I will admit the beginning was a bit off humor wise, but stick through that rough patch and it will draw you in with an especially strong outing by young Miss Page. She is the core of the film without her slightly off beat sense of humor and strong will the film would probably fall off track. The surrounding cast is finely cast with Leah, Juno's friend being a bit more teenagerish than Juno, offering a funny sidekick and J. K. Simmons having a strong base as the rather rough around the edges father who ultimately cares about his daughter no matter what. Really the film did disappoint a bit from the hype, but that was to be expected. It had an off beat sense of humor which made for some great laughs and some strong drama moments making for a good balance, but nothing astounding. If there is anything to be loved about this it is Page's shining performance."

Michael Cera and Jason Bateman are incredible actors(see Arrested Development) so I figured I would enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>The cast is phenomenal, and I enjoyed J.K. Simmons in his role as the dad. Ellen Page did give a great performance, but she became sort of the cliché sarcastic teen that you would see on television.(There are a few scenes that stand out in particular which put her on the edge of annoying) This is my biggest gripe with the film, as the acting didn't seem real to me. It felt like I was watching a sitcom, which isn't bad, but it could have been better.<br/><br/>The acting in general was OK, and I'm a little disappointed with Michael Cera's character. First off, Cera was advertised as being a huge factor in this movie, which he isn't. I don't want to spoil the plot, but his character should have had more say in the movie as his importance was ignored in the overall story. It's clear that his popularity from Superbad would bring in many people if they stuck his face on every Juno poster.<br/><br/>In regards to the plot, there were some questionable motives and actions that didn't really develop all that well. It's very obvious to see what is going to happen next in regards to the story, but I thought that the writers would have approached it a little differently.<br/><br/>Overall I think that the movie was a unique surprise, but that's all.

"seaview1","9","1","8","21 January 2008"," Juno's Touching, Growing Pains
","An interesting phenomenon is happening slowly in Hollywood. The offspring of some of the movie industry's best directors have begun to assert themselves with their own, distinct voices. Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), whose father is Francis Coppola of The Godfather fame, Nick Cassavetes (The Notebook) whose father John Cassavetes pioneered independent films, and now Jason Reitman whose father is Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters fame, have all proved that talent can be in the genes. Reitman has perfectly realized his vision of a coming-of-age drama, Juno, based on a fabulous script by newbie, Diablo Cody. This small, original film has enough intelligence and creative film-making to stand among bigger budgeted studio releases as among the best of 2007.<br/><br/>Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is a sixteen year old high schooler whose planned sexual encounter results in an unplanned pregnancy that causes a sensation among her classmates and at home with her dad and step mom. A smart, sassy-mouthed loner, Juno, after deliberating on whether or not to abort the unborn, takes matters in her own hands and decides to donate her baby to an adopting, yuppie couple, Mark and Vanessa. Life is not so easy as situations change suddenly, and the dynamics of Mark and Vanessa throw everything into a tailspin as Juno's life becomes much more complicated. Wondering if couples can ever really stay together and if true love can exist, Juno makes some hard, mature choices in her life.<br/><br/>The movie is presented in a unique format with actual, script lines subtitling the bottom of every shot. It's almost as if the DVD extras are being used on screen. This device, while interesting, can be a bit annoying too. A series of ballads punctuate and underscore the narrative much like Cat Stevens did in Harold and Maude. It does enhance the story and mood. The structure of the narrative is sectioned by the seasons beginning with autumn.<br/><br/>High school life is portrayed in a convincing manner with the behaviors and interplay dead on target. Some individual scenes like Juno's parents first hearing and fearing what big announcement Juno has in store for them, or the confrontation with the ultrasound technician are pretty amusing. And there are quiet, introspective moments like between Juno and her dad or with her 'boyfriend' Bleeker that are quite touching.<br/><br/>Ellen Page already made her mark with the recent Hard Candy and showed her versatility in X Men-The Last Stand, but to exhibit that rare combination of drama and humor in a believable manner is quite a feat. There is not one false note in her impressive performance. You begin to place yourself in her position and empathize through her joy and pain. The rest of the cast is strong, and each has good portions of dialogue to capitalize upon. J .K. Simmons is quickly becoming a go-to character actor as Juno's dad, and you wish Allison Janney had a bit juicier part to fly with as the step mom. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are quite good as the prospective, adoptive parents. Michael Cera (Superbad) and Olivia Thirlby make convincing schoolmates.<br/><br/>We discover with Juno that life can be full of unexpected surprises and twists, and it is how we deal with those events that can have a profound and lasting effect on one's future and happiness. (I can't wait for writer Cody's next story.) When you think about it, the screenplay rings true throughout without being preachy or awkward; it just sounds like it could really happen. That's what makes Juno a terrific slice of life tale, a deceptively simple story with a rich core of acting and words. Oscars love this kind of independent jewel."

During the first few scenes you don't know where the movie's going and you think that laughing at a teens pregnancy is not politically correct, but pretty soon the comedy rips everyone open and the crowd in the theater lets loose. Rarely I'm in a theatric where 100 people are all laughing at once. You'll have to sit through some emotionally drippy chick-flick scenes but, comedy alone won't bring my wife to the theater so it was worth it.

What you are convinced of is, this young woman shouldn't be experimenting with motherhood. She's way too naive and inexperienced. That's not exactly a hard sell, though. So why should we take an evening to delve into this cliché? I guess the answer is so that we can marvel at this young woman's apparent inner resources and irrepressible good humor. The wallowing is a little too unrewarding for me.<br/><br/>I admit, thinking about it afterward, it is nice to see some of the characters found in this film displayed totally unadorned and unromanticized, but that's not exactly 'entertaining' without some insight or revelation to go with it.

Witty one-liners often involving Ebonics, such as ""fo shizz"", make Juno, played by 15 year-old Ellen Page, the coolest teenage character in film since Natalie Portman's portrayal as Sam in Garden State--a similar trendy Indie released a few years ago.<br/><br/>Juno is currently being praised as ""the best comedy of the year"", and it certainly lives up to the title. It's almost impossible to keep up with the hilarious dialogue that rolls off each character's tongue. Directed by Jason Reitman, who brought us Thank You for Smoking and written by newbie Diablo Cody, Juno succeeds as a comedy, but falls short when it comes to being an overall great film. Reitman and Cody deserve an A for effort, but there are a couple of plot holes, as well as some dialogue that, at times, feels as if it is being forced down viewers' throats-- attempting to prove how hip the characters actually are.<br/><br/>The mainstream-Indie, which resembles last years ""little Indie that could"" Little Miss Sunshine, is also clearly influenced from the lesser-known 2001 film, Ghost World. Juno MacGuff isn't a sugar-coated cheerleader character, but instead, like Sam in Garden State, she is considered ""cool"" and ""different"" because of her strong taste in unpopular music and her nonchalant attitude towards the world. Perhaps it is a good thing that the stereotypical cheerleader characters are being replaced by smart, interesting girls with good taste in rock and roll. On the other hand, these new ""Indie"" girls are becoming the new stereotype. Isn't it possible, in the real world, for there to be a girl who can be a cheerleader but also listen to the Pixies? According to these films, it is not.<br/><br/>Juno's family is led by her supportive father, Mac, played by JK Simmons and her dog-obsessed step-mother Bren, played hilariously by West Wing alum, Alison Janney. Her best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) is a funny sidekick, but unfortunately, it is hard to focus on the talent that Thirlby has because Page is constantly stealing the show from anyone who she comes in contact with. The very last branch that makes up Juno's family tree is her almost-boyfriend Paulie Bleeker, a.k.a., the dude who knocked her up. He is portrayed by Superbad's Micahel Cera, and he is awkwardly funny as ever. To quote Juno (talking to Paulie Bleeker), ""you're, like, the coolest person I've ever met, and you don't even have to try."" Cera makes looking cool so incredibly simple. It's a shame there isn't a handbook one can read in order to emulate his every move.<br/><br/>Besides her eccentric family, who are similar to the cast in Little Miss Sunshine, there are the Lorings, played by Garner and Bateman. Garner's character, Vanessa, wants nothing more than a child. She feels she was born to be a mother. Bateman's character Mark, on the other hand, isn't quite as thrilled. He is an ex-rocker who still dreams of his past freedom on the stage. Because of his strong taste in music, he and Juno bond. However, this bond is the main reason the movie falls short. Juno and Mark's relationship makes for a confusing/awkward subplot that tears away from the overall simplicity of the film.<br/><br/>If it weren't for the exquisite dialogue and the chemistry between the actors, let alone, the actors' phenomenal performances, Juno wouldn't have been praised as ""the best comedy of the year"". As two young, relatively new-to-the-scene actors, Page and Cera bounce off of each other in such a natural way, and they truly make their characters come alive. Their relationship is young and fresh and, if you aren't busy ""awwing"" during the last scene of the film, I can promise that you will at least have a large grin on your face."
"prettymuse789","8","1","8","9 January 2008"," Great Change of Pace
","After the breathless blockbuster race of 2007, seeing films that realize the emotional (as opposed to visual) appeal of the art is rather nice. Juno will show moviegoers that awesome special effects are not the only qualities that can make a movie a hit.<br/><br/>With great, captivating performances by the entire cast, Juno spotlights the subtle, small moments of life that are often overlooked. The unique quirkiness of Juno especially makes the movie worth watching. Page is a combination of eccentric, rebellious, romantic, and cocky; the result of such a mixture is a compelling character, the likes of which haven't been portrayed so convincingly since the John Hughes films of the '80s (Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller, etc.).<br/><br/>But Juno's take on her predicament--her unplanned pregnancy with a quiet schoolmate named Bleeker--does become slightly irritating. In the scene where she meets her adoptive parents (Garner and Bateman) for the first time, the focus eventually shifts from her to Garner's character because the protagonist's insensitivity toward the situation is almost repulsive. You almost want to slap Juno for her immaturity toward a situation with such gravity, a contrast to the film's delicate and sympathetic treatment of her pregnancy.<br/><br/>But Juno's eventual maturity is redemption for her initial arrogance. Page gives a multifaceted, heartfelt depiction of a teenage mother, and the impact of her decision on the rest of the Juno universe is made believable by the great performances of the rest of the cast. The subtlety of JK Simmons and Bateman's acting is something to marvel at considering the types of characters they usually play.<br/><br/>The script is excellent. The writing really captures the point of view from the adults and children equally and with authenticity. It's hard to fully support or oppose Juno's decision because you also become attached to the rest of the multifaceted characters. The screenwriter's ability to develop fully fledged, realistic individuals in an hour and a half should not be ignored.<br/><br/>The folksy quaintness of the score, mellow colors of the cinematography, and great humor of immaculate editing all contribute to the movie's polite quirkiness. The director's refusal to ignore the minor realistic and cinematic elements of Juno creates an engaging, compelling, heartwarming story that will be a great way to begin the movie-going journey of 2008."

","This movie was not technically a ""chick flick"" but sure acted like one for most of the movie, but it was surprisingly welcoming. The movie was very funny, the dialogue was fast and quirky, and Ellen Page was awesome. The role almost seemed to be made for her. J.K. Simmons as the dad also was hilarious, and brought most of the funniest lines and actions of the movie. Micheal Cera was also pretty good, with not too many lines but some funny facial expressions and actions, much like he did in ""Superbad"".

Juno gives out hilarious comments and thoughts, very funny. The conflict plays out excellentley and the end is surprising and touching. Love it. I especially loved Juno's rebellious attitude and personality. Ellen Page did an AMAZING job playing this role. Over-all all I have to say is that it is briilliant. (Sorry that i repeat myself, but I just am absolutely in Love with this film).

","I recently saw Juno with my two good friends. I had been awaiting the release of Juno since much earlier this year. With all the anticipation, I was sure that Juno would not live up to my expectations. I was sorely mistaken. The film was utterly fantastic. The quirky language was remarkable. It was a very real portrayal of a sixteen year-old girl who gets impregnated by her close friend. The end. No stylized crap or PSA-like tales to make it seem like a film to warn girls against protected sex and other acts. It tells her story like it should be told. Juno does the right thing and lives her life as good as she can in the predicament she is in. This is my kind of movie.<br/><br/>Also to be mentioned are the great performances showcased. Ellen Page certainly deserves her numerous award nominations. However, I also believe Jason Bateman's performance was great. A man longing for his younger rock-n-roll years. He should be awarded with a Supporting Actor nomination too, but that's just me. <br/><br/>All in all, this was a great way to get away from the blockbuster-y type movies I was bombarded with during the summer. A nice change of pace."
"taylorcrane10","10","1","8","2 January 2008"," Wonderful!
","Juno was a really great movie. No doubt about it, however I get tired of hearing that it puts teen pregnancy in a 'positive light.' Here's what I believe, this movie is NOT about teen pregnancy, it's about overcoming adversary. Overcoming strive. Sure, teen pregnancy is apart of it but not all of it. And I don't feel like it was just a simple way out to give her baby up for adoption. After she gives birth she's crying because it's not an easy choice. It's a selfless choice. That in itself should be praised. Juno may not be the best movie of the year compared to movies like No country for old men, but at least you walk away from it feeling like it is a 'feel good' way to spend your time."
"jcorn59483","10","1","8","30 December 2007"," Moving quickly up the charts, deservedly so!
","I hadn't heard a thing about this one before seeing it so it was a total surprise and a delight. Jason Bateman was the main focus of my surprise as I had never really seen him in major roles that I truly enjoyed (but I'm open to suggestions, not saying he hasn't done any).<br/><br/>We took a 16 year old male to see it with us and I can state that it held his interest as well not just that of the much older adults in tow. Ellen Page was also very strong in the film and...at this point I'm debating about how much to give away. The film deals with issues of sexuality, teen angst and other topics but if I describe too much about the actual plot I'm afraid I'll spoil the film for someone.<br/><br/>I note this because I think I enjoyed it even more for not knowing much about it beforehand. I would urge you to look at the way it has moved up the popularity charts, quickly, and then take a chance on this one. If you need more urging then you might be compelled to go by the fact that Jennifer Garner is also in the film, an actress who I find generally compelling.<br/><br/>If I had to sum up the plot of this I'd note that it has a strong female lead, even a heroine - and that's as far as I'm going with any details."
"bitsandbytes56","9","1","8","30 December 2007"," Great Script carries the movie
","I thought the dialog in Juno was perfect, unlike others critical that it was over-the-top (of course it was!). It was quirky and witty. It is the dialog that makes Juno work and keeps us hanging on. There is no real suspense or action gimmicks in this movie, only the characters and their very real lives and foibles.<br/><br/>I think all good character-driven movies have this quality of fast paced and intriguing discourse, a condensation of how people talk to each other, a ""top hits"" of one-liners. If it were the bland pablum of most real-life conversations, it would not hold our attention for 90 minutes. The kind of wit in this script may occupy less than 5% of most conversations, but we would not wait for it in a movie. It is the voyeuristic observation of these unique people's lives that keeps us at the character's window.<br/><br/>This movie had been compared to ""Little Miss Sunshine"" by friends. I did not see the similarities, other than the pre-adult female central character. Although well-written, LMS is completely over-the-top and offbeat, more like a cartoon from Mad Magazine, than a real life drama. Juno is plausible.<br/><br/>I applaud Diablo (Brook Busey) for her excellent writing. From reading a mini-bio on this site, I think she is probably as quirky and refreshing as her character, Juno. The fact that she was a stripper, is a former ad-writer (to which references were likely made with the Jason Bateman character in her movie) and married to someone she met on an internet romance is perfect and fodder for many more great scripts. I am sure Diablo shares a lot of the qualities of Juno, including the quick wit. I am sure she twists quips and colloquialisms in ironic and funny ways in her real life, too. Although, maybe not with the frequency of Juno (no one is THAT clever).<br/><br/>My primary criticism of this movie: I wonder if Diablo knew her script that was set in her (now) home state of Minnesota would be filmed in Vancouver, BC. Anyone from Minnesota saw immediately all the inconsistencies, from mountains in the backgrounds, to rhododendrons in landscapes to the cherry blossoms on trees (in the fall????) and the douglas firs to the huge houses in an expensive neighborhood in St. Cloud???? Didn't quite work for me. They should have just shot the movie in Minnesota. After all, the loonie is worth more than the US dollar these days! In any case, I am looking forward to more work from Diablo Cody and plan to read her book."
"TigerLordII","9","1","8","29 December 2007"," A down to Earth refreshing and wonderfully acted movie
","Juno follows the steps of Knocked Up, but then takes the higher road and goes at great length to touch us, mainly because, you will identify with at least one of the character for sure. Worthy of mention is beautiful Ellen Page's performance, who is the most deserving for this year's Oscar as best leading actress in a comedy. She sticks with her character Juno wonderfully - she has truly grown in a fantastic actress since Hard Candy.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is equally good: Janney and Simmons are hilarious and play so spontaneously that you could forget it is a movie. Although some of the teen babbling and slurring might have annoyed some, it is only a true reflection of our everyday neighborhood and for this reason alone does it succeed so well at captivating us. The audience was hypnotized by Juno's charm.<br/><br/>Juno is a masterpiece - soundtrack, writing and acting all work in harmony to deliver one of 2007's best movie. You will probably laugh, you might cry, but you will surely love it no matter what."

","I probably should not be posting in the comments, seeing as how I've not yet seen the film. But I was hoping somebody that has could offer some insight.<br/><br/>In respect to the situational circumstances that this film highlights, (teenage pregnancy, unwed pregnancy, adoption...) is the writing over-the-top in stereotyping or adding negative connotation? Or in other words, is this a film that a an Adoptee, Adoptive Parent or Birth Parent could watch and appreciate without feeling overwhelmed by society's typical inability to portray these delicate issues with tact and fully acquired perspective? I appreciate films for their creativity and edge, but I have not yet found a film that not only creatively depicts the mentioned situations, but also accurately depicts them.<br/><br/>I do not hope to open a battlefield forum, I am just hoping to pick the brains of those that might offer some helpful insight.

"meeza","10","1","9","28 January 2008"," This Juno is not cold!
","The quirky revolutionary comedy ""Juno"" has impregnated the birth of the verbose juggernaut of our present youthful society in cinematic screens. Writer Diablo Cody's innovative screenplay is a call to present to us how many of our teenagers and young adults dingo the lingo. Before I let more of the Diablo inside of me and marvel on the wonder of Cody's screenplay, let me inform you the embryonic state of the ""Juno"" plot. The articulate Ellen Page plays Juno MacGuff, a high school teenager who gets pregnant and wishes to give the baby up to child-seeking parents who are wealthy & mature enough to care for the offspring. Juno is a prototypical cerebral 2007 teenager, who even though she speaks a modern & idiosyncratic lingo and demonstrates a mature demeanor, she still possesses the archetypal egocentric characteristics of a high school teenager. Juno was given the ""stickin to the cliting"" by her introverted best friend Paulie Bleeker. Paulie is in his high school's track team but he does not run away from Juno's oven ordeal. Leah is Juno's best friend and I will be ""leahying"" if I said she did not act like your typical Americana teenager. Mac MacGuff is Juno's understanding & supporting pop who does hold some reservation on ""le pregno situation"" but still stands by Juno in her baby steps decisions. Bren is Juno's stepmother who is open to the times so she also lends a helping hand. Mark & Vanessa Loring are the yuppie couple who made the Juno cut and will parent the Mini-Juno once it makes it earthly debut. These are the zany but charismatic characters of ""Juno"" and thank God they entered our cinematic existence. The ensemble acting of ""Juno"" was uno for the thespian ages. Ellen Page's performance as the title character was the best I have seen this year by a female actress. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney's work as Mac & Bren was an acting planned parenthood that delivered. Jason Bateman & Jennifer Garner adopted some positive acting points in my book portraying Mark & Vanessa Loring. I especially thought that Bateman was phenomenal and there was some ""arrested development"" going on when he did not make the cut of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominations. What can I say but ""Que Cera, Que Cera"" for upcoming young actor Michael Cera's ""unbleaky"" performance as Paulie Bleeker. Olivia Thirlby also thrilled me with her work as Juno's BFF Leah. I guess after all hipster Director Jason Reitman was the right modern man for the job to deliver the birth of ""Juno"". I am glad the film's producers made the right house calls in selecting Reitman as the film's auteur. But I must return to hell and feed you more Diablo; because Cody's ingenious screenplay was the lump that made ""Juno"" grow into one wondrous comedic doodle that can't be undone. So take a bite out of your time by visiting Juno MacGuff and company. ""Juno"" what I mean! ***** Excellent"

Allison Janney who plays Juno's step-mother is really funny at the oddest times. J.K Simmons, I just love this man he's played just about every kind of character there is. Jennifer Garner I am a huge fan of her's she did amazing in her role of Sydney Bristow in Alias.

","This move was extremely cute! I went in with high expectations, and came out enlightened. Juno, a bright quirky sixteen year old girl becomes pregnant with her best friend's baby, quickly decides against an abortion (thanks to a hint that babies have fingernails) and goes the adoption route. Through the Pennysaver, she finds Vanessa & Mark, a couple who had been struggling to conceive and was now willing to adopt a child. The movie tells the process of pregnancy through Juno's eyes, with all her little sarcastic comments and whatnot, and her issues and problems along the way. I personally loved the ""straight out of the art studio"" feel of the movie. It didn't feel quite so scripted, but more like it was just real life on the big screen.<br/><br/>My favourite part was the ending, where Bleeker and Juno sing the Moldy Peaches song ""Anyone Else But You"". Amazingly cute and stunning, she gets up and gives him a kiss.<br/><br/>This movie is so reminiscent of highschool.

"marissas75","9","1","9","20 January 2008"," Gets deeper and wiser as it goes, just like Juno herself
","Movies named after their main character usually work best if that character has an outsize, iconic quality--and Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) certainly qualifies. A smart-mouthed 16-year-old who becomes pregnant by her friend-with-benefits Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), she is the star of one of the year's best comedy films.<br/><br/>The movie is divided into three sections to correspond with the three trimesters of Juno's pregnancy, as well as the conventional three-act screenplay structure. The first part gets off to a rough start because the dialogue is over-written, too clever by half. Some of this is necessary to characterize Juno as a snarky alterna-teen, but why should a random pharmacist talk this way as well? Also, the filmmakers don't convincingly explain why the self-confident Juno chickens out of getting an abortion.<br/><br/>Things get better with the introduction of Mark and Vanessa (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), the yuppie couple who want to adopt Juno's baby. Their dialogue is ""normal,"" not overly hip, and their arrival really sets the plot in motion. The relationships between Mark, Vanessa, and Juno become interestingly complex, and their characters deepen--we learn that our first impressions of them do not tell the whole story.<br/><br/>Indeed, although the first part of the movie seems to idealize everything about Juno (her wit, her taste in music, her hamburger phone), it eventually allows her to be unlikable at times. Her flippant jokes do not impress Mark and Vanessa, and she behaves thoughtlessly toward sweet Paulie. When she apologizes to him in front of his cross-country teammates, it's a nice reversal of all those teen movies where the guy publicly apologizes to the girl.<br/><br/>So by the end, what seemed like it was going to be 90 minutes of shallow pop-culture allusions becomes a warmhearted comedy about a teenage girl learning that she still has a lot to learn. Though Juno's dialogue is still sardonic and clever, it no longer feels artificial. At her lowest point, she quips ""I've been out dealing with things way beyond my maturity level""--a funny line, but one that shows her vulnerability and fear of growing up too fast.<br/><br/>At least, that's what I got from Ellen Page's reading of that line, and it feels spot-on, like all of her work in this film. Michael Cera assists with his trademark awkward-but-trying-not-to-show-it attitude, and together Page and Cera provide an adorable final scene. Bateman and Garner handle their character development well, and J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney play Juno's sympathetic parents. And I am especially looking forward to writer Diablo Cody's next project--I hope she got her excesses out of her system with the first part of ""Juno,"" because the rest of the movie proves that she can write a charming comedy."

Those who don't enjoy the movie just have a low IQ and don't understand the jokes. I really wish the world contained more people with a good sense of humor instead of the normal idiot humor that most of the people who hated this movie have.

","I'm surprised at the vehemence of the people who dislike this movie for not making a Serious Statement about teenage pregnancy and/or abortion. Underneath the hipper than thou dialog, Juno is basically the kind of sentimental fable about decent, likable people that Frank Capra would be making if he were in his prime today. It has about as much to do with the actual consequences of pregnancy for a working class teenager as You Can't Take It With You did with unemployment during the Depression, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington with the rules of the Senate, or It's A Wonderful Life with the savings and loan business in a small town. That's pretty good company, and Juno belongs there."
"SteakSalad_101","7","1","10","21 January 2008"," A cute film that's enjoyable for everyone
","I have never been the only male person in a theater audience before. Ever. But now as I have gone to see ""Juno,"" I know what that feels like. From all the hype surrounding this movie, and Roger Ebert himself calling it the best movie of the year, I decided it would be worth walking down to my theater in below 20 degree weather to see it at a 2:45 matinée on a lazy Sunday afternoon. So I did.<br/><br/>First and foremost--the film is over-hyped, but I still loved it. Juno (Ellen Page) is a weird, abnormal, yet stunningly cute teenager who messes up and gets pregnant by her best friend Paulie (Michael Cera). After choosing not to abort the baby, she decides to find adoptive parents, but in turn must face being pregnant at school, at home with her parents, and of course, trying to balance the everyday challenges of teenage life. As expected, there are bumps along the way, and that's why I think Juno is not so much a movie about teen pregnancy and the dangers that come with it--but as a dramedy about growing up.<br/><br/>There are a lot of original, fun, quirky ideas that come along with Juno--one, primarily, is Juno's character, who you can't help but love. She's weird and rebel, and doesn't try to be popular, yet of course, she gets some unwanted popularity eventually. Ellen Page does such a seamless job portraying the character, I would not be surprised if she was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Then we have Juno's best friend Paulie (who gets her pregnant), who is the nerdy, skinny kid who dominates the track team, plays guitar, and puts deodorant on his legs. The adoptive parents--Vanessa, the baby-obsessed lady who wants a child so bad she's ready to jump off a building, and Mark, the musically obsessed Sonic Youth lover who forms a friendship with Juno. I could go on and on and on but you get the picture...the film is quirky and lovable by everyone.<br/><br/>The film has a very indie feel to it that is paired up with a cute, indie acoustic soundtrack that I absolutely loved. The acting is without question some of the best I've seen in 2007 films--the dialogue is very witty, quirky, and entertaining, and forces a smile upon your face. Ellen Page gives a phenomenal performance as the weird, pregnant Juno and she is paired with outstanding performances by Jason Bateman, who you might remember from Arrested Development, and Michael Cera. Unfortunately, though I really liked the film, it is extremely over-hyped. It does not deserve a Best Picture nomination and certainly not it's 8.4/10 rating on IMDb. The strongest point of Juno is its indie -feel and originality--the weakest, unfortunately, is the way it is executed. I can't help but think Jason Reitman, the director, sort of mishandled the film and couldn't decide on whether he wanted it to be a comedy or tragedy. Also the first half hour or so of the film is very, VERY slow and lacks charm that is found in the second half. The idea, story, and structure for Juno is absolutely brilliant--but it could've been handled so much better.<br/><br/>Contrary to popular belief, Juno is not just for preppy teenage girls who have dumb boyfriends who want to knock them up. Like I said earlier, this is much more than a story about a pregnant teenager--it's a story about growing up and facing the world's challenges. Paired with wonderful acting, superb dialogue, a cute soundtrack, and a brilliant story, Juno turns out to be a great, cute film, whether you're old or young or male or female."
"thenolanfan","5","0","2","9 February 2020"," Ba screenplay, for a Best Screenplay
","Honestly, there is nothing impressive int this movie, the scenario is very similar to what you can find in teenager movie (very incoherent and throw up). The performances are very deceiving even the one of J. K. Simmons who late won a deserved Oscar for his role in Whiplash, but this movie is very overrated. To be more specific, I can say that some dialogues were very cliche, especially between Juno and Paulie Bleeker. For someone, who works with teenager every day, I also believe that this is a fairly bad depiction of what is going on in there head. Furthermore, to be honest, Ellen Page was too old for the role, and It made the movie far more incoherent at my eyes."

At that point I didn't know whether the movie was a cutesy treatment of teenage angst or an outright spoof of the Millennial generation. Scratch that, there didn't seem to be any angst here at all.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had with the entire movie was Juno's flippant attitude with just about everything that came her way. Can anyone be that disconnected from real life situations that have the potential to be life altering in unforeseen ways? The mid-stream course reversal by Mark Loring (Jason Bateman) also seemed to come out of left field. It sounded like the couple was trying for a baby for a long time, and now that one was on the horizon, he bails on his wife? The one thing I'm glad of is that the picture didn't have him make an outright play for Juno, because it looked like things were leaning in that direction with a couple of the set ups.<br/><br/>One thing I liked - this is only the second film I've ever seen that carried a reference to my favorite Seventies rock 'n roll band - Mott the Hoople. I never ran across anybody else who ever heard of them. In case you're wondering, the other picture was ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore""."

","Juno is sixteen year old and after she discovered she is pregnant things go in a lot ways. Movie is very powerful and will give a new view on many things and how teenagers may be able to process things. Paulie is Juno's best friend he shows us a great insight into a mind of teenager being aware of his actions but in the same time loving towards Juno. After changing her mind and deciding not to abort, Juno decides to give baby to a family that really wants it without knowing how things are going to be tough. Being so young it may seem weird and getting too many attention that is unwanted Juno starts to get in touch with Mark, a man who will adopt child, finding herself and him with many similarities in tastes. That led to emotional change inside him but also in her without realizing how inappropriate their friendship has become. Mark deciding to leave Vanessa shook her up but with good will of Juno she decided to leave child to Vanessa anyway. Juno realized alongside with Paulie that they love each other and that their life will be happy together. This is very emotional movie with some great dramatic moments that were filled with sadness but on the other hand it has a comedy in many scenes considering recklessness of Juno and her father also. Movie is amazingly written but directing of the movie was fine and some characters got too many screening time but had an ability to contribute to story greatly. JK Simmons and Ellen Page were incredible in the movie but sadly JK didn't got many attention but every scene that he is in was great. 3.5/4"

","Juno is why we go the movies or at least I do. I want to be touched, moved and enlightened by a story. Juno is a thoughtful and simple story told well. The cast includes well deserved Academy Award nomination for Ellen Page. She carries the character and the film with an honest moving portrayal of a teenager. Juno gets pregnant with her boyfriend's baby. She tried abortion but couldn't go through with it. Seeing an ad in the penny saver, she decides to let a couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) in nearby St Cloud. The story is set in the Minnesota suburbs. Juno lives with parents (Academy Award winner J.K. Simmons and Emmy winner Allison Janney). She has a supportive father and fine stepmother. Juno grows up among us as giving faith in movie making again. They need to make more films like this about everyday characters."

","Juno (2007): Dir: Jason Reitman / Cast: Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner, J.K. Simmons: Observant portrayal of teenage pregnancy that's both funny and charming. Juno is still in high school and learns that she is pregnant. At first she ponders abortion then adoption proves more favorable. Director Jason Reitman creates his second masterpiece after previously directing the innovative comedy Thank You For Smoking. Ellen Page is flawless as Juno throwing out dialogue of a teenager while caring enough to find the right parents for her unborn child. Michael Cera plays her boyfriend who is particularly distant and confused with regards to Page's pregnancy. Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner are well cast as the adoptive parents especially since both appear one way then end up crossing our expectations. Bateman is heavily into gory films and certainly fails to hide the fact that his vision of his future is far different than that of his wife. Garner is game for motherhood yet becomes a victim to gossip until Page is witness to the correct facts. Both individuals are put to the test but both also take very different methods in dealing with it. J.K. Simmons provides some great one-liners as Juno's father who is puzzled over the whole process. Strong theme regarding being a teenager and being a mother and knowing where to draw the line. Score: 10 / 10"

The movie nicely mix this with the dorky and goofy depiction of the focus characters, the really nice additions of comedy here and there, and some really nice twists and turns along the way. The movie nicely plays with the notion of viewer's anticipation of how it would wind up at times. I also really like how the soundtrack selection really completes the movie build up as its own taste. The songs really nail viewers' ears to the audio they are catchy in both lyrics and tunes. The acting overall is indeed worthy of an Oscar nomination at the least. Ellen Page nicely grasps her character and presents it, successfully deceiving viewers of her really age. Michael Cera is really comfortable with this kind of role so his performance doesn't seem that special. J.K.

","A smile-and-tears inducing wonderwork full of endearing characters, emotional resonance, and, for me, inspiration for when I raise teenagers.<br/><br/>At first, the supposedly hip dialogue seemed overwritten and thus grating, but about twenty minutes into th e film, I realized it had a purpose other than to set forth the movie's indie cred: to establish Juno, together with all the supporting characters, as unashamedly themselves. That character trait, together with its well-acted, not-overwritten portrayal of teenagers wrestling with a complex array of emotions and relationships (what teenager doesn't feel like they're wrestling with that), is why I like it (and Juno, the character) so much.<br/><br/>A word about the soundtrack, which is selling briskly: It is thoroughly unimpressive, with the Kinks and Mott the Hoople samples coming across as overwrought as used in the film, and the Moldy Peaches offerings annoyingly undersung (like lots of acoustic indie music, I find). Perhaps high school in Minnesota sounds like this, but for me, it stands that the only musical highlight of the film is an affecting duet by the two main characters.<br/><br/>Anyway, I love this movie, and I love its characters. Juno is my favorite among the 2007 films I've seen so far, with Ratatouille, 3:10 to Yuma, and Breach coming in as runners-up."

","The first time that I saw Ellen Page was in Inception and she did not make much of an impression in that movie. In Juno, she proves what she is capable of when given a promising script with a strong character. Juno completely belongs to her and the free-spirited, open-minded Juno is perfectly depicted by Ellen Page. At the beginning of the movie, Juno finds out that she is pregnant. Instead of being alarmed, she tries to go for an abortion but could not go through with it. Eventually, she decides to keep the baby and give it to a couple for adoption. Juno has an underlying message about giving life. What makes the movie stand out is the use of colloquial language and slangs which correctly depict the present world. The movie goes by in a breeze and I must say that it was a wonderful experience. Don't miss it."

","Teen pregnancy is not a new subject matter for the movies, but it is given a strikingly original and fresh coat of paint in the 2007 film Juno, a riveting comedy-drama that provides consistent entertainment and flawed, believable characters that speak without filters and remain steeped in realism.<br/><br/>The film stars Ellen Page as Juno MacGuff, a 16-year old girl who finds herself pregnant after a one night stand with her boyfriend (Michael Cera) who decides that she is going to allow the baby to be adopted by a seemingly happy, upwardly mobile couple named Mark and Vanessa (Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner) and how the plan veers in some very unexpected directions.<br/><br/>Diablo Cody's brilliant, Oscar-winning screenplay anchors the proceedings because it skips over a lot of the clichéd issues normally addressed in films on this subject matter. I liked the fact that there was no discussion about Juno keeping the baby, I liked that she knows from jump that she is no position to be a mother and I like that Juno agreed to a closed adoption, meaning that once the baby is born, she hands him over and has no more contact with the baby or his new family. Also loved the unconditional support Juno received from her father (JK Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney).<br/><br/>What I didn't like is the way Juno pretty much shut the father out of her initial decision-making and the relationship that develops between Juno and Mark really had me squirming...I knew it was wrong for Juno to be getting this close to Mark; on other hand, it was also clear to me early on that Mark and Vanessa were not as happy as they pretended to be for Juno. There is a wonderful scene between Bateman and Garner where they are looking at possible colors for the nursery and the tension between them is real and burns a hole through the screen, which can only be attributed to the skillful directorial hand of Jason Reitman, who had already proved himself to me with Thank you for Smoking.<br/><br/>Ellen Page turns in a star-making performance in the title role, a performance that earned her an Oscar nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress and she receives solid support from Bateman, Simmons, Janney, and especially Jennifer Garner, who blew me away with the performance of her career as Vanessa, the woman who wants to be a mother more than anything and you just know is not going to be able to withstand another disappointment. Especially loved the scene where Vanessa ran into Juno at the mall and Juno allowed her to talk to the unborn baby in Juno's belly.<br/><br/>Some inventive camera work and a lovely song score are the finishing touches on this unique and moving film that quietly sails through the soul to an extremely satisfying denouement."

I loved it, absolutely, but never got around to viewing it again until last night. AndI had previously purchased it on BluRay months ago!<br/><br/>I loved it just as much now as I did back then. The writing, from soon-to-be mediocre Diablo Cody, was excellent for this project. The normal dialect from teens would normally turn me off – and would get worse as Facebook grew in popularity, but I absolutely adored it here. This is all due to the once in a lifetime, perfect performance by Ellen Page as the title character.<br/><br/>She was so great, so real, so believable, she doesn't just carry the child, er, movie, she keeps us highly entertained even when a lot of other great filmmaking techniques and performances might go unnoticed from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Best high school buds, Juno and Paulie (the always wonderful, Michael Cera) ""decide"" to have sex one night and in ""a chair that started it all."" Lo, behold, she's now with child and after an abortion debate within herself, she decides on making a obviously unhappy couple happy again. But, will a child complete the Pennysaver advertising's couple's family? Will Juno find who she's always been searching for? Will she ever light that pipe she incessantly sucking on, even though she's pregnant? <br/><br/>The supporting cast is excellent – including great scenes with the always wonderful J.K. Simmons, Allison Janney and (definitely not the normal role for) Jason Bateman. The score is good, the cinematography is surprisingly great and, as mentioned, the soundtrack that started the movie with a bang, is absolutely and breathtakingly marvelous.<br/><br/>While still giving the enormously hilarious movie 5/5 stars, I'm surprised on how toned down Cera was in this. As a big fan of his, and how he normally steals every scene he's involved in and usually has the best dialogue, it was amazing on how reserved he was in this while letting Page command the screen. Probably that was the intention, but it was freaky not seeing Cera dominate the screen.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, coming from a fan of just a handful of teen-related movies, such as Clueless, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Election and, of course, the John Hughes collection, I add this almost masterpiece of a teen angst film to the list. It was so real, so involving and so funny, I can't wait to finally see it a third time.<br/><br/>Now, you must buy this movie and following its closing credits, search and purchase the soundtrack. If you loved the movie, you should already have a crush on the music."

","No wonder that the screenplay received Academy Award - it is skilfully written and is realistic. Well, probably there are not too many cases where all parties reach consensus, but still... Of course, the topics of abortion and teen motherhood are sensitive and conservative viewers might condemn the way they were approached. Anyhow, the characters are deliberated and wonderfully performed; Ellen Page has the leading role, there are a few scenes without her; all supporting actors are catchy as well (Michael Cera is a nice character actor). The scenes develop in a logical manner and the ending is pleasantly versatile as well - and not fully predictable. With warm and romantic undertones, though.<br/><br/>The music/soundtrack has also a role in the movie's huge success, the calm and and slow songs complement the moods in a very suitable way. They are mostly related to Juno's thoughts or deeds.<br/><br/>This movie is highly recommended - and not to young people only.

So, it's not about the decision, it's about making your own path.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that try to drown us in the ""perfect"" world of film making. We follow a small reconstituted family, that's not completely happy, but not at each other's throat. Everyone as flaws as well as qualities. All of the personas have depth, and layers, and you can feel it. The environment they live in is just as rich in details. The script is perfectly novel, the acting is great, without reproach, and the pacing just right.<br/><br/>Ellen Page fits her role to a T.

On the other hand I think that Ellen has performed the role of Juno well. The plot is just like all the other films. Starts good, something happens and ends with her getting back together with Paulie, even though she said she didn't have feelings for him, flirted with another guy. But still a happy ending. Also the humor used I find very annoying and not funny. I think the writer tries to hard. Furthermore Juno is not realistic and I think that Juno also lack emotions. For example the scene when she tells her parents that she is pregnant. There is not emotions and the parents just take her side and support her, the don't even raise there voices at her. She is sixteen and pregnant what parents would not raise there voice. I think that the songs they have picked to be played in the background are good as they add atmosphere to the scene.

","Juno The budget for this film was $7,500,000. It was released in 2007 in the USA but 2008 in the UK and runs for 96 minutes. Juno is about a young 16-year-old girl, called Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), she falls pregnant from her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Micheal Cera). Juno must decide what to do with the unborn child. She decides to let her baby go and looks for foster parents with her friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby). The adoptive parents seem to be perfect, Juno gets carried away with how good they seem to be, and starts invading their personal space. Everything seems to be fine and sorted out, yet the adoptive father (Mark Loring (Jason Bateman)) breaks the deal and leaves the wife, this has a very large emotional impact on Juno, and she goes to her friend Paulie for help. Juno is a very bright and colourful film; its intentions are not to be realistic, or have a dark atmosphere, but to appeal to a wider audience by making the film less localised. The soundtrack in this film is all-acoustic, it feels as if the songs are not edited and the lyrics usually tell a story.<br/><br/>Ellen Page played the role very well, Micheal Cera was funny and added a very lightening view to the story."

"ElMaruecan82","8","0","3","5 September 2012"," I hated it, then I liked it ... but each time for the 'wrong reasons' ...
","Anyone with an IMDb account is old enough to remember the phenomenon ""Juno"" was in 2007, much more than the independent-movie-of-the-year, it was an unidentified cinematic object buzzing in Hollywood's sky. No one saw it coming, a movie written by an ex-stripper with an allusive pen name (Diablo Cody), directed by a film-maker whose last name was more famous than the first (Ivan as Reitman Jr.), and featuring new faces, Ellen Page, Michael Cera who was not type-casted yet as the awkward-teenager. ""Juno"" was new and style-wise, it was clearly establishing its distance from typical teenage movies.<br/><br/>But I thought the film was needlessly excessive in its style, as if the director was obsessed with the idea of creating something hip, cool, pop, whatever. I couldn't get off my mind how atypical Juno was, and how typical her annoying best friend was, how overly nice were Juno's father and step-mother (Allison Braney) and how innocent was Paulie Bleeker, the unwilling father played by Cera. I thought the film was trying too hard to contradict all the teen- movies' stereotypes; and indeed, it was praised for that and I can see why  but I didn't feel its spontaneity, I thought it was like calculated, even formatted, as if beneath the script, there was a sort of Marketing Junior manager who made a brainstorm about 'How to create an original film'. I know it's supposed to be an independent production, but regarding its success, the story's sincerity should be questioned.<br/><br/>However, I didn't dislike the character either, there was something appealing that wasn't so obvious. I guess the film was like pregnant of its own emotional core, only visible after we get used to the characters. Take the idea of the passing of time, it's regularly suggested in the film through the seasons and the way nature influences the environment as much as Juno's learning process. The film is in fact, as moody, spontaneous and capricious as Juno's mind can get. And that's how I reconciled with its 'calculated' spontaneity and prefabricated wit. When I sincerely wanted to strangle one character or two, I realized it was part of the characterization itself. I thought the stepmother was too rude with the nurse who was obviously reacting to Juno's lack of emotional reaction, as I wanted Juno's stupid friend to shut her mouth or stop dancing in the hospital, but how many times did I have this feeling toward people in real-life. <br/><br/>I thought maybe this was the paradoxical nature of ""Juno"", to feel irritatingly real when it tries to be cinematically memorable  I used to think on the contrary that it was sometimes irritatingly cinematic when it tried to be realistically memorable. It showed off a lot, but it's almost forgivable as it's part of Juno's age. And this is what the film is, through a simple journey into pregnancy; it's the coming-of-age of an insouciant teen-ager, a girl of her era, facing the responsibility of an irresponsible act, as a major step in the adult world, while, she's as much a child as the little human being she carries. But on that aspect, the film deals with pregnancy much better than what I would have expected, and considerably redeems its flaws in my opinion.<br/><br/>Typically, I avoided ""Juno"", thinking it would be some kind of feminist preach for the right of women to dispose with her body. Well, ""Juno"" doesn't waste its time in the ""to keep or not to keep"" dilemma, it's pretty clear that for Juno, abortion doesn't rhyme with option. And don't get me wrong, I'm not a pro-life advocate but I'm tired of the constant trivialization of abortion in the name of so many human rights. I know a baby looks like a shrimp in the early days, but life is still big deal, and it's not a sort of take-it or leave-it package. Aborting in my opinion says a lot, about the consumerist attitudes that conduct our different choices, and the merit of ""Juno"" is to get its character surprisingly involved in the process of preparing a baby for a couple who wants to adopt. <br/><br/>""Juno"", literally strikes by its conservative message through the powerful chronicle of an act of generosity, giving a proper meaning to the word 'carrying life' and marvelously incarnated by Jennifer Garner's performance, which should have earned her more accolades. Maybe, Diablo Cody is a ultra-feminist but then, she didn't use her character to make a feminist statement. Sure, men are not given very deep roles, and if the film is made by a woman who know about women, it should have given more depth to the male side, but still, it happens to provide a beautiful message about motherhood, even as something that shouldn't be taken for granted, but that exists in the heart of every girl: this desire to give life.<br/><br/>Garner plays with perfection the desperateness of a woman motivated to become what she believes is the reason-to-be of women, while her husband Mark still mourns his artistic dreams and develops a complicity with Juno, based on horror movies and punk-music, which says a lot about his degree of maturity. Characters do feel real after all, and at the end, ""Juno"" is not a plot's film; it's about a slice in the life of people far from being one-dimensional. I thought the film was trying too much to be original, smart, hip, cool, moody and spontaneous, but so was Juno  but there is a heart inside and it waits a little before blooming. I realized that when I saw Bleeker and Juno together and Juno crying, they still loved each other.<br/><br/>The so-called ""Juno"" effect makes me hope that the image of woman carrying life will never becomes old-fashioned or synonym of conservatism. Or maybe after disliking ""Juno"" for wrong reasons, I feel like like it now but again for the wrong reasons."

","I can't say that Juno is necessarily realistic in the way the some of the characters handle Juno's unexpected pregnancy, but I don't think that was the point. The point was to explore the different meanings of love through numerous and varied characters, and in that sense this film is very successful. Some of the dialogue is quite frank, which definitely provides for some comical moments, and everything is done rather straightforwardly, but that adds to the quirkiness of the film, and without the amazing screenplay by Diablo Cody, not to mention Jason Reitman's very sure direction, this film would be nothing.<br/><br/>Ellen Page does an incredible job as a teenager, despite getting pregnant at such a young age, acting beyond her years in maturity in dealing with the situation, and yet she is still a child at heart, and wants so deeply to hold on to that, which is shown in everything from the way she dresses, to the things in her room, to the very fitting and sort of indie soundtrack that goes along with the movie. Michael Cera does a great job as Juno's shy and diffident best friend, Paulie Bleeker. He doesn't get very involved with the pregnancy, and almost seems unaffected by it until the end, when everything sort of starts to fall apart and come together at the same time. Their relationship is fantastic--some of the best parts of the film are the few times they're together. Everyone else in the cast, from Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, to Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons also do well in their roles. Ellen Page, however is still by far the star of this movie--no one else could've played this role except her.<br/><br/>What sets this movie apart from others, though, is it's feel, and there's really no other way to describe that, except perhaps maybe the way it makes you feel. The whole film, despite dealing with very mature subject matter, is almost casual and laid back. It is not immature or inappropriate in the way that it handles the complex situations it throws its characters into, but it does so very lightly, only brushing on the mature parts, which is somewhat childish, but this is from a teenager's point-of-view. It is not a feel-good movie, and yet you do feel good at the end, not necessarily because of how the movie ended, but because how the characters got to that ending. <br/><br/>It's kind of a love story, but more of a quest to discover what love truly is, which sounds a little corny, but the characters don't even know that that's what they're doing the entire time. This is all shown brilliantly throughout the end sequences, which were probably designed to elicit tears, but at that point you should be too self-satisfied with how everything turned out to be able to cry."

","The movie ""Juno"" is about a young high school girl, Juno (Ellen Page), who unexpectedly gets pregnant with her good friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera) and we are taken through the struggles and difficulties she goes through. Instead of having an abortion like she had originally planned, she decides to give the baby up for adoption to someone who desperately wants a baby and can give the baby a better home. The movie is mixed with ironic humor and blatant reality as it portrays how a pregnant teen may feel and be treated in this situation. The comedic spin on this film helps to lighten the situation and bring a fresh entertaining spin to a common reality. The theme of the film is focused on the complexity of relationships and the struggles of the teen years. The struggles between Juno and Bleeker, a young first love are played out as well as struggles between Vanessa(Jennifer Garner) and Mark(Jason Bateman), the couple Juno decided to give the baby to. The difficulties in dealing with parents as well as teachers and piers as a teen who is pregnant are portrayed in a realistic and yet funny way that is both entertaining and touching. Juno has a similarity to the film ""Knocked Up"" as the themes in both movies have to do with unplanned pregnancies and complex relationships in an other than ideal situation and is given a comedic spin to bring a lightened and entertaining feature to these films. Juno differs in that the main characters are teens a more subtle, quirky kind of comedy is used. The lighting in the film that was used is very natural lighting. Many of the scenes were either shot outside or were given the illusion that outside or natural lighting was used. The night scenes were kind of dim and felt like they were shot in a regular family room. These uses of lighting seemed to give the film a realistic feel and like you were friends with Juno who was just alongside her throughout the film. The sound in this film was unique. The music used was well selected in placement and choices as it portrayed Juno and Bleeker as laid back and both kind of quirky and not mainstream. Just by using these music choices we are given an inside view at these two without full descriptions or backgrounds being given. Also, throughout the film Ellen Page does a voice over narration for Juno in certain parts of the film to give an inside point of view of Juno and what she's thinking and going through in ways that aren't verbally expressed in the dialogue of the characters of the film. The movie ""Juno"" does an excellent job portraying the pressures and struggles of teens as Juno goes through her teen pregnancy and how judgmental others can be. Along with this insight, the comedy in the film brings a sense of lightness and positive attitude to an otherwise stressful situation."

","This is a high-quality, feel-good, teen movie that has unfortunately managed to offend some people with very firmly-held beliefs. <br/><br/>Really excellent performances from all the cast - especially Ellen Page as the pregnant girl - and an intelligent, funny script helped this low-budget movie to achieve considerable popularity and many awards when it was released. Seeing it for the first time five years later it still feels fresh, funny and heart-warming without being stupidly schmaltzy. <br/><br/>The film is idealistic rather than realistic - and almost surreal rather than gritty.<br/><br/>Juno, the central character, retains her quirky, irreverent and perhaps a little unnaturally mature good humour through most of the tribulations of bearing the unexpected child. She expects nothing from the endearingly ineffectual father, played by Michael Cera, and he delivers it very well. She is also ably supported by her best friend and her sympathetic and caring parents. Abortion is considered lightly and cast aside. Yuppy adoptive parents are selected and the twists and turns in the mind of the adoptive father add just enough stress to Juno's harmonious existence to make for a proper story.<br/><br/>So what's not to like? You'd be surprised. Quite a number of reviewers have projected their stresses about the real world onto this very fictional fiction. Why can't they lighten up?<br/><br/>Anyway, it seems that the main problem is that the film portrays the experience of going through with having the child as far too painless and positive for the young Juno. Apparently, she should have been portrayed as conflicted, angry, stupid, constantly in pain, nasty brutish and short. The only one of these she managed was to be short. Her naturally positive attitude largely carried her through, while some people, presumably committed pro-abortion campaigners, think that her life should have been ruined.<br/><br/>Then it also seems that her parents were too supportive, that she shouldn't have visited the adoptive parents unannounced, and that it was so unrealistic as to be almost incredible that she might have initiated the sex herself.<br/><br/>And then last, but it seems not least, is that the film was masquerading as an ""Indie"" film when, in reality it wasn't one. <br/><br/>Just enjoy the film and forget about the hang-ups! And if you actually have a young daughter that gets pregnant, this film is just about compulsory viewing to prove that the world doesn't have to be such a bad place after all."
"CarusProductions","Null","0","1","14 March 2012"," The Defnition of Indie
","""Juno"" is a quirky 2007 comedy written by Diablo Cody, receiving an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and directed by Montreal's own Jason Reitman, it stars Ellen Page as the offbeat teen who faces a difficult decision on how to deal with her unexpected pregnancy.<br/><br/>The film begins in autumn, where Juno (Page) is seen getting rid of the chair which began the journey. The chair is where her and her best friend Paulie Bleeker (played by Michael Cera), the unconventional athlete and star of their high school track team, first conceived their child.<br/><br/>After three pregnancy tests, we first hear Cody's unique twist on words, which gives ""Juno"" a language of its own. Rollo the store owner (played by Rainn Wilson) says, ""That ain't no Etch-A-Sketch. This is one doodle that can't be un-did, Homeskillet."" Thus begins a series of memorable quotes that will leave viewers quoting the film hours after watching.<br/><br/>Being a low-budget indie flick, what makes ""Juno"" great is the stylistic use of music references, and the fact Juno is a teen unlike no other. She owns a hamburger phone, speaks her mind, and is- pregnant.<br/><br/>Even if Juno does act grown-up for her young sixteen years, she is still a model for a typical modern teenage girl who only wants the best for herself. She might not be ready for motherhood, but understands the difficult decision in the scene at the abortion clinic. After Sue-Chin mentions the baby already has fingernails, all Juno can hear are fingernails in the waiting room, which develop a rhythm of their own as her anxiety grows.<br/><br/>The stares she receives from classmates don't faze her. Juno's main concern is for her child to have perfect parents in a stable home- everything she didn't have growing up since her own parents divorced ten years prior. Nevertheless, history is repeated when Mark Loring (Jason Bateman) realizes he is not ready to be a father, and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) is to adopt Juno's baby on her own.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is memorable and far from predictable. Juno is mature for her age and behaves as though she doesn't care about her child, but in the car scene after she finds out Mark and Vanessa are getting a divorce, she breaks down crying, wondering whether or not families are built to last.<br/><br/>The use of folk music, unique characters and fun tongue-twister dialogue defines the indie genre to perfection. Despite being a comedy, there may be several scenes which will require the viewer to hold a tissue nearby.<br/><br/>After Juno has her child, it is springtime. Cherry blossoms fill the neighborhood as she rides her bike to visit Paulie, the one who has been there for her all along.<br/><br/>The story ends- with a chair. Vanessa is seen holding Juno's baby in a rocking chair, making ""Juno"" a perfect circle of a movie for everyone to see."

","In the movie Juno, a young teenage girl played by Ellen Page named Juno gets impregnated by her best guy friend Paulie Bleeker, who is played by Michael Cera, after only having had sex once. Juno is a unique and spunky teenager who decides that she cannot go through with an abortion so her best friend Leah, played by Olivia Thirlby, helps her find what seems to be the perfect couple. The couple, Vanessa and Mark Loring, played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman, is an upper middle class family who has wanted a baby for some time. As the movie progresses you learn that Mark is not ready for a baby and misses the days where he was a ""rock star."" After wondering if Mark has developed some feelings for Juno that are not so innocent you do find out that he is leaving Vanessa. Juno finds this extremely upsetting because she wanted the perfect family to raise her baby but after doing some thinking she decides that if Vanessa is still willing to go through with the adoption without Mark so is she. Juno then questions love and its lasting capabilities and after a talk with her father, played by J.K. Simmons, she decides to express her deeper feelings for Bleeker. At the end of the movie Juno has the baby and Vanessa becomes a mom, while Juno goes on to live the life of a high school student with Bleeker as her boyfriend.<br/><br/>The theme to this movie is one about love, both falling in love and love falling apart. Throughout the movie Juno struggles with her feelings for Bleeker but does not want to express them out of fear, maybe from the fact that her parents are divorced. Her struggles can be seen in the scenes where her best friend Leah teases her about Bleeker. Then there is the theme of love falling apart between Vanessa and Mark. This part is not as sad as you might think because throughout the movie you can tell Mark is not excited about becoming a father. So by him leaving it is actually quite a relief and Vanessa, who has wanted nothing more than to be a mom, still goes through with the adoption. The use of rack focus in the scene where Vanessa holds her baby for the first time was very appropriate and added depth to the scene.<br/><br/>This film reminds me a lot of Napoleon Dynamite in many ways. Napoleon Dynamite uses a similar type of humor that is not laugh out loud but when you leave you feel as though you've just watched one of the funniest movies ever, Juno leave you feeling the same way. Napoleon Dynamite is also centered on a quirky teenager in high school dealing with friendship and a crush. Awkward teenage love is something that we all can relate to and Juno almost makes you wish you could go back and redo it."

The tension felt by Best Friend at the mall, also the mall being the only scene where best friend and new mum can be seen together, also the created disaster re Soup Girl. It is the comparison with the first quarter that makes this part feel weak. <br/><br/>Wheels within wheels, I consider that while this is a story that hangs together well, that hidden behind that is maybe a very different story, a modern politics story. As such, Juno would not be alone, there are many, many more. It might even be that such an aspect is not so deliberate, that when the storytellers create a truly magnificent story it will just be incorporating stuff that they accept as sense? <br/><br/>If so, just what does the hidden story relate to?

It just happened and Juno deals with it her way, which is a little bit odd, as she is. It is truly rare that such a big issue, as teen pregnancy is, is treated in such a fresh and open minded way. That's great.<br/><br/>The dialogs, especially Juno's and the ones she has with her parents, are excellent, but the script shows up and downs regarding the story in general and the dialogs of other main characters. The roles of the future adoptive parents are stereotypical and predictable, although respond to human reactions that we find in real life.<br/><br/>The performance of the supporting actors here is excellent, and both the actors playing Juno's father and step mother are great, sincere and believable in their roles. The same re the actor who plays Juno's boyfriend, who I found adorable. The roles of the adopting couple are not that good, and the performance of Jennifer Garner and the actor who plays her husband are mediocre, sometimes over the top, which unbalances the overall tone of the film.<br/><br/>Ellen Page is a talented young actress, and her quirky character goes well with that quirkiness she has as a person. I think that her nomination for an Oscar was excessive as her performance in Hard Candy was far better and more complex and demanding and she was not nominated.

And, overall, the film is good as well. Not great, but worthwhile.<br/><br/>A word for those annoyed about the abortion angle. Okay. This film couldn't be made if she didn't stay pregnant. So, her deciding not to abort, though that scene is a tad bit much, is necessary. I agree it was not really taken seriously though many teens don't decide one way or the other that seriously, if we are honest about it.

The film follows the life of 16-year old Juno who has just discovered that she is pregnant with her best friend Bleeker. Juno is a quirky, off-beat and almost surreal storyline, it develops, and this was probably the intention, on an artificial plane.<br/><br/>Juno, is the most mature 16-year old I'd imagine you will ever come across. Juno's use of words run across a scale where a dictionary would be a handy, to the usual colloquialisms of youth. Ellen Page plays Juno very well but it really is not a 16-year old she is enacting, it is a maturer person. It is hard to really except that such a 16 year-old and her family would be so calm and considerate on the discovery of the pregnancy.<br/><br/>The screenplay, written by Cody, has a good quality and shows her potential. However, with the artificial plot comes scenes, moments which seem to be there to showcase the talents of Cody. The film just doesn't flow at times and is setup to deliver lines which do not seem to be embedded in logic.<br/><br/>Off tangent but nonetheless something I must mention are the musical interludes, overtures which I found to be ill advised. In Juno, it plays way too much music to be seen as considered pieces, and is rather overly done and over-cooked.<br/><br/>Juno is almost fairytale like and although I can accept it is not meant to be based on 'real life' I am a little disgruntled that it seems to incorporate too many 'one-liners' and implausible dialogue . Juno does show Cody's talent, potential and self-assurance but it has a sense of self-indulgence. I must mention Michael Cera (Bleeker) whose performance I very much enjoyed."

","I've just commented on Aronofsky/Rourke's ""The Wrestler"". Also, i've seen recently a great simple Belgian film, ""Moscow, Belgium"". The reason why it matters to connect these 2 films to this ""Juno"" is one: all of them are what you see, none of them pretends to be more than it is. They are honest, visceral, and straight-forward pieces of cinema. The 3 films caught the sympathy of the audiences (though the Belgian obviously didn't have the distribution of the other 2). Is this important? Maybe not, or maybe it's the sign of a tendency. Maybe the audiences are expecting to be more touched and less impressed. To be led to feel, instead of being forced to rationalize. I think that recent years have brought beautiful intellectual developments to cinema, but there is a counter-point necessary to keep films on the entertainment level, to make them invite people to watch them. Something someone like, say, Medem, did a few times. (even though his ambitious Caótica Ana was so misunderstood by the public). This Juno is a non-intellectual, visceral piece of film. It's simplistic for better and worse. Why it had so much success is, i suppose, because it took heavy themes lightly. It avoided connecting teenager pregnancy to social breakdown, to personal lives limitations. Ellen Paige was a good cast having that in mind, as well as Simmons.<br/><br/>Does a film like this make my day? Does it fully satisfies me? No it doesn't, i look for more, i want to find more in a film than what there is at first sight. I want to wake up in the middle of the night, wondering about certain things, finding out more about what the director meant with certain things. I want to carry images with me, i want the sensation that i met someone, that a director, or an actor, or a cinematographer showed something of what he has inside. But this is good enough for what it is. It's unpretentious in the way that it is what we see. It's intellectually honest because it doesn't moralize. I sometimes am tired of seeing films that are totally the opposite of what they stand for, films that pretend to encourage free-thinking but themselves are all part of a big mounting-line, all the same, all boring and made following formulas. I admit, and even welcome a film as this one, for it refreshes things. But i hope this doesn't become a rule. I hope we can still count in the future with the developments of Medem, Iñarritu or Kar-Wai.<br/><br/>But this IS entertaining and honest, and that was its point.<br/><br/>My opinion: 3/5 <br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

Juno you are a wonderful film, sorry it took me so long to come around.<br/><br/>**************************************************************<br/><br/>For starters I didn't hate Juno. I thought Ellen Page was charming (though I agree with so many others in that her character could be annoying and pretentious). I also liked the rest of the cast. However, The story line of teen pregnancy is an old one. We've all seen countless movies on the subject matter so if you are going to make a film on this subject, you need to bring something new to the table which this film clearly didn't do.<br/><br/>If this was just some throwaway indie film, I would have walked away from this thinking, okay, it was cute but when you hear buzz about how great this is and then HBO gives it 3.5 stars (which is the same rating they give The Color Purple), there are expectations that this film is special; it isn't. Could it have been more than it was? I don't think so. If you are reading this review and want to watch this film go into it not expecting anything great. Maybe if my expectations weren't so high, I would have given it another star, who knows?"
"ExcluziveSyne","6","0","3","7 January 2009"," Drifts away from reality, in an attempt to satisfy everyone.
","Quite a fuss made about this movie. So I rented it. Glass of wine for company and about one hour and a half before my iPod's battery would die. So let us melt our eyes, trying to watch a movie in a 2 inch display.<br/><br/>A cute teenage girl, facing a constantly growing belly, who describes herself as a cautionary whale (her dad calls her Junebug), a 16 year old boy, that's now discovering the world of sex, that also, ironically enough, happens to be the baby's father and a couple of adults, who are ""sexually active"" (which by the way is a perfectly understandable expression, contrary to Juno's beliefs), but cannot conceive, so they put up an ad in a paper, asking for a baby to spare. And who can forget the secondary characters, like Juno's dad and stepmom, Mac and Brenda, or Juno's dumb cheerleader friend, Leah? <br/><br/>Regarding plot, don't expect anything special; kid gets pregnant with unwanted baby, kid gives it away, kid lives happily ever after. But in the end, the characters are richer for the experience, and regain hope on true, never fading love. I like that, it's a positive message for a movie. Kinda overwhelmed by Hollywood clichés, but I guess it's better than High School Musical or the likes.<br/><br/>Now, Juno is a character, which, I think, many people can, or better, want to relate to. She's a simple teenage girl, curious about life, has real emotions and believes in love, and, although being a victim of the situation, she takes control of it and handles it graciously. Yes, Juno is a girl many girls want to be alike. But as heart-warming and touching her character was, I found the attempt, or better, the obsession of the creators to make her just a typical girl, to have brought out some bad parts out of her. For instance, while watching the movie, and you're 50 minutes in, you find the constant teenage slang, (50% of which you can't hear teenagers say) to be getting tired. From that point of view, you can see that Juno parts ways with reality. The girl that is dragged around by her urges, somehow manages to carry out this next to impossible task, on her own, always making the right decisions? In addition to that, her love confession was nothing but convincing. No, this was supposed to be the best moment of hers, but it turned out to be the worst. I personally didn't get won over by her words. <br/><br/>Bleeker. Gotta hand it to the writer, Bleeker as a character was thought out, and realistic. Just think about how he always ran miles, yet never got any muscles at all; he did work out, but he wasn't a jog. He was a father of a child, yet he was still essentially a kid, on his own. No mustache, no facial hair. He was exactly the type of guy that Juno wanted. He has no backbone, he's a scared kid, so he's staying away from the whole pregnancy thing. But he, on his part, never stops liking Juno, which is something I respect in him.<br/><br/>Now Mark and Vanessa are the best part of the movie. They're story of their own, enclosed in the general plot. Mark, a victim of his music and his talent, that never gave up on being a rockstar, and Vanessa, exactly the opposite, a grown up woman, who has made up her mind on what she wants; she wants a little crying, pooping, screaming, but oh so cute, thing called a baby. Theoretically, the characters seem fine, but every time they were portrayed, the atmosphere was way uncomfortable, and not in a way premeditated by the director. I can't put my finger on why this happened, maybe it was Vanessa's constant uptightness, maybe the whole Mark-Juno situation which brought out a feeling of something not right happening there, I don't know. What I do know is that the characters that had the most potential didn't stand up to my expectations. <br/><br/>Acting, that's a whole different story now. Page (Juno) wasn't anything special; an acceptable performance, for a mediocre role. It's not hard to play a teenager, which is more or less one dimensional. The script just landed perfectly on her personality; she didn't have to put much work to get into the role, because, at some extend, she was playing herself as a teenager. Besides, she maybe overdid it. She focused so much on being a simple teenager, that she came out much stupider than she wanted her character to be. Cera (Bleeker) was annoying, but the overall performance was good. Bateman (Mark), a simple role, executed well, and Garner (Vanessa) carried out her role quite decently. Everyone else, including Juno's sister, who apparently doesn't talk, were fine.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Juno is a film describing a plausible situation, but it's cluttered; the writer set up a situation with a lot of potential at the start, but trying to fit too many things in just one a half hour didn't turn out nicely. It looks like Diablo Cody ended it too quickly, and as a result, not all loose ends could be tighten up. I feel another hour would have done this flick justice, but apparently that was impossible. So we ended up having a movie that is nowhere near bad, but far from excellent, as well. The matter of teen pregnancy is handled very poorly in the movie, and the point of view is flat. No peer disapproval, no internal mental continuous struggles, just a girl that decides halfway through the movie, to look if true love is out there . Lot of potential, once again, promising characters, but too much fuss for something that didn't really deserve it."

","As I watched this, the first 20 minutes of the movie found me getting more than a bit annoyed at the oh-so-cool, over-confident, old-beyond-her-years central character. It just didn't sit well with me.<br/><br/>But as the film progresses, you kind of understand what they were trying to do - overplay the intelligent cockiness and confidence to make the later 'realisation' and new-found sensitivity more 'powerful'.<br/><br/>It's a little bit pretentious, and it does try a little too hard at times to be quirky and 'indie', plus some of the characters are overplayed - but ultimately it's fun, and watchable."

","Every so often I have to completely shut down my movie intake to preserve my enthusiasm for the medium. It's not that I expect consistent high art, deep existential narratives, and labyrinthine complex characters and am frequently let down. I enjoy great trash as much as the next guy. But after awhile the sameness of mainstream cinema just gets to me. The feeling that I've seen this movie before. That I can look down at a stopwatch and recite verbatim the events as they unfolds on screen without ever actually observing them.<br/><br/>The feeling of ""Why am I watching this movie?"" <br/><br/>Perhaps that's why I react so strongly to films like Juno who, like it's quasi-animated opening credits, strolls along on a whim at its own quirky pace while downing a jug of SunnyD. Sure, like all stories, there's a conflict, complications, and a resolution, but Juno does so while whistling to its own goofy guitar riffs and gets to the inevitable destination whenever it feels like it with refreshingly little fanfare. So let me grab my guitar, a 64oz blue slushie, and a vase to throw up in, and we'll get this review under way.<br/><br/>The film understands a fundamental principle of human nature that many formulaic tear-jerker fail to get  that grandiose posturing doesn't necessarily resonate with the audience, nor does it capture the imagination. We've heard that song and dance before, and because of blatant whoring and oversaturation, we now dial it out. But those weird and awkward tidbits? Those freaky bits of nonsense trivia? Those are the things that make us stop and ask, ""say what?"" Soon after discovering her pregnancy, Juno goes to an abortion clinic where she runs into a classmate protesting, chanting the Pro-Life agenda  how babies have hearts and feelings, yadda, yadda, yadda. Juno sighs, rolls her eyes, and presses on. And, you know what? Babies have fingernails too. Now Juno pauses, furrows her brow and turns around, ""fingernails?"" Then suddenly, everywhere she looks, those blasted fingernails haunt her, scratching at her, rapping on a noisy surface impatiently just to p*ss her off.<br/><br/>This scene and Juno's decision to keep the child rolls by without letting the pro-life/pro-choice debate dominate the narrative. It carries the appropriate weight it should for a girl in her shoes, but never stoops to propaganda for one side or the other. It's a part of Juno's story, it helps shapes who she is, thus it's an unavoidable tangent handled with grace and subtlety.<br/><br/>Going on the hunt to find adoptive parents, I expected Juno to interview a number of potential parents in that obligatory montage of freaky-rific, hill-billy-tastic, and spaz-happy couples that these movies seem to require. It never came. Instead, her and a friend read through personal ads, dismissing the prospective parents as though deciding what CD they're in the mood for, and then Juno comes across Mark and Vanessa. That's it. That's the couple. Can we get some happily ever after music? What? Still have to go through with the rest of the movie? Okay, fine.<br/><br/>As Juno and her dear old dad drive out to meet the aspiring parents, we detect something amiss as we see towels and cuff-links straightened, magazines strategically laid out on the coffee table, and an obsessive compulsive attention to tidiness. It resonates with almost sinister intentions like the pair are hiding something, and this feeling underscores the narrative through the following conflicts.<br/><br/>Though impressed in general, none of these efforts really resonate with Juno ... until she spots a Les Paul tucked away in another room. I watched with fascination as a connection bloomed between Juno and Mark during their brief jam session. That is before obsessive-compulsive Vanessa breaks up the party. The seeds of that friendship further develop when Juno stops by to show off her ultra-sound, and she gets into a discussion with Mark whether Argento or Gordon reigns as the grandmaster of horror. It's not the relationship one would expect from a man and woman spending time with each other in one of these films, rather a kinship. She treats Mark like a strange cross between a father and a best friend and really wants her child to be with this pair because they're more mature than she is (they're old, after all) and, hey, this guy has good taste.<br/><br/>Hanging out in a mall, the film defied my expectations again. Juno spots Vanessa shopping with some friends who happen to have children of their own. Juno curiously looks on, watching this woman interact with kids. No doubt hoping to get a hint of how Vanessa will treat her baby. Every moment we've seen Vanessa, we've seen only a presentation, a façade which is inherently suspicious. Through Mark, we've seen signs of Vanessa's imperfections and hints to her tyrannical reign over his life. But now Juno can see her outside of the meticulously constructed illusion. Now Juno can observe who Vanessa really is.<br/><br/>I honestly expected to see a cruel woman with no patience, an evil control freak who makes kids screech with misery when they don't abide by her will. As Juno watches, though, we see a woman radiating with affection, and we realize that Vanessa's misguided efforts to paint a perfect household were the work of a woman who truly believes she was born to be a mom. A woman desperate for motherhood. She'll make mistakes, but she'll learn from them. She's a woman who will give this thing her all.<br/><br/>The plot eventually brings Juno and Mark together in a scene where conversation leads from comic books to music and they wind up slow dancing to a song played at Mark's prom. And I thought to myself, ""You know, in a lesser movie Vanesse would walk in on these two, see them in each other's arms, and interpret it as something it's not."" <br/><br/>She didn't."
"jelley89","8","0","2","2 August 2008"," the better 'up the duff' based comedy of 2007?
","Now all the Oscar haze surrounding this 'sleeper-hit comedy of the year' has finally settled, a clearer picture of Juno has finally come into view. And unfortunately it doesn't seem to be as flawless as those that sung its praises from the highest rooftops claimed it to be. Critics, more than anything, love to try and champion a trendy indie flick, whipping up mainstream attention. And Juno, the story of a mid-teen, having fallen pregnant seeks a couple to adopt her newborn, is no different.<br/><br/>The drawback to all this attention is it creates a manufactured hype for a movie that will never manage to live up to it. Scribed by stripper-cum-blogger-cum-screenwriter Diablo Cody, is admittedly a refreshingly original take on a premise that has all the potential to be crushingly dull in the wrong hands. However, her lack of experience sometimes shows in the somewhat wafer-thin plotting. <br/><br/>Moreover, the eponymous adolescent, if believed, is the smartest 16 year-old this side of a child prodigy. Admittedly a finely observed performance by Ellen Page, she is crammed with quips that tumble out of her mouth every other line, which becomes tiresome after the first hour. This, coupled with the fact she, along with her parents, seem to think accidentally falling pregnant after a bout of clumsy sex is slightly mundane, and can be concluded with a witty remark (""I am for shizz up the spout"").<br/><br/>Even more troubling for this film, it was released to a post Knocked Up audience. So, was Tinseltown really big enough for two 'bun-in-the-oven' based comedies in 2007? Maybe, but we will never really know as it would be hard, and very nearly a falsehood, to brand Juno an out-an-out comedy. Compared to its obvious bedfellow, which rolled off the Judd Apatow production line last summer, it contains a surprisingly sparse amount of knee-slappers. As mentioned, it has more intelligent wisecracking than you can shake a stick at, but contains not one solitary sure-fire belly laugh.<br/><br/>And this is its fundamental problem over all others. Seth Rogan et al mange to strike the balance between quotable one line zingers, gross out visual gags, whilst still maintaining a thumping heart at its core. Juno, while still possessing an emotional string to its bow, does not manage to play with it way into the third act. By which time it has long since forgotten to be funny. This could, in part, have something to do with the painfully underused new comic talent, Superbad's Michael Cera. Although he is playing more of the straight man here, he manages to be just a blur over the short running time.<br/><br/>However, to ignore the highs of this film would be doing it a complete disservice. As mentioned, the star and supporting cast all submit very watchable performances. Arrested Development's Jason Bateman puts in an incredibly good performance as the wary father to be. But more importantly, the film, although having somewhat of an identity crisis, has a hugely heart-warming feel to it, contributed not least because of the light, whimsical soundtrack.<br/><br/>Adam Jelley"

","Coming from a guy's point of view, this is a mature, more adult version of Napoleon Dynamite mixed with a less-sexed out Superbad. It's not that bad, kinda girly at moments and uncomfortable with women.<br/><br/>I watched this with my girlfriend, and it has a charming story of a real serious situation amongst high school pregnancy. It's real light, some dialogue is comical, but the overall message is still there. Ellen Page is a fresh new face and so delightful taking on a remarkable, well played leading role as Juno MacDuff. I do admit, it's slightly over-hyped, because it's not a movie you absolutely have to see. Myself, I rented it with nothing to do and I enjoyed it.

Juno is as pathetic as Tim McVeigh. She feels so inadequate that she feels its pointless waiting to have anyone marry her. Why bother to have an abortion, if she's inadequate to raise a child LATER? She might as well pass on her genetic baggage and let someone else, anyone else, raise her child. Juno self-sabotages, because of her O self-esteem---not only that, she does all the ""work"" of planning what to do with the child, and ""entertains"" all the adults around her with her patter---without a tear, she wants a CLOSED adoption. Her life is closed---already---by her own mother. If her own mother didn't want her, why would her baby ever want her? Juno also doesn't exist enough to have the choice of abortion. She wants to get the whole thing over with, and never feel good about it---she doesn't see the kid, because only another woman deserves to see it. She takes no pride in her sexuality, her looks, or her clothes. Juno dresses as a boy, holds a pipe, strums a guitar, watches gore films and cracks jokes not to be boyish or mannish, but simply to disappear as a girl/woman."

It was interesting to see him in such a different role.<br/><br/>I really liked the pro-life message of the movie, though I strongly disagree with Juno's and Bleeker's actions leading up to that situation in the first place. So I'm glad to see they made the best of a bad situation, teaching viewers a good message.<br/><br/>What I did not like about the film is the character played by Jason Bateman. This character underlines a serious problem in Hollywood, which is the glamorization of divorce and the trivialization of the sanctity of marriage. He and his wife were dreaming of having a kid, and Juno's situation was an answer to their prayers. Then, on the eve of the adoption, Jason Bateman turns into a chicken and decides to leave his wife, delivering her a crushing blow. He the proceeds to divorce her and leave her all alone to face this adoption that they were originally reaming about together. I wanted to punch that smug look off his face when they were sitting at the dining room table talking about it. In my opinion, he is a coward, and he is not a man. His heart is black to be able to do something like that. Marriage is a sacred, lifelong commitment, not a high school dating relationship that can just be turned off when you get scared of the future. And for that, I knock this movie down a few points. But thumbs up for everything else about it. Highly entertaining, funny, good pace, amusing conversation, and likable characters. The music and music discussion was enjoyable as well.<br/><br/>See my profile for my rating philosophy."

","So much to like about the movie, mostly about Juno (the actress and her lines). And yet, a couple small things: <br/><br/>1) It was just silly for the movie to suggest that Juno could give away her baby....without any sign-off by the father. It was his baby, too, something the ""lawyer' surely would have known.<br/><br/>2) Speaking of the boyfriend, the movie was awfully short of details as to what kind of relationship he had with Juno when they had sex. Just friends? Boyfriend - girlfriend? <br/><br/>3) For a young man who seemed really nice and fairly mature, he sure was uninvolved in the baby. He took a rather extreme ""it's your problem"" approach. If he'd been a jerk, that would have sold, but he wasn't. <br/><br/>4) Course, Juno's parents were pretty uninvolved, too. Their reaction was more appropriate to Juno telling them she'd flunked a class and had to take a summer school course. ""Ok, well, take care of it,"" was the parent's approach. <br/><br/>5) the big issue in the movie was 'what was Juno going to do with the baby?"" Her first choice was abortion. So she goes to the clinic...and walks out in 5 minutes. A life changing change of mind. And just what caused the change? An obnoxious receptionist? Some lady drumming her fingers? It wasn't made clear. The change of mind would have been more convincing if it was more rational."
"editor-131","7","0","5","23 April 2008"," From out of the mouths of babes having babies ... improbable wit
","David Edelstein, film critic for New York magazine and NPR's ""Fresh Air,"" had issues with ""Juno,"" but then, he called Jason Reitman's earlier directorial debut an ""ugly"" adaptation of the book about the lobbying game, Thank You For Smoking. (My problem with that film was that, as a comedy, it didn't quite uglify its subject enoughAaron Eckhart was too likable, and he never truly distances himself from hypocrisy and venal service to greedy interests, even as he professes to be trying to give his son some moral compass.) <br/><br/>We agree that the dialogue in this latest effort, especially the titular lead Juno's (Ellen Page), gratesbut for different reasons. Edelstein likens it to ""bad Neil Simon,"" with bad throwaway jokes litteringculminatingeach scene. There is some similarity to Simon's staginess, in that the dialogue here is speechy and unerringly witty. The real problem is that, as clever and amusing as it all is (especially Juno's lines), no actual 16-year-old talks like that. (Except my own teen-age daughter, and, probably, a 20-year-old too-smart-for-her own-good young woman I recently met, who's probably been a wise-ass impervious to any views but her own for at least four years ...) And, if one does, I think she qualifies to be a legitimate romantic interest of an older man (or at least, an ""inappropriate"" buddy), as turns out here with Jason Bateman's character Mark, the henpecked half of the couple who are adopting Juno's budding offspring.<br/><br/>This film is hard not to like, as Page is both sassy and endearing, with a genuineness the false-sounding lines can't fully obscure. But it's hard to cheer for the ending, where over-controlling Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) is set to raise the baby but without a husband by her side representing sanity, humor and offbeat balance. And, in a phenomenon remarked on in this space before, Juno, like many women, is her own worst enemyassuming, out of whatever insecurities, that the boy she used for first-time sex didn't want an ongoing relationship. Edelstein worries that, especially with the likely popularity of this film with the 'tween girl demographic, we're about to get a society based on a whole generation of Junos. I don't blame him in his concern, but he's a little late: It's already in the works.

And hell, so is the dialogue itself - if the Marx Brothers can do it, why can't Diablo Cody? And as long as you're being witty, who cares how your movie reads as allegory? Unfortunately, that 'as long' comes to a jarring halt when the adopting parents' marital issues go public, in the process defanging this charmer the way Louis B. Mayer neutered Harpo. You could imagine an insightful movie about aging counterculture types clinging to their youthful rebellion as a matter of stunted emotional growth instead of principle, but why get all serious about it? That's what sitcoms do. Why not make your points through the comedy that we came for??

","I can't praise ""Juno"" any more eloquently than its myriad supporters have already done, so instead I will try to counter some of the criticisms of the script that have arisen. By providing a direct counterpoint to some of that negative criticism, I hope to expose prospective viewers to both sides of the script argument, and, hopefully, allow them to watch the film objectively, without any preconceived opinions.<br/><br/>The script by Diablo Cody has a tendency to rub people the wrong way due to the frequent cultural references and general extravagance of the dialogue. Because of these factors, a common complaint is that the dialogue sounds contrived--an argument I feel is only valid for the first fifteen minutes of the film, after which I felt the dialogue became very fluid and natural. For example, in an early scene, Juno rebukes the cashier by saying, ""Silencio, old man!"" This sounds contrived and forced; she is aware that she isn't speaking like a normal person. Later on, however, when she is angry at Mark, she doesn't say ""Silencio, old man!"" or anything remotely similar. She says, ""You guys are supposed to take care of this . . . I want things to be perfect.""<br/><br/>This transition from forced cleverness to genuine humanity is so gradual I had to watch the film a few times before realizing that it is very much intentional. Watching the film is like meeting Juno herself for the first time--a little jarring and uncomfortable at first, but as she gradually lets down her smart-mouthed facade, you grow to love the person inside."

A lot of people will tell you, if you haven't seen this film, that it promotes pregnancy, that its unrealistic, or whatever. This thing with that is though. Its an independent film even though some deny it, it is! And with independent films you can really only enjoy them because you want to see them for their meaning and try to understand where they are coming from. And i can bet 90% of people who went to see this movie went and saw it because it was ""the number one comedy in America"". Yeah its funny but you have to understand the odd humor Diablo Cody is coming from. Its not an average comedy its a comedy that deals with something every one finds ohhh so sensitive and thats teens getting pregnant. And i can tell you Juno doesn't promote that. It shows a mature out look on how the situation should be handled. And as for it being unrealistic, thats not true either. Its just uncommon. But if people hadn't noticed the whole family was a little uncommon. I say see this movie but don't expect your normal happy funny ass comedy. Its little bit different than that."

","Considering the reviews, the 8+ in IMDb ratings and the Oscar from the academy, I expected a lot of good from Juno. After seeing it, well it's not a bad movie but I've gone rather deceived about it.<br/><br/>The strongest point in this movie is how the story flies from clichés; a teenage girl's pregnancy is carried naturally by everybody, and with no drama at all. The script is nice and funny, but I would not say worthy of an Oscar.<br/><br/>The weakest point is how the story goes and ends. It is sweet, predictable, 100% ""a la Hollywood"". Absolutely politically correct. It could have derived in many interesting ways, but it did not. So it give us really very little surprise, controversy or anything that you could expect from an flick that we want to call as ""interesting"". Also a mention to the soundtrack; some people could think that it is ""beautifully minimalistic"", to me it is just a handful of poorly arranged Joan Baez-style songs made of four guitar chords. Actually, very poor stuff that adds little to the movie.<br/><br/>Of course that conservative audiences, secondary school students (who liked American Pie and so), young mothers and people-who-lived-a-similar-experience-or-know-someone-who-did, will mostly love this movie. But sure these points of view will not be based on cinematographic arguments.<br/><br/>Anyway it's still entertaining, funny, and sweet. So it is not bad at all. But probably you won't find a reason for watching it again.<br/><br/>I give it a 6/10"

","I just ended watching Juno. And oh, boys, while I haven't knocked up a single girl in my whole life, I have things to say. Ellen Page (X-Men 3) plays 16 year old Juno, who just got pregnant in a sort of seductive accident by 16 year old yet 3 years mentally old Paulie Bleeker (Micahel Cera) With a sense of simplicity, comedy and irony from the very beginning, Juno is a character, that faces a very hard and human crisis, covering it with a hilarious and ingenious ""cool like sense"" With the help from her best friend, she eventually tells his dad (J.K Simons) and her step mom, and the final choice is to give what she calls ""the thing"" in adoption. The chosen ones are a type family, a cool 70's wanna be rock-star is the dad, and a neurotic mom, Desperate Housewife like is the mom, greatly played by Jennifer Garner. Juno is, along with The Graduate and The Wonder Years TV series, one of those that will give nostalgia later, and gives truth today. 8/10"
"masvillareal","7","0","5","16 February 2008"," not THAT good
","Well, I really wanted to watch this movie because of the good comments and the Oscar nominations, but I must say I ended up a bit disappointed. I think this is a good movie, with a great acting, a nice story and a good soundtrack, but I don't think it's good enough to deserve the nominations for best movie and direction (I would give it to Sweeney Todd instead).<br/><br/>Ellen Page did a very good acting, and I'm sure that she will become a well known actress, but I don't think that she will win the Best Actress Oscar.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, a nice movie to watch if you don't expect a masterpiece (because if you do, you will probably feel disappointed)."
"LazySod","9","0","3","15 February 2008"," Stands up to the comparison with Knocked Up
","When I saw the posters for this film I was thinking this was going to be a teenager version of Knocked Up - some humor, some drama, and eventually a rather Disney end of a story: everything ends up flawlessly well. Maybe it was going to be a little bit moralistic because the pregnancy happened with a child instead of a young adult.<br/><br/>When I finally got to see the film I was happily surprised. One, it's a lot more serious than Knocked Up, it's a bit moralistic, but only a bit and never ""in your face"" and its choice of characters is just brilliant. Juno is the perfect alternative girl next door and Ellen Page (who I also loved in Hard Candy) is able to carry her through per pregnancy with a vivid flair that's almost too real, as if she actually is the girl.<br/><br/>The film deals with the serious aspects of a teen pregnancy as well as the parents of the young mother and the way they have to deal with this new situation. It also deals with the father of the child and all things are worked out equally well, making this a very enjoyable watch.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 pregnancies too early"
"juniorsinspections","9","0","4","15 February 2008"," The best dialog since Pulp Fiction!
","Wow! Let me start by saying that I was blown away by this movie. I went to see it on Valentine's Day because my girlfriend had to work that night and, although I now know Juno is a movie that we would have greatly enjoyed together, I am glad I went to see it alone. This allowed me to really relate to Jason Bateman's character, Mark, and bond with him. Perhaps I bonded too well with Mark and that is why I am only rating this movie a 9-out-of-10? In fact, the only criticism I have about Juno is that Mark is so likable that we (men) want to give him a pass and overlook the fact that he makes a move on a minor that is less than half his age. Other than that, I think the dialog is some of the best that's ever come out of a film, the characters were all unique and interesting, and this film made you believe that there is nothing wrong with life in a small town and that we should always love whom we choose to love and for our own reasons."
"mamaramseys","5","0","4","10 February 2008"," They turned to right page when casting Ellen Page for the role of Juno!!!
","It's true. I must say she is very gifted in her acting abilities. I was so entertained by her character in the movie that I almost fell in love with her literally even though she isn't that fly plus she's a midget. But nevertheless she was a pro and that's all that matters, and kinda cute when she opens up her big mouth. One thing that still humors me though is the class those two kids belonged in in high school terms -- ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS!!! Overall I'd like to put the average label on it. It was sincere of her to actually give her son up to a couple who could love him and nurture him rather than terminate the pregnancy. I just wish a more older and mature director committed to this endeavor. This was a serious topic here!!! At the same time however I'll have to hand it to Reitman's ability to blend in the humor with it and the music.... well that was probably the only part of the movie I did not like"
"bigben5","6","0","5","3 February 2008"," Like a breath of fresh air....sort of
","I saw this movie last week and thought it was excellent. Now I'm starting to wonder why I liked it so much.<br/><br/>The premise of the story (as we all know) is this: 16-year-old Juno McGuff gets pregnant and gives the baby away. There really isn't that much plot to it. In fact, your average Spot book has more plot than there is to be found in this movie. What really makes Juno unique however, is the approach with which they deal with the subject matter.<br/><br/>In the real world Juno would probably have been disowned, had an abortion, or committed suicide. But instead she is portrayed as a brash, disgusting, overconfident tomboy, with a Gung-ho attitude about everything. Her parents are surprisingly supportive and there are just a lot of cultural issues (such as abortion clinics, condoms, and drugs) to poke fun at.<br/><br/>Here's what I didn't like about the movie: <br/><br/><ul><li>The joke with the boys in their short shorts got lame pretty quickly.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Paulie Bleaker character doesn't do anything to own up for what he did to Juno. Sure, I know he doesn't have much confidence to begin with, but it sure makes for a weak and unlikeable character. Juno ends up having to do everything.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>And that love song at the end destroyed my suspension of disbelief. In what was already a whimsical and zany world, I find it difficult to find two lovers (er, kids) singing love songs simultaneously to one another. Did we really have to sit through the full two minutes of it?</li></ul><br/><br/>Bottom line: This is probably the most original movie I have seen in a long while, offering one of the most memorable characters in ages. It's freshness is akin to eating a piece of moldy bread and liking it because of the flavor."
"TonesH","6","0","6","27 January 2008"," A very good teen pregnancy movie
","I think that when it comes to teenage dramas Ellen Page is the best person to make it interesting for a very wide audience. She has such a knack for quirky, strong, witty characters. The real joy of this movie was seeing all of the characters, likable in their own rights, snapping out this great dialogue. The father particularly was fantastic, but I have to say Michael Cera may be the Mark Hamil of our generation, having only that bemused smile look.<br/><br/>I have to see that this was a really interesting interpretation of the teen pregnancy scenario. Although most of the situations that the characters encounter are fairly typical of such movies, I think that all of the character's interesting reactions keep one engaged throughout.<br/><br/>Having said this, I'm not entirely sure this film justifies being in the top 250. Though very good, with great performances, I was a little bored by the end. There's only so much witty dialogue I can stand before it loses a bit of punch, even when realism isn't a particular concern. Ultimately this is a teen movie, but still a very likable one."
"blanbrn","9","0","9","21 January 2008"," Eggo your pregnant! Witty and sassy and intelligent teen flick, in which a girl learns the facts of life to become happy!
","It appears once again that FOX Searchlight pictures has found another winner in this indie as you may be like me and consider it similar to ""Little Miss Sunshine"" for the fact of it's central character is again a sassy and adorable female, yet both films are similar with coming of age tales of life. ""Juno"" is well written and very funny and most of the lines said from Ellen Page's Juno character are very witty and sassy with an intelligence that's so uncommon from a teenage girl. ""Juno"" also proves that life has it's growing pains with unexpected bumps and curves happen along the way before love and happiness is realized.<br/><br/>Ellen Page is fantastic in her performance of teenage girl Juno MacGuff a small town Minnesota girl who's a rock n' roll fan and slurp drinker who's equipped with a sharp and witty vocabulary that's bright and sassy, Juno always is a lighting rod of intelligence! So when Juno discovers she's pregnant from a one night stand and first sexual experience romp with boyfriend Paulie Bleeker(Michael Cera)a shy and boring yet successful cross country running track star she must think up of a plan to do! At first it appears the easy way out is to have an abortion. Juno then realizes a better solution give the child away when born to a successful and head straight couple. Enter Vanessa and Mark Loring who are played very sharp and beautifully by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman respectively.<br/><br/>Soon little by little and when seasons change Juno begins her journey with each bump and trimester of getting to know and socialize more with the adoptive parents to be. Yet along the way as in life so many times unexpected road bumps and curves come up to throw your plan off. As Juno will find from the couple a spoil is in the works. Also during the time we see a young woman who has became at ease with herself and grown up to discover in the end her true love in Bleeker. As for the plan it ended a little different only half of the couple found parenthood, as the saying goes a gain of love for one a loss for the other.<br/><br/>As we see in the film though as Juno gives life to a happy Vanessa most important of all Juno has grown to give her life new meaning by growing up and finding what she wanted with love and learned how to make decisions. ""Juno"" is an excellent film even though it's a teen drama flick it's touching and it's about giving and taking and learning to grow up. The film also has a common everyday feel to it making it good. Plus the performance from Ellen Page is very intelligent, sassy, smart and over the top she's a real winner with a bright future. Also TV veterans J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney were tough and compassion felt as a loving father and straight up stepmother respectively. ""Juno"" is one feel good and sassy fun intelligent film to watch."
"juliehub","10","0","4","6 January 2008"," Julie's love of every character and the movie
","Bleeker is hilarious him actually trying hard to be cool and his obsession with tic tacs!! OMG totally can relate but the movie was amazing! If I could have that sense of humor that Ellen page had... and that acceptance of life like she did... I would also be pretty awesome. Jennifer Garner you could kinda tell at the end she looked a little on the pregnant side... but her character was soooo bizarre. If everyone had a mother like her we would all be a little bit on the weirder side of life. I hope one day in my life I could meet Ellen Page and just tell her how much I look up to her after this movie. And that what she believes in, in real life makes me wanna be an actress. An that I am just a tomboy like her. If i could meet them i would hug them!! And ask Bleeker to sing a song for me. :D<br/><br/>Junoverse ID-3566"
