"jaredpahl","4","9","9","13 July 2016"," Drifting Further Away From The Charm Of The Original
","The Ice Age series is one of the more endearing animated franchise from the past decade. The first was a heartwarming and genuinely funny adventure taking place during the time of mammoths, sabertooth tigers, and clumsy sloths. The first sequel lost a lot of that magic, but Dawn of the Dinosaurs did do some fresh things with the series. However, generally, over time, the films have gained plenty of characters, but lost most of its charm. The fourth in the series, Continental Drift, is the least exciting, least funny, and cheapest of the bunch. That's not to say that Ice Age 4 doesn't have its moments: the main characters still have their appeal and there are a few good laughs, but it is clear that the Ice Age train is running out of steam here.<br/><br/>Continental Drift kicks off with the lovable rodent Scrat causing the continents to drift apart. The trio of Manny, Diego, and Sid are soon embarking on an adventure adrift on the open sea. They meet up with pirates (and a whole collection of new characters) and try to find their way home. The plots of the Ice Age films have gotten simpler as they go, instead relying on introducing as many new characters as possible.<br/><br/>The problem with Ice Age 4 is that none of the new characters are memorable, funny, or charming. The effort just seems to be down here. Ray Romano, Dennis Leary, and John Leguizamo, still manage to breath some life into the picture, but the passion is clearly not there like it was in 2002. The animation is also less-than-stellar. Ice Age Continental Drift could be a TV movie and I wouldn't know the difference. It's just cheap.<br/><br/>There are some moments of wit and excitement in Ice Age 4, but on the whole, it is an exercise in diminishing returns. Most of the passion and effort of the series is gone, leading to a generic and, dare I say, boring animated adventure. Look elsewhere for family fun.<br/><br/>42/100"
"sarahbonmariage","6","112","145","26 June 2012"," Sometimes hilarious yet disappointing ...
","For years I have been a huge fan of the Ice Age series and had been expecting this new movie for months! Needless to say I was counting the days until the release of the movie and the hilarious teasers were really making the waiting difficult ... <br/><br/>I saw it tonight and have to admit that I feel really disappointed ... Was I expecting too much ? We were a group of young adults who grew up with the movies, or at least liked them a lot and we felt let down. The storyline feels a little weak, I thought there would be a lot of adventure and action, as in the 3 previous ones where you don't see how time flies ... This one, if not boring, is too simple, not to mention incredibly predictable. There is no twists and turns. When you think about the first episode, yes, you realize how poor the scenario is in this new one. <br/><br/>I admit there's been a real effort to create an original story that might bring the characters in another world and make them live another adventure, different from the previous ones. I think this part is a total failure. Not to mention the ""song"" they put in the movie, it was nothing but ridiculous and irrelevant, especially for a movie series as famous as Ice Age. I thought it was unnecessary. <br/><br/>But since I laughed a few times and feel really bad about writing such a ""negative"" review, I have to admit that some of the scenes were absolutely hilarious and the characters have been kept as funny as they used to be, especially Sid (and his incredible grandmother). It's just a pity that the funny parts are so negligible ... You smile a lot, you laugh sometimes, but certainly not during the whole movie.<br/><br/>Maybe I am too old to appreciate this movie as I should have, as I'm sure the kids will love it and the movie will have a lot of success this summer. I don't wish it the contrary, I just watched it with my not-so-kid-anymore-but-very-nostalgic-eyes and went out of the theater with the feeling that something from before was clearly missing ..."
"me31212644","4","37","48","15 July 2012"," Ice Age 1-2-3 were better......Number 4.... yikes!
","It still feels like yesterday when i saw the first Ice Age in theaters, at first i thought it was just a typical kids movie made to entertain kids only leaving adults bored. But after watching the movie, i laughed so hard my blood pressure rose and i just fell in love with the series throughout my childhood! Anytime a new Ice Age was released in theaters, we had to watch it first before any other movie. No matter what was in the film i have always givin a 10/10 for the funny moments.<br/><br/>When Ice age 3 came around, i thought it was going to be the best and the last .. well it was very very good but it wasn't the last. I thought it was the last film because how Buck chose to stay below :( and Scrats new girlfriend Scratte stayed below ground too and how the ending credits was set up.<br/><br/>And now.... here comes Ice Age 4, yay!... not. Anyhoo, i went and saw ice age 4 today getting excited and all. What a drag it was, If you remember watching ice age 1-2-3 and loved how the herd was still the same as they were just the fantastic trio. Well, in number 4, it doesn't seem like an Ice Age to me because of the too many new characters and the unnecessary teenage drama with Ethan, Steffie, and Peaches. It was cool how they added pirates and a girl for Diego (it was about time for that) but the character development was bad.<br/><br/>Remember Crash and Eddie? they was only shown in four scenes out of the whole movie. Ellie wasn't in it much either, nor was Shira! I mainly blame this movie because of the horrible teenage drama, lack of character development, too many unnecessary new characters, and last but not least, drama queens the horrible trios (steffie, Ethan, Megan) being part of the herd instead of the good ones like Buck, Fast Tony, Scratte, and the baby, the classic ones that deserved to be. Not these screw ups.<br/><br/>I feel terrible that this is the first time i gave Ice Age a negative review, but to me, it was the truth. This movie was the worst of the bunch.<br/><br/>Hopefully Ice Age 5 will be better. I hope they bring back all of our favorite characters from the past that we've come to love during the first three adventures, but it seems that the new horrible trios are going to reappear once again to ruin it.(you know who im talking about)"
"lagudafuad","6","31","40","6 July 2012"," it was fun, but not the best of the series
","Ice Age: Continental Drift is funny, and i had fun watching it and looked forward to seeing what this weird herd is up to now.<br/><br/>It is the fourth installment of the Ice Age series and the seventh CG production of Blue Sky Studios and the first sequel not to be directed by Carlos Saldanha who will be directing RIO part 2.<br/><br/>What I love must about this flick is the introduction of a partner for Diego; a white tiger lady is added ladies and gentlemen. The movie also has the whole fun of the old clichés, which I seem not to be tired of seeing. It also showcases cool CG effect; I loved the water effect most.<br/><br/>The plot was educational (as long as you know it is bogus) due to Scrat's (Squirrel) hunt for acorns he triggers the break-up of the world continent into the continents as we know them today, which cause Manny to lose his family.<br/><br/>Manny, Diego, and Sid embark upon another adventure to find his family, after their continent is set adrift. Using an iceberg as a ship, they encounter sea creatures and battle pirates as they explore a new world, and learn why it is good to be part of a family herd, than being part of a group where one person leads and other follow.<br/><br/>Well, the new directors weren't that bad, as the movie did have some fun screenplays and events that you will be thrilled to see. As we watch this creatures move from the Ice Age to the present age the pictures tell stories that are kinda informative and entertaining.<br/><br/>Hey! I must have missed that geography class when they taught that Scrat the squirrel created the whole world.<br/><br/>Although this is not the best addition to the Ice Age series it was fun to watch. And the movie kinda opens doors to new additional sequels.<br/><br/>But I hope Blue Sky won't bother making any more."
"quinnaj","7","51","74","24 June 2012"," I enjoyed it
","Attended a packed preview screening yesterday (the film opens here next Thursday)with my wife and 6 year old daughter and must say that if you liked the previous Ice Ages then this one will not disappoint. Kids loved it and plenty there for the adults to relate to and enjoy as well. Animation quality(in 2D)was top notch and story line was good and with plenty of humour and action a plenty. A few of the subplots were educational as well as exploring the values of friendship,loyalty and the like which is probably standard fare for these types of films. As a 47 year old bloke I enjoyed it and would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone but especially for the target audience of young families you can't go wrong."
"Troy_Campbell","7","35","49","1 July 2012"," Fun for the whole family.
","Although not regarded in the same league as the Pixar and Disney output, the initial three Ice Age instalments collected over $2bn at the worldwide box office. (Rather surprisingly, that's $100m more than the Toy Story trilogy earned.) Posting figures as huge as that means we get treated to another adventure with mammoth Manny (Ray Romano), sabre-tooth tiger Diego (Denis Leary) and silly sloth Sid (John Leguizamo); this time with pirates. Like each episode before it, Ice Age 4 prides itself in offering up goofy laughs and goofier characters, with the ragtag bunch of pirates – led by Peter Dinklage's droll Captain Gutt and assisted by Nick Frost's uproarious elephant seal Flynn – the source of much joy. The old gang don't dissatisfy either: Sid is the standout as usual but Diego gets more laughs than normal and Scrat's little journey is ever-amusing. The serious Manny is still, well, the serious Manny, but you can't win them all. The bucket load of action remains too, however nothing here tops the dinosaur rumbling in part three. Continental Drift is gratifying escapism for the whole family that, despite being the fourth outing for these prehistoric creatures, shows few signs of letting up."
"ashfox","6","5","5","10 November 2012"," Entertaining, but not so much as before
","I have always liked the Ice Age series up to the third one. In fact, this is the first time that I thought I would watch it in theater rather than getting a DVD later. The 3D was spectacular in terms of visual appearance, but I would not rate it as good as the previous Ice Age movies.<br/><br/>The plot during this adventure is short and simple. There's no surprises, and everything is pretty much along the line of a typical friendship/family/hero type story. The whole story took place in 3, 4 ""in-movie"" days, much shorter than the previous ones which had a constant string of events. By the end of this movie, I couldn't believe the story's over. Not a lot happened before the villains are apprehended and the world returns to peace and harmony, as in any of the Ice Age movies. However, this probably means their target audience are younger than the ones before. I guess this is the biggest drag down for fans who have been watching since the first one.<br/><br/>They also did a sub-par job in the music. Despite having no improvement in quality, they recycled music from the second movie in the series, ""the Meltdown"". I bought the soundtracks after watching that movie thinking it was spectacular. After listening to it for years now, I could virtually name the tracks as they come up in the Continental Drift. From the title sequence to the Ending, pretty much everything without a vocal voice was identical to something I've heard before. It feels like they just copied and pasted from before - The soundtracks are awesome, but when it's used once too many, it just doesn't have the same impact anymore.<br/><br/>I still gave this movie a 6 because of, well, what Fox and Blue Sky has always been best at. The vivid colors and the ""just right"" graphical presentation is sure a feast on the eyes. And don't forget about Scrat, who's never involved but just somehow miraculously leads the story. This movie is definitely great for fun, there are many (supposedly deliberate) punch lines. Although some puns fail when I go ""huh? that's lame"", I can feel that they are trying to make it as funny as possible. I'd say that they are making this movie more like a feature-length, high quality TV cartoon special rather than a real theatrical movie. There's just not that much thrill to it.<br/><br/>The addition of the new characters seems only to provide a villain to the storyline. There doesn't seem to be much careful consideration - from what I see, it's perfectly fine to replace any of them with another animal or personality and the story stays valid. The characters' specialties just do not come together and contribute to the story, another reason why it feels like the story was written without the context of the movie. Not even the prolonged characters like Manny, Diego, Sid and Peaches.<br/><br/>Bottom line: This movie is mediocre. It could do as a really nice cartoon, but it lacks the punch in the planning."
"xboy614","7","25","36","5 July 2012"," Ice Age 4-A worthy sequel
","I loved Ice Age the first one to death when I first watched it. I own it and every once and awhile I go to my DVD cupboard and pick it up and watch it. I disliked the sequel, Ice Age: Meltdown. The second sequel i hated too. They added new characters and I missed the chemistry and the funny lines that happened between just Sid the sloth, Manny and Diego the sabre tooth tiger. They added new characters which were sometimes funny but I missed the same three from the first one. In this third sequel the team must have realized this by splitting Sid, Manny and Diego with Sid's funny, odd grandma sloth away from the others on a race to get back to the herd and to get rid of these pirates. The pirates are entertaining as ever and very funny, the monkey played by Peter Dinklage is really good and the main plot flies along at a terrific pace. The jokes are fresh (most of them) and funny and you can't help liking this film. The side plots can get a bit cliché but I ignored them."
"apb216","8","4","4","13 June 2013"," Keeps getting better!
","Obviously, the original can never be touched. That being said, people tend to think that the sequels get worse. Nowadays, they aren't stopping at three and Ice Age is no exception. Granted, the released sequels aren't necessarily better, but they aren't bad! As long as you don't take them too seriously, like most people on here do, you can have fun with it and just enjoy the ride. Of the sequels, I enjoyed this one the most. I thought the plot was reasonably realistic and I enjoyed the characters, new and old. The thing that made me giddy with excitement was realizing the captain was played by Peter Dinklage! I am a huge fan of him, being a fan of Game of Thrones, and he played a fantastic villain. In contrast, I am not a fan of Jennifer Lopez by any means and I liked her character as well...that may or may not have anything to do with the fact that I really like white tigers. <br/><br/>It's got laughs, great characters, warm moments, life lessons, and even some mythical creatures! And we get to see a bit more of Scrat...and who doesn't love that silly little squirrel thing? I think this sequel has topped 2 & 3 and is definitely worth watching!"
"DJKwa","8","58","95","24 June 2012"," Keeps the series going strong!
","Fantastic film! As a fan of the series, i was a bit skeptical that they were taking it too far however, if this film is any indication, the series is as strong as ever! You feel comfortable returning to the characters for another adventure and i don't see fans of the series being disappointed. The film is fast and fun and carries excellent messages of the importance of family and the importance of being yourself. A bunch of new characters freshen up the film, with a band of pirates, including a love interest for Diego and Sid is accompanied by his grandmother who is humorously oblivious to the dangerous situations the characters get into. Scrat also gets plenty of time chasing his elusive acorn, with the footage that was released as part of advertisements (Scrat's Continental Crack-Up)comprising in the film. However, there is also a hilarious scene at the end where he finally reaches the treasure island that the map on the acorn (seen in the advertisements) leads to. <br/><br/>A great, fun, family film that boasts crisp and detailed animation that actually makes great use of 3D. Definitely recommended! <br/><br/>*The short film that precedes the film, 'The Longest Daycare'- a Simpsons short, is a pleasant addition to the main film. It is a silent short that features Maggie Simpson and Baby Gerald, where Maggie tries to save a butterfly from the daycare from the clutches of the baby. It is clever and fun and it is great to see more films having original shorts like Pixar's fantastic ones."
"sddavis63","4","18","26","15 July 2012"," A Definite Decline In The Series' Quality
","As with most sequels, the quality of the Ice Age movies is definitely regressing. I've enjoyed the others in the series (well, actually, I haven't seen The Meltdown, but I've seen the original and Dawn of the Dinosaurs) but I found Continental Drift to be disappointing in comparison. The animation is good as always, but there's too much in this that's too similar to what we've seen before (and, frankly, Scrat the sabre-toothed squirrel is getting tired and boring; same sub-plot every single time.)<br/><br/>In Continental Drift the original content came across to me as silly and overdone. As the land begins to drift apart (quite suddenly) Manny, Sid and Diego are trapped on a floating block of ice, desperately trying to get back to their ""herd."" Then they spend basically the entire movie fighting a gang of pirates led by a primate named Captain Gutt. This battle goes on and on and on. It makes for a movie that's a little bit (well, a lot) more violent than the other Ice Age movies and while there are some humorous moments (largely revolving around Sid's grandma) it didn't seem to me to have the fun of the other movies in the series that I've seen.<br/><br/>In fairness, my daughter's 8. She says she liked it. I can't disagree with that, so if the target audience is kids, then this is OK. It's just that the previous Ice Age movies seemed to have something for people of all ages to enjoy. This one was lacking that. (4/10)"
"cattjones","4","48","79","15 July 2012"," Should have stopped at 3
","Question: How many top entertainers does it take to make an animated film? Answer: Apparently a whole slew of them. I guess the directors of this film thought that the more celebrities, the better the film would be. Not!! But I guess it did make for a pretty decent paycheck. Compared to other animated films of the summer, this one lacks in originality and freshness. I think the lessons that were trying to be conveyed in this film was a little too complicated for the very young crowd that was in the theater with me. The parts of the film that got the most laughs were every time the spotlight was put on Scrat (Chris Wedge). Even in the Ice Age predecessors, he was always the funniest. Maybe it is time for Scrat to get his own film. The young audience did not need dialog they just wanted to laugh. The other character that drew a lot of giggles was Sid (John Leguizamo). Sid along with Granny (Wanda Sykes) was a comedic match made in heaven. I saw an interview that Wanda did and initially she wanted to change her voice to sound older, but the director told her that her voice was perfect for the part. I think that she got a chuckle out of that. I do want to mention Peter Dinklage (Captain Gutt). He seems to be getting a lot of attention since he won a SAG and an Oscar for his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister in Game of Thrones. I have to say that by the end of the film I grew a little weary of Captain Gutt. He was really starting to get on my last nerve. Peaches (Keke Palmer) was a typical teenager that had to deal with peer pressure, parental rules and misguided decision making. The hate/love relationship that built between Diego (Denis Leary) and Shira (Jennifer Lopez) did manage to give the film a little extra punch, but not much. The film wasn't all bad. There were a few laughs; however this franchise has been saturated. I definitely think that it is time to put this one to bed. I think that very young viewers will appreciate the animation and maybe pre-teens will get the message, but this film was not designed to do both. All that being said, I am going to have to give this film a mammoth amber light."
"siberiandante","6","22","33","9 July 2012"," A good entry in the series, but not a terrific movie
","Ice Age: Continental Drift is the fourth installment in the Ice Age series, which was started a decade ago by FOX when they tried their hand at animation again after Titan A.E. became a box office bomb. The series follows a group of quite different prehistoric animals and the plot that it follows has been so far a formulaic ""go from point A to B"" story.<br/><br/>As the title suggests, Ice Age 4's plot revolves around the separation of continents. The herd is separated and while the original trio goes into an adventure overseas, the ""half opossum, half mammoth"" family tries to reach a rock bridge to meet up there. The film's animation is fantastic (you could hardly say a mainstream animated movie doesn't have terrific CGI) and backgrounds and water effects are beautiful, but the movie's storytelling is too fast paced and there are too many characters for them to develop while the movie lasts.<br/><br/>If the series is too formulaic what is the appeal of this movie? For anyone who has seen the whole series, you'll be happy to know Diego meets a female saber-tooth on the way and Sid is reunited with his sloth family. Amongst the new characters are a crew of pirates that capture the trio while they explore the ocean and become the main antagonists of the film.<br/><br/>The movie is overall quite worth it to watch with your family, but even the third one (which I didn't like a lot) had a better paced storytelling. New characters, in my opinion, don't really display a lot of personality traits other than Granny Sloth, but it is quite the enjoyable flick I would watch a few times on theaters.<br/><br/>The 3D, by the way, is not really worth it and the movie doesn't make use of it correctly. There were some moments when the background looked it was over the characters and that almost gave me a head ache. If you're taking your family to watch the movie don't waste your money on 3D."
"lothos-370-690020","4","3","3","25 August 2012"," Ran out of ideas
","Lets get this straight, I had low expectations for every single one of these films, but was pleasantly surprised each time by the first three. Not particularly inspired stories, but great script and performances all round. This one felt, almost from the first scene, like the writers had already used every idea they had and none of the actors really wanted to be there. The teenagers were annoying, imagine Sweet Valley High annoying, the new characters were not needed and were so poorly acted, they'd have been better off leaving their scenes blank, and I mean a fews seconds of blank white screen with no sound blank, it was that bad. The only exception was granny, although she was fairly annoying, but at least she was intended to be. The worst part was the idea, lets include some pirates, cause their in fashion. When they first appeared I hoped they were just a quick nod to the genre and move on, but no, they occupied almost the entire second half of the story. In my opinion the first three films were so good because despite the inherent need to add new characters with each new sequel, they centred on the main characters who made the original so successful. Basically put, more Sid, less teenagers."

The first movie was excellent but after that we all know what to expect from Ice Age franchise. And let's be honest so far they have delivered their best.

"Karlamon","6","12","19","8 July 2012"," A flawed but fun addition to the series
","It has been ten years since we saw our Sub-Zero Heros for the first time, and as a long-term Ice Age fan, I have experienced some ups and downs with the series. The first two movies I have really adored, especially the second one for its relaxed story and beautiful animation. But by the time they jumped the shark with the dumb addition of dinosaurs in the third film and the incoherent Christmas special (in which Christmas didn't exist), this made me loose faith in the series. Despite low expectations for this latest addition, I did opt to attend a 3D screening and I was quite surprised about how much fun I had. While Ice Age 4: Continental Drift is quiet enjoyable, its heavily flawed too.<br/><br/>This episode of the highly successful series see's Manny, Diego and Sid separated from the others on a sheet of ice after Scrat the saber-tooth squirrel accidentally causes Pangaea to break up with his acorn (which you've probably seen earlier in Scrat's Continental Crack-up). On the way, they find Sid's granny as a stowaway, discover a new land and come across a bunch of pirates in which Diego falls in love with one of them; a female saber-tooth called Shira. Meanwhile back at home Manny's teenage daughter Peaches finds herself in a relationship conflict with a mammoth named Ethan and a mole hog called Louis, while at the same time having to avoid the disaster caused by Scrat.<br/><br/>Phew! At first impression, this seems like a lot of story to get through in a 94 minute movie. However, the storytelling is all played smoothly, if predictably, but also suffers from a number of unexplained story elements like where did the pirates come from and why they became pirates in the first place. The biggest plot hole has to be the fact that the Pangaea continent Scrat splits up is entirely out of continuity with the Ice Age period since this was meant to happen millions of years prior. Did they makers even do research on this? Couldn't it have just been an simpler approach instead? I found many parts of the film to feel borrowed or rehashed from other animated films, including previous Ice Age films, and with the large amount of story, a few elements aren't focused deep enough including Diego and Shira's relationship.<br/><br/>Despite these issues however, here is a lot to like in this entry. As you would expect from Blue Sky, the animation is very colourful and fluid, the most impressive elements having to be the sea storms as they are well-detailed and thrilling to watch, but it has a been-there-done-that feeling since we are all familiar with the characters and setting. Plus the movie has good use of 3D which isn't too distracting or barely noticeable and I soon forgot that I was wearing the glasses. The humor in this one is pretty hit-and-miss, but when it hits, its quite funny. With the old characters retaining their personalities (which is faithful to them), there's a lot of new characters to freshen things up. While I found Sid's granny a bit annoying at times, I did particularly enjoy Peter Dinklage's evil performance as Captain Gutt as with the other pirates. However my two person favorites were Peaches and Louis because of their character development and nice (if slightly clichéd) friendship, which is something I could relate to, and I thought Josh Gad was a good choice for Louis' sweet and caring personality.<br/><br/>So overall, I'd have to say that Ice Age 4 was a pretty fun ride for me and was much better than I expected despite its problems. Is it great? Well I can't say its as amazing as the first two, but at least its a bit better than the third. I'm glad that I saw it, but I think the series just doesn't feel the same as it was back in 2002. It seems to be missing the nostalgia and charm that the first movie had. And with that said, I suggest its best for Fox to end this saga here instead of continuing to milk and worsen the beloved series. A fifth film is just unnecessary."

","This is in no way like the other three Ice Age movies. It is just plain irritating from beginning to end.

I guess they're trying to appeal to ""minority"" audiences...<br/><br/>Throw in a stupid take-off of Pirates of Penzance, a bored performance by the main characters (although they made Peter Dinklage into a manic monkey), and you get a stew of pain. I guess they decided it's time for minority voices to drown out the white males, and this is the stupidity they come up with.

The intro of the movie is really funny (1 minute), but then you should prepare yourself to enter the empire of boredom. <br/><br/>The storyline is very predictable as well as the characters, even the kids remained silent in the first 40 minutes. <br/><br/>While I simply LOVED the first part of the franchise and I was OK with the 2nd and 3rd, I would recommend the Continental Drift to my enemies only.<br/><br/>Stay away, this cow is milked dry already.<br/><br/>Not recommended at all."

","Scrat has always been a favorite of mine in his short cameos in the other 'Ice Age' movies, it is a nice touch that they made him an ongoing part of the story here.

Somehow he manages to reverse the rotation and that results in splitting off of all the continents, ""a long, long time ago.""<br/><br/>All this causes plate tectonics to shift large sections of the Earth, splitting off families from each other, and most of the story is having them try to find each other again.

"nickmesafilms","4","2","2","4 October 2012"," Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012) - Why is This Franchise Drifting?
","Set as a fourth sequel to the original three Ice Age films, ""Continental Drift"" reunites the memorable characters of Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo), Diego the saber-toothed Tiger (voiced by Denis Leary), and of course, my favorite character, Scrat, the saber-toothed squirrel whose adventures involve him trying to catch his acorn. In this movie, we learn about Pangaea, the continents drifting apart from each other, and we get a little satire, making fun of how Pangaea actually happened. That concept could have led to a fun animated movie that both kids and adults will enjoy. Sadly, I was half-right, it's only for kids! The ""Ice Age"" franchise is starting to lose their gas after releasing that ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" crap, and there was never no need to make a fourth installment. But, too bad, because Hollywood always loves to make money out of these movies. That just proves that the only reason why these movies keep being made is that they make tons of money. Although the first two movies were good, it was until the third movie's release when the series became a cash-obsessed series. I'm starting to feel bad for all those unlucky parents who spent their money, so they can take their kids to go see this. Because although it was trying to be a family film that everybody can enjoy, it just falls flat and becomes this stupid kid movie, filled with such juvenile humor. I understand that the general audience for these movies are young kids, but the least you could have done is to also make this movie fun for the adults, as well, so they won't have to kill themselves once they leave the theater. This is definitely not one of those times. Although there are some funny chuckles to be found in this movie, although doesn't help the movie for the most part, the rather hilarious scenes in the movie come from Scrat, the cute squirrel trying to find his acorns. The rest of the movie, just a chuckle! We also have a collection of celebrities who appear as the voices of new characters, from Nicki Minaj, Drake, Keke Palmer, Jennifer Lopez, Wanda Sykes, and Peter Dinklage. I just can't begin to think that all these celebrities thought this movie would be nothing but an easy paycheck. The plot was beyond ridiculous, most of the jokes were lame as hell, and the horrendously usual movie clichés were everywhere, from Manny as the over-protective father, the rebellious younger daughter wanting to hang out with the cool kids, the pirate villain wanting revenge on the protagonist for no particular reason, and thousands of love triangle story lines. Are you kidding me? This movie is just a forgettable experience that's not even worth talking about. If anybody has a child in their family, they might enjoy this movie, but this movie is strictly for kids, and if you think adults will like the juvenile humor this movie brings, you know it's going to be bad. It's not funny or entertaining, it just drags on for a couple of hours, goes through plenty of weak gags, one after another, until reaching it's predictable conclusion. This is probably one of the most forgettable movies, and one of the worst movies of the year. But it's not that awful, this is a kids' movie, you know! Yeah, I can be nice! ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"", in my review, ""a generic, mediocre, unfunny, and predictable 'kids-fest'""."
"spidyvinay","8","2","2","31 July 2012"," A very nicely done movie: You'll love this if you like animation ones..
","Fox Animation provides another brilliant addition to the sequel in the name of Ice Age 4 Continental Drift. For the previous viewers of the Ice Age, this movie offers you what all you can ask from it. There is the cuteness of a cartoon movie, the wit combined with a light sense of humour which is so lovely to keep the movie lively all along, the sweetness of the romanticism, the valour for the true sense of belongingness, the sensibility of a lovely herd. The saber – Deigo which was alone for a while now finds a partner. So I am imagining the next sequel they make, they may have something in it for Sid.<br/><br/>The movie in itself is a brilliant watch. Cartoon lovers would love the animation in this, it keeps up all the promises it makes for the movie. The introductory scene itself is a brilliant move, the continental drift is shown is such a witty and a humorous way, that very scene got me hooked on to the movie. From then on it was a smooth sailing, the movie gives the witty punches in the right places and the times, the 3D view is brilliant. It certainly is worth watching a cartoon movie in 3D, it enhances the viewing experience to a whole new level, thanks to Tin Tin for introducing us to the 3D in animation..........<br/><br/>The movie revolves around the plot of the continental drift, how the planets split and what happens to the ice. The mammoth Manny is separated from the family and the quest is about Manny getting back to his family. En route, the saber Deigo meets his love who later goes on to join the herd. A new villain is introduced and the concept of a pirate ship is brought out beautifully. The whole setting is brilliant, the screenplay, choreography, all come together to make the viewing experience a very enjoyable one. The movie holds us together for the whole two hours. The entertainment factor is definitely guaranteed. The theatre was almost full at about 2 in the noon on a weekday. So it does manage to draw the crowd consistently.<br/><br/>The movie is cute, sweet and a delight : kids would love it and so would the romantics. It certainly is a good watch. I would rate it at least a 4 on 5. For the choice of movies this week, I would certainly say this one is a must watch.<br/><br/>Vinay Nagaraju http://muktamanassu.wordpress.com/2012/08/01/ice-age-4-continental- drift-movie-review/"
"EmmaDinkins","6","2","2","15 July 2012"," Chix Chat on Film Review: Ice Age with increased star power..
","Ice Age Continental Drift is the fourth film in this animated series that follows the migration of a group of unlikely friends across continents as their lives evolve. Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) now have to contend with a teenage Peaches (Keke Palmer) and just about everything surrounding that relationship and her growth was so cliché. Any and every teenage coming of age story ever written, acted out in a play or on screen was covered in one-liners like 'just be yourself', which we know isn't possible since teenagers typically don't know who they are. This story introduced a number of new characters which most of which we will likely see in the next installment. With the whole teenage scenario came Ethan (Drake) the object of Peaches affection. We finally get a glimpse into the sloth family and have a better understanding of the reason Sid's (John Leguizamo) a sloth apart, this story brought another new character his Granny (Wanda Sykes). As things get adventurous we encounter another group of unlikely companions led by Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) a primate who is just mean for no apparent reason, but his crew included Shira (Jennifer Lopez), who comes with the best storyline. My favorite character of them all for whatever reason is and has always been Diego (Dennis Leary) so to see in the trailers that a female saber is now in the picture led me to hope that he would finally meet his match. As always the animation looks great, even though the stories are very elementary. I tried to stay interested by calling upon my inner child during the viewing but at one point almost dozed off. This could have something to do with just returning home from a Mississippi Gulf vacation that included late nights, but I digress. This film targets young children and during the screening the physical comedy garnered the desired reaction, laughter. There was an entire Ewok adventure that caused some ooos for cuteness, and there was a slightly frightening siren segment that caused some ahhs. The whole opening segment featuring Scrat chasing that nut was so absurd that I wanted to leave but figured that I should stay since those episodes would just be sprinkled throughout the film and are not the entirety of the story. I was not impressed by much of anything in this film, but as a summer release for kids and based on the sounds in the theater it clearly worked for them, for that reason I give it an amber light."

"sweet_and_sour_candyflos","1","10","19","2 July 2012"," Oh my goodness what have they created!?!
","I have always been a huge fan of the Ice age series, number 1 will always be my favourite because it was their original characters that made it, and number 2 not far behind because of the ingenious idea of a mammoth thinking she was a possum. I wasn't that keen on number 3 but it was still much better than this! <br/><br/>Much like Bambi 2 where they threw in a couple of adult scenes that stuck out against the cutesy cutesy childish scenes this movie was almost completely aimed at children. I think even young teenagers would cringe away from how humanised its become, take Peaches and her gang of mammoth friends who the animators took too much time trying to humanise by giving them human names (Ethan?) and making them act like Zack Effron and Vanessa from Highschool Musical. And if this wasn't bad enough there's a really cheesy sing song scene that should never have been done. EVER. <br/><br/>The story line was flat and predictable and with all the new characters brought in they were all flat and under developed. The only new character that brought any kind of Joy to the movie was Sid's granny who was the only light in what could only be described (for the first time of it's series) as a very cheesy children's movie. <br/><br/>I think by keeping Peaches as an infant, and having non - sing song pirates this movie might have been saved as they could have concentrated more on the fewer characters they brought in (Sids granny, the pirates and especially more time to develop the romance between Diego and the female saber rather than them just falling in love within 30 mins) and the older characters this movie forgot (crash and eddie were almost no where to be seen in this movie). Was a real disappointment for such a huge fan and while I was determined to go and see it another 4 times or so at the cinema after eagerly awaiting it- I don't think I'll bother. <br/><br/>I understand this movie is AIMED at kids but there was nothing stopping it before for making it just as enjoyable for adults to, since adults are the paying customer I think you will notice a large drop in sales especially from dedicated fans such as myself. Very very disappointed D="
"aaronjbong","7","6","10","16 July 2012"," After Human Encounter, Global Warming, and Dinosaurs, the Continent is Splitting
","We've arrived at the fourth chapter in the ""Ice Age"" franchise, and believe it or not, it's been a decade since the original film. The fourth one offers a great time for families, and is hilarious. However, after reaching its peak in ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"", I felt that ""Continental Drift"" was unsatisfying when compared to predecessors.<br/><br/>After protecting a human child, avoiding a meltdown, and surviving dinosaurs, the super continent of Pangeaea is separating into today's continents. All this is caused by our lovable squirrel Scrat, accidentally due to his endless quest to get his acorn. This causes a large landmass to move and separates Manny from his family (wife Ellie and now-grown daughter Peaches). Manny, along with sloth Sid, saber-toothed tiger Diego, and Sid's ""lunatic"" Granny, now stranded on a small block of floating ice, attempt to return back. Meanwhile, the moving landmass forces Ellie, Peaches and the other animals to head to a land bridge.<br/><br/>During their little journey, Manny, Sid, Diego, and Granny encounter a crew of pirates led by the ape Captain Gutt. From here on, we experience a whole lot more action scenes than we expected and needed and makes ""Continental Drift"" as the most action-packed installment of the series yet. While this is the most action-packed yet, I still think that the story is a bit lacking in richness. This installment lacks subplots causing me to believe that the filmmakers might have been quite lazy when writing the film. In fact, they recycled some of the elements from the previous films for this one. Quite embarrassing when the previous installments were all brilliant. <br/><br/>There were some subplots that try to enrich the story but some of them are just mediocre at best. This refers to the love subplot between Diego and one of Captain Gutt's apprentices, a saber-toothed tiger named Shira. After Diego saved her life, a relationship sparked but it had poor development. I felt it was too rushed and it would have been killer if they had been more careful. But well, it's a family movie. There's another one which features a love triangle between Peaches (Manny and Ellie's 19-year-old daughter), Louis (a mole hog who is Peaches's best friend and who has a crush on Peaches), and Ethan (the popular mammoth whom Peaches has a crush on and is unexpectedly voiced by rapper Drake). This one was done perfectly and was impressive. <br/><br/>I also felt that the film lacked that heart and touching feeling we experienced in the previous three films. I mean, we were sort of tickled when we discovered Manny's desire for family in the first film, and when we discovered Ellie's past in the second film, and when we saw Sid say his final goodbyes to the dinosaurs in the third film. In ""Continental Drift"" that feeling is gone. Nowhere to be found. I personally felt that that was one of the strongest points of the ""Ice Age"" films but it was nowhere to be found in this one. <br/><br/>For the first time, we catch a glimpse of Sid's family. That includes his mother, father, Granny and etc. Apparently they only came to dump ""lunatic"" Granny for Sid before they escaped because Granny is too hard to handle. Granny later on makes an addition to the trio and despite being sort of crazy, she proved to be useful in the climax of the scene.<br/><br/>In ""Continental Drift"" we meet new species of animals. We meet an ape, kangaroo, wild boar, rabbit, badger, elephant seal, a Blue-footed Booby, and more. Most of them are part of Gutt's crew. But interestingly, we meet a creature that is part of legend, Greek mythology to be exact. They are none other than the Sirens. They take on the appearance of loved ones to lure the animals into danger. They are indeed deadly, but were almost unable to lure Scrat, after taking the form of former girlfriend Scratte. <br/><br/>Speaking of Scrat, his quest to grab that acorn continues. This time, he encounters a map that would take him to the heaven of acorns, Scratlantis. He doesn't interact with the trio like they did in the previous installment. Even if you thought it would be exhausting to see him again and again, it never gets old. Seeing Scratch's futile attempts at getting his hands on the acorn is just hilarious. <br/><br/>I have to say the animation was excellent. It was wonderful, flawless and extremely detailed. This is a significant improvement over the previous three installments. The 3D works although it isn't mandatory. <br/><br/>There is a big crew of voice talents behind the studio. Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary, reprise their roles as Manny, Sid, and Diego, respectively and they are still better than ever. Queen Latifah also reprises her role as Ellie as she drives her character with power. Keke Palmer fills in the role of Manny and Ellie's teenage daughter Peaches, who is stubborn and grown-up. Some of today's hottest singers are also here. Rapper Drake fills in the voice of Ethan whereas Nicki Minaj provides the voice of Steffie, another woolly mammoth. We even have Jennifer Lopez filling in for Shira. <br/><br/>""Continental Drift"" may not be a worthy follow-up to the previous installments but it promises to be a great fun time in the theaters for families. It's hilarious and the most action-packed entry of the series yet. I just felt that it didn't capture the heart of the previous installments and the story wasn't rich enough. But hey, it's a family movie not a drama film. <br/><br/>Rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Final Verdict: It may not compare to its brilliant predecessors but ""Continental Drift"" is a promising movie-going experience for families filled with hilarious moments and action-packed sequences."
"illbebackreviews","6","3","4","19 October 2012"," It was still a good movie
","At times, I wonder why people feel so disappointed about this movie. I mean, these movies are mainly directed at younger children but I myself quite enjoyed this film. Surely, it wasn't as good as the other three but I really enjoyed many aspects of this film.<br/><br/>The voice acting and plot were good. I, in particular liked some of the new characters and wished some others would just explode. Characters I liked were Peaches, Louis, Sid's grandmother and his entire family, Shira and Gutt. Sure, Gutt wasn't the best villain ""bad guy"" they could get, but he made the storyline interesting. However, I truly hated Ethan and his friends (including those female mammoths who talk weirdly). <br/><br/>The biggest problem about this film is that its quite predictable. Whereas the previous three had twists and turns at the end, this one didn't leave me surprised. Captain Gutt's death was disappointing. I know its for comic purposes, but his death scene seemed so unrelated to the story.<br/><br/>Overall, a good movie. Not the best, but a fine addition to our beloved ""Ice Age"" series."

I sure give it 10 out of 10 for an adorable sense of humor which doesn't let you feel even a bit tired. even though we could have seen more of peaches and her romantic engagement she had.yet I'd say it definitely worth sticking your butt to seat for 1/5 hour. On the other hand it was not a closed end movie and sure we'll see much of new character like shira. Therefore If you want to feel your abdominal muscles in pain don't waste a sec"

","The Ice Age franchise is one of those things that boggles me, from the upstart, I have never been a fan, it drones on and on, and every film is just the three of them on a little journey, with interludes from the acorn loving Scrat.<br/><br/>But these beasts keep making money, and although the fourth instalments is a step up from the third, I give up disliking the movies because the y do their job and the y entertained my six year old.<br/><br/>This time Scrat moves an acorn and it causes a continental shift, and this little incident is the highlight of the film, it all goes downhill from there.<br/><br/>The three main guys get split from their families and must find a way to be back, but they run into pirates, led by Peter Dinklage and J-Lo (oh it's her because she sings at the end) and chaos ensues.<br/><br/>Oh and the guys are joined by SIDS senile grandmother, for comic relief, what popular animated franchise would need a loud comic relief character if they didn't know it was running out of steam?<br/><br/>It's watchable while it last, and I avoided the 3-D just because I'd heard bad things about it, but then I squirmed every time a character purposely pointed something at the camera.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the movies, you will lap this up.

"tomgillespie2002","3","4","6","30 September 2012"," Horrible fourth entry that panders to the Disney/MTV audience
","So Manny (Ray Romano), Sid (John Leguizamo), Diego (Denis Leary) et al return for yet another instalment of the hugely successful Ice Age franchise, to explore themes that have been re-cycled from previous films, and re-hash familiar plots. With the continents breaking up around them after a calamitous act by the returning Scrat, Manny is separated from Ellie (Queen Latifah) and his teenage daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) and washed out to sea. With the world seemingly becoming an ocean of floating glaciers, they are picked up by the maniacal pirate Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage), a gigantophithecus who wants to make them walk the plank. They escape, and must form a plan to seal Gutt's boat in order to meet up with Ellie, Peaches, and their wandering herd.<br/><br/>Similar to the plot strand in The Meltdown (2006) involving Manny and Ellie, who was torn given that she thought she was a different animal, Diego meets one of his fellow species Shira (Jennifer Lopez) aboard Gutt's ship, who is dedicated to Gutt's tyrannical rule regardless of how he treats her. Again the writers seem unable to come up with something inventive for Diego so have lumbered him with a shockingly uninvolving love story. Shira is merely one of many new additions, and apart from Dinklage's impressive Gutt and Nick Frost's hilariously brain-dead Flynn, none hit the mark. The introduction of Peaches, who arrived in the third (and best by far) instalment Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009) merely causes the film to explore TV-movie themes of family and generation, played out like a middle-class suburban family. Peaches even says to Manny ""I wish you weren't my father,"" before they are separated - yawn!<br/><br/>The creators seem to have lost all respect for themselves and the series after the hopeful third instalment, and have opted for an MTV/Disney Channel aesthetic, bringing in awful pop stars such as Lopez, Nicki Minaj, Drake and Heather Morris to satisfy the young generations' lust for these conveyor belt voices rather than some genuine voice talent. It's quite mystifying as to why they opted to leave out Simon Pegg's Buck (although he is glimpsed for a split second), who was the best thing about the previous film, and instead introduced this endless wave of forgetful characters. Even Scrat, usually a welcome diversion to the central action, is lacking any real ideas and fails to raise a laugh. And the film is wrapped up with an awful rendition of 'We Are Family' sang by the whole cast that caused me to instantly turn the volume down and stop the film as my body was uncontrollably cringing. Simply dreadful, and I doubt I'll continue with the series from now on.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"hugobolso-1","3","7","13","7 July 2012"," I missed Scratty
","and definitive is the worst of the ICE Age Franchise. Scratty is less than ten secconds. Eddy and Crash and Eddie also have very few minutes <br/><br/>The plot involve the annoying teenage mamut of Manny (Nicky Menage), and the evil pirates of ice age (Peter Dinklage as a gigant Jennifer Lopez a bad imitation of Jolie's Kung fu panda). Annoying too. <br/><br/>The best new character is Sid's Grandma (Wanda Sykes) who has by far the best lines.- From the main 3 trio only Sid had funny lines, specially the one with the Crab.- <br/><br/>Scrat segments are as always the highlights, however not as well as the others IA.<br/><br/>The 3D is good but not spectacular-"
"moviexclusive","7","4","7","7 July 2012"," The franchise's most action-packed instalment yet, this is a fast-paced adventure packed with thrills and laughs- and of course Scrat
","You can't blame franchise newcomers Steve Martino and Mike Thurmeier for sticking with formula- after all, the past three entries have grown increasingly successful on the back of a similar template. So fans of the prehistoric toon series will be comforted to know that once more, the unlikely trio of Manny the woolly mammoth, Sid the sloth and Diego the tiger are forced to rely on each other as some cataclysmic event forces them to migrate from their homely habitats for safer territory. And oh yes, there's always Scrat's pursuit of his prized acorn thrown in for good measure. <br/><br/>In fact, from the occasional diversion, Scrat's ceaseless quest now sets in motion the chain of events in the story- though keener audiences might recognise the familiarity of this sequence with that of 'Scrat's Continental Crack-up', a short which Fox attached to 'Gulliver's Travels' back in 2010. Nonetheless, it's amusing all the same, and culminates in the separation of Pangaea, the huge land mass from which the various continents originated from. No thanks to Scrat, Manny gets separated from his wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) and teenage daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer), and spend the rest of the movie trying to get back to them. <br/><br/>It's by far their most action-packed adventure yet- even more so than their previous encounter with the dinosaurs- and therefore fully poised to exploit the possibilities offered by 3D. Indeed those hesitant at shelling out the extra bucks for the additional dimension will find this a worthy investment, as directors Martino and Thurmeier are not shy to turn their adventure into a glorified roller-coaster ride- especially in the numerous POV shots when one character or another slides across the ice, glides down the glaciers and flies through the air. Scoff at the cheap thrills if you must, but there's no denying that it makes for great fun particularly for the kids. <br/><br/>To get into action mode, recurrent series writer Michael Berg and his newbie partner Jason Fuchs (working from a story by Berg and Lori Forte) create an irascible villain in the form of mangy ape Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage)- the leader of a motley band of pirates including an elephant seal named Mr Flynn (Nick Frost) and a white sabre-toothed tiger named Shira (Jennifer Lopez). While Diego gets a love interest in Shira, Manny gets to show off his masculine side with a mano-a-mano fight against Gutt, whose paths he inadvertently cross when he destroys the latter's ship-berg (that's the best name we could come up with for their icebergs turned ships) and then makes off with the latter's replacement. <br/><br/>Alongside the main act of Manny and Gutt, other characters also get their own stories- Sid is visited by his cantankerous granny (Wanda Sykes) similarly abandoned by his family; and Peaches distances herself from her best friend Louis (Josh Gad) in an attempt to keep up with the in-crowd (voiced in celebrity cameos by Drake, Nicki Minaj and Glee cheerleader Heather Morris) while going against the expressed wishes of her overprotective father Manny. It all comes to a neat closure of course, and even though none of these story arcs are inventive, they at least succeed in keeping the comic energy up throughout the movie. <br/><br/>And certainly, both Martino and Thurmeier deserve credit for sustaining a brisk snappy pace all the way, avoiding the stretches of dull that plagued the first two 'Ice Age' films. More than any of the previous instalments, this fourth entry confidently rests on the charms of its lead characters Manny, Sid and Diego and less on the zaniness of Scrat. It's a surest sign yet that the franchise is truly coming into its own, further exemplified by the leaps and bounds by which Fox's Blue Sky Studios has improved its technical standards, and you can bet that as formulaic as it is, this franchise isn't quite going the way of the ice age anytime soon.<br/><br/><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>"
"bad_beth666","4","6","13","6 July 2012"," The end of a successful saga
","First of all, if you are like me, and were disappointed with this movie, you may be surprised at the ratings on IMDb. For example- The gem of British comedy, Flushed Away, was ranked worse than this. Both Madagascar movies, were ranked worse than this. The third Ice Age installment, was ranked one point off this. <br/><br/>Really? Folks, I'm not going to sugar coat this thing. It was a awful end to a great saga. With the Ice Age movies, I notice each one of them seems to slip deeper and deeper into unrealistic expectations, making it almost impossible for children to believe what is on the screen, as I was doing with the children I had taken with me. First Ice Age - Animals return child to parent. Quite simple, sweet. Second- World is melting, somehow a giant boat will save them all. Pretty weird, but watchable. Third- Dinosaurs under the ice. Right, that's going off the mark. But the character Buck saved the movie with brilliant British comedy and writing. <br/><br/>And then there's this trainwreck. Sid, Manny and Diego, and a Granny of Sids, find themselves battling a ship full of pirates who enjoy singing and bossing little furry creatures around. My god. <br/><br/>I don't even know where to start with this thing. First off, Manny has had the ol 'Disney parent syndrome' slapped on him, and he is dangerously worried about his teenager daughter, Peaches, constantly. We've seen it done in every single daddy-daughter movie. They even had the gall to send Crash and Eddie to watch her frequently. It's like they had just watched Lion King 2, swapped some characters around, then claimed it original. <br/><br/>Peaches problem is just about the most predictable teenage story in the book. > Girl finds cool group. > Ditches lame friends, becomes popular > Regrets it later. Yeah, it's pretty lame. But thats just the start of this...analysis. <br/><br/>Right, so they get separated as continents are drifting at a alarming rate, complete with a pop culture reference about each one which was clearly existent back in the BC. Sid gets dumped with this god awful Granny relative, who is stealing screen time as Sid's side comic relief. She is not funny. Sid is funny. Do not add TWO funny characters in a troupe, it never works. They come across this-ugh, pirate ship, run by a monkey, an elephant seal, a kangaroo, and a predictably female saber tooth tiger. It is awful from there. <br/><br/>This installment even has a song, too. The song itself actually wasn't so bad, but it is SO not in an Ice Age nature to do so, as no other movies did it, that people just kinda were confused as to whether it was a musical. There's a lovely cheesy song at the end too, don't worry. It'll suck any remaining dignity out of the movie. <br/><br/>I'm not even sure if Ice Age 2 or this one is worse. Probably this one, because everything is just so unrealistic. Kids in the audience were even realizing it. It's just a load of action, clichés, corny family messages, and very very predictable rubbish. Keep your money."
"morphricky","2","3","5","8 December 2012"," Clichés.... clichés everywhere!
","Just wow... I give it a two because the animation is still really nice. I would have given it 3 if it wasn't for Queen Latifah forcing every single line with no ounce of passion in it.<br/><br/>How did they manage to cram so many clichés into this movie? By the start, you could already tell how plenty of the things would end up. You knew Peaches would like Louis the best, you knew Shera would somehow end up with Diego again, you knew Peaches wouldn't end up with Ethan... why do I even bother listing it - there was not one single surprise in this movie! The clichés are not only predictable, but so painfully obvious that it feels like you are watching a completely different movie. Did I put in the wrong DVD? I'm pretty sure it didn't say ""Teenage Drama 4-ever"" on the cover.<br/><br/>The characters had zero development to their character. In the other movies, I felt plenty of the characters had great development. What happened here? Did the screenwriters just want to come up with something for the characters to do for the duration of the movie? Why not try to do an actual spin on the cliché ""I insulted my father just before he went missing, the last thing he will remember is our argument, boo-hoo!"" - instead you've watched the same conclusion in at least 5 other movies. Captain Gut (who I kept calling Davy Jones) is nothing but an clichéd evil character. No back-story, no development. Just an angry monkey.<br/><br/>The movie also left the impression that the writers were so out of ideas that they just decided to make references to other movies. And who knows, maybe they just picked a few scenes from other movies and animated them with their own characters, seeing as the characters has absolutely no development at all. <br/><br/>This is 2012, but it felt like watching a movie from 1992! <br/><br/>There's also huge inconsistencies in the movie, like how Manny can be sucked up a tornado and fall over a hundred meters, yet a single snowball can knock him unconscious. Davy Jones spends literally hours building a boat to ride the currents and when he gets it stolen, he just breaks a big block of ice from a wall and has some narwhals pushing it. Why didn't he do this in the beginning?<br/><br/>I did get a few chuckles from the only funny characters in the movie. The grandma, although a walking cliché, was a comic relief between the serious main cast. The Elephant Seal was also entertaining, just because he was so jolly all the time while being so stupid. I normally find the two possums annoying, but here I was literally begging them to come back on screen! In conclusion: The drama made me want to claw my ears off, the jokes are few and far between. The animation is nice, while the voice work sounds extremely forced."
"TheLittleSongbird","6","3","5","17 August 2012"," Great animation and some nice characters, but perhaps a sequel too far
","I really liked the first Ice Age film, enjoyed the second but was mixed on the third. I loved Mammoth Christmas and Continental Crack-Up though. I do consider Ice Age: Continental Drift the weakest of the series with the sense that it was a sequel too far and that the franchise was flagging. However it is not a bad movie. The animation is absolutely great, the scenery is just gorgeous and the colours very vibrant. The characters are also modelled very well. The music score is beautiful and rousing on the whole, there are a couple of amusing moments- the beginning is a riot- and there are some nice characters. Scrat continues to steal every scene he's in and Sid and Granny are a real delight. Captain Gutt is a nice addition also. The voice actors do fine jobs, Peter Dinklage is deliciously evil, Ray Romano and Dennis Leary are just as strong and John Leguizamo is hilarious. Conversely, the story is weak on the whole, thin on the ground and sometimes drags, while the script lacks wit and freshness. Peaches I didn't care for as a character either, coming across as stereotypical and bratty. Last but not least, the musical number, not only was it awfully written with a rushed melody and unfunny lyrics but there was absolutely no need for it to be there in the first place. Overall, not bad but didn't wow me. I do think they should stop here before the standard gets worse. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

","I have watched all Ica age series and all I can tell you, that this last part is a huge disappontment. The movie did not move forward at all in describing the main character, there was no surprise element and nothing to the audience. It is basically a story as everyone would expect and the ending was not surprising at all. Kids around us(me and my girlfriend) were happy for seeing their characters and had a bit of fun at the beginning, but once the full story has been uncovered, no one spoke. I do hope they did not get bored as well? Graphics were nice and pleasant, in this way there was a slight improvement, but that is mainly all. There was only one element I did enjoy, it was new character of grandma, who brought a bit of fun for us."

","My entire family and I have enjoyed every single chapter in the ""Ice Age"" saga since the beginning. We the first three movies on DVD/Blu-ray and watch them when we can. But this movie really made us laugh hard. When I saw this movie in the theater, there were definitely a lot of teenagers (aside from me) laughing at the action that occurs between Manny, Sid, Scrat, Diego and the others. Kids, teens and even adults will enjoy the fourth chapter in the trilogy. Kids will laugh at the characters, but teens may relate to Peaches even more because they go through the same effects that many face in real life (fitting in, getting a love interest). Adults will also like to say that there's some newcomers to the saga, including Canadian rapper, Drake (of Degrassi: TNG fame), Nicki Minaj, Wanda Sykes, Aziz Ansari (of NBC's Parks & Recreation), Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: TNG), Kunal Nayyar (of the Big Bang theory), Heather Morris (of Glee) and Jennifer Lopez (if you watched American idol this season, Ice Age 4: Continetal Drift popped up quite a lot). It's Pirates of the Caribbean meets Ice Age in this hilarious fourth chapter!! An extremely hilarious story for kids, teens and adults of all ages!! Take your kids, your girlfriend or boyfriend, spouse or better yet your entire family!! They will enjoy the film from start to finish!!!"
"dmhughes-448-695102","4","2","3","13 August 2012"," This Series Is Tired...Why Is There Another Sequel?
","I was a huge Ice Age fan growing up as a kid. The original had a great story, funny dialog, memorable characters, and stellar animation from Blue Sky Studios. Since then we've gotten two sequels, Ice Age: The Meltdown, and Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. Meltdown had great animation, but overall felt like a poorly written sequel designed simply to suck money from our wallets. Dawn of the Dinosaurs was better; almost as good as the original. It had even better animation, and actually had a good story and some great jokes for both adults and kids. However, as soon as I saw the five-minute Scrat short at last year's Rio, I realized that the series had taken a turn for the worst. <br/><br/>This is the worst Ice Age film yet. The story feels tired; the jokes are mostly bland; the inclusion of Wanda Sykes as Sid the Sloth's grandmother is a huge mistake; and this film commits the greatest of sins: it has an awful musical number in the middle of the movie. Ugh, it still makes me cringe. The story is about how Manny, Sid, and Diego are separated from their herd and family after the continent starts to break apart. Our heroic trio sail across the sea only to be captured by a band of pirates that sail an iceberg shaped like an old Spanish galleon. Diego gets a love interest, and Scrat continues to hunt for that blasted acorn. <br/><br/>Sure, the animation is great, and the 3D actually works well, but everything about this film is just mediocre. From the bad story, to the uninspired voice acting, to the jaw-droppingly bad musical number, and Scrat's never-ending screams, this is a franchise that will probably see another sequel in three to four years, even though it should have stopped with the dinosaurs, and just feels like an excuse to grab more cash rather than create new, inventive animated films.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 4/10"
"MovieReviews101","4","2","3","5 August 2012"," Disappointing
","I was really disappointed with this movie. I felt quite bored by this one. They had standards to meet but they did not meet them. The first three were great and original but this one just had 'the end of the world'theme to it. I felt like they didn't care about this movie as much as they did with the other ones. Kids will definitely like it because it's 'Ice Age' but I don't think that adult's will like it quite as much. It's not as original as the first one and not as funny as the third one. Manny seems quite tired with all these unfortunate events happening to him and his friends. I maybe had a few laughs but that was all. It's getting quite predictable about what might happen next. I recommend it if you have a child. If you want to watch this be prepared for disappointment."

"matteaton100","4","2","3","21 July 2012"," Better as a trilogy...#4 was a disappointment
","I just love the ice age series, they were funny, classic, and all around family fun. Number 4 was indeed funny but an awful sequel to the franchise. Ill explain why.<br/><br/>If you had watched Ice Age 1 thru 3 you can tell how well the character development was, i mean everybody like Manny and the herd was in every single scene throughout those movies. And the story plots were well organized and very entertaining.<br/><br/>Ice Age 4 was nothing but a bunch of side stories crammed into a short film, totally confusing! The movie had so many stories and so many new characters, it being that way...hardly anybody was shown like Crash and Eddie well they were only in three scenes. And Ellie wasn't in the movie much either. Nor was Shira and Diego loving each other.. shocking!<br/><br/>Lets not forget about the plot, there were a lot of different stories rather than the main plot.... Peaches love interest, Manny dealing with her teenage life, continental drift, Louis loving peaches, Ethan and his friends against Louis, teenage drama, and last but not least Diego's lover shira. BTW Shira and the pirates didn't show up till halfway through the film. All of these stories in a 90 min film was like trying to put twenty pounds of potatoes into a ten pound bag.<br/><br/>This movie was supposed to be big about pirates and a lover for Diego, well it was bad enough that Shira and Diego didn't actually show love for each other until most of the movie was over, what a drag that was.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think the fourth would have been better if Buck and Scratte were in it more if they had joined the herd from film 3 because Buck and Scratte hit the spotlight instead of these new teenage mammoths and a geeky mole hog. Better yet, if they had stop at 3 and not make a fourth. (Buck and Scratte did make a cameo role in Ice Age 4)<br/><br/>With that being said, All the new characters in this film as one big family with Manny, this herd will never be the same again!"
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","2","3","15 July 2012"," Best at pure slapstick but deadly dull when it tries to deal with family issues
","Ice Age: Continental Drift is a movie that is best at moments of pure slapstick and deadly dull and boring when it tries to deal with the personal problems of the characters. What do we care about the love affairs, friendships and family issues among tigers, sloths, possums and woolly mammoths? Weighing the inclusion of both the comic and the personal elements, finally the family issues take over and the movie upends. It isn't a terrible movie, just a flawed comedy with tiny gems mixed in.<br/><br/>This is no less than the third sequel to the 2002 hit Ice Age which was successful by keeping its story and characters lean and funny. The sequels have mistakenly tried to give the three leads Manny the Mammoth, Diego the Sabertooth and Sid the Sloth comfortable family relations. But who cares? We're more interested in watching them be funny then be a family.<br/><br/>The story this time is set off by the hapless Scrat the Squirrel whose never-ending pursuit of his elusive acorn causes a rift that splits up Pangaea which, if you'll recall from geography class, was the massive super-continent that split apart 200 million years ago and settled into the continents we have today. Meanwhile, Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano) is having trouble being a strict father to his daughter Peaches (voiced by Keke Palmer) and finds himself separated from this family by an ice break and (rather predictably) after an argument.<br/><br/>Set adrift on a large chunk of ice with pals Diego (voice by Denis Leary), Sid the Sloth (voice by John Leguizamo) and Sid's foul-smelling, toothless Granny (voiced by Wanda Sykes) the quartet try to find their way back to the continent so Manny can rejoin the family. Along the way, the rag-tag band is accosted by a pirate ship-shaped glacier captained by an obnoxious Pirate baboon called Gutt (voiced by Peter Dinklage) whose plan for our heroes, is . . . well, not really explained very well. Kill them, maybe? He'll do whatever a pirate does. He certainly can't rob them, they aren't carrying anything of value.<br/><br/>Actually the baboon is quite a boring character. He's all menace and bad teeth and pirate jokes that don't really go anywhere. He's there to be your standard movie villain, show up to provide a problem and then get his comeuppance. Peter Dinklage, the Emmy winner from HBO's Game of Thrones does what he can with the voice, but he really has nothing to work with. Gutt's crew aren't that interesting either. They include a bloodthirsty rabbit, a dumb-witted Elephant Seal, a badger, a kangaroo and a white tiger with the voice of Jennifer Lopez.<br/><br/>None of these characters have any real personality. They are merely a part of the set design. They come on screen, have their personality traits and then disappear from the film as quickly as they disappear from our memory. The one new character in the film that actually works is the character of Granny, Sid's seemingly senile old grandmother. As played by Wanda Sykes, she is a work of comic joy and is welcomed every time she comes on screen. A nice running gag about whether or not her often-mention pet Precious is dead (or real) gives the movie a nice payoff. Sykes, of course, is a wonderful comedienne who has the perfect voice for animation and a knack for raising dead movies like Over the Hedge, Monster-in-Law, and Evan Almighty out of the doldrums.<br/><br/>The other gem of the film is the required role for Scrat the Squirrel who always appears around the edges of these movies, and whose role this time is set off by a treasure map carved inside a hollowed-out acorn that he finds at the bottom of the sea. What's waiting for him at the other end of the map is best left for you to discover. It provides the best moment in the movie, and proves once again that Scrat is one of the great cartoon characters. He deserves his own movie.<br/><br/>The problem is that in order to get to Scrat's payoff, we have to sit through a dusty old plot involving Manny's family problems. There some nonsense about his daughter Peaches' friendship with a trustworthy possum and whether or not she will ditch him to go with the popular group. This subplot is as dull as it sounds. Who cares? This is a comedy, and it is best when it plays like a slapstick comedy. We perk up at the comic moments and we check our watches during the family drama. The movie is too stuffed with uninteresting characters. The better half of the cast is played by former stand-up comedians: Ray Romano, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo, Wanda Sykes, and the least interesting characters are played by musicians: Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Keke Palmer, Nicki Minaj. Next time - and it may be inevitable that there will be a next time - maybe the cast needs some trimming and that might be a good place to start. Let the comedy lead the pack and let the rest just go extinct."

We finally meet his family in this film, although only for a while, and clearly understands why they left without him in the first place. We also meet his Granny - a wonderful (ugly) character!! Granny is a completely different character to the rest of the gang and a fantastic addition to the franchise.<br/><br/>The film is filled with lots of action, adventure and intrigue, and features a great antagonist - the first real antagonist in the series - the Pirate Captain Gutt. Diego also finally meets another Sabre Tiger. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this installment, as well. This was another great action adventure thrill ride."

"sterlinrivera-2000","7","1","1","10 May 2019"," A Likable Sequel
","While I enjoyed the first three Ice Age movies, Ice Age: Continental Drift is one that I simply like.<br/><br/>This time around, Scrat the sabor-tooth squirrel is trying to bury his acorn, but then he ends up falling down into the Earth's core and running on it, causing land to drift apart (thus calling it a continental drift). Because of this, the land that Manny, Sid, Diego, and the rest of the herd are on is getting destroyed. Manny, Sid, and Diego get seperated out in the ocean and away from Ellie, Crash & Eddie, and Manny's new daughter, Peaches (voiced by Keke Palmer). The three then meet up with a pirate crew lead my a savage monkey named Captain Gutt, who captures them. They now have to escape the clutches of his crew and survive the natural disaster that is going on.<br/><br/>What does hurt this movie slightly is the comedy. It's half funny, and half dumb and cringy. There were some funny moments, and there were some lame moments. Another thing is it is not directed by Carlos Saldanha, who co directed the first movie, and directed the second and third movie. So maybe that's why it may not seem as enjoyable as the first three.<br/><br/>But what helps this movie is the animation is yet again amazing, the voice acting is pretty good, the story was pretty good and had some epic moments. I do like the new characters as well that are introduced, like Peaches, who was in the last movie, but is now grown up. There's also Shira (played by Jennifer Lopez) who was working for Captain Gutt, but then falls in love with Diego and joins the herd.<br/><br/>Overall, it may not be as good as the first three, but Ice Age: Continental Drift is a worthy sequel."

","There's nothing new in the fourth installment of the Ice Age series. This has never been a franchise about finding new angles on its characters or seeking to create something that resonates. They just change enough elements to make it not seem like a total rehash and cast a few more pop culture-y voice actors (hi, J-Lo and Nicki Minaj!). In this episode, the role of baddies is filled by some pirate animals, whose main motivation for being evil is that they are pirates, and Manny the mammoth and friends once more look for a new home as the world continues to demand their extinction.

Another problem is the lack of action, funny moments or something that makes the audience to pay attention to the screen.

","Talk about a film series that just has absolutely no reason to continue on whatsoever. This film was no exception. There was no real reason to continue the Ice Age series. The first movie was an original classic, unique in animation, heartwarming story, distinct characters that had not been seen before, and some hilarious comedy. The second movie was okay, taking the same characters onto a clichéd search for love as well as trying to survive the great melt down. The comedy was okay with occasional laughs, but not a strong story as the last one. The third one was not too bad with dinosaurs, a cool guide named Buck, and it actually had an excellent end to the entire series. This movieget ready to cringe!<br/><br/>The story: The continental drift is Scrat's fault, which separates Manny from his family, taking Sid and Diego with him. Sid has an insane grandmother to look after (because one sloth wasn't annoying enough), Diego gets a rushed love acquaintance who is sidekick to a chimpanzee pirate, while Manny's teenage daughter finds out that being ""cool"" isn't cool, and Scrat is looking for a treasure island.<br/><br/>As you can tell from the story, there's way too much story, too complex in some areas and in others simplified, and all the clichés we've heard to death. I think the writers should learn that the more all over the place the focus of the story is, the more forgettable it becomes, which is what happened to this film. Also the comedy is a groan fest. Nothing is original or that funny, and they all revolve around Sid and his grandmother who has got to be the most obnoxious character ever. She's made to look insane when she's really sane, which sometimes can work, but in a tired series with barely anything original and casting Wanda Sykes (who can be a great comedienne) causes the comedy to go downhill. <br/><br/>Also there is little to no chemistry between Diego and Jennifer Lopez saber tooth. I know she has a name, but it's getting hard to tell the difference between the celebrity voice actress and the character. It only seemed like she was there just to pay off a debt. The relationship between Manny and his daughter is about as similar as Ariel and Triton, only taking Manny out of character and being way too overprotective. If they had mentioned before that he lost his first child to predators like in the very first movie, I would have given it a pass, but nothing is ever brought up from that movie again. <br/><br/>But the biggest problem I have with this film is what does an Ice Age film have anything to do with a Sinbad and Treasure Island film? Really, what does it have anything to do with Ice Age? It makes the animals too humanistic and too silly. Though to be fair, the villain is the only memorable thing and a tad more interesting than anything else. I like how he's smooth talking and murderous for a creature that's suppose to be playful. Why didn't he get his own movie? Why did it have to be combined with Ice Age? I would have been a million more times interested if the film was about a murderous seafaring chimpanzee version of Blackbeard who was the most feared pirate of all the seven seas. <br/><br/>I still don't get why Ice Age had to be milked to the core, but it's getting painful. Even the most devout of Ice Age fans agree that this movie was the least of the entire series (verdict is still out on the upcoming Ice Age film). I don't know what else I can say about this film other than PLEASE STOP MAKING MORE AND END ALREADY!"

","I watched this on a very slow day at work with 4 other adults, thanks to someone's Netflix account. Considering this is a ""kids"" movie its worth mentioning how much we all laughed, were super entertained and except for the occasional customer glued to the screen.<br/><br/>I suppose they have recycled ideas from the previous films but I only ever saw the first movie years ago so this felt fresh and fun to me, jumping from action sequence to action sequence and filled with brilliant, even beautiful animation. Even our oldest and grumpiest staff member had a smile on his face.<br/><br/>I think the thing that surprised me the most here was seeing Peter Dinklage's name attached in the credits,. He voiced Captain Gutt the bad Orangutan pirate captain, what a fantastic accent he put on, I never would have guessed it was him.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the story here too following the gang as an earthquake sets an entire continent adrift. They use an iceberg as a makeshift ship, which launches them on an epic seafaring quest where they encounter sea creatures, battle ruthless pirates and explore a brave new world. There is romance and I loved seeing squirrel again who had even that ""odd customer"" stopping to watch with us. Isn't it about time the prehistoric squirrel got his own feature film?"
"taylorkingston","9","1","1","24 May 2015"," Still a great franchise...
","I love this movie. It's so funny and entertaining. I love how the continents all drift apart. I love how in the trailer, Scrat is the one who made the continents split apart, and I love that because of that, that's how giraffes got their long necks, from being stretched.<br/><br/>In this movie, Manny, Diego and Sid embark on yet another adventure after their continent is set adrift. It's really cool. They then use an iceberg as a ship, where they encounter many sea creatures and battle pirates as they explore this brave, new world. <br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Amazing."

","I believe ice age 4 could have done so much better, The pros for this movie in my opinion are, Diego finally gets a love interest: thank goodness i loved Shira! an excellent new character, The comedy: i love Sid's grandmother she is one of the reasons i keep coming back to this movie, The cons however are what really ruins this movie for me, The villains: man oh man was this a total letdown really pirates?! it doesn't exactly fit with the ice age, Unnecessary characters: the teens and Louis are just some examples of unnecessary additions, and finally character roles: characters like Ellie, crash, Eddie, peaches and even Shira needed bigger roles, in my opinion the herd should have met Shira a different way, so overall it was good at times but lacked a bit hopefully ice age 5 won't suffer like this"

"natashabowiepinky","6","1","1","4 August 2013"," No end in sight, I do reckon...
","Things have changed a lot in four movies. We started off a mammoth, a sloth, a tiger and a baby, to virtually an entire zoo worth of creatures. This does mean the material is spread pretty thin as everyone competes for a speaking part, and the director's apparent insistence that almost every line must be a wisecrack. Still, the nucleus of the series remains strong, and it provides for yet another solid hour-and-a-bit worths of entertainment.<br/><br/>The best character remains Scrat, that ever-lovable squirrel(?) on his non-stop quest to bury his nut. All the best scenes revolve around him, and its amazing how much comic mileage you can derive from such a simple premise. If he was a human, he could be the biggest silent star since Charlie Chaplin. But he's not. Oh well, guess he's stuck with sleeping all winter and being run over by careless drivers, then... 6/10"

I loved the pirates that kidnapped them all. They were really funny and they fit into the film really well. You also get to meet Sid's granny. She was hilarious.

He is such a great character. I am surprised there is not a spin off movie yet just set on him. He is and always has been the star of the movies. Besides without Scrat, there would be no movie he causes all the mess in the first place. <br/><br/>The film is full of action and adventure, which is what you want when watching a family film. The kids will love this. I watched it with a load of adults but I will put it on again for my daughter as she loved the other 3.<br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>Very entertaining and made the Ice Age films more appealing again but I still hope they don't make any more as I don't want it to get stale.<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"
"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","7","1","1","15 February 2013"," A bit of an improvement over the third, but not nearly as strong as the first
","It's been a long time since I watched the first Ice Age when I was a little kid and only saw the second film in theaters, but not the third because I knew that it was going to be a disappointment. When I watched it, however, I thought it was OK. Then, Blue Sky made yet another Ice Age movie and being a bit of a Ice Age fan, I went to see this with my dad in theaters before Thanksgiving. Later, we had a great time and I think that this is a pretty good sequel. It's not as strong as the original Ice Age, but it's a bit better than Dawn of the Dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Let me start off the bad points of the movie. The story does have some charming moments including the battle between the main characters and the pirates along with the final battle between Manny and Captain Gutt, but it lacks the heart and wit of the original film and has several scenes that are completely rushed. The dialog is very contrived and the minute length could've been a little bit longer.<br/><br/>Now to the good points. The animation is fantastic especially the ice that floats. The character animation is pretty good too with some nice details on the fur. The main characters from the first three films are still as charming. I liked Peaches, but the best character goes to Captain Gutt who is a great villain thanks to Peter Dinklage's performance. Some of the voice work including Ray Romano, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo, Queen Latifah and others are as strong. The music from John Powell is rousing and energetic and the there are some gags that gave me a chuckle or two.<br/><br/>Overall, Ice Age: Continental Drift isn't an excellent sequel, but like I said before, it's marginally better than Dawn of the Dinosaurs. Blue Sky Studios is making another Ice Age and I wish they would've ended the franchise with this installment."
"paul_haakonsen","7","1","1","4 January 2013"," Great fun for the entire family...
","Having seen the first two ""Ice Age"" movies and enjoyed them, I sat down to watch this one with the family. And I must say that I was thoroughly entertained.<br/><br/>As with the prior movies, the animation in this one was great, and the CGI was really nice to look at and greatly detailed. And the characters in the movie were likable, funny and charismatic, just as in the prior movies.<br/><br/>The story in ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" is about our beloved group of friends who are sent out to see after their land is destroyed and broken apart by the forming of the continents. And on their journey to get back home they have a great adventure and meet a myriad of interesting creatures.<br/><br/>The voice acting is great, just as in the prior movies, and they still have some really nice people on the cast list for the various roles, and a good amount of distinctive voices.<br/><br/>For a family animated movie, then ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" is a great movie for kids and adults alike, because there is something in this movie for just about anyone. If you enjoy animated movies, then you should be well familiar with the ""Ice Age"" series by now, if not, then it is not too late to start your acquaintance."
"doglover_08","7","1","1","10 December 2012"," Just as good as Ice Age 1 and 3 and better than Ice Age 2
","When I was waiting at the cinemas to see this, a lot of young kids and a couple of teachers from a school came in and they were going to see Ice Age 4 as well. Lucky I got my ticket, a box of popcorn and drink before going into see Ice Age 4 before they came in, otherwise the cinema would be packed and I'd have to come back another day. I knew this would be so much better than Ice Age 2 - The Meltdown with all the new characters being in the last Ice Age movie.<br/><br/>I don't know if this is the last Ice Age movie or not, but they should stop on this one. 4 movies is enough. Even though this is rated slightly lower than Ice Age 2 and should deserve a 7, I still think it's better and funnier than number 2 and just as funny as 1 and 3. Some of you may agree with me, some of you may not.<br/><br/>A lot of the new characters were very funny. I knew who did the voices of the main characters in the Ice Age collection. The people who I've heard of who do the voices of some of the characters in Ice Age 4 are Nick Frost, Kunal Nayyar, Nicki Minaj, Rebel Wilson, Peter Dinklage and Jennifer Lopez. They all did a very good job at voicing their characters, especially Nick Frost voicing Flynn.<br/><br/>I thought it would have been longer than 87 minutes, but it was really worth my $13 to go and see it and I'm glad I did see it, otherwise if I didn't see it, I'd just download it or buy it. I highly recommend you to go and see this if you've enjoyed the previous Ice Age movies."

","I have watched this movie. If we compare it to the previous ice age movies, it is a little disappointed because this movie had a little humorous scenes but had a lot of serious scenes. Hmm, I think have many serious scenes was not suitable with ice age because ice age is a funny movies. I wished in this movie, the main character was not Manny's family again. But the fact was Manny's family again, although there were also Sid'family a little bit. If they add Diego scene with the girl, I thought its better, because Diego only has a few scenes. Steve Martino and Mike Thurmeier must have another way to make these movies ""come back"" in box office."
"ymeer_maxi","6","1","1","29 September 2012"," Great animation, cute characters, charming....needs to push itself further!
","This is the fourth installment of the Ice Age series. The first made a huge impact, it's heart warming story and characters won millions of hearts. Then came the Ice Age: The Meltdown, which to be quite honest I didn't enjoy that much, then came the third Ice Age : Dawn Of The Dinosaurs which I really enjoyed since it added new characters and I liked the new environment instead of always staying on ""Ice"" like the first two movies, it was a welcome change. Now we have the fourth movie in the series Ice Age: Continental Drift which retreats back to the first two movies, which by this point is ""been there, seen that"" scenario.<br/><br/>By now you might have noticed that where do I think Ice Age's downfall is. The Story itself is pretty straight forward and the same scenario / story was already told in Ice Age 2: The Meltdown. Don't know why they decided to do it again instead of adding something new? The characters remain the same as we remember, cute and lovable. The animation looks extremely well done this time around.<br/><br/>By no means is Ice Age : Continental Drift a terrible movie. Is it entertaining? Yes. Does it have a cast of cute characters? Yes. Is the story good? Yes, good enough to keep your attention, but by the end of the day you will realize that it's fairly similar to the first two movies which you have seen before. If there is going to be a fifth installment in the series, they really need to breath new life in the series in order to prevent it from becoming just another pretty looking all style and no substance animation movie."
"ryokan_wc","7","1","1","27 July 2012"," OK... but not the best so far.
","The trio is back with the fourth installment- or no? Ice Age 4 revisits Manny, Diego and Sid in an all new adventure with a geological flavour of event- the Continental Drift happening before their very eyes, comically caused by the ever-pursuing Scrat over the acorn. As years have passed, Peaches (Manny and Ellie's daughter mammoth) grows up into a young teen, Sid welcomes his family especially his grandma and Diego finds love in their quest. The Earth plates begin to move, resulting in the trio being separated from the rest of their community. Soon, they face pirates and must work together to survive and reunite with their loved ones. That's about it. Simple, direct and somewhat formulaic.<br/><br/>That's what Ice Age has been doing and the third (Dawn of the Dinosaur) paid well of as it becomes my favourite of this franchise. I particularly enjoyed the first half of the movie- how the Earth or land splits and moves with the graphics a wonder to watch and the hilarious scenes like the trio going through a storm. The ending falls rather flat and short. Unlike the Dawn of the Dinosaur (yes, i'm comparing with the third but i shouldn't), i didn't get the suspense and thrill when watching the climax of events. No doubt, this movie has everything done neat and clean but i personally did not find it memorable.<br/><br/>The characters remain an interesting herd to watch. Manny continues to be grumpy but apart from that, now he becomes a father figure. Sid's craziness and wackiness is one of the strongest points of the show, or franchise to be exact. He never stops to entertain with his awkwardness. And Diego, i guess every man would relate to him- being masculine and tough yet soft on the inside. Peaches and Louis cute friendship. Again, that's just it. I found this movie to lack characterization in the other characters. The granny introduced was a nice addition but sometimes, i find her to be a tad too annoying. The pirates were just pirates playing their roles as villains but nothing further.<br/><br/>This movie is OK may be because i had a high expectation of this movie since the third installment. Hopefully this is not the last of the Ice Age franchise because i am not thoroughly satisfied with an ending as such. Much said, it is still a good watch for a family outing because apart from the comical scenes and adventure, Ice Age 4: Continental Drift does have some values to learn and reminds you that you have each other."

"Boba_Fett1138","5","3","6","13 July 2012"," For kids only I guess.
","Man, I hadn't even realized that I am two movies behind in this series. As it turns out, I have only seen the first ""Ice Age"" movie and remember it being a simple but yet very warm and entertaining animated movie, that I truly liked watching. Guess a lot has happened in and to the series in between and I got a totally different vibe from this movie, which was not a very positive one, I should say.<br/><br/>You could definitely say that this movie is mostly being orientated towards young children. So you see lots of jumping around and characters stumbling and falling from high cliffs and unfortunately the movie doesn't become any more creative or more clever than that. The written visuals jokes and dialog aren't being all that funny or clever and original. So really, while kids might still like watching this movie, the adults accompanying them most likely won't have the best time. But hey, it apparently is mostly being a kids movie, so I won't hold that against the movie too much. It still serves its purpose but it remains such a big shame that there really isn't being anything truly creative or original about this movie. <br/><br/>One of the other things that annoyed me about the comedy of this movie was that it kept referencing modern stuff, while this clearly is a movie that is set in ice age. I know, I shouldn't take it all so seriously and I know it's just a movie and it's all for laughs and giggles but I just couldn't help but to be annoyed by it. Perhaps I have just seen too many animated movies that keep on doing this sort of stuff. Again, if only the movie was a bit more creative and original with some of its stuff, it would had made this such a better and far more pleasant watch.<br/><br/>The movie definitely has far too many different characters in it. What the movie could had used was one good and clear main character but instead we now have a whole bunch of them, constantly competing for screen time. And the movie just keeps on introducing new characters! The movie never manages to find a right balance between all of its different characters and their separate story lines.<br/><br/>And it also really doesn't have a very strong villain in it either. As great as Peter Dinklage is, he just isn't a very good villain, since he doesn't really seem to have a good motivation or a devious plan to let him take over the world or destroy it, or anything like that. He is just being evil for the sake of being evil.<br/><br/>And of course there is being an obligatory love story, that really doesn't work out at all and simply should had been left out of the movie. That way we also wouldn't had had Jennifer Lopez in this movie! I don't know what it is but I'm completely fed up with hearing Jennifer Lopez' voice, that just isn't made for acting roles.<br/><br/>Can't say many bad things about the animation. It's funny, I still mostly have the first movie in my mind, which most definitely wasn't the best looking animated movie. This movie however is just as good looking as any other modern computer animated movie. It's not better looking than any other modern genre movie but also most definitely not any worse.<br/><br/>But really, the more I am thinking about this movie, the less I am liking it. I was actually at first going to rate it a 6 because I thought that it served it's purpose well enough, as a kids movie. However, there is just no excuse for the lack of true creativity and originality and we really shouldn't let these type of movies get away with that! Animated movies always need to keep pushing the envelope, not just animation-wise, or else it becomes just another genre that has reached its peak and is on its way down. This movie just feels like lazy filmmaking and just a way to cash in some more on a successful franchise and to sell even some more new toys and other merchandise. I say; no more! Unless they start coming up with something truly great, fun and original again.<br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"michaelthepichael","7","3","7","29 June 2012"," This drifter shows there's still life in this frozen franchise!
","Although I did enjoy Ice Age: Dawn Of The Dinosaurs more then Ice Age: The Meltdown, I was worried that the franchise was beginning to settle into bland territory. However, the commercials and trailer looked good, and as a huge fan of all animation, I didn't hesitate to see it on opening day.<br/><br/>And it was a fun movie. That's all I realistically wanted, and that's what I got.<br/><br/>Following the last movie, life has mostly settled down yet again for our Ice Age heroes. Manny is over protective of his teenage daughter Peaches, not letting her do anything for fear of her growing up too fast. Sid's family who abandoned him off-screen in the first Ice Age briefly return, only to dump his grouchy Granny on him and flee. All goes amiss when Manny, Diego and Sid get stranded on a ice floe and float out to sea, while those left behind move to flee the moving continental plates. Although Manny, Sid, Diego (and Granny, a stowaway who slept through a storm) brave a lot, they meet their match in a group of rugged pirates, led by the fearsome Captain Gutt. He tries being fake-nice to get them to join his crew, but when their escape attempt sinks his ship, he grows a taste for vengeance on Manny.<br/><br/>The crew must have realized their character development was bland last time around, as it's virtually non-existent this time, and it makes little effort to hide this fact In all three character's cases, they have a different attitude or position at the film's end then the start, but no arc, just a poorly written jump. Then again, not all animated films can be high art, and it wasn't like I was expecting any from it anyway. The movie also manages to mostly avoid the sluggish pacing of The Meltdown and the occasionally boring pace of Dawn Of The Dinosaurs by having several plots taking place, mostly that of the main characters and one about Peaches and fitting in back at the mainland. Hers is amusing enough, aided by a crucial new character in her mole friend Louis, who harbors feelings for her, but is just as afraid of rejection as she is of not being allowed to do what she wants.<br/><br/>Sid's Granny provides good laughs, even though's she no Buck (don't blink or you'll miss his cameo). Crash and Eddie do very little this time around, and even Ellie doesn't get much to do. But the film doesn't feel as bogged down that way. Scrat is as amusing as ever, and although a few of his antics here recall The Meltdown, he is still guaranteed to amuse all endlessly. In fact, his final fate may be his cruelest ending at the end of a Ice Age movie yet.<br/><br/>The pirates are a amusing bunch. Laughs come from the fat, ignorant 400-pound seal Flynn, and I also found skull-patterned badger Gupta amusing despite only a few lines. Shira's interesting enough, if only for wounding Diego's pride on many occasions. The rest of the crew are pretty forgettable, although they do their job.<br/><br/>Captain Gutt is without a doubt the best villain in the series though. More clever then Soto, more menacing then the carnivorous sea creatures from The Meltdown and way more memorable then the sluggish Rudy, he is just an all-around baddie. He almost approaches some of the great Disney villains. He isn't upfront about his badness straight away, only wanting Manny, Diego and Sid for his crew. He loses his humor when they foil his plans - twice - leading him to seek hard revenge. He's animated and voiced very well too. The climatic battle between him and Manny was particularly gripping.<br/><br/>The animation is again a step up from Dawn Of The Dinosaurs. Not Pixar, but doing the job greatly, particularly in Scrat's case and with Gutt. It retains that CGI-cartoon look that audiences seem to love. And I liked it too.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not perfect. Half of the pirates, particularly a silent boar, were faceless enemies. Diego's subplot was poorly resolved, there are still some corny lines in the movie, and the plot, while taking a few surprise twists, is still somewhat linear. But the dated pop-culture jokes and innuendos are toned back, the adventure focused on more, the gags somewhat more refined, and the pacing not as sluggish. It makes for a somewhat time at the movies. As Madagascar 3 and Brave haven't been released here yet, I have no recent choices to compare it to, but I enjoyed it. Go see Ice Age: Continental Drift.<br/><br/>Preceding it is a 4-minute Simpsons short, The Longest Daycare, starring Maggie Simpson. A spoof of silent shorts and films to an extent, this was also enjoyable, amusing and fresh, easily the best Maggie's had in the Simpsons for a while now. It added to my overall enjoyment of the feature."
"jordan-maxwell","1","5","15","1 July 2012"," I think they're getting desperate now..
","I saw this film yesterday, and in my opinion it was probably the 3rd best of the Ice Age films (with Dawn of the Dinosaurs no1) although the more i think about it, it could be the weakest of the series. Just to keep in mind I only give it a 1 star for how I felt disappointed as I feel the writers have tried too hard to make this work but the result was not up to the standard of the previous Ice Age movies . Sorry for anyone who disagrees. But let me start from the beginning.<br/><br/>It starts off with Scrap breaking the earth up with his nut which causes the continents to split up. Wow it seems when they're are no ideas it's Scrap who conveniently manages to create a story to work on (I'm not saying i dislike Scrap I just think the writers have started to overuse him, like in Ice Age-The Meltdown Scrap conveniently saves everyone by accident). Anyway, after the ice breaks up it then again conveniently breaks up right between Manny and his daughter Peaches (who is now like a teenager which I don't think works) and Ellie. Which leaves Sid Manny and Diego floating on an ice sheet out to sea. while Ellie,Peaches and everyone else is left on land. <br/><br/>Oh i forgot to mention Sid's parents return and dump his grandmother on Sid who is with the gang on the Ice Sheet. Although she didn't have all the lines she did prove to be the cause of a few laughs in the cinema and was quite a good addition to the gang. Next the ice sheet encounters Pirates where they commander Manny's Sids and Diegos 'ship' and take them as prisoners but almost instantly they break free and destroy the ship, although there is one ice sheet big enough for Manny, Diego Sid and his grandmother. Oh and also for female Sabertooth tiger who was part of the crew, I wonder what will happen there?<br/><br/>So when they were prisoners the crew say the way to get home is by a current on some island where Manny heads to on the ice. They reach there and find the pirates building another ship to try and find Manny, Diego and Sid. However, Diego, Sid and Manny take the ship with the help of these chipmunks. At one point I thought we were watching Alvin and the Chipmunks 3 or something? Anyway, the gang head home, but find Ellie and Peaches being held hostage by the Pirates who made another Ice Ship? *slaps forehead* So, you can see where this is going, Manny an the the Captain fight but what saves the day is Sids Granny who made a pet whale along the trip who tries to help them and helps fight the pirates, seriously? So after Granny's whale saves the day, everyone lives in happiness with the female tiger becoming part of the herd along with granny, i'm thinking the herd couldn't get any bigger. It's going to far. <br/><br/>There are too many subplots to start, I mean the subplot with Peaches is exactly the same as all the other teen stories. Girl mammoth likes good looking mammoth while 'good friend' the mole likes the Girl. Girl becomes one of them and says 'i don't like the mole', mole overhears and gets upset. Girl regrets and realises she likes who she was and not what the cool people want her to be, and that she had happiness all along. *again slaps forehead which is now bruising*. <br/><br/>Also, there's the subplot of the girl tiger who regrets being a pirate and wants to become good, blah blah blah. Oh and scraps story of trying to find 'Scraplantis' which is good as always with Scrap. But everything was to coincidental, cheesy and mixed for me. <br/><br/>There were some funny one liners but if you plan to watch this film for the story or the fact you liked the previous Ice Age like me, then don't. I know you will anyway out of curiosity but it kind of leaves the series on a low note. The writers should stop now as you can only milk a franchise for so long it becomes dull. It happened with Shrek 4, Pirates of the Caribbean 4, Indiana Jones4 and now Ice Age 4. Disappointing film for a great franchise."

A few of the subplots were educational as well as exploring the values of friendship,loyalty and the like which is probably standard fare for these types of films.

"snowspirit7","4","0","0","2 April 2014"," A cheesy, disappointing end to a truly brilliant movie series
","Very disappointing. I've watched every single Ice Age movie in the cinemas, known the stories backwards, grew up with these characters. The end to the 3rd movie felt completed, like a brilliant trilogy had come to an end. Why, oh why did they feel the need to make another one? Oh, I forgot, the very reason why most films are made these days - money. This movie is a cheap money grabber with good animation. The story was bland and predictable, brilliantly written characters from previous films are given absolutely no character development, barely any good dialog and not nearly as much screen time as they deserve. Instead we are presented with new characters like: Peaches, Manny and Ellie's daughter who is a 'rebellious teen who no one understands', the guy she has a crush on who gets way more screen time than he should because he's voiced by someone famous, other teen mammoths who...have no names and no personality but are also voiced by famous people! There's also an actual villain. Ugh. One of the best things about the Ice Age movies is how they handled villains. They were never main characters - because the story was about Manny, Diego and Sid - but they were cleverly written with brilliant dialog and interesting motives. In this movie we get : a large, pirate monkey. With no motives besides 'being evil' - and not even being epically evil or maliciously evil, just annoying and stupid - this character has no interesting dialog, has no point besides 'being the bad guy' and overall is a stupid, useless, not thought-out, pathetic excuse for a villain and for a character. The only two new characters out of the many, many, many of them (who are introduced for a scene and then are never seen again) are Peaches rodent friend and J- Lo's tiger. Unfortunately they have so little screen time I can't even remember their names. The story is predictable, boring, filled with waaayyy too many plot holes and a disgrace to the other well thought out, interesting and unique plots the other Ice Age movies had. I keep comparing this movie to the other Ice Age films, but even on its own this movie is terrible. There was NO MORALE TO THE STORY. One of the biggest reasons for children's movies is to teach morales or lessons in unique ways. Though a few minor characters redeem themselves, the main characters learn NOTHING. It's pathetic. They used up every single humorous piece of dialog during the ads, so when you went to watch the movie nothing was funny. I guess that served the purpose though, get audiences to the movies to MAKE MONEY! The new characters are terrible, old characters are forgotten about, story is awful, so what was good about this film? Animation. Yes, the animation was nice. Not as brilliant as, say, Disney or Pixar, but still impressive (especially with all the water scenes). The end credits song is good (though was written to show how many famous people were involved with the cast). Basically this movie is a sorry excuse for an end to a brilliant set of movies. Blue Sky studios, please feel ashamed. You made a movie in which you took some of the most beloved childhood characters and did nothing with them, wrote a bunch of pointless other characters, a stupid story and then MADE A BUNCH OF MONEY!"

","I am a huge fan of the first Ice Age movie. It made me cry. You might say that this was an unnecessary sequel but having said that it's just great fun for both the adults and the kids. This is the fourth frosty installment of the popular Dream Works series, and I do have to say that although this is so far, the weakest of the movies, the simplicity and the comedy are still great to watch. Yes OK I know that maybe some of the gags are running dry, and some critics have said Ice Age has had it's day, but it's still really top notch family entertainment and what more can you ask for? I really loved it and so did my kids. Who doesn't love a woolly mammoth? Plus there are decent morals thrown in to the plot.

","Since the first Ice Age debuted in 2002, there now have been three sequels with this film, Continental Drift being the third one. Despite the poor reviews, I enjoyed this film. I have been a fan of the series since it originally came out and while not having the magic of the first film, it still has the charms, zany characters, themes of friendship/family, good animation, and the comedy that we have come to love from Manny, Sid, and Diego.<br/><br/>This film reunites our favorite heroes as the land they know begins to break up and create problems for everyone. Manny and the gang are separated from his wife and daughter and while trying to get back to them, they are captured by a group of pirates bent on making their lives miserable.<br/><br/>This voice cast still boasts an impeccable voice cast led by our favorites: Ray Romano, Denis Leary, and John Leguizamo. Queen Latifah does solid voice work as well. On the other hand, Nicky Minaj was in this movie and all I can say is....ugh.<br/><br/>Overall, Ice Age: Continental Drift is still an entertaining adventure even though I fear it may be losing some mojo. Children will definitely enjoy this and so will fans of the series. It has crisp animation, silly comedy, and also a few good songs such as that one called, ""We Are Family."" That is a perfect title for a film that relies on friendship and family bonding. I rate this film 9/10."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","0","10 November 2013"," Really not that bad
","I'm not exactly sure, if it should be taken into consideration when evaluating this movie that it's already the fourth entry in the series and of course not that fresh and innovative anymore. They certainly made the most of it taken that into consideration. But it's not really that bad that you have to look for excuses or mitigating factors. Ice Age 4 is still a solid film I wouldn't hesitate to show my children. The first half is rather weak and had me occasionally lost interest, but the fact that I never stop watching a film before it actually ends was rewarded here and the second half was actually pretty good, definitely an improvement. The whole continental drift story is pretty forgettable and really only just the frame for the characters and their interactions.<br/><br/>We have a muscular scary monkey here as the main antagonist (voiced by ""Game of Thrones""-star Peter Dinklage) who leads a gang of pirates. Otherwise pretty much all the characters from the last three films are included and if you loved them there, chances are good you will also enjoy them here. In addition, there's a female saber-toothed tiger with the most predictable, but nonetheless sweet, storyline. Still, it's fun. Scrat is included again as well and while I never was a fan of him at all, I have to admit I enjoyed the part near the end when he gets to ""Scratlantis"" to the tune of the wonderful ""Freude schöner Götterfunken"", maybe my favorite inclusion of Scrat in the whole franchise. I'd need to watch the other films again to make a definite decision.<br/><br/>The film itself seems to focus on father-daughter issues judging from the beginning, but I personally enjoyed the unusual friendship story involving said daughter and the hedgehog(?) more captivating and moving. It was the highlight of these 90 minutes. Comedy-wise you can't really top a paralyzed Sid (that's what you get for being such a glutton!). The animation is fine as you'd expect it, especially when it comes to the characters. Really it's almost impossible to find a film these days where the animation is amateurish enough to hurt the overall image of a movie. It's all just about different styles and you have to find your own favorite approach. Occasionally it's even fine enough to bring up some really cute scenes, for example all those scenes that involve the hyraces.<br/><br/>Directors Steve Martino and Mike Thurmeier have worked among other things on the Scrat short films in the past and they've managed to add a worthy fourth film to the series. I watched the first three films a couple years ago and I wouldn't say that this one is inferior to them in quality at all. That's why I'd recommend it, especially to fans of the first three and to children and animation lovers of all ages."

","Ice Age 4 was obvious to arrive after Ice Age 3 was accepted universally as the funniest in the series. But that's where the problem starts. Ice Age 4 is adventurous like its predecessors but not funny like Ice Age 3 nor subtle like Ice Age 1. Most of the new characters fall flat and most of the situations are pretty predictable and pinch like clichés. It's not like everything was bad. Granny character was funny and complimented our adorable and crazy Sid. There are fun moments too but only here and there. It felt like the lead characters are getting tired of these adventures so is the loyal audience. Even the most liked character Scratte did not have enough fun this time. If they are thinking on Ice Age 5, I just hope they reinvent the series with some original idea."

","As is the fashion these days with these films there is a lot of moralising going on and a lot about the importance of family. I don't usually have a problem with this, but in this film it was so 'in your face' that I felt it got in the way of the story. I didn't enjoy this one as much as the other 'Ice Age' films, probably because it has lost all the charm the characters had in the earlier films. On the plus side, Peter Dinklage did make for a very intimidating and threatening advocacy. I guess it wasn't until about the last 20 minutes that I began to warm to any of the characters, but by then it was far too late. Time to put the franchise to rest guys.

"japamo","8","0","0","24 June 2013"," Latest Ice Age ""Odyssey"" Proves the Franchise Still Has Legs - to Some Degree
","Ice Age 4 - Continental Drift"" (hereafter IA4) is an ideal example of what I like to call ""Cinematic Dissonance"". I define Cinematic Dissonance as the sensation when, watching a movie, your brain is telling you ""This is really silly and/or stupid!"" but your emotions are telling you ""I'm having a great time!"". Therefore, I can understand and even somewhat agree with the 1- and 2-star reviewers of this movie who complain that IA4 is basically more of the hackneyed, predictable, improbable, and homogenized capers of Manny the Mammoth (Ray Romano) and company. And yet, I side with the 3- and 4-star reviewers who enjoyed IA4 as an energetic, dynamic, funny seagoing adventure with allusions to Homer's ""The Odyssey"" that somehow still reinforces the themes of family, adolescent angst, loyalty, self-sacrifice, and home.<br/><br/>With each succeeding ""Ice Age"" movie, logic and natural reality have been left further and further behind. For example, by now, to appreciate the franchise, you have to accept that Scrat the obsessed saber-toothed squirrel's acorn pursuit will lead to more and more global catastrophic changes. In IA4, he has caused the surprisingly fragile Pangea's fragmentation into the continents we know today. We also have to accept that Manny is obstinately determined to keep his now-teenaged daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) safe, when actually male elephants hardly take part in raising offspring, and that Peaches' best friend is a mole/hedgehog (""molehog"") hybrid named Louis. Of course, Peaches has also inherited her prehensile tail and tree-living abilities from her mother, Ellie (Queen Latifah). The only other complication in our gang's essentially stable lives is the sudden abandonment of feisty Granny Sloth (Wanda Sykes) to Sid's (John Leguizamo's) care by his fly-by-night family. Granny has a friend called ""Precious"", but it's certainly not a ring. Hey, these are familiar domestic dramas, but IA4 still makes them interesting.<br/><br/>But the continental shiftings and movements interrupt the drama and gradually separate Manny, Sid, Granny, and Diego the sensible sabertooth cat (Denis Leary) from the others. Set adrift on an iceberg, Manny and friends encounter another iceberg - a ""pirate ship"" commanded by a Gigantopithecus (according to Wikipedia) named Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) and his zoo crew - including a blubbery elephant seal, a rabbit, a kangaroo, and an able-bodied first-mate female Smilodon named Shira. So now the plot is established with several resolutions to be made: 1) Can Manny and his crew escape Captain Gutt's grasp? 2) Will Shira mutiny and change alliances? 3) Can Manny and his crew weather turbulent seas, fierce narwhals, and even (!) sirens to get back home, AND save a kidnapped Peaches and Ellie?, 4) Can Manny defeat Captain Gutt in battle? 5) Can klutzy Sid get along with his grandma and be a hero, 6) Can insecure Louis help save his friends, and finally 6) Is Precious real, or just Granny's hallucination? Oohwee! I think you know how all the above resolutions will play out. Even so, I enjoyed them because I felt that all of IA4's characters were cheerfully giving their utmost to entertain us and having a grand time doing so. Besides the vivacious characterizations, IA4 continues the breathtakingly solid and weighty photorealism of its backgrounds and animation. Most importantly, IA4 continues to resist the self-consciousness of acting in a madcap, surreal story. The characters believed in the story and told it well, and made me believe it, too.<br/><br/>P.S.: One other resolution - Scrat finds a treasure map that leads him to a legendary acorn paradise called ""Scratlantis"". Does Scrat find the acorn of his dreams? Wellll,.....<br/><br/>P.P.S.: By the way, Gigantopithecuses really did exist about 1 million years ago. They were huge apes over 10 feet tall. Therefore, it is quite plausible that Captain Gutt could fight and even toss around Manny."

","Ice Age 4: Continental Drift is the latest installment into Blue Sky Studio's big franchise. It's about how the continents of the Earth drift into their own directions, and all this affects our main characters. Is this movie as good as any of the previous movies, maybe even the first? Or does it fall into the typical third sequel-category?<br/><br/>I had fun watching Ice Age 4. That's mainly because I have so many great memories from watching the first Ice Age movie. I did not watch the second movie until I was much older, and the third movie is obviously not old enough for me to have grown up with. But anyway, I really like the first movie, and I think it's definitely one of the best animated movies not done by Disney, Pixar or DreamWorks. The second movie was good, but not as great. Same goes for the third one, which did try something new with a brand new environment and story, which I liked. But this fourth goes back to the traditional Ice Age style.<br/><br/>As I stated, the reason I really liked this one was because of the nostalgia. It was fun seeing some of my favorite animated characters back on the big screen again (the first movie is actually the first movie I saw in theaters). I enjoyed the humor (some of the jokes fell flat, but it was overall funny), and as I said, I enjoyed the characters. One of the things I didn't care about, however, was the story...<br/><br/>The story is the same as Ice Age 2, only dumped down. It's the same ""the environment is becoming dangerous to live in, so we gotta move in packs to a safe location before the time is out""-concept that was used in Ice Age 2. The only differences is that the three main characters are separated from the pack, and that the movie would include some elements such as pirate villains and of course the continental drift concept.<br/><br/>Another problem with the movie is that it had some terrible musical numbers. One is to introduce the main villain (which by the way, I didn't like at all), which is a cliché opera-style villain theme that's been used in multiple Disney movies. And then there's a credits song, that's just the worst thing ever. I have never heard something this embarrassing in the theatre all year!<br/><br/>Overall, Ice Age 4: Continental Drift is hugely flawed, but still enjoyable if you like the previous movies in the series, especially Ice Age 2. With the same memorable characters from the previous installments, some very nice-looking animation and scenery and funny moments, this is a movie that parent should consider taking their kid(s) to."

Oh, and seeing Scrat always going after that acorn, among many, in a separate subplot doesn't get old, still. Really, you can't go wrong with the voices of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Leary along with that of Queen Latifah, Jennifer Lopez, and especially Wanda Sykes, among others, doing those characters.

","KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Cheyenne Nguyen (age 8) shares her review with us: Video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo2HlKUQgiY<br/><br/>This movie is an adventure and comedy animation. Ice Age 4 picks up where Scrat still did not catch that acorn and the results of his chasing after the acorn that made the continent drift apart. The story is about Manny (Ray Romano), an over protective father who tries to keep his teenage daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) from hanging out with the bad group of mammoths. Peaches is desperate to prove that she is cool so she can hang out with the cool kids. Manny and his daughter have a fight in front of her friends and the last thing Peaches says to her father is ""I wish you were not my father"". This is when the earth shakes; Manny, Diego and Sid are separated from the rest of the pack. They encounter ice pirates and many different sea creatures. They all are home sick and want to find a way home. However, the ice pirate wanted to capture them as prisoners. Manny and his gang have to come up with a plan to escape from the pirates and use his ice ship to go home. This movie has a lot of jokes that made me laugh throughout the movie. The love story between Diego and the white tiger Shira (voice by Jennifer Lopez) is so cute. The 3D is totally awesome. The message of this movie is about the importance of family and how we do not have a choice picking who is in our family. My favorite character in this movie is Granny. Everything about her is funny and unpredictable. One thing that I did not like is that there are too many new characters. Also, I would like to see more of Granny. I rank this movie 5 out of 5 stars because it's exciting, funny and all the characters are so strong and different. I recommend this movie for ages 3 to 18"

","Blue Sky Studios has always been under the shadow of Pixar and DreamWorks, but the ""Ice Age"" series has been popular with families the world over, and so the fourth movie of this lucrative franchise has arrived in the form of Ice Age: Continental Drift After another misadventure with his nut, Scrat falls to the centre of the Earth (without the pressure and heat killing him) and accidentally breaks the world into the continents we know today, which ends up affecting our main protagonists. Manny the Mammoth (Ray Romano) is now an over-protective father to his teenage daughter, Peaches (Keke Palmer) who has fallen for a boy, Ethan (Drake). Sid's (John Leguizamo) family also returns just so they can dump his insane grandmother, Granny (Wanda Sykes) on him, and Diego the Sabre-toothed Cat (Denis Leary) is involved because, eh  because.<br/><br/>When the continents split Manny, Sid, Diego and Granny are trapped on an iceberg and end up crossing the vicious pirate Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) and his motley crew. While at home, Ellie (Queen Latifah) and Peaches have to lead the animals to safety as Manny tries to make his way back.<br/><br/>The ""Ice Age"" series has always been a safe series; it offers nothing groundbreaking, and ""Continental Drift"" continues down this route. ""Continental Drift"" is formulaic and predictable and you can see how plot points will play out from a mile off. But this film will not make children dumber and they are not talked down to. There are worse family movies and children are smart enough to know the ""Ice Age"" series is not a science or history lesson.<br/><br/>The jokes throughout are hit and miss, some working better then others. Being kid friendly, the humour is mostly physical, namely slapstick, and occasionally there are witty lines, mainly from Leary and Romano. Scrat still provides a lot of silent humour and he is a lovable, old-fashioned cartoon character.<br/><br/>There are plenty of new additions who would properly return for sequels such as Peaches, Shira (another sabre-toothed cat voiced by Jennifer Lopez) and Granny, but the main characters sometimes felt underused in the franchise they helped build. Diego is given a romantic sub-plot but generally does not do much in the proceedings. Sid too was overshadowed because of the huge amount of comic relief characters, and his material was not funny enough. Dinklage of Game of Thrones fame was a stand-out performer, playing a straight pirate with a lot menace, while Nick Frost was very funny as an extremely stupid elephant seal.<br/><br/>""Continental Drift"" is a movie filled with an all star cast, which raises the questions, were they all needed? Was Heather Morris from Glee really offering anything as a teenage mammoth in a really tiny role, or Seann William Scott and Josh Peck used to their fullest? ""Continental Drift"" is also a movie overloaded with plots. There is Manny and co. trying to get back to their herd while being chased by Captain Gutt, Diego's love-hate relationship with Shira, and Ellie leading the herd as a awkward, geeky teenager trying to impress a boy and his ""cool"" friends in a clichéd story.

"Chris_Pandolfi","7","0","0","13 July 2012"," What Else is Left? Extinction?
","Late 2010 saw the theatrical release of ""Scrat's Continental Crack-Up,"" an animated short in which Scrat, the prehistoric squirrel from the ""Ice Age"" films, instigated instantaneous continental drift when attempting to bury his long sought-after acorn in an ice shelf. I saw this short many times, never once thinking that it would end up being the opening scene of ""Ice Age: Continental Drift,"" the fourth chapter of the series. It's as silly as silly can be, Scrat literally falling straight down to the Earth's core and, by the simple act of trying to chase down his acorn, spins the core to such a velocity that it makes the land masses on the surface crack into the continental shapes we know today. When he's flung to the surface like a furry rubber band, Scrat soars through the air before landing painfully on a tiny iceberg. And so begins a new series of acorn-related misadventures.<br/><br/>It's funny that I would end up enjoying ""Continental Drift,"" especially after my rather indignant reaction to the previous ""Ice Age"" installment, ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs."" Some readers wondered how I could possibly find fault with the idea that a dinosaur somehow survived extinction and lived in an underground cave; they tried to reason that it was just a cartoon and not meant to be taken too seriously. Perhaps they were right, but I knew how I felt at the time, and I know how I feel now, and the simple fact is I liked this new movie better than its predecessor. It's by no means perfect, but as a family-friendly animated adventure, it gets the job done. It has plenty of laughs, lots of heart, a good cast, some great visuals, and even a few instances in which the 3D process stands out. They're all gimmicky, but at least they're noticeable.<br/><br/>Along with Scrat, Manny the wooly mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo), and Diego the saber-tooth tiger (voiced by Denis Leary) all return, as do Manny's wife Ellie (voiced by Queen Latifah) and her possum brothers Crash and Eddie (voiced by Seann William Scott and Josh Peck). New to this film is a now teenage version of Manny and Ellie's daughter, Peaches (voiced by Keke Palmer), who desperately wants a break from her father's overprotective instincts, and Sid's grandmother (voiced by Wanda Sykes), a feisty old woman who keeps calling out to a pet named Precious. Everyone assumes that Precious has either long since died or never existed to begin with. She's unceremoniously dumped into Manny's care by his family, who hasn't seen him in years. They have getting rid of burdensome relatives down to a simple formula: Drop them off and run like hell.<br/><br/>The plot involves the crumbling continent separating Manny, Sid, Diego, and Granny from Ellie and Peaches. The first four float on an iceberg into the middle of the ocean, hoping they can somehow paddle their way back to the continent. After narrowly surviving a freak storm complete with a monstrous waterspout, they're attacked by a pirate ship – or, more accurately, a pirate iceberg – captained by the cold-hearted Gutt (voiced by Peter Dinklage), a prehistoric ape creature with incredibly bad teeth. His first mate is a saber-tooth cat named Shira (voiced by Jennifer Lopez), whose status as a female counterpart to Diego should tell you just about everything you need to know. Manny and his friends will also have a brief encounter with sirens (which in their natural form look like the squat lovechildren of the Creature from the Black Lagoon) and a tribe of hyraxes (whose language sounds uncannily like a mix between Jawa and Ewok).<br/><br/>Ellie and Peaches, meanwhile, are busy herding the remaining animals towards a distant land bridge, for a continental shelf is rapidly moving in their direction, destroying everything in its path. During this time, Peaches attempts to work through her feelings of guilt, as the last conversation she had with her father was an argument. She also tries to impress Ethan, the wooly mammoth she has a crush on (voiced by Drake), by pretending to dump her best friend, a molehog named Louis, whom everyone has nicknamed Weiner (voiced by Josh Gad). This aspect of the plot is good-natured, but it's also unquestionably the most familiar and predictable. No doubt Peaches will learn a lesson or two by the time the movie ends.<br/><br/>Having covered the major geographical and meteorological epochs of Earth's history – the last ice age, the melting of the glaciers, and now continental drift (the latter proving that the filmmakers aren't much interested in chronology) – I'm forced to wonder what avenues are left to travel for any potential ""Ice Age"" sequels. Surely no one would dare to depict the eventual demise of the wooly mammoth and the saber-tooth tiger. Then again, maybe someone actually would dare, as evidenced by a scene near the end of ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" in which Peaches argues with Ethan and his posse: ""If you geniuses are normal,"" she yells, ""this species is gonna end up extinct!"" Given the fact that it really did end up extinct, I honestly don't know how funny that line is. Strange, how death on such a massive scale can dampen one's sense of humor.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"

","Run of the mill story – Excellent animation Top class animation doesn't make up for a weak storyline in the latest Ice Age movie but it probably won't matter to the makers. After all it's the fourth movie in the series so they must be doing something right.<br/><br/>There are big names doing the voices, Denis Leary, Ray Romano, Queen Latifah, Sean William Scott and even J-Lo! So the budget must have been pretty big and the producers must be confident of still making a profit.<br/><br/>The story involves the characters we are familiar from for the previous movies being separated, as the tectonic plates start shifting suddenly. Will they all be reunited? You'll never guess! One part of the gang meets a band of pirates on their travels and this makes it harder for them to reunite with the others.

","I have been a huge fan of the ICE AGE series during my childhood they were funny, emotional, and filled with moments you'll never forget. Till now! The first Ice Age was absolutely the best of the franchise, i loved it nothing like the beginning of the most funniest herd come together.<br/><br/>The second film was OK but not as good as the first but it was just as funny. To me, the story was good and all however the new CGI they used made the characters a bit brighter and somewhat dull in color they didn't look the same as they did in the first.<br/><br/>Ice Age 3 was my personal favorite. The CGI was improved by a lot, the characters looked better and so much funnier than the second but the underground world thing was cheesy instead of being on the surface. Buck the weasel was a fantastic addition to the cast, he was funny, crazy, and totally awesome too bad he stayed below though :( Manny and Ellie's daughter was born named peaches just a tiny mammoth and a moment never to forget.<br/><br/>OK now for number 4 ... First off, the story went way, way too fast. little peaches, is now 19 years old (talk about a big story gap)the story begins as scrat splitting a mountain with his acorn causing the continents divide leaving Manny, Diego and Sid floating on an iceberg trying to get home while fighting pirates. Too me, this movie was mainly about teenage drama, peaches loving Ethan and Steffie loving him too and louis loving peaches just fighting over each other.<br/><br/>The story was too confusing because of that and it was telling other stories instead of focusing on the main plot. crash and Eddie was only in three scenes and Diego's girlfriend wasn't in the movie much either. The character development was falling apart. There were way too many new characters in the film that hardly anybody was shown. I really do not like the new family they have now, Niki minaj, and drake as teenage mammoths that pretty much ruined the film with their drama.<br/><br/>All i can say is, this movie was bad, i will not be looking forward to getting the blu ray. This franchise was better off as a trilogy, the fourth one just doesn't fit. However, i did like Granny she was the funniest of the whole movie and deserves to be part of the herd and i did see Buck at the beginning for two seconds, he should have been in it more so he can save this movie.<br/><br/>I do see a fifth film coming and may be the last the way this movie ended at a small island, what could possibly happen there. Im hoping it would be a big family reunion bringing all of our favorite characters from the past films come together one last time."

What I really liked about Ice Age 4: Continental Drift is the repeated theme of family and loving one another no matter what, which is a great message for all ages and the movie delivers it without being preachy. And even though it's not as funny as the previous three movies (due to there being more dramatic elements, which made me feel for the characters more), there are still plenty laughs to be had.<br/><br/>Now for the (very minor) flaws:<br/><br/>1.> The teenage mammoth characters (voiced by rap/R&B singers Drake and Nicki Minaj and ""Glee's"" Heather Morris) are completely annoying and useless, and they drag the movie down a bit.<br/><br/>2.> The relationship/romance between Diego (Leary) and Shira (singer/actress/""American Idol"" judge Jennifer Lopez) didn't get much screen time or development.<br/><br/>3.> The scenes with Scrat weren't as funny this time around, probably because he's been overused, but he does get less screen time compared to the first two movies.<br/><br/>4.> Overall the movie tried to cram too much into too little time.<br/><br/>Overall Ice Age 4: Continental Drift is a really good movie, you won't regret seeing it.<br/><br/>Now please bring on Ice Age 5!!!!!!"
"reneemsm","6","2","5","15 July 2012"," Time for them to stop
","Today it was supposed to rain so my husband and I took the kids to a double feature. We saw Brave (our second time b/c it's SOOOO awesome!!!!) and Ice Age 4.<br/><br/>Before the movie there was a Simpsons cartoon (trying to copy Pixar, I assume). It was probably the most absurd thing I've seen in awhile. First of all, clearly the person who created it was of very low intelligence because they called the daycare the Ayn Rand daycare but it ended up being really fascist in nature (scanning all the kids and having armed guards everywhere, etc). All it takes is 2 minutes of googling or reading 1 of her books (or 1 of her quotes if you're too stupid to get through a full book) to know that Ayn Rand was STRONGLY against things like that. In fact, things like that are what made her escape to America . So my husband and I were just really confused through that whole mess. Probably because we aren't morons...<br/><br/>Then the movie started. It was fine for the kids (ours are 3, 5 and 7) esp if they like slapstick comedy stuff (as most kids do). Some things went over our kids heads but they got most of it. It was basically Pirates of the Carribbean meets 2012 (or any other apocalyptic movie). The kids laughed maybe 5-7 times and my husband and I laughed about 3-5 times. It was fine but really not worth going to the theater for it (and certainly not worth paying $5 more for 3D...which we didn't, thankfully). It honestly felt like a made for TV movie. So hopefully if they continue on with this series (Dear God I hope not) they just send it straight to TV. The first 2 were cute and funny, but the last 2...not so much."
"photo20081254","10","2","5","14 July 2012"," Hilarious and great ending to the Ice Age Series
","I thought the movie was hilarious and a great ending to the Ice Age movies. It's nice to watch a movie that is just meant to be funny. Sometimes it gets tiring to go to the movies and continue to watch movie after movie that has some ""lesson"" or ""meaning"" that we are suppose to take away to apply in real life. The Ice Age movies from the very beginning have all had the same meaning of ""Sticking together and have each other's back and that a group of different people can come together to be a family or herd"".It's nice to sit there to just enjoy the movie, see how the characters have grown, new characters have come into play, have a lot of hilarious moments, and to see in the end they all end up together and happy even after all the obstacles they faced together. By far this is the best movie out of the Ice Age movies and I would definitely recommend families to go take their kids to watch it or if you have just simply been keeping up with the movies since they started."
"blogurious","4","2","5","6 July 2012"," The ice is no longer cold
","Three years ago I believed the Ice Age trilogy had taken its final step and the results were not so compelling as the first two installments. Nevertheless, it was fun to see the characters back together for a possible closure. <br/><br/>""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" seems to be forcing the story a bit too far, taking different directions that do not add much to what we were used to. This time we get stuck in the middle of the ocean while a crazy old monkey incarnates a mean pirate with lots of issues to resolve. The adventure, however, is a bit dull and in spite of the 3D effects, I couldn't feel the connection that I had with the two first installments. I was almost sure it should have stopped after the third part, but after seeing this one, I am now completely sure."
"musanna-ahmed","7","2","5","30 June 2012"," An entertaining addition to the 'age'-ing series.
","To start with - the technical side of filmmaking. The Ice Age series has always excelled in providing amazing visuals and this one doesn't disappoint. The use of 3D is brilliant, almost enough to restore my faith in the dire format, with credit going to the blocking choices for the characters (if that exists in animation) - they are often propelled into situations where the camera angle would turn to have them move towards the camera, creating the intended three-dimensional 'pop out' illusion. To add to the enjoyment of the visual side of the film, the new animals have been pleasingly designed by the animators.<br/><br/>And on an artistic level of filmmaking, the screenplay is unfortunately missing the wit and subtle humour that made the original film hilarious. The comedy is powered by visual gags instead. Some may find this disappointing but with the state of comedy films this modern day that manage to sell, it seems visual gags are what cater nicely to the target audience which is children. However, I give credit to one of the screenwriters, Jason Fuchs, who has helped script a feature film that does manage to entertain at only 24 years old. But when a film works with visual jokes rather than a script for comedy, it doesn't make one too excited about the prospects of the people behind the camera. Maybe the reception of Continental Drift can help Fuchs work on his next piece though. <br/><br/>Satisfying voice acting is featured in the film, I was in fact surprised that Drake and Nicki Minaj performed decently. The show-stealer was Wanda Sykes who voiced Sid's granny - she was an exception to the aforementioned visual/verbal joke argument as her greater comedy asset was undoubtedly her voice. For the record, it was ironic how Peter Dinklage voiced one of the largest pirates.<br/><br/>It's inevitable that the question ""Is it better than it's predecessor(s)?"" will be asked about Continental Drift. Well, whilst none of the sequels have been of the same quality of the original, I choose to only compare this one to the last one and the answer is yes, mainly due to the subtext of the story.<br/><br/>It revolves around the animals getting captured by pirate animals and doing their best to turn the tables on them. This could be interpreted as a message about how us humans, represented here as the animals, are capturing animals for our own self interest without any real sympathy. I'm no animal activist but I can safely say this is a relative approach for the filmmakers to go for - also considering as number three was about dinosaurs which have no relevance this present day - because the amount of environmental groups wanting for us to save these animals is of a large amount and ever-growing animals are becoming abused, unwanted, and abandoned by some of us. So on the socio-political level of filmmaking, Ice Age 4 has a good reason to exist.<br/><br/>All in all, Ice Age: Continental Drift is an entertaining addition to the series. Whilst it still proves that the series could have only gone downhill from the first one, it has a sufficient amount of reasons to be recommended to the target audience, children and fans of the series alike. Plus Scrat is still as entertaining a character as ever.<br/><br/>I will not spoil the ending but can say that it could be looked at as sequel bait but arguably, the series has gone long enough and I predict that a fifth film will really take its toll on it but time shall tell."

"p-stepien","3","1","2","29 December 2012"," Patchy series
","""Ice Age"" out of all the 3D animation franchises boasts the least intriguing characters. Where Madagascar is saved by the militant penguins and King Julien, or Shrek by a certain talking donkeys and a host of fairy tales freakoids, ""Ice Age"" has to fall back on Scrat, who unfortunately has grown stale and repetitive with every new outing. ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" manages to recapture some spirit through Scrat's love affair and the introduction of the swash-buckling weasel Buck. Manny, Diego and co offer limited appeal, mostly functioning as dramatic outlets for plot development, leaving only Sid to be a somewhat colourful, if goofy character.<br/><br/>This time around Scrat is back to his quest for the ever-elusive and ultra-destructive acorn, while Buck makes a blink-of-an-eye appearance. As Manny (Ray Romano) tries to control her hormonally challenged daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer), the earth starts another epic change when continents split. As a consequence Peaches and Ellie (Queen Latifah) are split from Manny, who finds himself adrift in full ocean with the sabretooth Diego (Denis Leary), Sid (John Leguizamo) and the latter's granny (Wanda Sykes). Manny will do anything to return to his family, but in order to do so he must first confront the first sea pirate on Earth: prehistoric ape Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) and his crew of sea-worn misfits.<br/><br/>Despite some new quacky characters like Granny and the inclusion of extremely talented Dinklage, unfortunately the story didn't work for me and the excess of characters meant none were really focused on, as each of them compete for stage time. Overly contrived and lacking pace or charm this lazy instalment of ""Ice Age"" drifts along waiting for end credits, cold in delivery, despite best attempts to warm up the audience (mostly through pretty standard Laurel and Hardy type jokes). Ultimately a sequel too much for what was already a strained idea. By far the least successful of the series, showing that this franchise should be heading for meltdown. Hopefully no more global events await the ""Ice Age"", thus no further stories to be painfully churned out."

It's not just obnoxious, it's boring. The movie is far too content to recycle ideas from the earlier movies. There seems to be no story, and yet too much story. There are way too many characters, and distractingly obvious voice overs without much passion (only Peter Dinklage sounds like he's having any fun). Thankfully, the movie is at least over quickly. Oh, and John Powell arranges the single most schizophrenic version of Beetovhen's ""Ode to Joy"" in existence.<br/><br/>** out of *****"

"TheUnknown837-1","6","1","2","1 August 2012"," ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" is one of the many reasons why I have shied away from going to the movies very often this year
","""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" is one of the many reasons why I have shied away from going to the movies very often this year. It plants itself into the same realms as ""The Grey,"" becoming yet another 2012 release that I was eagerly looking forward to and ended up bitterly disappointed with. This film, the fourth in the popular animated series about talking prehistoric mammals, maintains the superficial elements that made the ""Ice Age"" series good in the beginning—the stellar animation—but does not even bother trying with the rest. I adored the original ""Ice Age"" and enjoyed the second film, ""Ice Age: the Meltdown"" just as much. The third movie, ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,"" was an uninspired bore, and the new film is just barely better. Just barely.<br/><br/>One of my big objections to the third movie was the inclusion of a new character: a child for the two mammoths, Manny and Ellie. My objection was only expanded here. In this new film, their daughter, Peaches, has grown into an adolescent. And like the adolescents we would expect to see in a human-family drama, this character's only motives are disobeying rules, flirting with the boys, and turning on friends for the more 'hip' members of the crowd—or herd, I guess you could say. Anyway, the titular Continental Drift, is caused by none other than Scrat the saber-toothed squirrel, once again planting his acorn in all the wrong places. This time the crack he makes in the earth sends him straight down to the planet's core and causes the continents to split apart. Manny the mammoth, Sid the sloth, and Diego the saber-toothed tiger are swept away on a piece of ice. And here is where the plot becomes insanely strident and uninteresting.<br/><br/>They are captured by pirates.<br/><br/>A group of rogue animals, led by a clawed ape—they break down into a song that stops the movie cold in its tracks—and seconded by a female saber-toothed tiger who Diego takes a mandatory, conventions-forced shine to. This is the second time in which Diego's inner-struggles have been boring and just the most recent of thousands of completely unneeded love interests to penetrate an ongoing film series. Giving Manny a love interest in the second film was almost essential, as it played off a key moment in the original film. But giving Diego, this feisty and hard-as-nails character, a love interest—and the sketchy ways in which they utilize it in the plot—just left me with my hands spread, mouth agape, wondering ""Why?"" However, these are just idiosyncratic gripes for me. What ultimately wrecks ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"" is its breakneck pace. This is a movie that seems all too eager to see itself end. Hence why not one plot element, not one gag, not one character, seems to fulfill its duty or purpose. The story leaps and bounds from one spot to another without even bothering to develop a single idea. A key example: at one point in the movie, the pirates and our heroes find themselves marooned on an island. Our heroes find a tribe of marmot-like critters and persuade them to join forces with them. But the dialogue and storytelling is so rushed that we almost don't realize that the only reason these critters are siding with Manny, Diego, and Sid is because some of their comrades have been taken captive. Why? Because the movie, in previous scenes, did not allow enough time for us to identify which strange animals are pirates. As far as I was concerned, those little animals being whipped and forced to carry loot were veteran members of the crew.<br/><br/>The screenplay has ""desperate"" painted all over it. Popular characters from previous entries, such as the two overly adventurous possum brothers, are reduced to mere cameos, appearing only because it provides better box office appeal that way. There are utterly laugh-less gags such as Peaches the teenage-girl-mammoth snapping back at a friend, ""Ethan is not cute! He's hot!"" The laughs seem to be aimed for the very youngest of moviegoers. When Scrat the squirrel, who is seldom funny at all this time around, falls into the center of the earth, we get a cartoon-colored diagram of the earth to display it. The previous movies did not rely upon 21st century visual gimmicks (stuff a child would see in their homeroom at elementary school) so the audience could get the idea. Obviously because the filmmakers did not trust parents to come with their kids to the theater, thinking that they have grown tired of the series.<br/><br/>Well, they may be right.<br/><br/>I did like this movie a little more than ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" because, and perhaps this goes back to its faster pacing, it did seem to have a better sense of adventure and it did not plod all over the place. It just raced around too much. In spite of my negative review, I will admit that it is a harmless piece of kids-movie entertainment, helped by its 88-minute running time. I was not aggravated or in pain as I watched it, nor was I captivated. This will obviously not be the last of the franchise, and ""Ice Age 5"" or whatever it will be called, will probably be dimmer, shorter, and have less imagination than this one. Sooner or later, they'll be straight to DVD. Remind me next time to stay home when the next one comes out. And frankly, Scrat causing the continents to drift was done better in the ten-minute short ""No Time for Nuts"" and that short was more entertaining than the last two ""Ice Age"" movies combined."

","I brought the family to see this movie last weekend. We have watched, re watched, and practically memorized the previous three Ice Age movies. Although I enjoyed a few good laughs, the newest movie didn't quite meet the high bar set by the previous three movies. There was a boatload of new characters, and a complex plot. Between Peaches and her relationship issues between her dad and her friends, the return of Sid's family, the new threat of the pirates, Diego's new romance, and that increasingly annoying chipmunk... it was just too much. There was no time to think. No time to relax and really absorb everything. I know we will end up buying this movie when it comes out on DVD. It was funny enough, especially with Granny. It was decent, but just didn't compare to its predecessors."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","1","2","22 July 2012"," Ironically, I think the actual ice age was shorter than this franchise
","There is a reason I'm not in the stock market, I'm not sure why some movies continue to get sequels, I never figured they would try to turn Ice Age into a franchise of some sort. The first Ice Age was very cute, nothing special, but enjoyable to watch. The sequels are pretty decent over all, but I never found myself watching them twice. But I guess they were popular enough to spawn another sequel called Continental Drift. So in our quest for a movie weekend, my fiancé and I decided to give this movie a fair chance on it's opening weekend. Over all, it was pretty cute and had it's share of laughs. I do think this was a pick up from the last sequel, but again, it was a movie worthy of a straight to DVD release. The story is predictable and some of the actor's voices just don't work with the characters. However with some new additional characters that were actually pretty funny, I don't find myself unsatisfied with Continental Drift.<br/><br/>Scrat's hunt for acorns triggers the break-up of the Pangaea landmass into the continents as we know them today. In the meantime, Manny and his wife Ellie deal with their teenage daughter Peaches. Sid's family, appear to have been looking for him, but it is revealed that they only want to leave Sid's annoying Granny with him and leave him again. When Manny catches Peaches hanging with friends after he told her not to, Manny and Peaches have a falling out. Soon after, the breakup of the continent separates Manny from his family. Manny gets stuck on a floating ice raft with Sid, Diego and Granny. A large moving landmass drives Ellie, Peaches, and a herd of other animals towards a land bridge, where Manny had told them to go. Manny promises to come back to them, but may have some trouble getting back.<br/><br/>This was a crazed celebrity fest of voices: Nick Frost, Queen Latifah, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo, Wanda Sykes, Simon Pegg, Jennifer Lopez, Ray Romano, Seann William Scott, the list goes on. Makes you really wonder where the budgets for these films go when you got big names. A little advice to Hollywood when it comes to animated films: use the money budget towards the script and animation, not the voices. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. I didn't respond too well to hearing Wanda's screeching voice for 80% of the film. Did it really make a difference to have Jennifer Lopez's voice in the movie? But given credit where it's due, I did like the new character/villain, Captain Gutt and his pirates. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost do add a lot of comedy to the movie, because of their natural chemistry, it just works. The animation is very nice, especially during the storm scenes.<br/><br/>Over all, I did like the movie, it wasn't a waste of time and I got a few laughs out of it. I think the heart of the film goes to Scrat, no matter how many times I see him chasing after those acorns, I don't think I could ever get sick of it. I also liked how the film took a little clever twist with telling the story of the Odyssey so the kids would not only have a good time, but to learn a great story of adventure. But it's still only worth the rental, at most a matinée. I think the kids will definitely get a kick out of it, but that's about it. I don't know if this will be the last Ice Age, but as long as Hollywood wants it's money and this movie makes number one at the box office, I think we'll probably have another one.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Ice Age: Continental Drift tells the story of...well... how the continents came apart into what we know today. As this is happening, Manny, Diego, and Sid are separated from Ellie and Peaches during this continental crack-up, and they must find a way back home. Unfortunately, they run into a few pirates along the way. While this is happening, Scrat finds a map to acorn paradise and is trying to find it.<br/><br/>This is a worthy sequel to a great franchise. I don't know why the only one that got the best reviews on Rotten Tomatoes was the first one. To be honest, each movie keeps on getting bigger and bigger, with this one not only having a huge problem, but a bad guy along the way.<br/><br/>The voices are all great, as well. We have Nicki Minaji, Drake, Jennifer Lopez, Peter Dinklage, and Wanda Sykes were all truly welcome to this franchise. However, it is the main voices that are the true stars here. Queen Latifah is great, as always. Sean William Scott and Josh Peck do a great job at Crash and Eddie, Ellie's possum brothers. And, of course, the main trio. Dennis Leary as Diego is great (Dennis is doing a great job this year; he's got ""The Amazing Spider-man"" under his belt, as well). John Leguizamo is always hilarious as Sid. And as for Ray Romano, let's just say that I'm a big fan of him and his old show ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" so anytime I get to hear him in a movie, I'm all up for it.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a great movie. It might seem a little stupid, but it's the Ice Age series, so it's all good fun. An 8/10 for me."

","The ""Ice Age"" movies were all fantastic. The animation is great, the voice acting is hilarious and every movie got a great story. But, to me, the best movie in the franchise is ""Ice Age 4"". I really enjoyed this movie more than the others. The story involves around Manny, Sid and Diego on a new adventure after the Pangaea continent gets set adrift. In order to get back home, they use a small ice berg as their boat, but along the way, Sid gets reunited with his old family and Diego falls in love with a saber-toothed cat named Shira. Like i said, the franchise is great, but the fourth movie makes it even better. The story is even stronger, the animation is better and the voice acting was absolutely good. There are a lot of hilarious moments all through the movie and i really liked the movie's theme song ""Chasing the sun"" by The Wanted. Although, i gotta admit, it still looks kinda familiar with the other movies, nothing new happens. But i still think ""Ice Age 4"" is the greatest movie in the franchise.<br/><br/>9/10"

","A lot has happened since the release of the original Ice Age when Manny, Diego and Sid first met. This time around, their existence is threatened when their continent begins to break apart, forcing everyone to have to flee from their established homes. However, things go a little wrong resulting in Manny, Diego and Sid being caught up in a battle against a pirate ape, Captain Gutt.<br/><br/>For those who have not been keeping up with all the release of the Ice Age series, going to view the latest installment should not prove to be any hindrance into the overall world that has been created. Sure, the relationship between the protagonists may not be fully understandable but each's unique personality is unveiled very early. This ensures that you do not have to think too much and you can let yourself go for the adventures which ensues. This is not to say that Continental Drift is devoid of any tangible story, it is just not a unique or promising one. In short, the main characters are trying to get back to their families (well Manny at least) and this brings up the tried and tested theme of family bonding. There is a good lesson here to be taught to kids, though parents are most likely going to ignore the fluff. Thankfully, the film does have its fair share of good laughs. Most is aimed at kids which can provide the odd smile but then at times the writers do their best and it shows. Continental Drift is not a minute-by-minute comedy affair, but every aspect of the story and writing do adequately fall into place.<br/><br/>The voice acting is a lot of fun, mainly due to the performances by Ray Romano, Denis Leary, and John Leguizamo. The rest of the actors are by no means bad, for they all feel and sound comfortable in the roles assigned to them. This brings about a voice talent that fits well within the mould of the story itself allowing dialogue and comedy to be presented in a clear manner without ever sounding incompetent.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is pretty good. The animation is crisp and clear though lacking any noticeable advances in the medium. The 3D is not too bad itself: it is never distracting nor does it particularly standout or enhance the experience. But what was pretty fun was the full 4D effect. Moving chairs, water vapour being sprayed on you and air passing by your skin. While 4D is not something new to anyone who has experienced it, it did feel like it enhanced the film-watching experience. I cannot imagine it being suitable to all types of films, but in the case of a 3D animation like Ice Age, the film begins to feel more fun for it.<br/><br/>As an animation aimed at children, the worse the film receives is some name calling and some relatively non-violent action scenarios.<br/><br/>Ice Age: Continental Drift can be seen as a somewhat tired film. It's story is not particularly strong nor is the comedy always engaging. But it wades through these rough seas to make an impact that is adequate enough to keep your interest through to the film's conclusion. Add in some nice looking animation and the bonus 4D (if you are lucky) and the end result is something that can be enjoyable if you allow it to be."

The father was a strong man of his family. He was persistent and had good values. In most movies you see these days Hollywood likes to make the Dad's look stupid. I'm serious. If you really pay attention to certain shows and movies they make women look smarter and more intelligent.

I say ""person"": she's a mammoth, of course.<br/><br/>The action in this movie starts at frame one and never stops - it is wonderfully animated, visually dazzling (although the 3D is not as effective as it could be), often very funny, and a good, solid, family movie which will keep everybody interested throughout its length.<br/><br/>I wonder if it is just me, though, but I feel there is something missing - this happened with the Shrek films, too.

"TheVictoriousV","4","0","2","18 July 2012"," Over-crowded, dumbed down and uninspired. The franchise needs to end.
","There is a scene at the very end of the first Ice Age film that shows a creature known as Scrat emerging from a block of ice thousands of years after the events of the film. I'm going to assume something similar happened to the rest of the cast; that they were frozen in time throughout the entire ice age, explaining their presence in the worsening sequels which are all set in a time when Sid, Diego and Manfred would logically be long dead.<br/><br/>Even if this explanation was canon I would still question the existence of these sequels in general. Ice Age was a lovely film, but was it really so fantastic that it warranted another installment, let alone three? Apparently, because the next chapter, Continental Drift is now playing in theaters.<br/><br/>As per tradition, little Scrat's storyline is what gets the film started. Still he tries to protect his little acorn from improbable mishaps and disasters which in one way or the other affects the main plot. In this one he sets in motion the Pangea break-up through what's easily his most over-the-top prologue to date! The main plot focuses, as usual, on woolly mammoth Manfred (Ray Romano), sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) and saber-tooth Diego (Denis Leary) as well as Manfred's wife Ellie (Queen Latifah), opossum twins Eddie & Crash (Seann William Scott, Josh Peck) plus a newcomer, Manfred and Ellie's daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer). The plot itself, the family is separated during a quake that just so happens to be the start of the forming of the continents, brought on by you-know-who.<br/><br/>Manfred, Sid and Diego are separated from the others and eventually end up in the clutches of a pirate crew, lead by prehistoric monkey Gutt (Peter Dinklage), sailing the seas on a floating iceberg. They eventually escape however, bringing along another saber-tooth named Shira (Jennifer Lopez). A romance subplot between her and Diego is inevitable but sort of pointless. Another extra member of Manfred's crew is Sid's senile granny named, well, Granny (Wanda Sykes). You know all those family members Sid mentioned in the first film but we never saw? Well, in this film we do. Sort of.<br/><br/>It provides lots of pirate-related adventure, spliced together with more slapstick from Scrat, a pointless Madagascar 2-esque love triangle between Peaches, another mammoth (Aubrey Drake Graham) and a damn mole (Josh Gad) and some comic relief bits involving Crash and Eddie, two of the more pointless characters, whom I honestly wish the third or even second film would've just killed off.<br/><br/>Watching all this slapstick, all these jokes and all this 3D action, I longed for the first Ice Age film and its subtle moments built entirely on silence and atmosphere. After all these sequels, how many people actually remember that the first installment was so genuinely powerful? That film had Sid as the only comic relief type character. At the time of Continental Drift, it feels like every other character is a comic relief, but especially the blissfully clumsy Sid and the idiotic brothers O'Possum. No, there's no crazy-ass Simon Pegg-weasel this time. Ergo no fun!<br/><br/>The saving grace of Ice Age 4, like in all the sequels, is the lovable Scrat, even if his first scene in the film is almost a little too over- the-top and insane even for him. But he remains a lovely character who is granted the more inventive slapstick comedy, which is made all the better from the lack of obnoxious dialogue. Everything else in the film is loud, full of pop culture references and scattered with celebrity voices, which proves how dumbed down and ""kiddified"" the franchise has become. I guess I also enjoyed some of the action, the bad guy and this one pirate voiced by Nick Frost, but that's about it.<br/><br/>Ice Age 4 – Continental Drift is irritating, over-crowded and unnecessary. Way too many characters, pointlessly many plot lines, needlessly exaggerated slapstick scenes, an uninspired story, only the occasional funny scene and a rushed pacing brought on by the combination of a short runtime and an enormous cast of characters. If you're a die- hard fan of these films you'll probably like this one okay, in which case I must also admire your patience.<br/><br/>Apparently one of the side characters was voiced by Nicki Minaj, which makes me appreciate the fact that I saw a half-assed Swedish dub a whole lot more."

In the final scene where the animals find a new home, look out for a Statue of Liberty at the entrance of the harbour. This conjures up similarities of how the new immigrants must have felt when they sailed to America in the beginning of the last century as their respective homelands were torn apart. It's quite powerful stuff. And of course, if you were wondering how America got its deserts despite having one of most fertile places in the world, its all because of an acorn :)"

","The ICE AGE franchise thrives with CONTINENTAL DRIFT. Ellie(Queen Latifah)is trying to calm down Manny(Ray Romano)as he is experiencing the age gap and trying to understand while protecting daughter Peaches(KeKe Palmer). Sid(John Leguizamo)finds he has real family when he is reunited with his Granny(Wanda Sykes). Hapless Scrat(Chris Wedge) and his continued pursuit of the cursed acorn sets off a world-changing sequence of events triggering a continental drift. In the scurry searching for safety Manny, Sid and Diego are separated from the others as they are set adrift and end up using an iceberg as a ship. They will encounter inept pirates and other obstacles in their way of finding the way back home. I really like this cast of characters better than those in the Madagascar movies. There is plenty of adventure and what seems obligatory mild rude humor; but believe me, no one will go away disappointed. Others lending their voices: Jennifer Lopez, Seann William Scott, Peter Dinklage, Jennette McCurdy, Josh Gad, Nick Frost and Aziz Ansari."

","It's hard to believe that the Ice Age series began 10 years ago and is still going this strong. While there have been some weak moments in the series, each installment has been entertaining on some level and clearly done well enough to spawn a fourth addition to the series with Ice Age: Continental Drift. All the original cast of Ray Romano, Denis Leary, and John Lequizamo are back as well as every new member that has joined up along the way and some new additions in this installment. Has this series finally dried up or could they possibly create yet another fun adventure for these characters? Ice Age: Continental Drift follows everyone's favorite prehistoric characters as they are forced on an all new adventure when the continent is split and set adrift at sea. Along the way they encounter new and interesting characters including a band of pirates sailing and iceberg ship exploring the new world. Not only is this another fun addition to the series, it may easily be the best yet. The story is pretty simple and fun keeping the same format that has been working, but returning to an adventure that focuses more on the original three than all the others, yet still giving them their time to play. The villainous pirates led by Gutt and voiced brilliantly by Peter Dinklage was the most entertaining character that has been introduced to this series so far. They even managed to keep the long running Scrat story fun where it should have run its course by now. All the voice actors maintain the good work they have done from the start keeping these characters from wavering their personalities. The animation this time around seemed to come off as some the best of all the films looking as though it had been cleaned up a bit more. The 3D worked well enough but never was just in your face and annoying.<br/><br/>Anyone that has had fun with this series at all should check this one out as you are sure to have a great time. If it makes the money again there is no doubt that they will churn out another one, but this one is a good way to just let the series end on a high note. It kind of comes full circle finally giving everyone some sort of relationship of their own in a happily ever after way without being too mushy about it.<br/><br/>http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey"

","The experience of watching this movie is like spending a whole day in an amusement park. All you get is happiness and excitement. Although it is a slick formula sequel, it is the kind that I am willing to spend my money on and have fun. You probably gonna tell a lot of scenes familiar, which may always be seen in huge Hollywood blockbusters. The 3D effect is gorgeous. The punchlines are brilliant. Some unknown species of mice or squirrels are really really cute. After the campus screening, we got the chance to meet one of the producer, our alumnae from Blue Sky. It's always nice to hear from the creator of a good work."
"j_amster_12","8","0","1","12 July 2012"," Its back!
","Ice age is back and is still strong !! although this series of films has been going on a while and well mostly its predicable of what is going to happen, i still enjoyed this film and would recommend it to families to sit down and have a laugh and a giggle. <br/><br/>I do have some small things with this film like the fact some parts of the film did seem to drag a small bit however they have to fill the time and you are going to find some slow bits never the less it was good. There was just one more thing. Im not going to give anything away but some parts of this film i feel i have seen in every single ice age and that it has just repeated its self and nothing that new and so funny you may wet your self a little has come along.<br/><br/>Saying that i would gladly watch this film again without any problems and still have the same enjoyment. I would recommend you watch it! I would not go to the cinema again and see this film but i will probably watch this film when it comes out on TV. <br/><br/>Over all its well worth a watch and good fun for the family. For this i give this film a 8/10 which is very good in my view. It does loose the 2 marks off 10 because of the repeated jokes but i love ice age and i know you do as well inside and doesn't matter if your old or young you will like/love this film :)"
"DICK STEEL","7","0","2","12 July 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Ice Age: Continental Drift
","It's been a decade since the release of the very first Ice Age, and thankfully this installment of the franchise managed to stay afloat by keeping things simple, even though it still kept within its constraints of setting in the prehistoric era, and still having to bounce around the usual theme of family. Competitors like Shrek did its franchise in by doing too much too soon in delivering lacklustre gags and spoofs of pop culture that can only get you so far, and Madagascar showed how it went from strength to strength, so unless Ice Age comes up with something new, I don't really suppose it can survive beyond this, although I am more than glad to be proved wrong.<br/><br/>As with the teaser scenes released months back, Continental Drift opens with Scrat being directly responsible for the splitting up of the Earth's land mass into what would be the layout of today, no thanks to his continued pursuit of the acorn. And like the earlier installments, he's mostly left to do his own thing with minimal interaction with the rest of the crew, undoubtedly being one of the top draws of Ice Age. We reunite with the motley crew of Manny the mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo), Diego the Sabre-tooth Tiger (Denis Leary), who find themselves split from their main herd when the continents split apart, and have to find their way to get back from the high seas to dry land.<br/><br/>That forms the crux of the main narrative, with the trio joined by Sid's grandmother (Wanda Sykes), whose presence again harks back to the theme of family, and lending themselves to be the central punching bag for gags. In finding their way back, they encounter the main antagonists of animal pirates led by a prehistoric monkey who calls itself Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) and deputized by a white sabre-tooth tiger Shira (Jennifer Lopez), who are adamant in having Manny and gang join their crew to loot and plunder from more lands. The introduction of a pirate crew as voiced by the likes of Nick Frost, Aziz Ansari and Alain Chabat provide for an expanded cast and characters that Ice Age 4 is of no lack of, including bit roles for Seann William Scott and Patrick Stewart.<br/><br/>Ice Age is clearly aimed at the younger demographics from Madagascar, and its simplicity reflects this rather clearly. Language is kept fairly simple, and almost all instances of action are kept firmly in PG, with the largest threat posed by Captain Gutt's razor sharp nails. The storyline doesn't toss up any surprises, since you'll come to expect how the story would develop, with wafer thin subplots such as the friendship gone sour between Manny and Ellie's daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) and best pal Louis the molehog (Josh Gad) due to the former's supposed love interest, and her need to belong to her same mammoth kind, and a possible romance between Diego and Shira, which I suspect will be further developed should another follow up film be made. Queen Latifah got a reduced role here, moving aside for Peaches to step up as her character's daughter.<br/><br/>As usual, the animation here is first class, and despite not having watched this in the 3D format, one can guess the moments where the format gets exploited in certain scenes, with extreme closeups, and opportunity in the form of various weapons being wielded and utilized by the pirate crew. Certain scenes do make themselves quite blatant in having characters and behaviour happening directly and up close on screen, while the hasty introduction of even smaller furry creatures probably had merchandising in mind. The pirate crew does deserve special mention for how varied they all are and caricatured for story efficiency, and they do warrant perhaps a short film or direct to video adventure of their own.<br/><br/>Preceded by a Simpsons short entitled The Longest Daycare, do make sure you turn up early for that, as I was a bit more entertained with what Maggie Simpson had done as the sole, primary protagonist in this short film, than everything Ice Age 4 had thrown up. This is not to say that Ice Age 4 is a bad film, on the contrary it makes for a great family outing to the movies with its entertainment value, but unless it comes up with a stronger storyline should the franchise desires to be continued, it will soon run out of steam rehashing the same old themes, and be threatened with cinematic extinction despite growing in cast numbers."
