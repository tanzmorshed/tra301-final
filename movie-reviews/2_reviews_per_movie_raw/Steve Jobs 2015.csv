"AlsExGal","9","48","68","8 July 2017"," an abstract portrait of the man..
","... in that you can argue about almost every stroke in the painting, yet when you stand back a few feet from the work, you realize that this is a more accurate portrayal of Steve Jobs than any photograph could be.<br/><br/>For example, Michael Fassbender looks nothing like Steve Jobs did at any point in his adult life, sounds nothing like Steve Jobs did. Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.<br/><br/>Kate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.<br/><br/>As for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.<br/><br/>So don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended."

","This movie is a dramatization, based on stuff that really happened, and it is a really cool movie.<br/><br/>No, this movie isn't meant to show history exactly as it happened. If you want to know all that read the book by Walter Isaacson. It's a great book.<br/><br/>The script is pure Sorkin-Porn. Rapid-fire dialogue with 2 conversations going on at the same time. If you liked The West Wing or any of Aaron Sorkin's other movies, you'll feel at home with this one.<br/><br/>They also get the small emotional moments right as well. Some of the best moments are between Steve and his daughter.<br/><br/>The directing and editing is masterful. I liked the choice to shoot on different formats for the different years and the flashback scenes punctuate the drama on screen perfectly. <br/><br/>All the actors do a fine job, especially Michael Stuhlbarg who plays Andy Hertzfeld.<br/><br/>I hope when they release this movie on blu ray they include the video of the real Steve doing these product launches as bonus features.<br/><br/>If you can get past the fact that this movie isn't a word for word recreation of history, you will enjoy it."
"AliceofX","7","71","123","1 December 2015"," A Portrait
","I remember when back in 2013 the Jobs movie came out. Everything about the film's trailer was ""do not see"". Still to this day the moment when Kutcher says ""we're making Apple cool again"" makes me laugh. Right from the start this film looked like they were going to do it right and I was anxiously waiting for it. And even though Steve Jobs wasn't everything I thought it would be it is still a quality drama.<br/><br/>Yet I can also see why it was not so commercially successful. It's weird format of taking place before three computer unveilings and the film essentially consisting of conversations with limited action between them. It is by no means a biography of the man's entire life but it does paint a portrait which, like any picture, only reveals some aspects of the person.<br/><br/>The film has a great cast who give solid performances. Michael Fassbender creates a character whose tyrannical and devilish behaviour you want to keep watching while longing for a glimpse of the human side.<br/><br/>Overall Steve Jobs is a very watchable and engaging film, provided you are already into end of the year Oscar bait drama films."
"Sidd_The_Movie_Slayer","10","143","265","10 October 2015"," iGod Or iMonster?
","Steve Jobs is written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle. It stars Micheal Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels, and Michael Stuhlbarg.<br/><br/>Set backstage at three iconic product launches and ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac, Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint a portrait of the man, his estranged family and staff at its epicenter.<br/><br/>I honestly can't start this review without saying this easily ties with my favorite movie of the year, The Gift, for quite a few reasons. Truth be told this movie has everything needed to build a classic and uses it remarkably.<br/><br/>Writer Aaron Sorkin has quite a few gems in his filmography which include Money Ball, Social Network and A Few Good Men. He is as versatile as he is brutal in honesty. He works wonders in this movie revealing the man behind the machine rather than the machine behind the man. Without any scenes of failure or success, Sorkin forces his audience to understand the complex and often times revolting central Character. With extremely well written confrontations between Jobs and Wozniak or Jobs and his Daughter or even Jobs and his Boss, Sorkin relentlessly demonstrates the true nature behind the tech giant. Though this movie's central family tension and the Job vs. Apple drama are enthralling, Sorkin injects just enough dry and black comedy to keep the movie from becoming an influential figure's shaming. With that being said Sorkin also understands that the enormous ego of Steve Jobs had to be exposed as a vice and plays on that brutal fact perfectly. With 4 dimensional characters, great central dramas and pitch perfect comedy, this might actually be his best work yet.<br/><br/>Accompanying the stellar writing was Danny Boyle's beautiful direction. Through seemingly unending shots and aggressive movements the audience genuinely feels like their in Job's presence which can be very hard to sit through at times but is ultimately rewarding experience. With visible passion from Boyle, this is one powerful ride.<br/><br/>To my common readers I mentioned a few weeks back that Black Mass had the greatest ensemble cast of the year, I was wrong. This movies cast never really stops acting to the point of absolute realism. To start Kate Winslet portrayal of real life Johanna Hoffman was as beautiful as it was naive. She brought the character alive in full force and truly demonstrated she is one of the best actresses working. I smell a nomination coming her way. I had referenced Jeff Daniel's acting last week in The Martian, well he completely out did himself. He was tender at times and shark-like in others. He drew the line between intelligence and decency and walks this tight rope carefully. Five year old Mekenzie Moss also offers an absolutely astounding performance, uttering few but heart wrenching words. Michael Stuhlbarg works wonder as well on a albeit smaller degree. <br/><br/>Now onto the two heavy hitters. A surprise to me and my theater alike, Seth Rogan gives the single best dramatic performance of his career. As Steve Wozniak, the literal opposite of Jobs, Rogan played the role with elegance and brilliance and I wouldn't even mind the Benicio snub if Rogen won the statue. The role demanded a sweet, naive, caring and ultimately explosive performance and Rogan more than delivered making the scenes of abrasion between him and Fassbender iconic. <br/><br/>I have been holding off that name for the entire review because Micheal Fassbender is the only thing keeping this movie from failing. He dawns the character in such a way, I can only compare it to Jake Gyllenhaal from Night Crawler and even then I don't think I could fully describe it. Filled to the brim with nuance Fassbender offers a cold, intelligent, manipulative, calculating, and over all disturbingly realistic portrayal of Steve Jobs. I really can't envision a better cast lead than him. As calm as he is diabolical, Fassbender plays this egotistical narcissist with such precision its close to horrifying to watch. Though calm through most of the movie Fassbender understands when to unleash the monster which lays in Jobs and is absolutely volcanic while doing so. Under all the deception, tyranny, and technological brilliance lays a purely adroit and masterful performance. Though Johnny Depp in Black Mass was great and Ian McClellan in Mr. Holmes was grand, neither of them embodied their characters much like Micheal Fassbender and it would be a shame and a disservice to cinema if he didn't with Best Actor. He has proved he is one of the best actors of the generation.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs was a privilege to see on the big screen and is so far tied with The Gift as my number one movie of the year. With Deft acting, exquisite direction, and powerful writing this movie is not far from a modern classic. Steve Jobs gets an A+."

","First of all.. I've seen Jobs with Ashton Kutcher and it wasn't that bad as everyone said and i personally think it was much more interesting than this one.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs was entertaining.. yes, but it was difficult to follow the plot. After watching the Movie i had no clue what Steve actually did, i mean i know some things, but i've learned nothing about his life after seeing this Movie. The only thing that this Movie brought to me was the Fact that he sucked as a Father and as a Human. Do i know why he did all this?...no.<br/><br/>In the End this Movie opened a lot of questions but none of them getting answered and this is the reason why i think i didn't liked it that much.<br/><br/>Yes the acting was great and all, but i hope it's not just me who thinks that a Movie needs more than just good acting.. <br/><br/>Would you like to see the invention of Apple and what Steve Jobs done for it, watch the one with Ashton Kutcher...<br/><br/>If you like to see a Movie about Steve Jobs personal life without any real answers to it, watch this Movie..."
"kuuk3","2","49","88","18 November 2015"," Two hours of shouting, watching parents fight and never any payoff.
","This film consists of four 30-minutes argument montages, all set right before a press launch. Apparently, every worm in the wood comes out just before he releases something which I have a very hard time believing to be true. Then its about the shouting match Steve has with five people as he moans, complains, gets angry and solves nothing. Seriously, only one of those arguments gets a form of resolution at the end and the other four are swept under the rug. And we never see any of the press conferences. Its like watching the build up to the show but never the show itself. We didn't need to see the full thing, just something that shows us viewers who are not familiar with the person, the conclusion to the story. If you have little to no knowledge about Steve Jobs, this film will not only be confusing but also get you hating the guy for things that were not really his fault. <br/><br/>And it misses out a lot, his wife, children, the iphone, ipad, his illness and death. It really is just him shouting at people without context or any knowledge of the story in-between which gets him to that moment. For example, one minute he is going on stage to show the Mac, then the next scene we are backstage again with him having been fired about to present the NEXT computer. We find out through the arguing he was voted out, but we never see what caused it or the breakdown at work. <br/><br/>I disliked this film, and it makes Ashton Kutchers version look like a masterpiece in comparison."
"thu-4","1","12","18","13 February 2016"," Uninspired and simply untrue
","I confess, I was not expecting much from this movie but the many good critics made me curious. I am a visual person and the thinking about seeing someone playing Steve Joby who has no resemblance whatsoever of him really did not excite me.<br/><br/>Now that I saw that movie I must say it really was as bad as I feared. But not for the appearance of Fassbender. The no-Steve-Jobs-looking actor did not hurt as much as I thought. No. It was the story. That mainly everything happens right before some of Jobs most important product presentations. We are always in the back of an auditorium or stage or stage rehearsal and it seems as in Steves live all his relationships or the profound discussions about them happened minutes before his presentations.<br/><br/>It is just ridiculous. It makes the whole movie ridiculous.<br/><br/>Some say they saw bits of the real Steve in Fassbenders acting. Maybe. But then thats all that is real about this flick."
"JaysonT","4","102","204","29 December 2015"," Boring, Uneventful & Slow
","Steve Jobs has one of the worst movie titles in film history. Of all the names for the marketing team to come up with, this was the weakest one. If the Ashton Kutcher movie hadn't been released already, I am betting the farm this would have been named Jobs. That being said, the movie plays REALLY long- and until the ending, it's a talky bore.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender plays the title role, and although he's a fine actor- Christian Bale (the original choice), should have been cast. Nonetheless Fassbender does what he can. We witness how the co-founder of Apple is during three behind-the-scenes unveiling's for his product, all before the 2000s. <br/><br/>When watching the movie, I was reminded of The Iron Lady with Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher. Both that film and this center around a famous public figure, but the movies aren't really about them or told as biopics. They are more personalized and experimental. Streep's movie is really about how a woman deals with dementia and her love for her husband. Fassbender's movie really is about how a man deals with narcissism and his love for his daughter. Both films are uneven and messy because the focus is too grounded in emotion, when the audience is more interested in their overall lives and not just these niche moments. Because of this, both movies are not that interesting to watch- but are elevated by strong performances. Streep won an Oscar for her role, and Fassbender will be nominated.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet, with an uneven accent, plays Steve Jobs' assistant who is the only person who can really stand up to him (well, that's a lie- since Seth Rogan and Jeff Daniels also have cat fights). I was a little annoyed with Winslet's personality, and awful hairdo. She starts getting on my nerves when she threatens to quit unless Steve can patch things up with his daughter. Any professional knows not to mix business with personal- and her job is to work for Apple, not be a therapist. Winslet is okay in her scenes, but her character is unlikable. If I were Steve Jobs, I would have fired her.<br/><br/>Then there's the business of Lisa- the daughter, and I guess the TRUE emotional back-story for the movie's purpose. Forget that I'm worth billions of dollars, I better run after my little girl and remind her that I plan to invent the iPod for her songs and that I remembered some dumb painting she made on the Macintosh when she was 5. The daughter is also unnerving because Steve Jobs was paying child support, and didn't love the Mother anymore. He owes nothing to his daughter if he doesn't wish to donate- but he attempts to show he cares, and she eventually folds in the parking lot (which looks just like the parking lot in the Tom Cruise movie Vanilla Sky).<br/><br/>Steve Jobs is talky and overtly uncinematic, so I was restless when viewing it. There is nothing happening but a lot of nerdy white people talking really fast and using big words to impress folks. Oh, sound like The Social Network all over again? Well, Aaron Sorkin wrote that too. He's not a good screenwriter- he's an elitist who has a big vocabulary. But he sucks at creating characters that are believable. Fassbender and Daniels aside, this movie is one of 2015's biggest disappointments. <br/><br/>FINAL GRADE: D"

","If you want to see a film that goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on about what a selfish, obsessed, self-absorbed jerk Steve Jobs was, then watch this film. Otherwise, don't bother. That point is made in the first five minutes. And the next five minutes. And the five minutes after that. And the five minutes after that. And all the way through to the final five minutes before the end of the film. No character arc whatsoever can be had. Nothing changes from ""fade in"" to ""fade out"". The one attempt to shift the arc at the end of the movie falls flat with ambiguity. Boring as hell. I have no idea why this film has such high viewer ratings and an above-average Metascore.

"luke-a-mcgowan","7","19","33","30 December 2015"," A great movie but a minor letdown. Fassbender best in show
","Steve Jobs fails to explode off the screen like The Social Network or Charlie Wilson's War did. There's all the things to love about Aaron Sorkin's writing and the acting is terrific, but Sorkin's screenplay lacks the enjoyable bite of his previous efforts and the whole thing comes off rather lacklustre.<br/><br/>On the film's highlights - Fassbender leaps off the screen in the first two minutes and never lets go. He looks nothing like Jobs himself did but he perfectly captures the frustrating ego that everyone loathed and matches it with high spirit and a bit of humour. His condescension is so real that we snarl at it. Winslett also makes her mark very early on, nailing an accent and vanishing into the part of Johanna. Her chemistry with Fassbender is palpable. Seth Rogen crushes the role of Steve Wozniak, a casting choice I've been thrilled about since 2014, nailing the low self-esteem and nervous ticks of the nerdy genius. Watching Rogen perform we can see his anger but also the slight plea for their friendship to endure. We all know that one friend who feels like they're doing us a favour by being friends with us, and watching Fassbender and Rogen banter back and forth we can see it in real time. Jeff Daniels rounds out the four-person highlight as Apple's CEO, and truly stands out as a great supporting player. <br/><br/>Probably the most talked about feature of Steve Jobs is the three-act narrative filmed in different styles. Its been reported on a million times and all I'll say is I loved it. The transition between the three events are also clever, montages of real media reports and pictures. There's even a very cleverly used Simpsons gag that helps inform the audience. I also loved the playful score and the cinematography that emulates the walk and talk of the West Wing.<br/><br/>The screenplay is Steve Jobs' greatest aider and abetter. The film's best scenes are written masterpieces - two fights between Jobs and Wozniak in particular take your breath away, a harsh comment where Jobs cuts down his 5 year old girl's beliefs are harsh, the recurring references to Jobs' adoption are clever and the two Andys joke is a nice funny recurring gag. However, Sorkin's screenplay at times feels like a textbook, and with so many words floating around its easy to lose track of what's happening. Some of the lines of dialogue are so pretentious its easy to get taken out of the film. It's also annoying to see Sorkin recycle his classic Sorkinisms ""Don't talk to me like I'm other people"" and ""well one day you'll have to tell us how you did it"". When you've seen them a couple of times, they lost impact right where they're needed most. Sadly, Sorkin starts to get too smart for his own good.<br/><br/>I didn't care much for the story arc Jobs went on. He is vehemently opposed to being Lisa's father and hurts the little girl by saying the computer was not named after her. Then all of a sudden he's a caring father and the girl's mother (played wonderfully by Katharine Waterston) is portrayed as the film's villain. In the final act, Jobs has a very clunky reconciliation on the rooftop and says things that simply don't fit right with the story. <br/><br/>There's a lot of talent involved in this movie that I really wanted to love. Fassbender and his co-stars all do exceptional work and Sorkin delivers a number of wonderful scenes, but at the end of the day I can't help but walk away feeling like Jeff Daniels' character, mourning for the things that could've been achieved."
"r-heimdal","4","18","31","24 October 2015"," ""I'm Poorly Made""....What Can I Say I Hired the Wrong Guy
","Because of the Sony hacks we know that David Fincher was slated to direct. He demanded a $10 million dollar payday and Christian Bale as Steve. I cannot for the life of me fathom why, after just crafting a masterwork like ""Social Network"" and Fincher's seminal filmography, Sony wouldn't pony up the cash to get this right. I like Danny Boyle, but he's not David Fincher. <br/><br/>You would never know after seeing this film that Steve had a wonderful marriage and clearly loved his children. Lisa moved in with Steve as a child and they reconciled. Steve built loyal relationships with people that wanted to work for him which was the only way they could have created planet shaking products like the iPhone. These folks could have gone anywhere - but they wanted to work for Steve - and under Steve they did the best work of their lives. He bought and built Pixar, the most successful movie studio of all time. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web on Job's NeXT machine. He changed the music industry with iTunes. He brought tablet computing to the masses. He waged thermonuclear war against Bill Gates and Google....and won. Steve's 1975 vision of a computer on every desk became flesh. When Steve came back to Apple in 1997 it was 12 weeks away from bankruptcy. He turned Apple into the most valuable company on the planet in the single greatest comeback story in American business history. <br/><br/>But you wouldn't know any of that after seeing this film. None of this was deemed important enough to be in the film. <br/><br/>Separated into 3, 45-minute Acts this version of the movie should have been a play. Each of the three scenes take place at 3 different product launches: Macintosh, Next and iMac. None of what you see on screen actually took place in real life. The characters chosen to be in the film were not present at these product launches. Lisa was not at a single product launch. Here, she appears in all three Acts. Sorkin makes a fatal mistake by making Lisa the centerpiece of each scene and, as he admitted in a interview, the 'hero' of the film. Act III takes place in 1998 for the iMac release and Steve is talking to Lisa about the iPod which wasn't released until 2001. They imply that NeXT was created to be acquired by Apple which is false. No signs of any of Steve's most important triumphs. No signs of any of the landmark products other than the Mac. Steve never spoke to Scully after he resigned from Apple, yet he appears at a NeXT product launch as CEO of Apple while Apple was suing NeXT. Joanna Hoffman was not a part of the Apple comeback in 1998. Woz was not at those product launches. Sorkin and Boyle get the NeXT, Lisa, Scully, Hoffman and Woz story dead wrong. <br/><br/>I don't recognize this person at all. I left the theater upset, bemused and saddened. The movie is a minefield of disappointment and frustrating inaccuracies. <br/><br/>Steve Jobs gets a 4 for squandering the opportunity to tell the definitive version of this dynamic life story. <br/><br/>Shame on them - not just for letting down his surviving family, close friends and Apple fans - but for the young boy or girl who goes into this film trying to learn about the innovator."

Awful script, terrible casting, amateur directing. If Steve Jobs still was alive wouldn't let this movie to be displayed. The first 40 minute of the move was about some ridiculous, nonsense argument between 2-4 persons. Like a bad Brazilian soap opera.

","After watching the lackluster Ashton Kutcher film ""Jobs"" two years ago,my earnest hope was that there is will be a better film released sometime in the future.With director David Boyle,screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and a cast led by Michael Fassbender working together on a film based on the Walter Isaacson's authorized biography on the late Apple CEO,will ""Steve Jobs"" be answer?<br/><br/>The film consists of something similar to a three-act play wherein we get to see the life of Steve Jobs during the unveiling of a new product at three different times of his life.The first act consists of having Jobs working for Apple as a member of an Macintosh R and D group and whose company is about to release the new computer called Macintosh in 1984.The second act consists of having Jobs,who was fired from Apple, now working in his new company called NeXT Computers,which is about to unveil the new computer called ""Cube"" in 1988.The final act consists of Jobs now again back at Apple working as the CEO and whose company is to release a new computer called iMac in 1998.<br/><br/>In these three parts of the film,we get to witness Jobs in three different times of his life from being an company founder of the flourishing Apple Computer Company during the release of the Macintosh in 1984;a fired Apple employee who just started a new lackluster NeXT company during the release of the Cube in 1988; and finally a leader of a resurging Apple company during the release of the iMac in 1998.At the center of these events is Jobs and how he has found success early in his life;get humbled after getting fired from his company by the board and start a new company that had limited success; and get hired back to his company and help it get back from state of being close to bankruptcy into becoming the most successful company in the world.At the center of it all is his relationship with his daughter Lisa whom he first refused to acknowledge when he had early success in life;later reconnected with her during the humbling moments of his life; and finally formed a father-and-daughter relationship when he found a renewed success when he got back to his former company.<br/><br/>As for fans and haters alike of the late Apple CEO,Fassbender provides us a marvelous portrayal of a Steve Jobs being both an innovator and a monster alike.We get to witness him as someone that is extremely difficult to get along with due to being an extremely arrogant egomaniac but at the same time whose thinking and ideas for innovation and marketing has led the computer industry into greater heights.Apparently,Steve Wozniak,who acted as consultant to the film,will definitely be more satisfied as it presents a horrible Steve Jobs and it provides appreciation to the engineers and technicians who worked behind the scenes for the release of the successful products of Apple.<br/><br/>The film consists of lots of dialogues between characters that is why listening essential to fully appreciate it.In fact,I would not be surprised if ""Steve Jobs"" will become a theatrical play someday.Finally,going back to my question: Was this a better biopic compared to the one released two years ago? Absolutely!!!!!"
"jtindahouse","9","27","51","24 February 2016"," Perfectly written and everything goes from there
","I remember before 'The Social Network' came out people couldn't imagine how you could make an interesting screenplay out of the creation of Facebook. However they had underestimated Aaron Sorkin and soon after its release realised their mistake. The dialogue he writes and the pacing of his storytelling is second only to Christopher and Jonathan Nolan in my opinion. 'Steve Jobs' is another fine example of his talents. He tells the story in a unique way, dividing the story into three parts, and it works. Simple as that. Danny Boyle's direction is also excellent it has to be said but most of that stems from the great script he had to work with.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender has been nominated for Best Actor in a Lead role at the Academy awards. He is indeed excellent. His performance is snappy and on point delivering the wonderfully written dialogue in convincing fashion. Sadly for him this is DiCaprio's year and no one is taking that award away from him. Kate WInslet has also been nominated for Best Supporting Actress. I didn't think she was overly impressive. She did her thing well enough but I was never blown away and there was no one scene that made me stand up and take notice. I don't think she's done enough to knock Alicia Vikander off her perch.<br/><br/>The wonderful pacing makes the two hour runtime fly by. Even if you don't have much of an interest in Steve Jobs and his story (like I don't overly) you can still enjoy it and get an insight into what the man was like. People can make up their own opinion on whether he was a good man or not. No one could deny he had his issues but they also couldn't deny there was a strong level of genius behind it all. Watch the film and make up your mind for yourself. You won't regret it."

Woz is better reflected but even that falls short and he is portrayed as little more than a geeky and weak persona which he was/is was more than.<br/><br/>However, it is the attempt to make the plot centre around a 'heroine' in Lisa Brennan-Jobs that lets it down.

There's only so much appetite for invading the lives of others so soon after their passing, especially when neither film is endorsed by family.<br/><br/>It just doesn't work. It's okay to pass a few hours as background viewing and there may be parts of it that reveal more of the man behind the brand than you've seen before, but fails to engage or have a single moment of real note.<br/><br/>Forgettable. Average. Both words I would imagine Mr Jobs would loathe to hear said about anything involving him. Sadly, they're fitting for this movie."

","All right, I can't understand this movie. Who was the target? Apple lovers, or haters? 90% of this movie was fiction, it is hardly real, and so random. Maybe the filmmakers read something about ""sugared water"", oh we should put this into. The same with Lisa, and Woz. Only the conflict, they have to appear right before the keynote, and tell the same every single time, and if we do this Jobs will appear to be and asshole. It is full with lies only for the drama (which is not a real drama, they weren't able to make it dramatic enough, they aren't brave enough for that) it was stopped all the time, and became a random stuff. Sculley proved for 10 minutes that he hadn't fired Jobs, but in the flashback, we clearly fired him. What about a Xeron conflict? Apple hadn't stole anything, just bought AND Xerox didn't need that stuff... The market analysis numbers absolute non-sense? Sell 1 million in the first Q, then almost nothing... what? At all, it wasn't real, and of the top of that, it was totally boring, and misleading..."

Jobs is known for his computers, iPod and iPhone. Very little time was spent about them. I was very disappointed about the total omission about the Apple hardware. Kate Winslet is playing the guard angel of Jobs. I have read three biographies about Job including his official. Nobody was guarding Steve Jobs or ordering him what to do. Jobs wasn't just a philosopher, he was a geek too. He knew programming but little engineering. The film has many inaccuracies. The Sharks of Silicon Valley was the best film about Jobs. Wosniac likes that film and Jobs invited the actor how played him in one of his keynotes."

","Basically another of Aaron Sorkin's Walk and Talk bits extended into a feature film. It felt exhausting listening to Sorkin's Steve Jobs caricature argue with Wozniak, his ex-girl and Scully for two hours. What a bore, what a waste of time. The only thing you take away from this is what a jackass Jobs was, which is accurate only in the context of this film, which brings us back to the sad truth that if you're getting your history/biography from the movies, you might as well be watching Fox News.<br/><br/>The movies are famous for their distortions of life and never more so than in this narrow little bio-pic of Jobs. Certainly Jobs was not a nice man. No one who ascends to his level of success is. It's not possible, but he was not served well or accurately with this ugly portrayal of a nasty individual. The focus is on his fractious relationship with Wozniak, Scully, his ex-girlfriend and his daughter.<br/><br/>I read the excellent book by Walter Isaacson that this movie is purportedly based on and this film captures about 1/10 of 1% of it. The biggest problem is that despite Jobs's fame, his life is not the stuff that makes for a feature film. Maybe a movie of the week, but let's face it folks, there's no real drama here, which is why Sorkin concentrated on the negative aspects of Jobs's life, his relationship with the aforementioned people. It's a distortion and a damned disappointing one.<br/><br/>The film moves along at a brisk pace due to Sorkin's trademark nonstop Walk and Talk which he perfected in The West Wing, but at the end of the movie you're left feeling like you wasted your time. My recommendation; read the book."

","I have thoroughly have enjoyed watching many of Steve Jobs actual product launches and reading the book by Walter Isaacson . <br/><br/>The movie had many problems: 1) the three act play was not conducive to a good story . it made the movie focus on 2-3 minor relationships and make it the focus of the movie . Steve and his daughter , while its great they reconciled having that as the thing to focus on about Steve Jobs life is a massive mistake . Having all these ridiculous events happen during product launches were not just not believable but they didn't work . <br/><br/>2) fastbender as jobs - I thought he was very poorly cast and did not think for one second this guy was Steve . <br/><br/>3) they focused on boring relationships <br/><br/>I felt the premise of the idea was similar to the Facebook movie in that you have an arc such as a law case and grow the movie from that. The problem was they didn't grow a movie . zuckerberg in the fb movie , we were shed an interesting light on how fb started . showing the life of Steve Jobs by showing 4-5 boring unrealistic relationships he had in his life is not the best use of material. <br/><br/>In close it was boring material ( and jobs life is so interesting that it's amazing all his real material was ignored ) and bad acting .Also lots of tech jargon that felt like they were just trying to shove in a few computer words to make it believable ."

"cnkaufmann","2","22","41","21 November 2015"," What were Sorkin and Boyle thinking when they made this?
","This film is nothing about Steve Jobs, Chairman of Appple Computer, as 99% of the public knew him. Imagine casting Pee-Wee Herman as Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather and you can get a sense of how badly cast Michael Fassbender was as Steve Jobs. Imagine showing just a glimpse of the newest Apple products on a stage in a packed auditorium of enthralled spectators without telling how Steve and Apple created them. Omitted is Steve Jobs' uncanny ability to create, drive for perfection, and his effective ""reality distortion field"" management methods (borrowed Star Trek). Imagine focusing a film about this brilliant and highly admired inventor on his rationale for refusing child support, when he's a millionaire, to his first wife instead of on the unique story of his extreme passion for building revolutionary products and his influential and antagonistic management tactics pushing his staff to achieve beyond their own expectations for greatness. Who cares about his personal life? How did he invent such great products? How did he motivate his employees and negotiate with companies to revolutionize multiple industries? How was he so innovative when other companies simply copied each other? How was the new Macintosh so ground-breaking for 1984 that no one knew how to write software for it? The subsequent low sales from lack of Mac applications and Steve's rebellious personality led to infighting at Apple and Jobs' firing. How was this so integral to Steve's success? These are questions I've asked myself since 1980 when I first learned of Apple Computer.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle could not have done a worse job if he had planned to, which does not do Steve Jobs nor Apple justice. Steve Jobs revolutionized the personal computer industry with the Apple II in 1977 and Macintosh in 1984, the music industry with iTunes and iPod in 2001, the telecommunications industry with the iPhone in 2007, the mobile computing and book industries with the iPad in 2010. Steve invented the desktop publishing industry with the Macintosh computer and new Laserwriter printer in 1985. He transformed the animated film industry with Pixar in 1995, when Toy Story was released. He married art and technology in ways no other person or company in history has done. He made technology accessible to everyday consumers through state-of-the-art electronics, remarkable forethought of market potential and simplicity of design. He brought Apple Computer, the company he founded and was famously fired from, back from the brink of bankruptcy to be the world leader in consumer electronics and one of the largest companies in the world. Apple's innovation was many years ahead of the leaders of the industries it expanded into. Through imagination and sheer will Steve influenced the entire telephone industry to change, the animated film industry to change, and the publishing of books to change. No one has had a more diverse impact on so many industries since Thomas Edison, who to this day still holds the record for most individual patents for inventions.<br/><br/>But Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin chose to ignore this since they believe the public is more interested in the soap opera drama of Steve Jobs private family life. Sorkin obviously fails to comprehend Walter Isaacson's biography on Steve Jobs. He obviously never saw one videotaped interview with him and he certainly never read a single magazine article about him. What terrible film preparation for a biography on such a remarkable inventor."
"DareDevilKid","7","10","16","18 February 2016"," A Job Partially Well Done
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3.5/5 stars<br/><br/>Though it'll undoubtedly have a more profound effect on those with a deeper knowledge of Apple's history or who share a fervent relationship with every product the company launches, ""Steve Jobs"" is nonetheless an affecting piece of cinema that boldly chooses a stark portrayal of the tech giant's late CEO without ever veering into the degradation or canonization of its eponymous subject. Set backstage at three iconic product launches and ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac, ""Steve Jobs"" takes us behind the scenes of Apple's digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of its cofounder.<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin's screenplay and Danny Boyle's Direction offers a Steve Jobs profile that doesn't idolize or criticize him, providing us valuable insight to the man's life and other important individuals who impacted it. But that insight feels incomplete and unrefined at various points in the film, because Sorkin's (usually impeccable) writing keeps treading into theatrical, garrulous, and, dare I say, even self-indulgent territory to metamorphose into a truly involving experience.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet create all the drama, intensity, conflict, and dynamism required to propel Aaron Sorkin's minimalist screenplay into grander terrain, but the film is simultaneously inspiring and frustrating, much like the individual it's based on. In particular, Fassbender's performance is a striking accomplishment of restraint merged seamlessly with command, as he portrays Jobs as a charming, amiable, and engrossing person in one scene, and a conflicted, revolting, contemptuous monster in the next. With due respect to all the other Oscar nominees this year, Fassbender deserves adulation for getting through stanzas of intricate, chatty dialogue alone. And, though, the movie never matches the caliber of its leading man's sublime performance, it's nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, inspiring and frustrating at the same time. Perhaps, more inspiring than it is frustrating, and that's still a pretty good thing."

","I have a question from Danny Boyle..why? Why? Really? What did you think when u were making this movie? Each phase of Steve Jobs's life can be a movie individually..you can talk about the Zen which creates the sense of simplicity in his mind which leads to the simplicity of the Apple products..but you didn't talk about that. The sense of liberation he pursuits when fighting with IBM..but you didn't talk about that. The hateful feelings he had with Bill Gates when stealing his ideas from him, but you didn't talk about it.The love of speed, but you didn't talk about it. I think the season 1 of Hault & Catch fire and role of Lee Pace was more like Steve Jobs than Danny Boyles' Jobs. What was Kate Winslet doing? She was portrayed as an secretary with ADD who just check the clock with Steve Jobs!!!! Where did you bring those interactions and dialogs with Lisa? Almost 60 minutes of the movie was about the dialogue between father and daughter which was fictional & wasn't so in reality and why portrait him as a cruel, egoist daddy. I would have become worst than him if the girl plays as Steve' Jobs daughter was my daughter too as she was walking on my nerves!<br/><br/>Anyway, I think the only thing that take me to see this movie to the end was Michael Fassbender's play which poor guy must have bear all the troubles of this movie with him."

All the conflicts in Jobs' life at each of those three pivotal times are dramatized as if revelatory conversations took place at that exact time, within the half- hour before the presentation. His conflicts come to heads: between Jobs and Scully, between Jobs and Wozniak, between Jobs and his the mother of his daughter, and between Jobs and his daughter Lisa. Jobs' conscience is a loyal assistant named Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslett). <br/><br/>I call it an ""art film"" because it is not really particularly entertaining, nor does portray Jobs' life as it really could have happened. It's a film that follows a scheme, and pushes the Jobs character forward, toward being a good human being, through each of his presentations. The film is all talk, and all Fassbender all the time. It's not designed for popular appeal.<br/><br/>I didn't really enjoy it, I was glad when it was over. Now I want to see how the Ashton Kutcher movie handled it, and the current documentary.<br/><br/>I'm not a partisan: I'm rather neutral toward Jobs--I use an iPhone and iTunes, but eschew the OS--I stick with Windows. From this objective point of view, I've got to say I think the portrayal was overly harsh, not balanced. The film uses Jobs' life to make its points about the need to be a good human. Jobs is the template--biography is not the point."

And of all the interesting stuff that did happen in his life, mostly behind closed doors, we get to listen to non-stop verbal diarrhea of monologues, which should pass for dialogues... but which are all too predictable and formulaic to be of any interest: every sentence is interrupted, questions are either ignored or answered with a sarcastic put-down and hardly anyone is listening to anyone. There is nothing to reveal anyone's motivation, no depth to any of the characters and whatever you see in the first few minutes gets repeated all the way to the end: maybe Jobs is a genius, maybe he is not, but lets see how he argues that point on and on; maybe he loves his daughter, maybe he does not; maybe he was responsible for those great products, maybe he was not... and so on. The whole movie is set in those few minutes before each famous Apple (and Next) product launch: first we see the 1984 product launch, then the next one, then the next one, and by the end, even Jobs himself says ""how come everyone is coming to talk to me just minutes before a product launch?"" Well, its because the script is simply awful. It was obviously written in a rush and the result is uninspired, shallow and pretentious film. Direction was no better and end result is something akin to the first Apple computer: useless (yes, the very first apple computer did not have any output, so it was actually useless)."

The writer and director have grabbed some of the most absurd and off-key moments of Steve Jobs life to create a dark and mythical character. <br/><br/>Why was the Mac great? Ignore that. Why was his push for design so important? Make that a negative. Why did he revolutionize the modern era? He was narrow and flawed. <br/><br/>This movie would have you believe the whole era of Apple was based on a few childhood fears and an obsession for working too much. At times, it felt like Steve Jobs was running for president and the writer and director ran the opposition campaign. Dark and negative without any window into to why he was great. <br/><br/>Good acting in a faux story that is focused on damaging a reputation of a visionary... this film was widely criticized and lost a lot of money... but it would have you believe Apple and Steve Jobs were the failure. <br/><br/>We liked the acting... to a degree. But the direction was terrible. It built up three key speeches and presentations that changed Steve Jobs and Apple and our lives.

Change the title and our historical knowledge of Steve Jobs and you just have a boring story of a man who was flawed. <br/><br/>Steve Jobs was flawed, but this film is far more flawed than he was in every way. I hope someone makes a biography that shares the real story."

Winslet and Rogen were cast for name value. Hundreds of actresses would have done a better job than Winslet. At least Seth looks the part. He's fat and has a beard. Cool.

"bob-the-movie-man","6","13","24","18 November 2015"," A bit of a wordy disappointment
","As someone who has worked in computing for 30 years, I was greatly looking forward to Danny Boyle's new 'biopic' (using the term fairly loosely) about Apple founder Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender). Whilst I can't claim it was a bad film, I was ultimately slightly disappointed by the result.<br/><br/>The film zeroes in on some specific snapshots of Jobs's career, all centred around his famously theatrical product launches. During the course of three acts we see the preparations leading up to his launch of the original Mackintosh, his Next educational 'cube' and the gloriously different iMac.<br/><br/>As these acts span 14 years, we see the ongoing battle between Jobs and the flaky mother of his daughter (Katherine Waterston). We also see the often despicable way in which he treats his staff, including disparaging his closest colleague and co-founder Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen). In fact the only person he shows much respect for – at least for a while – is his boss and CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels).<br/><br/>During these exchanges, it is difficult to find Jobs remotely likable. He is portrayed – probably very accurately – as a man with fixated views, unable and unwilling to bend at all. In this capacity Fassbender turns in a predictably classy performance.<br/><br/>Trying to pour oil on continually troubled waters is Jobs's PA Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), looking less like Kate Winslet than she has for a while. Winslet is the best thing in the film.<br/><br/>The script is by ""West Wing"" writer Aaron Sorkin, and it is extremely dense: I pity the poor couriers who had to deliver the screenplay to Fassbender and Winslet, and can only imagine the look on their faces when they realised they had to learn it all! And it is the script that is frustrating. I found the historical aspects of the roller-coaster ride of Jobs's career, supported by some great inserts of historical snippets by Arthur C Clarke and Bill Gates, fascinating. But the continual refocusing on the relationship with the daughter (Lisa) I found less compelling. And some of the right-angles taken by the dialogue strain credibility: when Sculley suddenly branches off into deep psychological counselling with Jobs on his childhood, minutes before a major presentation, it just doesn't ring true.<br/><br/>Above all, it was extremely frustrating that the story took you to the point in each act of an announcer saying ""And now let's welcome to the stage STEVE JOBS"" and then the action cut away to the next scene. You never got to see Fassbender let rip at channelling the famous Jobs charisma to his assembly of baying geek disciples.<br/><br/>While there are occasional snatches of Danny Boyle's usual flair, it views as a fairly atypical Boyle film: just getting all the dialogue in leaves little time for much stylised delivery.<br/><br/>So in summary its a workmanlike film but, for me, unfortunately one of the disappointments of the film year to date.<br/><br/>(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks.)"

After this iShout-Fest pretending to be a movie, my sympathy is with Steve Jobs. Odd, as the whole narrative tone attempted to hit the audience on the head to achieve exactly the opposite.<br/><br/>God Sorkin's didactic, shouty voice overwhelms this movie like an imposing, mean-spirited, nit-picky evil force. Sorkin is not known for subtlety, his new found Hollywood clout is also clouding his estimation of his true weight. Reality Distortion Field - what he accuses Steve Jobs for - has gotten to him. <br/><br/>God Sorkin's West Wing was special because then, the fast-talk-fest style thing was new. It got old quickly when he repeated the same formula on everything else. I remain neutral with his mediocre style until he first sunk is invasive, poisonous, blood-thirsty fangs into Zuckerberg in The Social Network. Now this.<br/><br/>For two hours we are presented with shouty, hard-hitting, captain obvious, unrealistic, GRATING LOUD ARGUMENTS - between (oh look isn't he so arrogant) Jobs and his (long-suffering) PA; (recalcitrant) Jobs with (poor little superpower) partners; (insensitive) Jobs talking down at his (poor little deprived) daughter. <br/><br/>The shouting matches ALWAYS take place back stage - always TENSE because Some Important Invention Is Going Gold and The Fans Are Cheering For Their Hero.

Sorkin's visualization of decent = amorphous and amoral. <br/><br/>And this is how Sorkin viewed an American hero, an artist-genius entrepreneur visionary of our time. Goodness, I'm not even American. Jobs may have been a flawed human who took for granted a few people close to him but he is not answerable to the whole human race for his personal failings. As if people haven't been bitching about Jobs's narcissism enough. As if that is the only legacy of a remarkable industrialist worthy of commenting in a multi-million production. <br/><br/>Sorkin's HIJACKING of an exceptional man's private life is so mean and petty, so invasive, merciless, smug, so unforgiving and high-handed, so condemning and god-like, so insulting of audience intelligence, so cringe-inducing esp during a particular Wozniak Jobs public stand-off. <br/><br/>I feel so sorry for Steve Jobs that I feel bad now I mocked my other's half's iEverything product tech specs. It's that bad.<br/><br/>Selfless chameleon Fassbender's amazing acting and Kate Winslet's equally sincere and generous offering managed to keep the horribly plastic formulaic script and painfully-contrived dialog bearable. After the movie ended, I asked, wow, what just happened. That's it? That's all the whole multi-million producer-writer team have to say about a man that define not just a generation but a renaissance? Family is Very Important? Really? Sorkin? America needs to be told THAT?<br/><br/>Hating and smearing Zuckerberg hasn't satiated Sorkin's blood lust apparently, all tech superstars are over-rated media darlings and private tyrants with awful domestic habits and must be brought to their knees and be publicly humiliated and accused with no evidence and bowed before god Sorkin. <br/><br/>Yes throwing rocks at super rich genius is easy. What's next? Sorkin tearing down Elon Musk or Bill Gates for some horrible crime of humanity against their neglected and deprived loved ones and co-workers? <br/><br/>After all this shameless god-playing charades Sorkin remains a third grade, one note pony screenwriter. Throw a rock on LA street you'll hit a TV writer with more flair and depth and less little meanie vengeance in his heart.<br/><br/>1 for Sorkin's shamelessness and megalomania.

","Despite the earnest performance of Michael Fassbender in the role of Steve Jobs, this film was no more successful that the previous failed biopic starring Ashton Kutcher.<br/><br/>The main problems were in scripting and direction. The film's opening scene depicted Steve Jobs in a heated conversation just before taking the stage to deliver one of his famous product promotions for Apple. Incredibly, the film simply recycled arguments and tantrums that occurred before the product launches.<br/><br/>In direction, the actors were forced to overlap their dialogue. It was not only difficult to follow the arguments, but it was unbelievable that the characters would sustain such rapid-fire banter. In life, people occasionally do interrupt one another. In the case of the this film, nearly the entire screenplay was performed with dialogue overlap.<br/><br/>In interpreting the character of Steve Jobs, it was unfortunate that the emphasis was on the insensitive side of Jobs. There was no attempt to tap into the creativity and the soul of the man. It would be like making a film about Thomas Edison with only nonstop haranguing of his family and employees.<br/><br/>The mercurial side of Steve Jobs is so well documented that the film turned into a cliché.

I really wish, Martin Scorcesse had taken on this project and delivered another of his outstanding documentaries, instead of this iTrainwreck. A quality documentary is all that is needed...not some major motion picture mired in 'poetic license'. Look what Scorcesse did for, 'The Band' in ""The Last Waltz"", breathtaking and his excellent job telling George Harrison's story...pure brilliance. Much more can be done with a documentary - instead we end up with some horrible iHollyweirdo-hit-piece. The story has a script solidified in jello. This thing is all over the place...scattered and emotionless. Mr Jobs was a giant of the computer age, not some fabricated monster, worthy of over-the-top verbal attacks by all who knew him. Flawed...well yes he was. It is sad that Mr. Wozniak did not possess fortitude enough to say how he felt, while Jobs was alive, but to applaud these one-on-one, made- up interfaces with Jobs as something great because it expressed how Woz felt??? It is a lie...most of these discussions never took place and Sorkin lowered them to some sub- Hollyweird level. Unlike many narcissists, Jobs actually tried to make a mends for his most heinous of actions. Was any mention of that in the movie? No...not accurately. His first wife was a loser and why she was even mentioned is beyond me. While I am on a roll, the casting is horrible. I guess I understand the disdain toward US born actors, but why this bunch. From beginning to end, I could not find Jobs anywhere, just an unconvincing portrayal by Fessbender. All emotional connect was missing, I did not care about Fessbender's heartless 'Jobs' at all. I truly despised the portrayal (although he is an outstanding actor). I think the entire project was approached as 'just another movie' or 'another day at the office.' This might be one reason, early on, so many people bailed on the project in the first place. Getting this unique personality correctly portrayed was going to be very difficult...and those actors identified as the best in their craft, recognized the challenge and backed away. Hands-down, Ashton Kutcher did a better job. And then there is Seth Rogen. He was actually OK, I just can't take him serious. Every time i saw him on screen, I was anticipating this guy to start announcing he was going to have sex...and right now or brag about getting drunk or high - not what I consider very 'Wozniakian' traits. Of course it was nice seeing Kate Winslet and Jeff Daniels, their talents truly brought something unneeded. Their characters are of no consequence, so why the pointless dialogue. This movie should have been an emotional yank at everyone's' heartstrings, but sadly it only ended up being a mean spirited, character assassination of a brilliant and troubled man. When Jobs passed away, I was very afraid that Apple's demise would follow closely...I still think it might. As good as Tim Cook may be, I sense his passion is not focused like Steve's. I may be wrong. Getting back to passion, passion is the element missing in this piece of work. This is sadly a missed opportunity and I really hope, since there are certain things they can never get right, Hollyweird respectfully lets the man rest in peace...and respect"

","The beautiful: This film had flavor: a hallway meeting was decorated by showing the launch of Skylab on the wall, the pouring rain outside during a board meeting was reflected on the ceiling, and narrowing the view of the media montage until it was the iconic -i-, the metaphor with the lilies that's the spice of movies, baby! The good: The book/script. How you could summarize all that convoluted history into the span of a movie and still make it extremely entertaining just blows my mind. This one was definitely 'on the page'.<br/><br/>The bad: The trailer. Did they capture their target audience? I only bothered with this one because it was 'her turn to pick' (and she loves her phone *rolls eyes*.) I also thought it curious that my Apple-fan family didn't mention the movie on social media, 'they' who have worked at or around the company since its inception, went to school with Wozniak's kids and won't shut up about whatever new i-Junk is going on now. Did this movie set them off? Probably.<br/><br/>The ugly: The inherent problem with the theater industry. It's all about getting rear-ends into seats. Entertaining the audience is another matter entirely. This movie was extremely entertaining but would not have gotten my rear-end into the seat had someone not dragged me to it.<br/><br/>The bottom line: This movie was such an awesome piece of film work that I'm going to go see it again for the movie magic, not for Steve Jobs, or Apple, or i-Whatever."
"sushant0406","4","20","42","21 December 2015"," Unnecessarily Disappointing.
","Positives<br/><br/>1. The 3-act presentation.<br/><br/>2. Jeff Daniels and Kate Winslet gave great performances. <br/><br/>3. The background score was really powerful<br/><br/>and was the sole reason of the tension created in a few scenes.<br/><br/>Negatives 1. Aaron Sorkin said in several interviews that this is not a biopic of Jobs. However, he did take several instances from his life and juxtaposed with even more unreal events. They were entertaining to watch, but made it a bit convoluted and it seemed as if the whole team was unsure as to whether they were trying to show a biopic or a fictional tale of Steve. While watching it , one knows throughout the whole time, that 80% of what is being shown is fictional. So, it all seems pointless.<br/><br/>2. Michael Fassbender is a very talented actor of his generation, but was terribly miscast.Firstly, as most of the people already know he looked nothing like Jobs in the first two acts and only partially so,in the last one. Second, he failed to embody Steve. Not for one second,did I think it was Jobs on the screen. It was basically Michael Fassbender playing a mean and self- centred version of himself, something that could have been done by any actor in the industry. But, the point was to play Jobs and to show his dark side, in doing which he was at best, partially successful. This too added to the whole feeling of pointlessness.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin dropped the ball on this one. Having the official biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Issacsson, as a dependable reference, they could have hit this one right out of the park. Unfortunately, it was not to be. Making a fictional movie on the life of a self-centered tech wizard who revolutionized the entire world, is never a good idea. For certain topics, the facts lay down the foundation towards making a good movie. It was because of this reason and his failure to present himself even remotely as Steve, that Fassbender's overall performance, in my opinion, has been over-hyped,thus far and is certainly not worthy of all the acclodes it has been receiving. He has given far more award deserving performances in Shame and Macbeth. However, there are several better and much more deserving performances this year, than this portrayal ."

","How could you make a movie about someone without casting an actor that resemble that person to a decent degree. Possibly this doesn't seem important to people who watched this movie, but it's extremely important to people like me that didn't watch it in theaters. I only saw the trailer and later tried watching a few more minutes online but gave up. And like millions of others, I didn't watch this movie in theaters only for this reason. Yet I'm posting this review because this fact is much more important than anything else about this movie, as it resulted in people not watching it, and disastrous losses for Universal Pictures and other studios involved. The trailer turned me off and outraged lots of people, and this needs to be clearly stated and understood. Danny Boyle, you were given an opportunity to create a great movie for the masses to see, yet you decided to create a movie for yourself, so that you can pat yourself on the back and win a few awards, while losing millions for your backers. I am eager to see any stories ***about Steve Jobs*** and this means exactly about HIM, not someone else visibly trying to pose as Jobs and looking fake. Yet Danny Boyle's narcissistic and selfish treatment of the subject resulted in a movie about Danny Boyle and for Danny Boyle, without any consideration for people who'd love to see a movie about Steve Jobs. To me just watching the trailer was cringe-worthy to the extent that I voted for this movie by not going to theaters to see it. And I truly believe that this is one of the worst movies of all time because if watching a trailer makes you not want to see the rest of movie then it's the same as walking out after 2 minutes of seeing your best stuff. Trying to watch it later online and giving up after a few more minutes only confirmed my concerns. It cannot get any worse."

","A few years ago I watched Danny Boyle's 127 HOURS and lamented that we are still to see Boyle's great masterwork . Credit to Boyle being interested in a story that wasn't very cinematic featuring a man trapped in one location which would make a great documentary of true life survival on the Discovery channel but doesn't lend itself to great cinema . With a biopic on Steve Jobs Boyle has his work cut out with this one especially since the narrative limits itself to three corporate launches and there's no way a director can use the language of cinema to tell a cinematic story if the foundations aren't there <br/><br/>To be fair Boyle does his very best to try and bring something to the table . He is one of the great technicians of cinema . The editing is fine as is the cinematography and he brings a few flourishes such as captions on walls . He also along with screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and actor Michael Fassbender bring a bit of character development to Steve Jobs . The central protagonist of 1984 is something of a rat who doesn't care about his ex-partner and the child they possibly had together and doesn't care about anyone except himself . By the time the end credits roll Jobs is if not likable then merely less unlikable <br/><br/>Many people have commentated that the concept probably belongs on a theater stage rather than a cinema screen and I'm inclined to agree . It's also difficult to empathise with a protagonist/antagonist whose function is to market products of corporate capitailism but since my favourite product I have is my I-pod I shouldn't really criticise too much"

This film however, reminds me of those annoying poser hipsters who worship Steve Jobs like a god. The man was flawed, but this film does nothing but enable Apple fanboys (not Apple fans, there is a difference), by pretending there was a method to his madness when he treated his daughter like sh!t. Or how Steve Jobs demanded Apple stop giving to charities. Or him abusing his employees on a daily basis. And basically this movie covers all that stuff up. Even the Ashton Kutcher Jobs movie had the balls to sort of tell the truth. This film however is a cop out. Michael Fassbender plays an awful Steve Jobs. He has the look but his voice is totally off and distracting at times. Seth Rogen pretty much plays himself for the hundredth time, no surprise. The film is shot well enough but the story is way too fictitious. His daughter is using a cassette player in the late 90s? Is this movie seriously trying to claim the world didn't have MP3 players before the iPod came out? I could go on and go."

","Another depiction of the life of the late founder of Apple inc. Steve Jobs. Honestly I've lost count how many actors have played him. Ashton Kutcher, Justin Long, Noah Wyle... and now Michael Fassbender.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender's physical appearance and way of acting was clearly a very bad choice. Made Jobs look like ...Magneto who was in a mission against humanity. I read that Fassbender called Christian Bale and ask him why isn't he who played Jobs in his place. Far better choice if you ask me...<br/><br/>In the script (written by Aaron Sorkin) Steve Wozniak (played by Josh Gad, ooops sorry Seth Rogen ! so many depictions of Woz too) asks Jobs rhetorically: You are not a programmer, you are not an engineer, you are not a designer yet everyone says you are a genius. What exactly do you do? Well, to answer the question he was the front man, the rock star. He sells (or something) to Apple fans everywhere. That's the obvious reason for the existence of this movie too.<br/><br/>In this version Jobs is more easily to hate. He is mean to everyone. Mean to his daughter and her mother, mean to technicians, a liar and a cheater who prefers to deceive the public that the Macintosh can speak. A terrible person.<br/><br/>The film is divided into three acts set in the lead-up to key product launches. I didn't like Danny Boyle's direction at all.<br/><br/>I doubt that people (especially out of the U.S.) will care much about this film. And maybe they shouldn't. The picture hasn't got much to offer to people who are out of the technology world.<br/><br/>For a more sold depiction of that era where the personal computers were born and for a broader look of that world, I suggest seek for the TV movie ""Pirates of Silicon Valley (1999)"". It hasmore substance (and a deeper view of the personality of Jobs) and it is faaar faaar more fun to watch!"

"classicalsteve","4","14","30","25 October 2015"," Unsatisfying Convulted Mish-Mash of Melodrama Overshadows Jobs' Accomplishments
","Very little about this film sheds light on who Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) really was, except as a self-centered egomaniac who has neither the time nor the inclination to treat either his family or his colleagues with any degree of respect or humanity. The screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (of West Wing fame) in one of his weaker efforts centers mostly and endlessly on confrontations with the people throughout Jobs' life, including among others, his estranged former girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston), his daughter Lisa Brennan-Jobs (Makenzie Moss, Ripley Sobo, Perla Haney-Jardine), Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen), former Apple CEO, John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), and long-time associate and confidante Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet). With every confrontation, Jobs, who was by all accounts enigmatic already, is yet more veiled, the drive behind Jobs less understood while the socially inept version is shown in spades. If I had questions about Jobs before the lights dimmed and the curtain raised, most weren't answered while others were brought to light by the time the curtain was drawn.<br/><br/>The film is divided into three acts, each at a computer convention launch of a new product. During the few minutes prior to his entrance onto the stage like a rock star to present his new computer product as a one-man soliloquy the audience has been awaiting anxiously for all day, Jobs engages in long and melodramatic discussions with many people in his inner circle: his former girlfriend Chrisann Brennan who gave birth to a daughter, Lisa, Steve Wozniak, John Scully, Joanna Hoffman, and others. Each episode is long and overdrawn, much like a soap opera where the screenwriters didn't know when to quit and kept adding more material. There are some flashbacks to important events, such as when Jobs ""courts"" John Scully into leaving Pepsi and working at Apple, and when the board decides to ""fire"" Jobs. Those scenes I wanted to see better developed with less about the fiery Jobs arguing with people in his private life.<br/><br/>The first act involves Jobs at the launch of his new computer, the Macintosh, at the Flint Centre in De Anza Community College. Only minutes before the presentation at the stage, the techs working on the computer have a problem: they're not sure if the Mac can say ""hello"". Jobs infuriated in true style berates their inabilities, particularly that of Andy Hertzfeld, but he refuses to postpone the launch a few minutes while the techs fix the problem. I have no issue with showing Jobs at his most confrontational which can be an effective window into his character, although even this initial tirade went on far too long. He rants and raves, then rants more, and it never seems to end. Every time Hertzfeld offers a solution, Jobs rejects it. After several back-and-forths, I understood; I didn't need it piled on.<br/><br/>Then he leaves the stage and wanders into his dressing room with only a half-hour before the launch speech. He's followed there by his long-time associate Joanna Hoffman. Eventually his former girlfriend Chrisann Brennan with their daughter Lisa enter the room and the film for the first time, which won't be the last. Once inside, Brennan lays into Jobs for being essentially a dead-beat dad, but Jobs refuses to acknowledge Lisa as their daughter. The problem I had with this sequence was my inability to believe the entire situation. Why would Jobs' former girlfriend confront him about possible alimony payments only minutes before perhaps the most important presentation of Jobs' career? Wouldn't this have happened in a bit more quiet and secluded setting, like an office or house? And why would Jobs let this confrontation occur in the first place while he's preparing to change the world of personal computing? And the ranting and raving goes on and on and on, with no breath or space. When Jobs finally goes on-stage, the scene fades and next we hear television and newspaper reports regarding how Jobs was ousted from Apple.<br/><br/>This is essentially how the entire film continues. Every ""act"" is a different product launching with people in Jobs' circle either berating him or trying to get him to see things in a different light. In the first act it was Brennan. In the second act John Scully has his turn and confronts Jobs about his new computer experiment, ""Next"", and they begin arguing about Jobs' ouster from Apple. And again, Jobs and Scully spare each other verbally, taking and offering jabs, trying to one-up the other. In the final sequence, Hoffman and an older Lisa get into the act and spare with him yet again. There are occasional flashbacks to other moments of Jobs' life, but many of those I wanted to see developed whereas the ranting and raving became old and repetitive. The one aspect I enjoyed the most was the relationship between Jobs and Hoffman who seems the only one who both understands him and willing to stand up to him despite she's essentially one of his underlings.<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin has made a career of lean writing in the political realm, particularly for ""A Few Good Men"" and ""The West Wing"". However, here Sorkin's abilities to create well-timed finite confrontations are put to the side in favor of melodrama. In the ""The West Wing"" confrontational scenes were never too long, and they never felt like melodrama. However, if melodrama was the device used to reveal the muddier sides of Jobs' character, it certainly succeeded, giving the impression that it's a minor miracle Jobs received any backing at all from techs and investors. The film spent so much time on Jobs' character flaws and very little on his innovative sides, the sides which demonstrated Jobs' genius for creating tantalizing products. I liken this film somewhat to ""Iron Lady"" about British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher which emphasized her dementia and deemphasized her rise in politics. Here, we saw Jobs, the insufferable egomaniac but little of Jobs the innovator, the creator and the visionary."

Even Beethoven, who was a true genius, and also something of a misanthrope, would not engage my interest were he portrayed in this manner.

"ClaytonDavis","7","18","41","5 October 2015"," 'Jobs' Proves Fassbender and Winslet's Worth
","There are dozens of things to truly admire about Danny Boyle's new film ""Steve Jobs,"" from its ambition to tell a compelling story about a famous man and the structure in which it decides to tell it. The initial casting of Academy Award nominee Michael Fassbender was criticized initially because some felt he was ""too good looking"" to interpret a man, who was essentially a computer nerd. By the film's third sequence, Fassbender fully melts into the role and delivers one of his most visceral and intriguing performances to date. What's equally measured to his work is the talent and ferocity of Academy Award winner Kate Winslet, who falls into a sympathetic, determined woman, whose conscious is complicit in witnessing vile behavior. Aaron Sorkin's script is a multitude of words and one- liners, and is just plain smart in its dialogue exchanges between its characters. And finally, Boyle himself has never been more reserved in his direction, letting the words flow through the screen like a tractor trailer through a corn field. He sits on the sidelines, only letting instances of his vivacious direction show its head, which may or may not be a plus for Boyle enthusiasts. With all this said, it sounds like just a romp at the movies. Then why am I left underwhelmed by the final product?<br/><br/>We have to begin with the story's narrative structure. Choosing three set pieces in 1984, 1988, and 1998 to show the progression of the film's characters was genius. We see a growth and progression to not just Steve Jobs, but the surrounding players in which are a part of his life. The film is jam-packed with wall-to-wall dialogue, something that is truly impressive to watch unfold in the moment, but hard to take in as key information and thoughts are being displayed. I needed some more beats, to take in, and disengage from the moment, to properly move on to the next. Its a movie that clearly needs two or three viewings to get everything from it. This may be its ultimate downfall. ""Steve Jobs"" demands so much of its viewer. Our attention, dedication, and fearless endowment to the characters and the moment. I'm not entirely certain that general audiences can do that for 122 minutes. It becomes a double-edged sword. Is it okay that a movie such as this exists that will require us to give repeated participation to fully understand everything it has to say and reveal or does a film only deserve one shot to say everything it wants to say? I'm not sure I have a clear answer to that but I feel comfortable that general audiences members probably feel more towards the latter. Sorkin's work is compelling, with vibrantly preyed upon dialogue that simply sings through the theater. Its surely one of his most ambitious efforts of his career, and likely something that will forward his progression as a screenwriter, even in his later years.<br/><br/>From a performance standpoint, the film stands near the top of ensembles and individualized works seen in 2015. Fassbender approaches Jobs with a familiarity, like he knows the man. He finds sarcasm to be a second language, and repugnancy to be a way of life. Boyle and Sorkin do very little to have Jobs redeem himself, as he continues to pile on immorality with repulsive, revolting behavior that may make you think twice before talking to ""Siri"" ever again. I can't recall a Lead Actor candidate this unlikable in quite some time. It's a tour-de-force to behold, and one that will surely place near the top of Oscar ballots, but I'd be lying if I say I was looking forward to spending time with the character ""Steve Jobs"" again.<br/><br/>What Fassbender benefits immensely from, is a squad of supporting players, each making their individual mark. Winslet firmly plants her feet next to ""Jobs,"" declaring herself as one of the finest actresses we have working today. Jeff Daniels as John Sculley is easily the most comfortable with the script's barrage of words. Daniels handles it with a defined purpose, delivering his best portrayal since ""The Squid and the Whale."" To a pleasant surprise, Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak is tenderly inserted, and holding back all his normal tics and signature mannerisms that have made him a star. It's a welcomed entry into serious and challenging roles in the actor's future. Staggeringly underused but equally effective as each of her castmates is Katherine Waterston as Chrisann Brennan, Jobs' high-school girlfriend and ""possible mother"" to his daughter, played by three talented child actresses, Makenzie Moss, Perla Haney-Jardine, and Ripley Sobo. The dynamic and vigorous Michael Stuhlbarg as Andy Hertzfeld is a sensation to watch, and will go down as one of the key players by a select group of movie-goers. Let's just call this a SAG Ensemble lock, shall we?<br/><br/>Boyle's market for his bombastic colors and dance sequences are sure to miss them because they are non-existent. It's great to see him taking a different approach to his storytelling, though letting running text play a role should feel familiar for many. What I found dizzying was the camera work by Alwin H. Küchler, who in the spirit of ""Birdman,"" has the audience constantly moving along with its constant walking characters. At one point, you want to just beg them to sit down and chill out for a second. Hats off to Elliot Graham's editing, who cuts to a commanding pace, even if more pauses would have been appreciated. What shines above all the technical merits is the score by Daniel Pemberton, orchestrating a symphony of music that swells in at the finest moments, and breathes new life into the work of composers everywhere. It was a truly remarkable piece of music that just flies off the screen."

I realized then that either this movie was going to be REALLY long or there was going to be some clever dramatic device to move the story forward. Well, yes there was a dramatic device, but clever? In a play yes, in a movie, hell no. The structural device is basically that all of the ultra important pivotal moments in Steve Jobs' life happen right before the launch of a new product. I gave a free pass the first time this happened, a quizzical maybe on the second and a ""come on, this is ridiculous."" on the third. If this device had been used in the play version of this film I would have been impressed since play stages are very limiting. But for a Hollywood movie with major stars it felt constricting, forced and ultimately unbelievable. Too bad. The performances (except Jeff Daniels' who for me always seems like he's acting) were great, especially Seth Rogen who I usually can't stand. Maybe he should stop trying to be funny and focus on more serious roles. I can't recommend this movie, except perhaps to aspiring playwrights."

Michael Fassbender doesn't start out a likely candidate to play Job's, however, his commitment to the character and later transformation is spot on.

Rounding out the top billing is ""it"" man of the hour (and consistently excellent) Jeff Daniels as Apple's headman John Sculley, and Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak.

","This is possibly the most entertaining movie I've seen all year. Steve Jobs has a meld of fast-paced dialog, flashy camera work, and stellar acting that keeps your mind occupied from start to finish. This is not to say that it is perfect, but it is one hell of an achievement<br/><br/>The film takes place in three parts, in three exposition halls, in the hours before three presentations of extreme importance to the title character. Flashbacks are drawn from occasionally, but most of the action takes place on those three individual days. It's a great tool for seeing characters develop. Rather than slowly show the transformation of a character as they live life, we see how a character has changed, and then are given insight as to why, and also get to see instantly how something effects a character years down the road. The main problem with the structure is the ""how the hell did so many things happen all at once?"" problem, which makes things occasionally unbelievable. This isn't a huge problem though, as this question can usually be calmed down due to the high stakes of each individual point in time.<br/><br/>If you're familiar with Aaron Sorkin's writing (The West Wing, The Social Network) you know he's got a whole thing going with incredibly clever and fast-paced dialog. Conversations flow like poetry, insults you wish you came up with hit you in your gut, and emotional moments come up at just the right points. The only problem is that it can sometimes be hard to believe that you're watching humans and not genetically engineered forensics champions. Maybe it's like the language of Shakespeare, needing to be accepted for its beauty rather than its realism, but, then again, this is based on recent history and I don't enjoy Shakespeare.<br/><br/>Finally, with such a attention-grabbing script and subject it's easy to forget this film was directed by Oscar-winning Danny Boyle. As with David Fincher on The Social Network, Boyle handles Sorkins script loyally, yet adds his own flares. There are a several beautifully composed shots, and a creative effect used a few times that I won't spoil. The look of the film fits perfectly and every actor (All fantastic, not much more to say about that) delivers their lines in a very fitting manner. I've heard some complaints, but I feel as if Danny Boyle couldn't have done a better job.<br/><br/>Overall, even if it's a bit over-theatrical movie, Steve Jobs is a blast to watch, and one of the best biopics of the decade so far."

","It is not bad, it is not good. A decent movie, that's it. For those who don't the history of Apple/steve jobs doesn't give more insights. For those who know it, I think it comes up as shallow.

It lacks the tridimension of the characters and those who are supposed to be 3D characters, like Kate winslet are utterly unrealistic.<br/><br/>Talking talking and more talking but where is the IT stuff?

So this is about a dish water blond guy that has issues with his daughter. geeze Jobs was more than that. people with a vision really don't do much else other than focus on their vision. family does go by the wayside. genius isn't usually a well rounded family guy. so i don't really care about his dysfunctional relationships with family members. i want content and someone that looks kinda like Jobs."

","It's difficult to review a film about a subject and time which I was so close to. So I tried, I really tried to suspend disbelief, give the writers of this turkey a fair amount of artistic license, try and concentrate on the positive, the sets, the costumes, lighting, sound, acting.... good God, anything! But there is nothing, nothing good about this episodic CBS drama less a cadaver and FBI task force cut to movie length I was charged $10 to see. For a moment though, I would like to comment on just how historically inaccurate this film is. Aaron Sorkin took the reality of one of the most interesting characters of our century and decided that that person, even though he had been commissioned to write his story, did not fit the cookie cutter, It's a Wonderful Life/ A Christmas Carol, mold he needed to appeal to his core audience of what appears to be 55 - 70 year old women, so he manufactures a thoroughly codependent female assistant whose quiet strength serves to tame the savage beast of conceit and misogyny. Boy, am I just getting started. I will not comment further on the factual stretches of this script, except to say has this been a Revolutionary War epic, Ben Franklin would have consulted Abraham Lincoln to determine how to react to King George's indifference. It's that bad, but unlike Mr. Sorkin, I have enough respect for the current colleagues and friends of the late Mr. Jobs to further plunder their personal history. Amadeus was a good film, it was entertaining and sad, funny, and a million other things, but it was never pandering, shallow, and embarrassing to all involved. To say Steve Jobs is as important to history, and as compelling a character as Mozart is not a stretch in my opinion. Mr. Sorkin, took this source material, and presented us with a very special two-hour West Wing/ Newsroom, what an absolute shame, and the fact that the filmgoing public with all the research at their fingertips at any time accepts this as alright, that they allow themselves to be duped into, to steal a Sorkism, a halcyonic state, is the biggest tragedy of all."

"zkonedog","10","5","9","27 February 2017"," Incredible Personality Treatise Of A Complex Individual
","A number of years ago, I watched ""The Social Network"" and was completely transfixed. I loved how that movie was able to tell a specific story (the origins of Facebook) and also serve as an excellent character study. When I heard that the same screenwriter (Aaron Sorkin) that did ""Social Network"" was on this project, I was obviously intrigued. The result is a movie just as good at examining real life events through the prism of drama and time (or hindsight). Perhaps even better, in certain ways, as it had less historical material to focus on and thus was truly about the man at its center.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Steve Jobs"" tells the story of its title character (played by Michale Fassbender) through three different product launches at three distinct times in his life. In each instance, Jobs verbally spars with personal assistant Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) and must deal with a family situation involving a child who he doesn't want to accept is his (Makenzie Moss, Ripley Sobo, & Perla Haney-Jardine) and an estranged wife (Katherine Waterston) who wants little to do with him but is sure glad to accept his bank deposits. Also explored are Jobs' relationships with fellow tech gurus such as Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogan), John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), and Andy Hertzfield (Michael Stuhlbarg).<br/><br/>As we all know, the real-life Steve Jobs was a very complicated, unique, and even polarizing figure (the guy once got kicked out of his own company, for crying out loud!). There is no doubt that he was quite a revolutionary thinker...yet pretty much everyone who worked for the man intimates that he was a class-A jerk with a slave-driver mentality. That is the main focus of this film, and it provides some of the movie's best moments. The film-makers really tackle the question of ""did Jobs have to be such a jerk in order to do what he did?"". That is fascinating discussion topic, and one that Sorkin and director Danny Boyle cut to the heart of with ""Steve Jobs"".<br/><br/>This is very much a ""talking film"", so if you are looking for a lot of action, you might have to temper expectations. To be honest, this is almost a completely dialogue-driven film. Fortunately, Sorkin has mastered the art of dialogue and uses it to full advantage here. There isn't a wasted scene, with every conversation a chance to dig a little deeper into the heart of Jobs the business man, Jobs the family man, and Jobs the individual. Though difficult to do right (as dialogue- heavy films can be disasters if not handled with a sense of energy), I'm a huge fan of this style of film-making. I know that ""show, not tell"" is usually the mantra of Hollywood, but when dealing with personalities I think that can be deviated from a bit.<br/><br/>To pull off all that dialogue, there needs to be great actors up on the screen, and ""Steve Jobs"" has that all-around. Fassbender is entrancing as Jobs, while the entire supporting cast is also excellent. Especially on-point is Rogen as Wozniak. His scenes with Fassbender are probably the best of the entire film, cutting to the heart of who Jobs was as an individual.<br/><br/>This movie opened to bad press and made little money (at least initially), and I think I know why: you can't go in expecting a cradle-to-grave biography. That's not what this movie sets out to do. It is a character study, plain and simple, just like ""The Social Network"" was really as much a character study of Mark Zuckerberg as it was a ""movie about Facebook"". ""Steve Jobs"" leans even more in that direction, as there is no ""one specific event"" that it can lean on. Instead, each behind-the-scenes of the product launch is intended to give glimpses into how Jobs handles different portions of his life in order to get to know him better. Obviously, some of the key details are filled in through monologues and flashbacks, but this is by now means anywhere near a comprehensive biography. That wasn't the point.<br/><br/>Overall, I consider ""Steve Jobs"" to be one of the most thought-provoking films I've seen at the cinema in quite some time. It can play to the nostalgia of Apple users, tech nostalgia in general, and tell a complex personality tale about one of the great technology icons of all-time. The themes espoused in the film will be kicking around in your noggin long after the lights cycle up and the credits roll."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Steve Jobs"" (2015) is an superbly acted and amazingly written picture, two great things that makes this movie in which not much actually happens a real joy to watch and to listen to. To be honest i'm not a fan of Steve Jobs, i barely knew his biography. That said i wasn't really looking forward for this movie, i actually even didn't really wanted to see it in the first place. Glad i did, because in the first place this is not a straightforward biopic - there are only few some segments from his life that are shown in this movie, it is more of ""right here right now"" stuff of biopic, it shows you man's portrait on the outside, not much of the inside. But as acting and writing goes, this is a top notch experience.<br/><br/>Overall, the great Aaron Sorkin, always superb Michael Fassbender and one of the kind Kate Winslet shines in this movie. No surprise Kate Winslet won Goden Globe for this movie, she steals every scene in this movie (before 1998 segment in my opinion). This is very good movie in which nothing really that happens, and yet because of once again the writing and acting you are glued to your screen during the whole time."
"jvic52","5","9","20","24 October 2015"," Less like a movie, more like a maddening play that tries to cram too much information
","I think a big part of not caring for this movie was that my whole life I was always under the impression that Steve Jobs was a nice, charismatic, humble, warm hearted individual... This movie flipped everything I thought I knew about this man on its head. Literally within the first 10 minutes of the film you find out that Jobs behind the scenes was actually extremely arrogant, rude, self- centered, inconsiderate, and hurtful. It completely blew my mind to find out that this whole time he was this horrible person. However, this was not the only reason I thought this movie wasn't good...<br/><br/>Plot: The plot of this movie primarily revolves around three different points in Jobs life. 1984 with the Macintosh computer launch, 1988 with the NEXT computer launch, and in 1998 when the i Mac was launched. Each of the three scenes felt rushed... I remember after watching the 1988 NEXT launch scene my head was literally spinning trying to digest all of the information. I am an avid movie goer, I am able to keep up with complex stories.... but during this scene they tried to cram WAY to much information into it. For those of you who have watched this movie it is the scene where Jeff Daniels and Fassbender are talking in the hallway that was mind numbing for me to watch. You almost have to go into this movie with some background knowledge on Jobs or you will be lost. It pretty much tried to explain how/why Jobs was fired from Apple in about a 4 minute summary. Although the movie felt rushed and too much was going on, I did enjoy the dialog. Steve Jobs was a witty man and had many sharp, humorous verbal jabs at many of his ""friends"". <br/><br/>Characters: Michael Fassbender will, and should be nominated for an Oscar for his performance. I don't think he will take it, but the fact that he did such a good job in his role is commendable. I mean by the end of this film I literally hated Steve Jobs... didn't feel bad for him, didn't sympathize with him, I hated him. <br/><br/>Seth Rogen played a very strong supporting role in this film. Many people were surprised that he could take on a serious part for a movie, but I wasn't too surprised. The people whom Rogen associates with in Hollywood all have the capability to play serious and comedic roles... Rogen, Jonah Hill, and James Franco all have that chameleon style acting where they will do well in any role they are given. <br/><br/>Kate Winslet will absolutely be a front runner for Best Supporting Actress.... I think she will win it as well. Her character development throughout the film was impressive to watch. Throughout the film it is really just Fassbender and Winslet that take on the majority of the scenes. <br/><br/>Overall: This film was just OK for me... it wasn't the best thing I've seen in years by any means. The movie did the best it could showing Jobs changing over the years with each of his failures. By the time the i Mac roles around in 1998 Jobs seemed to have calmed down a little bit, but underneath it all he was still a horrible person. He wasn't 100% all hate and evil.... he still did love and want to be loved. He was a complex man, a genius, but when it comes down to what really counts like being there for your family and friends, he wasn't. He was more interested in making sure he became famous as a world changing inventor."

I was lucky enough to view it at an advanced screening at my university, and it reminded me of everything that is good about film. I was struck again and again by how deeply and completely they managed to portray not only Jobs, but also other characters with far less screen time. (Rogen, in particular, shines as Wozniak.) Every single moment of this film is packed with emotion, and it skillfully darts from humorous to intense so quickly you'll spin in your seat."
"quinimdb","7","6","12","13 July 2016"," Steve Jobs
","The best biopics are the ones that show their subject as the flawed individual that they are while also showing how their particular flaws and strengths are what propelled them to greatness, and sometimes threw them back down. Take, for instance, ""Raging Bull"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Amadeus"", ""The Assassination of Jesse James"", and Sorkin's own ""The Social Network"". I'm happy to rank ""Steve Jobs"" among those films.<br/><br/>Okay, so maybe it's a gross exaggeration to call it quite as good as those films, but it gets pretty much everything right, and it is probably the best film of 2015. The film is structured as sort of a 3 act play, with each act taking place right before 3 very important reveals for Apple. Although rather than starting at the beginning of Steve's career, it starts at probably his worst decline in his career, starting with the Macintosh conference. The first thing that we learn about Steve is that he needs everything exactly the way he wants it, no matter the cost. He is desperately trying to get the computer to say ""hello"" only 45 minutes before the conference starts, even though the chief programmer tells him multiple times that it's impossible. We learn that Steve requires everything in his life to be under his control, which is why he doesn't want Wozniak to give the computer 8 slots, but 2 instead (""end to end control"") and it's why he pushes out his daughter, since he believes he can't control her (""Your sons and daughters are beyond your command""). This fear of lack of control seems to go all the way back to when Steve was an infant and was adopted not once, but twice. However, his love for his daughter does shine through in moments, because he is, after all a human. During the middle passage of the film, Steve has been fired from Apple and is now trying to create the ""black box"" at his new company, NEXT. At this point, he knows it's going to flop. He doesn't even have an OS ready for the conference, but rather a demo version of it. He is only starting to realize that he doesn't understand, as his daughter (and Jon Mitchell) puts it, ""life, love and clouds"". He is beginning to realize that everything is beyond his control. He now has even stronger feelings towards his daughter and when he gave money to his ex-wife, she spent it poorly. He was also fired from his job (in anew incredibly well written and edited scene) despite fighting hard against it, and even though it wasn't solely John Sculley's fault (in fact, he was just trying to let him off the hook easy), Steve pins it on Sculley, and refuses to apologize, because he didn't at least try to stand up for him. Still, Steve devises a plan to maintain control and it works. <br/><br/>This time, Steve Jobs is back at Apple and introducing his new product, the iMac. He has come full circle and back to the top with sales predicted at 1 million, but he still has things to sort out. He has a conversation with Andy Hertzfeldt, the man he was forcing to make the Mac talk at the beginning. Andy cares for Steve's wife and daughter, so he does the sensible thing and pays for Steve's daughter's tuition for college since Steve wouldn't do it because he took his ex wife selling the house that he paid for as a personal insult to him to him from his daughter when in reality it was simply because she is having a tough time financially. He is angry at him for ""acting like her father"", but Andy responds ""someone had to"". It only hardens the blow that Andy confesses to never liking Steve right after, and though he says he is indifferent as to whether people hate him or not, he seems upset. He also starts thinking about his daughter, and imagining talking to her. He then is shown by Joanna that the Time magazine at the beginning was never meant to be about him. He realizes that he is not always the center of attention and not everyone is out to get him. Next he is with Sculley, and now he realizes that he is not an efficient computer, but an inefficient human and he has to embrace his humanistic side because that is what he is and there is no escaping it. He even used to go to his birth father's restaurant but would never admit to it simply because it was only one more thing to worry about, a distraction in his eyes. It is then when he tries to make up with his daughter, ending in her yelling at him and exposing that he is just as flawed as the rest of us. She storms to the roof, and Steve Jobs follows. Like she predicted in the NEXT conference, his ""regretful"" song has started playing. He tells her that LISA wasn't a coincidence, and is far more interested in her than the important conference. He is even willing to be late to it so he can hear one of her essays, and it is specifically emphasized earlier in the film that being late to these is something he would never do, not by a second. It is now, because of her and his concern for her, that he comes up with the idea for the iPod. Then he walks out onto the stage, with his daughter watching in the background, again something he wouldn't allow before, and without saying a word, both literally (camera wise) and figuratively puts her into focus and starts walking towards her with his back to his computer and his business."

","I spent the first hour of the movie trying to find Steve Jobs in Michael Fassbender. He is such a nice actor, but when I watch a biographic movie I expect the actor to surprise me in the way that he looks like the real person. He isn't even close to Jobs' manners when he is young (1984). In the other hand, the dialogs are amazing and revealing about Jobs' life and relation to Lisa. The movie ends in a really beautiful way. Kate is amazing as Joana Hoffman and Seth Rogen shows his amazing acting skills playing Steve Wozniak, with the perfect tone of voice. The movie itself is about the moments right before Jobs' launches a new product. Loved the part when Jobs says to Lisa that he would put thousands of songs into her pocket, giving us the sense of the next innovations he had the opportunity to show the world. The movie makes you wonder how Apple would be without Jobs being so straight forward and if he treated people in a good way."

Depends who you are in the mix but for the majority of us it just so happened the person and product were a packaged deal and his inherent flaws were foreign to us.

","Steve Jobs. I was lowkey anticipating this film for a while ever since I learned that Aaron Sorkin was writing the script. Then when Michael Fassbender was announced as the lead, it really caught my attention. I just came out from seeing the movie, and I honestly thought the film was excellent. It was in my mind, a passionately made film that is a non-stop conversation. Very tense at times, it never leaves your attention. The performances, as well as the direction by Danny Boyle blended together almost perfectly with the story they were trying to tell. It almost works and feels like a short film. You get in late and get out early. You are immediately put into the successful Steve Job's world while he balances business differences and relationships, especially with his daughter. It doesn't slow down, and when it's finished, you want more. It is not a flawless film, but for what it wanted to be, it hit the nail right on the head. I haven't seen any of the other Steve Jobs films, not even the one with Kutcher. But even with that being so, I can say this was a great look into his life and Apple's success. A high recommend."

"vsks","9","8","18","27 October 2015"," The Rewards and Price of Never Settling for the Only OK
","This Danny Boyle biopic, with a screenplay by the rapid-fire Aaron Sorkin, may not be to everyone's taste, but I left the theater feeling both emotionally wrung out and strangely energized. Jobs was a complicated man, a visionary regarding the gestalt of the electronic world and the devices we use to interact with it. He was not a genius engineer or a software developer, and he was totally unsentimental (and unsympathetic) toward company products past their prime and the employees who worked on them. He never threw anyone a sop, or agreed with them just to get along. As a result, the movie delivers, as Village Voice reviewer Nick Schager says, ""a blistering barrage of combative dialog."" The decision to focus this movie around three product launches—rather than the endless quotidian details that led up to them—was, I think, brilliant. Emotions were at their peak, expectations were highest, and the parameters of success or failure clearest. No case of the dwindles here. The first launch—of the Macintosh—came shortly after the revolutionary 1984 Super Bowl spot and the audience arrived pumped with expectations. The Mac was overpriced and failed miserably, and Jobs lost his job. The second launch from Jobs's new company—the NeXT—was another flop. And the third, the 1998 introduction of the iMac? Well, the third time's the charm. Yes, he was impossibly demanding and ruthlessly critical, but would another personality, making subtle compromises all along the line have achieved as much? I did not read Walter Isaacson's eponymous 2011 biography, so was left with some questions about the balance of information presented. It would be obviously impossible to condense all the arguments, recriminations, and flashbacks we see on film into the final few minutes before a product launch—there wouldn't be time—but that was cinematic license. What I couldn't assess was whether his daughter Lisa was actually such a significant part of his life, though I understand the filmmakers' impulse to humanize him through his interactions with her; nor do I know whether Joanna Hoffman was really his conscience over such a long period of time. If so, I bow down in respect to her. The credits do indicate license was taken in fictionalizing some characters and events. Despite overall positive reviews—Variety calls it ""strikingly literate"" and ""a brilliant film,"" the movie is not doing well at the box office. Perhaps this is because the main character isn't seen as ""likeable""—in direct contrast to the Tom Hanks character in Bridge of Spies, reviewed here yesterday. Perhaps Michael Fassbender is not yet a bankable name, and ditto re Hanks. Certainly the cast was well up to the task. As Jobs, Fassbender is passionate about product and icy about people; Kate Winslet plays the long-suffering Hoffman with the slightest East European accent; Seth Rogen is the passed over Steve Wozniak; and Michael Stuhlbarg, the oft-berated, yet mostly bouncing back programmer Andy Hertzfeld. Jeff Daniels is John Sculley, who replaced Jobs as a more avuncular head of Apple and who, eventually, was fired himself as the company lurched toward bankruptcy. His departure paved the way for the emperor's triumphant return. The script includes some of Jobs's famous aspirational and inspirational quotes. I have one—not used—over my desk. It says ""Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life."" Words he clearly lived by."
"moviewizguy","10","11","27","14 October 2015"," Simply Masterful
","Is Steve Jobs the movie of the year? Obviously. Clearly. The first 30 minutes of the film itself is so well constructed from the writing, directing, performances, pacing, soundtrack, and editing that you are witnessing masters do what they do best. With the names of Boyle, Sorkin, Fassbender, and Winslet, would anyone expect less? No, I'm not saying these things because I love Apple products or I think Steve Jobs himself was a genius, a visionary. It's just the simple fact that the film is masterful in nearly every way. It puts to shame almost every film released this year and the previous ten years. It's that good.<br/><br/>Running at about two hours, the film feels like one, which is impressive considering it's essentially a bunch of scenes of people talking to each other. The film rarely feels slow and remains compelling to the very end, moving at an incredibly brisk pace. Not even The Social Network could pull that off. Then again, Steve Jobs is an entirely different beast, with the only similarities being their Sorkin-ess scripts. Everything else is unalike because Danny Boyle is a completely different director from David Fincher. Yeah, it would have been cool to see a Social Network reunion, but it's just as great to witness Boyle's distinct style overtake the screenplay. Again, these are masters who know their craft.<br/><br/>The performances are top notch, but of course they are. Michael Fassbender is a chameleon, transforming into the titular role of Steve Jobs. Sure, he doesn't look like Jobs but does it even matter when he's this good? Kate Winslet is alongside Fassbender through most of the film, and while her European accent comes in and out for a few scenes, she's fantastic. Other supporting roles range from good to great, including Michael Stuhlbarg and even Seth Rogen, but it is Perla Haney-Jardine who stands out as Jobs' daughter. She's in a small but nevertheless important section of the film and becomes instantly memorable in her limited screen time.<br/><br/>The success of the film isn't that it's about Jobs himself or the products that he made. In fact, Sorkin cleverly ditches the cradle to the grave biopic we've seen too many times and instead, focuses on Jobs' relationship with his daughter. It's an affecting storyline, tapping into the universal themes of family, love, wanting to be loved or, at the very least, acknowledged. It's the beating heart of Steve Jobs, the thing that keeps the film alive, and don't be surprised when you're crying by the end because you will. That, perhaps, might be the most surprising aspect of the film of all."
"leonblackwood","6","5","10","28 March 2016"," Great performances with an average storyline! 6/10
","Review: Everything that I have seen and heard about Steve Jobs, portrays him as an over controlling man with a bad attitude but you can't fault him for his amazing vision which has taken over the world. After his tragic death in 2011, at the age of 56, his company has still grown from strength to strength but his questionable methods and warped way of thinking, must have been difficult for the people around. Anyway, from an entertainment point of view, this film seemed very one toned and it felt like a group of conversations more than an deep insight behind the genius. The way that he talked to people and used vindictive tactics to get what he wanted, was truly horrible and he didn't really care about people's feelings. Even his daughter struggled to retain a decent relationship with Jobs but it was good to see that his trustee companion, Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), had the ability to bring him back to earth. Michael Fassbender played his role extremely well alongside Seth Rogen (Steve Wozniak) and Kate Winslet but the storyline seemed messy and I would have liked to have seen Steve Jobs, in his earlier years. I also would have liked to have seen real footage of the individuals that were in the movie and they should have shown how Apple has changed the world today. I still enjoyed watching how he built his company and the relationship between Jobs and his daughter, Lisa, who he disowned in her early years but I don't think that his amazing story has been portrayed with much depth to date. If I was his close friend or a part of his family, I wouldn't be happy with the way that these movies have portrayed Jobs, because none of them show his good side. Maybe he didn't have one! Anyway, it's a watchable movie but I was expecting more from this top class director. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Although Fassbender didn't look anything like Steve Jobs, over the 14 year period that the movie portrays, he still brought enormous intensity to the character, who seemed quite scary to be around. The music throughout the movie, suited the mood that was set by the director, Danny Boyle, 59 but I didn't quite understand why the whole film is based backstage, before Jobs is going to release a new computer. You can tell that Boyle has taken the events from a book, because it seemed more like a play than a movie. What's quite fascinating about the film, is that it proves that Jobs actually wasn't the engineer behind the many devices that was released under the Apple name but it was his unique vision and determination to get what he wanted, which has proved to be EXTREMELY successful. I was hoping to get more from the movie but I personally think that I need to watch the many documentaries to find out more about the mind behind the Apple brand.<br/><br/>Budget: $30million Worldwide Gross: $35million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/dramas starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels, Michael Stuhlbarg and Katherine Waterston. 6/10"
"Rumified","5","5","10","31 December 2015"," Brilliant Jobs? More like an asshole. But that's OK.
","If you're hoping this will be a biopic, it isn't. It doesn't even begin at any beginning of Jobs, but throws us directly into his first launches and sends us behind the scenes of their failures and fast forward to the first release of the iMac. And it ends with the foreshadowing of the iPod. So if you wanted to know how it all began, it doesn't exactly do that. <br/><br/>In fact the movie revolves around the launching of products, being behind the scenes before the curtain goes up, and gives us an idea of his character. His behavior, his condescending remarks and his displeasure of having a daughter name Lisa. What the movie does so well is show us an asshole Jobs, but try their best to justify his behavior so the audience doesn't feel like he's a total bad guy. Which he isn't. <br/><br/>But it doesn't change the fact that he is an asshole, even brilliant gifted man that have change the world can and have been assholes. That shouldn't take anything away from the man that is Jobs, but all his followers that worshiped him can't understand that simple fact. <br/><br/>I'm not quite sure what the movie wanted to say or its true intention, it is entertaining to watch him argue with those around him and be extremely arrogant of his ideas while belittling others. I think Wozniak said it best ""you're not a coder, you're not an engineer, just what do you do?"""

","Went to see the film in beautiful Castro theater. Throughout the whole film I kept looking for a protagonist. Someone I can relate to. You cannot relate to Steve Jobs because he is negative, horrible, user, manipulator and hurtful to everyone including his daughter and wife at all the times. I hate Steve Jobs after watching this film and it made me think that Mac/Apple was a product of an evil mind. I should never use these products. Steve Jobs keeps hurting all those people who are trying to help him. Good cinema gives the message of hope and love to its audience and I kept looking for it. I never found it. One little scene at the end wont do it. You keep sitting for 95 minutes to see some character talk about hope or love. There is none. I thought Kate Winslet character might show some hope. Aaron Sorkin and Danny Boyle were there at the screening. Someone asked about why Aaron portrayed Steve Jobs so horribly and he said this is the way he wanted to do it. He said he spent time with Steve Job's daughter to get more story elements. I think he should apologize to Steve Job's daughter as he did not show the girl in positive light till the last scene at the end. This movie does not deserve any Oscars. Michael Fassbinder and Kate Winslet were wasted in this film as they are good actors."
"istvandragos","9","6","13","30 December 2015"," A movie that thinks different and succeeds
","The movie succeeds because it's doing what the company founded by the eponymous character does the best, and that something is innovating. The company's slogan ""Think different"" perfectly fits the movie, because it distances itself from the Oscar bait biopics, by having an unusual structure, being composed of 3 real time parts, each one of them taking place before the launch of a product(1984-Machintosh, 1988-Nesxt Computer, 1998-The iMac) these parts are sometimes intersecting with some flashbacks that show Steve Jobs in some pivotal moments in his troubled life.The movie gives you the feel a theater play and this way everything feels more natural. Also the tension that is building up around the launches of the products is ascended with the help of this structure, forcing the characters to have real time reactions, making their reactions more believable. The actors are totally immersed in their roles and they are completely transformed. In an interview Steve Wozniak mentioned that watching the movie felt like watching themselves on a screen. I can't really tell how were all these people acting in real life, but I can guarantee you that the actors' transformations were marvelous. Another aspect that shines as always when the name of Aaron Sorkin is written on a movie, is the sharp dialogue, that perfectly fits it's surrounding events and contributes to the building of the tension. The direction of Danny Boyle stands out too, each part echoing not only the life of Steve Jobs, but the life in those periods too, each part being filmed with cameras specific for each period separately. The decor around the actors plays also a large role in echoing these periods of time. In conclusion I have to say that this movie really stands out of the crowd, most probably this is the reason why it flopped at the box office, but as time will pass people will be more aware of its genius and it will be hailed as an innovation like the many products that the fruit company has lunched."
"richard-1787","10","6","13","25 October 2015"," A remarkably well made movie
","Everything in this movie is well done - appropriate for a bio of a man who couldn't settle for less than perfection. The acting is all good, but Michael Fassbender's performance as Steve Jobs is certainly deserving of, at the least, an Oscar nomination. The man knows how to act with his face and his body.<br/><br/>If he gets that nomination/win, however, I hope he will go on forever thanking the cinematographer, Alwin Küchler. Especially in the last part of the movie, the way his face is lit against often light-blue backgrounds gives it an astounding, almost surreal quality. You see every bit of stubble on his chin, every pore on his face. But that face seems to glow, not like a 1930s diva, but like something that is not quite human. It is a fascinating light, but not a warm one.<br/><br/>Also deserving of at least an Oscar nomination is the director, Danny Boyle. Boyle wrote the book on pacing. This movie never flags. There are times when he flashes back and forth, very quickly, between present and past. Sometimes I caught what was going on, a few times I did not. My fault, not Boyle's.<br/><br/>The script, by Aaran Sorkin, certainly never plays down to the audience. You can see that he is the man who created those scenes in ""The West Wing"" where fast-paced dialogue is delivered by actors walking briskly down a hallway. He lets no grass grow under his actors' feet. My only problem with the script was the very end, which I felt bordered on the saccharine, after having been anything but that before.<br/><br/>This movie has no ""heart."" With the possible exception of those last few minutes, it will never give you the warm fuzzies. There is no one to like here, and really no one to sympathize with. But the goal of this movie is not to make you empathize with the characters, just as the last-minute explanation of Rosebud never makes you sympathize with Citizen Kane. It is to make you see and, perhaps, understand a very complex and driven man who played a significant role in the development of late twentieth-century technology. No, he did not create a tectonic shift in the universe, as he evidently believed, and no, the launching of his products were not the biggest thing in the century after D-Day. I was left, at the end, thinking that it was a good thing he was in technology, which was so divorced from anything human, since the human was definitely not his domain."
"bam_bino","3","7","16","23 December 2015"," Where's the drama?
","Everyone with even a slight interest in tech culture is familiar with the fact that Jobs wasn't a whiz programmer but a ""tech visionary"". This basically means he predicted what the masses really want, told other people to materialize it into pretty looking devices (minimally compatible with all others) which he advertised at conferences in an awkwardly pompous way. This is the singular distinguishing character trait of Steve Jobs in the minds of many people familiar with his biography - being a pompous megalomaniac. In this he shines like the North Star, his boldness and cheek are truly awe inspiring. The dude routinely compared himself to none other than Albert Einstein!<br/><br/>This trait should have been fertile ground for a plot full of gripping personal conflicts, but this is not what this movie manages (or wants?) to achieve. As the movie starts Jobs is already a millionaire, there are no serious obstacles to his business success. Even the failures he seems to take in stride, knowing he can't really fail. The biggest drama in the movie (along with Jobs getting fired) is his relationship with Wozniak. The conflict is punctuated by Wozniak attending Jobs's presentations and asking him to credit the team of Apple II, Jobs of course saying no, which of course seems plausible because why would you talk about a device that was made a zillion years ago when you present a new one. Even his relationship with his daughter is free of any serious conflict up until the end but then everything is easily resolved by his tech genius charm.<br/><br/>In addition to this, the viewer is treated to many lectures in Steve Jobs's business philosophy. I have many problems with this philosophy. In short, we are told to admire Jobs (instead of Wozniak) for being one to understand that ""computers are paintings"" - the concrete input of Jobs in the Apple II and other products is never explicitly shown in the movie. I was surprised that he can't even be credited with designing the damn things.<br/><br/>On the politics side, the movie has a very problematic streak in the way it portrays the character of Chrisann Brennan. She is depicted as a lazy gold digger hippie type scrounging off the great man's wealth with the pretext of caring for his love child. Supposing that some of the events are factually correct, if the writers cared about gender politics at all they wouldn't have embarrassed themselves by writing a character that is such a blatant misogynistic trope. Also it seems mind boggling that the only thing that is contested in the way Apple ran its business is the fact they used skinheads in one of their promotion videos? What about those Chinese sweatshops, Aaron?"
"Quinoa1984","8","7","16","27 October 2015"," ""It's warm and inviting and it needs to say HELLO!""
","The above line, which is the character Steve Jobs' (Fassbender) explanation for why the Macintosh computer at the unveiling in 1984, is his reasoning, and it's the first time we see him in the movie and his super-demanding-behind-the-scenes self. He has to have the computer say ""Hello"" to the audience that will assemble and see his prized innovation (which he didn't all innovate by the way, but neither here nor there, at least to Jobs), and it has to break down how people have been shown computer systems in Hollywood movies. His marketing manager cum surrogate mother, Joanna Hoffman (Winslet) remarks, ""The computer in 2001 said hello, too. It scared the s*** out of me."" There's another moment, a key one in a big, meaty exchange (what else does Sorkin love doing more) between Jobs and Wozniak in the auditorium in front of everybody, where Wozniak mentions that his products are better than the man who made them. Jobs agrees. Who is this a-hole? Our hero? Sort of, I guess.<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin once again gives us a guy who is a super-driven, I'll-do-it-MY-way-if-I-have-to self-professed genius, and perhaps it's hard to not think of Sorkin's script for The Social Network with his version of Mark Zuckerberg (whether he really is or not I leave up to you dear reader). I could make a very long blog post showing the differences, but I think it comes down to something more elemental: Social Network is about friendship, or what would-be friendship is and as it breaks down (or wasn't there to start), and Steve Jobs is about marriages. Jobs's marriage to Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marriage to Steve Wozniak, Jobs' marriage to Sculley, and even his sort of marriage to Any Herzfeld. But what about the woman who birthed his daughter (""She's not my daughter"", one of the major conflicts of the film), or being a father to his daughter? And like marriages - till death do us part sort of thing - the same arguments and same old BS gets pulled up over and over again, even as technology changes and people age and move on to other companies.<br/><br/>So we get three time frames here, which is clever until it becomes a little contrived. That sounds contradictory, but what I mean to say is that on the one hand, Sorkin and director Danny Boyle get to show something that a lot of biopics don't bother with when they go for the 'rise and fall' scenario - Jobs starts out at a point that is remarkable in 1984, about to launch the Macintosh computer, but with people all around him trying to get him to be... decent, to do the right things, to not keep doing s***y things (the Time magazine article, the Dylan lyrics signifying something, the mention for the Apple 2 people, the threat to Andy on the voice), and we see Steve interacting with everybody in the format that is what it is, a Backstage Melodrama. And yet we see the same arguments basically take place in 1988 and 1998. It IS the 'hard' parts of business/creative/personal ""marriages"". In short, this may or may not sound appealing.<br/><br/>I feel like I may need to see the movie again for certain little things; I'm still not fully sold that the ending (or at least the final five/ten minutes, his resolution with Sculley and Lisa) don't dip more than a bit into making this character sympathetic - and I don't mean that as a bad thing, but that it feels shallow in a certain way, as in 'we've spent all this time telling you this guy's a d***, many times over, but... maybe he's deep down a really good guy.' On the other hand, it may not be that clear, and as I think on the movie there's ambiguity to certain moments and scenes, and that's what sticks with me and makes me interested to see it again.<br/><br/>There's one little scene, where Jobs is talking to himself, softly, and repeating technical details on the iMac. Is he talking to himself to rehearse the lines - the actor as well as the ""player of the Orchestra"" as he puts it to Wozniak as what he *does*, which is still slightly vague by film's end aside from the aesthetic side - or is he genuinely concerned to get the tech stuff right, a nerd underneath the sleek exterior? Sorkin, I should mention again, loves gigantic, monumental confrontation scenes the way Ninja Turtles loves pizza; there are more than a few in this film, and a couple of them (Jobs and Sculley in 1988, Jobs and Wozniak in 1998) are the kind that become borderline too much to watch - the cutting back and forth in time is what makes it jarring in a good way, making the psychology and points of view distinct and interesting - but it's almost like Sorkin can't help himself, no restraint in the slightest. Nevertheless, Boyle and the producers got such a top shelf cast that even if this stuff was theatrical-grandstanding I'd be riveted. Fassbender, Winslet, Daniels, Waterston, and for sure Rogen (he's proved himself dramatically before, in Take This Waltz, and here he does it again) all pull off performances that make these words come alive and, really, human all around.<br/><br/>What I mean by that last thing is that, it's one thing to read Sorkin's words - he writes what he does, and you'll know it by know from Social Network or his TV shows - but what Fassbender does here is incredible. If there's sympathy that Jobs gets, it's not so much in the writing as it is through just him, finding that pulse beneath the cold 'genius'. And Winslet's Joanna as the 'conscience' is spectacular, and often because she's just the one trying to keep things moving/together. Jobs needs that - how else will he give any kind of 'face' ala the computer screen?"

","So, I just had the pleasure of seeing STEVE JOBS at the magnificent Arclight Cinemas in Hollywood last night... and I'm thrilled to say, it was absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin has outdone himself with an incredibly compelling script, structured around three crucial Apple product launches (each shot in 3 distinctive film formats) over the course of the visionary Jobs' storied career. Sorkin deftly manages to elevate the biopic past the genre's usual tired tropes to heights of Shakespearean high drama with his vivid characterizations of Jobs and a few key players in his complicated personal life, especially with his first daughter, Lisa.<br/><br/>The way Steve Jobs' troubled childhood shapes his difficult relationships and highly ambitious career later in life is portrayed with such disarming emotional truth that it finally offers us a realistic and likely accurate glimpse into the soul of such an elusive genius. He was, like all of us, a flawed human being, but now we can clearly see why he kept everyone at such a distance.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle's direction suits the material perfectly. His dizzyingly surreal style, with its dreamlike stream of consciousness imagery, adds greatly to the awe and wonder of the story... taking place mostly backstage before the famous product launch events, with a few brief, but meaningful flashbacks inserted at key moments throughout the film.<br/><br/>The four leads, it has to be said, are amazing as well. It doesn't matter that Michael Fassbender doesn't really look like Steve Jobs, because he embodies the man's spirit and persona so well, revealing a great depth of imperfect humanity behind a facade of perfectionism. Not surprisingly, Kate Winslet and Jeff Daniels also give masterful performances, and seeing Seth Rogen bring such vulnerability and pathos as Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is truly refreshing and a delight to watch. I see many Oscar nominations on the way...<br/><br/>Hopefully STEVE JOBS will begin a trend of biopics that put less emphasis on replicating the resemblance of famous figures and trying to portray as many events in their lives as possible and instead look to demystify the compelling journey and genuine emotional core that lie at the heart of every great story, fact or fiction."

This is strongly supported by a fantastic musical soundtrack from Daniel Pemberton. Where the film falls down (in my opinion), is in its structure. It has 3 segments: 1984 with the first release of the Mac, 1986 after the controversial firing of Jobs from his own company and his release of the NEXT computer and culminates in 1997 with his rise back to the top and release of the new IMac.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","4","8","9 December 2015"," A good film, not a great one
","After the not very successful Ashton Kutcher movie, this is Hollywood's newest take on late Apple CEO Steve Jobs. The director is Oscar winner Danny Boyle, the script comes from Oscar winner Aaron Sorkin and the cast includes Oscar nominee Michael Fassbender and Oscar winner Kate Winslet apart from Michael Stuhlbarg, Jeff Daniels and Seth Rogen. So it should not come as a surprise to anybody that this one is considered one of the big players this awards season.<br/><br/>The movie runs for 2 hours roughly, but I must say that I liked the second half more than the first. This film needed quite a while to really get going. I must say that I found everything before 1998 not too interesting. And even afterward there were discrepancies, for example how Winslet's and Stuhlbarg's characters were all of a sudden so important in Jobs' daughter's life, something that came a bit out of nowhere for me. Jobs' professional struggles with Apple make for the major dramatic moments of the film while the complicated relationship with his daughter is included for the emotion. His illness is not referenced, neither is his involvement with Pixar.<br/><br/>Fassbender gave a good performance and deserves an Oscar nomination. I am not so sure about the win, because a lot from his performance is also attributed to the excellent makeup work. Rogen had one great scene (his final argument with Jobs) and was solid for the rest of the film. Same goes for Stuhlbarg. Winslet had lots of screen time, but apart from how different she looked compared to her other performances these days, she wasn't memorable and should not receive any awards attention.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a solid movie. Fassbender is probably the best thing about it. I frequently have difficulties with how sterile Sorkin's scripts seem and here as well I just could not really feel any of the emotion, apart from the final rooftop scene maybe. But even this one occasionally only felt included for the sake of it, not really as part of a convincing storyline. I may be a bit biased as I couldn't care less about Apple (never had one of their products) or Jobs, but I don't think this is what kept me from really loving this film. It's just too much by the books for my taste. Still, I recommend it, even if I don't think it's considerably better than Kutcher's film. And my favorite Boyle film is still ""127 Hours""."
"Serge_Zehnder","8","4","8","3 November 2015"," Thou Shalt Have no Other Gods Before Me - Unless your Steve Jobs
","The deification of technology is the latest in a long line of religious antecedents that belong to man's evolution. So it's no surprise that at the heart of Aaron Sorkin and Danny Boyle's parable Steve Jobs"" lies a biblical Job with a contradictory message and the purest belief in technology as a force for good.<br/><br/>Boyle and Sorkin create a character out of a man that is from what one reads not a very accurate portrayal. Nevertheless, for the uninitiated viewer this hardly matters. One: Because they made a movie and two: Because Jobs himself may have been impossible to present as he truly was. What we get in this film, that sustains its momentum over the entire running time, is a talented, tortured and highly ambitious human being that tries to shape the future while negating his past. <br/><br/>Along the stellar performances by Michael Fassbender as Jobs, Kate Winslet as his marketing chief Joanna Hoffman, Seth Rogan as Steve Wozniak and Katherine Waterston as Job's former girlfriend Chrisann, are we entering three different product launch events from 1984 to 1998. A period which is broken up in three acts and works as a fluid play whose rapid-fire dialogue is augmented by carefully crafted visual extensions, precise camera angles and a very effective soundtrack by Daniel Pemberton.<br/><br/>The faith in technology that Jobs possessed in order to change our lives is very much evident, as well as his lack of many of the social skills that balance out a gift which drove him to all new heights.<br/><br/>Boyle and Sorkin focus on Jobs relationship between him and his daughter Lisa. And even if time-lines and events are shifted and invented, the final confrontations are moments of heartbreaking insight that reveal to us the segregating pain of creativity, its necessity and its elusive nature. For this Jobs reached for the stars and found the core of love amidst his life processor.<br/><br/>And yes, I believe that Steve Jobs was an unusual, frustrating and simply ingenious person that no movie or book can do justice. But sometimes it's not so much about how it was, but about how it feels. And this movie that bears his name has more than its share of palpable emotions that instead of simply inform actually enlighten."

Not to take away the excellent cast nor from Boyle's beautiful stylistic direction, but this movie was 90% Sorkin greatness. There were real historical elements and nods to Apple geeks, but for the most part the movie was thematic. Even if the events did not actually happen, the idea was ""if it did happen, what would Jobs do and how would Andy or Woz or Lisa or Joanna react?"" You have to read between all of Sorkin's lines to understand that this is not just about Jobs. It will make you want to look back into the real history and read the real stories and ask, ""how DID Jobs do it?"" Not alone, that's one answer. In the late 90s I had a Mac and everyone thought I was crazy because it wasn't compatible with anything. And I liked that. I guarantee almost all of them now have some sort of Apple product...Apple is always being criticized as a company but continues to succeed.

","(Rating: ☆☆☆☆ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is highly recommended. <br/><br/>In brief: An innovative biography that celebrates the power of words.<br/><br/>GRADE: A-<br/><br/>It is the words that speak louder than the actions in Danny Boyle's beautifully made film, Steve Jobs. The set-up of this character study avoids the biographical clichés that befall many in this genre. The art of the conversation and the poetic phrasing of the words created in Aaron Sorkin's perceptive script delineate each character brilliantly and directly defines their relationships. The movie succeeds in large part to the fine direction and a literate screenplay that elevates the film to an higher level of excellence that is rarely equaled in today's cinema.<br/><br/>￼Steve Jobs is divided into three very distinct chapters in Job's life and it is staged like a three act play: the introduction of MacIntosh personal computer (1984), the selling of his NeXT computer (1988), and the launch of the infamous IMac, his redemption project (1998). The film is a tad too theatrical in its presentation, although the director tries to camouflage this limited format with stylish imagery and archival footage that act as exposition between chapters.<br/><br/>Meant to resemble Citizen Kane in its concept: the story of one man's success and its corrupting influence of power and greed, the film is a worthy imitation. Where that film took the story of William Randolph Hearse and created a fictional character and plot that was thinly disguised from the real life counterpart, with names changed to protect the filmmaker, Orson Welles from a libel suit. Steve Jobs, the movie, welcomes the analogy and doesn't care to hide any pretense of this modern day successful corporate CEO's life.<br/><br/>￼Based of Walter Isaacson's best-selling biography, the film vividly depicts Jobs as a smart but unpleasant human being, willing to hurt anyone who attempts to connect to him emotionally. This includes his estranged daughter, Lisa. Again, it is Sorkin's dueling dialog that is razor sharp and fast as usual which impresses, as does the superior ensemble of actors involved.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen plays Steve Wozniak, a former friend and colleague who supported Job's many innovative ideas and wasn't afraid to say no to the man, A terrific Kate Winslet is Apple's head of marketing and Job's loyal Girl Friday. Katherine Waterston plays Chrisann Brennan, his ex- girlfriend and mother to his illegitimate daughter whom Jobs refused to acknowledge for most of her life, It is this fractured relationship that becomes the crux of the film and a sage method to inject some humanism into this cold remote loner. Jeff Daniels is John Sculley, the father figure that Jobs admired most of his life and Michael Stuhlbarg subtly impersonates Andy Hertzfeld, his technical assistant whom he repeatedly mistreats. All are superb. <br/><br/>￼Boyle's only misstep, and it is a major one, is his decision not to use any prosthetics and hair or make-up design to try to emulate Job's physical features. Michael Fassbender doesn't look anything like the man (until the film's final section), which I found to be a overt weakness in the role of a real iconic personality. (Life can be unfair, but not that unfair. Jobs may have been a gifted genius, but he never had this actor's handsomeness too!) The lack of physical attributes interferes with a strong central performance and kept me at a slight distance from the character. The transformation seemed incomplete, although Fassbender has enough charisma and gravitas to make us believe in the ruthless character he is portraying, just not in Steve Jobs, the actual man. <br/><br/>￼The actor shows Job's abusive and competitive nature full throttle as he subjects his co- workers and family to his self indulgent whims and petty rages. Job's drive for fame and his lust for perfectionism in an imperfect world show this unhappy man front and center, as written. But Mr. Fassbender effectively delivers the many complex speeches with great passion and aplomb. (Ashton Kutcher, who played Jobs in an earlier film, actually looks more like the title character than this actor, but it is Fassbender's interpretation of the role that essentially captures the inner flaws of a man unable to feel any real emotion.) It is a fearless performance.<br/><br/>￼Steve Jobs takes this arrogant control freak and savvy businessman and creates an in-depth character study that becomes riveting drama in the expert hands of its talented filmmakers. This is one of the year's best films and its eloquent screenplay is perfection. Do not miss this film. It's that good!<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
"perkolatorproductions","8","15","45","5 October 2015"," A Well Made and Acted, If At Times Painfully Pandering Biopic
","While Boyle and the phenomenal cast have done an excellent job as would be expected, the recent surge in mindless Macintosh support is a bit of a worrying trend world wide. The reason that Steve Jobs is an important figure in American history is not only for his most lucrative company in history's selection of widely known moderate quality, maximum priced products. It was that he set into motion the most destructive economic devolution in the modern age.<br/><br/>When Steve Jobs revitalized some old 1980s touch screen tech with a modern twist and called it an iPhone, it not only sent his then shakily rejoined company's stock skyrocketing, it sent the corporate community into the darkest depths of inhumanely dividend-driven depravity. With the ""Corporate Rights Movement""forcing an incorporated business to legally be considered a human being with similar rights, some of the most counter-productive, narcissistically psychopathic business practices since the Pinkertons (who still operate today) during the Industrial Revolution have occurred.<br/><br/>Where Wal-Mart and the Walton family got rich and famous on the ""Made in America"" campaign, nearly 90% of their products are manufactured by practically enslaved children in poor foreign nations with next to no basic human rights or labor laws today. Microsoft developed a patent/monopoly on the entire field of ""Software"" so they get endlessly paid for any newfound virtual program. Apple products that sell for thousands of dollars and function worse than much cheaper Windows computers are in bidding wars with desperate Chinese factories to be assembled and shipped for less than a cent per phone at times.<br/><br/>Then, as the corporations absorb billions in global profit, they attribute next to none of it back into their country of origin by keeping their massively excessive earnings in dozens of foreign nations with lower income taxes. Meanwhile, as they pay next to no taxes in the States to begin with, they have ""lobbied (bribed)"" our U.S. Congressmen to allow them to give them limitless ""campaign donations"" so that they increase taxes on taxpayers and decrease taxes on the super rich corporate CEOs. Even those CEOs who inherited their money from their parents, went bankrupt and were reimbursed by the taxpayers multiple times, like ""super rich, best jobs president"" Donald Trump.<br/><br/>Then they distract the public by forcing bi-partisan only mentality with no room for situational nuance or compromise to either absolutely love, or unwaveringly loath one company or another making ""Corporation fanboys"" needlessly angry and those they fight over very rich. ""PC vs. Mac,"" ""Microsoft vs. Sony,"" ""Republican vs. Democrat,""""Lib Dem vs. Torrie,"" ""White vs. Black,"" ""Male vs. Female,"" ""Straight vs. Gay,"" ""Hate vs. Love,"" ""War vs. Peace."" In the end, no one gets anything done, everyone's angry, and the only people who have any health wealth and happiness are those who screwed everyone else.<br/><br/>Technology is often very good, but nothing is any good to anyone unless you have factually documented, clearly observable evidence-backed knowledge of how it was made and whether or not it was humanely manufactured and distributed. Think for yourselves, don't let the ads think for you, everything has good and bad, nothing is worthless and nothing is flawless, life isn't all or nothing, people are just more complicated than that, it's why the world is so beautiful."
"actodea","6","5","11","2 February 2016"," A two hour commercial
","After going for Mark Zuckerberg fans and money, this time Aaron Sorkin went for Steve Jobs' fans and, of course, money. The movie is a two hour commercial for Apple, nicely done.<br/><br/>I do not understand why Danny Boyle accepted to direct this. Anyway, he did ti in style, creating a very nice and dynamic movie out of this commercial screenplay. Directing is just great. The cast does a great job, too.<br/><br/>It's a shame this kind of movies exist, made just for the money. However, I would not miss any of Danny Boyle's movies so I recommend watching it."
"pivic","4","5","11","5 January 2016"," Flawed but semi-interesting
","This is a boxed experience, by which it's clear whom has written it. Style can be great. This is intense, which is cool. It's convoluted. Can be very good. It's not complicated, but often a dirge in reverse; the dialogue is basically the same for all characters, which are all dressed differently. That's an issue that I dislike with Sorkin's films. Well, while a lot of people often behave similarly in real life, it's a murky feature to me, that stands out like broken pixels in a computer screen.<br/><br/>Having stated the above points, the film succeeds in displaying Jobs as a flawed person, but given all the hoo-hah that occurs during the film, due to everything happening during Apple events, it's hard to see his self. Well. I can't say I could or would have seen his self during other times, but the documentary ""Steve Jobs: The Man In The Machine"" gives much more flesh to Jobs' bones, where this film appears quite shallow. Good acting and, at times, stellar writing is interesting, but as a whole, this film does not work for me. It's scatterbrained, amidst all of its seemingly good intentions and radiance. I rather recommend the documentary to this film."

","Absolutely boring movie, i really can't believe it! I think it's even worse than then the one with Cutcher! It would be a shame if it gets nominated for anything. It's really ridiculous when i see the apple commercial of 1983 again - nowadays there should be another spot with all the brain dead-apple-zombies sitting in front of a new presentation and somebody else should throw a hammer into the whole system. Apple nowadays is just embarrassing! I'm really sorry cause I've once loved the company - before they penetrated every ""nowadays-movie"" with their logo! When you watch movies like ""This is 40"" or the new version of ""poltergeist"" it's not understandable why you get so penetrated with apple-logo, this has nothing to do with a healthy commercial. Wake up you i-zombies! Stop the Appledemic!"

","I've just seen this movie, so maybe I've not digested it enough yet. But what I find most troubling is, why is it so Lisa-heavy? Why this obsession with telling this version off Steve Jobs' tale? I was far more interested in the inner-workings of Apple and Steve Jobs brain, than his faulted relationship with his daughter. Call it the Steve Jobs - Lisa chronicles instead. Still, this movie was far better than ""that one"" with Demi Moores's ex...<br/><br/>The soundtrack blew me away, and Kate Winslet and Daniels were great. Michael Fassbender has been better, as has Michael Stuhlbarg. Seth Rogen as Woz was a welcome casting for me, although he still has a bit of ""ridiculousness"" that taints his dramatic moments for me."
"Turfseer","5","5","11","24 October 2015"," Director Boyle and Screenwriter Sorkin are guilty of celebrity worship in their fanciful portrait of ""tech guru"" Jobs
","Director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin want it both ways in their portrait of Steve Jobs: they're content to show him as an unlikable ""control freak"" but inexplicably conclude that Jobs was some kind of visionary. <br/><br/>Maybe Boyle and Sorkin's approach wouldn't be so reprehensible if they simply weren't content to stick to the basic facts about Jobs' life, but even Sorkin admits that his narrative is only very loosely based on true events and falls under the rubric of ""dramatic license.""<br/><br/>All the drama is bunched up during the three key ""product launches"" overseen by Jobs: the 1984 introduction of the MacIntosh, his NeXT ""Black Cube"" in 1988 and the slightly more successful iMac in 1998. <br/><br/>Much of what when on during these launches is fabricated to emphasize Jobs' intransigence or a prescient flip side. For example, the entire brouhaha about Jobs' purported threat to humiliate his programmer, Danny Herztfeld, if he couldn't get the computer to say ""hello"" within 40 minutes before the launch, never happened. Similarly, Joanna Hoffman's shock that special tools were needed to open the computer since it was a closed system, also was a bogus invention (do you really think anyone on the Apple team wouldn't have known about their own computer's internal parameters?) Even Jobs' daughter Lisa's ""abstract painting"" which supposedly induced him to pay more child support for ex-girlfriend Chrisann, was purely fictional. <br/><br/>Boyle and Sorkin would like us to believe that Jobs was a master seer, prophesying that he would be hired back by Apple after sabotaging his NeXT computer by introducing it without an operating system. According to ""steve-jobs-the-movie-11-things-that-arent-true-about-the-apple-co- founder"" by Rick Tetzeli at thefastcompany.com, the purported plan was that Apple then would turn around and offer Jobs control of the company after he finally developed an operating system. But Tetzeli informs that in 1988, Jobs ""had no reason to believe that this could—much less would— happen."" Eight years later Apple did buy the NeXT operating system but Jobs never predicted it.<br/><br/>The idea that Jobs became a big success at the time the iMac was introduced is another fiction designed to promulgate Jobs as some kind of visionary. The truth of the matter is that Apple didn't get into the black until the introduction of the iPod, not back in 1998 when Jobs introduced the iMac.<br/><br/>Boyle attempts to humanize Jobs by showing his dark side. In addition to the contemptuous way in which he treats his employees, Jobs also did a long number on his daughter, Lisa, by continually denying paternity in his puerile obsession to get even with his ex-girlfriend, Chrisann, whom he regarded as a bad mother. Due to the three scene ""product launch"" narrative utilized here, Chrisann is never seen in her native habitat and hardly is fleshed out as a multi-faceted character. What we do learn about her is from Jobs' biased diatribes. <br/><br/>More unforgivable is the simplicity in which Boyle handles the resolution of the father-daughter relationship. In the final scene, Jobs presents an ""I wasn't perfect"" mea culpa to his daughter. Did the Grinch mellow after all this time? Maybe so, but there's also the fact that Lisa spent time with Jobs' OTHER family, his wife and children that were never mentioned during the entire film. Boyle's format prevents us from understanding Lisa's complex attitudes toward her father and how they evolved over time.<br/><br/>If Sorkin has found any success, it's in his dramatizations of Jobs' confrontations with programmer Steve Wozniak, his assistant Joanna Hoffman and Apple Chairman John Sculley. The confrontation with Wozniak over Jobs refusing to honor the Apple 2 programmers before they're going to be fired at the iMac product launch, never happened according to Wozniak—but it's fine theater. Similarly, Hoffman's demand that Jobs apologize to Lisa for the years of abuse, tends to finally humanize the character played by Kate Winslet. Finally, perhaps the best scene, which alternates between past and present, is the clash between Sculley and Jobs, which fills us in why Sculley was forced to fire Jobs. The internal machinations at Apple prove to be fascinating, despite the stage play-like presentation. <br/><br/>What I believe has been lost here is Boyle and Sorkin's failure to truly humanize their subject. Jobs had a dark side but also charisma—without it I see no reason why he would have become so successful in the corporate world. What's missing is the sense of humor and perhaps the mellowing with age that some who knew Jobs have alluded to. <br/><br/>What's so odd about Boyle and Sorkins' treatment of Jobs is that they gingerly chronicle his bad points in his personal life and interpersonal relationships, but end up concluding that he wasn't such a bad guy after all. They also twist his history at Apple and give him much more credit due for the company's corporate success.<br/><br/>In the grand scheme of things, Boyle and Sorkin end up putting Jobs on a pedestal. In their eyes, he was some kind of visionary despite the bad boy outbursts--note their shot of the frenzied audience and thundering applause at the product launch, for the ""guru"" (Jobs thought of himself more as a music conductor like Seiji Ozawa).<br/><br/>In reality, Apple is just a company putting out products which may or may not serve humanity's march forward (if there is such a thing). Much has been written about whether computers help or hinder us. But there was nothing special about Jobs—yeah, he made a lot of money and had a bit of an odd personality. But he was no visionary. A computer is just a computer. More important is the fact that Jobs always needed to be in control, often treated people poorly and was consumed by his goal of success. A final shot of a cancer-ridden Jobs would have been more appropriate than the beaming ""guru"" at a podium, cheered by adoring sycophants."

","A flop at the box office and no wonder why!<br/><br/>If there is a character that could deliver a great story for a film is Jobs, having such good books and so many people that REALLY knew the man, Sorkin chose to focus in a lot of fiction and things that didn't even happen, even Woz commented that few things never happened.<br/><br/>It reminds me of ""abraham Lincoln vampire hunter"", my 12 year old liked it but he knew it was just fiction <br/><br/>Sorkin could have use information from ""becoming Steve Jobs"" a book a lot more accurate than any other out there.<br/><br/>Thanks god, and I mean it, that Sorkin didn't call Yukari Kane for consultancy!<br/><br/>So, if you are looking for a good fictional film, then its OK, a solid 7<br/><br/>If you wanted a balanced account and accurate film of Mr. Jobs, this film is a let down, for some of the good parts a solid 4.<br/><br/>If you want a solid biography then avoid the 2 feature films since his passing and do the effort and read ""becoming Steve jobs""<br/><br/>So the opportunity is open for a great Jobs film a few years from now, how Sorkin missed HIS opportunity is beyond me."

"joeravioli","9","2","3","15 October 2016"," Steve Jobs is fantastic. No, not Steve Jobs. The film is fantastic.
","You know you've watched a great film when you come out of it loving someone you've hated for the last decade. In my case, that happens to be Apple's legendary founder and quintessential non-techie tech mogul, Steve Jobs (and to a lesser extent, Seth Rogen, but that's not important). I hated Steve Jobs because I hate Apple and its ridiculous cult following, which I think is still perfectly justified. Apple sells terrible products that seem built to fall apart after a certain amount of time, almost as if every product is built with a detonator set to go off after two years, give or take. They look nice, but lack the processing power and ease of use that makes Windows computers pre-Windows 10 so much superior.<br/><br/>(Jarring P.S.: I'm laughing at the fact that I wrote this review before Samsung blew up)<br/><br/>Of course, now I'm jaded and curmudgeony (probably due to the ridiculous amount of time I spend on IMDb), so I probably hate Apple for no reason whatsoever.<br/><br/>The film, unlike Apple, is awesome. On the surface, it is a complex and intricate character exploration, not just of Jobs, but of those around him as they move forward in life. Digging deeper, it represents wonderfully wholesome cinema, the almost perfect use of two hours of screen time, never lagging or even pausing to catch a breath in a tightly-structured, dialogue-saturated quest to present and explore its titular character. <br/><br/>Sorkin's screenplay comes first and foremost in all respects. The narrative is divided into three small-scale sections, an unconventional and interesting little maneuver that makes the film shine with novelty. The dialogue is fantastic, although it does require an effort to keep up, especially if one isn't familiar with the names of Apple execs and staff in the late 80s. In a way, it's very much like All the President's Men in the way it hurtles along, forcing you to listen and think. Sorkin and Boyle don't care if they leave you behind. And trust me, we're much the better for it. <br/><br/>The performances are also notable, if slightly less than Sorkin's stunning screenplay. Fassbender completely disappears into the titular role, Winslet delivers flawlessly, and even Rogen pulls his (considerable) weight well beyond expectations. As a film propelled by dialogue rather than visuals, these elements cannot be ignored, but the actors themselves make it impossible to do so. They melt into their characters, creating believable, flawed, and really quite inspiring people.<br/><br/>I recommend Steve Jobs on all fronts -- as a character exploration, an intellectual exercise, and most importantly, an excellent film."

"extraordinarilyblue","5","1","1","20 January 2020"," An attempt at creating a ""new"" Jobs movie that left me a little bored and a little confused
","Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs is a valiant attempt to create a biopic in a new format, but in doing so it creates some challenges for the viewer.<br/><br/>The easiest way to make an audience automatically enjoy a movie is to create a long series of powerful, heart-wrenching, edge-of-your-seat moments. Some filmmakers grow tired of this method and try to make a new way of creating brilliant films. Danny Boyle through his Steve Jobs biopic attempts to do away with most of the major, iconic moments of Apple and its iconic founder. That means no dramatic engineering breakthroughs or genius moments from Jobs's past, which could be a serious let down for many expecting those.<br/><br/>Instead Boyle attempts to tell Jobs's hidden story through conversation, often with his assistant Joanna (wonderfully portrayed by Kate Winslet). Aspects of Jobs's personality are revealed through his words to coworkers and his daughter, Lisa.<br/><br/>This method of storytelling seems to go against the golden role of cinema: show, don't tell. Although many of the conversations include short vignette flashbacks, there are several moments where the viewer is left unsure of the true events. This is likely the intention of Boyle, letting the personalities of the characters take the lead role rather than the events themselves. Although the acting was excellent, I simply didn't care about events when I didn't have any knowledge of the truth. Additionally, I found several moments hard to follow due to the time-jumping nature of the three separate time periods.<br/><br/>The most interesting topic of the film for me was Jobs's relationship with his daughter and her mother. This was a story I have not heard before, and I felt a film solely focused on Jobs's family in this format would have been more interesting. The business end of the film for me became stale.<br/><br/>Overall, Steve Jobs left me a little disappointed with its focus on uninteresting aspects of Jobs's life and with its format which created viewing difficulties."

","A biography of the famous computer genius (played by Michael Fassbeneder) is played out in three different segments in 1984, 1988, and 1998. All segments involve a product launch with all the backstage tension that precedes presentations before huge audiences.<br/><br/>It is interesting that the screenwriter of this film, Aaron Sorkin, also wrote ""The Social Network"" (2011). Both films were about computer geniuses who had acted terribly toward other people.<br/><br/>Both films had the difficulty of making computer science interesting to the many who know little or nothing about it. ""The Social Network"" succeeded in ways that ""Steve Jobs"" does not. Mind you, there is less technical jargon needed to describe an interactive website than to describe a series of computers. Still, ""The Social Network"" used computer jargon as background against the bigger drama of greed and betrayal. ""Steve Jobs"" is overloaded with technical jargon to the point that it becomes difficult to care.<br/><br/>In one scene, Jobs confronts a former boss played by Jeff Daniels. Director Danny Boyle intercuts this scene with a flashback scene between the two that had involved a major conflict. The director and acting were great in this scene but it failed as the detail of their discussions were often difficult to follow.<br/><br/>There are many moments when someone is accusing Steve of being a jerk. Even if they may be right, the accusers all seem to be jerks as well. Despite the good acting, it is hard to really like or sympathize with anyone in this film except Steve's biological daughter whose unstable mother frequently wants more money from him.<br/><br/>The good team behind this film (which also includes Kate Winslet as Jobs' longtime colleague and friend) make it tempting to like the movie. But overall, it's a well-dressed mannequin."

","The Social Network meets Hamlet in this biopic that limits the action to three product launches in the early history of Apple. The whole film takes place indoors, except for a climatic scene of change and redemption that moves outdoors. This is the one directorial flourish in a film limited by its locations, and Sorkin's trademark need to have characters stand around barking eloquently at each other. The acting is very good, with Seth Rogan carrying particular appeal. The directing is straitjacketed in the limited locations. Sorkin's dialogue and characterisation, so finely done in The Social Network, does not stand up here. Everyone sounds like Sorkin, which one becomes weary of after a while. A different writer bringing more nuanced characterisation and idiosyncrasy to the dialogue might have served this project better."

","So, Steve Jobs is an ass. That's clearly well established in this movie called - somewhat unoriginally, but with precise definition, ""Steve Jobs."" I don't know if it's ever been proven to be true or not, but anecdotally at least, brilliant people are often socially inept at best, and do't do well with relationships. Jobs apparently managed to alienate almost everyone in his life - from his friends (most importantly Steve Wozniak, played by Seth Rogen) to his lover Chrisass Brennan (Katherine Waterston) to the daughter he spent years denying (played by different actresses at various ages) to pretty much anyone who ever worked for him or with him at Apple Computers. He wasn't a particularly nice guy. We spent two hours learning that - although there are quite a few people (including John Sculley, who became Apple CEO and is portrayed by Jeff Daniels) who argue that the portrayal of Jobs in the movie is unfair.<br/><br/>My basic complaint with the movie is that Jobs did, indeed, come across as extremely one dimensional. It felt as if I was watching a caricature of the man rather than a serious biography. Michael Fassbender played him - and did well enough - but I didn't come away from the movie feeling as if I knew much more about Jobs than I did coming into it and, except possibly for Lisa as she grows up with a father who refuses to acknowledge that he is her father, I really didn't much care for anyone or about anything in the movie. <br/><br/>There's some interesting material I guess about the growth of Apple and Jobs' other ventures leading up to his return to Apple and the ultimate reconciliation between Jobs and Lisa eventually gives you a bit of a heartwarming moment. But I really found this to be on the whole rather passionless and cold. (4/10)"

","Steve Jobs is a biographical film with a unique narrative. It showcases 3 moments of Jobs life. The Macintosh launch, the Next black cube launch and the imac launch. At each launch he interacts with 5 key characters. His partner in crime the genius Steve Wozniak, his work wife Joahanna Hoffman, his Father figure / Apple CEO John Sculley, his technician Andy (dont know which one) and his daughter Lisa. <br/><br/>While this narrative is able to showcase the trials and tribulations of his personal and professional life, it also reduces his life to 15 conversations which most probably did not really happen. <br/><br/>Some of these are really hard to care about particularly if you are not a Steve jobs or Apple fan. <br/><br/>While the acting by each actor is brilliant particularly Seth Rogen (maybe a career best and the only scenes worth remembering) and Kate Winslet (amazing as always), there are some conversations where I found myself laughing at the seriousness at which they were taken. Such as John sculley and jobs arguing about whether they should have put in the hard disk in a computer or not. I mean seriously who cares. <br/><br/>The narrative also handicaps Danny Boyle's trade mark style of quick action punctuated by an awesome OST and background. 
Its as if the entire weight of the film rests on the chemistry, the dialogue of those 15 conversations which are well as I said nothing really exciting. <br/><br/>This film is a perfect example of how bringing the best in the business may not be enough to create magic. Arguably the best screenplay writer in Hollywood, an Oscar winning director and a stellar cast about an ultra dramatic real life genius of our times still cannot make a great movie. <br/><br/>If you want to catch the making of a tech giant. Might as well re-watch The Social Network (ironically a superb script by the same Aaron Sorkin) also showcasing a rude, egoistical, selfish genius of our times. <br/><br/>Final recommendation : Skip this iBore and watch this only good scene of the movie <br/><br/><ul><li>KR </li></ul><br/><br/>PS On a personal note, I have never understood the charm of the apple products. I have always found them too much show and too little use. Further, they seem fuelled by blatant capitalism which makes people pay for things that can be got for cheaper and most probably not needed in life. But then that's my POV and i tried hard to not let it come in the way of the movie but maybe it did..."

","I'm not a blinkered Steve Jobs fanboy by any means, but this movie was such a one-dimensional character portrayal, it was to the extreme. We all know Jobs, especially the '75-85 Jobs was a petulant, cold, arrogant and notoriously difficult personality to work with. All of the nasty traits and stories were true, but he was a far more complex and multi dimensional personality than the sad, tired, one sided version that this movie perpetuates.<br/><br/>Fassbender does his best, he's a great actor, but sorry, he is horribly miss cast as Jobs, at no point did I believed him to be Steve Jobs for a second. There was not the look, style, mannerisms, speech, charm or charisma of Jobs. None of the inspiring leader, the innovative visionary that he most certainly was, nothing. The movie makers attempted to reveal more of the man behind the brand, a journey into his inner mind, his psyche, but instead we got a thoroughly repulsive, unlikable, sociopathic monster, who was apparently that 24/7...not to say he wasn't any of these at some point in time, but some perspective would have been more realistic. This movie would have been better suited as an overly dramatic stage play.<br/><br/>The equally great genius, Woz is sadly reduced to a geeky, weak, vision-less, accidental side kick, who's held at arms length. And to say in the movie that Jobs never respected Woz, and that he was 'just' an engineer? Absolute rubbish. Talk about fiction. Although small, another reference that's way off is Jobs saying to Lisa that the Sony Walkman is an ugly, useless brick. Jobs was literally OBSESSED with Sony and especially the Walkman, he had the highest respect and famously studied them to try and understand what made them great. Like the way he approached all of his products, movies made about him should be about getting the little details right.<br/><br/>Apparently this was based upon the biography of Jobs by Walter Isaacson, which is a very creative and highly dubious claim. I have read the book, and although far from perfect, and certainly not a documentary, Kutcher's portrayal of Jobs and his movie is a far better rendition of it. Factual inaccuracies riddle both movies, but I enjoyed the other 'Jobs' much more. It was more inline with 'Pirates of Silicon Valley' which Jobs and Woz both claimed were closest to the each of them and their story.<br/><br/>I get they were going for a 'deeper' insight into Steve Jobs character, but a more rounded, less one-dimensional rendition of the man, his impact and his very flawed genius would have been a better approach."

","The career and personal life of Apple founder Steve Jobs, told through three important product launch presentations from 1984, 88 and 98. We see how he got there, the ingenuity behind the products, what makes Jobs tick, the personal issues he was facing at the time and how he dealt with them.<br/><br/>This could easily have turned into a dry, linear biopic. The first Steve Jobs movie, Jobs (2013), was just that. Edifying but not overly interesting and quite unengaging. Certainly not helped by having a B-grade comedy actor (Ashton Kutcher) in the lead role.<br/><br/>However, this Steve Jobs movie is far from dry. It is highly engaging, through showing us the man behind the brand, warts and all. Michael Fassbender does a superb job in the lead role, mixing cold business acumen with vulnerability, empathy and warmth.<br/><br/>A very dialogue-filled movie, feeling much like a play, and this helps. The dialogue drives the plot and the character depth, and provides some good humour too.<br/><br/>On the negative side, the relationship and issues with his daughter feel a bit overwrought and overstated at times, but this is not a major issue.<br/><br/>In addition to Fassbender's superb performance, an excellent supporting performance too from Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman. Both Fassbender and Winslet received Oscar nominations. Good support too from Jeff Daniels, Michael Stuhlbarg and, very surprisingly, Seth Rogen. Rogen, more at home delivering comedy performances, is excellent here in a dramatic role, playing Steve Wozniak."

","This is not my usual type of film - I usually go for action pics. However, I watched this movie after seeing a number of the cast & crew interviews on You Tube and became intrigued.I was absolutely mesmerised by it and could not take my eyes off it. A number of reviews comment that the actors did not look like their real-life counterparts but quite honestly, I could not care less - the acting was amazing. Danny Boyle did say that an intelligent audience would deal with the fact that the actors were not impressionists in the first few minutes, but he obviously over-estimated the intelligence of the general population considering some of the comments. As for the script, I loved it. It reminded me of my English Literature classes many, many years ago where we studied the structure of plays and the use of language and I realised that this would be an excellent exemplar to study. The film was much funnier than I expected too and I am surprised this element has not been picked up by more people. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would highly recommend it."

","Avoids the pitfalls that ruined 'Jobs' with Ashton Kutcher, although his performance offered more verisimilitude than Fassbender's. The usual biopic tries and fails to tell the whole story: too many details are lost, so the resemblance is vague and filmmakers fill in the blanks with formula. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay for 'Steve Jobs' is limited to the scenes backstage at three of Job's product-launch keynotes, where Jobs finds himself harried by technical difficulties, paternity issues, conflicts with associates, and the fate of the computer industry. The extent of the dialogue gives the impression that these conversations definitely did not occur. They are used as a microcosm for everything that people know about Steve Jobs' character. Sorkin has obviously seen 'Jobs', and while this is a vastly better film, it doesn't contribute more to the understanding of the man if the viewer already knows (e.g.) that he was a control freak, a perfectionist, and a reluctant father. Since its deep focus doesn't achieve anything new, I might have preferred a film in which something happens. <br/><br/>The business world is usually boring. I never saw Steve Jobs as a hero, an anti-hero or a dramatic protagonist of any kind. He was a beleaguered tech CEO who had a second chance and brought his company from rags to riches. He could have been 'ahead of his time' in the eighties, but like this film shows, he wasn't an engineer, and his forward thinking could be reduced to his ignorance of what was practical given the state of development."

","Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution, to paint a portrait of the man at its epicenter. The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac.<br/><br/>Thismay be the most interesting way to tell the story of Steve Jobs. We see almost nothing about his life or who he was, other than what we get from his interactions with his daughter, his assistant and Steve Wozniack. Although it leaves a lot out, it is still surprisingly effective.<br/><br/>And what we have is a very limited arc, from failures to success. We never get beyond 1998, so there is no iPod, iPad, iPhone or any of the things that have since made Apple a giant in the tech field. But again, this makes for some interesting storytelling."

","I have to admit that I've been struck by the unexpected awesomeness of this movie that I don't actually quite figure out why it wasn't shortlisted for the Oscars' best picture and best screenplay, best this year, Though it already won The Golden Globe for best screenplay and best actress in a supporting role, it definitely deserved at least one Oscar trophy, it came much better than Jobs (2013) although it focused on a much shorter time frame.<br/><br/>Trying to compare this marvelous piece of creativity with the Oscar winner, Spotlight, makes more confused about the rules of nomination, I can put the comparison like this:<br/><br/>Screenplay: Both the two movies resembled true events but in two completely different approaches, Spotlight was dull and boring, it's actually closer to a ""documentary"" than a ""motion picture"", the story it showcased was critical and sensitive but the approach wasn't entertaining, it was just ""narrative"" as in a press reportage you can read in a newspaper or watch in National Geographic, while Steve Jobs was really entertaining, creative and attractive though it just showcased three moments in the life of the celebrity and was almost barred inside one location, the evolution of the main characters along with the three main chapters of the movie was perfectly synchronized and well studied to the smallest detail in terms of costumes, makeup, accessories, etc. Performance: Spotlight characters were mediocre, just OK but not spectacular except for Stanley Tucci who was really outstanding as usual, no other crew member achieved extraordinary performance, i think that was the outcome of the poor screenplay, in Steve Jobs, Seth Rogen made a spectacular role, Kate Winslet evolved to a completely new level of her career, Michael Fassbender, however, haven't impressed me that much but he did the complicated role very well. Music: Sound track of Steve Jobs was enthusiastic and emotional and played a supporting role in the overall atmosphere of the movie, Spotlight hardly even was accompanied by any music. I gave Steve Jobs 8/10 and Spotlight 6/10, I'm no critic or a professional, it's just my personal opinion as one of the audience."

","I'm not sure you can call Steve Jobs a biopic as such (did we really need another Jobs life story?) but it's certainly an intriguing and insightful look at a man and company that changed our future, for better or worse.<br/><br/>Going through countless pre-production changes where at times David Fincher was signed as director and actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Christian Bale circled the lead role in famed screenwriter Aaron Sorkin's story, Steve Jobs ended up falling into the lap of the recently faltering Danny Boyle who along with his cast give the film an energy and vibe not frequently found in such tales.<br/><br/>While those seeking a meaty and extensive look at both the life and times of Steve Jobs and Apple's rise to global dominance will be left wanting by this film, Boyle and Sorkin find success in focusing on pivotal moments in Jobs life that feel like they could be readily transported onto the stage in a film that is more stagey than movie in many respects but Boyle keeps the tension ramped up and come the films conclusion, emotion flowing and with a varied and committed cast Sorkin's words fly off the screen.<br/><br/>Winning the role at seemingly the last minute, Michael Fassbender may barely resemble Jobs physically but after watching Boyle's film it would be hard to image anyone else in the tight jeans and sneakers of Jobs as Fassbender's passion and ability to morph himself into a character allows his turn as Jobs to somehow grow in a fashion that come the film's final set piece will make you forget it is indeed the actor not the man himself standing in front of us. It's a brilliant turn and one that would likely seriously challenge Leonardo DiCaprio at the upcoming Oscars had Boyle's film been better received upon release.<br/><br/>With Fassbender the star of the ensemble there are also noteworthy turns provided by Kate Winslet as Job's offsider Joanna Hoffman, a thankfully dialled back Seth Rogen as the seemingly hard done by Steve Wozniak while Michael Stuhlberg and Jeff Daniels make their mark in somewhat limited screen time.<br/><br/>Held back somewhat by its focus on small yet no doubt significant moments of Jobs life, Boyle's film is a refreshingly unique biopic that feels as though it's been cut very much so from the same cloth as Sorkin's very own The Social Network, heavy on dialogue and reliant on actors to make the story fly.<br/><br/>Thankfully both Sorkin's scripting work and the ensemble lead by an arguably never better Fassbender make Steve Jobs a top notch production and a welcome return to form from Boyle.<br/><br/>4 important ""hellos"" out of 5"

","The movie, directed with customary panache by Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire), is a canny narrative told in three distinct acts, each involving the launch of a particular product and each presented in its own aesthetic style. The unveiling of the Macintosh in 1984 is shot on grainy 16mm film and scored with vintage synthesizers. The introduction of the NeXT computer, which took place in 1988 during Jobs's hiatus from Apple, uses 35mm film and a full orchestra. And the 1998 launch of the iMac, following his triumphant return to the company, is shot digitally and features a contemporary electronic score. The result is a film that almost advertises its own artificiality—Sorkin has been upfront about the fact that almost all of the dialogue is fictionalized—and, as such, one that's more akin to a stage play than to a conventional biopic. In the minutes preceding each product launch, Jobs (Michael Fassbender) interacts with a recurring array of friendly antagonists: his right-hand woman and ""work wife,"" Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet); the Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen); the onetime Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels); the engineer Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg); and Jobs's daughter, Lisa (played by three different actresses at different ages). I doubt I'll be the first to note the resemblance to A Christmas Carol and its ghosts of past, present, and future."

","Steve Jobs (the movie), not the person (or is it?) is the new biopic directed by Danny Boyle, written by Aaron Sorkin and stars Michael Fassbender as the titular Apple Mogul Steve Jobs. Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen and Jeff Daniels are also a part of the cast as Joanna Hoffman, Steve Wozniak and John Sculley respectively. It follows the life of Steve Jobs around three major product launches in 1984, 1988 and 1998.<br/><br/>If anyone was wanting a movie about the Apple company, then you'll be quite disappointed, but then again you would also be the one at fault for watching a movie called Steve Jobs and wanting more Apple. The first thing that you realize is the writing of the film and how inherently ""Aaron Sorkin"" it is. You may have become desensitized to the very ""talky"" way that Aaron Sorkin writes because of ""The Newsroom"", but for those who haven't watched the TV show, the sharp dialogue would be very noticeable with loads of walk and talk in true Sorkin esque fashion. This in combination with Danny Boyle's sharp direction results in a movie that rattles along towards its 122 min run time.<br/><br/>The star of the film however, is Michael Fassbender in this neurotic portrayal of Steve Jobs. This performance would come as a surprise, not because of Fassbender (who is undoubtedly a great actor), but for those who actually were not aware of Job's personality of being a total ass to anyone he had an encounter with (which I did not know). This includes family, close workers and even friends. The story is revolving around Job's denial of him fathering a daughter and ultimately shows how that relationship is resolved over a 14 year period. <br/><br/>The other supporting performances are absolutely great. Kate Winslet ever so good in another dramatic role who really is the only character that is able to sort of reign in Jobs. Seth Rogen was the surprise as Woz who was able to break out of his comedic shell and really held his own in his dramatic role. Jeff Daniels is once again in full Will McAvoy form from ""The Newsroom"" and that has everything to do with being around another Aaron Sorkin script and having three years of practice on how to deliver Sorkin's lines. <br/><br/>This film is all about the performance of Michael Fassbender, who is sure to get a Best Actor nomination from the Academy, but it has a lot to do with the direction and the script of the movie. The plot does become repetitive within the three time points where you can sort of guess how each specific third of the movie will move along. However, the relationships between the characters and the dialogue (mostly due to Sorkin) are great, but it is a mish mash of three points put together and doesn't really become rounded by the end. <br/><br/>Steve Jobs gets a grade of B+"
"subxerogravity","7","8","23","12 October 2015"," Very good portrait of Steve Jobs, well crafted and well acted.
","It seems like just yesterday that the movie, Jobs starring Ashton Kutcher hit the big screen, and we already have another movie about the creator of Apple.<br/><br/>The biggest difference, other than the fact that Steve jobs had a better stable of filmmakers is that Jobs was about the man who created Apple, and Steve Jobs was about... Steve Jobs.<br/><br/>It was more of a profile on Jobs than it was a biopic. What help sell this for me was the fact that the majority of the movie happens in three different Auditoriums at three different periods in Jobs life: the launch of the Mac, the launch of the Next black cube, and the Launch of the iMac. While jobs prepares to wow the world, he has conversations with important people in his life, like his astray daughter, Steve Wozniak(the man who actually built the machine), and Joanna Hoffman his secretary. It worked like a play, but did not feel like one, thanks to the flashbacks used to paint a full picture of what's going on.<br/><br/>Though it was directed by Danny Boyle, this feels so much like Aaron Sorkin, as it has a similar tone as The Social Network, not just in vague similarities between Jobs and Zuckerberg, but the telling of the stories as well. I feel like Sorkin did a better job of balancing the line of genius and jerk with the social Network than he did with Steve Jobs, because what I mostly saw here was jerk.<br/><br/>Does not help that Michael Fassbender played Jobs (Too many similarities between Jobs and Magneto). It was a great performance, I did see the genius of Steve Jobs, but I also so how he let being right, stop him from doing the right thing. Fassbender's interactions with other actors only did a service to them. My favorite was his conversations with Jeff Bridges, who played John Sculley, the CEO of Apple. <br/><br/>It was a different kind of movie about a man who thinks different, and I like how Steve Jobs seem to completely avoid the narrative story that drove Jobs and focus on the man. It's too bad this focus does not paint the genius in the most kindest light, so those of you who worship your iPhone may dislike like it like Christians dislike the Passion of the Christ, but for those who like straight up good acting, this is for you."

As I said, on a technical level the film is a marvel and you're also going to witness one of the greatest performances of the year but at the same time there was just something that didn't sit right. I'm honestly not sure what it was but there was something here that prevented the movie from being what I'd consider great.<br/><br/>I really loved Sorkin's screenplay and especially the dialogue. There's a lot of ""intelligent"" stuff being talked about and I liked the fact that they really didn't dumb anything down or try to make the film appeal to more mainstream crowds. I really thought the film broke down into four thirty-minute short films with each of them based around a various launch. Each launch also deals with the same thing and that's to show that Jobs really wasn't a very likable guy. Whether it was not being a good father or not being good to the mother of his child, the film doesn't hold back any punches. In fact, STEVE JOBS main goal appears to show how flawed the man was.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about the film is without question the performance from Fassbender. This role was rumored to be with many different actors but Fassbender certainly makes it his own and there's not a single second where you're seeing an actor doing a performance. Even though he doesn't look like Jobs the actor certainly becomes the character and makes you believe everything you're seeing. Kate Winslet is also wonderful in her head-to-head battles with Jobs and I thought her and Fassbender were excellent playing off one another. Seth Rogan and Jeff Daniels are both good in their supporting roles as well.<br/><br/>The film has a terrific, fast-paced style that director Boyle perfectly nails and I thought his directing skills were perfect for the screenplay.

","Michael Fassbender does a wonderful job in portraying the film's protagonist, it is true, but JOBS is not a good movie.<br/><br/>To say that Aaron Sorkin's screenplay incorporates clichés is something of an understatement. Kate Winslet spends most of her time looking pained as Jobs's long-suffering personal assistant, as he refuses to listen to anything she says. As his daughter Lisa, Perla Haney- Jardine has the unenviable task of trying to portray a character attracted to her father yet unable to get close to him. The script has a climactic reconciliation sequence between the two of them taking place on a roof on a sunny San Francisco day - the scene is deserted except for the two of them. All we need is a syrupy Miklos Rosza score and we are right back in Hollywood weepie territory.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle's directorial style is notable for its repetitiveness. Most of the action takes place backstage at the various theaters where Jobs launched his products, and consists of lengthy tracking shots as the characters walk up and down corridors, apparently unwilling or unable to keep still.<br/><br/>Jobs is portrayed as a thoroughly unsavory character, someone so wrapped up in his self-belief that he manages to alienate just about everyone. This is fine; but one wonders why his closest acolytes choose to stay close to him. The reconciliation scene between Jobs and John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) is pure corn: no one who had been treated as badly as Apple's former CEO would have tolerated such petulance, even from one as talented as Jobs.<br/><br/>The movie is interminably long and talky; Fassbender delivers most of his lines in a shrill whine, which becomes extremely tiring after a while. JOBS is the kind of movie that will garner Oscar nominations, but is in truth not very good."
"Jerghal","5","3","6","5 February 2016"," We should be making movies about great men, not scumbag computer-salesmen
","I was actually expecting it to be good, or at least a lot better then the stupid 'Jobs' flick with Kutcher. It's directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. These guys have proved to be some of the most majorly talented people in Hollywood. Here's the problem: they were trying to find the human angle in a biopic about a guy mostly remembered for his company or the products it cranked out. This angle is his daughter Lisa. To glue it all together they use the product launches of 3 major Apple products as a backdrop. On paper that might have sounded quite brilliant but in reality it's not. Why not? Because Steve Jobs was an asshole. The film does not try to sweep that under the carpet, no sir. It actually is quite proactive in correctly pointing out what a miscreant Mr. Jobs is/was. Jobs never gave credit where credit was due (Woz asks Steve to acknowledge the Apple 2 team and he refuses - several times), he was a tyrant who pressured people unto creating (supposedly) great things while he himself did nothing (he explains that in the films as being the orchestrator and the engineers are the orchestra). There is a scene with Woz (he did always seem to be the most rational guy in the movie as well as in real life) where he says to Steve Jobs: You can't write code. You're not an engineer. You're not a designer. You can't put a hammer to a nail. Jobs was just a Snake Oil salesman, he did not change the world. He did not even made revolutionary products, he made things that smarter people thought of before, and he stole it and marketed them as his own. The thing that should make him more human (the relationship with his daughter) makes him come off as an even bigger douchebag. He denies being her father (knowing full well he is), is not very friendly to her or her mother. Refuses to pay her 25K $ tuition while he has millions in the bank. Look, I understand biopics about great people who accomplished great things need to be made, but here's the reason why I dislike this movie despite them not holding back on showing Jobs' unpleasant side: he does NOT deserve it. Steve Jobs was no creative genius, nor a good father or even a pleasant guy. He was a bully who pushed people with much more skill then him to make a product he presented as being his brainchild. Steve Jobs sold himself as much as his products by giving no-one credit. But are these the sort of people we want to make films about? I don't think so. And the human angle...sorry but the film turned out to be an overly long yammering sessions between Jobs and his wife, daughter and coworkers. And instead of feeling compassion or even empathy for this scumbag, I felt contempt and boredom. This is not the sort of films we want to give Oscars to, I don't care who made them or played in them. This film (at the moment of writing) made even less money than the Kutchter vehicle 'Jobs', which clearly points out people DO NOT care about egomaniac 'creative geniuses' like Jobs. Heck, 2 days after he croaked the world had already forgotten him."

So it was really frustrating to sit through, watching Steve being mean to everyone. <br/><br/>And FINALLY, when he was about to step onto the stage, we got cut off. I went to watch this movie expecting to see different sides of Steve, including how he shines on stage. But I feel like the creators took that away from us, and instead focused on Steve being an a--hole. The movie in the end DID show a softer side of Steve, but I still don't feel it was enough to justify him as a person, because I felt like the negative side of him was portrayed way too much in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall I found this movie really frustrating to watch and felt like it wasn't worth my time at all."

It feels like a redemption movie but Steve Jobs wasn't that bad as to make the point. He was a businessman and acted like most successful driven people do.

My admiration and respect for Fassbender and Daniels still keeps me in the movie, but the musical score, overly dramatic and loud, used to build tension in scenes where the aforementioned actors are more than capable to do without, pushes me away. It picks up when we get to the second half(less music, less bickering) but there is still too much angst and drama concerning Jobs personal life which we only see glimpses of. To Boyle's credit, a biography movie, is not easy to pull off. At least for me, Fassbender singlehandedly saves this movie by quite accurately portraying the darker sides of Job's personality."

","I saw the original Steve Jobs movie with Ashton Kutcher, which in my opinion, served as a better outline for his career with Apple.

","""Helming Universal's award season vehicle is Danny Boyle of Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire, and 127 Hours fame. Though keen cinephiles will appreciate the evolving of 16 to 35mm to digital filming over the picture's 14-year time span, the Director's distinctive touch is only subtly apparent via compressing news feed, a failed NASA launch superimposed onto a corridor, and a cheeky use of mirrors to spice up the walk and talk. Otherwise, Sorkin's anchored script cogently restrains the ocular energy of Trainspotting's potently reflective narration and Slumdog's proletariat dash. When the duo does click, however, the result is one of the year's most memorable scenes. During a revealing confrontation between Jobs and Sculley, Sorkin triumphantly reunites with Newsroom star (Daniels) in an intricate dance from their optimistic meeting at an intimately fashioned restaurant, to the board's fateful oust of Jobs to the backdrop of a torrential downpour, to their currently escalating feud moments prior to the launch of Next, Jobs' first individual venture. Rarely referencing one another, the college of scenes is logically pieced together to paint a developing portrait of their almost father-son relationship—highlighted by the warmth timber interior of the restaurant, the dark blue of the midnight rain, and the stark purity of the backstage storage room.""<br/><br/>FULL REVIEW HERE: wp.me/p5Iwnx-4K"
"matthewssilverhammer","8","3","6","30 October 2015"," Every bit as flawed and brilliant as the man himself
","According to the most recent of several Apple-founder biopics, Steve Jobs the man (Fassbender) was a delusional, self-absorbed pioneer with a God-complex to end all god-complexes. He was a less-than-fun dude, to say the least, who changed the helped world. I was hyper-aware that the thoughts I was taking on his faulty and fruitful life were being noted on a device that he created, one that 40 years ago would've taken up a large conference room and now fits in my pocket. These huge revelations have become his legacybut should they have? Fassbender, Boyle and writer Sorkin, each among the best at their jobs, propose that Steve's professional successes may have been the cause of his personal flaws. The plot is a screen writing construction; set during three different product launches and the minutes that lead up to them, Jobs (barely) tries to balance his two children, the more important his current product. The entire film is Sorkin's patented ""walking-and-talking"" trademark, yet never drags even at its 2+ hours length. Director Boyle, while relatively restrained, finds plenty of appropriate moments to display his skill for visual pop. However, the main cinematic thrills all come from the dialogue, as if the words are explosions in an action movie. Some people criticize Sorkin (Social Network, ""West Wing"") because his dialogue doesn't feel natural, the rapacious repartee undercut by over-explanation, and moments standing out as feeling ""written"". However, I usually just find myself wishing my friends and I spoke the way he writes. Add in line-deliverers like Fassbender, Winslet, Rogen, Daniels, and Stuhlbarg, Jobs end result is a hypnotic and highly entertaining capsule of a man at the center of the computer generation."
"tristanbunn","9","3","6","30 October 2015"," Fassbender, Boyle, and Sorkin deliver big!
","I think it's important to mention that this movie is not a biopic. The film takes place behind the scenes of three different product launches and therefore is set up beautifully as a three act film. The direction of this movie is fantastic and is one of Danny Boyle's best in years. He decided to shoot the first act in 16mm, the second in 35mm, and the third digitally so the film looks better and better as you flow through time. Boyle does a great job of not making himself too noticeable as a director and lets the performances and script shine through his direction.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender delivers an outstanding performance and I genuinely think he is Oscar worthy here. He absolutely disappears into this character and makes you forget that you're watching an actor. The entire cast is truly magnificent though. Seth Rogen probably gives the best performance of his career alongside Jeff Daniels and Kate Winslet who round out the excellent supporting cast.<br/><br/>This is a dialogue driven movie. The whole movie is conversations, so I can see a lot of people thinking it's boring, but I didn't feel that way at all. Aaron Sorkin's script is amazing and keeps you locked to the screen with the brilliant dialogue and flow of the story which is elevated by Boyle's direction. Sorkin has continuously proved he's one of the best writers in the business and this script is no different.<br/><br/>Literally the only problem I have with this film is my lack of emotional investment in the characters. I think this comes from the film being a three act product launch instead of a biopic. Due to this method, you don't really get to know these characters as much as I would've liked to (with the exception of Jobs). With that being said, you do see excellent character arcs and progression in their lives, but I could've had a bigger emotional pull to them. However, I don't think that could have been fixed unless this was a biopic which I didn't want it to be. To me, this is a very minor flaw in an otherwise flawless film.<br/><br/>I give Steve Jobs 9/10 or an A."
"ThomasDrufke","9","3","6","25 October 2015"," Think Different
","There's something to be said for a film without special effects, big set pieces, or action scenes, and still is captivating from beginning to end. Steve Jobs is one of the most important figures in our generation, if not the most. While I'm typing this review there's a commercial for the new IPhone 6S, the man's imprint is everywhere at all times. But to me he's always been a bit of a mystery. Everything from his relationship with his supposed daughter to the broken friendship and partnership between him and Wozniak has fascinated me. Although this film may not tell the whole story, it tells one hell of one. With the best screenplay of 2015 and tremendous performances all around, Steve Jobs is one of the best films of the year. <br/><br/>With an incredible end product, it's hard to remember all the troubles this film had behind the scenes. With the shuffling of directors, lead actors, and even studios, for awhile it seemed unlikely this film was ever going to get made. Foe what it's worth, I would have loved to see what Christian Bale would have done with Jobs, but Fassbender proved to be a strong choice. He doesn't look much like Jobs at all, but he seemed to capture his mannerisms and his presence for this rendition of jobs. Credit should also be given to the terrific ensemble cast. Kate Winslet held the film together as much as her character did her Jobs himself. Seth Rogen, who wouldn't normally associate himself with dramatic roles, gives a Jonah Hill in Moneyball like performance. I don't know if it will get him an Oscar nomination, but I think he may deserve one. Someone who may actually get one is Jeff Daniels, who plays John Sculley. Both him and Rogen have demanding roles and scenes several times throughout the film, and they always rise to the occasion.<br/><br/>But I think the hero of this film is the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin. The film is set up as 3 acts each right before an unveiling of one of Jobs' products. It's a structure that hasn't really been done before, but also proves to be very effective. It's jarring and even understandably annoying the first time they go to black as Jobs walks out on stage, but the material behind the stage is so interesting that you get used to it. The run-time is a brisk 120 minutes, but I could have watched 150 if they would have shown the presentations. Though we don't get a look into his products on the stage, we have YouTube for that, we do get a new understanding of the man behind the products and it couldn't have been more fascinating. It's worth mentioning Danny Boyle's great work behind the camera as well, although I'm having a hard time dividing the credit between him and the brilliant screenplay of Sorkin. For nothing else, this film should be seen because of its sharp and intelligent dialogue and Oscar worthy performances.<br/><br/>+Fassbender brings it<br/><br/>+And so does everyone else in the cast<br/><br/>+Give Sorkin the Oscar now<br/><br/>+Boyle handles the structure well<br/><br/>-Cut off some intriguing moments<br/><br/>9.3/10"
"lois-lane33","4","13","43","10 October 2015"," Hardly the stuff big dramatic movies are made of.
","I think it cannot be said that Steve Jobs was classifiable as a heroic figure given the plethora of unpleasant things that have sprouted out of the internet which probably couldn't exist in its present form without the existence of the MAC computer. A device SJ developed but in many people opinions-a device that was never finished. The one I'm using now is a newer one that has a keyboard that makes a fair bit of noise when you type on it-making someone using it in the same room as someone watching TV a problem-it will seriously mess with someones ability to focus on a TV show with its assorted racket of clicks. To me that defines a irritating design rather than a successful design. Additionally many people are now discovering that the big online retailers like amazon & ebay hold accessible but not erasable summary files of their purchases that go back years-which is where buying becomes something a little different. That SJ maybe didn't intend for things to be quite that way is a little like saying because Tommy didn't mean to burn down the building playing with matches he isn't responsible for anything. In this way I think the movie misses the point of Steve Jobs. I think he essentially just wanted to make affordable computers for everyone and ended up doing lots of other things....Nevermind that something that costs over 2000.00 dollars cannot categorically ever be called 'for everyone.' Saying its like the Volkswagen Beetle is a moot point because if you buy a MAC you still need a car. Making well know actor Michael Fassbinder-""the worlds only perfect man"" the face of Steve Jobs doesn't change that the old expression of ""computer error""-the catchword of the 1970's era -still applies today-the only difference being the mistakes are now bigger and they cost more. Like this movie-it probably cost a bundle to make but I think it is essentially an empty gesture: as in the computers someone uses are like the clothes they wear or the car they drive-its just facets of their lives-and not the most important things about them. Imagine making a film about the life of Henry Ford-he was unquestionably an automobile pioneer but is that really film drama material? I don't think so. Its film documentary material only. This should have been a serious documentary so that pros and cos could be aired out instead its a press kit for some new electronic doodad from Apple-that you paid to see. Plus there is the fact that computers like the MAC bother a significant permeate of peoples eyes who don't suffer from eye problems under normal daylight. I think that is a significant issue that has been completely ignored by Apple and all the other computer companies in their rush to get something in the market place in order to cash in on peoples need for personal computers. 'Nuff said."
"Kmark1293","8","5","13","21 October 2015"," A must-see for anyone that cares about movies
","Steve Jobs is the latest biopic on the late CEO of Apple which stars Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels, and is directed by the great Danny Boyle. After going through production hell with various setbacks and dropouts, we finally get to see the final product, which I went into for the amount of talented people on board with the film. Fortunately, I found Steve Jobs to be one of the best that 2015 has to offer so far.<br/><br/>First of all, the script is sharp, witty, fast-paced, and engaging, as to be expected from an acclaimed writer like Aaron Sorkin. Even though his writing can get a bit pretentious at times, his style manages to flow very nicely with the material given to Sorkin. If you're the type of film buff that loves a dialogue-heavy movie, than this is definitely your cup of tea. However, if you're not used to Sorkin's writing then you'll might get overwhelmed with all the snappy dialogue coming at you. And rather than resorting to rushing all the major events in a major character's life like most biopics, the film ends focusing on 3 presentations within the career of Jobs which creates a different feel to the film. All in all, Aaron Sorkin has crafted a brilliant script and is bound to receive various nominations for best screenplay.<br/><br/>Now lets talk about the performances and boy there is really something to talk about here. Despite Michael Fassbender not looking exactly like the Apple CEO, his still manages to bring in a sense of relentless pride and egocentric energy to his title character. Plus, he even manages to bring in some humanity into an eccentric douche such as Steve Jobs. Kate Winslet does a great job as Joanna Hoffman and there were times where her performance almost got me choked up. Its seriously that good. Plus, I found it very refreshing to see Seth Rogen in a more toned down dramatic role rather than resorting to his wisecrack stoner persona. Then you add in another solid performance from Jeff Daniels as John Sculley and you got yourself on of the best ensemble casts of this year.<br/><br/>In terms of camera-work, the choice to use different shots for each of the 3 acts turned out to be quite the brilliant decision. This ends up showing the progression of the technology when jumping through the 3 time periods where the film is taking place. The way the scenes are edited ends up piecing the film seamlessly and the score being played throughout the film adds in another layer to the overall feel and tone of Steve Jobs.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, Danny Boyle's take on the man behind the biggest company in the world does not disappoint. With a fantastic script, wonderful performances, and solid technical work, Steve Jobs is definitely a must-see film for anyone who cares about movies."
"Quietb-1","7","6","17","10 October 2015"," Plenty of sharp dialogue.
","Aron Sorkin writes great dialogue. Here it is too much of a good thing. There are an abundance of walk and talks, stand around and talks, and flashbacks that are all dialogue driven scenes. The last scene, the most powerful in the movie had no dialogue. Take note.<br/><br/>At one point even Steve Jobs says it is like five minutes before every major product unveil, everyone goes out and gets drunk so they can tell him exactly what they think of him.<br/><br/>Excellent performances that will be considered in award season. It is written so that every supporting character has a consider me speech. The wide screen cinematography looks like it was shot on a iPhone. There was a excellent use of music.<br/><br/>The movie didn't go into the life and death issues, perhaps there is a part two. No need to see it on the big screen, it will play well and talky on a home platform."

"Troy_Campbell","10","3","7","5 February 2016"," Invigorating and engrossing.
","Considering last month featured The Revenant, The Hateful Eight and Spotlight, this quasi-biographical picture has snuck up out of nowhere to claim my first five-star rating of 2016. It shouldn't necessarily come as a surprise when you take into account the talent involved. From Aaron Sorkin penning the script, to Danny Boyle helming and Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet starring, the standing of cast and crew is firmly at genius level. Already bagging himself a Golden Globe, Sorkin's screenplay is as whippy, quippy and engaging as his very best work; his dialogue as clever as ever but with the snark and pretension dialled down in order to explore the psyche and emotional drive of a very complex human being. With each act following Jobs backstage before pivotal tech launches – Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and finally the iMac in 1998 – it seems on paper that Boyle doesn't have much to do except point his camera and let his all-star cast go to work. Yet much like Fincher was the perfect director to bring Sorkin's story of Zuckerberg to life, so too is Boyle ideal to flesh out this dramatically complicated tale on screen, employing all manner of techniques to build tension, plumb emotional depths and create a truly immersive experience. If it wasn't Leo's year, Fassbender would surely be frontrunner for the Oscar, delivering a powerhouse portrayal of a man whose towering brilliance was matched only by his enormous ego and ultra-difficult personality. If Jobs is the brains and attitude of the film then Joanna Hoffman – his long-time assistant both in profession and in life – is its beating heart. And in the capable hands of Winslet, Hoffman is a fiercely intelligent confidante that proves the saying that behind every great man is an even greater woman. Steve Jobs is an invigorating and engrossing peek inside the life of a unique and controversial figure in the tech industry, and already rates as one of 2016's greatest movies."

","Steve Jobs is the 2015 biopic that follows the co-founder of Apple backstage before the launches of the Macitosh in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998. The film is directed by Danny Boyle, and the screenplay is written by Aaron Sorkin. Fueled by the films' masterful performances and witty script, Steve Jobs delivers a powerful and emotional look at the man who changed the face of technology forever in one of the best films of 2015.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs focuses on three different technology launches, and because of that, you get to see Jobs during three very different stages of his professional and personal life. These three sequences show Jobs preparing for each of the three launches but also shows his interactions with his daughter, Steve Wozniak, the CEO of Apple and his marketing director. Each of these particular sequences are treated as three interconnected short films. Each sequence has its own setup, and eventual climax and conclusion. This structure is unordinary, but I found it to be very fitting considering the sides of Job's life the film focused on.<br/><br/>Each of these three sections primarily involved Steve Jobs walking and talking with various people. In nearly every other film this would considered a huge negative. However, Steve Jobs' screenwriter Aaron Sorkin is one of the best at his craft, and every single line of dialogue he writes is sharp, witty and powerful. While the film does have its fair share of memorable and quotable lines, it also maintains a strong consistency from start to finish. None of the characters feel like movie characters; they all feel like their real-life counterparts, which is a huge credit to Sorkin. You can go ahead and pencil in Sorkin for a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>What is great dialogue without great direction and great performances? Luckily, Steve Jobs succeeds in all three of these categories. Danny Boyle is one of best directors working today, and while his style of filmmaking in Steve Jobs isn't flashy, he directs his actors and actresses in a way that allows them to shine.<br/><br/>Okay, enough beating around the bush. What about Jobs himself? Michael Fassbender is absolutely outstanding as Steve Jobs. His on screen presence, his line delivery and his subtle tendencies are all a perfect match. He is an absolute lock for a Best Leading Actor Oscar Nomination. The film features some great supporting performances, as well. Kate Winslet is great as his marketing director, Joanna Hoffman, and Seth Rogan shows some range with his performance as the other co- founder of Apple, Steve Wozniak. I will always remember Jeff Daniels as Harry Dunne, but he's fantastic as John Sculley. Since this film does have so many great performances, I think some people may over look Michael Stuhlbarg's strong performance as Macitosh designer, Andy Hertzfeld (running out of good adjectives to describe performances). I firmly believe Steve Jobs collectively has the best performances out of all the movies I've seen in 2015.<br/><br/>While the film highlights Steve Jobs' life, it doesn't idolize him; it shows him for who he was, for better or for worse. The film's (3rd) climax is very powerful; there wasn't a dry eye in the entire theater by the time the credits began to roll.<br/><br/>I'm all aboard the Steve Jobs bandwagon. The film's quality in script, performances and direction are all first class. Steve Jobs lives up to the Apple legend's name and deserves a standing ovation.<br/><br/>Check out my other reviews over at www.watsonmoviereviews.com or follow me on twitter @alexwatson1994 to talk movies"
"DoubleOscar","9","3","7","4 November 2015"," A Job Well Done
","Being disappointed with the 2013 Jobs film starring Ashton Kutcher, I was actually excited for this take on the Apple founder to see if they could finally get it right. That and the powerhouse team consisting of Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, director Danny Boyle, and writer Aaron Sorkin. I am happy to report that Steve Jobs has finally been done justice with this gem.<br/><br/>To begin, although he doesn't completely look the part, Michael Fassbender completely embodies Steve Jobs. He makes the icon simultaneously unlikable and likable by bringing a sense of humanity to the character. The story follows Jobs backstage at three of the biggest product launches of his career. The audience is brought along for as they are shown all of the inner workings and struggles that go along behind the scene while the people wait in the auditorium for the product. <br/><br/>To continue, the entire supporting cast does a magnificent job at portraying the people surrounding Jobs. Kate Winslet is fantastic, although her accent does go all over the place sometimes. Seth Rogen and Jeff Daniels are the most compelling and give equally powerful performances. The script from Aaron Sorkin is masterful though, admittedly, at times overwhelming. The dialog is so compelling, but the audience can get lost at times in the computer jargon that goes back and forth between the characters. Furthermore, director Danny Boyle was very subtle in his approach and allowed the actors to shine more than him. <br/><br/>The emotional core of this movie is grounded in the relationship of Jobs and his daughter Lisa. In all three acts of the story, Lisa plays a huge role in the development in Jobs's character. In the beginning, he is in complete denial, but by the end he is more welcoming and wants her to be by his side.<br/><br/>Overall, Steve Jobs is a brilliant representation of Walter Isaacson's book, skillfully converting the text to the big screen. Everyone involved in the production brings their A game and should be gifted with plenty of nominations come awards season. <br/><br/>""It's not binary, you can be decent and gifted at the same time."""
"HotToastyRag","5","2","4","6 June 2019"," Seems like you're watching a play
","If you're looking for a flattering depiction of Steve Jobs, this 2015 biopic isn't it. Starring Michael Fassbender, and costarring Kate Winslet as his overworked assistant and Seth Rogen as his former business partner, the film paints Jobs out to be demanding, distant, unreasonable, and cruel. I watched this movie with my dad, and he'd just finished reading Walter Isaacson's biography on which the film was based. He said there were obvious parallels from the written words to the film, so those of you who read that biography might be interested in renting the movie.<br/><br/>To me, the film reeked of the theater. If I hadn't watched it with my dad, I could have sworn Aaron Sorkin's screenplay had been based off of a play rather than a book. It's separated into three sections, or acts, and it could have easily been performed on a stage. Each act takes place backstage before an event, and as Steve prepares to make his big speech, the same few people come into his life with the same problems. It has a very symbolic feeling, showing that as time passes, a man can outwardly progress and yet stay stuck within himself.<br/><br/>There's an overwhelming dizzying effect by director Danny Boyle to try and show audiences Jobs's mindset, as well as a purposely irritating score written by Daniel Pemberton, to remind audiences that when he least needs chaos, chaos finds him. I didn't end up enjoying this movie, because the protagonist was so unlikable and the theater-esque setting felt a little pretentious, but Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet's performances were worth watching. I barely recognized Kate, and Michael's constant energy was as exhausting as it needed to be.<br/><br/>DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. During almost the entire movie, there are either ancillary images floating in the background or a fluid camera movement that will make you very sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!"""

","Hoped the movie was about the entire life, ended up ""just"" seeing 3 moments in his life, before some critical moments none the less. Yet, have the feeling that a good dramatic movie about his entire life has yet to be made (see Jobs (2013) which was OK, but not epic). Steve Jobs (2015) was lacking some feeling of ""I was there"", Michael Fassbender is a good/excellent actor, but I didn't got the feeling I was watching Steve Jobs himself, and that's too bad. The other actors, like Woz, played by Seth Rogen, were much more like the real person. Joanna Hoffman I had to look up on Google, did look like how Kate Winslet looked in the movie, but I didn't recognize the real person in it. Jeff Daniels as John Sculley I recognized as the same kind of person as in Jobs (2013), which I think was a good thing. First being the alliance with Steve, then switching towards the board/company. Good acting there."
"drqshadow-reviews","9","2","4","28 January 2016"," Sharp, Smart and Stinging, This Film Pulls No Punches
","Aaron Sorkin gives the Apple co-founder some close scrutiny in this unflattering portrait, cleverly framed around three key product launches. Caught at his most over-stressed, Jobs often comes off as both the smartest man in the room and the most heartless, a difficult mix that's expertly managed by Michael Fassbender in the leading role. Fassbender doesn't even remotely look the part, but his ruthless conviction and forceful, melting gaze make the act easy to swallow despite that. It's also true of Seth Rogen, actually, who seems a bizarre choice to play celebrated engineer Steve Wozniak, but pulls it off against all odds in several tastefully limited appearances. This isn't the typical biopic, spanning a figure's entire life and weaving it all into one grand, epic journey with a happy ending. Instead, it's a concise, efficient peek through the window at three turning points in the man's history: his biggest gamble (Macintosh), his greatest spin (NeXT) and his ultimate redemption (iMac). The products get their moments to shine, as does Jobs's infamous penchant for micro-management, but the real story focuses on his relationship with an unwanted, unaccepted daughter and the betrayal of an adoptive pseudo-father. There's warmth in the script, and in its focal figure, but also a terrible, heartbreaking coldness on both fronts that seems painfully real. It may not be the whole story (several heavy moments are fabricated in the name of plot) but it's enough to convey a better understanding of its subject as a human being, warts and all. A terrific effort, moving and entertaining the whole way through, that merits watching whether you love the ubiquitous brand or loathe it."

","Hollywood has given us five major motion pictures about an asteroid that is going to hit the Earth. Much like that plot line, I strongly believe Earth has enough movies about the life and times of Steve Jobs. Whether he be a madman or a genius, the audience has enough stories on Steve Jobs in their library. Aaron Sorkin brings us another well written ""West Wing"" quality script where people are walking and talking while taking and walking. Much like the movie depicts a sold out audience time and time again to applaud everything and anything that is and was Steve Jobs, movie's like this have a devoted fan base of fanatics that will wait in line for hours for an ""App"" that they do not need. Steve Jobs is at times entertaining and informative while also being empty and pertinacious. Time and time again the audience is asking the question, Why? Even with a good back story of why Jobs left Apple and why Jobs was the way he was, the movie leaves us asking time and time again, Why Why Why? Why do we need another Steve Jobs movie? Why are we showcasing the life and the man: Steve Jobs? And why do we not give Steve Wozniak the credit that he deserves?"
"valen060","8","2","4","29 October 2015"," A Glimpse Into An Enigmatic Visionary
","Academy Award-winning director Danny Boyle's (Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours) follow up that looks into the late, iconic Apple co-founder's struggles onstage and offstage was certainly a difficult one to comprehend. The moment the first scene began, I was filled with curiosity on what exactly was Jobs' problem when balancing both his prodigious work and personal life simultaneously.<br/><br/>The plot centers around Jobs' introduction of the Apple I computer back in 1984 to the debut of the iMac in 1998. But during that era - in spite of his vision of allowing the public to experience computer usage in a different way - his personal troubles behind-the-scenes involving family made him a complicated man with his several imperfections.<br/><br/>I'm aware of the 2013 take that starred Ashton Kutcher, but comparing that movie to this one, I'd say this version glimpses into the more darker, complex personality that is Steve Jobs rather than inconclusive facts and juvenile scriptwriting. Michael Fassbender's portrayal is physically uncanny as the leading man. Whereas his costar Seth Rogen as fellow co-founder and friend Steve Wozniak seems to have grasped his inner dramatic side (quite a shift from his comedic work) by showing how much Wozniak went through to help make his and Jobs' vision a reality. Although the film is all about Steve Jobs and his varying tribulations to success, I'd say the real hero is his daughter Lisa. She's basically his rock. As years progressed and she had gotten older, Lisa knew deep down that even if he repeatedly denied in public that she is not his daughter (when a DNA test said otherwise), he cares about her even when he doesn't openly show it. I'm sure award nominations will certainly not be ruled out based on these actors' performance. <br/><br/>The movie does tend to slow down in some parts revolving around Jobs' ousting from Apple and eventual reinstated status. With the help of ""Social Network"" screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, both he and Danny Boyle's combined efforts into creating a movie that displays a near-spiteful, yet astute glimpse into how much Jobs sacrificed and changed the outlook of many computer users. Whether you're an Apple follower or not, this isn't a movie that overglorifies Jobs as a profound intellectual that can do no wrong and overshadows all his rivals easy. No. Instead he is more of an enigmatic visionary with a complicated, yet conscientious life whose legacy reverberates in the company millions around the world have come to know. All great visionaries struggled to get where they needed to be and Steve Jobs is no exception."

","A cradle to grave story about a man as iconic as Steve Jobs would be 3 hours of life highlights laboriously in the style of connecting dots to show who Steve Jobs was. Rather than creating such a complex narrative, this film focuses on three very public events in Steve Jobs life and showing behind the stage at these pubic events key elements of his private life. <br/><br/>Enough has already been said about the public events, his product launches, but in these events we see Steve Jobs' determination toward success and his failings. Steve Jobs is seen as a jerk at times but also a man who in the end will do right by his daughter.<br/><br/>As the credits were rolling, I reflected on the film and looked at my sons IPOD. At that moment, I realized what the film was doing, showing how Jobs had design vision for technology but it took awhile for technology to catch up to his vision, while contrasting his public and private life with a stage curtain. <br/><br/>This film clearly shows a cross section of Steve Jobs and lets the viewer come to an understanding of the man whose products we all know."

It felt like it wanted to be something that it was not. Where A Few Good Men had its 'You can't handle the truth,' and The Social Network had it's 'you pathetic d-bag,' moment, Steve Jobs felt like it too wanted that big showdown but we didn't get it.

","Unlike The Social Network, Steve Jobs isn't a feature length thriller. It's more like a concept album. Through three separate Apple launches within the span of 15 years, Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin explore the financial, cultural and spiritual evolution of Steve Jobs, the man behind the Mac. But a flawed man he was. Through mostly dialogue alone, Jobs is pried by his associates, superiors and loved ones. At times, Jobs feels soulless, and constantly focused on the finished product he is selling at the moment. Each section differs in which camera equipment it was filmed on. Act 1 is 16mm film, Act 2 is 35mm film, and Act 3 is digital. Not a bad touch by Boyle. This, stylistically, properly departs from Fincher's gloomy world of Facebook. Sorkin's screenplay is as richly developed as ever, but at times, emotionally empty. Sorkin loves the smell of his own farts. It shows. Every character kind of sounds the same. In any event, Steve Jobs, the movie, has a specific mission. To tell the story of one man, his extraordinary product, and his extraordinary mind using as little visuals as possible. Luckily, it succeeds."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","3 June 2019"," Riveting storytelling and performances
","Simplistically, a biopic is telling the story of the protagonist. But the accent can be either on the ""story"" or on the ""telling"". The former could end up being quite bland. The latter is a challenge, to showcase the moviemakers' virtuosity in storytelling. This is something that ""Steve Jobs"" accomplishes.<br/><br/>The protagonist is likely a celebrity, to one degree or another. When it is Steve Jobs, nothing more needs to be said. What is crucial is the actor who portrays the celebrity. People who would look first towards physical resemblance miss the most important thing: acting ability. A good example is Frank Langella playing Richard Nixon in ""Frost/Nixon"" (2008). There is little physical resemblance and yet Langella on the screen becomes Nixon, by the sheer force of superb acting. The same can be said about Michael Fassbender playing Steve Jobs.<br/><br/>The movie is in 3 acts, and the mise-en-scene often conveys the impression of a stage play. The 3 acts are set respectively in 1984, 1988 and 1998, anchoring on the launching of three products, the Macintosh, the NeXT and the iMac, in that order. You will note that none of the Apple products that have today become part of our daily life had yet been developed then. However, at least one is alluded to in the movie, near the end. I'll come back to that.<br/><br/>As mentioned, this is a ""telling"" sort of biopic. One way to discuss it is in terms of Jobs's relationship with people who have an important role in his life: Joanne Hoffman (Kate Winslet), Lisa Brennan (3 young actresses at age 5, 9 and 19), John Scully (Jeff Daniels), Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen). But first, how Jobs sees himself is reflected in a few interesting quotes. ""Like Caesar, I'm surrounded by enemies"" he says. He has a deep suspicion for people: ""the very nature of people is something to overcome"". And he is an A-hole of an egotist. Using a musical analogy, he asserts ""Musicians play their instruments. I play the orchestra"".<br/><br/>The most important of the four people I mentioned, in terms of this movie and the acting, is Joanne Hoffman. Fassbender and Winslet got Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. In one scene Joanna intimates to Jobs that she has won, 3 years in a row, an award created among peers: best employee standing up against Jobs. She refers to herself as his ""work wife"". In the beginning of the final act, when things are going well and they are in a jovial mood, he asks ""Why haven't we slept together?"" ""We are not in love"" she replies without batting an eyelash. As his public relations advisor, she is all but indispensable. However, their relationship does not pertain only to work, but embodies a love that transcends romantic love. The best example is at the start of this scene 3, when the business side of things are going well. Here is a Joanne that is the most furious we have yet seen, demanding that Jobs amend his relationship with daughter Lisa, ""or I'll quit"". With heart-breaking earnest, she tells him ""When you are a father, that's the best part of you"". Winslet won Golden Globe and BAFTA, and should have been awarded an Oscar.<br/><br/>This movie puts a great deal of emphasis on the relationship between Jobs and Lisa, a daughter he refuses to acknowledge. Through the three acts, Lisa at 5, 9 and 19 are played by three distinguished young actresses providing such uncanny consistency that for a second, you suspect that like in the movie ""Boyhood"", the role is played by the same person, shot through a timespan of over a decade! I will not go into details. Suffices to say that Jobs gets somewhat reprieved at the very end, in the most heartwarming moment this movie offers when he and Lisa exchange gazes between stage front and backstage at the side. Oh yes, referring to the ""future"" Apple product mentioned earlier, the last words (for the movie) Jobs says to Lisa is triggered by her listening to a Walkman. He promises his daughter ""I'll put 1000 song in your pocket"" referring to, of course, the iPod, a brain-child at the moment.<br/><br/>The most dramatic and captivating scenes are with Scully, placed in Act 2. It is a series of rapid cuttings back-and-forth between the time frames of Act 1 and Act 2, depicting the evolvement of the relationship between these two men. They also sharply focus on Jobs getting fired, and his subsequent revenge by banishing Scully, both from Apple. Another heart-warming scene is seeing the two of them, somewhat mellowed, reconciling in Act 3.<br/><br/>The one person closest to Jobs would have to be the other Steve, Wozniak, or ""Woz"", who started out with Jobs in a garage as the pair embarking on a journey to change the world. But the saddest thing, at least according to this movie, is their deteriorating relationship. One recurring motif in all three Acts is Woz asking Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II Team to the audience, which is flatly refused, again and again. In the final confrontation, in exasperation, Woz askes ""Why do you want people to dislike you?"" Jobs claims that he is indifferent. Then comes the final revelation: deep down, they never had respect for each other. Woz's parting words make an immortal quote ""You can be decent and gifted at the same time. It's not binary"". (I have taken the liberty to reverse the order of the sentences for better effect)."

","Genius is often a tough thing to define; and for the person that is frequently defined as a genius, it can lead to a feeling of invincibility, a feeling that you know more than anyone else, inherent insecurity, and indifference. A fair amount of that was very true of Steve Jobs, the co-founder, with Steve Wozniak, in 1976 of Apple, which over the ensuing two decades of turmoil and enormous growth became one of the biggest technological corporations on the planet. His death from a pancreatic tumor in the fall of 2011 at the shockingly early age of 56 led to a stream of films, documentary and feature alike. One of those was the 2015 opus STEVE JOBS.<br/><br/>Based on Walter Isaacson's hugely successful biography that included a lot of interviews with the man, STEVE JOBS stars Michael Fassbender as the ""resident genius"" of the explosive Silicon Valley technological scene of the 1980s always busy dreaming up new technological marvels, and parsing off blame on others when things don't go according to his own version of Hoyle. Indeed, his reactions to his former colleagues, like Wozniak (Seth Rogan) and former Pepsi chairman John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), and even his own marketing executive Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), are ones of almost intolerable cruelty, including Daniels having axed Fassbender from Apple, and Rogan pointing out in graphic detail how much he, and not Fassbender, created the computers and operating systems that made Apple a technological giant in the first place. And then flesh-and-blood reality in the form of a former girlfriend of his (Katherine Waterston) and her daughter, intrude; and he Fassbender is eventually forced to confront the failures in his rise to the top that were caused by his cold obsession with ""changing the world"".<br/><br/>Fassbender does not have an easy job in his portrayal of Jobs, largely because he has to get into the skin of the techno-genius, and that skin is clearly crawling with ego. Truth be told, Fassbender's portrayal really comes across as one of the bigger egomaniacal bastards seen on screen in recent times. This probably has a lot with the real Jobs having been so candid about himself with Isaacson in the book prior to his passing, though such a character, in what passes for today's Hollywood, can be seen as rather repellent. But that would seem to be what Steve Jobs himself was often like, especially during those times that the film focuses on, the roll-outs of new products of Jobs' own skewed creative mind that happened in 1984, 1988, and 1998. It also doesn't hurt that the direction of Danny Boyle (SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE; 28 DAYS LATER; 127 HOURS), and the screenplay adaptation of Isaacson's book by Aaron Sorkin (A FEW GOOD MEN; THE SOCIAL NETWORK) have both a marvelous technological sheen and a scathingly sardonic edge (peppered with a fair amount of profane bits of dialogue) to it.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, despite (or maybe because of) the realistic, if frequently unsympathetic, portrayal of Jobs by Fassbender, along with Winslet's, Daniels', and Rogan's performances, the film is a very direct look at how being a ""genius"" with an outsized ego to match can do funny things to those who have both. STEVE JOBS, as such, is worthy of a '9' rating from me."

","Steve Jobs was a fascinating, though complex, individual, so having a film based on him was always going to peek interest. Then there is the talent involved in 'Steve Jobs', director Danny Boyle who has made some very good films, one of today's most talented script-writers Aaron Sorkin and Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet as the leads.<br/><br/>Found 'Steve Jobs' to be a good and interesting film, albeit not one that will appeal to all viewers as can be seen from the polarising reviews. There is a lot to like here, and the good points are actually excellent. At the same time, considering the involvement of such fine talent and subject matter, 'Steve Jobs' also had potential to be, and perhaps should have been, more than good, great even. There are also a few issues here, and fairly sizeable ones, though there is much more good than there is bad.<br/><br/>There could have been more complexity to Jobs himself, difficult to do for a perfectionist who was very difficult to work with. Can definitely understand the criticism of 'Steve Jobs' being a pretty one-dimensional portrait of the man that magnifies his flaws. For something featuring heavily, his personal/family life could have been better explored and delved into more, there is heart with the relationship between Steve and Lisa but the final fifteen minutes or so to me came over as contrived rather than emotional and although Katherine Waterston does a good job her role is underwritten.<br/><br/>At times, the film is jumpy and also could have shown more of the launches themselves and showed how they were received rather than being told afterwards, for a film so heavily reliant on the backstage/behind the scenes aspects. Actually really liked the script on the most part, it is though talk-heavy and with scenes having a lot to take in there are instances where it's not easy keeping up. Also didn't buy Jobs/Scully's final scene together, which went against what was seen with their acrimonious confrontations before. <br/><br/>However, 'Steve Jobs' is very well made visually. It's unfussy but never cheap, actually it is very slick. It may feel like a filmed play, which is also down to the structure of the film, but for me it wasn't a problem. Boyle directs in a restrained fashion, while showing plenty of engagement with his material. The music is both low-key and lively when used.<br/><br/>While not perfect, Sorkin's script is one of the high points of 'Steve Jobs'. It's thought-provoking, intriguing smart and rapid-fire, with plenty of wit, intensity and snappy put-downs. The story, following an unconventional yet fascinating three act structure dealing with three different launches that Jobs revolutionised, goes at an energetic pace and is kept afloat by the intensity of the characters (especially Jobs and Joanna). Things move quickly and there is plenty to be interested by, one just can't help feeling that some aspects could have been delved into more. Jobs and Joanna have plenty of intensity in their chemistry, while Woz's final scene and the big scenes between Jobs and Scully are especially powerful. <br/><br/>Other than Sorkin's script, 'Steve Jobs' best asset is the acting. Fassbender may not look like Steve Jobs but he is nonetheless terrific and is an incredibly compelling presence. Winslet's performance is tense and deeply felt. Michael Stuhlbarg steals scenes in his not large screen time, while Seth Rogan demonstrates why he should do more dramatic roles and films and Jeff Daniels has not been this good in quite some time. Waterston does well with limited screen time and her role underwritten.<br/><br/>Concluding, good film but not a great one. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","Every techie knows who Steve Jobs was. That is, they know that he founded Apple Inc., revolutionizing computers. But most people probably don't know Steve Jobs the man. Danny Boyle's Academy Award-nominated 2015 movie ""Steve Jobs"" is based on Walter Isaacson's biography of the Apple founder. Jobs had authorized the bio, but Isaacson's condition was to get the final say (in that he didn't give the most flattering image of Jobs). It got published right after Jobs's death on 2011.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on three major events in Jobs's life: the release of the Macintosh in 1984, the launch of NeXT in 1988, and the unveiling of the iMac in 1998. Accompanying each of these is the issue of Jobs's refusal to provide for an old flame who claims that he's the father of her daughter. In these scenes, he comes across as kind of a nasty person. It was ironic that I watched all this on a MacBook Air.<br/><br/>The movie emphasizes these events and relationships; there's no depiction of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak coming up with the idea for the computer in their garage. I guess that the point is that every icon is bound to have a less-than-venerable side. But seriously, are you gonna get people in this day and age to give up their iPhones just because Steve Jobs wasn't the nicest guy?<br/><br/>It was through watching this movie that I learned about most of the other people who were involved in launching the products. I'd heard of Jobs and Wozniak. Joanna Hoffman, Andy Hertzfeld, John Sculley and Andrea Cunningham were new to me. Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Michael Stuhlbarg and Jeff Daniels turned in outstanding performances, as expected. It was surprising to see Seth Rogen in a serious role for a change, since we're used to seeing him play stoners who talk about bodily functions. But he gives it his all here.<br/><br/>In the end, I recommend the movie."

","In 1 word, fan-tas-tic!<br/><br/>Forget the consensus biopic of 2013. Boyle's film here, whose only (relative) defect is to be released after, is infinitely superior at all levels.<br/><br/>Cinephiles, comedians known or not, go see it. This is a real movie of comedians. It takes place in 3 acts, each shot on 3 different media: 16 mm film, 35 mm film and digital. During the shooting, before each act the actors repeated for 1 week and then turned the act, stop, repetition and so on. Filmed in 3 different theaters, still indoors, it revolves around the two main characters (Jobs and its marketing director). Splendid work (we will say ""as usual"") of Fassbender and Winslet, and all the supporting roles.<br/><br/>The film keeps us in suspense for 2 hours at the sole strength of the actors and the quality of the dialogues fairly dense. A little technical but not that much.
It's not a movie about the Mac. It shows (in each of the acts) Jobs before each product launch, you know those technological masses that made Apple-addicts vibrate. Each act ends when Jobs enters the scene.<br/><br/>It shows the story of the successes and failures of Jobs, its conflicts with its employees, its partners (Wozniak) and its bosses. And especially paternity with his daughter, he refuses to recognize at first. It is in this relationship that is difficult to weave which emerges the humanity of the film, which could have been a long blah-blah without soul. Failure avoided brilliantly because the narration is dynamic. Included in the text but without the context of the adventure Apple.
The music is discreet, it is limited to regular and repetitive layers, never too present. It is only there to insinuate a subtle but effective tension when it is necessary. The characters are complex, human, diverse. Nothing manichean here.<br/><br/>Facing film, we can draw parallels with ""The Social Network"" David Fincher, the story of Facebook. Shiny film too but here Boyle offers us more sensitivity to humans, to what he lives. The relationship between Jobs and her daughter is as touching as possible, because it develops despite the rough personality of Jobs, and flourishes only at the end, without artifice, without violins, without big accolades, without tears. And it's all the more moving."

Seth Rogen is surprisingly decent as Steve Wozniak while the great Michael Stuhlbarg steals all of his scenes as usual.

","Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, in reference to this movie, was once quoted as saying, ""(Steve Jobs) is not a photograph it's a painting.""<br/><br/>After reading the book and then recently seeing the movie, I would agree. Walter Isaacson's authorized biography of Steve Jobs is a favorite of mine and the movie is pretty good, but no where near as detailed.<br/><br/>The movie is not really 'Steve Jobs'; he was so much more than the asshole portrayed in the movie. Yes, true (as Isaacson's bluntly objective book confirms) Jobs was a massive jerk; a sometimes mean, vicious, sarcastic person who believed he was God's gift to computers, and a ruthless businessman. He wasn't a code-writer or an engineer. He was a visionary. He knew what we wanted before we wanted it. His mind was years ahead of technology. Kurt Cobain changed the face of music; Steve Jobs changed the face of computing forever (I don't own a single iThing) and he did it his way.<br/><br/>Writer Sorkin did an excellent job adapting Isaacson's book for the screen, doing it in three acts that coincide with three of Jobs' biggest business 'accomplishments': The introduction of the Macintosh (1984), NeXT (1988), and the iMac (1998). (The NeXT was a disaster. A $13,000 - in today's dollars - perfectly square useless brick. But, fun-fact, the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, used a NeXTcube to run the world's first webserver!). There was so much to Jobs' life and so many more people in his life detailed in the book, that it must have been a difficult adaptation for Sorkin. However, the point was taken – Jobs was a brilliant, albeit flawed person.<br/><br/>It's fun to watch the movie, and it's faced-paced so you won't be looking for the 'NeXT' scene button. Take it for what it is, a subjective portrait."

","A well done movie, but frankly one that often left me cold. So focused on rapid-fire smart-tongued speech. Sure, every character in this movie is able to lash others with their sharp tongues, but the rapid-fire dialogue gets tiresome fairly fast. Does everything really have to be such a battle of wits, personalities, and egos? Seems to be so in this film. Also, I must say that Jobs came off as profoundly narcissistic, so much more so than I had anticipated. Not sure if this is true to the actual Steve Jobs, but if so, I must say I lost a lot of respect for Steve Jobs after having seen this movie. Surprises me that he is hero-worshiped by so many, if indeed he has such a selfish and narrow-minded personality. <br/><br/>That said, the acting by Michael Fassbender is excellent, as is Kate Winslet as his assistant, and just a generally fine job by the whole cast.

"rogerdarlington","Null","0","0","2 July 2017"," Much the better of the bio-pics on Jobs
","In the past few years, there have been two major movies about the life of tech entrepreneur Steve Jobs, the creative genius behind Apple.<br/><br/>The first in 2013 was called simply ""Jobs"" and starred Ashton Kutcher in the title role. The second in 2015 went for the title ""Steve Jobs"" and Michael Fassbender filled the eponymous role. Both films have at their emotional core the expulsion of Jobs from Apple in 1985 and his triumphant return in 1996, but the later work builds the narrative around three pressured product launches - the Apple Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998- with flash-backs to seminal moments in the man's turbulent career.<br/><br/>The second film is much the better one. It has a more accomplished director in the British Danny Boyle rather than Joshua Michael Stern. It has a much more creative writer in Aaron Sorlkin - the man behind ""The West Wing"" and the writer of ""The Social Network"" - compared to first-timer Matt Whitely. And the Irish Fassbender is just so much more impressive than Kutcher.<br/><br/>Indeed there are some excellent performances in support roles too, including Seth Rogen (as Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak), Jeff Daniels (as Apple chairman John Sculley), and Michael Stuhlbarg (as senior team member Andy Hertzfeld). Another thespian strength of the movie is that it has a pivotal role for a woman, the wonderful Kate Winslet, as long-suffering - but loyal yet defiant - marketing executive Joanna Hoffman, plus a support role for Katherine Watertown as the mother of Jobs' daughter whom he originally treated appallingly.<br/><br/>Like ""The Social Network"", ""Steve Jobs"" is a wordy work but Sorkin is a master craftsman of dialogue with fast and furious exchanges that communicate so much about events and character. And the actors revel in the kinetic energy of the script and direction with Fassbender rarely off the screen in one bruising encounter after another. Fassbender may not look as similar to Jobs as Kutcher but he totally occupies the role and makes the movie."

","I was hooked almost as soon as the movie began, and I followed the flow of Sorkin's dialogue all the way till the end. The movie could have easily lasted for an hour more and follow Jobs through the rest of his career. But I'm sure it would be harder to keep it thematically together, at least the parts of the story that they chose to focus on.<br/><br/>I've never been all that interested in Jobs, but I was completely captivated by Fassbender's performance here. But to me, he did not feel much like Steve Jobs, but rather a (brilliant) character that uses the narrative of the historical person ""Jobs"" as means to unfold himself. In a way, it was odd to see this movie made about people who are mostly alive (or recently deceased) because it feels more like characters in a play than it does any sort of biopic. (But as I'm writing this, I'm wondering if this is something I truly felt, or only expected to feel due to the reputation of the movie and Sorkin's writing.) But even though I found the movie enjoyable from beginning to end, there's not many big moments in it that'll stick with me. I can imagine it being very rewatchable, but not all that memorable."

","Less a biopic of the computing pioneer and more of a series of snapshots, this Aaron Sorkin scripted film focuses on the title character's anxieties in the minutes leading up to new product launches at three stages of his life. This is an interesting move by Sorkin and director Danny Boyle as we only get to see Jobs when at his most vulnerable, but the effectiveness is debatable. The film is flooded with flashbacks to provide exposition and fill in key details and tension inevitably dissipates with so much cutting back and forth. Sorkin also struggles to get under the title character's skin to reveal a human being. In the title role, Michael Fassbender is cold and distant throughout, proudly stating ""I'm indifferent to whether they dislike me"" and cynically commenting that people always ""find a reason to sue me"" when asked about contacting his birth father. On this note, the film tries to use the fact that Jobs was adopted as a possible reason for him being so callous but to little effect. His relationship with his estranged daughter is the only really element that humanises him, and even that never quite clicks with their bonding lost in the jumps in time between the three acts. And yet, there remains a lot to like about how the film captures his enthusiasm and showmanship, ruing the fact that movies like '2001' made the public fear computers and practising his product launches time and time again. Daniel Pemberton's pulsating music score is pitch perfect too and it is easy to see why Kate Winslet garnered awards attention, even if her authentic Polish accent sometimes slips."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","0","1 February 2017"," Ambitious concept is creative and compelling, but ""Steve Jobs"" misses on emotion
","One of most successful and enigmatic tech minds and CEOs of the 20th century, the prospect of a film that could tear down the façade and present a compelling examination of Steve Jobs is pretty thrilling. Assigning that story to the only household name in screen writing, Aaron Sorkin, with Oscar winner Danny Boyle directing and one of today's most revered actors (Michael Fassbender) in the title role, the prospects turned out to be even juicier.<br/><br/>Yet ""Steve Jobs,"" despite its dynamite acting and dramatic intensity, gets noticeably hampered by its own ambition. Sorkin endeavors to paint a complete and complex portrait of Jobs in a tidy three-act structure, with each act taking place in the hours and minutes leading up to three huge product launches: the Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988 and the iMac in 1998. On the precipice of believing he's about to change the world with each announcement, we come to know Jobs through a series of backstage interactions with colleagues past and present and also his daughter and her mother (Katherine Waterston).<br/><br/>This setup creates certain confines of time and space that serve as an echo chamber for the acting and Sorkin's dialogue, including his infamous ""walk and talks"" from his ""West Wing"" days. Although this amplifies the script, which is obviously positioned as the centerpiece of the film, it doesn't give Boyle any room to work with and begs the question of whether ""Steve Jobs"" would be better suited as a play.<br/><br/>Plays need great dialogue, great acting and great ideas and ""Steve Jobs"" has all of it. Even the supporting characters with whom Jobs interacts in each act conveniently remain the same: marketing chief and closest confidant Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), old friend and Apple co-creator Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen), chairman of the board John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), Apple computer scientist Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) and Jobs' daughter, Lisa Brennan, played by three different actors. Each has different points of tension with Jobs and seem to have a a habit of confronting him in these moments.<br/><br/>These numerous interactions provide insight into Jobs' disastrous interpersonal skills, especially the moments with his daughter in which he seems incapable of wearing the mantle of parent. Fassbender is particularly good at portraying Jobs' apparent lack of empathy especially toward Lisa, whom he views as a market test for how the next generation will use or want to use personal technology.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Sorkin aims to depict Jobs as a visionary with a firm grasp on how people think, and how he let nothing stand in the way of forward momentum. One of the best examples comes early on when Jobs is insistent that the Mac says ""hello"" during the launch demonstration. His complicated friendship with Woz also brings this to the forefront; Woz insists that Steve give kudos to the team that developed the Apple II, which put them all on the map in 1977, yet Steve refuses him on principle. His never-look-back mentality was part of his genius and his flaws.<br/><br/>These verbal back-and-forths can venture into esoteric territory. We don't see or experience any of the development or creative process behind any of these three products, just talking heads dropping expository clues as they argue. This kind of limits the scope with which we can observe Jobs. We can only really watch how he treats people, because he's almost exclusively talking. We don't get to see him in action, which would more effectively stretch the palette of colors available to Fassbender and Boyle to paint Jobs' persona. This particularly harms the emotional appeal of the character and therefore the film. It's intellectually satisfying, but lacking in pathos. Such is Sorkin's bane at times.<br/><br/>""Steve Jobs"" has the magnetism that a biopic of Steve Jobs should possess. That largely comes from skilled actors wielding Sorkin's sharp dialogue, which despite having its own drawbacks is fitting of a film about an entrepreneur who always found a way to rise, like cream, to the top. The film, on the other hand, doesn't quite rise to the top of creative biopics, though certainly not for lack of trying.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"brando647","8","0","0","22 November 2016"," The Strength of STEVE JOBS is in the Performances
","STEVE JOBS is one of two biographical films released following the Apple visionary's untimely death. I skipped the one with Ashton Kutcher in the lead role because I knew I could never take Kutcher seriously in such a role and because I'd heard rumor of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin taking a swing at it. Here is the final product of Sorkin and director Danny Boyle and, unlike the Kutcher film, this one managed to snag a couple Academy Award nominations for some of the cast. Anyone familiar with Sorkin's writing should have a pretty good idea of what to expect in this, namely snappy dialogue and a lot of conversations on the go. Sure enough, STEVE JOBS is the ultimate ""walk and talk"" movie, putting all other ""walk and talk"" movies to shame. Rather than following the life of Jobs from childhood and going through the major milestones in his life, Sorkin decided to try something a little cleverer. STEVE JOBS is divided into three sections, each one set in a different time period before the launch announcement of one of Jobs' products: 1984 (the Macintosh), 1988 (the NeXT), and 1998 (the iMac). In each segment, we watch as relationships develop and crumble with key figures in Jobs' life including co-creator of Apple computers Steve Wozniak, former CEO of Apple John Sculley, and Jobs' own daughter Lisa. STEVE JOBS gives an interesting (and occasionally unflattering) glimpse into the mind of a man often hailed as a modern genius and marketing legend.<br/><br/>This strange use of the three act structure was one of the film's more intriguing elements. I love that Sorkin decided against the usual biopic format because I don't know if it would've been as interesting. He forgoes chronological accuracy and takes a little creative license with the details, but rather he created a movie that doesn't focus on the events of Jobs' life to bring us into his world. Instead the film focuses on the people in his life. Of course, at the center of the film is Michael Fassbender's winning performance as Steve Jobs. Fassbender is a fantastic actor and he really disappears into the role. As Jobs, Fassbender is at times sympathetic and relatable while at other times his ambitions and unrelenting nature bring out his megalomaniacal side. I love that STEVE JOBS doesn't pull any punches in its portrayal of the man. So soon after the man's passing, one might have to worry that a biopic will sugarcoat the details so as to not offend close relatives or be seen as unfairly tainting a man's legacy when he's no longer around to defend himself. But STEVE JOBS plays a perfect balance and falls in line with what I've read of the man. Sorkin based his screenplay on the information from the biography written by Walter Isaacson and the movie was interesting enough that I might have to check it out. The man knew how to play the game; it'd be nice to get the full story.<br/><br/>As powerful as Fassbender's performance is, I expect it from him. The man has never let me down. What blew my mind was the surprisingly strong performance from Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak. Wozniak's role in the film seems to be bringing to light Jobs' inability to share the spotlight, even if it means shunning those that helped get him there. Wozniak appears at each of the three product launches in the film in hopes that Jobs will throw out an acknowledgment for the team who helped make the Apple II a success, but Jobs insists that it's the past and he's took busy looking to the future. Plus the Apple II's success made it difficult for Jobs to keep the company's focus on his new Macintosh when it didn't perform to expectations in the mid-80s. Rogen kills it in a scene where he goes toe-to-toe with Fassbender in the 1998 segment when the exchange gets heated. As unaccustomed as I am to Rogen in dramatic roles, this was an eye-opener and a strong show on his part. Jeff Daniels also gets a juicy role in the film as John Sculley, the man who's career tanks when he becomes ""the man who fired Steve Jobs"" from Apple. He has a nice arc where he goes from a supportive, optimistic partner in 1984 to a defeated man in 1998 who just wants to set the record straight. Kate Winslet acts as our guide through the walking and talking as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing exec. She is Jobs' right-hand woman throughout the film and essentially leads us from conversation to conversation while doubling as the voice of reason.<br/><br/>STEVE JOBS is a clever twist on the biopic genre. It gets all the relevant information in without following the same old structure. It does become a little problematic when you see through the film to the structure and, during a quiet or less interesting moment, find yourself running through your head which confrontations have occurred and which still need to before the movie can move on to the next segment (e.g. ""Let's see, we've already done Wozniack, Sculley, and Andy Hertzfeldugh, we still have Lisa and the reporter to get through""). There are a few slow moments where the momentum stutters but generally, for a movie that is 100% about human interactions and, well, walking and talking, STEVE JOBS has an undeniable energy that keeps it exciting to watch."

","In some ways Steve Jobs (written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle) is an odd film. There's nothing at all wrong with it at all, and a great deal that is right. But Apple fanboys and Mac nerds drooling for a big fat biopic will be very disappointed.<br/><br/>Yes, you get a few biographical details, although very little that wasn't known, but this is a different animal entirely and most certainly not the kind of 'wasn't he just a fabulous genius' hagiography so many will have hoped for. (On that score, in fact, I'm puzzled that there have so far been so few calls from the 'Mac community' to have Jobs sanctified: in many eyes he already is St Steve, and all the Vatican would be doing would simply be to confirm the fact.)<br/><br/>On the other hand the film produced by Sorkin and Boyle is odd in that it need not have been about Jobs at all: in essence their film is a study of a single-minded obsessive, his need for control and his relationship with his illegitimate daughter, and that obsessive could pretty much have been anyone, not least an utterly fictional character. From what we think we know about Jobs, he would seem to fit the bill, but he wasn't at all a necessary part of the film.<br/><br/>Even to call it a film is debatable: essentially Sorkin and Boyle's Steve Jobs is a three-act play and would work well on stage in the hands of a talented theatre director (and quite possibly will at some point). It is also something of an ensemble piece, the ensemble being the very excellent Michael Fassbinder and the equally excellent Kate Winslet (ironically both British), with great support from Seth Rogen (in a serious role, unusually for him, but one he carries off well), Jeff Daniels, Michael Stuhlbarg and Katherine Waterson as the needy, resentful discarded girlfriend.<br/><br/>As I say, it would work equally well on stage, especially as the film is dialogue driven. What is particularly impressive is that the themes of Jobs difficulties coming to terms with his adoption as a baby and consequent need for total control, his fractured relationship with his daughter, his complicated relationship with the man who became the CEO of Apple and something of a father figure and the quirk that a man at times unbearably unpleasant inspired something close to love in so many who worked with him are treated with a delicacy sadly rare in a Hollywood film.<br/><br/>My one complaint on that score is the schmaltzy scene right at the end of the film, though I understand that an element of pure schmaltz is pretty much de rigeur in all American-made films. It's what the public craves. Well, this viewer doesn't and could have done without it. But I'm glad to say coming at the end of the film and lasting but a few seconds it did nothing to spoil a very good film indeed. See it if you have the chance, but bear in mind my warning that it might be the very opposite of what you expect."

Mr. Sorkin beats you over the head with the message. The worst part about it was the cliché ""becoming a better father"" subplot. By all accounts, the real Steve Jobs was described by those closest to him, such as Steve Wosniak, as being a selfish jerk.

This movie showed none of that. I've followed Apple Computer a little bit through the years, but this movie must assume you are an ""Applephile""....it assumes you know what each struggle Jobs was going through at the time.

","Two years after Joshua Michael Stern's Jobs, Aaron Sorkin would aim to rectify the story of the man who made apple by penning Steve Jobs. The film suffered a disastrous pre production which saw top talent such as David Fincher, Christen Bale and Leonardo DiCaprio turn down the film and the film was even dropped by the Sony conglomerate. Fortunately for Aaron Sorkin, his adaptation would see the light of day as director Danny Boyle and actor Michael Fassbender would eventually confirm and stick with the project through to completion... Only for it to flop in the box office. On the bright side though Aaron Sorkin got a Golden Globe for all his troubles.<br/><br/>Speaking of Aaron Sorkin's Golden Globe win, the films script is interesting as it focuses on the Steve's personal failures than his career achievements. Highly selective and dialogue heavy, this character study set during three Steve Jobs tech presentations aims to present the unlikable genius that didn't seem to do much. As Steve says ""I play the orchestra"", but from what this film suggests, that quote simply means he uses people for personal gain. Ironically this film achieves very little (on the personal side), despite it being about a extremely successful man. By the film's close Steve doesn't make amends with many of the people in his life and in real life he remained estranged from his daughter. This aims to mirror what really happened and what Steve really did but it leaves you with no sense of closure when the credits roll.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, Michael Fassbender takes on the role of Steve Jobs in this biopic. Fassbender is arrogant and extremely unlikable as jobs and so does a particularly good job worthy of the Oscar nomination he received. Fassbender is surrounded by an equally good ensemble cast; Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels and Seth Rogan are terrific in this film. Seth Rogan I found most impressive, shifting away from comedy to do drama successfully in his portrayal of Steve Wozniak. The collective collaboration of the cast play a huge part in the enjoyment and quality of the film and should be applauded.<br/><br/>The only real critique of this film is that it could have focused on and done more with the character its about. The film is extremely selective and misses out some major moments in Steve Jobs' life; such as the birth of Apple, his involvement with pixar, the iPod and his cancer. I do on the other hand understand that the film would want to be more than a by-the-numbers biopic and of course there is the Ashton Kutcher Jobs that the film makers of this film would not want to repeat, so i'll give this film the benefit of the doubt in that respect as well as this being a character study of the man and not a walk-through of his achievements that everybody probably knows about.<br/><br/>Overall Steve Jobs is a well acted, well written film that focuses on the man and not the legend that is Stev Jobs. Although the film could arguably done and/or covered more of Jobs' life the film doesn't fall into by-the numbers biopic by doing so. The first Jobs film was a failure with critics and the second, a failure at the box office. Lets hope this film gains success on other platforms... For Aaron Sorkins sake at least."

Where his friends and associates turned on him, he refused to turn on himself. The movie gave enough balance in terms of his personal life, his weaknesses, and most importantly, his undying determination to change the world through personal computers. Steve Jobs was a people's man, in reality. He wanted the power of computers put into the hands of every living person on Earth, and that passion carried his dream into reality and helped him to overcome all the road blocks put in his way.

","Steve Jobs is the 2015 biography of the life of Steve Jobs, told specifically through each of the three major product launches which he led. <br/><br/>I went into this movie expecting to be bored. I thought there'd be a lot of technical jargon that I wouldn't understand, but it actually handled itself very well. The whole movie takes place in the minutes before each reveal of his new computer system, so there isn't a lot of jargon at all. I actually understood this movie really well. Not only that, but the fact that the movie managed to pull off this presentation is pretty great. It's an interesting idea and it actually worked. <br/><br/>As expected, the performances are all great. Michael Fassbender continues to be great, and everyone else is good too, even the child actors. The characters themselves were developed pretty well, despite the audience only seeing small parts of their life here and there. Each character was consistent throughout basically the whole movie, and thanks to the writing none of them seemed particularly fake. Not only that, but the characters managed to update the audience on what had happened between each launch without blatantly stating or explaining it. It knew the audience wasn't full of idiots (hopefully), and thus didn't treat us as such<br/><br/>My only problem with the movie is a handful of parts from the last act. Some of the sudden confessions and such from the characters were a little forced or out of place, but they didn't take away from the movie too much. <br/><br/>At times it could be a little slow, but again it wasn't a big deal. <br/><br/>Overall Steve Jobs is a really solid movie. It's the Steve Jobs movie that we didn't really need or want again (considering we got one in 2013) but got and enjoyed anyways. Other than a handful of minor flaws, this is definitely one of the better films of the year. In the end I would recommend this movie."

","Steve Jobs is one of the most interesting people of our time, a true visionary though a troubled and troubling man. Given the amount of movies featuring him, you'd think we'd have every aspect of his covered, but the unfortunate reality is that most movies seem to miss the mark. Steve Jobs (2015) comes closest, letting us see a glimpse of a complicated life, yet it's nonetheless pretty weak as a movie. Its pace is unnecessarily and inelegantly frantic, its scenes erratic and anxiety-inducing, and ultimately, we only get to see the notorious Jobs rather than Jobs as a human being. Though the man certainly had faults, some bigger than others, he was interesting and multi-faceted, neither of which are qualities that I can ascribe to this movie's presentation. Much is omitted, much is pompous, and there is little to no substance all in all."

","I found this on DVD from my local library. Good movie, does not follow a typical ""biographical sketch"" technique.<br/><br/>This is the latest in a series of movies about Steve Jobs, in the years following his death in 2011 at the age of 56. During the 1980s when he and his company, Apple, were making their big splash in the computer industry I was working for a large company and using PCs so only had a peripheral idea of what was going on. I know a lot more about Jobs now than I did when he was alive.<br/><br/>The filmmaker is Danny Boyle and in the extras explains that he set out to make a movie quite different from the prior movies on Steve Jobs and his life. The script writer interviewed many people still alive who knew Jobs and identified what he termed five significant conflicts in Job's life and incorporated those in the story. One of them was his daughter Lisa, he had denied paternity for many years before finally reconciling with her. As depicted in this movie she went to Harvard and now has a successful career in journalism.<br/><br/>So overall the story here is factual but told in a non-linear manner. Most or all the events really took place, in some form, but didn't necessarily take place the way they are depicted here. <br/><br/>Michael Fassbender is super good as Steve Jobs and Kate Winslet is super good as his long-time confidant Joanna Hoffman. It is stated that she so wanted the role she had herself made up to look just like the real person as her form of auditioning for the role. I don't always like Seth Rogen but here he is good as Steve Wozniak. And of course old reliable s Jeff Daniels is good as John Sculley.<br/><br/>Good movie of a very complex character, Steve Jobs."

Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) is his ever-present right-hand man. John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) is his father figure and CEO of Apple. Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) is always vying for acknowledgment of the Apple II. Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston) is the mother of Jobs' daughter Lisa.

Seth Rogen is surprisingly good in a non-comedic role. Waterston is terrific as the baby mama. There is no denying that Aaron Sorkin knows how to write unique dialog but it feels non-real. I believe that this would be one of the best movies of the year if it's about Stephen Jet. Sorkin has written some of the greatest work around like West Wing, Newsroom, and others. They all have a superior to reality feel. This is altered realism but I think everybody is more interested in the actual truth. There are some great scenes. There are big scenes.

"CloeLP","5","0","0","27 April 2016"," So much for so little of a great story
","Steve Jobs, directed by Danny Boyle is a based on the true story of the famous Steve Jobs and his career in the computer world, mainly with Apple. This movie is filmed as a biopic focuses on Jobs's work and mostly on his many presentations to the audience. In the same time we can see and learn about personal issues with his family and difficulties in team work. The plot isn't really surprising and that interesting except for the ""personal side"" of him that I wasn't really expecting. <br/><br/>At the beginning it's rather confusing, we don't understand everything right away, it's kind of quick. However I liked how the steps between the start of his career until he gets fired to his return were depicted. <br/><br/>The cast was great with good acting skills but to me it wasn't the most exiting film I have ever seen; at the end it gets a bit boring and there's a lack of originality or at least not enough change, it's always the same, like a hoop that turn again and again if we stick to to ""work part"". The story line is easy to follow, it represents Steve Jobs's personality that we have heard about and adding the personal life to the movie was a great idea that makes us able to see also the man behind the leader of a big company even if I think it might have been romanced a bit to attract people.<br/><br/>It has a pretty good ending with him fixing things with his daughter and the possible success of his last invention. Another positive point is that it shows Jobs as someone who doesn't give up. He follows his ideas, tries and finally finds what he was looking for, it brings faith to people, that even if you fail, if you keep failing, one day eventually it'll work out the way you want it to. I also liked the flashbacks that explain how and why a scene is what it is, like the one that speaks about how he got fired and his argument with one of Apple's executives. <br/><br/>In my opinion that was an interesting movie, with some touching scenes but unfortunately not as great as I expected it to be. I would recommend it for some scenes however I would nos see it again because I found it boring at the end. It is not a must-see and I would personally wait until it comes out on TV."

","I watched ""Steve Jobs"" because I studied the former CEO of Apple in English class. I must admit I didn't know much about him, so this review won't take historical accuracy into account. I liked it because of its original structure: the 30-40 minutes before the presentation to the public of a new product. It seems unrealistic to see a man arguing with family, friends, co-workers and employees in order to get things the exact way he wants them to be and getting more or less what he expects in the 30 minutes before the show starts. But after giving it a thought, this way of showing Job's attitude and moments of crisis is original and prevents the movie from being boring. I had a good time but I still don't understand how Jobs got so successful despite his temper. Actors were great, though I think Jobs's daughter when she's 19 could've sounded more natural. A last frustration was to never get to see the presentation of one of the products, but I believe there is archive on the Internet. So, if you are curious about technology or Apple, and even if you don't care, I think watching this movie is a good way to learn (approximatively) how Steve Jobs and Apple became what they've become."

","'Steve Jobs' is a movie I saw at the cinema with my English class during the British Screen Festival in Nîmes. We saw this movie because we are studying the themes 'Heroes and Icons' and 'The Idea of Progress' and we dealt with Steve Jobs. I think Steve Jobs was a hero in the computer world, because of what he did with Apple, combining engineering and art, which was, and still is, loved by many people in the whole world. We saw that in the movie, when we see Steve Jobs who wants to create new projects, and very different ones, original concepts. In the movie, we can see Steve Jobs at the beginning of his career, and then, we see him before the important events of his life in Apple. It always takes place before he presents a new concept, or a new computer line, which is the 'work part'. But there is also a 'personal life' part, when we see his daughter, Lisa, who is growing up all along the film. We always see Steve Jobs getting ready just before the 'show', but we never see him on stage, we don't really understand why his projects keep failing all the time, which I think, was a bit disappointing. I expected the movie to be really boring and too long for that kind of film. I think it is better than what I expected, but still, I did not enjoy it that much. I think it would have been more relevant to watch this movie if I was having economic courses, but still, it is a film that shows why Steve Jobs is a hero in his world and a person who fits in the idea of progress. I recommend this movie if you are a fan of Steve Jobs, or interested in the Apple World, because the film makes a parallel between Steve Jobs's personal life and his place in the Apple Company."

","It's time again for a biography and another film about the IT- entrepreneur Steve Jobs, who passed away just a few years ago. He was portrayed on film in 2013 by Ashton Kutcher in Jobs, but now the famous screenwriter Aaron Sorkin picked up the story again and wrote a new script. Danny Boyle directed it and Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet stars as lead and supporting role. Steve Jobs is not really about the entrepreneurs' whole life, but divided in only three parts. Each part is about the game behind the curtains prior to different product releases. We follow him in these three moments through two decades, just the half hour before he steps up onto the stage.<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin is known for writing very talkative scripts, like The Social Network or Moneyball. Steve Jobs is no exception. Fassbender fights and argues with Winslet, his family, his employees and his bosses. Every episode is suppose to represent and portray Jobs through different stages in his life, his distance to his family, his employees and his conflicts with the company Apple itself. Here is where the true strength of the film lies. There is much to take away from the dialogues and we can tell a lot just by listening and of course enjoying first rate acting.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs still becomes a bit boring. After you've understood the episode parts and how the story is told mostly through dialogue and not images, nothing more really happens. Steve Jobs is in the film and was probably in real life, a very difficult man to understand. I don't really feel like I know more about him than I did before watching the film. His problematic character and the constant driving forces are there but what really motivates him. There are a few parts that explains this, like his childhood, adoption and so on, but I still think that more scenes from several years of his life, would have been more interesting. Steve Jobs is still a smart film and I like the idea, bit to get more than three out of five, something else would have been needed.<br/><br/>David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"

","Of the stuff I've read about Steve Jobs, about his unrelenting drive and disagreeable personality, it seems to be captured here with a fair amount of realism. Michael Fassbender infuses the character of Jobs with a caustic persona that doesn't let up much throughout the story. The few glimpses we get into Jobs' past help the viewer understand some of what drives the passionate genius in one area of his life, and how it undermined his relationships with those closest to him on a personal level. The supporting players here were exceptional, and it was interesting to see how Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) and John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) managed to go toe to toe with the abusive computer pioneer, in many cases proving after the fact that they were right and he was wrong. Even with what little I know from a technology standpoint, it always seemed intuitive to me that Apple products were limited by their closed architecture, so I have a hard time understanding why the real Jobs refused to acknowledge it. The picture reveals some of the bullheaded stubbornness the man had along those lines, and if one can get past the personal flaws of the title character, the story offers a compelling portrait of a principled man who might have engaged in a bit of humanity along the way."

But, as much as I hate to admit this - fashion is a huge part of human history. And his impact thereupon - is indeed likely to run very deep. <br/><br/>I don't know how accurate this portrait is. I honestly don't. But it is certainly a well-painted one. Depicting a man with just the stuff needed - to said impact. At a particular moment in time.

It plays out behind the scenes of three product launches – the original Apple Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT Computer four years later and the final act of the iMac launch in 1998. Steve Jobs shares many themes with Sorkin's The Social Network as both are stories of technological geeks who find success and become lost in their creation.<br/><br/>The dialogue is witty and memorable as Jobs paints himself to be the composer. When estranged Apple co-founder Wozniak asks him to define what he actually does as he can't write code or put together circuit-boards, Fassbender delivers a thought-provoking line: ""The musicians play their instruments, I play the orchestra."" Though Kate Winslet's accent starts globe-trotting at times and the amount of walking-and-talking in scenes can start to get under the skin a little, the film is eminently enjoyable.

Küchler Cast: Michael Fassbender Kate Winslet Seth Rogen Jeff Daniels Katherine Waterston Michael Stuhlbarg Perla Haney-Jardine Ripley Sobo John Ortiz Sarah Snook Makenzie Moss Adam Shapiro Rating: 7.7/10<br/><br/>A biography feature of the late Steve Jobs, scripted by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle, stretching from 1984 to 1998 and opens with Arthur C. Clarke's prescient interview about a personal computer in 1974, the film cleverly encapsulates the stories into three acts, all set minutes before the product launches: in 1984, Apple Macintosh, in 1988, NeXT computer and in 1998, iMac. Such a decision constructively shuns from the common default of the biographic genre, that is, ponderously chronicling a tedious running account of (significant) events in our protagonist's live, moreover, Boyle leavens the conflicts (both professional and personal) between Jobs (Fassbender) and various characters with Sorkin's trenchant script, creates riveting theatrics which more inclines to BIRDMAN (2014) than THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010).<br/><br/>Admirably, this is no Jobs' cheap hagiography, in the first act, the very first scene, his tremendous self-will has started to get under one's skin, it is understandable gifted people might have conceit in themselves, but his egoistic and sadistic treatment towards Andy Hertzfeld (Stuhlbarg), a member of his team, is unapologetically offensive. Things are not helped by his flagrant denial of fatherhood to Lisa (played by Moss, Sobo and Haney-Jardine in 3 different ages), his daughter from ex-girlfriend Chrisann (Waterston), but what is the reason behind that denial? We might never know, although the film's depiction of Chrisann as a brazen money-exacting might betray something information, at any rate, she is not a role-model mother either.<br/><br/>Other staples in the three acts (apart from Andy, Chrisann and Lisa) are Steve Wozniak (Rogen), his peer, co-founder of Apple, who is relentlessly begging Jobs to acknowledge the work of Apple II team in the launch, which Jobs unswervingly refuses simply because he is the conductor, and Apple II team is not a qualified musician in his orchestra deserves the plaudits, as plain as that. The next one is his boss John Sculley (Daniels), CEO of Apple from 1983 to 1993, whose rapport with Jobs experiences a big turning point after Jobs being fired from Apple after the unsuccessful launch of Macintosh, he is a quasi-father figure to Jobs, with specific flashbacks to emphasise the key incidents between them; and last but not the least, Joanna Hoffman (Winslet), the marketing executive who stands by him all along the journey, she is the only one who can put some senses into Jobs' opinionated head, and becomes the bridge between him and others (friends or foes).<br/><br/>Engaging and sparkling rival show between Fassbender and his co-stars, without relying too much on physical resemblance, Fassbender's Jobs is a flawed entrepreneur, a genius hampered by his personality, as he claims, he doesn't care whether to be liked or disliked by people around him, his only aim is to do the right thing, to create revolutionary products in the digital era and in fact he succeeded. Fassbender beautifully instils into his character with this sort of unsympathetic self- regard and skepticism, he taunts religion with his remark about God sending his only son to be sacrificed, yet, in the third act, the warmth of a bonding father-and-daughter cosily rounds up a content ending, blissfully, there is a learning curve for him through these years. There is literally no bones to pick in his immaculate embodiment of such an iconic figure, Steve Jobs is a person after all, when all the hales are evaporated, he is not the man in the machine.<br/><br/>Winslet is gung-ho is her supporting turn, her Joanna completely orbits around Jobs and bespeaks of the purest friendship which a man and a woman can ever achieve, it is a heartening return to the accolades after years of nadir since her controversial Oscar win for THE READER (2008); Rogen and Daniels are also awards-worthy although apart from Fassbender and Winslet, the entire film (particularly Daniel Pemberton's magnificent score and Sorkin's dialogue-laden script) is under the radar of the past awards season after its disastrous box office performance last autumn.<br/><br/>Reality distortion field, a term coined to describe the mixture of Job's personalities, which now has become a symbol of die-hard loyalty for Apple's products, which leads to a more existential question, why on earth we should be interested in Steve Jobs' personal crisis? The far more inspiring and illuminating parts are how he brings Apple company to its unprecedented fruition against all the setbacks and how they develop their groundbreaking OS and alas, as competent as Sorkin and Boyle, these are the blind spots they cannot offer to present, and rarely any biographical movies do."

","Half a decade has passed since Steve Jobs' passing but he's as ubiquitous and significant in our lives than ever: we all have personal computers, we watch 3D animation, we have a stock of 500 songs fitting in our pockets, and we're all used to digital technology whether on tablets or cell-phones. In other words, we all owe to Steve Jobs, and this is why he's regarded as one of the most defining pioneers and modern-day inventors of the last century, in the same vein than Edison, Ford or Disney.<br/><br/>(Granted Bill Gates was more successful, but he's always referred to as the richest man in the planet while Steve Jobs' star shines a little higher) Yet we're perfectly aware that the job wasn't done alone. But like all the best entrepreneurs, Jobs knew how to combine the talents of people who were lacking one thing, but the most crucial one: a vision. Jobs knew how to guide his teams toward one vision. And being a visionary genius is a double-edged sword and is liable to make you overlook the merits of your team workers, and earn you only respect by way of love or admiration.<br/><br/>Jobs' public image was of a revolutionary and inspirational pioneer but in private, lovability wasn't his strong suit and this is what Danny Boyle's biographical film, based on Walter Isaacson's book, is about. As if he took for granted our knowledge of Steve Jobs' accomplishments, Boyle went for a disrupting, but oddly fascinating character study, structured into three acts, each one featuring the launch of one of Jobs' key products : the first mass-produced computer Apple MacIntosh in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, designed for a more business-oriented target and the iMac G3 in 1998, which was adapting the computer industry with the Internet era.<br/><br/>Although the film features a few flashbacks, like the legendary garage starts, or Jobs' firing after the MacIntosh' failure, it really respects the three-act structure, each act ending before the presentations (so much for Aaron Sorkin's expected speeches). Still, why these three products, why the last two anyway? The film features Jobs in the most awkward and risky positions and it focuses on his failures maybe a little more than his successes, which, put with his private problems, doesn't leave much to appreciate in the man. But we follow the film, we try to grasp at least 75% of the dialogs, confident that such a well-acting cast can't lead us to a flop, and eventually, the film rewards our patience with an overwhelming finale.<br/><br/>Still, it was a risky move from Danny Boyle, even more, because one of the last screenplays written by Aaron Sorkin was the Oscar-winning ""Social Network"", and Mark Zuckerberg was a student in his 20's who revolutionized social media and became a billionaire in less than a decade. The appeal of such figures is the inspirational stuff great biopics are made of. The same goes for ""Steve Jobs"" but it's handled differently by Boyle, as the film is more about the man's darker side, and how it made him the man he was. It actually echoes ""The Social Network"" tag-line, showing you can't reach millions of people's lives without making a few enemies, but still, in its own way, the film gets a little depressing at times. Jobs don't have enemies, but it says something when you're not liked by the people who care the most about you, and, when most of the time, you act like a cocky bastard.<br/><br/>The trick is in Michael Fassbender's (Oscar-nominated) performance, he doesn't make Jobs likable, but makes us understand that this likability wasn't exactly the best driver to his success, it's a defense mechanism that actually betrays more vulnerability than strength. The trick is also to have his conscience incarnated by his faithful marketing executive and confidant, Joanna Hoffman, played by Kate Winslet, who never hesitates to openly disapprove his decisions and actions, and you can see in Winslet's nuanced performance (Oscar-nominated as well) the exhaustion of a no-nonsense woman who decided that her life would be dedicated to that arrogant prick because somewhat, that made sense. Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen), co-founder of Apple and John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), former CEO meet Jobs at these launches and vainly lure him into admitting his flaws and faults.<br/><br/>Still, Jobs' stubbornness is a fortress that takes almost two decades to be overcome.<br/><br/>The three-act structure is perfect in the way it allows the characters to evolve through a natural process, called maturation. It also allows some interesting dialogs moments that erupt from the whole computer jargon, like Jobs telling Wozniak that he might not have his engineering talent, but he's like the conductor of a symphony and Wozniak's a musician. Why doesn't he admit the merits of Apple II in his speech? Steve Jobs is turned to the future and can't afford any sentimentality. This sentimentality is conveyed by the core of the film, the issue over his daughter Lisa, to whom Jobs denies the paternity. This is the key to understand Jobs and his rude behavior, as his background didn't make him pleased by himself either, and the films' ending echoes ""The Social Network"" by a little wink to the beginning, when he bonded with little Lisa over the MacPaint.<br/><br/>And this is Jobs' story, a series of endings calling for new beginnings, a man who might have jeopardized his career because he didn't care for honors but maybe found unconscious reasons to improve himself, as if the quest for perfection had to call for some self-destruction. And it's like Boyle was inhabited by Jobs' spirit as he also take too many chances with that three-act format, and the result was a talkative character study that would've been perfect for a play, maybe ""Steve Jobs"" was a little too ambitious for its own good."

","I love Sorkin as a writer, but after screening 'Steve Jobs' last night, I realized what I hate about his lead characters in both 'Jobs' and in 'The Social Network': they're emotionally-stunted fanatics who talk and process more like a robot than an actual human. While I'm sure both Jobs and Zuckerberg share some similarities - being driven to succeed and wanting to see their vision through - you end up not liking the subject throughout the film. By the time Jobs warms up in the last five or six minutes, it's too little too late. I spent most of the film thinking, ""this guy's a jerk - why would I find this entertaining?"" There's nothing to root for.<br/><br/>Aside from an unlikable lead character, I did think Fassbender and Winslet played their roles very well.

","Great performance by Michael Fassbender, decent movie but the movie is all about Fassbender. In a biographical movie where the main character is Steve Jobs, Fassbender plays is role very well, great acting.<br/><br/>The movie itself is not the greatest I have seen but it was very entertaining, showing a little bit of Apple's history and the personality of Steve and his view and role in the development of computers and technology.<br/><br/>Average movie where only Fassbender takes it to another level, without him it would just be another movie about Apple/Jobs, in my humble opinion."

As for the movie I am glad they showed you the man behind the brand without holding off too much on the real him. Was Steve Jobs a genius? Maybe. Was he a great guy? Based on the movie, you could argue that 99% of people who ever came in contact with him actually disliked the guy. Is this a great movie? No. it is not, but it does not really matter since the point for most of us was to discover who Steve Jobs really was. At least, that's the reason I watched it and I got what I wanted.

This movie is, essentially, 3 one-act plays strung together with major players of his life showing up for the events.<br/><br/>It's an interesting concept and lends itself well to the writing style of Sorkin, but the movie just doesn't go anywhere. Jobs is a driven technology visionary with low collaboration and interpersonal skills who remains a driven technology visionary with low collaboration and interpersonal skills.

Kate Winslet, is Oscar nominated for her role (though I don't see it being an Oscar-caliber turn), but the movie belongs to Michael Fassbender who brings the strength, passion and courage of Steve Jobs convictions in EVERY scene that he is in.

"CineMuseFilms","7","0","0","11 February 2016"," An unexpectedly unflattering and melodramatic portrait of a tortured soul
","The biopic film is a sub-genre that focuses on the life story of a significant person and usually aims to immortalise, celebrate, document or, in some cases, demonise them or their achievements. As the creative genius behind one of the most successful enterprises on the planet, the late Steve Jobs stood at the epicentre of some of the greatest technological changes seen in the last century. Yet this film is not about achievements or technology at all. While the narrative is framed by three key product launches that shaped the destiny of Apple Inc., it is an unexpectedly unflattering and melodramatic portrait of a tortured soul. Frequent references to his adoption as a child, his need for a surrogate father, and the denial of his own daughter, makes this a story of a little boy lost who grew up to be a man he did not like.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbinder gives a powerful performance as Jobs and the lack of narrative action is made up for with plenty of flashbacks and fast-paced dialogue, often with several people at once, to create a cacophony of emotional noise to reflect the inner world of Steve Jobs. The portrait is not nice and many will see the film as one to bury Caesar, not to praise him. Fassbinder's ability to portray manic arrogance and genius at the same time makes for compelling viewing. He permits short sharp glimpses of suppressed emotional confusion, even warmth, whenever Jobs is with his daughter Lisa, but this is contrasted by arrogant insensitivity towards everyone else around him.<br/><br/>The whole film is an immersive emotional high-wire act, with Lisa and Apple the two anchors of Jobs' life. The cinematography is part of the message, with many shots of Jobs taken from low angles to make him appear larger than life, a messiah of techno-art and design, a man who not only saw the future but created it. In the final scenes his abrupt and corny conversion into the kind of father who smiles at his daughter rings hollow, but otherwise this is an engaging tale of a flawed human who was both hero and villain to those who knew him best."

"Merang0","8","4","13","17 October 2015"," A brilliant film about an amazing man, but...
","Yes. Steve Jobs the movie is absolutely brilliant with uncanny performances that capture the real people, but likely totally boring to the technically uninclined. The movie lacks any mention at all of Adobe - which revolutionized personal desktop publishing and editing - or Pixar, but it's only a three act slice of unlikely accurate memoirs - albeit conjecture - just moments beforehand three pivotal product launches during a 15 year span after the Macintosh personal computer was introduced. <br/><br/>The film within itself is perhaps an excellent metaphor to the persona of Steve Jobs, and it somewhat builds a classic character that changes - particularly with Job's relationship with his daughter. Yet from a history of Pixar point of view, the movie lacks Jobs true childlike fantasy of emotion to propel mankind into the future - much like the euphoric society in Star Trek. Yes, my understanding from being a Jobs fan over the years, Jobs was a Star Trek fan and the iPhone is just the tip of the iceberg in making the communicator and the view-screen come to life. <br/><br/>If you like good acting - Seth Rogen was a pleasant surprise as Wozniak - and you want some reasonably accurate history of Apple, then you won't be disappointed. Personally, I feel that altering the chronology of events and actual meetings between people that didn't happen is perhaps a disservice to Jobs, his family, and friends. But Jobs has changed my life - as I write this on my beloved iPad - as well as many others. The film as a piece of art representing the man - Steve Jobs - is well done, but some day I would like to see a biopic that shows more of his happy emotions, emotions that we the beneficiaries of the fruits of his labors often feel."
"lam-bui","9","3","9","11 December 2015"," ''Musicians play their instruments, I play the orchestra''
","This is a rare movie that has an unlikable character and an unorthodox structured plot where nothing really happens, but you just can't keep your eyes of the screen. Steve Jobs has an all-star cast, Danny Boyle as director in one of his best films and has Aaron Sorkin with one of his best writing. This is certainly one of this years' best movies.<br/><br/>The movie is about Steve Jobs and his crew and family behind the scenes of 3 major product launches, which will alter the course of Steve Jobs' career. Personally and professionally. On a professional level he interacts with people like his ''work wife'' Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), former Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen). The family business behind the scenes are between him and his daughter (Makenzie Moss, Ripley Sobo, Perla Haney-Jardine) and her mother (Katherine Waterston). The movie is told in three segments and each segment contains the release of another product: The Macintosh computer in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988 and the iMac in 1998. <br/><br/>Can a great man be a good man? Steve Jobs is a movie which has a strong focused direction towards this question without really giving the answer. Steve Jobs is portrayed as narcissistic, stubborn and careless but also stoic, focused and passionate. He doesn't care about how much a person makes (in fact he doesn't care about almost anything or anyone really), but what the person makes. The film studies such a complex character in a 2 hour film while keeping it entertaining with sophisticated, top notch craftsmanship. <br/><br/>Writing unlikable characters in hectic moments of their lives is something Aaron Sorkin excels at. We have seen that he can pull it off in films like The Social Network and Moneyball and in the HBO series The Newsroom. His dialogue is unrealistically fast, witty, smart, and playful but also very satisfying to observe given the right timing and pacing. The writing in this film is typical Sorkin: it gives a lot of insight into the characters while keeping the audience informed about the events that are happening surrounding the characters in a fast pace, without being convoluted or too serious (yes, the laughing muscle will be triggered).<br/><br/>The star is this movie is undoubtedly Michael Fassbender, who gives the character many layers. Reckless and careless when it comes to work ethics but progressively emotional and caring when it comes to family matters. Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels and Seth Rogen add value by being challenging for Michael Fassbender in a dialogue. They are the ones that make Steve Jobs, as a character, stronger and they are the ones that complete this ensemble piece. <br/><br/>Everything the characters say add something to their character or to the story. Some elements however, are forced. Elements that could've had more impact if it was explained earlier or were explained at all. There are characters that are cramped in the story just for character-motivation and exposition purposes. This could've worked if the film was longer or if there was given more attention to that particular element in the story. <br/><br/>All in all, Steve Jobs is a great film with a killer script, world class acting and an interesting perspective on Steve Jobs as a character. Portraying him as a mastermind and a caring father but also as a first class douchebag and a flawed character who is, as he says himself, poorly made. Fortunately, what isn't poorly made is this film. It is one of the best films of this year and it will generate attention come awards season."

","A man has an idea: everyone on the planet can have his or her own personal computer or PC. The PC would be totally interactive and could be taken anywhere; it would be ascetically attractive and be both a toy and and decorative object. Yes, a great idea. In this movie, this man's idea gets buried inside a mountain of techno-babble and interminable griping that obscures the story to the point that it loses its cohesiveness. The story starts in the middle of something and ends in the middle of something. The man withe the idea is, of course, Steve Jobs. He is portrayed by Michael Fassbender whose physical similarity to Jobs is uncanny. His performance is powerful and dominates the movie. Unfortunately the same adjective, powerful, cannot be applied to the movie itself. More apt would be the adjectives choppy and confusing. If one is not already familiar with the story of Steve Jobs, this movie will make no sense. Just a story of two guys at odds with each other over whose should get credit for a computer. That does raise an interesting question: who's more important - the creator of a product or the person who sells it? This leads to another question: Who cares? In this movie Steve Jobs is depicted as supercilious, pushy, arrogant, argumentative and self-centered. Not exactly the most attractive qualities to show on the screen. Who wants to watch a movie about a grouchy guy? To balance this, the movie includes a stock character, the faithful assistant, played by Kate Winslet as Ms Hoffman. But even she has her run-ins with the moody Jobs. He gets along with no one. This raises yet another question: if Jobs is so prissy and nasty, then how is it that he managed to be such a huge success in an industry that required the ability to mobilize highly educated and intellectually gifted people and gain their cooperation? Jobs must have been doing something right."

","With such wonderful material in Walter Isaacson's book, I do not understand why Sorkin, one of my favorite writers, chose to focus on such a narrow part of Steve Job's life. For example, in the book, Joanna Hoffman was a good early colleague, but in the movie becomes nearly a focal point. Same with his troubled relationship with his daughter. Here was a story that did not need the fictionalized inserts.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, but isn't it curious that the two leads were Brits who needed dialect coaches? We're there no qualified, available American actors?<br/><br/>Know, too, that the action here takes place 20-30 years ago, and portrays some early corporate infighting during a time when Apple's success was anything but assured."

The film may seem a bit slow, with lots and lots of dialogue, which there are, but that did not bother me at all. <br/><br/>Danny Boyle did a very good job connecting Jobs' different disputes or arguments he had with certain people in the past to the present events in the film. We get to see how important it was for Jobs to achieve what he wanted to, and for him to succeed other had to suffer. Michael Fassbender portrays Jobs as a very cold and arrogant person, and makes it very believable. He shows us why he got his second Academy Awards nomination for this role, and I surely wouldn't be surprised if he came out on top. <br/><br/>The credit should also go out to the supporting actors who did a very fine job as well. Seth Rogen, Kate Winslet and especially Jeff Daniels. He plays John Sculley, the president of Apple Inc at the time. He brings so much dynamic and friction to this film and made the entire experience very memorable. He is such an underrated actor and for me he deserved the Oscar nod for best supporting actor over Kate Winslet - though Winslet did a very good job as Joanna Hoffman; the marketing executive of Apple Inc.<br/><br/>You really feel for the people around Steve Jobs. They've got to handle his big personality and ,for lack of a better word, ""I'm better than you""-attitude.

","Steven Jobs plays out like a four-act play with each act being a product launch. The associated side stories take precedence over actual launch events, they're just a clever device used to tell the story. This isn't a movie about science and technology, rather about a spectacularly flawed, brilliant, and undeniably narcissistic visionary. I purposely do not use the term genius which I think, too many documentaries regarding Jobs have posited.<br/><br/>The structure of the movie works because of the way it allows one to see inside the tumultuous battles of Jobs, with his employees, the Apple board, and his daughter (and her mother), They existed side by side, and, strangely, this enabled the viewer to be appalled for the most part while still, on occasion, feeling a strange empathy.<br/><br/>This isn't a feel good movie. It doesn't over celebrate even the fact Jobs lead Apple back from being one quarter from oblivion. It probably even barely shows how difficult Jobs was. It seems to accomplish a lot by not trying to do a lot in the final analysis. Fine performances from Kate Winslet (assistant Joanna Hoffman), Seth Rogen (Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak), Jeff Daniels (Apple CEO John Sculley), and three young actresses playing Job's daughter Lisa Brennan bring these integral people to a seldom seen place where they live and breathe. You can feel their anger and frustration with Jobs who they should have all turned away from, but couldn't.

It's not told in the usual way that a biography film is, in which we are taken through a person's entire life. Here, we are given three big events in Jobs career, the product launch of his three major creations, along the way we are given a lot of information on his personal life. It is very engaging, as we see him communicate with family members, work colleagues and close friends, and it shows just how complicated and hard working this man really was. <br/><br/>My only real issue with this movie is that it feels rushed, it has a two hour run, and if felt as if it would not allow itself be any longer. A film about someone like Jobs could have easily been three hours. It felt a little vague on certain details in his life that many people watching this movie might not have been aware of, likely as a result of trying to keep a reasonably short run, which I found unnecessary. <br/><br/>The cast is superb and they all deserve a huge path on the back for their excellent work. Michael Fassbender took my breath away in the lead role, he never leaves the screen and you never want him to, Seth Rogen has never been better as he delivers a surprisingly breathtaking performance as Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Kate Winslet is almost unrecogniseable as Joanna Hoffman and delivers some of her best acting in years, and Jeff Daniels had a very powerful presence as John Scully, they all deserve Oscar nominations as they truly became and embodied their role. Director Danny Boyle also deserves credit for making his best film yet, in my opinion. <br/><br/>It is personal and unique in telling Jobs' story, it does not try to spoon feed us information, but merely to get a great feel for these events in the man's life. Huge praise is deserved for this well acted and superbly written film, it's emotional, breathtaking and I would certainly watch it again, I would recommend Steve Jobs to anyone looking for a good drama or biography film. <br/><br/>We're taken inside the private life of Steve Jobs as he psychically and emotionally prepares for his three biggest product launches. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Michael Fassbender"

Each act takes place backstage right before Steve goes on to announce the product and the trials he must endure with his friends and enemies. Each act, Steve converses with Steve Wozniak(Seth Rogen), Johanna Hoffman(Kate Winslet), John Sculley(Jeff Daniels), Andy Hertzfeld(Michael Stuhlbarg), and Chrisann Brennan(Katherine Waterston).<br/><br/>The film I found to be extremely interesting. Apart from the snappy and well written dialogue Sorkin is known for, the choices made in the film I found to be quite fitting. There was some really exceptional cinematography, and all of the acting was great, especially Fassbender. An interesting stylistic choice Boyle made was that act one was filmed entirely in 16mm film, the second in 35mm, and act 3 in digital to give the film a real feel of technological progression. I've always loved Danny Boyle's stylization in his movies, and that I thought was a fantastic choice.<br/><br/>I'd give this a recommendation.

She had the most emotional parts of the film.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen and Jeff Daniels shared the screen momentarily but it all felt too quick to make much of an impression.<br/><br/>Though I like the direction, overall I thought Boyle's film felt a bit too rushed and since I've heard some of the production woes, this may have been result of a forced film. The box office does not look positive though it may stick around if it continues to get good word of mouth. I'm not even sure this will make it in my top ten this year though.

"daleanne-75782","2","2","6","9 May 2016"," Boring Movie
","I tried to like this movie but after one too many scenes of Steve Jobs arguing with someone I was ready for the movie to move on. The acting was fine but good acting doesn't always mean a good movie. Michael Fassbender never really captured the essence of Steve Jobs in my opinion. The movie threw out names such as Daniel Kottke but never explained who he was or what his relationship was to Steve. This was true of most of the characters. Also, if you don't know much or anything about how Apple started, you won't learn it from this movie. Even though most people won't agree with me, I actually liked the Ashton Kutcher movie ""Jobs"". The characters were well developed and Kutcher transformed himself into an uncanny Steve Jobs even down to the way he walked. For a more in depth well rounded movie, try watching this movie instead."
"cosmo_tiger","6","2","6","28 December 2015"," This is not a bio-pic in the traditional sense. The acting is great, but the Kutcher movie was much better in my opinion.
","""How come 10 times a day I read Steve Jobs is a genius? What do you do?"" Steve Jobs (Fassbender) has a brilliant technological mind. He wants to put a computer in every home and every school and make it easy for everyone to use. From the introduction of the Mac in 1984 to the iMAC in 1998 he was at the forefront of every great technological advancement, and failure. As great of a computer man as he was he seemed to fail at every other aspect of his life. I know Steve Jobs was a genius, but I wondered why there needed to be two movies about him made. The Ashton Kutcher one did a great job of chronicling his life, making it interesting and finding out what made him how he was. This one does not do any of that. The movie follows Steve at three different product launches. The movie goes back and forth between showing what a horrible father he was, and what a horrible ""friend"" he was. This is not a bio-pic in the traditional sense. The acting is great, but I all I got from this movie is that he was a very egotistical and stubborn man who never found good in others. I'm not sure if that is true or not, but if it is there certainly shouldn't have been a movie made about him, let alone two. Overall, good acting but the Kutcher movie was much better in my opinion. I give this a disappointing B-."
"tomshanahan","4","2","6","25 November 2015"," Interesting but slow moving
","I found the movie to be interesting, profiling Steve Jobs as a very intense and not very likable man.( Accurate profile). The movie was very intense which I would regard as a positive bur extremely slow moving which I felt to be a negative. It concentrates on a very short and defined part of Jobs life and didn't give a lot of background as to how he set up the company. Both Fassbender and Winslet played their parts well.Jobs had also to deal with personal issues related to ex- girlfriend Chrisann Brennan and their young daughter Lisa. Eventually fired, Jobs launches NeXT Inc. and prepares to release a new computer model in 1988. Ten years later, Jobs is back at Apple Inc. and about to revolutionize the industry once again with the iMac."
"junkmail-385","5","2","6","1 November 2015"," Sorkin's attempt to rewrite history
","The scenes and dialog in Steve Jobs are well-written and reasonably well-acted but stunningly, they contain rapid-fire misinformation--often here and gone before the largely ignorant audience even knows it--that is purely of Aaron Sorkin's invention concerning the early life and times of Steve Jobs the human being. Yes, Jobs renounced his daughter Lisa early on, which is the largest element of the movie's storyline, but she was living with her father before she began high school, not estranged from him well into college.<br/><br/>Jobs and Apple did not steal the graphical user interface from Xerox/PARC, they bought it fair and square--before Bill Gates found out about the opportunity--then turned it into a rich, mature product that mere mortals could afford. The Xerox/PARC version required a $100K computer and used an unwieldy mouse. The Apple version ran on a $2500 computer using a $15 mouse, and the graphical interface included folders and drop-down menus which the world has taken for granted for 3 decades but that the Xerox/PARC version lacked.<br/><br/>Time magazine had indeed originally planned to appoint Steve Jobs as its Man of the Year--which is why Jobs gave Time reporters such open access to Apple; the cheap papier-mache sculpture that appeared instead of Jobs on the magazine cover supports--not undermines--Jobs' claim that Time changed its mind.<br/><br/>Steve Wozniak was not around during the time periods covered in the movie. He crashed a private plane and suffered a severe concussion in about 1981 that forced him into immediate retirement, years before this movie's storyline even began.<br/><br/>No way in h*ll did Jobs launch his NeXT computer company and risk his entire fortune with the expectation it would fail or be acquired by Apple. <br/><br/>As a software developer, I lived in the SF Bay Area through and beyond the early Apple and NeXT eras. Avie Tevanian was an operating systems guru hired out of graduate school by Jobs to work at NeXT and to bring with him the Mach OS kernel he invented at Carnegie Mellon University. Long before the NeXT Cube was introduced, the computer would have been running the Mach OS. The demos would not have run without an OS, despite Sorkin's claim to the contrary which (among other fabricated events) seems aimed squarely at disparaging Jobs' ethics. Apps simply don't run on hardware without an OS. They don't now and they didn't then. Sorkin attempts to portray Jobs as unethical for demonstrating a computer ""without an OS"", which I've indicated is patently erroneous. But notice that the computer wasn't yet for sale, because the computer wasn't yet ready, and this was proper and ethical of Jobs. There is nothing illegal or even unethical about demonstrating a product before its release. But that doesn't stop Sorkin from trying to convince the audience otherwise.<br/><br/>In ""artistic"" fashion, Sorkin has Jobs speaking repeatedly with John Scully over the infamous boardroom decision that ousted Jobs from Apple. In reality, the two men never spoke again. While the memory of that incident would have been painful for Jobs, I sincerely doubt it had any bearing on his psyche in the intense lead-up to product announcements.<br/><br/>Sorkin contrasts the hooting and stomping of Apple fans waiting in the audience at each product announcement to the pettiness and vitriol he imagines spewing from Jobs behind the curtain. But all real-world accounts of Apple product announcements from employees who were there under Jobs' leadership indicate that they were hectic, highly rehearsed and focused events. Do you think Sorkin was obsessing over his divorce in the lead-up to his promotional gigs for this movie? I don't think so.<br/><br/>Little of Jobs' charismatic drive comes through in the movie. Instead it's all about Jobs' personal failures--planned, imagined and otherwise--as choreographed by the screenplay writer.<br/><br/>The studio paid Walter Isaacson millions of dollars for the rights to his authorized biography of Steve Jobs, but that money was wasted, the plot is so diverged from reality. I would challenge Sorkin to indicate what elements of the book he used. My take on the movie is that Sorkin is a technology numbskull who could not grasp the real Steve Jobs story, so he focused on human emotions, which he does understand, and invented a plot in another universe for his own amusement and that of an ignorant public."

","Very annoying, tedious movie in the beginning, all the arguing and bickering takes away from who Steve Jobs was. They could have gotten a better actor (Christian Bale would have been better) than the one in this movie, although towards the end he makes a more believable older Steve Jobs than he did a younger one. I found this movie tedious already knowing the story. However, this story line was very hard to follow with all the fighting, in fact I feel like the whole movie was fighting. It's one of the worst Steve Jobs movies ever. I love the very first movie years ago, The Pirates of Silicone Valley and then Jobs was good along with Bill Gates. Both Noah Wiley and Ashton Kuchner added more character than the constant grouchyness that Fassbender portrayed.<br/><br/>The bickering and arguing really take away from the movie.<br/><br/>Whoever wrote the story for this movie must have hated Steve Jobs because they did a terrible portrayal of him."

Instead I found myself saying things to myself like ""I hope Steve and Woz don't end up ripping each other apart"" and ""Don't let go of Lisa, Steve"".<br/><br/>There is absolutely no denying the huge shadow that Steve Jobs left on the world. If you approached 200 people just randomly on the streets and asked if they knew Steve Jobs, they would say yes 99% of the time. Everyone knows Apple. Everyone knows the MacBook. Everyone knows the name ""Steve Jobs"". However, they don't know the true story. This is that story.<br/><br/>On the technical side this movie knocks it out of the park.

"aniruddha-madduri","10","1","2","19 March 2017"," The biopic that is a character study.
","I am a big fan of Aaron Sorkin's work. I have re-watched most of his work, including the Academy Award winning ""The Social Network"", and the courtroom drama ""A Few Good Men"", and his TV shows ""The West Wing"", ""Studio 60"" and also ""The Newsroom"". All his movies have dialogue which feels organic, natural, and sing-song. And when I heard he would be writing the new Steve Jobs movie, and that it was to be directed by Danny Boyle, I was eagerly waiting for its release. And boy! My expectations were blown away! REMEMBER!! THIS MOVIE IS NOT A BIOPIC!! IT IS A CHARACTER STUDY!!! Everything about this movie is perfect. The casting, the performances, the set design, the background music and the dialogue, all are EXCEPTIONAL. The movie follows a three-act format, each set before the launch of an important product. Unlike the earlier Steve Jobs movie ""Jobs"" (which is a blow-by-blow biopic of the great man), this movie is a more intricate tale of how the man was. In a day and age where a biopic just gives you details of what happened in the subject's life, this movie comes off as a breath of fresh air. Whichever interaction one takes, whether it be between Jobs and Joanna Hoffmann, or Jobs and Lisa (his daughter), or Jobs and Wozniak, or Jobs and John Sculley, all give an in-depth look into Steve Jobs' life. But for me personally, the conversation between Jobs and John Sculley, in the one hour mark is probably one of the greatest ever sequence of dialogue I have ever seen. That scene shows the incredible talent of Aaron Sorkin, the editor Elliot Graham, the music composer Daniel Pemberton, the cinematographer Alwin H. Küchler, the director Danny Boyle and Michael Fassbender, Jeff Daniels and Kate Winslet. The performances from everyone is top-notch. As mentioned earlier, Michael Fassbender is magnificent, Kate Winslet slips into the role of Joanna Hoffman effortlessly, Seth Rogen is brilliant as Steve Wozniak, the three actresses who portrayed Lisa Brennan Jobs, were brilliant!! Amazing movie!! A perfect score!!"
"crash21","5","1","2","1 October 2016"," Just plain awful
","I will agree with this movie a few places, Steve Jobs was a person that asked everyone for a lot, frequently more than the people even thought was possible, but he did at least do this trying to inspire everyone to do the absolute best they can do. I think this movie over-dramatized a lot of Steve Jobs' more negative moments, at least one of which, included a lot of drama in his family situations.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of Apple Computer or the person Steve Jobs, but I have to say that this movie was just plain bad, and not because it was simply about Steve Jobs. The whole movie was just plain slow, they don't give you much to explain the scenes that you are watching, and even though it has some real-life based moments. The movie tends to be over-dramatized practically everywhere you watch. When I saw it, I thought that the whole movie has you looking at Steve Jobs like he was an evil industry gangster or some other kind of organized-crime factor in the IT field. He was hard on people, that's a fact, but there were some good times in there too.<br/><br/>I agree with other comments that said to watch TNT's ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"" instead, it is truly so much better than this. Or even the old PBS documentary ""Triumph of the Nerds"", it explains a lot of the real-life moments in this movie's story and even gives you real-life interviews with some of the people."
"Freedom060286","5","1","2","9 March 2016"," Superb cast but poor screen writing
","This movie features excellent performances by Kate Winslet, Michael Fassbender and Jeff Daniels. The direction and cinematography is okay, but the screen writing leaves much to be desired.<br/><br/>The writer focuses almost entirely on the difficulties in Steve Jobs relationships with those around him. I think the movie is unfair and degrading not only to Jobs, but to several of those most important to him such as Steve Wozniak, John Scully and (his daughter?) Lisa. <br/><br/>It would have been better if the movie went deeper into the historical importance of each advancement in the computer industry. It barely mentions that the NeXT Computer and NeXTSTEP operating system were the platform used for creating the World Wide Web. <br/><br/>Instead we are given a series of nasty, personal arguments backstage involving Jobs and several important people in his life moments before three iconic product launches."
"josa951-886-293471","8","1","2","2 March 2016"," Great movie, I recommend every technology enthusiast to watch
","Great movie, excellent dialogues. Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet definitely deserved to get nominated for Oscars. I like the fact that they even shot each of the three acts in a different visual format: The 1984 launch of the Mac was done on 16-millimeter film, 1988's NeXT event was shot on 35 millimeter and 1998's iMac launch was shown via the digital ALEXA system. Doyle not only shot the story in sequence, he made time for weeks long rehearsal periods before each section was filmed. Though it will undoubtedly mean more to people somewhat intimately familiar with Apple's history, Steve Jobs is a nevertheless affecting piece of cinema that never attempts to canonise its subject matter. Jobs is a man of enormous self-confidence, driven like nobody's business, whose powers of persuasion are so overpowering his employees talk about the ""reality distortion field"" he is able to create around himself and his ideas. Amazing movie!"
"palavitsinis","6","1","2","29 February 2016"," Lacks a lot of background
","Michael Fassbender was awesome. I think that there will never be a better embodiment of Steve Jobs. I do. Kate Winslet (one of the most beautiful actresses for me) was also breathtaking. Apart from that, the movie itself was nothing special. I mean, if you don't know (and why should you) the story of apple inside out, there's no point in viewing this movie! I found the story really really confusing at times, which left me wondering about almost everything that was going on. <br/><br/>First of all, I didn't appreciate the giant leaps that the movie took, breaching the continuity of the script. One of the factors that made me get lost this one. Apart from that, I am kind of confused what they are trying to depict here. Cause if it's the father-daughter relationship, then they failed. And if it was the mind-games, the plots, etc. behind Jobs' career, they failed again. Too many stuff in too little of screen time overall. <br/><br/>What is the director after? Showing how Jobs was transformed as a father from a negative paternal figure to a positive one? This was not the case. The guy was only good to his child when she was playing with the Mac or later when he made it big time with the launch of the iMac. In the meantime, he was a shitty father. No role model there, no example for no one! <br/><br/>Throughout the movie, Jobs was completely incapable of rising above his own misery or success, to face the needs of his child. And by the way, saying that he will put his daughter's music in her pocket, was not at all awesome or worth mentioning in the end. It did not mend anything. His child was just accepting his lousy character all along. I suppose that we will be expecting more and more Jobs movies in the years to come. I would wish the opposite. Why? Cause some stories are not worth telling, no matter how many apples are attached to them..."
"tomgillespie2002","6","1","2","24 February 2016"," Finds the soul within the bully
","Since his death in 2011, the world - including those who had never heard of the turtle-neck-sporting tech genius and innovator - has come to learn that the great Steve Jobs was in fact a massive dick. Like every great man, the flaws in his personality have been forgiven or excused in favour of a 'tortured genius' label, but this has not stopped various movies and documentaries cropping up to try and paint a true-to-life picture. Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs, starring Michael Fassbender in the title role, likes to think that his humanity emerged with his advancing years, as he went about literally changing the way we live our lives.<br/><br/>If you're someone who proudly boasts about the lack of a Facebook profile or prefers to stare out of the window during a bus-ride as opposed to staring open-mouthed at your phone, then the tech-worship and subtle hints at the innovations Jobs would go on to create may completely pass you by. I like to think I'm one of those people, but I felt like I may as well be carrying a spear and wearing a bear- skin when the 3G disappeared from my phone the other day. The film's narrative disregards the traditional biopic formula in favour of three 30 minute-plus acts, each set just before the launch of three of Jobs most famous creations - the Apple Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the game-changing iMac in 1998.<br/><br/>Throughout the years, a set of key characters mingle and/or class with Jobs. Headstrong marketing executive Joan Hoffman (Kate Winslet) tries to bring the best out of her boss, but is visibly appalled when he repeatedly denies that he is the father of Lisa (played by Makenzie Moss, Ripley Sobo and Perla Haney-Jardine at various ages), often to her face. Old friend Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) asks him to acknowledge the efforts of the Apple II team during his presentation, much to Jobs' disgust, but fails when Jobs is fired by Apple after the failure of the Macintosh. His boss John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) finds himself blamed for Jobs' sacking in the media when he repeatedly stuck up for him and warned him of the repercussions of failing to lower the Macintosh's price.<br/><br/>Fassbender, although sharing little physical resemblance to the man, is outstanding, playing Jobs with a faint (and ironic) disconnection to the world and little grasp of how he is perceived by others. Aaron Sorkin, who is on script duties, goes overtime with the fast and jargon-heavy talk, and the film is rich with his signature corridor-pacing conversations. The decision to condense his key years into three acts offers a fresh take on the usual incident-by- incident biographies, but it also means that characters are ushered into scenes unnaturally to resolve their personal conflict, with Wozniak especially reduced to a conduit for the audience. Boyle's direction is refreshingly unflashy when compared to the senses- rattling Trance (2013), and instead allows his actors and their quick-fire dialogue to breathe freely. It certainly falls short the other biopic of a technological innovator - The Social Network (2010) - but, despite its flaws, it still manages to find a soul within its obnoxious bully."
"Semisonic","9","1","2","24 February 2016"," A good movie about a bad person
","It's quite difficult to expect to be amazed by a movie about a person you don't really like, who founded a company you're not a fan of, which produces gadgets you've never bought and will never buy. Especially since there was a movie about the same guy and the same company just a year ago. Which had a guy who looked so much more like the real-life Steve Jobs but still didn't pull it off for me.<br/><br/>Well, sometimes the expectations are to be exceeded. And what 'Jobs' failed to achieve, 'Steve Jobs' - by some uncanny magic or a dirty marketing trick - kinda managed to accomplish. It managed to show us the history of Apple and the key people behind it as a story of real people, not just look-alike moving and talking puppets. It managed to create drama which you don't just observe but instead feel to the marrow of your bones. And - despite being a movie about one big egotistical megalomaniac piece of sh!t of a person - it turned out to be a movie which you actually wanna like and end up doing so.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender did one amazing and pretty impressive thing playing Steve Jobs for this flick. He actually proved that you don't have to look like a historical person to succeed at conveying him or her. Quite the contrary, it's the fact that they didn't even try to mess up with Fassbender's appearance to make him look more like Jobs that sold me on this one. Because it basically shows that you may look like anyone or anything, even like a giant talking papier-mache head, but if you truly live into your character then the audience would also believe it and after some time it would not even matter how you look. Although, and i have to admit this, by the time the movie reaches its apogee, Fassbender starts kinda resembling (in the physical sense) the person he was called in to portray. Not that it's a bad thing in the first place.<br/><br/>Another thing 'Steve Jobs' did right is by almost completely avoiding the bureaucracy of the business making. All these board meetings, corporate intrigues, ""which department gets more financing"" kind of stuff - all scratched out to make more room for what really makes this film stand out: the human side of every business. We finally get to see that it's not just Jobs who has any substantial personality, that both Wozniak and Sculley were deep and consistent and actually sympathetic people, and that even some engineer guys may have enough soul and guts to be given the screen time. Which only proves one big message most Apple fanboys don't wanna see: Apple is not just success, and Apple's success is not just Steve Jobs.<br/><br/>The two hours of this film didn't tell me much new about Apple or its products, and they certainly didn't depict Jobs as a person less unpleasant as i've come to imagine him to be. Still, those two hours were not wasted in vain, because no matter if you love Apple or his infamous co-founder or not, it's a company that did a lot to make the world of today what it is, and the people behind it deserve the tribute this film paid to them, even if some self-endorsing glorification couldn't have been avoided. At least it did mention some right things, showed some right choices being made and some true effort to be acknowledged. And if you need some photo flashes and an upbeat Google Zeitgeist-like hipster music to keep you on the edge of your seat and fully immersed - then why the hell not?"
"Reno-Rangan","8","1","2","24 February 2016"," Pretty impressive narration, a better version out there for now.
","US film or UK film is not an issue, but the real question was the second movie required? Plenty of films are made in a short period of gap about the same person like 'Infamous' and 'Capote', themes like 'Olympus Has Fallen' and 'White House Down', and sometimes remakes like 'Deaths at a Funeral' from other film industries. So the history says audience accepts only they are different from each other and so this film was, but very very sad it bombed at the box office.<br/><br/>Like everybody I was not interested in this, even though it was from a renowned filmmaker. But after watching it now, I felt I was terribly wrong. Actually, this is the best version so far about the Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs. It was entirely a different narration than the previous one, everything was like the backstage drama that takes place before every product launch. That means most of the film was shot in the auditoriums and its corridor, parking lot, rooftop, and other surround places.<br/><br/>All the affairs like family, friends, co-founders, business, troubles et cetera are brought into one place and dealt there itself. Surely a very cleverly written screenplay and display by the actors, especially the two Oscars nominee Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslate. Once again Danny Boyle proved his directional skill with this beautiful biopic. I did not LIKE the end scene, but LOVED it. In fact, this film's end and Ashton Kutcher film's opening scenes has a clean follow. I also felt the movie was very honest, but I don't how much since I'm not into the books to learn about the famous personalities. It's not a must see, but definitely worth a try.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This is a simple review. Perhaps it is most helpful to compare this to The Social Network (even though the two films are not technically parallel, Jobs being a partial-career-biopic). The Social Network emphasized the rise of the company Facebook, with the person, Mark Zuckerberg, as the central figure. Steve Jobs emphasized the person, Jobs, with the company he began, Apple. Both, however, relate to companies that are at the heartbeat of American society, technology and Silicon Valley today. <br/><br/>The Social Network was crisp, fast-paced, Sorkin at his best, fascinating tale of the explosive rise of Facebook.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs, on the other hand came across as Sorkin-esque, and had quality at a few points, yet seemed more appropriately Sorkin-exhausted ... as if he were just tired of writing and his pen finally capitulated to writing cramps a couple of hours in. The story struck me as an almost entirely negative portrayal without any true redeeming elements (except in the Steve Wozniak character - well-played by Seth Rogan). Perhaps that was intentional - to reveal a Steve Jobs who was a completely self-absorbed megalomaniac. Perhaps Sorkin was attempting to write a morality play on how some individuals are so focused on their own intelligence and power that they cannot relate to others on a truly personal level. Perhaps also that is what Jobs was really like. I have no idea. I'll leave that judgment to others. <br/><br/>How this won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay over Spotlight or The Big Short is beyond comprehension. Both of those screenplays were head and shoulders superior to Steve Jobs.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, while the acting was decent, and the film got off to an interesting start, I found that when the film ended, I felt short-changed and negative. So did those who viewed it with me. <br/><br/>As to the acting, you'll note that Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet both received Oscar as well as Golden Globe noms (and Winslet winning the Globe). Both are superb actors in general. And, both did quality work here. But, I found Winslet's character to be a bit up and down. I don't think it was her best role by far and don't believe she deserves an Oscar win for certain (it wasn't until her second main scene that I realized she was a foreigner - and her accent seemed to fade in and out - stronger, then blander - throughout the movie). Fassbender did a fine job but he is not close to the level of, say, Brian Cranston's work in Trumbo (which was genius)."

","Steve Jobs, starring Michael Fassbender, is the partial story of Apple Computers and the man behind it for much of the time: Steve Jobs.<br/><br/>Jobs is a control freak, quite possibly afflicted with Asperger's. In the movie this is all traced back to the fact that his biological mother gave him up for adoption.<br/><br/>Many people have a love/hate relationship with him, especially some of the other people at Apple: Steve Wozniak, John Scully, and Joanna Hoffman. <br/><br/>Jobs wasn't interested in people adapting his inventions, so what he invented was something that couldn't be used with anything else. He wasn't interested in what people wanted, he was interested in his vision.<br/><br/>He denies that his daughter Lisa is his and allows her and her mother to live on welfare and Lisa to sleep in a parka because her mother can't afford heat. Eventually some of this is resolved. <br/><br/>The film shows us the day he launched three products: 1984, the Macintosh computer, 1988 for the NeXT computer, after he was ousted from Apple, and in 1998 for the iMAC computer.<br/><br/>Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) sees Jobs as the broad picture man, while he is the nuts and bolts. The two are often at odds, and Wozniak doesn't feel that Steve respects him. Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) is his head of marketing. She's not afraid to tell him off. Lastly, John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) who is interested basically in what the Board and shareholders want. <br/><br/>The main problem that I had with this film is that they never shut up I love a lot of dialogue in films, I'm from the old school, but the script just wasn't witty enough in my mind to support all the tech talk, the arguing, the yelling that went on.<br/><br/>The other problem I had was that Jobs is so unlikable one can't connect with him. You don't get to be Steve Jobs by being Mr. Nice Guy but on the other hand, do you have to be so awful to people? I can appreciate his brilliance, his vision, both of which we've seen play out over the years in incredible products, but he was pretty rotten.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender is terrific as Jobs - self-absorbed, vain, arrogant, smart, and stubborn. It took me a while to realize I was looking at Kate Winslet as Joanna - she was terrific, creating a very in-depth character who had a complicated relationship with Jobs but is able to strike a chord with him regarding his family. Seth Rogen is perfect as Wozniak, a real geek, sweet, and exploding when needed. Jeff Daniels, a favorite of the writer, Aaron Sorkin's, is a shark sometimes and then other times a real friend.<br/><br/>I like both the work of Aaron Sorkin and Danny Boyle, the director, a lot of the time and then other times, I don't. I feel as if Sorkin sometimes does too much with scenes of people speaking over one another to the point of confusion, and Boyle - well, he can be totally off the wall. I'd put this one in the middle for both of them.<br/><br/>Great ensemble acting, a powerful story that could have been much more powerful with maybe a slightly different or opened up focus. But with such an unpleasant person, it probably wasn't worth it."

","Steve Jobs takes an interesting look at this man's life. This is by no means great, but it a solid movie. <br/><br/>The highlight was obviously Michael Fassbender. He rightfully got an Oscar nomination as he turned out a great performance as Jobs. His acting is authentic and he really connected with the dialogue throughout. He really was fantastic. Kate Winslet and Seth Rogen were both good as well, but I honestly think Winslet's performance is a tad overrated. She was average. Rogen put in a better performance than I expected. Who knew Rogan could act in a drama?? He was definitely a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>The writing was also pretty well done. The dialogue was presented well as the story unfolded. The conversations moved along quickly, but seemed realistic. There were plenty of eye opening moments that really spoke to who Steve Jobs was, or how they wanted to present him at least. The only downfall was some slow parts. There were a few lull moments that really took away from the story. I found myself losing some interest. <br/><br/>One complaint was the lack of Woz. I wanted more of his story to combat Steve Jobs' story. Rogen did an excellent job portraying Woz, and he was obviously a huge part of the business. His lack of involvement was disappointing. <br/><br/>Steve Jobs is really worth the watch. The acting was very nicely done and the story was pretty well presented. This is by no means a masterpiece, but still good. If nothing else, make sure you get a chance to see Fassbender's portrayal! 7/10"

","Was waiting for this movie, which can be seen as a 3rd installment in an Aaron Sorkin trilogy about real-life visionaries which includes ""Social Network"" and ""Moneyball"". I loved both those movies and thought Steve Jobs the man was perfect subject for another one - he himself seemed like a larger then life character from Sorkin's page.<br/><br/>With a very skillful and versatile director Danny Boyle and great cast what could go wrong?<br/><br/>Actually I was disappointed. All the parts seemed good - acting, direction, music - but it didn't add up. Sorkin dialogue seemed tired, overwrought and sometimes looking like self-parody. The film seemed artificial. Bret Ellis called this film stillborn and I'd say there is a grain of truth in it. I would say the main reason for this film being ""less then sum of its parts"" is probably Sorkin screenplay. He just didn't get it right this time, it seems.<br/><br/>However the film is engaging and I was surprised how good and sometimes dark the lead performance by Michael Fassbender was - I was surprised how pathological Jobs looked in some moments. Another reviewer compared him to Jake Gyllenhaal in ""Nightcrawler"" and funny enough there is something to this comparison, which tells you how abnormal Jobs, at least as portrayed in this film, is. <br/><br/>In the end, a good watch, great performances but could have been more."
"radamanthe","7","1","2","21 January 2016"," Interesting but not gripping
","Good attempt at portraying the man behind Apple. The movie doesn't provide a time-line of Jobs at Apple, it instead offers an examination of his personality through his interactions with people that played an important part in his life, such as Steve Wozniak and his daughter who he initially refused to acknowledge. It definitely isn't a hagiography, and i understand that a lot of people may not like that fact, nevertheless it provides an insightful view at his controversial personality. The script is typical Sorkin, intelligent and staccato-paced and the acting is also very good. Fassbender and Winslet are standouts as expected and their Oscar nominations are well-deserved. Nevertheless i found that this movie failed to convey the emotional impact that Jobs' personality and tumultuous relationships deserved. The result is that the movie eventually fizzles instead of soaring."

","Who knew you could fill two whole hours with arguing in empty rooms at conference venues? This film is a 'must watch' for fans of stacked chairs and fire doors. But don't worry, there's no danger of nodding off, because there is plenty of shouting and raised voices to keep you awake. <br/><br/>On the plus side the cast do the best they can with such an uninspiring script and Kate Winslett has definitely done her homework accent-wise. It is also a great relief that Fassbender has made no attempt to mimic Jobs. <br/><br/>Probably my favourite aspect are the arguments about a previous argument where the two arguments, past and present, are cut into each other. Why watch one fight, when you can watch two? But content aside I though it kept the narrative efficient and helped the pace.<br/><br/>In the unlikely event that you don't know Steve Jobs' story and the history of Apple already, I suspect you'll come out of this movie a little non-plussed as very little is actually explained or described. It is very much an examination of who Jobs was as a person rather than his biography.<br/><br/>From an entertainment perspective, I much preferred the film Jobs (2013).

"aharmas","6","1","2","25 October 2015"," Talented? Not Charming At All
","If there's a reason to see this movie, it is: Michael Fassbender,a performer who channels the essence of the character, be it real or fictitious. His addict in ""Shame"" seduces everything in sight and breaks your heart when one realizes how corroded his existence is. The tortured man in ""12 Years a Slave"" befuddles us with the love/hate affair, full of guilt that he carries on with one of his slaves. Here, he portrays an iconic figure that very few people really knew but many endured. If we can say the adaptation is based on factual evidence, we can certainly pity the individuals who got too close. <br/><br/>According to the film, he felt he had enough talent to believe in himself and his creations. It seemed as if he didn't appreciate their contributions but used them. One particularly upsetting moment in the film has him threatening one of his former partners/employees, failing to admit or recognize the other's contributions. It feels like he's running a plantation, with employees being nothing more than slaves. There's very little to like about this man.<br/><br/>Then we have the family angle, and it's even more problematic because even though he is given information in numbers, he still chooses to believe whatever he wants. It doesn't matter that his daughter hears or sees the poison coming out of his mouth. Even his faithful assistance tries to find ways to lessen the possible psychological damage to the child, but it seems to matter little to him until the child ""plays"" with one of his programs. Then he chooses to reward her.<br/><br/>There are other moments when you wonder what's going on in this film. It's like the stage is set to show us how idolized he is. However, we can't help feeling it's all a set up. Are these real people or hired help to fill the auditorium? You can never feel even admiration. It's all choreographed to look like something, with little emotional resonance.<br/><br/>Overall, it's pretty hollow, with pretty, snappy dialogue, a very good performance by Fassbender but not much more, except two very long hours filled with what seems to be much earned devotion."

",". . . the current film STEVE JOBS makes crystal clear. STEVE JOBS is a wonderfully cast and acted movie, with witty writing, sharp editing, and great cinematography (particularly the close-up of Jobs' face as Andy lingers in the blurry background about 1:29:30 into this story). The plotting and editing of STEVE JOBS cuts to the chase incisively, boiling down the 14-year period from 1984 (and Apple's prophetic ""MacIntosh"" Super Bowl ad, forecasting how billions of iJobs ditto heads world-wide would morph into the Nazi sheep in the seats and NOT the sledge hammer-throwing chick!) to three key days, with a sprinkling of flashbacks and a generous use of composite characters. Coupled with THE SOCIAL NETWORK's documenting the Life and Crimes of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, JOBS shows that you do NOT need the fake villains of WALL STREET's Gordon ""Greed is Good"" Gecko or GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Kevin Spacey to prove that most if not all of America's One Per Cent mogul class are in league with the Devil. While flicks such as STEVE JOBS and SOCIAL NETWORK may feature ""feel good"" endings to put butts into theater seats, one cannot ignore the human carnage projected on-screen wreaked by the Zuckerbergs, Jobs, and Trumps plaguing today's America. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) tells Jobs ""It's not binary--you can be decent and talented at the same time."" Though that's probably True, what actually IS binary is that you CANNOT be both decent AND an American mogul. Some guys decide to become serial killers. Others kill the dreams of hundreds or thousands of 99-Per-Centers to become fabulously wealthy One Per Center fat cats such as Jobs, Zuckerberg, or Trump."
"StevePulaski","10","2","7","24 October 2015"," Indecent and gifted
","For a mainstream film about a technological titan, Danny Boyle's ""Steve Jobs"" is immensely subversive in the way that it rejects biopic convention to give us the parts of Jobs's story I'm sure many of us wouldn't have put near the top of our lists to see. The film focuses on the behind-the-scenes interworkings of three specific press conferences Jobs delivered: the first is the unveiling of the original Macintosh computer following an electrifying Super Bowl commercial in 1984, the second is the announcement of the NeXT Box, the debut hardware from Jobs's own company NeXT in 1988, and the final is the reveal of Jobs's iMac computer in 1998, after Jobs is rehired by Apple. Just as Jobs is about to stand before the crowd to give his press conferences, Boyle's camera cuts and Sorkin's script deviates to a transitory scene that takes place in the middle of the sequence we just watched and the sequence we're about to see.<br/><br/>What should've made for a disjointed and unnerving film instead creates a symphonic blend of sharp dialog, terrific character acting, and intimate character development and relations behind one of the most recognized names in the technology field. Michael Fassbender plays Steve Jobs, a wickedly smart but frequently condescending man, uncaring of what people think of him so long as he gets his vision out to the public. He's assisted, morally guided, and somewhat kept in line by his marketing adviser Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), especially when his daughter Lisa gets caught up in a brutal battle of paternity denial. Lisa's mother finds this a deplorable act of cowardice on Jobs' behalf; he finds it a setback and an attempt to devalue his name and career.<br/><br/>Boyle and writer Aaron Sorkin also show Jobs' relationship with Apple CEO John Scully (Jeff Daniels), who seems to always be on the opposite page of Jobs no matter the issue. Scully is a marketing and business traditionalist, ultimately concerned with promotion and the bottom dollar, where Jobs believes that innovation and creating something people didn't know they wanted should be the fundamental goal of a technology empire (in one brilliant scene, Jobs states, ""the person who said 'the customer is always right' was almost certainly a customer""). Finally, there's the long-developed and discussed relationship between Jobs and his college buddy Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen), who surprisingly takes a backseat to much of the action, only turning up to knock Jobs off his high-horse by reminding him that, despite him commanding the orchestra, he doesn't know how to make any of the parts move nor does he really do anything other than dictate and belittle.<br/><br/>I'm sure there were few people thinking Sorkin's screenplay for ""Steve Jobs"" wouldn't be top-notch, but I'm not sure many expected how sharp and biting the dialog of this film was going to be. Rather than focusing on capturing every noteworthy event of Jobs' life in a concise, completionist manner like the forgotten ""Jobs"" biopic two years ago, Sorkin focuses on the conversations between the people that made them happen. The dialog here is always alive, turning a two hour film into one that races past at lightning speed - something I don't say often.<br/><br/>But Sorkin's dialog would be of little merit if it wasn't recited by the immensely talented cast this film boasts. The supporting performances here are the kind of performances that transcend the power of the lesser characters in a film, and Jeff Daniels and Kate Winslet truly capitalize off of the power of their characters. Daniels works to make every line of dialog he says level-headed and understandable from his perspective, and Winslet, who ostensibly gets a very thankless role, turns her character into an undeniable force and commendable female supporting role. Winslet is as good as Fassbender, who ultimately is the beating heart of this film. Fassbender's ability to be as mesmerizing in his smugness and his confidence is what keeps this film watchable, in addition to his ability to be so interesting as he condescends people, using elaborate but believable dialog appropriate for a variety of situations. The only one who seems out of place here is indeed Rogen, who always looks and seems to feel like he's about to make some kind of a joke or a quip in every scene he's in.<br/><br/>Yet, ""Steve Jobs"" is a powerful and titillating film, proving my notion that films that dedicate themselves to profiling a character through dialog and his relations with others can be just as gripping as any action film you can name. This also serves as a cogent reminder to those who emptily praise Jobs without really understanding his character or his accomplishments. Political commentator and pundit Bill Maher pointed out an interesting note on this film, assuming it would be successful like many other biopics about cut-throat people of success, because America has a love for ""a**holes."" I don't disagree, but this film should be regarded like ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" in a way where neither the director or writer of the film actively condemns the titular figure, and instead simply allow for his actions to condemn and define himself before audiences."
"Kray_Kray","9","2","7","23 October 2015"," Masterful Movie Making
","LOVED Steve Jobs. Fassbender never misses a beat of the fast paced Sorkian repartee. Physically, he reminded me of a more youthful Jeremy Irons, laconic and restless, oddly both at ease with the environment he controls, and suspicious of it because it's not 100% fashioned in his image. The long walkie/talkie tracking shots, particularly those down corridors, seem just right to mirror his tunnel vision; and that decision to distinguish the acts with different film was brilliant – the first act is grainy, with a lot of saturated jewel tones, with a decidedly upbeat historical feel, when the second act switches from 16mm to 35mm, the emphasis on ""focusing"" on the new product line is visual as well as verbal, utter concentration, and the final digital act is crisp with more subdued colorsa lot of shades of gray. I noticed that the lighting brought out the hue changes of Fassbender's eyes; in the final act they were so steely they appeared silver. This film felt like nothing but nothing was left to chance, but it all unfolded naturally. The three acts fit together very well – the story was all of a piece, and although I had feared the father-daughter line would detract from the examination of Job's professional life, it was weaved in seamlessly, with perhaps just a tad overdoing in the final interaction between the two. Really nothing could have hit the broken part of Job's psyche – the consequences of the abandoned child – like the ambiguity of his parenthood.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was sublime. Daniels has read Sorkin's lines (in the Newsroom) so long now they seem to ooze out of him. Sculley came across as a very sympathetic character as well as an integral part of Job's business history. Daniels has that cynical-wise aura that is tempered by avuncular mannerisms. You really believed he loved the guy who got him fired, and that if had naturally had complex motives, the one that overwhelmingly won out was compassion. Seth Rogen, I think, was the perfect projection of the Steve Wozniak of our imaginations, based on what we have learned about him over the years. I read that Wozniak had a lot of input into how he would be portrayed, but nothing felt overly heroic or vengeful (and just the appropriate level of nerdy).This is the Wozniak I wanted to see in the film, fighting not for what was his, but what should have been shared – whether it was credit for his Apple II team or wanting 'open' products reflecting his conception of user friendliness, as opposed to Job's control mantra. Wozniak – the genius who would never dare tell anyone he knew what they wanted – everyone has to find that for herself. The philosophical differences on the open/controlled debate between Steve and Steve couldn't have been more finely drawn than if Bill Gates and Linus Torvalds had been set in a boxing ring. Michael Stulhbarg had some sweet scenes, and John Ortiz is starting to feel like an old friend every time he pops up.<br/><br/>But for me the player who really brought it was Winslet. Damnit, she looked so dowdy in the opening act all I could think of was Tilda Swinton's fanatic character in Snowpiercer, without the prosthetic teeth. But she grew more beautiful with every scene as she opened up the full marvel of Joanna Hoffman's roleand that was so much more than a Greek chorus of the better self she hoped for Jobs, but a brilliant, strategic, practical, and holistic woman in her own right. Winslet was a woman every wife, admin assistant, deputy will recognize; she's not just ""behind her man"", not just his ""better half"", not just his ""cheerleader', but the source of his ability to do his best. That Jobs and Hoffman weren't romantically involved made the relationship no less intimate. She could walk away, she was not completely possessed by his vision and persona, her strength was what was needed to slowly wear down, like water dripping on a rock, the cage around his heart. There need to be AWARDS for Kate for this one.<br/><br/>I left feeling what I knew I would – that this is Sorkin's movie more than anyone's , even Fassbender's. The double-edged sword of his dialogues, his confrontational verve, his ability to mask considerable exposition beneath riveting conversation – the man is just the master of the intelligent, fast-paced script. I think anyone will want to see this again and again, for a missed line, for another glimpse at how a great writer carves the parameters of character, and fashions scenes to reveal them. This screenplay is more Sorkin than even The Social Network; in Steve Jobs it looks like he had the leeway to go full virtuoso, the recurring Sorkian riffs playing like prime Jimmy Page at Earls Court."
"Dr_Ham","8","2","9","22 October 2015"," One of the Best Biopics this Decade
","Danny Boyle directs the Aaron Sorkin script based on various events during the life of Steve Jobs, and they knocked it so far out of the park that it will redefine how we look at biopics in the future. <br/><br/>What makes this piece so unique is how it first of all humanizes the main character to the point where he actually becomes unlikable. When dealing with such a popular icon as Jobs, one would imagine that movies about him would just focus on his brilliance and the impact he made on society, but not this one. Sorkin and Boyle show you that Steve Jobs was kind of a dick, and that he definitely wasn't perfect. This gives us a break from what we've been used to hearing about Jobs over the years, and allows for the biopic to show us a story that we don't know about, and the one that is more worth telling.<br/><br/>The manner in which the story was told was also quite brilliant, as the entire film took place during the moments before Jobs took the stage at three different product launches. They didn't actually show the launches, and the product was never the focus of these time periods. It was all about Steve, and his relationships with his co-workers, and his daughter. Because that is what a biopic should be. It doesn't need to just recreate moments that we all remember. It needs to showcase the moments that make these people who they are.<br/><br/>The Verdict:<br/><br/>The performances were wonderful, the writing was top notch, and the directing was some of the best of the year. Steve Jobs is a lightning bolt of energy that keeps you so interested that the two hour run time will feel like 30 minutes."

","I do not see the point of making movies about Steve Jobs at all. Unless someone wants to make money on a very famous name of our era. Steve was a wonderful biz wizard capable of creating immense business value blending whatever tech knowledge he had with his futuristic knowledge and user friendly knack. It worked well in business sphere most of the time but his personality was a non-stop missile like character filled with high ego and self-esteem. Add a load of arrogance and anger to that and you get a nice recipe for a very boring movie. He didn't have time for his family and we don't know what was going on actually. There was nothing interesting to create a cinematically worthwhile feature movie from Jobs character. This movie has tried to create the emotional family man that there was not, and failed miserably - obviously. It's a pretty boring two hours, not because of acting (all actors do pretty well) but mainly because there was nothing to grasp aesthetically and get connected to the movie. You feel you are left out always, not with the movie. That is the main downside of this movie. Character co-ordination is so brittle I wondered what kind of a screenplay would it looks like? Actually the previous one with Ashton Kutcher was much better depicting true Jobs character than what Fassbender did.

Unfortunately he has no nomination for the Oscar but I respect him from this film! <br/><br/>All I want to say is to go and see this film for god's sake. Please respect good films!<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>bavan"
"k-hosni","7","1","3","31 January 2016"," Fassbender perfectly captures the frustrating ego of Steve Jobs
","Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) takes us behind the scenes of a digital revolution, to paint a portrait of the man at its epicenter. The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac.<br/><br/>After watching the lackluster film ""Jobs"" with Ashton Kutcher 2 years ago, my earnest hope was that there be a better film for Steve Jobs released sometime in the future. Here it is...<br/><br/>The film consists of something similar to a three-act play where we get to see Steve Jobs backstage during the unveiling of new products at three different times of his life. Through seemingly unending shots and aggressive movements the audience genuinely feels like they're in Job's presence.<br/><br/>In these three parts of the film, we get to witness Jobs in three different times of his life from being a company founder of the flourishing Apple Computers during the release of the Macintosh in 1984; a fired Apple employee who just started a new lackluster NeXT company during the release of the Cube in 1988; and finally a leader of a resurging Apple company during the release of the iMac in 1998.<br/><br/>Each shot looked beautiful with stunning cinematography and lighting. Although Danny Boyle directed this amazing biopic, the true orchestrator of the film was Aaron Sorkin, who once again delivers a powerful and engaging screenplay. This film is one powerful ride.<br/><br/>Fassbender leaps off the screen in the first two minutes and never lets go. He looks nothing like Jobs but he perfectly captures the frustrating ego that everyone loathed and matches it with high spirit and some humor. Seth Rogan gives the single best dramatic performance of his career. Kate Winslet was stunning as always but I don't think this is an Oscar worthy moment for her.<br/><br/>A plus: I thought it was clever teasing the audience with the Alan Turing theory behind apple branding. Alan Turing, the gay inventor of the computer, found dead from cyanide poisoning with a half-eaten apple by the side of his bed. Is it significant that Steve Jobs, the re-inventor of the computer, chose that very object as his company logo, complete with a fateful missing bite 22 years later?"
"estebangonzalez10","8","1","3","22 January 2016"," Aaron Sorkin, the true orchestrator of this powerful film
","""Musicians play their instruments. I play the orchestra.""<br/><br/>Danny Boyle might have been the director of this biopic, but the true orchestrator of the film was Aaron Sorkin who once again delivers a powerful and engaging screenplay that makes the entire cast look fantastic. There is no denying the genius of Jobs, but it is so hard to encapsulate an entire life into a two hour film (several attempts have been made but failed to do so until now), but Sorkin masterfully pulls it off by focusing the film in three stages; each one involving a product launch. The first act takes place in 1984 during the launch of the Macintosh computer. Here we are introduced to Jobs's vision and his stormy relationship with his co-workers as well as with the mother of his daughter who he refuses to recognize. Jobs is an intriguing man with a unique vision who can't seem to balance his personal relationships with his creative genius. Through witty dialogues and fantastic character interactions we get a glimpse of who this man is. The second stage takes place after Jobs has been fired from the company he co-founded, for the launch of his new creation: NeXT in 1988. And the final third act is where he is finally consecrated as a genius during the launch of the IMac computer after having been called back to save the almost bankrupt company.<br/><br/>The performances are fantastic, but you couldn't expect less from such a rich script. Michael Fassbender is superb as Jobs. He delivers an outstanding performance of such an iconic public figure. But the rest of the cast never falls behind. Kate Winslet plays his head of marketing, Joanna Hoffman, who is brilliant and shines in every scene she shares with Fassbender. Apple's CEO, John Scully is interpreted by Jeff Daniels, and there is a fantastic parallel scene where he and Jobs go off at each other during two specific moments that changed their relationship. Then there is another powerful scene where Jobs and Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) have a disputed argument where they finally let all their feelings out in the open. Every character in this film has his or her moment and each one is key to unraveling who Jobs was and how he thought. The film is perfectly written and I don't think anyone will take the Oscar away from Sorkin."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","3","15 December 2015"," A well-made three-act play . . .
","There was a time when, upon leaving the house, I never walked out without my wallet and my keys. After the revolution of Steve Jobs, it grew to include my iPod which contains not only my music but also podcasts, lectures, documentaries and anything else that makes the drollery of my drive to work into an intellectual awakening. Yes, Jobs changed the world, and personally changed my world – and, admit it, he personally changed your world too. He wanted to free our computers from the confines of the wall socket, and make them smaller, faster and portable. Far from the paranoia of the HAL 9000, he wanted to make the future an inviting and warm place technologically, to push the future forward and make us see our portable devices as a friend. He understood what it took to make us happy. He was the master of supply and demand, supplying a demand for a product that we didn't even know that we wanted yet.<br/><br/>Ever since he passed away four years ago, biographers have been trying to pin down this man who bore the appearance of a wise, friendly showman on stage, a man whose innovations and beautiful mind put him in the same ranks as Edison, Tesla, Bell, Da Vinci, and The Wright Brothers. Yet, like Edison, he had a cold and bitter manner. It was said that he could be officious, dismissive and even cruel. That's the image that biographers are trying to wrap their heads around, the man who wanted the public to see their devices as a friend had few warm human interactions with those in his inner circle.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle's bio-pic Steve Jobs probably comes as close as anyone is likely to get with a storytelling narrative to who Jobs was personally. If you want a story closer to the bone, watch the documentary Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine from earlier this year. It intended to break apart Jobs' cult of personality and find out what made him tick. Steve Jobs does the same thing, and maybe has a much more cold-blooded vantage point. It was tempting to want to soften his image, to give Jobs a reverent quality of a genius who simply out-guessed and out-thought those around him. Yet, while Danny Boyle's biopic does what it can to celebrate his genius, it never shies away from making him look like a schmuck, which if you believe his underlings, it not that far from the truth (I can believe it since Wozniak was a consultant on the movie).<br/><br/>That's the key to the movie. It never backs away from the cold, bitterness of Steve Jobs. As played in a wonderful performance Michael Fassbender, we are introduced to a man who is driven beyond all reason to make a product that will change the world, but it is not without cost. He's cold and mean to those around him. He argues every minute detail – the movie opens as he is berating his chief architect Andy Herzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) to get Mac to say ""Hello"" five minutes before it is due to be unveiled. Meanwhile backstage he denies the parentage of his 8 year-old daughter Lisa whom he doesn't even acknowledge until he sees her working on Mac Paint. She's a prodigy, much like her old man. Lisa is played in three wonderful performances by three different actresses who imbue Lisa with a kind of wise-beyond-her-years intelligence. Who wouldn't want a daughter like this? Jobs' prickly relationship with Lisa extends to all around him. Aaron Sorkin's script is wall-to-wall with words as Jobs tries to push his vision forward at the expense of personal relationships. In board rooms, in hallways, in stairwells, he gets into it with colleagues, with is long-suffering marketing executive Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet); former Apple CEO John Scully (Jeff Daniels); and most importantly his best friend Steve Wozniak, played in a surprisingly touching performance by Seth Rogan.<br/><br/>The wordiness of the script is off-set by Danny Boyle's visual style. We find ourselves in a heated conversation between Jobs and his collaborators that take place in the present but the movie will suddenly cut back to an earlier conversation from a few years before so that what was said then builds the suspense and surprise of what is said now. It makes the wordy script more than just conversation; it turns it into an exciting narrative. Boyle also makes the effort to make the three different eras – 1984, 1988 and 1998 – all look different by shooting first in 16mm then in 35mm and then in digital so that we mentally know which time period we're in.<br/><br/>But all the filmmaking skill doesn't override the human element. Jobs is an extremely difficult man to warm up to. Watching his interactions with those around him we are challenged to wonder if he was a misunderstood genius or an egotistical narcissist who took more interest in computer chips than human relations. Michael Fassbender is really the reason to see this movie. He's wonderful actor who is best at playing complicated and often distant men – everyone from the slave owner in 12 Years a Slave to the sex addict in Shame, to the god-like Magneto in the X-Men prequels. We are challenged with how we feel about Steve Jobs, here. We can't possibly like how he treats his colleagues or his daughter, but we feel for him because he understands the he is a flawed man. He admits to Lisa that he is a damaged product, seeing himself as an operating system that he himself can't fix. The fact that he recognized that flaw may have been his best innovation."
"khang_tran","9","1","3","10 December 2015"," Aaron Sorkin at its best in worthy tribute to Steve Jobs
","Danny Boyle's biopic/character study of the late Steve Jobs is an unconventional but also refreshing take on the Apple CEO's story. As numerous feature films and documentaries have already been released, telling practically the same story, this distinct 3-act film gives an original perspective. <br/><br/>It focuses on three separate key product launches in Jobs' early career and gives a behind-the-scenes look at him interacting with employers, employees and old friends in preparing the epic presentations he's most known for. However, the core story is Job's relationship with his daughter, which exposes his character arc the best throughout the film. Something this movie could've used more of.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender stars as the main character and gives a powerhouse performance in this movie. He may not resemble Jobs physically, but more than makes up for it in embodying his drive, intensity and personality. His intensity is matched by Kate Winslet, playing his ""work-wife"" Joanna, and Jeff Daniels as John Sculley. Watching them act alongside each other is a sight to see. Expect some Oscar recognition the coming award season. Honorable mention to Seth Rogen, who gives an excellent dramatic performance as Apple co- founder Steve Wozniak.<br/><br/>Yet, the person who steals the show is Aaron Sorkin, who delivers a dynamite screenplay with witty and intriguing dialogue. His script sets the pace for the whole movie and time really flies when watching the actors excellently deliver his lines. <br/><br/>The pace and intensity of the conversations were nicely maintained with long track shots and tight editing. I also appreciated the directors' decision to film the 3 parts in 16mm, 35mm and digital to give a nice feel of the time span of the movie.<br/><br/>A slight point of criticism could be that some of the flashback scenes might have been cut differently for a more dramatic effect or a smoother transition of the scene. <br/><br/>All in all, Steve Jobs is an incredibly entertaining film with a killer script, fantastic acting and gives us a nuanced perspective on Steve Jobs. Not only picturing him as an intolerable jerk, but as a flawed man who had trouble connecting with the people he cared for. Something he himself was very aware of. Therefore, the movie really delivers on its tagline: Can a great man be a good man?"
"rjsf96","10","1","3","25 November 2015"," Jobs Version 2.0
","It's practically impossible to review Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs without bringing up The Social Network. They are not exactly identical subjects. Yet they bear certain inescapable similarities. Both about an egotistical loner, outside of regular society and so devoted to creating the next big thing that they do not care whom they hurt in the process. Steve Jobs is not the better film of the two and yet it's not far behind either.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs is the co-founder of Apple. To say he is demanding of his staff would be a severe understatement. He expects everything from them and if they fail to live up to his colossal expectations he threatens them with public humiliation at the very least. The film is divided into three well defined acts. The first starts in 1984, the launch of the failed Apple Macintosh. The second in 1988, the NeXT computer and finally the iMac in 1998 this acts as somewhat of a rebirth for the talented Steve Jobs. <br/><br/>Danny Boyle centres these three acts primarily upon the conflicts that Jobs has with his family; namely his former girlfriend Chrisann Brennan and Lisa his daughter that he does not acknowledge as his own child for some time. These confrontations give Steve Jobs a dramatic centre and heart. It helps us identify with the character even when he makes things exceedingly difficult for the people that work around him. <br/><br/>However, this sudden shift in timelines does add a disorientating effect that the film could do without. The time jump from 1984 to 1988 is largely inconsequential and works well. It allows us time to see the growth of the characters and their maturity likewise increases. Or in the case of Jobs his arrogance and egotistical side takes over and is more readily apparent than before. But the time gap from 1988 to 1998 does indeed hurt the film from a dramatic standpoint. Any drama built up from the strongly constructed first two acts bears little meaning or resemblance to speak of in the third. It still has drama and by any means is not a bad way to end the film. It just renders everything that came before almost meaningless, almost.<br/><br/>Whenever the film gets bogged down in these details it springs gracefully back up and snaps into shape. You cannot deny the sheer power of the film. This emanates through every line of Aaron Sorkin's memorable dialogue. The script is many things and is surely smart, swift and engaging until the very end. It is not as witty as The Social Network but it matches it for intellect and ingenuity. Because of the break ups in acts it never maintains the flow and focus of David Fincher's masterpiece, but it is still writing at its most uniformly excellent. If every script in Hollywood was up to the level of quality that Sorkin's is then each film that came out would be a must see for every audience member across the world. Despite its shortcomings, Danny Boyle's latest is just that; a film that demands to be seen by anyone who can appreciate spectacular writing and directing on any level.<br/><br/>Boyle's directing is stunning and does not take center stage like before. He lets the real stars of the show shine brightest like writer Aaron Sorkin and the actors that soar at every opportunity that they are given to do so. Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs is a masterstroke. No matter how many times he is threatening or forceful to his members of loyal staff we still care about his troubles, worries and doubts. There is a sadness that is aching deep inside him; we only see this more vulnerable side of his personality in the time that he spends alone with his daughter Lisa.<br/><br/>But the real breakthrough here is Seth Rogen. Not exactly the kind of person I thought capable of delivering a thought provoking character performance steeped in nuance, but there you have it. If it was not for Michael Fassbender on top form he would steal the show. As Steve Wozniak creator of the Apple II he is the most sympathetic character of the bunch. Yet he never demands it. He just embraces the role with grace and comes out victorious. Rogen, I plead you to stop making stoner comedies. They are beneath you, please only make films where you can shine with the material that is given to you!<br/><br/>Steve Jobs is a highly entertaining, intellectual and thoughtful piece of cinema. It combines Danny Boyle, Aaron Sorkin and Michael Fassbender in a near masterpiece of modern cinema for any adult audience member. It demands to be seen, not just once, but twice. Hollywood is all too lacking when it comes to films crafted with this complexity, ingenuity and script smarts."

","This is the 2nd Steve Jobs movie this year, (the first being a documentary film) and the fourth feature film about Steve Jobs. I'm sure many people are wondering, do we really need another Steve Jobs movie? Well I can tell you that after this one we sure don't.<br/><br/>Unlike your typical biopic, this movie takes place during three specific events in the life of Jobs: the launch of the Macintosh in 1984, the launch of NeXT in 1988 and the launch of the Mac in 1998. Some flashbacks do interlace with the launches but the flashbacks are very brief. If you're looking for a movie that examines the entire life of Jobs then you won't find that here. <br/><br/>The three acts format really make the movie unique and unlike any other kind of biopic, we see Jobs grow from an angry almost-dictator of a man to one who grows to care about his family, and us caring about him comes from Michael Fassbender's excellent job at portraying Steve. He might not look anything like him but he sure knocks Ashton Kutcher out of the park. I'm 90% sure his role as Jobs will be nominated for an Oscar.<br/><br/>In fact pretty much everyone in this movie does a great job, even the child actor who played Jobs' daughter did a good job. But seeing as how the three acts of the movie each take before a product launch it does seem a bit strange that they all show up to talk to him. It seems that everyone that Jobs knows shows up during the three acts. It's strange. <br/><br/>The movie is also beautifully shot. As the movie progresses throughout the three acts it progresses from 16mm film, 35mm film and finally digital. It's meant to show technological advancement and it works, the film looks crisp and sharp.<br/><br/>But alas this isn't a movie that's for everyone. The movie is entirely dialogue driven and it almost surely thinks that the audience has knowledge of the inner workings of a computer seeing as how many arguments within the movie (and trust me, there's a LOT of them) are entirely about the different types of tech used in a computer. Unless you know your computers, you're going to be lost when watching these scenes. Simply put the movie doesn't hold your hand and explain everything to you.<br/><br/>But it would help if it did. Multiple events in the career of Jobs and the history of Apple are also referred to in passing throughout the movie and (once again) unless you know your history, you'll be confused at these references. I wouldn't usually recommend a terrible movie but in this case I recommend watching the Ashton Kutcher Steve Jobs movie before watching this one as it shows multiple events that are referenced to in this movie.<br/><br/>Arguments make up a good deal of this movie, I'd say about 95% of it and they work at capturing your attention. My favorite scenes in the movie where the ones where Steve is arguing with his ex-girlfriend over his daughter and financial issues. <br/><br/>Overall, Steve Jobs is a finely crafted movie. The acting is great, cinematography is sharp, the story is even better. Definitely an Oscar contender. The movie is barely 2 hours long but I feel like it could have covered a bit more. Most biopics are around 2 and a half hours long anyways so I feel like the movie could have shown us a bit more of Steve's life. <br/><br/>I'm going to give Steve Jobs a B+"
"jmoneyjohal","8","1","3","23 October 2015"," Steve Jobs is a inspiring and moving tale, about the growth of a man and his company, that is told through 3 acts.
","Steven Jobs is the man who created a technological revolution, he created the device I am using to write this review, and I can almost bet that whatever device you are using too read this review is a Apple device created by Jobs. He has changed peoples lives forever, because think about it how long do spend on your iPhones,iPads, and MacBooks a day. To put it simply a lot, and therefore watching a film based on his life was very intriguing to say the least.But the film is not based on his life, the trailers, the films title eludes the viewer, instead the film is set in thee acts like a play would be,in which we get to see the growth of Apple, from failure to the heights of success. Danny Boyle, and Aaron Sorkin take a gamble that pays off, people excepted a full blown biopic, they wanted the ins and out of his life, they wanted to know how Apple was created etc. But instead we are given a insight of how Jobs and his key members of Apple grew with the failure and eventually success of Apple.The film does not get into the nitty gritty stuff, instead it talks only about Jobs's dream of making Apple into a successful path breaking company. Its was also interesting to know that Jobs was not the absolute amazing human being we thought he was, but more on that later.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs is told in three acts, in which we see the growth of Steve Jobs, and Apple. The first act is set in 1984 when Jobs introduces the MacIntosh a new apple product.The second act is set in 1988, when Jobs has been fired by Apple and is set to launch his new company computer Next. The final act is when Jobs launches the iMac, in 1998, after he returns to Apple.<br/><br/>Acting wise we see one of the best ensemble casts of the year in Steve Jobs.Micheal Fassbender is Steve Jobs, not for second do you think he is enacting a part, and he leaves you in awe with his dedication to the role.Kate Winslet is electrifying as Jobs's assistant, in the third act when she is yelling at Jobs she completely takes charge of the film.Seth Rogen underplays his role to perfection. and his final argument with Jobs in the third act after he walks away with superb panache, that scene defines his act. Jeff Daniels is superb, and at times overshadows the whole cast.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs is almost like a experimental film, with the way its presented in three acts, and with its long scenes, its something you have never on the screen before. Its almost like a theater play. And for a lot of viewers this experiment might not work, people come excepting a biopic with a lot insight into apple and Jobs. But the film instead jam packs everything into the three acts, and there a lot under currents which the viewers has to pick up, they are not spoon feed information. However Steve Jobs works because of the reason why many may stay away from the film, the three act experiment for me was really refreshing, and the way we got the the growth of Jobs through these act was completely inspiring, and different. The tension filled launches were very entertaining to see, it was almost as the viewer was there in every big move Apple made.It was also nice to see that they showed the really Jobs in his many honest shades, because obviously we know he is a great man, but we never knew that he was also selfish, sly, and so self centered.The films best part however is the growth we see between Jobs and his daughter. There relationship starts of as a fragile one but slowly we see a very heartwarming relationship emerge, and in the end reels you may even shed a tear or two.<br/><br/>Overall Steve Jobs, is a experimental film that is completely inspiring and moving, watch the film to see he rise of one the greatest entrepreneurs of the 21st century. In the end of Steve Jobs you will be left in awe, but I must say for as great as the film was, there was something still missing in the film don't know exactly what, maybe because I was excepting a biopic, but regardless its still a great film<br/><br/>4/5* or 8/10"
"vanettelstarr-163-9775","7","4","29","11 October 2015"," Don't compare...Be tolerant and give honor, he deserves, to Job's!
","I haven't seen this version, but I have watched every single one of the others, and each had something or a different view point to present. I can't say I've seen a poor version, yet, but i don't ever tune into lifetime movie channel for anything unless forced...meaning only if there are no other sources for a biography on a character, will I turn to the LMC for a biographical movie. Nonetheless, I did see the Ashton Kertchner version, and of all of them, until this new one, I thought this was the best Job's biopic film, so far. I am an Ashton fan, but when I was watching it, I didn't know it was him as the star until later, so that says a great deal about his acting skills to imitate a man so well, his person hood disappears. There was a late moment in his film, I then knew who it was...late into the movie. So, because I was such an admirer of Jobs, to want to see the next version, I will watch this one. That being said, the new Job's represented in this film, by the amazing Michael Fassbender, is a truly fantastic actor in his own right, in almost every dramatic film or series I've seen him in, and I'm sure with Danny Boyle, as Director, we shall have a nice piece of work to turn out on this film too. As i suggested earlier, try not to compare, but to find what each working group as to add to Job's life and death. It's truly an honor to have so many want to see who the man was, who changed the world as we know it, today! I am old enough to remember having to share a phone line with our neighbors, as the only way to communicate other than in person, face to face, so I am needless to say, honored to have been born in the same time period as such a brilliant man, as Steve Jobs was. Bravo, for another movie version of Jobs. Don't compare, but instead try to embrace, celebrate and be tolerant of all of the differences and each of different nuances from each of the Steve Jobs story tellers! Just like everyone in the human race, Job's had flaws, failings and his own eccentricities. He was no God, but what he did do, was no less great than Einstein, Ford, Bell, along with many others who changed our world for the better...let's remember him, flaws and all, even as we see flaws and all in each attempt to cover such a fascinating and brilliant character!"

"lucasnochez","10","1","4","3 February 2016"," Film Review: Steve Jobs
","It is often stated that the line between insanity and genius is measured only by success. When discussion turns to that of one's genius, we find it difficult not to equate that genius with some level of insanity. This is especially true when that discussion focuses on Steve Jobs, the man behind machines that allows us to hold the world in the palm of our hand. Steve Jobs is not simply a film, but is an experience of perception; of history; and of a household name.<br/><br/>When evaluating Steve Jobs the film, one has to stop and admire the genius of writer Aaron Sorkin. The Academy Award winner extends the parameters of his brilliance through a film that not only allows us an understanding of a complex mind, but accurately illustrates the torments, criticisms and neglect that shaped the man entrusted with its ownership. Based on Walter Isaacson's non- fiction memoir, Sorkin's script rockets off the tongues of the film's talented cast and grabs your attention as you dance through every nuanced conflict of Jobs' life. Daringly mimicking theatre in its three-piece act structure, the film presents the events of three major launches, and three very different pictures of Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender), in real time.<br/><br/>The first, shot in low-resolution 16mm film, set in Cupertino, California, shows a grainy and young Jobs moments before his inaugural Macintosh in 1984, days after the infamous science fiction based Apple commercial. The second, showing the recently axed Jobs, in 1988 at the historical San Francisco Opera House before his infamously disastrous NeXT cube launch in widescreen 35mm film displays a vengeful and highly orchestrated Jobs. Finally, in 1998, returning to Apple, this time as CEO, utilising high-definition digital film at San Francisco's Davies Symphony Hall, before his presentation of the iMac. The last act presents to the audience the most human yet morally flawed version of a man no one ever really understood. Each scene, running close to thirty five minutes each, is as enthralling, entertaining and orchestrated as the next.<br/><br/>Jobs has always maintained a very muddled and misguided personal life; one that includes a young daughter Lisa with a college sweetheart Christen Brennan (Katherine Waterston), very uninspiring social skills as well as a knack for being referred to as unlovable. Sorkin's script looks to answer one of the biggest questions plaguing the late great tech genius: can a great man still be a good man? Thanks to an electric script by the great Aaron Sorkin, phenomenal performances on all fronts, masterful direction and a brilliant neo-classical score by Daniel Pemberton, Steve Jobs is easily a crowning cinematic achievement and the best film of 2015, in spite of not being the most audience alluring film released this award season.<br/><br/>From the beginning, the film is a pish-posh of gossip and rumours. Not that anyone thought the film would bow down to the atrocious Ashton Kutcher vehicle Jobs in 2013, but the film did suffer a slew of ""technical difficulties"" going into production. Once in the hands of David Fincher, the film was always setup to be as great, if not greater than The Social Network. With Christian Bale initially cast, the film went through directors, stars and crew like a Daytona racetrack, eventually settling on director Danny Boyle, and stars Michael Fassbender and Daniel Pemberton instead of a roster that may very well have included Fincher, Bale, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Luckily for audiences, Steve Jobs is not an unwanted and pumped out studio biopic, and focuses less on the look of Jobs and more on the essence of a man struggling with himself more than the struggles of an economically competitive technological world.<br/><br/>While the film is presented in a very basic three act structure, there is nothing simple about the film. Driven by dialogue, its characters and three very crucial times in the life of Steve Jobs, the abstract delivery of these highly regarded singular events of the 20th century are presented with ease and class.<br/><br/>In a world where recognition is everything, and being pointed out in humiliation and failure could forever change your reputation professionally, Steve Jobs, logically speaking, had no right becoming a pioneer of technology. He was no engineer, designer or programmer, yet, the world knew his name and the ramifications of his brilliance. In one of the many powerful scenes of the film, when confronted by his cohort and early friend, Apple Co-Founder Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak (Seth Rogen) what he does. In response, Jobs says, ""I play the orchestra!"" Often times being measured next to Leonardo Da Vinci, Julius Ceasar and God himself, Jobs was often misconceived as a diabolical man with a plan, giving out the passes to whomever came in his way.<br/><br/>While many may be very discouraged to see the film, with fear that a biopic of a gifted tech guru would be overwhelmed with difficult tech-inspired lingo, the film is a well balanced feature showcasing moments of extreme drama, emotion and heart. Many of these scenes are anchored with Jobs by himself, the women in his life, father figure and late CEO of Apple John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) and friends. The emotions in the film hold together the very fine strains of intensity and drive the white-knuckled pace of the film overall.<br/><br/>Holding the very intimate moments of the film are the women in Steve Jobs; an old flame Chrisann, his daughter Lisa (played by Makenzie Moss at 5, Ripley Sobo at 9, and Perla Haney-Jardine at age 19) and the only person who ever stands up to Jobs, Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet). Sorkin, who has more than enough substance with his male leads, uses the women in Jobs' life to draw out the kinks in the suit of amour Jobs so easily shows us, dealing with simple issues of patriarchy, ego, and image."
"RforFilm","10","1","4","29 January 2016"," Like the beautifully designed Apple products, Steve Jobs is a fascinating look into the man behind the Macs.
","Today is the greatest day as we have the advantage of having computers within the hands of anyone. This was the ideology of the late Apple creator, Steve Jobs. It was the goal of Jobs to take the technology of computers, a type of machine that only a few people knew how to work, and find a way to give it to the people. He was smart in realizing the true potential of the electronic machine and what people would do with it. He saw as the modern canvas that could turn the everyday Joe into an artist. To quote him again, ""It's not about putting it in the right hands, but in everybody's hands"".<br/><br/>We already had an independently produced story with Jobs (which I got to play a small part) that most people found too standard in biography stories and not up to the high quality of the real Steve Jobs and Apple. What was really desired was an adaptation of the Walter Isaacson biography of Steve Jobs. I agree that it's a fantastic book, but the book required a unique look at the man behind Apple. Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours) plugged in for his crack at the original Apple genius in Steve Jobs. <br/><br/>Rather then to adapt the entire life story (I don't even know if that's doable in film format), the movie takes a perspective by exploring three different product launches. <br/><br/>We first begin in 1984 where after the successful ""1984"" ad had caught a lot of attention, Steve Jobs (played by Michael Fassbender) is trying to make sure that the launch of the Macintosh goes smoothly. Besides getting his fellow engineer Andy Hertzfeld (played by Michael Stuhlbarg), he's also juggling the decisions of the old Apple 2 computer of fellow Apple creator Steve Wozniak (played by Seth Rogan), the newly hired CEO John Sculley (played by Jeff Daniels) and his relationship with an ex-girlfriend and their daughter Lisa.<br/><br/>While all these people seem to have a hard time getting through the stubborn ""conductor of computer engineers"", marketing executive Joanna Hoffman (played by Kate Winslet) is the only one that's willing to challenge Jobs on his choices and behavior. She's the one who tries to get through to him on treating his friends better and to acknowledge his daughter. We also explore Steve Jobs at the unavailing of his NeXT computer in 1988 and of the iMac in 1998. <br/><br/>As I mentioned before, Steve Jobs had to go further then the typical biography. Only focusing his story on three events might seem like a major gamble, but the script of Aaron Sorkin allows you to really get to know the Apple genius. Danny Boyle seemed to have never been afraid to portray him as arrogant and pretentious. Steve Jobs is a fine example of a character study where you, the audience is suppose to decide on whether he was a good man. It's structure allows for several layers to unfold. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Boyle took a lot of inspiration from Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>Honestly, the casting is near perfect. Michael Fassbender was someone that I'd thought would stick out, but he looses himself within Steve Jobs and there were times I forgot I was watching a movie. Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels, Michael Stuhlbarg are all casted perfectly within their roles as well, though the one really tying them all is Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman. <br/><br/>What may surprise most people is that Steve Jobs feels like a small movie as most of the film takes place within theaters on the product launches. It honestly feels like an excellent play that I'm sure will get it's own adaptation in some form.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten Macintoshes' out of ten. Some people are builders and some are idea people. Steve Jobs was an idea guy that knew how to lead. Even if his attitude was questionable, I'm sure you'll draw your own conclusions on how far one goes to change the world. Steve Jobs is like an awesome Apple product that everyone should touch at one point."
"luca-103","7","1","4","1 January 2016"," The Hateful One
","The Hateful One ... the man depicted in ""Jobs"" the movie is definitely dark enough for a Tarantino's schlock fest but with vastly better dialogue. I would re- title this one ""Steve Shrugged"". <br/><br/>""You are a good musician, but I play the orchestra,"" the character boasts at one point. His genius , after all was for envisioning and bringing into life new high-value closed systems -- Apple vs MS-DOS, i-Tunes vs RealAudio -- within which he could play consumers and content providers alike like a fiddle. <br/><br/>In internet terms, Jobs' ideal of an end-to-end closed system is the ""Cain"" to Tim Berners-Lee's ""Abel"", the infinitely open and enabling World Wide Web. So it feels absolutely right that Danny Boyle, the director who made Berners-Lee a star of his London Olympics presentation was the one to finish (and pass) the sentence. <br/><br/>Comic Jake Whitehall recently quipped that hoped this would be the last Steve Jobs movie for some time: ""they keep bringing out another one, a bit better but far more expensive than the previous one ... but I guess that is the way Steve liked it"".<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly excellent, the Sorkin dialogue does not disappoint and the narrative is well handled by Boyle. It is not an easy watch, and it will not be a popular watch, given the absurd scale of the Steve Jobs myth. But it is a compelling, uncompromising and beautifully crafted product ... ""just the way Steve would have liked it""."
"droopyherby","5","1","4","11 November 2015"," Five Arguments In Search Of A Plot
","I thought the film was incredibly well acted - Fassbender, Winslet, Rogan, Daniels & Shultbarg are excellent. My problem with the movie was it was basically the same arguments over and over in five different scenes. I enjoy Danny Boyle's films very much & admire how eclectic he has been - everything from Shallow Grave to Slumdog Millionaire - but here the film is almost like a theatre piece - just tons of talking backstage and in dressing rooms. Sorkin can be good - Moneyball & Social Network but he can also be precious - Sports Night & Newsroom. I don't know what he'd do if he couldn't have a neurotic female character hold a clipboard of some sorts! Winslet does it here, Mortimer on Newsroom, the female lead on Sports Night, etc. It just seems a staple & Winslet & Fassbender are amazing in the first scene, but after that, everyone seems to have the SAME argument again and again till the end credits roll - Jobs can't admit he's wrong, Jobs refuses to mention the Apple 2 team, Jobs argues with his ex-girlfriend on whether he's the father of her kid, Jobs argues with his mentor/boss, it's all witty & sharp but because of the repetition, it just becomes white noise. And hollow. It all seemed forced that ALL this interpersonal drama and emotional blood letting went on JUST before almost EVERY single launch he ever gave."
"kunalkhandwala","7","1","4","9 November 2015"," Riveting performances in a one-dimensional screenplay
","Minutes before the launch of the Macintosh back in 1984, Jobs is agitated by the designer's inability to make the device say Hello. That unwarranted obsession in reality, was his passionate vision that became the legacy of the iCEO. Walter Isaacson captured the essence of the genius entrepreneur's journey from his garage up until his last days after the introduction of the Ipad 2. However, the adaptation by Andy Sorkin restricts our insight into the character and his legacy as it focuses more on his struggles as a reluctant father and as a failed CEO. Danny Boyle ('Slumdog Millionaire', '127 hours') had to extract the best out of Michael Fassbender and the supporting actors to capture our attention in this one- dimensional biography and with some sharp dialogues, they do have a riveting effect.<br/><br/>The first among the three product launches in the film's narrative centers around the Macintosh and more importantly, Jobs' interaction with Chrisann (Katherine Waterston) and their daughter Lisa, whom he refuses to acknowledge as his own. Jobs' nonchalant and unkind mannerism towards his daughter makes complete sense when he is portrayed as a prick with the Apple team. Sorkin unabashedly focuses our attention to this side of Steve Jobs and offers little insight into the reason behind such behaviors. Adopted at an early age after being abandoned by his birth parents, Jobs' acrimony pretty much takes over the entire film's narrative. The first act also portrays his persistence for achieving the details that wouldn't really matter to the end user but they are primal in his vision. Just when Jobs was to appear on stage to unveil the Macintosh to the crowd, the director jumps to highlight the product's dismal sales performance that eventually led to Apple firing its very co-founder. Four years later, Jobs' interaction with Lisa about the perfect cube and her mother's negligent parenting is interrupted by Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), prompting him to prepare for a couple of meetings before he gets on stage to launch the ridiculously overpriced, NeXT Cube. In a heated scene, Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) warns him of the Cube's imminent failure due to its price and market, to which, Jobs pays little heed. Product aesthetics and end-to-end control were at the core of his products while Woz tried to alter his ways to make products successful by making them more changeable. If this argument was heated, then the five minutes with the 'Newsroom' star Jeff Daniels who plays Apple CEO John Sculley, is simply screen-scorching. One man tries to justify why he did what he had to while the other looks for closure from his past failure. His moments with a very concerned Joanna, reveal his broad intentions and astute business mind. The screenplay then jumps to the epic failure of the product that was renowned in the computing industry for years to come. Having been re-hired as then struggling Apple's CEO in 1998, Jobs is about to get on stage to unveil the industry shaking iMac but he must first confront Woz yet again and a grown up Lisa who now shares a much stronger bond with her father. The film closes on the triumphant turning point that would mark new beginnings for Jobs' career as an innovative CEO and for his bond with the daughter he has finally come to acknowledge.<br/><br/>The iMac went on to become hugely successful and it laid the foundation for Apple Computers which then became the hub for industry changing innovations. Sadly, this tip of the iceberg is all that the film showcases about the iconic thinker and his company's successes. Sorkin and Danny Boyle take their creative liberties to not only dramatize the failures of Steve Jobs but also digress from Isaacson's book to lean into the one- dimensional portrayal of the struggling father, failed CEO and ungrateful friend. Such deviations and liberties are acceptable in biopics that don't have two hours of exciting material but ending the story about Steve Jobs back in 1998, just when the world started recognizing his true genius, is risky and honestly unfulfilling. Steve Jobs may have been a prick with his social skills but his intention was only to pursue the unthinkable and achieve the extraordinary with his team. Only the thick skinned folk around him survived his lashing and they turned out to be the successors of his legacy of crowd pleasing innovation.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender is genuinely, the film's stronghold. His performance is fierce in its sincerity to the portrayal, his understanding of Steve Jobs' passion behind innovating is depicted with the persistence that comes from a mature actor. He is quite straightforward being acrimonious and he makes it look totally normal. This should, at the very least, earn Fassbender a nomination for the best actor. Jeff Daniels comes to his best in the heated confrontation with Fassbender and the scene just electrifies with intensity. Seth Rogen is mostly himself but his disbelief of Jobs' stubbornness is what he plays all along while being supportive to his friend. Michael Stuhlbarg as Andy Hartzfeld portrays the recipient of Steve Jobs' lashing that result from his obsessive innovation standards. Kate Winslet balances the tension, frustration and precarious nature of her CEO but being bold enough to challenge him especially when it concerns his daughter Lisa. As Hoffman, she stands out as a tough woman in business and more so by her well maintained composure.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle's captivating direction includes a variety of filters, lighting and close ups. Andy Sorkin's screenplay shows us his perspective of Steve Jobs which isn't completely fulfilling for those who would've preferred a complete insight into the character. However, the film is a riveting watch because of the powerhouse of performances especially from Michael Fassbender. This may not be the last film about the world's most talked about tech innovator and CEO and it very well shouldn't be.<br/><br/><ul><li>7.681 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"Yelitza-screenwriting-student","7","1","4","25 October 2015"," Ebullient performance: just a man, but an orchestrator of genius
","Fassbender is ebullient! The outpouring of energy is constant throughout the film. But most of the energy flows through dialogue. Sometimes it gets a bit boring because of all the talking and bickering. But at midpoint the film gains momentum and gets a bit exciting. Those who admired Birdman might also like Steve Jobs. But there is no magical realism :it's a ""matter-of-fact"" story.<br/><br/>The writing and Fassbender's performance capture the spirit of Steve Jobs: A man with a dream – fighting against whoever and whatever to get it fulfilled. Along the way he makes enemies. He makes friends. The film focuses on a specific period of time of his life—here we empathize with this character because he shows his human side. Surely he is a genius, but he has vulnerabilities and anxieties: his poor relationship with his daughter, his daughter's mother, some friends, and with himself. <br/><br/>I loved the ""real time"" filming style, feels a lot like Birdman (Oscar winning director and screenwriter Alejandro G. Iñárritu) – the camera tracking behind the actors for a this-moment-right-now feeling. Fantastic. Also, Birdman was filmed backstage and staged in a theater, sort of what Sorkin did with Steve Jobs film – it revolved around two major Apple media release events. Sorkin is the star screenplay writer of two of my favorite films: A Few Good Men and Social Network. <br/><br/>Winslet is the loyal assistant, who knows him and cares for him. I think in the film she also represents Steve Job's sister—who in real life was the person that influenced him to heal his relationship with his out-of-wedlock daughter. <br/><br/>And of course the rest of the cast is wonderful—thanks to their great acting they make all the events feel so real, and they bring the best and the worst in our protagonist. <br/><br/>Although boring at times, overall this film is absorbing, entertaining and heartwarming. You will walk out of the film inspired and having admiration for the man Steve Jobs, and feeling emotional connection because he had flaws and problems just like any one of us. Although the flashbacks add a dynamic element that break the monotony of the film, sometimes feels confusing. <br/><br/>Excellent bio-drama to watch at least once! Cheers."
"ryanmark-57919","7","1","4","25 October 2015"," Not a Traditional Biopic but Still Very Good
","This movie was different from what I thought it was going to be but it's still very interesting. Basically the whole movie is Steve Jobs ( if you don't know who he is then go Google the name but I'm going to assume you all haven't been living under a rock) having conversations with people before important reveals of his products. I have serious doubts about how accurate these events are simply because of how perfect it would be for all this drama to happen in this way but it's still very well done drama. Aaron Sorkin's script is pretty good and Danny Boyle always makes something interesting to see. It's certainly better than that other Steve Jobs movie. Let's get to the story.<br/><br/>The plot follows Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) as he prepares himself before going onstage for three different product reveals: the original Macintosh in 1984, the Next in 1988, and the iMac in 1998. His life is radically different in each of these time periods but the story follows his relationship with the same group of people throughout the years. The main gist of what's happening is that Jobs has quite a few problems with his personal life and his business relations that make things more complicated than they really need to be. This is because Jobs is kind of a prick. Well, he's not kind of a prick he's more like a full blown asshole. Still, he has some interesting ideas.<br/><br/>Another film with a stellar cast, there just seems to be a lot of excellent actors working today. Fassbender plays the sometimes likable but often confrontational Steve Jobs. I really enjoyed Fassbender's portrayal simply because of his ability to be likable and completely standoffish at the same time. I've heard stories that Steve Jobs was sometimes hard to work with but I can't help but wonder if they went a little overboard here. Still, Fassbender did an excellent job. Kate Winslet does an excellent job as Joanna Hoffman, one of the executives at Apple and Jobs' confidant. She plays well off of Fassbender. I love that she doesn't put up with any crap while all the others have so much trouble with Jobs.<br/><br/>The other five characters that Jobs interacts with are Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen), John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg), Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston), and Lisa Brennan (Makenzie Moss, Ripley Sobo, and Perla Haney-Jardine). Honestly, I don't think there's a weak link in any of these actors and actresses. They all do an excellent job and it's actually a tall order for me to say that about child actors. I don't want to go into too much of these characters' motivations since I feel like that would give away a bit much of the plot but they do a great job and I just wanted to give them a mention. The whole movie basically centers around conversations with these characters.<br/><br/>So, the whole movie centers around conversations a small set of people which means this isn't exactly a biopic in the traditional sense of the term. We don't really see how Jobs gets into the industry or anything like that. We see the occasional flashback but the film hinges on the interactions between Jobs and those around him. I believe that the movie was trying to portray an obviously flawed individual that had an enormous impact on our everyday lives and our very history. The philosophy this man followed caused trouble to those around him but it changed the very way we interact with the world. Unfortunately, he wasn't at all easy to deal with. The movie shows us his personal attitude and the impact he had on others through his interactions with a group of less than ten characters. There is a passage of time in the film but fifteen years is relatively short for a biopic. I believe Boyle wanted us to see what kind of man he was rather than give a full rundown of his life.<br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect but I thought it was still pretty good. There are a few parts that made me roll my eyes. I won't spoil it but Jobs makes references to ideas for items that we have in the future but didn't exist back then. I know Jobs was ahead of his time but I find it hard to believes that he was responsible for every good idea that came out of Apple. Like I said, the film is pretty good but don't go in expecting an incredibly accurate and detailed telling of the life of Steve Jobs. If you like dramatic conversations that reveal insight into the characters then I believe this movie should entertain you for a while."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","4","25 October 2015"," Excellent acting, fantastic writing, clever experiment
","Electrifying and riveting. Those are really the two words that encapsulate the film the best. I had heard about a three-act structure but I wasn't aware that it would be what it was. I found it clever and highly engrossing, and lent itself very well to Sorkin's style of writing. I have heard much about how Michael Fassbender's performance isn't the type to win. Yes and no. I think in terms of pure effectiveness, it was an immensely successful, fantastic performance. He really inhabited that character upside down. In terms of showiness? It's not particularly showy, and it's also not some transformation. I can definitely see it not being enough for some people, but what else did people expect? Kate Winslet's role is also not very showy in terms of it being too meaty, but she has a lot of screen time and she injects the film with its heart. <br/><br/>I thought the script was particularly strong, but I felt like some of the directorial choices at times felt a little off. The editing at times would feel disjointed and awkward. It wasn't ever any significant problem, but I do see why some think the script is the star and not Boyle. Luckily for the most part he doesn't inject it with too much flash like he has for the rest of his filmography, and at times when he does it works, but a few times it doesn't. For example, deciding to have that loud, bombastic musical score playing during the climactic Jeff Daniels/Fassbender scene in Act 2 was a mistake. The writing of it was entirely fine for what it was, but the music really made it feel sort of like a parody at times. But I also do see it as the filmmakers showing exactly how dramatic these stakes are for these characters and also making fun of that world a bit, but if so, doesn't really fit.<br/><br/>One problem I did have was that the ending was resolved way too quickly, and it seemed way too convenient. It felt like it wad decided to just not end in a bad note, and to give Jobs his humanity back. I don't think a ""happy ending"" was needed for this at all, and regardless of how it happened in real life, it just didn't entirely click for me. Any others thoughts?<br/><br/>Overall though, highly satisfying piece of filmmaking, very entertaining, fantastic work from the ensemble and from Sorkin."
"Hunter_Logan","9","1","4","24 October 2015"," Intense, impeccably crafted, and beautifully human - an innovation in film
","This film kept me in constant awe. It proceeds in its beautifully unorthodox structure at an intense, roller-coaster-like speed, but still somehow manages an in-depth, delicate, revealing character study of its protagonist. You never once feel like you're watching ""another Steve Jobs biopic,"" instead you feel like you are being shown an exclusive look inside his complicated mind. And what's great is that the film never pretends that it knows exactly what made the man tick, but rather presents the viewer with the flawed emotions of a refreshingly human character whose eccentricities cannot be defined in the confines of a two hour film.<br/><br/>The craftsmanship is astonishing. Sorkin's script is easily the best of the year, and very well could be one of the most daring screenplays of all time. Fassbender's acting will be remembered as one of the greatest performances of the decade. It doesn't matter that he doesn't bear a striking resemblance to his subject - he loses himself in the role impeccably, and accomplishes an astonishingly polished and emotional performance. The soundtrack is superb and utilized perfectly, and everything from the understated cinematography to the expert editing is done with the utmost precision and skill. It is a film that will stick with you long after it cuts to black. You will sit in silence and contemplate what you just witnessed, because you're sure that it was a historical innovation in film. I cannot describe exactly what made ""Steve Jobs"" so amazing. All I can tell you is that you must see this film, because it redefines what a film can be."
"davecasty","6","1","4","23 October 2015"," The formula for a monumental film leaves a bad taste in my mouth
","More than most, I really wanted to like this film and place it in the cosmos as a classic. After reading the book twice, I highly anticipated this film and thought 'finally, a film to truly capture the essence of the book and Steve Job's story."" In short, I was deceived, even if there was some self-deception. <br/><br/>You're probably saying to yourself, what's not to like: The cinematography is brilliant and uncanny The acting is superb and trans-formative. You couldn't have asked more from Michael Fassbender or Kate Winslet. The editing is seamless and artful The dialog is captivating<br/><br/>So, what's the issue? The issue is this: The whole tempo of this movie plays out like a tall-tale that is a bit heavy on romanticism and dramatization. The historical inaccuracies are staggering. It all feels like a cheap trick; a branding scheme to write a script that uses legendary names to tell a fabricated story. They use the Steve Jobs name, products, characters and even historical events yet it's just a stage or theme to tell a fictional, floaty and artful story. My inner nerd is left stunned, unsatisfied and a bit angry in my disappointment. Further, its not just the fictional undertones that leave me staggered but also the gaps in the story that don't even remotely touch the feats of Job's accomplishments. This film is more about Jobs' relationships or lack there of and not really at all about the blood, sweat and tears that went into making Apple products. <br/><br/>If you read the book, I suggest you do yourself a favor and wait for the next iteration."

"rockypeterson-14223","9","1","5","22 November 2015"," ""Didn't we just see this movie two years ago, with Ashton Kutcher?"" No.
","""Didn't we just see this movie two years ago, with Ashton Kutcher?"" That's the question I've heard from a lot of people regarding this movie, and the answer is absolutely not. All this movie shares is the subject matter. Saying that is like answering an offer to go see the new James Bond movie with ""But didn't we already see this movie earlier this year, with Tom Cruise?"" Just because two movies are about the same thing, does not mean they're the same movie, ESPECIALLY in this case. Roger Ebert used to say ""A movie isn't about what it's about, it's about how it's about it,"" and when I see movies like Steve Jobs, I understand what he meant. <br/><br/>But still, as much as I'd love to get angry that this movie bombed, I completely understand why it did. The only negative thing you'll probably hear me say about this movie in this review is that it was extremely poorly timed. Because really, who cares about Steve Jobs anymore? Nobody does. Everybody knows Steve Jobs was a huge douche, everybody knows that he changed the world in a big way. Everyone gets that. That's why this movie bombed, and that's why if my desperate attempt to persuade you to go see it succeeds, you'll probably have to waste a lot of gas to do so, since it's been pulled from about 2,000 screens across the country. I'm not angry at the movie-going populace for causing this to happen, like I am when Transformers 36 grosses half a billion dollars. All I feel is pity, because they're missing out on one of the best movies of the decade so far. <br/><br/>Rather than taking the staple biopic approach of covering Steve Jobs' entire life, this movie looks at it through what is essentially a cluster sample, using the moments before 3 crucial presentations which took place place over his career: that of the Macintosh, the NeXT Cube, and the iMac. It's more of a portrait of Steve Jobs than a photograph, as Aaron Sorkin says. Obviously, all the important figures in Steve Jobs' life did not suddenly decide to confront him in the minutes before all these presentations (this is even ironically addressed by a line late in the film). But that doesn't matter, because it does everything a biopic should- it addresses his accomplishments, the man underneath, his evolution over time, and the evolution of his relationships with those around him. The gaps between these segments are also very well done, using a mixture of news reports, images and Bob Dylan songs to bring us up to speed with the years in between them. Overall, it's a breathtakingly efficient and innovative approach that I can easily see influencing future biopics. Another flash of brilliance is the way the movie's filmed: the first segment, in grainy 16 mm film, the second in 35 mm, and the final in digital, subtly conveying technological advancement through the years.<br/><br/>Now on to the meat of the movie. I've spent a whole paragraph raving about its structure and technical qualities, but none of that matters if the actual movie falls flat. Luckily, however, Steve Jobs is a showcase of brilliant, Oscar-worthy acting and writing. Let's start with the acting. Lead actor Michael Fassbender looks absolutely nothing like Steve Jobs; regardless of that, he absolutely vanishes into the role, and by the end of the film you almost forget that they're different people. It's towering, breathtaking, a performance to marvel at, and if he isn't nominated for Best Actor, I'll eat my ten-gallon hat. Kate Winslet is remarkable as his assistant Joanna Hoffman, the only person with the (metaphorical) balls to tell Jobs what's up. The exasperation Jobs causes her really comes through, as does the love she has for him as a person. I see a Best Supporting Actress nod in her future. I'm really not playing it fast and loose with the Oscar predictions, even though it sounds like it, especially after this statement: Seth Rogen is going to get an Oscar nom. His turn as Steve Wozniak conveys the lasting sting of betrayal, the awkward, timid manner of the man, and the collision of both when he and Jobs go at it. He more than holds his own with Fassbender and the rest of the cast, and for all the critics who think his range is limited to stoner movies, this provides a forceful counterpoint. Jeff Daniels has scenes of fiery passion and quiet reflection as John Sculley, nailing both ends of the spectrum. Michael Stuhlbarg is worth a mention as Andy Hertzfeld, an abused programmer under Jobs' employ. I was excited to see Sarah Snook in this movie, given her knockout performance in Predestination, but she's given an unsalvageably small amount to work with here, sadly. All three actresses who portray Jobs' daughter Lisa are remarkable as well, and Catherine Waterston, playing their mother, gives an intense performance.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the writing. I'm a sucker for a little Sorkinese, The Social Network being my favorite film of the decade so far, and this movie has it in spades. This movie is almost entirely composed of arguments, and nobody writes arguments quite as good as Sorkin. The dialogue sings, and the movie moves with the pulse of an action film, with every conversation carrying with it the energy of a fight scene. It's absolute music to the ears. <br/><br/>Man, what a rambling review. But I had to talk about this movie. If I can convince just one person to go see it, it'll have been worth it. Don't go see Steve Jobs because you want to support the man himself, his products or his company. Go see Steve Jobs because you want to support great cinema."
"HotlineSF","7","1","5","25 October 2015"," great premise bogged down by relentless focus on jobs' family life
","the premise is that instead of a linear plot-driven portrayal of Jobs' life, this film is split into 3 segments providing a behind-the-scenes look at preparations for the product launches of the Mac, Next Computer, and the iMac. It's a fantastic idea. Those who read Walter Isaacson's biography Steve Jobs - on which this is apparently based - know the man was incredibly driven and consumed by his work, often to the detriment of friends and family. This is a good opportunity to show him in his element, while providing subtle glimpses into the contentious relationship Jobs had with his family.<br/><br/>The execution falls short of this premise. There are good scenes throughout, including a bit where Jobs argues the necessity of ensuring the Mac speaks the word ""hello"" to the audience. These bits focusing on the inner struggles at Apple and the intense charismatic performance of Fassbender work in the movie's favor.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there's a deliberate push to make Jobs relationship with his ex-gf Chrisann and their daughter Lisa a big part of the film. In this movie it feels like Chrisann and Lisa have backstage passes at every Apple event, and they just show up hours beforehand to hang out and argue about Steve's parenting. The extent to which they focuses on Jobs' familial problems, especially within the context of these supposed product launches, feels forced and unnatural. You know it's bad when Joanna Hoffman (Jobs' top aide in the film) deliberately takes precious time out of their preparations to berate him on his fatherly responsibilities.<br/><br/>It's clear the writers made a concerted (and heavyhanded) effort to inject drama into this story, but it's unnecessary and ultimately results in a good, but uneven product.<br/><br/>thoughts on sorkin: prepare yourselves! this film has no real plot, and it feels like the producers gave Sorkin carte blanche, so the whole thing is like a long stereotypical Aaron Sorkin scene, with characters walking really fast while constantly bickering and dispensing caustic one-liners. I'm a huge fan of The Social Network, but parts of this flick felt a bit too Sorkiny for my tastes. ""everything in moderation"", as they say."
"cultfilmfan","10","1","5","25 October 2015"," Steve Jobs
","One of the best descriptions I have read of the new film, Steve Jobs, is that it is like a play, or an opera done in four different parts. In describing this, I will not be giving away anything about the film, but may instead draw more interest on your behalf to the film, or perhaps just the opposite. The film is written by Aaron Sorkin (who wrote the brilliant screenplay to 2010's The Social Network) and based upon the book by Walter Isaacson. The film is divided up into four different parts and as earlier described, this is like watching a play, or an opera because each of these segments of the film is for the most part, consisting of only a couple of characters and actors on set at a time (there may be some lingering in the background to fill out the scene), but generally the main action and dialogue in each of these sections consists of back and forth dialogue between Michael Fassbender (who plays Steve Jobs) and any number of the various supporting actors and characters that go along with this true story. Each scene is set up as a play, or opera and ultimately plays out that way as well. This is a film with no action, no special effects, or anything like that, so for those seeking that, they better look elsewhere. Instead we get these brilliantly set up scenes with Aaron Sorkin's top notch dialogue and each of these great actors and actresses interacting with each other and with the fantastic writing and lines they are delivering, this is pure movie-making for any fan of the craft and an absolute joy and pleasure to watch. No action is needed in this film because Sorkin's dialogue and script is so good that he manages to cover a good part of Jobs' life and what was going on around him into these four parts of the movie using these great actors and instead of showing the action it is all described to you in detail with the great back and forth dialogue between the actors. I know that to a lot of you, the idea of watching a couple of people in one room, just basically talking back and forth between each other for the duration of the movie must sound like pure torture and like something that would be painful and extremely boring to sit through. These people couldn't be more wrong. Steve Jobs is so fascinating to watch because of the great writing and dialogue between the characters and each of these actors and actresses so brilliantly get into these roles and can debate and recite these lines as if they went to the top acting and debating schools because the lines and the performances are pulled off so flawlessly here. The film also showcases Jobs' life through dialogue and we see him at various stages in his life focusing on his business enterprises, his relationships with those around him including coworkers and an estranged wife and daughter as well as how in many ways he was a ruthless business man who had a vision and would stop at nothing, or no one to achieve what he truly thought was best for his product, company and stock shareholders. Something that is no doubt going to pop into the minds of many people watching this film is why there was made a film of a man like Steve Jobs, who perhaps in many ways isolated himself away from family and the affections and considerations of others only to become extremely wealthy and looking after his own self? A lot of people may be against Jobs the person and the movie made about him because of this. Even for those who are anti business and anti capitalist, there is still a message here and a great story to be told and without giving anything away, the film does show some tenderness on Jobs' part and doesn't demonize the man, but instead does what any decent and accurate portrayal would do, and that is to make him human. Sure, there are things that we may be turned off about regarding Jobs and his treatment of his coworkers and business partners and right down to his own wife and daughter, but when we really look at the film we do see that there is a tenderness as I mentioned above in the mind and behaviour of Jobs and that is something that is explored throughout the film and by the end of the movie I think that is clearly seen and understood. As well as his icy coldness towards others and his ruthlessness in the business world, whereas I might not have taken the same route as him if I were in that position and you may argue that you wouldn't have either, you still have to be impressed at him as being the conductor behind the massive orchestra and business that Apple became and no matter what Jobs was like as a person, you have to acknowledge that he did know what he was doing, what he wanted and how he was going to achieve it. Plus, I am sure many of you reading this are operators of such Apple products and may be even using them now while you are reading this. Ultimately this version of Steve Jobs is filled with top notch writing, brilliant performances and excellent direction in a film that is both fascinating, in some ways a cautious tale, but all the same one that is totally human and honest and for that it is a masterpiece."

","Since we can only score whole numbers on the review part of the IMDb section I gave it an eight when in reality I would give it an 8.5. If you are looking for an exact biographical movie that stayed true to the exact events of what happened, this movie is not for you. Even though yes a lot of the events that happened really did occur in real life I highly doubt that he had confrontations with the exact same people 40 minutes before every main launch in his life. Danny Boyle's directing is a perfect collaboration with Aaron sorkins writing style. It is brilliantly almagated in the most amazing way. I would suggest this to anyone who loves character studies or people who like to look at things in a different view."

","This movie is so fantastic. As Sorkin goes, not quite as good as The Social Network, but probably up there with Moneyball. I loved this. I think this movie really lets you get to know Steve Jobs. Yoh actually understand him. You go in thinking he was just an asshole, and it portrays him that way. Though you understand his character, and he isn't just completely unlikeable, which I expected him to be. <br/><br/>Michael Fassbender plays Jobs perfectly, and gives him an incredible performance, probably his best since Shame. Kate Winslet is incredible as well, and honestly just as good as Fassbender. I honestly see her winning best supporting actress. I had no idea her character was from Poland, and she nails the accent perfectly. It's her best performance in years. Seth Rogen was also great as Steve Wozniak, and probably his best performance, but not quite Oscar- caliber. <br/><br/>I also have to talk about Danny Boyle's directing, which is magnificent. It's just as stylish as always, but never distracting. In case you guys didn't know, this film is essentially 3 long scenes that take place before the launch of a major apple product, with a few flashbacks in between. Danny Boyle shot each scene differently, as the tech world evolutionized. The first scene was shot in 16 mm, the second in 35 mm, and the last in digital. This seems gimmicky, but it works so well.<br/><br/>You'd think that a movie that's just 3 long scenes would be boring, but the film has so much energy and intensity. I loved every second of it. I was engaged in the film, my eyes were glued to the screen. There was a scene in the film, where Jobs goes into the bathroom and looks in the mirror, and I literally thought for a second I was going to see a reflection of myself in the mirror. THAT'S how engaging it is. I totally forgot I was watching a movie. This is a 9.5/10 for me. I definitely recommend it."

AKA many people talking. Very eloquently.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs, in all his (difficult) glory, clashes with representative figures in his life: his daughter, daughter's mother, and work-wife; his Apple partner, boss, and programmer. We are swept up in the backstage energy of pre-launch secrets and product issues, honesty spawning hysteria, friends emerging as frenemies, strategy for justice or revenge, ideology versus money, and at the heart of it all, deep beneath an icy, scathing surface: Steve's passion and his daughter.<br/><br/>Three pivotal debuts of Steve Jobs as a creator are brought to life by raw, brutally honest performances. The movie's orchestra of human nature plays no false notes. We empathize with everyone, even going so far as to dive into Steve's mind, achieved by seamless editing of memories that affect his present thoughts, particularly potent of father figure Sculley, and of his daughter Lisa.<br/><br/>Conventional Computing Biographies condense a whole lifetime into series of significant events. Inevitably, writers rewrite history and some parts are glossed over, left out, simplified, and customized to many, many different versions.<br/><br/>iBiopic by Aaron Sorkin has a simple structure and intricate core.

Still didn't get a sense how much of it was true vs an interpretation of history.<br/><br/>It got very tiresome trying to determine if Steve Jobs was an autistic, obsessive compulsive sociopath with low self esteem or one of the most clever business and marketing strategist the world has ever seen especially when the movie implies how he used NEXT to embarrass or motivate Scully who had fired him from Apple. It will require a second viewing to be sure. At best the movie made it appear there was some weird business mixed with personal politics issues going on at Apple.<br/><br/>But I'm of the sort that likes speaking and learning truth of the dead but I'm not sure I got both in this movie because it covered too much history in order for me to keep up.<br/><br/>I was hoping the movie would've recreated and conveyed the magic aura I felt seeing each new Mac release four of them I bought since '98, but focus was placed more on interpersonal relationships within the company.<br/><br/>Oh well.

","You know you have just watched something special when you sit through the credits and don't want to leave when the lights go up. Steve Jobs is something special.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs stars Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels and Seth Rogan. It is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin. Despite barring few resemblances to the actual man, Fassbender is award-worthy in his portrayal of Steve Jobs. Equally as impressive are Winslet and Rogan, who are perfect in their roles. Jeff Daniels absolutely steals the scenes he is in, crushing every line out of the park. <br/><br/>On a technical level, Steve Jobs is, quite frankly, perfect. Boyle maximizes the use of different mm and digital filmmaking, capturing the time they were in. The way certain scenes flow and flashbacks are smoothly inserted is masterful to watch. The man we have been counting down to, Aaron Sorkin, does not at all disappoint. Like The Social Network and Moneyball, Steve Jobs has the fast paced, engaging dialogue you would expect. But what is different about Steve Jobs is the emotional punch that it packs. Once again, Sorkin takes a character, makes him utterly dislikable and gets us to care about him on some level. The ending is truly beautiful and leaves you in awe.<br/><br/>What makes this film so special is that it is a mirror image of its real life subject. At times it is over the top, brash, aggravating, but undeniably genius and captivating. These were the characteristics of Steve Jobs the person, and this is perfectly translated into the film. I was engrossed for the entire running time, and wanted another hour or two when it ended.<br/><br/>Overall, Steve Jobs showcases some of its A-list cast's best work, while playing beautifully into its subjects personality. Boyle and Sorkin compliment each other to a perfect degree, and Steve Jobs might just be my favorite film this year. I hate perfect scores, but I'm not even hesitating with this one. I can't wait to watch this film again and again."
"paul-allaer","9","1","6","23 October 2015"," Comparing ""Steve Jobs"" vs. ""Jobs"", and the winner is...
","""Steve Jobs"" (2015 release; 122 min.) is the latest movie about Steven Jobs. As the movie opens, we see archive TV footage of Arthur C. Clarke describing how he think the computer will dominate life in 2001. We then switch to ""1984, Cupertino, CA, Macintosh Launch"", where we see Jobs arguing with everyone to get the voice demo fixed. ""It needs to say Hello, because it can"", Jobs observes. At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Dannie ""Slum Millionaire"" Boyle, with a script from Aaron ""The Social Network"" Sorkin. The movie credits note that this is ""Based on the book Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson"", but it is more accurate to say this is loosely inspired by the book, as the movie is almost nothing like the book. In fact, the movie only has three specific 'chapters' (the Macintosh launch in 1984, the NeXT box launch in 1988, and the iMac launch in 1998), although certain other pivotal moments are brought in flashbacks. The impression created by Doyle and Sorkin is that Jobs was an impossible guy to deal with, refusing to recognize his daughter Lisa (even though there was a 94% certainty he was her dad), for whom in the end ""the product"" was everything, to the exclusion of anything else. I have no idea whether this is a correct reflection of Jobs, or an exaggerated one. But it makes for a heck of a movie. I must admit I was skeptical going in whether this was a good movie, but I was sadly mistaken. Michael Fassbinder is outstanding as Steve Jobs (even while lacking the physical resemblance), and maybe even better is Kate Winslet, virtually unrecognizable as Joanna Hoffman, Steve's confidant at the company. I thought Seth Rogen was equally fine as Steve Wozniak. Last but not least, there is a terrific soundtrack, courtesy of up-and-coming movie composer Daniel Pemberton. (There are also a number of Dylan songs, including ""Shelter From the Storm"" over the movie's end titles, reflecting Jobs' admiration for Dylan.) A few years ago there was a movie called ""Jobs"" (starring Ashton Kutchner), which is a very different movie altogether. It is a more traditional bio-pic, while ""Steve Jobs"" is anything but that. ""Jobs"" was readily dismissed as lightweight even by those who hadn't seen it, in part because of Kutchner, and that is a real shame, as he gave the performance of his life in that role, and it is a interesting movie. That said, having seen both movies, it is now clear to me that of the two, ""Steve Jobs"" is the better movie, period. But I would encourage you to seek out ""Jobs"" if you haven't seen it yet.<br/><br/>""Steve Jobs"" expanded nationally this weekend, and the early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely, but was by no means a sell-out. From all I can tell, the audience really liked the movie, and I think with strong word-of-mouth. ""Steve Jobs"" will do quite well, also when the award nomination season starts later this year and into early 2016. Jobs was a one-of-a-kind person, and this movie certainly does not shy away from showing the lesser side of Jobs. ""I'm poorly made"", admits Jobs. ""Steve Jobs"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

","'STEVE JOBS': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The new biopic about the life, and career, of Steve Jobs; the revolutionary co-founder of Apple Inc.. The film was directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin; it's based on the 2011 biography book, of the same name, by Walter Isaacson. The movie stars Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs; and it costars Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels and Michael Stuhlbarg. It's received almost nothing but rave reviews, from critics, and it's also considered an early Oscar frontrunner; at next year's Academy Awards. I absolutely loved it!<br/><br/>The story plays out over three acts (that are all pretty close in running length); detailing three important new product launches, in the career of Steve Jobs (Fassbender). It begins in 1984, with the introduction of the Macintosh. The film then continues through 1988, with the debut of NeXT computer. It concludes in 1998, with the launch of iMac. We experience what Jobs was going through, involving everyone around him, during these three critical times in his career. The film especially focuses on Jobs' relationship with his daughter, Lisa (played by Peria Haney-Jardine, Ripley Sobo and Makenzie Moss). <br/><br/>A lot of people have compared this movie to 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' (even going as far as to call it 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK 2'), and there are a lot of definite similarities. Both films were written by Aaron Sorkin (a genius screenwriter), and both tell the story of a similarly flawed, but very gifted man; who became an iconic revolutionist, in the technological world (and the world in general). Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs are both very unlikable men; but they're also both very inspiring, and brilliant people. Both movies ask the question 'Can a great person, who accomplishes great things, also be a good, and compassionate, human being?'. The answer is obviously yes (at least in my opinion), but some would disagree; these films love to analyze that subject. I enjoyed 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' more, but this movie comes pretty close to matching it (David Fincher was even set to direct 'STEVE JOBS', at one point!). This is definitely a big improvement over the 2013 'JOBS' film (starring Ashton Kutcher). It's one of those movies that everyone needs to see; and it's definitely one of the best films of the year, without question!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/f4ptmnmXTWE"

","As a kid, I was always enamored by Steve Jobs' larger-than-life personality. I have owned multiple versions of the iPod, and I couldn't be more wowed by his genius. That was until the Isaacson biography came out, and whatever I'd read of that book (which is an excellent unbiased piece on the man, although for some reason I couldn't complete it), I did recognize Jobs' flaws.<br/><br/>After the disaster that was the Ashton Kutcher movie (although kudos to Kutcher for nailing the mannerisms), I really wanted this movie. I was hugely excited when I heard Fincher was in talks, and the Fincher-Sorkin duo has yielded an excellent result in the form of The Social Network. But the Sony hack said otherwise. Much later, when it was announced that Danny Boyle would take over (another director who's very accomplished in my opinion), I didn't think very highly of him as a director for this kind of movie.<br/><br/>The movie was a lot of fictionalized dialogue and situational drama. But what the dialogue contained was surely true. Steve Jobs has created such an enigmatic image around himself, that nobody needed to see a movie of his greatness in my honest opinion. Which is why I loved the structure of this movie, and how it expressed those flaws, albeit in fictional situations. Fassbender was a great, great Jobs, even though he didn't nail the look of the younger Steve Jobs. Kate Winslet was evergreen, she is just, well, phenomenal. Rogen as Woz was also surprisingly a good turn by the otherwise goofy actor, and he nailed the Woz vibe. The dialogue was as Sorkin-y as it could get - rapid fast exchanges, solid retorts and burns, and ultimately a lot of closure.<br/><br/>You see a Steve Jobs that started out as an immature person who said that 28% of American men could be his daughter's father. The gradual development of how he settled all of that was heartwarming to see. There's a lot of anguish in between, which is why it feels so good to see the movie end like that. He realizes that it isn't a binary, that he could be decent and gifted simultaneously. That's why I loved this movie. It made me have a little more respect for the flawed Jobs that I knew. Of course, a Fincher version might have been better, but I'm not complaining. I thoroughly enjoyed what Boyle brought to the table. 9.5/10."

","This is an odd way to do a biography and was more of a character study with flashbacks. The film is divided into three basic scenes and if you are concerned about PLOT SPOILERS don't read on, but I will be gentle. The first 35 minutes of the film is a behind the scenes look at the roll out of the MAC computer. We meet Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) his ""work wife"" and right arm. We also meet his daughter Lisa and her mother (Katherine Waterston) along with the major characters at Apple. The next 40 minutes is a behind the scenes look at the roll out of the Cube, and again we get more character study of Steve (Michael Fassbender) and more flashbacks...and some more of Lisa. The rest of the film jumps to 1998 and behind the scenes look at roll out of I-MAC and more of Lisa.<br/><br/>If you want a biography and a film most people can easily digest the Ashton Kutcher film is superior. This film has some aspects for the technology based audience as well as those who are curious about the unusual father-daughter relationship that Jobs maintained.

","Steve Jobs is a terrific movie with terrific acting, especially from Michael Fassbender as the title character. It is thoroughly entertaining and engaging, Danny Boyle sets a quick pace that never lets down, and the dialogue is a perfect example of Aaron Sorkin's ear for witty, intense patter.<br/><br/>But what I found most striking about the movie was the ingenuity of its design, which managed to take a very loose collection of incidents and turn it into a coherent whole.<br/><br/>The movie has three acts, each one devoted to a single product launch by Jobs. People are running around trying to finalize things, Jobs is making demands, but all through preparation his friends and relatives are importuning him on this and that. The movie is best summed up by Job when he says ""It's like five minutes before every launch everyone goes to the bar and then tells me what they really think of me.""<br/><br/>The amazing thing is how nicely this works. Certain themes keep reappearing, so that even though these events are years apart they flow neatly into one another.<br/><br/>The ending is a neat trick, taking one of the film's threads and making it feel like that's what the movie was really all about, even though it was probably 20% of the movie, so that you have a satisfying ending.<br/><br/>There are some minor issues, such as Kate Winslet's accent, which inexplicably gets stronger as the years progress. Also, there is little interest here in historical accuracy, so you probably shouldn't take much of anything here as gospel. But as storytelling this is absolutely terrific."

Like Jobs, I worked at the Warm Springs, Fremont facility in 1984 where the first Mac was manufactured.<br/><br/>If the intent of the film was to simply slander the man for his shortcomings as a family man ........ terrific ... they succeeded. If they intended to portray what was actually occurring at the time and the why's and how's .......... it failed miserably. Yes he was tough on his directs .......... but he was also quite approachable by everyone that worked at Apple during their trying years.

","I've watched this film now twice within a week time span. Being familiar with some aspects of Steve Jobs' life, I was fascinated with how biographical details are woven into the script. Also seeing the launching of 3 different products was compelling on some level as it is the behind the scenes look at these events that makes up the action.<br/><br/>This film is written more like a theater piece with very strong dialogue and characters. I'm not familiar with screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, and his other work so I was not prepared to be drawn into this film as much as I was.<br/><br/>Regarding the acting, Kate Winslet's immersion into her role was admirable and something I've grown to realize she, as an actor, does very very well.

","Watching this movie made me wonder about all the other so-called biographical movies I've seen. The facts presented here are so far from the truth, I found it almost offensive.<br/><br/>As someone who's career was basically built on and inspired by the phenomenal technological and design decisions made by Steve Jobs (and having followed all publications about him practically daily since 1984), I do not think that this movie portrays Steve's true inspirations and aspirations at all. There was a greater good, but this movie doesn't show it.<br/><br/>Steve was well documented as frequently behaving like a jerk, but no matter how detestable, almost without exception those instances could be explained logically and served an overall purpose to those who understood him. I did not see this overall purpose and drive in this movie, nor did I see the inspiration. And then to suggest that (spoiler alert) Steve started NeXT and built its fantastic OS and OO architecture with the purpose of selling it back to Apple... come on that is just utter BS. And making a system closed had good reasons that are totally ignored here.<br/><br/>It is harsh to give this movie one of the lowest ratings I've given. Three stars, for great acting, exciting direction, and not feeling that the two hours watching it weren't a total loss of time. But sorry, if I were Steve I would not be happy about this movie totally ignoring facts and only focusing on the darkest aspects of his character. This should have been a different movie.<br/><br/>""Jobs"" with Ashton Kutcher was much more compatible with reality."

","A crackerjack screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and good performances by a talented cast led by Michael Fassbender are the biggest assets of ""Steve Jobs."" <br/><br/>Danny Boyle, one of my least favorite directors, shows an unusual amount of restraint in telling this biographical story about Steve Jobs' firing and subsequent return to Apple. The film is not a standard biopic, for which I was eternally grateful. This is not the life story of Jobs, but rather selected episodes from his meteoric rise, fall, and rise again set against the backdrop of various product launches. The film isn't based on a play, but it wouldn't have surprised me if it had been. It takes place in few locations, most of them cramped interiors, and consists of verbal showdown after showdown, usually involving no more than two or three people. Indeed, the film does teeter on the brink of monotony at times -- the viewer feels like he's hearing the same argument for the third and fourth time by the film's end. But Sorkin's rapid fire, witty dialogue makes up adequately for any dramatic inertness in the screenplay, and the witty one-liners fly with the abandon of a screwball comedy, making the viewer pay attention if he wants to hear all the jokes. Sorkin reminds me of a modern-day Paddy Chayefsky. When Beatrice Straight accepted her Oscar for ""Network,"" she thanked Chayefsky for writing thoughts that people always feel but can never articulate (I'm paraphrasing). That's what Sorkin does. He has his characters say the things you would want to be able to say if you were in the same situation.<br/><br/>Fassbender was justly Oscar-nominated for his performance, and now that I've actually seen all of the nominees in that category for that year, I think he should have won. Winslet also received her seventh nomination for playing Jobs' marketing director and his girl Friday.<br/><br/>Boyle resists the urge to direct the film to within an inch of its life, his predominant directorial style, and instead sits back and lets the screenplay and his actors do the heavy lifting. A wise decision.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"subadc-74110","4","0","1","11 September 2016"," No wonder it bombed at he box office
","To be honest it does not surprise me this film bombed.<br/><br/>I worked for IBM in the UK during the 1980s and 1990s, developing software for the PC, so I lived through the whole IBM / Microsoft / Apple saga from that period. I have also read a number of books on Jobs (including the one this film was based on).<br/><br/>And Steve Jobs did make some huge mistakes during that 80s/90s period (after all he was sacked from Apple, the company he formed). <br/><br/>However many of today's film goers (the ones in their 20s and 30s who make up the bulk of today's cinema audiences) have grown up with their ipods, ipads, iphones and iTunes, and to them Steve Jobs is almost a hero. They don't want to see a film which is pretty much a hatchet job on the man. <br/><br/>It covers three major project launches (two of which failed), the original Apple Macintosh (which failed), his Next computers (which failed), and the original iMac, which could be considered a success (and the start of his second great phase at Apple) though any iMac success is not actually mentioned in the film).<br/><br/>It also shows him as a terrible father, a pretty terrible boss, a terrible workmate, and a pretty terrible ""friend"" (even to those like ""Andy"" and Woz who stuck by him). <br/><br/>He rarely smiles in the film and he hardly shows anyone any affection (even when his daughter cuddles him, much to his shock and surprise).<br/><br/>Also because each of the three sections cover just the one ""launch"" day (and they are almost filmed in ""real time"") they are very intense. Watching this film is quite hard work, it left me exhausted at the end. <br/><br/>I should also say that because I have a good knowledge of computers, and know the Steve Jobs ""story"" already, I could follow pretty much everything that was going on, but for those who were not very computer literate or did not know most of the story, then much of it must have seemed like a foreign language. <br/><br/>So overall I have no objection to showing the ""bad"" side of Steve jobs, as long as you show the good side, maybe reduce the lengths of the first three sections and have a ""positive"" fourth section showing the launch of the iphone or ipad, or a mention of Pixar (or all 3).<br/><br/>Something to bolster up the very negative view of the man in the first three sections by a more positive view in a new fourth section.<br/><br/>As it stands the film is just a three act ""hatchet job"" with hardly a redeeming feature."
"midas-jacobs","9","0","1","13 August 2016"," Danny Boyles best movie that I've seen!
","""Steve Jobs"" is about, obviously, Steve Jobs. In this movie we don't get to see his whole life, just three parts of it. But these three parts were career defining for him.<br/><br/>The director of this movie is also known from other Oscar winning films e.g.: ""127 Hours"" and ""Slumdog Millionaire"". The director is of course Danny Boyle. I liked his previous films very much, ""127 Hours"" more than ""Slumdog Millionaire"". He is a very good director with his own special style, which he didn't really let shine in this movie. This is not necessarily a bad thing, because I think that this might have otherwise ruined the movie. Well Imight be exaggerating a bit, but it still wouldn't have the same quality as it has now. At some points his style can be seen, like when there is a conversation between two people and some of their text is shown projected. This was very nicely done, and made the movie stand up more, from a cinematographic standpoint. I don't know if Danny Boyle had any influence in what I'm going to say next, but I think he had. I very much liked the fact that they used different camera's in each time-period. This was something very subtle, and only really noticeable if you were paying attention. This just fitted in right with the theme of the movie and showed the progression of electronics, also something that the movie is based around. You might have enough about me talking about Danny Boyle so let's move on a bit. The cinematography was done well. The editing too, but the pacing was a bit to fast for my taste. The scenes were always on a rapid tempo, which I believe was done to show how tense it was behind the curtain, but making it some fast paced also made it difficult to follow sometimes. Even though this isn't a big issue, I still would like to mention it, because that is really my only complaint. At times the movie was cleverly edited, by showing bits of a dialogue in the past, and one from in the current present. This was complex, but gave a beautiful end result.<br/><br/>The acting is the thing this movie got praised for. So was it that good? Yes. It was really good. Let's start of with the main actor, the one who played Steve Jobs, Micheal Fassbender. Fassbender is a very good actor and he shows it in this movie as well. He portrayed Steve Jobs really good, he didn't look anything like him, but he surely did a good job at portraying him. I don't think he deserved the Oscar-nomination for this movie. I think he deserved it for the movie ""Macbeth"". In that movie I found him to be way better than he was in this one. Kate Winslett is also in the movie, and she too did get nominated for an Oscar. Winslett played Joanna Hoffman. She was also very good, just sometimes I think her accent went away, but it was just barely noticeable. I think she did deserve the Oscar nomination, because I think that she was a tad better than Fassbender. The last actor I want to mention is Seth Rogen. Rogen played Wozniak, the person with whom Steve Jobs created Apple. Rogen normally plays in dumb comedies, but he has also played in some more serious movies like ""50/50"" for example. In that movie he proved that he can act in serious films, and in this one he does it again. In fact, I found him to be better in this movie than in ""50/50""<br/><br/>The writing of the movie was really the star. I can't understand why Aaron Sorkin, the scriptwriter, didn't win, or at least get nominated for best screenplay. It was so well written. How Sorkin portrayed Steve Jobs as an asshole reminded me of ""The Social Network"", where he did the same with Mark Zuckerberk. But he just doesn't portray them as assholes, he does it with such care, that you somehow kind of feel for them. Such a brilliant Screenplay writer. His dialogue was very interesting, which was very important with a movie like this: it is a dialogue driven movie. There are no fight scenes, as you would expect. The story is about Steve Jobs life, but mainly focuses on his relationship with his daughter, or at least with the girls who is not sure of is his daughter or not. This was handled beautifully and showed the more human side of Steve Jobs. Maybe the best part of the movie was the ending. The part the whole movie was building up to. The last couple of scenes were so well crafted that the ending was so satisfying to watch. It showed the love that Steve Jobs had for his daughter, but also his future success.<br/><br/>To wrap this review up I'll quickly summarize what I've mentioned in the review. The movie was well directed and acted, but Micheal Fassbender didn't really deserve the Oscar nomination, even though he did a good job. The screenplay was written wonderfully, and this is the thing that díd deserve an Oscar. ""Steve Jobs"" is my favorite Danny Boyle film and that's why I'm giving it an 9.4/10."
"bob the moo","Null","0","1","2 July 2016"," Not perfect but its pace and scale makes for an engaging and intriguing character piece
","There is a certain irony (or perhaps deliberate synergy) in terms of how this film is constructed, and the subject it delivers. The focus is Steve Jobs, and we follow him in a three-stage film mostly spent backstage ahead of various product launches. We see products which are not quite as good as they are ready to be, being launched with a lot of energy and promotion. The same could be said of the film itself, because on the content level there is perhaps not as much to connect to as it may seem at first. Sorkin does his usual thing as writer – keeping everything moving quickly and with energy so that it is easy to get caught up in the pace. The script does deliver an engaging character piece, but there is not a great deal of reason to care about it – more to be intrigued by it.<br/><br/>Despite this the film does work really well for what it is. The operatic scale and pace of the film is one of the main reasons for this; it sweeps across the years and uses flashback snippets to inform to good effect. The energy from this draws the viewer into the film, but it is the performances that keeps us there. Fassbender is brutal in his depiction; very on point throughout and plays the character in line with the writing. The support is just that, but still Winslet, Daniels, Rogan, and others all provide a strong base of performances for the lead to play off against.<br/><br/>It is not a perfect film by any means, but in its pace and scale it makes for an engaging and intriguing character piece."
"pinokiyo","4","0","1","19 June 2016"," A Symphony of Yelling and Arguing
","Be prepared to listen to 2 hours of just constant yelling and arguing. If you have no idea who Steve Jobs, Woz, or know about PC/MAC, this is NOT the film to watch first.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Pirates of Silicon Valley (it's a TNT original TV movie first, which is best and entertaining film about Steve Jobs/Bill Gates by far) or even Ashton Kutcher's version ""Jobs"" as a MUCH MORE FRIENDLY starter. <br/><br/>This film dives you straight to the ""warzone"" with just constant arguing. It is NOT a feel good watching experience. In fact, it can add stress to your ears. If you're stressed, this film will just add more stress on top of you. It's just too much. <br/><br/>The whole film basically just always takes place backstage a few minutes before the presentations with all these drama thrown at Steve at the last minute prior to the show -- WHICH IS NOT FACTUAL (except for the beginning scene where the 'Hello' error was coming up) -- but simply done for dramatic effect for the movie. Steve has to deal with his wife, daughter, Woz, John Sculley butting heads with ALL of them right before his show, which is a bit ridiculous setup. The film just gets so claustrophobic taking place backstage the whole movie. <br/><br/>If you were eager or expecting to see how Steve Jobs developed his products or demonstrating it on stage, you will be disappointed because 90% of the film just takes place backstage arguing with different people. <br/><br/>There are no scenes of the actual presentation or building process. <br/><br/>The film mainly focuses on Steve after he's fired from Apple/NeXT days and is also focused more on the relationship with his daughter. <br/><br/>The movie takes an hour of arguing before we finally get an intriguing scene of Michael Fassbender actually begin to look like Steve Jobs with his iconic turtleneck, jeans, and glasses look along with the iMac; I would have preferred, and I'm sure many would have liked, to see moments like this, which is refreshing, than the arguing parts. <br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin, screenwriter for this film, as well as that Facebook movie ""The Social Network"" is a writer that puts in WAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY too much ramblings in dialogue. You can tell right away who the writer was because nobody puts in so much damn ramblings into the dialogue like Aaron Sorkin. Does he not know the meaning LESS IS MORE??? It's good to have some balance and break between, but this film is just full of long ramblings where it takes you out of it. It makes Steve Jobs more identical to portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg; we get that they're both geniuses, but the screen writing just makes them ramble on forever. It's really unpleasing experience. OK, we get Steve Jobs likes to argue, but there's a lot of ramblings that just drag on and we want to get to the next part already. <br/><br/>I understand the director deliberately used actors that look nothing like the real people. Michael Fassbender looks nothing like Steve, but as an actor, Fassbender always has a powerful presence in films (Yes, he's Magneto). And Seth Rogen looks nothing like Woz, but he was definitely chosen for the goofy light-hearted image; they do capture the overall ""image"". Fassebender began the film like he was trying to portray Bill Gates more, but ironically, in the second half of the film, when he puts on the glasses and jeans look, he gets more convincing as Steve Jobs (the skinny Steve Jobs when he was getting ill) <br/><br/>Ashton Kutcher really resembles Steve Jobs facially, but I really like Noah Wyle (Pirates of Silicon Valley) as Steve Job. Another actor I think who looks like Noah Wyle is Christian Bale; Bale would play the perfect jerk roles. Fassenbender, as well as other actors in this film, are more of an abstract portrayal. <br/><br/>Again, if you're expecting to see Apple product presentations or the building process or how Steve Jobs got started, etc. this film is not for you. <br/><br/>The film is mainly about the relationship of Steve and his daughter and his behaviors (the Apple products themselves all take a backseat) -- all just taking place backstage before the presentations, which was just done for dramatic effect and NOT factual. The film is just entirely an abstract/metaphorical representation of Steve Jobs (including the look of the actors) - not a direct-copy documentary play- by-play.<br/><br/>There are some moments that make you chuckle, like the hinting of the iPads, but the ending is just a bit anti-climactic.<br/><br/>While 'Pirates of Silicon Valley' is able to show both the brilliant side of Steve Jobs, the dark side, and more of a poor victim against Bill Gates, this film lacks on the brilliance, rather just a complete crazy sociopathic jerk. <br/><br/>There were some memorable arguing, like between Steve and Woz, but honestly, there are so many arguing going on in this film, some just drag on and feel pointless (like with his wife where she keeps nagging him about the 28% - over and over and over again). <br/><br/>The beginning of the film was shot on 16mm with a very grainy look, middle of the film was shot on 35, and the last scenes were shot on digital with a really crisp look. <br/><br/>This movie is basically on the same level as Steven Spielberg's portrayal of Lincoln; if you have no idea who Lincoln was, that movie is not a good starter either, nor did it focus on Lincoln but more on the 13th Amendment (what a boring film that was); like the movie Lincoln, this film also drags on and on with convoluted dialogues and we don't really gain more than what we started with, rather just observing the personality of the character."

","Steve Jobs will forever be known for revolutionizing the world of computers. This movie gave an inside look at the events that led to Apple as they may know it in today's world.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs, played by Michael Fassbender, was determined to design the future. Despite his many challenges, Jobs was able to do just that. All throughout the movie, Jobs was portrayed as an irrational prick. But despite popular belief, he really was not. Jobs had an idea and he knew exactly how he wanted every detail of the design to be. The people that he worked with were continuously attempting to influence Jobs to change the design or do something differently. Of course, Jobs would refuse to because it would not be the computer that he visioned. One of the main conflicts was the closed case concept that he applied to the products; this is where it is not possible to open the computer unless a specific special tool was used. The purpose of this was to protect the computer from being altered by consumers to be something outside of what it was intended for. Many disagreed with Jobs, but he stood his ground and for that he was seen as a prick. It is ironic how many people doubted him but yet, to this day, all of Apple's products are built with that safeguard. Jobs was right all along.<br/><br/>This movie did a great job showing the challenges that Jobs had to face on a day to day basis. But it was more focused towards him and his idea rather than the overall picture. The ending was not the greatest; the movie was flowing smoothly but then it flt rushed when it ended. Other than that, this movie was great and it is ideal for those who enjoy a dynamic drama."

It's a look at the 40 minutes backstage before the unveiling of a product by Jobs. <br/><br/>Going into this movie I had no idea what to expect. But I knew that a combination of the genius behind Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting with the genius behind The Social Network and A Few Good Men had to be a great match. And it's the greatest collaboration I've ever seen since Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects. It's not anything like that film, but the collaboration of Boyle and Sorkin was as beautiful as what was done with Bryan Singer and Christopher McQuarrie. The direction by Boyle was beautifully done. He is very unorthodox with his directing, and embraced that with this film, and the writing adds so much to the film. The balance of technological mumbo jumbo and emotional breakdowns and arguments brought to life through tremendous acting makes this film one of the best films of 2015. If not, the best. <br/><br/>Oh yeah, the acting. Michael Fassbender deserved the Oscar a million times more than Dicaprio. Fassbender's performance was such a layered character, at times I forgot that I was watching an actor, I thought it was a documentary with real footage. Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Katherine Waterson all give amazing performances. They all react to Steve Jobs in the most human, and believable character ways that bring a whole other reason for this film to be more deserving than Spotlight. <br/><br/>All in all, this film is an amazing, realistic film that shows more of the personal, and emotional affairs of Steve Jobs. If you're expecting a regular biopic highlighting his finest hours, then you won't fully get that. But you'll receive a masterpiece crafted by Danny Boyle.

","""Steve Jobs"", by director Danny Boyle and released in 2015, can be proud of being the first biopic ever made about the life of so famous a man. However, it suffers from cruel flaws, not about technique - what Boyle masters - but from a weak plot and from an important off- topic. <br/><br/>The plot focuses on Steve Jobs's life, which is expected indeed, but also on his management methods that were known for being tyrannical. The discreet original soundtrack participates in making both climaxes in the film more powerful. What's more, the subject chosen, Steve Jobs himself, is quite a good one. This man - yet he was not a hero properly speaking - was an icon in the computer world anyway : his sense of leadership, his eye for detail and his talent for ""orchestrating"" his team's capacities and skills made Apple's products the most-bought ones nowadays, among a wide range of other brands and in a world of fierce competition. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film's biggest mistake is to only focus on a very short part of his life, cut into two, separated by a huge gap in between. We don't actually see him orchestrate his team, the process that gives birth to the MacIntosh, etc, his fall from grace in the 1980's, the difficulties he had to cope with... Moreover, both climaxes, that correspond to the two main computers released, are spoiled by a disappointing next... which doesn't really exist. The film ends brutally, with the very classic morale that can't catch up with the boring plot of the film. <br/><br/>To sum up, I would rather not recommend ""Steve Jobs"" to you.

Answer: ""I play the orchestra."" The Apple Corp. staff are great instrumentalists, and Jobs plays them to the futuristic tune of a new millennium.<br/><br/>The premise of the B-story boils down to Woz's answer to Jobs as he walks out of Jobs' life: ""It's not binary. You can have talent and also be decent."" The nugget of Jobs' vision is his understanding that the new millennium of technology consists of machines that don't look like or feel like machines, but rather like extensions of the human identity, which is mostly cerebral.<br/><br/>In the heart of the world's staunchest bastion of anti-intellectualism, the United States, Jobs made cerebration fun.<br/><br/>In ""Horatio's Drive,"" documentarian Ken Burns tells the fascinating story of how the auto was sold to the public via the first cross-country auto race that saw the drivers met by cheering crowds in small towns across the continent in 1903. Before the big race, whether or not the auto would replace horses was an unsettled question. Some little time later, Henry Ford started mass producing Fords.<br/><br/>In a parallel, before Steve Jobs, whether or not the computer would replace pen and paper was an unsettled question. Jobs was, foremost, a salesman. He was the Henry Ford of computing."
"saccitygrl","8","0","1","21 February 2016"," Looks at the character of the man rather than a biopic
","When I heard about this movie being filmed around town, I wondered how on earth another pic about Jobs got the green light. I mean, wasn't there just a Jobs film featuring Ashton Kutcher. Yuu got that film on top of others like ""The man in the machine"", ""Lost Interview"" etc. and way before that, my person favorite ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"". Frankly, was there anything more to say about this man? <br/><br/>I almost passed up this film but I am so glad that I didn't. This film explores the character of Jobs. It's not about chronological events and achievements of this man and it doesn't even pretend to be. It's a three act play that fictionalizes three events that are sort of turning points in Jobs career. This movie is what is so fantastic about fiction over other film forms. When done well in its most artistic form, fiction is able to capture the emotional truths rather than objective truths contained in a series of events. Leave the objective truths to its appropriate artisans--the territory of documentaries and docudramas. Fiction, when done well, can get to the root and this film does just that. This film is fiction at its best--great writing, great performances, great staging that keeps a largely verbal film feeling tense and driven throughout. <br/><br/>At the most superficial viewing, the film seems to tangle with the bizarre biographical element of this man's life--his relationship with his daughter. Even if you are only slightly familiar with the story of Jobs, this aspect of the story just doesn't make sense. Its weird and it betrays an aspect of the character of this man that too many biographers/reporters/filmmakers seemed rather eager to gloss over whenever you read or watch anything about this man.<br/><br/>This film is not interested in glossing over anything--the use of recurring characters carried throughout this film is a great vehicle that shows what it's like to have tangled with a person like Jobs, who by the end of the film you cannot come away with anything other than the impression that this man was basically a highly sociopathic/ narcissistic person. There are repeated references by Jobs and by others as him being a god...The mixture of love and hate the people around him feel. The loyalty to the vision that some misplace into loyalty to the man and how that man uses that loyalty to paint these close friends and colleagues again and again into ethical corners and repeated states of cognitive dissonance. Having the same characters recur, you see the damage wrought in in their lives by a relationship with such a person is a life long experience. Whether its being erased from the history of your work like Woz or like Scully, who years later refers to still receiving death threats for being the man who dared to 'fire Jobs'. <br/><br/>Whether these type of humans like Jobs are made by circumstance or born, the film alludes to both and neither and in the end shows that it doesn't really matter. If you are caught inside the 'reality bending zone' that surrounds them, as so aptly described by Winslet's character Joanna Hoffman, its a roller-coaster and the fall out is the same. <br/><br/>This movie captures the emotional damage, it shows the groupies, sycophants and enablers that surround them. It shows the opportunism and manipulation wielded by such a person. It shows how in the end these type of people are usually their own worst enemy.<br/><br/>One of my favorite moments in the film--Woz blasts Jobs backstage with the 'what do you do' attack before the launch of Next and says--""That's what men do""...and minutes later in the film Jobs goes on in a rant to Scully and uses the exact same words used by Woz--""Because that's what men do"". Classic behavior of a narcissistic person--appropriation. A pattern of behavior that is the entire reason the naysayers dislike Jobs.<br/><br/>Its no surprise that those who worked with Jobs claim the movie shows someone they didn't know or recognize. Such people never see behind the mask of these type of humans. Valuable sources of supply never see behind the mask. The mask only slips in the presence of the fodder--the 'pawns' on the chessboard--underlings, waiters, etc. who will never be heard and if heard, never believed. And the movie also shows the other group who glimpse behind the mask-- those who were emotionally close and will never be believed because they will be categorized as having an ax to grind.<br/><br/>This movie is worth the time and attention demanded by such a dialogue intense film. Its worth watching more than once actually. To me this movie is bigger than Jobs, the flawed computer marketing genius. It deserves attention because there is a serious problem in this country with lifting these type of people to such heights of reverence in society when in actuality they are the great destroyers of what most people pretend to really value and these people use those values against you to serve their own selfish needs. As the screenwriter Sorkin pointed out...""If you've got a factory full of children in China assembling phones for 17 cents an hour, you've got a lot of nerve calling someone else opportunistic""."

","'I don't want people to dislike me. I'm indifferent to whether they dislike me.' Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours, Trainspotting) directs this intelligent script by Aaron Sorkin (The Newsroom, A Few Good Men, The Social Network, The West Wing) based on Walter Isaacson's book and the result is a challenging and stimulating evening of understanding the concept of the computer age in the social media stance. Steve Jobs will always be a controversial figure, spearheading the Apple revolution in computers, and now that he is gone many books and films and docudramas emerge as we pry into his private life and study the brain and behavior of a modern day genius.<br/><br/>Three words describe Steve Jobs – 'reality distortion field' - his passion and ingenuity have been the driving force behind the digital age. However his drive to revolutionize technology was sacrificial. Ultimately it affected his family life and possibly his health. Aaron Sorkin's tough but brilliant script explores the trials and triumphs of a modern day genius, the late CEO of Apple inc. Steven Paul Jobs.<br/><br/>One of the reasons this very long film works is the sparkling cast – Michael Fassbender once again proves he is one of our top actors of the day in giving us all the facets of Jobs. He is more than ably assisted by Kate Winslet's interpretation of the important woman in Steve's career – Joanna Hoffman, as well as those who were around Jobs and influenced him – Jeff Daniels, Seth Rogen, Michael Stuhlbarg, Katherine Waterston et al.<br/><br/>A major problem wit the film is Boyle's allowing the actors to speak important passages simultaneously – a choice that may be dramatically accurate but buries the words of the lines in the process. Use subtitles so you don't miss any of the extraordinary dialogue. Despite the minor flaws this is a brilliant movie the gives insights into the contributions of one of the important figures of the 20th century."

","I'm glad this wasn't just a hagiography but it was a two hour plug of Apple computers. I supposed that is hard to avoid when making a film about the company's co-founder. And spoiler alert: he's a complete a-hole.<br/><br/>I'm not an Apple person. I'm no tech whiz but I'm not a moron, technically speaking (I'll let you decide what that means). For me Apple products are just way too expensive and not as versatile as PCand you have to pay for everything. Why should I give a hoot about the looks of my computer? And is Apple really ""better looking"" than a PC? I don't really even know what that means. I have an iPod that someone gave me as a gift and I don't use it much because iTunes is a nightmare on a PC ad you need that nightmare program to run an iPod. They are also much more complicated than a cheap MP3 player which I use for audio books on my long bike rides. So no, I don't like Apple.<br/><br/>The movie was extremely compelling and the dynamic between the two principal actors was as good as anything I've seen in movies for a while."
"brendandevere","9","0","1","11 February 2016"," A Flawed Genius?
","Steve Jobs. Flawed, controlling, narcissistic, and dare I say it......a sociopath. A genius, brilliant, driven and a man before his time. The bloke can be described in both ways but there is no doubt that he was one of the great achievers of his generation. His pursuit, vision and drive to succeed has resulted in some of the most unbelievable personal technology that humankind has come to know. Everywhere on the planet the undeniable legacy that Steve Jobs has left us all is evident. I-phones, I-pods, MacBooks and Apps are just a few of Jobs's iconic creations that are now a very big part of our daily lives. The man needed a film that could justify his existence and a performance from an actor that could be taken seriously. A Luke-warm production went down like a led balloon when it was released a few years back with the greatest error casting Ashton Kutcher in the lead role. Jobs is far too complex a character for a limited actor like Kutcher to give the role any real credibility so when a new and improved production was in the works there was some hesitation on my part to give it genuine thought.<br/><br/>Highly respected Director, Danny Boyle, is given the task of re-booting (no pun intended) Jobs' biopic. With productions such as the award winning 'Slumdog Millionaire' and the controversially brilliant 'Trainspotting', Boyle brings a fresh new look at the man that was at the forefront of personal technology at the beginning of the millennium. Based on Walter Issacson's non-fiction book and with a narrative written by the equally respected Aaron Sorkin, this new biographical story was always going to attract the very best talent and it has been claimed that Kate Winslet actually went after the role of Joanna Hoffman because of Boyle and Sorkin's involvement in the production. Boyle and Sorkin have given the audience more of a biopic of Steve Jobs soul rather than his life and it is this direction that immediately fixates the viewer and pulls them into the story.<br/><br/>The film is simply told in three parts, all of which revolve around a highly anticipated launch of one of Steve Jobs ground breaking technological inventions. Each launch focuses on the man's tortured mind, the darkness of his soul and the flaws in his personality. Michael Fassbender is magnificent as the very unlikable Jobs, expertly sliding into his role with all the creative talent of a seasoned professional. Without Fassbender's engrossing performance 'Steve Jobs' would have been just like its predecessor........an awful mess. He completely encases the spirit of Steve Jobs with all the complexities of the character. Although Jobs comes across as a demanding disliked sociopath, Fassbender is good enough to get an emotional response from the audience. ""I'm just not well made."" It's this comment to his daughter that thoroughly encapsulates this difficult man.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet is already receiving high praise for her role as Jobs long suffering right hand woman, Joanna Hoffman. There is very little that Winslet can't do and she again attacks this outstanding role like it was her very first. Jeff Daniels is returning to grittier roles and puts in a solid effort as the Chairman of Apple, John Sculley but the biggest surprise comes from Seth Rogan in his role as Steve Wozniak. Rogan knows he can't match it with Fassbender and doesn't have to with his appearances well timed and full of quality.<br/><br/>'Steve Jobs' may not be factually correct and fails to tell the complete tale of this iconic man but it goes right to the heart of Jobs' soul and the result is a tremendously layered narrative of how and why this man worked the way he worked. Jobs' relationship with the people that were closest to him are put right out on display for the viewer to consume and it is up to the individual on how they receive such a film."

","Steve Jobs is a character study of the genius man. And like Jobs himself, the movie is a complex yet heartfelt dramatization of three different stages of his life. All scenes were set backstage during different product launches divided in three parts. It's a film that doesn't rely heavily on actions, but rather on confrontations. It relies mostly on Aaron Sorkin's soaring screenplay, that man is a genius himself. Firing words from here and there and extending the tension between two persons, it's like seeing a real argument or a debate, where one loses and the other triumphs! Of course, most of the time it's Jobs who succeeds.<br/><br/>Full review here: http://notimeforbadfilms.blogspot.com/2016/02/steve- jobs.html"

It's a huge emotional torrent that carries away anyone, that makes 2 hours seem like 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Anyone who has experiences of living/interacting with a single-parent child understands how true and universal the troubled Lisa Brennan-Jobs' story is.<br/><br/>Anyone with an entrepreneurial heart could rhyme with what's depicted about Jobs.<br/><br/>Personally I wish Fassbender's acting could still be better, to the height of Christian Bale in The Big Short.

"abouhelier-r","9","0","1","6 February 2016"," Steve Jobs
","Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution, to a paint of the man at its epicentre. The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac.<br/><br/>This movie establishes as the only Steve Jobs movie the broader public will really need or want to see, offering a richly unconventional take on the life of an American visionary. For those who believed that the late co-founder of Apple was both an iconic visionary and a monster with a stone where his heart should be, rest assured that writer, director and star Michael Fassbender have given their subject the brilliant, ingeniously designed and monstrously self aggrandising movie he deserves. The question this film answers is why? Why Steve Jobs is that way? Why he sees the world that way? Why does he do the things he does? And unfortunately we don't often get that sort of answers in movies. That is why this new take on Jobs' life is quite interesting. A smart film driven by dialogues and great moments that allow the actors to shine. <br/><br/>In the first act alone, the film establishes core aspects of Jobs' personal and professional identity that will be further advanced and imaginatively set in the next two segments. Plus, the movie emotional core comes from Steve relationship and family life. Though sometimes the presence of ex and child Lisa seems pretty unrealistic and even forced. We witness firsthand his impossible perfectionism and refusal to take no for an answer. Jobs' gift for innovation was perhaps inextricable from his capacity for cruelty. The puppet master who kept all around him on strings. The impresario of a circus dedicated to the creation and dramatic unveiling of technological wonders that changed the world. More importantly, this film explores Steve Jobs and who he was as a person: it doesn't wildly explores his life but more his inner life. <br/><br/>Moreover, hardly any of this would matter without a dynamic actor at the centre of things, nailing the part of Jobs. Michael Fassbender fully delivers the essentials of how we can perceive the man: intellectual brilliance, force of personality and power to inspire. Both Christian Bale and Leonardo DiCaprio were once embarked for this role, but it's hard to imagine either of them matching Fassbender's capacity to engage and repel at the same time. He knows exactly how to toss the writer's dialogue and delivers a performance so deep that it's impossible to take your eyes off him. His on screen presence at every minute makes it all the better. <br/><br/>Danny Boyle wasn't an automatic fit for the material. However, it's his best film in years. Here he made a very straightforward movie, compared to his usual style he pulled back a little this time. One of the major positive part of this film is the choice Boyle made to film the first act of 1984, in 16 mm film and as time progresses to 1988, the second act is in 35 mm, to finally shot the last act of 1998 on digital so that it gives the movie a genuine tangible feeling of technological progression. The film's face is evolving with its products. The script is written by Aaron Sorkin who is in my opinion one of the best screenwriter of our time, he wrote The Social Network, A Few Good Men and created the series The Newsroom: this man is a genius regards to writing. Blowing away traditional storytelling conventions, Sorkin's screenplay has mastered the art of conveying a character's essence. Not by delivering the most comprehensive account possible (Pixar, Xerox and cancer are just topics that go unmentioned), but by compressing the most relevant topics into one significant time frame. Rather three time frames, each one centred around the public launch of a Jobs-created product that would change the course of his career and thus the course of global technology. <br/><br/>Overall, Steve Jobs has a boldly theatrical three act-structure, tightly choreographed narratives and visually clean lines. The dominance of Aaron Sorkin's script and focus on business mean this film will mostly appeal the Apple geek. Filled with amazing performances for a dialogue driven film, this film is the perfect synthesis of writing, performance and direction."
"Screen_Blitz","7","0","1","5 February 2016"," A solid portrayal of Steve Jobs
","From the amazing director Danny Boyle and writer Aaron Sorkin who wrote 'The Social Network', comes a biopic based on Walter Isaacson's biographical novel of the late founder of Apple, one of the largest running business's in the world. This marks the second attempt to bring the story of the titular character, with the first being the 2013 film 'Jobs' starring Ashton Kutcher. Told in a three- act structure, this film stars Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs and follows the early years of his work that brought birth to a new age of digital technology, from the iconic launch of the 1984 Macintosh, to the launch of the 1986 NeXT computer (now defunct), to the release of the 1998 iMac computer. While this man was responsible to creating some of the biggest technological products in the world, his passion for this work lead to troubling relationships with his daughter Lisa who he denied paternity to, his best friend and co- founder Steve Wozniak (played by Seth Rogen), as well as his colleagues . Kate Winslet takes on the role as marketing executive Joanna Hoffman, and Jeff Daniels plays John Sculley who took over Apple as CEO after Jobs' outing. <br/><br/>Danny Boyle and writer Aaron Sorkin give this film the most effective portrayal of Apple's late founder yet. Michael Fassbender gives such a vibrant performance as the titular character and soars so natural in his role, despite showing modest resemblance of Jobs in appearance, and his performance efficiently captured the callousness of Jobs' personality. What comes to more surprise is the portrayal of co- founder Steve Wozniak who shines with a striking performance by Seth Rogen who breaks his comedic typecasting. And let's not forget the charismatic presence of Kate Winslet who remains fresh as ever. Unlike the previous Steve Jobs biopic from 2013, this one takes a more artistic fashion of portraying the story backstage of Jobs' career with Apple and the now defunct company NeXT with pure energy. As the story focuses more on his personal relationships with his family and colleagues than the inside look at his work, which does detract the film of some the biographical touch, the story is told in a very dramatized manner. Every scene consisting of plenty of talking feels so fast paced, especially as these scenes are filmed in real-time. The conversation between the characters are quite gripping and never feel dull, though those expecting a more fact-based storytelling may be slightly disappointed. The most inspiring aspect of these however, is how the cinematography, with each act of the film shot in various formats to present a visual reflection of the time period in which each takes place. <br/><br/>Steve Jobs is solid piece of entertainment by Danny Boyle and probably the most effective and powerful portrayal of the late Steve Jobs ever put to screen. This is a very entertaining film with mesmerizing performances from a talented cast; a great, though flawed direction, and a sharp screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. It is just a shame that this film suffered miserably at the box office, this film deserves more attention than what it has received so far."
"Solnichka","10","0","1","4 February 2016"," Another biopic about an American jerk, but it works
","I'm revising this review after a second viewing, as Jobs' personality is so repulsive, you can't help but be shocked by the content of the film. However, Sorkin's writing and the key actors in the film make this a very enjoyable examination of a modern ""god"" ... even if you don't respect Jobs much for his egomaniacal personality that alienated so many people. The cinematography is excellent as is the accompanying music/soundtrack. All in all, it's a fine piece of art, with almost non-stop, engaging dialogue that makes you think far beyond the main character. The end is a tear- jerking conclusion that offers some hope for the main character's moral redemption.This belongs right up there with _The Social Network_, in truth, leaving us to wonder when the Google film from Sorkin's keyboard will arrive next to complete the Holy Trinity of Silicon Valley."

It is just superbly performed.<br/><br/>This review is all about the plot and more about the editing.<br/><br/>Before I go on, this contains spoilers and I hope this will not be deleted just like my take on ""the Force Awakens"".<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the product launches that changed the consumer expectation by Jobs, and the film shows us just about the ""casp"" of each product launch with a brilliant mixture of Jobs' relation with his daughter and his ""work-wife"". It all revolves around Jobs' emotional unavailability as a father, friend, boyfriend, and his attitudes as a boss and a flawed human being. and not about the birth and death of a human being. The better the product gets, the better Jobs gets.<br/><br/>The editing is, however, just phenomenal. One of the best in the past two decades along with ""Birdman"". The movie captures your curiosity and mixes it with his passion for his job. Especially, the scenes with Fassbender and Daniels are performed and far more strengthened with editing. No extravaganza. no dramatic overdose.<br/><br/>Do not watch this movie for the secret of Jobs' wisdom but to see how unavailable a person can be for natural human connection, and his preference for available substitute in ""end-to-end"" controlled machinery."

","Michael Fassbender's performance as Steve Jobs deserve Oscar. He's relentless, imitating every habit Jobs carries. ""Steve Jobs"" isn't the greatest movie in the world, yet I guess it's a watchable biography type picture which indeed showcases a man who has both struggles life and job wise. Instead of dramatizing the crucial moments of Jobs' life, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin splits the film into three sections: 1984 (Mac), 1988 (NeXT), and 1998 (iMac). You'd think that a movie that's just 3 long scenes would be boring, but the film has so much energy and intensity. Danny Boyle's dizzyingly surreal style adds greatly to the wonder of the story. I highly recommend it."
"jboothmillard","7","0","3","28 January 2016"," Steve Jobs
","Directed by Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours), I heard mixed opinions about this film during its release, with cinemas even stopping performances due to lack of interest, but critics did give it good reviews, I became much more interest when award nominations came rolling in. Basically this film focuses on three key events in the life of Steve Jobs (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Michael Fassbender), the information technology entrepreneur, inventor, and co-founder, chairman, and chief executive officer (CEO) of Apple Inc., the company that has created many of the world's greatest products and largest cultural ramifications, including: the iMac, iTunes, Apple Stores, the iPod, the iTunes Store, the iPhone, the App Store, and the iPad, and Jobs funded The Graphics Group, now known all over the world as animation studio Pixar. The first event is the 1984 unveiling of the Macintosh 128k, Apple co-founder Jobs demands engineer Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) fix the failure of the machine's demo voice, threatening public humiliation in the presentation. Meanwhile he has an argument with marketing executive Joanna Hoffman (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Kate Winslet) about the Time magazine article exposing his dispute with ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston) about the paternity of her five-year- old daughter Lisa (Makenzie Moss), Jobs denies he is the father. Chrisann shows up with Lisa, she confronts Jobs about his denial and his refusal to support her despite his wealth, Jobs and Lisa bond when he lets her use a computer and she creates a MacPaint artwork, and he agrees to provide more money and buy her a house. Jobs feels it is unwise to mention an ageing computer when Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) asks him to acknowledge the Apple II team in the presentation, and Jobs and Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) discuss Job's life as an adoptive child, he admits being given up gave him feelings of powerlessness and now gives him a need for control. The second event is the 1988 launch of the NeXT computer, at the War Memorial Opera House, the Macintosh failed and NeXt is the new company founded by Jobs, his relationship with Brennan is still strained, he accuses her of irresponsible behaviour and using now nine-year-old Lisa (Ripley Sobo) to get money from him, but he is able to spend time with Lisa. Wozniak arrives and predicts the NeXt will be another failure, Jobs confronts him about his public criticism of him, and Wozniak questions how Jobs has contributed to computing history, Jobs refers to himself as a conductor, directing ""musicians"", like Wozniak. Sculley demands to know why Jobs was fired from Apple, actually he was forced out by the Apple board after, despite Sculley's warnings, he continued to defend the Macintosh, after its discontinuation, and Hoffman realises that the reason behind the unclear direction of NeXt, the computer has been designed by Jobs to entice Apple into buying his company and reinstating him. The third event is the 1998 unveiling of the iMac G3, at Davies Symphony Hall, Apple have fired Sculley, purchased NeXT, and Jobs is now CEO, Hoffman has projected strong commercial forecasts and Jobs is delighted. However Jobs is furious when now nineteen-year- old Lisa (Perla Haney-Jardine) has allowed her mother Chrisann to sell the house he bought for them, Hoffman reminds Jobs he threatened to withhold Lisa's college tuition, and he stunned when Hertzfeld admits he paid the tuition and suggested she attend therapy. Wozniak shows up again and asks Jobs to credit the Apple II team during his presentation, he again refuses, Sculley secretly turns also and they make amends, Hoffman urges Jobs to apologise for his mistakes to Lisa, he does so and says he is ""poorly made"", he gives his daughter a printed copy of the MacPaint artwork she created in 1984, and Lisa watches her father take to the stage to introduce the iMac to the world. Also starring Sarah Snook as Andrea Cunningham, Adam Shapiro as Avie Tevanian, John Ortiz as Joel Pforzheimer, Stan Roth as George Coates and John Steen as Mike Markkula. Fassbender only just looks a bit like Jobs, it doesn't matter, he is terrific playing the demanding, single-minded perfectionist, Winslet gets many equally great moments as the attentive marketing executive who has all the numbers and wants to help Jobs stick to schedule, but also sort himself out, there is also good support from Rogen and Daniels. This is an unusual biopic, normally you would focus on many of the key moments in a real person's career and personal life, but on the other hand this makes use of a very well written script, shifting away from the noteworthy achievements of the famous man, and seeing situations unfolding in real time, it is an interesting biographical drama. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Adapted Screenplay for Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men, The West Wing, The Social Network), and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Original Score for Daniel Pemberton. Very good!"

","This movie is on fire! The energy every scene beams from the screen in unbelievable. This is one of those films where you don't have time to stop and think and were at that point you realize ""man, I am watching a real movie"".<br/><br/>I mean, you are thrown right into the action from frame one and it takes you ten minutes to realize the train that just hit you. I clearly remember stopping for a second in the theater after the first ten minutes had passed and looking around and realizing what a flawless piece of acting and dialogue I was watching. It was something unlike anything I had ever experienced, to realize what Fassbender and Winslet were doing.<br/><br/>I am telling you these performances are gems of acting. The two of them give both one of those performances that makes you remember why you fall in love with cinema in the first place. Alongside Rooney Mara in Carol this is the best acting there's been in a film all year. And it is true, essential acting, not DiCaprio acting. This is where both the actor and the acting disappear and there is only the character left on screen and it is a marvel to look at. The supporting cast is also amazingly good and when elevated by the leads it makes for some real, palpable authenticity on screen.<br/><br/>Yet, nothing of this could be possible if, of course, in first place Sorkin wasn't such a good, intelligent, brilliant writer that understands screen writing in the most unique yet fascinating way, but even more so the genius of Danny Boyle. He directs this film to perfection. It could be really easy to overdo things and meddle with them, resulting in an unbalanced result. But Boyle is just too good for it, he know the power of the screenplay and doesn't invade it, but thanks to some very subtle work he manages to elevate it and energize it even more. He really is a fantastic, visual storyteller, who by the way also makes a use of sound and music, breathtaking here. Fantastic score.<br/><br/>And curiously enough I have realized that I haven't even yet mentioned anything about Steve Jobs himself or the true story aspect, and that is probably the movie's greatest triumph. It does ""true story"" possibly the most right it could ever reach. it understands a film is a film and it is meant to be a narrative piece of drama or comedy and it nails that. It is a film about characters and emotions that just happens to be a true story and it uses that as a background, as a support, as a subtle mean of storytelling, which is how it should be used because it definitely is the most effective it can be, not when it is in the foreground, shoving emotions down your throat and banging you over the head with messages of morality.<br/><br/>The film unfortunately does have its own limitations and even acknowledges them. The three act structure it uses totally worked for me and I wouldn't change a thing about it, but it did make it possible for the thematic underscore of the film to be absorbed in all of its facets on the first viewing. I might change idea when I check it out again.<br/><br/>This is some the very best cinema 2015 offered us, I am truly saddened that not enough people have seen this. On Oscar night, even though I don't care that much, I will be rooting for Winslet and especially Fassbender, he is the greatest actor I can think of right now, I adore his craft to death."

","Steve Jobs (2015)<br/><br/>The third movie, since his death in 2011, which takes both name and inspiration from the late co-founder and CEO of Apple inc. Steve Jobs. (and no, that's not even counting documentaries, TV movies or series.) The difference this time; it's actually pretty good. Directed by Danny Boyle, the film explores the personality of Jobs through the events that take place backstage at three product launches over a span of fourteen years from 1984 to 1998.<br/><br/>The masterfully written screenplay from Aaron Sorkin is brought to life by the brilliant cast including Michael Fassbender in the titular role, nominated for best actor and rightfully so, Kate Winslet who brings both wisdom and humour in her banter with Jobs, Seth Rogen who thankfully turns the humour down to a two and the acting up to a ten, and Jeff Daniels who's all too short scenes were a personal highpoint for the movie.<br/><br/>The film itself is very wordy. If you know of Sorkin's work, you'll know what I mean (yes hallways, yes arguments yes clever witty dialogue). This is not a film where much happens, it's a film built on interaction between characters and you'll need to prepare for that if you're expecting sh*t to go down, because it doesn't. They talk and they talk, and the talking is great, but if the acting and writing isn't enough to entertain you, if you came for the car chases and the gunfights, you came to the wrong place.<br/><br/>However, my primary issue with the film lies in the following; at about the eighty minute mark, after we've seen the first two acts of the film, first off, we know the structure of the movie now, we know how the rest is going to play out, we know he's going to have to talk to Hertzfeld, we know he'll talk to Woz, oh and where's Jeff Daniels? There he is, just in time. It became too convenient for the story and a little predictable which I was disappointed with. Secondly, the entire movie is a setup, a build towards three product announcements, and when the film keeps building and resetting, building and resetting, it can get somewhat exhausting, especially with a two-hour-plus runtime. I just didn't feel that ""YES!"" moment I wanted to feel at the end.<br/><br/>That being said, the film isn't about the products, it's about the man behind them, and by the end I really did get a sense of who this guy was and what drove him. (like, I've always had a grudge against apple because their devices are, as they say, ""closed end-to-end"" which they address in the movie and which I found very interesting.) I felt like all of the characters were perfectly interesting, but I would have liked to have seen them wrapped up in a more interesting narrative.<br/><br/>The film is shot on 16mm, 35mm and in digital and changes as we progress through time, an interesting and appropriate choice, so don't be worried if you sit down and it looks like you're watching television from the 80's. The score is enthralling and enhances the story in just the right way, particularly in one scene between Fassbender and Daniels which mashes up multiple conversations using exceptional editing. (This was the ""YES!"" moment I was looking for.)<br/><br/>In the end, Steve Jobs is a great movie that unfortunately just isn't as enjoyable as it is good. Imagine your favourite movie trilogy, now take the best 40 minutes of each movie and put them together as one. It's still good, just not the same, it's missing that connective tissue that if added would make it perfect.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs: 7.2/10"
"petergrump1","8","0","1","27 January 2016"," The Reveal
","Disclaimer: This review does not reflect opinions on the man Steve Jobs, but the 2015 Film and for the purposes of this review it is better to think of him as a fictional character as the film has come under lots of fire for not being historically accurate. <br/><br/>Around the middle of the film, Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) looks at various portraits of great leaders as his face fades out and Napoleon's fades in. This is the perfect summary of the film's portrayal of him. The film directed by Danny Boyle ( Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire) and written by Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing, A Few Good Men) has been a combination that many people have been looking forward to in this film. Just as many people anticipated it feels similar to Sorkin's The Social Network in that it attempts to show what a man is truly like behind the public image that he creates.<br/><br/>The film is separated into three acts and each act is a different product launch that Jobs is involved in. The entire act is the short time before the launch (it appears to be in real time, but it is hard to tell sometimes since they don't give exact times). Each of these acts also reflect a large time in Job's life. The first launch is that of the Macintosh in 1984 when Apple had become a brand name and a very successful company with Jobs as the co-founder. The second launch is that of the NeXT computer in 1988 that Jobs created after he was fired from Apple. The third and final launch was that of the iMac in 1998. Each launch also has flashbacks to Jobs earlier life and the events that lead to the that launch. For Example, in the first launch there is a flashback to Steve Jobs and his friend Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) inventing a computer in their garage. Each launch also has key interactions with four people in Jobs's life: Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) who is Apple's marketing executive, John Sculley ( Jeff Daniels) who is Apple's CEO from 1983-1993, Steve Wozniak who is Apple's co-founder with Jobs and Lisa Brennan- Jobs (Perla Haney-Jardine, Ripley Sobo, and Makenzie Moss) who is Job's daughter.<br/><br/>All these people and their motivations for being in Job's life could be discussed in length, but it would be frivolous as these people serve as nothing more than tools used to create a portrait of Jobs's character. At every turn he can Jobs is condescending, arrogant, spiteful and just downright mean. He constantly refers to himself as an artist and quotes the bible when speaking about himself. Before every launch he puts up pictures of great men , many of which have nothing to do with computing. This portrayal of Jobs's is very interesting in that the film always cuts before the launch. Each launch was televised in its time and can be seen. However, the film only shows what happens before each launch giving the audience a sense that we are watching Steve Jobs behind the camera. While in much of the film, Jobs's remains arrogant and condescending there are several scenes sprinkled in the film where his shell cracks and signs of a man who only wants the best for his daughter are evident. The film is merely a frame for its main character, a napoleonic figure who slowly gets off his high horse. Since the film only takes place at product launches, many of the scenes are interiors so for the film to work the scenes to work the cinematography has to make these places look living and vibrant. It accomplishes this with flying colors. The cinematography is stunning in making mundane places seem almost holy. These interiors almost seem to be the kingdom of Jobs. Places he wishes to rule over in an authoritarian manner, sharing the power with nobody, and the halls ringing with portraits of great men only add to that effect. Then, when we are left alone with Jobs the cinematography becomes very personal and shows a man who is beginning to crack under the facade he has created for himself. <br/><br/>Steve Jobs is something new and original in the way it tells its story, but it becomes trivial since the film has no other purpose than to show the man Steve Jobs was. Even if it takes large liberties in source material, it is a must-watch for anybody who is interested in men of power."

","So I've finally got a chance to watch ""Steve Jobs"" over the weekend and I thought it was pretty good. Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet both gave a terrific performance, as the chemistry between the two was convincing and enjoyable to watch. The writing and the directing is this movies biggest strength, because the movie is non- stop talking and that's what this movie really is, and I know this isn't going to be for everyone, but for me, I was engaged all the way through and I honestly can't recall being bored while watching the movie. My biggest praise that I have for this movie has to go to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin, because filming and writing a movie like this isn't easy (trust me). <br/><br/>The problems I have for the movie are very small and many people wouldn't be bothered by this, but this is just me. The little kid actor in the movie (Who plays Steve Jobs young daughter) she wasn't bad, as I thought she did alright for the most part, but there were a few times when I noticed some slip ups. But that's just a mini problem and the rest of the performances from everyone was great.<br/><br/>Overall Steve Jobs is a well made film with clever writing, outstanding acting and directing. It's a shame that this movie was pulled from many theaters because nobody wanted to see it. Jem and the Holograms and Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension, both sh*t movies that managed to stay in cinemas, but this movie didn't."
"bimpsonbimpson","9","0","2","22 January 2016"," One of the best of the year
","Steve Jobs is directed by Danny Boyle, written by Aaron Sorkin and starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogan and Jeff Daniels. It is based on Steve Jobs who we all know was the CEO of Apple, the film is set before three of Steve's most iconic product launches including the Macintosh, the Next and the iMac.<br/><br/>When the trailer first came out for this film people criticised it purely for the fact that it was about Steve Jobs, I personally thought it was captivating and it looked to be an intense and well done drama. With both Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin attached as writer and director my expectations grew until I finally got to see it as part of the London Film Festival.<br/><br/>Did it live up to my expectations? Let me just say that Michael Fassbender has starred in the two best films of the year, this and Macbeth. I was absolutely captivated throughout it's entire two hour run time.<br/><br/>Each shot looked beautiful with stunning cinematography and lighting, I could randomly pull out a still from this film and it would look amazing 98% of the time. The shots didn't consist of close ups and establishing shots like most films do, I really loved the use of reflections and mirrors, there were also plenty of long takes which must have been incredibly difficult to pull off with the amount of dialogue the actors had to say.<br/><br/>On the note of dialogue, Aaron Sorkin's screenplay was astounding, each line felt carefully written and stringed together creating convincing and utterly fantastic writing. The arguments of which there are plenty of absolutely blew me away, a couple of scenes in particular bringing me to tears of joy. This film made me cry not just from the raw emotion from the several conflicts Steve was in the center of but just because of how amazing it was, extremely complex scenes of powerful acting and writing all expertly shot had me stunned and I just felt my eyes begin to water from the film's pure excellence. Even though most of the script consisted of very serious and dramatic dialogue that doesn't mean there was no humour. It was a strange feeling after being thrust between these breathtaking conflicts to suddenly find yourself laughing. Few films have shifted emotions so seamlessly like this film did, and the humour didn't feel out of place either which is the case with many other pictures like this.<br/><br/>Each and every performance was astounding, even the child performances where emotional and convincing, the adult actors even more so. These actors had to remember pages of complex dialogue and deliver it with such raw emotion and I applaud them for it because it was so entertaining to watch. Each character was interesting and unique all with their own distinct goals and personalities<br/><br/>The score by Daniel Pemberton supplemented this film fantastically ranging from simple electronic beats to complex orchestrated tracks that added tension boosted the impact of many scenes. You often have scores that just morph into the background without doing anything more than just adding more sound to the film, scores like these really stand out to me while I am watching the film, I can imagine this film without its music would be nowhere near as tense and gripping as it was.<br/><br/>Overall 'Steve Jobs' was captivating, beautiful and an intense dramatic ride which will have you on the edge of your seat more than most action films. The score was brilliant and the dialogue a triumph of writing, made even better with raw emotional performances from a superb cast. Sheer brilliance which will have tears of pure joy running down your face, this is one of the best films of the year so far just behind Macbeth. Even if you hate Apple, as long as you are a lover of cinema you will enjoy this film because in the end it wasn't pro or anti Apple/Steve Jobs, you it didn't tell you how to think you got to judge for yourself and that's what makes films like this so great. Turley a masterpiece."

","Such an intelligent, innovative man with an incredible story. ""Steve Jobs"" was an amazing film! I loved so many aspects of it from the acting to the wardrobe. Kate Winslet gave a performance well-deserving of her recent Golden Globe win. She really transformed into Joanna Hoffman so well. With help from the writing and wardrobe, I really found myself lost in the time period, completely forgetting we're in 2016! A man I knew little about besides that he was the brains behind Apple, this film created such a great insight into his personal life. I completely connected with his struggle with having to sacrifice people and relationships in his life in order to reach success. Michael Fassbender played this role so well and I was equally as pleased with the writing and directing of course, from the incredibly talented Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin. Definitely a must-see film!"
"ctowyi","7","0","1","18 January 2016"," I am not sure if it is about the man but I am sure it is about the tranny of a mad genius
","Steve Jobs, the film feels like a steroid-addled mess but somewhere in its epicenter of chaos actually lies coherence. Forget about your usual biopic narrative structure, Aaron Sorkin's screenplay can't be bothered with that. Three moments are distilled from his Apple years and we get to look behind the stage during product launches in 1984, 1988 and 1998. The products unveiled are the Macintosh, the NeXT Black Cube and the iMac respectively. Those who are observant will notice that Danny Boyle uses different film formats to reflect the different pivotal periods - 16mm, 35mm and digital respectively. The three moments are essentially the traditional Hollywood three acts but it doesn't possess a cinematic feel. Boyle and Sorkin went for a theatrical feel and the ensemble cast is solid. Fassbender, Winslet and Rogen and Daniels are so good that I couldn't see another actor in the role. It's a jaw-dropping marvel to look at Fassbender playing a maestro that tries so hard to be the most hated man in the office and a man who wants the final word in any discussion. <br/><br/>From the start to its end, the movie feels like it is going for a delirious high. It doesn't want to romanticize the man. If it is romanticizing something, I think it was celebrating the tranny of monster mad genius. I have a feeling nothing much in the movie is true and Jobs is just a canvas for Aaron Sorkin to work his usual porn. By porn I mean fleet-footed dialogue and repartee firing on all cylinders. Danny Boyle just takes the script and runs with the fifth gear with full-on acceleration. The pace is relentless, even faster than Mad Max. Forget all you know about biopics and enjoy the full-throttle ride. <br/><br/>I have a feeling the movie is very divisive - you will either love it or hate it. I love it but my wifey not so."

","I guess it helps I never saw the other panned JOBS movie. But, it hurt the world and I didn't care about the man or mac.<br/><br/>See, I've never been an Apple guy. I *had* to use them in the newsroom in college because that's what they had and before that, I do recall using the Apple IIe in Grammar School. When I was able to purchase, or have purchased/made for me, I chose the IBM or anything-but an Apple product. Today is no different.<br/><br/>So, when the first JOBS movie opened, I didn't care to see it. And when it was severely panned, all the more reason to avoid it. I heard about the second attempt at a film about Jobs and rolled my eyes, as most of America did. Yes, I heard it was praised and then became part of history with a couple of Oscar nods. Since I watch all the Oscar main nominations, finally I had to see it.<br/><br/>I think we were all wrong. This is a very good movie with two fantastic and well-deserved nominee performances.<br/><br/>Completely original and tight, the great director, Danny Boyle takes only three aspects of Jobs' life to spin his tale of ""always being right."" Minutes before three of his huge presentation/launches from the 80s to 90s are shown to give us most of what happened in between.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender has always been great and here, he really shines once again. Sadly, I never knew the real Steve Jobs, or seen him in any video other than ones that parodied him. And at first, I didn't recognize Kate Winslet and she was good as always. Not her best, but damn well had me rooting for her. All the supporting cast was good as well.<br/><br/>Too bad this movie was overlooked because of the hate on the fairly recent JOBS fiasco. Boyle did an excellent, ah-hem, job here and it really should be seen. Even if you're not a fan like I'm not, the screenplay alone is fast and fun. Totally worth it.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: I'm probably gonna get sued by the Jobs estate, but when I was a kid and we couldn't afford either an IBM or Mac, I was gifted a Radio Shack 16k Color Computer II where I programmed my own AppleWorks software we used in school. See, we couldn't afford software either, so it was up to me to make my own and I *loved* the AppleWorks program. So, I learned basic programming and created: CocoWorks (Coco being the nickname for the Color Computer from Radio Shack.) It had the three main components from AppleWorks: a word processor, a database and a spreadsheet. Or, what we call today: Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. It was fully functional and I was thoroughly proud of it. Maybe someday I can find that program I made or at least a print out from it. I miss doing those programs."

","I am about to launch my review of the biopic film ""Steve Jobs"" on the revolutionary computer mogul. But the pun pressure is on, I don't know if I will be able to have a Pun Mac attack with my review of Director Danny Boyle's inventive but at times unauthentic movie. Don't get me wrong, the film is not filled with rotten apples of filmmaking. Boyle takes an unusual approach in setting the film in three different time eras of Jobs about to launch his latest product designs: the Mac, NEXT, and the IMac; obviously, the latter did not do too shabby. I credit Boyle for this distinct approach, but I doubt how much authenticity was involved in what transpired in those launches. In the three launches, Jobs interacts with longtime marketing director/right-hand woman Joanna Hoffman, longtime upstart partner Steve Wozniak, Apple CEO/Surrogate Father Figure John Sculley and others; all while dealing with a paternal responsibility with at first he denied. Michael Fassbender fascinates once again; this time with his fervent & magnificent performance as Jobs. Seth Rogen has never been better with his dramatic programmed work as Wozniak, Jeff Daniels was his most-of-the-time usual steady self as Sculley, and Kate Winslet was impressive as Hoffman. Acclaimed screenwriter Aaron Sorkin did provide some words of entrepreneur & arrogance wisdom (sort of computer speak) with his ""Steve Jobs"" script; but as he did with Zuckerberg, he did not articulate a pretty picture of Jobs by focusing a bit more on his arrogance. Sure it was unorthodox, but ""Steve Jobs"" did the job for the most part and computes as a worthy film in my book. **** Good"
"hirambcr","9","0","2","12 January 2016"," A Genius Mind Behind A Genius Line of Products
","""Steve Jobs"" is definitely one of the best biographical films of our time. It makes a very particular right, efficient, dynamic, neurotic, great, funny, human and unforgettable ""portrait in motion"" of one of the most complex characters and iconographic twentieth century celebrities and geniuses: ""Steve Jobs"", aka the co-creator of the personal computer practically and/or a series of creations or co-creations more in Apple Computer Company that if not exist, the world would not be the same. Danny Boyle's British director in his frantic, unstoppable filmstyle does convey much of what lay behind this great character who taught the world to ""think different"", using a very intelligent fastpace screenplay by Aaron Sorkin, based on the great biobook of Walter Isaacson, that itself is a great biography ""pre-authorized"" of Steve Jobs, and I do recommend it. Boyle and his writer staged his film at the times backstage or behind the scenes of the official presentations/summits of three unforgettable and key Apple products. It is in these peak moments where Steve Jobs, masterfully played by Michael Fassbender, comes out with all its complex load of feelings, thoughts, obsessions, fears and tricks. It is in these moments where Steve Jobs has to show the world that he is the ""Director of the Big Orchestra"" without sometimes having to play any instrument at all. Behind every great man is a great woman and this is certainly Jobs's personal assistant, played with intensity by Kate Winslet and all the memorable interactions with key figures of the protagonist's life as the girlfriend/wife or his daughter, his co-founder Steve Wozniak and his uncomftrable partner John Scully, a very complex character and influence in Steve's life. All is setup in a frenetic and kinetic pace from start to finish in a film that does not let you breathe literally, it has so much to teach to us and without a question puts Steve Jobs as an essential reference for anyone who wants to venture into this modern era and learn about the 20th century cyber modern history and biography of this unforgettable genius, or wants to learn in latter case how it is created, raised, almost destroyed and saves a world-class company. Steve Jobs should be seen and applauded not one but in several revisions. A must see film."
"dromasca","8","0","2","11 January 2016"," Jobs as father
","The second film in the mini-festival of Steve Jobs movies that I enjoyed last Friday was also the better one. Danny Boyle, the director of Trainspotting, Sunshine, and Slumdog Millionaire may have hit gold again, as his Steve Jobs started to collect awards at the Golden Globe ceremony last night, and Michael Fassbender became lead contender to the magic statuette to be awarded for Best Actor on February 28. What is the secret? <br/><br/>The film based on a script by Aaron Sorkin (who also brought to screen the character of Facebook's Zuckerberg) is very different from the other biopic ('Jobs') or from the documentaries dedicated to the man and the entrepreneur who was Jobs. It catches three half-hours prior to three major announcements in the career of Jobs, but does not deal almost at all with the technicalities - they deal with the atmosphere (ordered chaos we can call it), with the encounters of Jobs with people who are close to him - his technical partner Wozniak, his business partner John Sculley, and especially his estrange wife and his daughter, whom initially he refused to recognize in one of these attitudes who built his negative perception as a father and human in the eyes of the public. The situations repeat and escalate, but the relationship with his daughter provide the missing human dimension. We may not understand more of the hi-tech genius of Jobs, but we gain more understanding about the man and father he was.<br/><br/>Besides the smart script, acting is the second winning card that makes 'Steve Jobs' the better Jobs film. Michael Fassbender avoids replicating the physical characteristics of Steve Jobs and focuses on his personal life and the relations with his partners and close ones (as close as he let them be). Kate Winslet builds the character of Joanna Hoffman who was the right-hand of Jobs but gets a much more extended role than she played in reality. You may not recognize her at first sight, as this role is pretty far from her usual gallery. A Globe is hers already, other awards may follow.<br/><br/>By focusing on a specific segment of Jobs' personality this movie succeeded to give a better view of the whole. Yet, it's only one facet of a huge personality that remains from many other points of view an enigma, and maybe character for more movies."

This movie was GREAT! I had a blast! Let's be fair here, what makes this movie is the clever dialogues and performances. It's all talking and thinking, there's nothing blowing up in this one. It's not gonna be everybody's cup of tea, but if you are already interested in it just by reading this, well, you're in for a treat. Micheal Fassbender was flawless, loved Seth Rogen's Steve Wozniak, Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels, they were all superb. The dialogues were gripping, real, and meaningful. My only nit-pick would be the directing of Danny Boyle, I felt like it was kind off out of place at times, with his artistic involvement. It felt more like a movie for David Fincher to direct, as he is more sterile and calculated, which would be more fitting for a Steve Jobs movie. The very unique narrative structure (cutting the first, second and third act into the behind- the-scenes of the conferences) was a smart decision, it made the pacing smooth, enjoyable and unique. By the end, I just wanted more of this movie which is saying something. But, honestly, I can't see what this film would have been without Aaron Sorkin's script, he made the movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>8.5/10 for ""Steve Jobs""(2015) :-)"

And he worked very hard for Jobs. He was even hospitalized while preparing for the role.<br/><br/>This movie has it all...Great score, good editing, phenomenal acting by everyone except maybe Seth Rogen (he seemed okay as Wozniak), and manages to touch your heart.

","I liked the movie ""Steve Jobs"" very much, although it is definitely not a movie for everyone.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender plays the leading role (Steve Jobs) and delivers the best performance of his acting career. Aaron Sorkin proves once again that he is one of the best writers in the movie business because of his beautiful dialogs. I absolutely love his works (i.e. Moneyball, The Social Network and many others). Similar to ""The Social Network"" the plot switches between times to illustrate different passages of the character's life. The movie is divided in 3 acts and is set in 1984, 1988 and 1998. The supporting cast is great, too. Kate Winslet is simply gorgeous and Seth Rogen surprised me positively. Famous director Danny Boyle tried to achieve something similar that the director of Birdman (2014) attempted. We follow the main character step by step without anything being left out. I liked the idea and it was well-implemented. The movie score is very decent as well.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed every second of this movie, even though it is ""different"" than the casual movies you watch. I can understand if people don't like it since the structure is quite unusual. However, I believe Aaron Sorkin, Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet will be among the favorites for their respective categories in this year's Academy Awards."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","3","28 December 2015"," Less An Adaptation & More A Work Of Fiction. Still, One Hell Of A Ride.
","Less an adaptation of Walter Isaacson's biography of the same name & more a work of fiction, Steve Jobs is anything but a just portrait of its titular character for all this biopic attempts to do is to depict the worst aspects of the late Apple co-founder by stuffing the plot with fictional, inaccurate segments that are only meant to further exaggerate his human flaws, and it is very much evident in the film's timeline for the plot is set around the young, immature & reckless years of Jobs' life and completely ignores the era in which he scripted the greatest second innings ever played.<br/><br/>As a rendition of Jobs' real life, Steve Jobs is an absolute disaster. As a fictional story however, it's downright thrilling, tremendously entertaining & thoroughly riveting piece of storytelling that's viciously written by Aaron Sorkin, brilliantly directed by Danny Boyle, and strongly performed by its cast, especially Michael Fassbender & Kate Winslet. In actuality, it isn't even an adaptation of its source material as Sorkin only uses snippets from the book in his fabricated story that's filled with fictitious characters who are assigned real names, and employs made up moments to enhance its drama.<br/><br/>The story of Steve Jobs is narrated in three segments, each set backstage & few minutes prior to the launch of an important product. The first act is set in 1984 and covers the behind-the-scene scenario before the unveiling of the Macintosh. The second act unfolds in 1988 and finds Jobs preparing for the NeXT Computer launch. And the third & final act takes place just before the premier of the iMac in 1998. The transitions are accompanied with montages which skim through the events that transpired between the two timelines. But what actually drives this feature is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, his friend Steve Wozniak & his confidant Joanna Hoffman.<br/><br/>Directed by Danny Boyle, Steve Jobs is crafted with rigour, passion & enthusiasm and his energetic direction only adds extravagant flavours to its dialogue-driven plot, thus giving it a pageantry look n feel. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay brims with rapid-fire dialogues, memorable lines & engrossing conversations that keep the story on the verge of explosion at all times. Also, not only does Boyle attempt to do justice to Sorkin's magnificent script but actually celebrates it with all he's got. The narrative structure is undeniably impressive although the key product launch events Sorkin settles for is arguable. Another drawback is his one-sided approach in depicting Jobs as he only emphasises on Jobs' infamous attributes.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are expertly executed with set pieces managing to recreate the ambiance of the locations where these iconic products were launched, albeit with a few unnecessary modifications. Each act is shot in a different film format (16 mm, 35 mm & digital), and the quality of its images only improve as the plot progresses. Cinematography also gives a distinct look to each act with its apt use of colour palette while the fluid but controlled movements of the camera make the drama more immersive. Editing is tight & immaculately carried out and its 122 minutes of runtime is marvellously paced. Finally, the soundtrack by Daniel Pemberton also follows the three-act structure, with different set of instruments for each segment.<br/><br/>However, there's one more thing. Steve Jobs features an outstanding ensemble in Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen & Jeff Daniels, with more support coming from Katherine Waterston, Michael Stuhlbarg & three other girls who play the role of Jobs' daughter Lisa in three different acts. Despite not an ounce of similarity in looks between the actor & the character he plays, Fassbender hits it out of the park with a really smashing performance as Steven Paul Jobs even if he's constantly challenged by Winslet who is always around to leave her own mark in the role of Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' right-hand woman. Rogen exhibits the good-natured personality of Steve Wozniak in a sensible manner, Daniels also does well as the infamous John Sculley, while all three girls chosen to play Lisa chip in with fine contributions.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Steve Jobs is nowhere close to bringing alive the life story of the greatest visionary of our time but it also succeeds as a masterwork of fiction filmmaking. While there are plenty of positives to be found in direction, acting, camera-work, editing & music, the only aspect that dominates it from beginning to end is Aaron Sorkin's screenplay, compared to which all other elements only play second fiddle. An unexpected delight of the year that, despite being unable to paint an accurate picture of its titular character, delivers a movie experience that's engaging from the first frame, gets more invigorating with every passing moment & finishes on a much rewarding note. Definitely one of the best films of 2015 that's spearheaded by Sorkin's razor-sharp script, Boyle's vibrant direction & Fassbender's compelling performance, Steve Jobs isn't what it claims to be but as a fictionalised account, it still makes up for one hell of a ride."

","Steve Jobs garnered some lukewarm praise, few people went to see it, and it probably won't win many awards. But it should. <br/><br/>Michael Fassbender proves himself to be one of the finest actors working today, and along with Michael Stuhlbarg, Kate Winslet and Seth Rogan shows us what a masterclass in acting can look like. The entire film hinges on writer Aaron Sorkin's rapid fire style and the powerful, empathetic acting to bring it to life. <br/><br/>No, Fassbender does not resemble Steve Jobs physically, nor does he speak like him. Instead, what is most important, is that he crafts a character who is self contained and entirely believable in his own right. He succeeds fantastically. <br/><br/>Danny Boyle's directing is mostly on point - I'm not a fan of his sweeping musical numbers and hyperactivity behind the camera, I almost would have liked to have seen this film pared down to the bare minimum, because ultimately the things that count are all there. I wish he would have let the writing and acting speak for itself and nix the faux-inspirational music which strikes me as jarring and not entirely in sync with the tone of the picture, but I understand that's his style and he kept it to a minimum. <br/><br/>Nitpicks aside I was pleasantly surprised across the board."

","My main criticism of this movie will be that it feels like a cliff notes version of the biography. I felt like the screenwriter read through the book and highlighted the parts that had the most dramatic interest, then organized them into story beats. Now, of course Danny Boyle made a great looking movie that is visually interesting and well edited. Of course the performances are award- worthy. But somehow I felt like this movie was delivering facts I had already learned without really getting me emotionally involved in the on screen drama. I've read a lot of books about the Beatles, but when I watched Backbeat, I was somehow able to imagine I was seeing a young Lennon and caring about where that story was going. That didn't really happen during Steve Jobs, except for the scenes with Lisa, which I think might have been a better story to focus entirely on. I do think the narrative device of setting the action during the product launches was a step towards narrowing a sprawling life and career into a specific movie going experience, but it still suffers from too much not being enough. There is a maxim in writing that says ""Through specificity comes universality."" I think the most universal scenes were the ones where he interacts with his daughter, and those were the scenes I most enjoyed."

","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender), the founder and CEO of Apple is known around the world for his passion and drive to further technology. His success in the industry was not a smooth journey, and came with a lot of personal and professional sacrifices. The man behind some of the biggest technology shifts is revealed with each of the three critical product unveils. Steve Jobs, is no ordinary biographical film. This is not the story of his life, but about the man and why he sees the world and people the way he does. The performances are flawless and nuanced, with the incredible script from Aaron Sorkin flowing the narrative without a moment wasted. Sure to get some award considerations, this is one that should not be missed.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>Before the movie even was in production there were multiple highly talented actors involved in the project at one point or another. The likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Christian Bale, Jessica Chastain, Natalie Portman, just to name a few. It is hard not to wonder how great is the script that all these actors and actresses want to be cast. After watching the film it is clear to me why there was so much intrigue.<br/><br/>In the end, we got a different cast but in no way were they a compromise. Michael Fassbender fully embodied what the public has come to know about Steve Jobs. He is smart, cold, calculating, and outright cruel sometimes. Yet what Fassbender did here was to give us the answer the question: why? There is reason behind his actions, and watching Fassbender masterfully explore those reasons was completely fascinating. You may not agree with the man, but you will come to understand him. That was the nuance I was expecting to see, and it was delivered. Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman was a great addition in the movie. She was the counter balance to Steve Jobs. Winslet was the perfect companion to Fassbender's performance, drawing out more of Jobs' thought process. This film is not just about Jobs but also his relation with his daughter Lisa. We see Lisa at three different ages, and so three different actresses, but all of them fit into the narrative, and don't feel like they are just a tool to develop Jobs' character. This may have to do with the fact these child actresses were well-directed and so their interactions with Fassbender felt genuine. Another notable addition to the cast was Jeff Daniels as John Sculley. Daniels and Fassbender share the screens together multiple times, but the rising tension in their relationship is palpable, particularly in one scene that I'll come back to in a moment (no spoilers).<br/><br/>None of the cast would matter if it weren't for the Aaron Sorkin's script and Danny Boyles' direction. The film is structured into three parts, each a couple of hours before a major product unveiling. So a lot of major interactions occur in a short amount of time with all the important people in Jobs' life. This will seem extremely coincidental, but if you can get past that it actually serves the narrative much better. We are no longer anchored to the chronological storytelling of every other biographical film ever made. Instead the story is focused, clear, and concise, keeping the pacing consistent in a purely dialogue driven film. That brings me back to the scene between Daniels and Fassbender because it was the impeccable example of how well the dialogue was written. I was biting my nails (bad habit I know) during a scene of just two people talking!<br/><br/>If I had any complain it'd be that the unique structure, while resulting in an interesting way of storytelling, does hinder the director from exploring the gaps in between. Nevertheless, the performances are so captivating and the dialogues so engaging that I was fully invested into the moment. I highly recommend this film."

","I missed the previous Steve Jobs film featuring Ashton Kutcher, but somehow I'm getting the feeling I didn't miss much. When another Jobs film was announced with a script by Aaron Sorkin, my interest was piqued. Apparently, Sorkin's going through a phase where he likes innovative assholes; first with Zuckerberg and now with Jobs. But hey, The Social Network turned out pretty great, so of course I looked forward to Steve Jobs. And despite the fact I know very little about Steve Jobs, the resulting film is very impressive, as in the experience alone leaves a lasting impression.<br/><br/>Just like Sorkin said he would early in production, the film's divided into three parts: each one taking place right before one of Jobs's iconic presentations. It's in these half hours where Jobs isn't just trying to get every single detail of his presentations right, but where he finds himself confronted by colleagues, his ex and the girl who's most likely (as in 94.1%) his daughter. His ex--and Jobs's marketing executive Joanna Hoffman--agree that he should take parental responsibility, but Steve won't have any of it, besides agreeing to make some money available to his ex. In terms of colleagues, the most important are CEO John Sculley, engineer and programmer Steve Wozniak and computer scientist Andy Hertzfeld, all crucial to Apple's success. Over the course of these three radically differing time periods, we find them interacting and profoundly influencing each other's lives.<br/><br/>Sorkin's script is the key to this film's success by far. I know very little about Apple and Steve Jobs, so the learning curve was daunting to me. This made things particularly confusing during an intense argument between Jobs and Sculley which is crosscut with another argument between the two from many years ago. Information overload! Information overload! But even so, it was riveting to see a film made of 100% talking be so exciting from beginning to end. This film goes from argument to argument and never lets up. The fact that there's deadlines just around the corner adds to the constant sense of urgency. Sorkin also adds cute little details, like using computational terms to describe human behavior as seen when Wozniak tells Jobs he can be a genius and decent at the same time; it doesn't have to be binary.<br/><br/>Director Danny Boyle's primary task was to bring Sorkin's script to life. If the director was someone like, say, George Lucas, we'd be getting shot, reverse-shots constantly to 'enhance' the drama. But Boyle's got a grasp, knows how to keep things moving. He gets a few opportunities to inject some exciting visuals into the proceedings, but ultimately his task is to enhance the conversations. The characters might be walking through halls to meet someone while also discussing things amongst themselves. When two characters are talking in a room, Boyle uses changing camera angles and has the actors move around occasionally to make things dynamic. Sometimes this is used to great effect: after Wozniak scolds Jobs for being a nasty person and walks away, the screen behind Jobs says 'Think different'.<br/><br/>And let's not forget Fassbender who brings out multiple facets of Jobs's personality. Again, I have never seen any footage of Jobs, so I couldn't comment on whether he gets all the mannerisms right., but what I do know is that the performance is stellar. The same goes for Jeff Daniels (Sculley) who seems to have become the go-to guy for bosses (see also The Martian). Michael Stuhlbarg as Hertzfeld and Seth Rogen as Wozniak also convey a sense of having known Jobs for years, but never really having shed the uncomfortableness when being around him. Last but not least, there's Kate Winslet as Joanna who seems to be the only one who really knows Jobs and is easily capable of standing up to him.<br/><br/>I can't judge the film's historical accuracy, but I do know it's absolutely thrilling. A sense of disappointment washed over me as I realized things were wrapping up. I wanted to see more, more of these characters talking, discussing technology, arguing amongst each other. It's an experience more than anything and one of those films I wanted to see a second time and I rarely get that feeling after going to the movies."

","I went and saw this movie with big expectations because I had read the biography and thought the colorful life and different areas that Steve jobs has lived and experience would make such a epic drama. I guess that expectation was the reason I was disappointing. As the description of the film says it The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac. It is those backstage dialogues that this whole film is about and it is very well made for what it is. But image what a epic film it could have been. So many aspects of the colorful and unique person that Jobs is wasn't reflected in this movie. For example the pre Apple times of being hippie and going barefoot to meetings. The retreats, meditations, and dropping acid. The aspects of his personal life and relationships. And the most interesting aspects about his journey: how the whole Apple story started in the Garage with Steve Wozniak - not included in the movie at all. Imagine what a fascinating, colorful, and dramatic movie it could have been by also reflecting on the beginning and the end. <br/><br/>On the other hand my wife actually liked the movie and was impressed by the dialogues and the character and the presence of Steve jobs, his single minded confidence and impenetrable aura about him."

","JOBS BY BOYLE, viewed at Sony Center, BERLIN, FRI 13th Nov. 2015 — (The Night of the Allah Akbar attacks on Paris!) -- by Alex Deleon<br/><br/>Steve Jobs, the movie is not a film you like or dislike — it's more of a draining dramatic experience that leaves you wondering: ""How close was this to the real Jobs and his entourage?"" ~ should I despise him or feel sorry for him  Was he really a visionary or just a compulsive self-promoting monomaniac who needed to step all over people  Is this film worth the celluloid it's printed on? Dunno — still reflecting but it feels like ""Slumdog millionaire comes to Silicon Valley"" ~ and I hated Slumdog Millionaire. There is something about Danny Boyle films that always provokes thought, but leaves a bad aftertaste in your mouth. <br/><br/>Kate Winslett was unrecognizable as Joanna Hoffman, charter member of the Mackintosh marketing team and right-hand woman to jobs through thick and thin, the only person around not afraid to speak up to him and hard as nails in the role, but highly efficient as usual — we get just a hint at one point in the proceedings that while battling him every step of the way she was secretly in love with him all along -- Oscar Supporting-Role material. Side Note: Ms. Hoffman, now 60, is the daughter of one of the most famous of all Polish film directors, Jerzy Hoffman -- (Hoffman's ""Fire and Sword"", 1999, an historical extravaganza, was the highest earning Polish film ever)<br/><br/>Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak was pathetically wimpish, claiming that he was treated all along like Ringo Starr when he was actually the John Lennon (the real brains) of the Apple team -- to which Jobs replies: ""you played your instrument, I played the orchestra -- (comparing himself in megalomaniac style to Stravinsky). Wozniak, who actually designed the original PC, was never given full credit and pushed into the shadows by Jobs who saw himself as the true visionary genius of the original Apple team. Rogen, who is basically a comedian, was last seen at the beginning of the year as an inept would be assassin in ""The Interview"", a dreadfully unfunny comedy about an assassination attempt on the life of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Eun by a team of American TV talk show producers. <br/><br/>Jeff Daniels as John Scully, former Pepsi CEO and the guy who scuttled Steve -- got him fired for ineptness from his own company at one point, and was later himself released when Apple hired Jobs back -- is the only reality bastion in the movie, the one man who refuses to take Guff from Jobs and calmly tells it like it is every time he appears -- a role that sort of rings true to everybody else's over the top posturings in this frenetic Jobs portrait.<br/><br/>Fassbender has boundless negative charisma, is very handsome, maybe too handsome, and oddly short in the legs. Yet the story seems to jive with the real life riddle of the second most successful businessman of his generation (guess who's on first!) and the most successful company currently in the computer business.<br/><br/>The longest walkathon-talkathon in film history — Fassbender is always on the move as Winslett trails after him trying to inject doses of reality into his excessive demands behind the scenes of his latest new product presentation — a kind of running motor mouth pas-de-deux revealing Jobs to be the greatest self-promoter in the business if not Exactly the genius he has been cracked up to be elsewhere. <br/><br/>A leit motif all along is his tortured relationship with his daughter, Lisa Brennan. (age nine, then age nineteen later in the film) — not quite sure if he is her biological father and disgusted with her mother whom he considers a slut -- refusing to support them financially -- until the kid demonstrates her natural computer savvy by using an Apple Paint program to make skillful pictures, whereupon we see his one soft point as his attitude to her gradually begins to change. At the very end of the film the now full grown daughter is standing in the wings as Jobs, on stage doing his usual computer rock star presentation bit, approaches her with something resembling tenderness in his eyes. The estranged mother, Chrissann Brennan, played by English actress Katherine Waterston, keeps turning up like a bad penny in brief scenes painfully trying too prevail on jobs for child support and financial assistance commensurate with his extreme wealth. These scenes tend to show what a basically disturbed person Jobs was behind his façade of super bravura and outrageous self-confidence.<br/><br/>Overall this is an agonizing psychodrama –- but, at the end of the night worth the agony of sitting it out to understand why you bought your last Apple iPad, if nothing else. An interesting introduction to the film is a B/w sequence of rarely seen archival footage before the main titles in which we see the great English futurologist Arthur C. Clark talking about how computers will soon be changing the world. The same Clark on whose futuristic ideas Kubrick's Space Odyssey was based.<br/><br/>Tight script composed by Aaron Sorkin who also gave us another portrait of another eccentric billionaire entrepreneur, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, who also squeezed his co-founder out of the business -- in the film 'The Social Network', 2011."

","Steve Jobs (2015)<br/><br/>Director: Danny Boyle<br/><br/>Cast: Michael Fassbender, Seth Rogen, Kate Winslet, and Jeff Daniels<br/><br/>Produced by: Legendary Pictures<br/><br/>Rated: R<br/><br/>Watching Ashton Kutcher's ""Jobs"", in 2013 was the most boring and untrue Steve Jobs movie I have ever seen and Danny Boyle, the director of epics such as ""28 Days Later"", and ""Slumdog Millionaire"", has taken a detour from his Genre to make this splendid but exaggerated biopic on Steve Jobs. This movie takes us through a breathtaking tour and personal view of Steve Jobs's life for the first time. This movie digs deeper into his personal life more than any other even though a bit overplayed.<br/><br/>With public anticipation running high, Apple Inc. co-founders Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) and Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak get ready to unveil the first Macintosh in 1984. Jobs must also deal with persona issues related to ex-girlfriend Christian Brennan and their young daughter Lisa. Eventually fired, Jobs launches NeXT Inc. and prepares to release a new computer model in 1988. Ten years later, Jobs is back at Apple Inc, and is about to revolutionize the industry one again with the iMac.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs, played by Michael Fasebender is simply superb. He captures the emotions, the feelings, and thinking that Steve Jobs must have had. This movie opens up with a scene of Steve backstage threatening a worker of his to fix an issue with his product, and from that moment on, Michael captures that anger and arrogance that Steve was told he had. At some points, you could tell that he was overplaying Steve and that he did that to capture the deeper and emotional part of the audience. Woz, or Wozniak played by Seth Rogen was well done for a comedian even though he did have some of his own shady moments. The hardest job for comedians taking a serious role is to never really lose character. In some movies, watching the comedians playing serious roles looks like a joke that plays out throughout the movie. Kate Winslet played her role wonderfully. She portrayed this caring, loving, and moving character that attempts to set things right in Steves's life. She was motivating, and she did justice to her character. Helping Steve Jobs in this movie is one of the sub-plots in this movie, and her character tries to move Steve out of his stubborn spot. Finally, we come to Jeff Daniels. Ah, Jeff. After seeing him play the director in the ""Martian"", I was sure he wouldn't do serious characters anymore. But no, in this movie, Jeff really picked his stuff up, and played the role of ""John Skully"", the Pepsi Chairman, (from second act, Apple CEO), very flawlessly.<br/><br/>This movie is split perfectly into three acts, and is each given enough screen time. All were given equal importance even though the screenplay was boring at some points. All three of these had neat ending to them which tied back. The 1st act was very slow, while the rest two were strong, smooth, and moving. In most of the Steve Jobs movies, they always have talks and dialogue outside of the stage, while in this one, they hardly move out of he backstage or the stage. This is mainly what slows the fluency of the movie at times. The third act was by far the best in the movie, and explored the more personal life of Steve and his family. Aaron Sorkin could have done a better job of making the first two acts more fluid with more tension. Aaron has still wrote the screenplay 1000 times better than the person who wrote for the ""Jobs"" movie in 2013, which similarly also clocks in at two hours. <br/><br/>The only other problem I have with this movie is that this is nothing that we haven't seen before. I wanted to walk in and see a movie about the iPhone, iPad, or iPod. Instead I walked in and saw the same Mac and iMac drama which was expressed and shown twice already in movies like ""Jobs"" and ""Pirates Of Silicon Valley"". Even though this Steve Jobs movie takes the Mac to a more personal level, it still doesn't have that real and genuine feel anymore. It also isn't accurate at times, but I'm sure that's to draw the emotional side of the audiences. <br/><br/>The music in this movie is very interesting in some ways, and instead of the usual whirring sounds, they neatly placed band and orchestra music in too. Daniel Pemberton has done a amazing job at making this movie much more interesting than it already is. All the backstage music is accompanied by soft and stirring music, and that's what really works in this movie. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a beautifully made Steve Jobs masterpiece, that should definitely be a watch even though the concept has been repeated multiple times. Michael Fassbender has packed the best portrayal for Steve Jobs in years. Even though sluggish at times, I'm sure that could be overlooked with the beautiful set pieces and the performances. The music is simply soul-stirring and captivating. Seth Rogen could've been better even though he was this movie simple masterpiece that is exaggerated at times. To be said shortly, this movie comes just a of few notches short of a masterpiece."

","With public anticipation running at an all-time high, Apple Inc. co- founders Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) and Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) along with Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) and Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) get ready to unveil the first Macintosh in 1984. Meanwhile Jobs must deal with personal issues involving his ex- girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston) and their young daughter Lisa. Eventually fired by then Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), Jobs launches NeXT Inc. and prepares to unveil a new computer in 1988. Ten years later, Jobs returns to Apple and is again about to revolutionize the computer industry by unveiling the iMac.<br/><br/>I'll just say right now that I did not see the Ashton Kutcher led film Jobs from two years ago which was also based on the life of Steve Jobs. I chose not to see it because I didn't think Kutcher looked like Jobs at all and I do not take him seriously in dramatic roles. I didn't read the book the book in which the film is based, Walter Isaacson's biography also called ""Steve Jobs"". I chose to watch it because I trust the people who were behind the film (I assume you know who they all are). Now Fassbender doesn't look like Jobs either but that's not the point here as the progression in his appearance matches his progression as a character since he grew into the person he was based on his past experience. At least that was the impression I got. This experience comes from the events leading up to the those three unveilings which make up the entire plot of the film. In theory this doesn't sound like much, but there is actually a lot to be had. The majority of the film consists mostly of backstage conversations and a few flashbacks but you don't mind since they were done so well. You can count on Aaron Sorkin films to have good, smart, quick dialogue usually while characters are walking down hallways. We definitely got plenty of that here. Like I said, the dialogue is good but the dialogue can only be as good as the actors who are delivering it. The actors in this one definitely don't disappoint. Fassbender who is amazing here and will definitely at least get an Oscar nomination for Best Actor competing with Johnny Depp in Black Mass. As Jobs, Fassbender manages to be cold, smart, manipulative, calculating narcissist. He goes about it with a calm demeanour and can turn into a diabolical on a turn of a dime. The few scenes involving Jobs' family issues had the potential to bring the film down did not come off as cheesy or boring thanks to the performances of Fassbender and Katherine Waterston as Jobs' girlfriend Chrisann. Kate Winslet was just as good and nomination worthy as Johanna Hoffman who can keep up with and stand up to Jobs acting as a counterbalance to his personality. Their exchanges were nothing short of amazing and they were able to show off their acting ability. They weren't the only ones privy to this. Seth Rogen in his best performance as Steve Wozniak held his own in big moments and had great chemistry with Fassbender. I just wish I could have seen more of him. Jeff Daniels as Sculley is also nomination-worthy based on one scene with Fassbender later on. The only thing I didn't like about the film was that since the film is about those three unveilings, we never got too see any of them. I also liked the end of the film as it connected everything nicely. Overall, the film doesn't seem like much in theory but the performances alone should make this worth seeing.<br/><br/>Score: 9.5/10 keithlovesmovies.com"

I like most of the cast members (with reservations about Seth Rogen) and of what I've seen, I've liked more of writer Aaron Sorkin's and director Danny Boyle's work than not. It still wasn't high on my list.<br/><br/>It is a terrific film. It is full of drama, all of which comes from the interplay between the characters. The characters themselves are all interesting and three-dimensional, with well-balanced virtues and character defects (not least Jobs himself, undoubtedly an enormously able man but, if this is to be believed, not naturally gifted in terms of interacting with those around him). It looks great and is full of the eye-catching, fluid direction which Boyle showed us in Trance. It is also very well-written: the dialogue is not dazzling, but it engages throughout. And the entire cast is first rate. Kate Winslet is coming in for plaudits but, for me, the revelation was Rogen, excelling on a non-comedic role.<br/><br/>There is nothing pyrotechnic about this film, in any sense, but it is strong in every sense, constantly engaging, and entertaining for its entire length."
"isheikher","8","0","1","20 November 2015"," Danny Boyle's 'Steve Jobs' is a tribute to genius
","Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution, a portrait of the man at its epicenter. The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac.<br/><br/>Directed by Danny Boyle, from a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin, this biopic could easily have been David Fincher at the helm starring Christian Bale or Leonardo DiCaprio, but settling on Boyle to direct and Michael Fassbender as the Jobs is no slack reshuffle. I went in with low expectations despite the quality in cast and crew, due to reports of a limited release now cancelled in the US. As a tech fan i feel it's came too soon, only two years since the poor Ashton Kutcher effort and five years since the death of Jobs. <br/><br/>However, despite those criticisms, Boyle and Sorkin have created a highly entertaining drama. Although Fassbender may not look like the Apple mastermind, the mannerisms, voice and overall performance are spot on. You believe him as the arrogant visionary behind the products who will bully his team so he can have his face on Time magazine. Yet we also see the reluctant father, finding it difficult to break down emotional barriers, and eventually making it right with his daughter before it's too late.<br/><br/>The solid supporting cast includes Jeff Daniels as CEO John Sculley, Seth Rogan as the co- founder and betrayed friend Steve Wozniak, but i was most impressed with Kate Winslet's role as Jobs' right hand marketing woman Joanna Hoffman, chatting and arguing in a soft Polish accent mixed with American English. All of them bounce and clash with Fassbender's commanding Jobs, almost like a dance of egos.<br/><br/>Most biopics take artistic license to tell a story over reality, and that nagging feeling never really leaves when watching this. However the unconventional narrative and structure presented here is what makes it stand out. The film is broken into three segments, each filmed in a different format. The Apple Macintosh launch in 1984 is filmed in 16mm, the NeXT computer reveal of 1988 is in 35mm, and the iMac event from 1998 was filmed in today's digital format. It's not obvious at first but certainly will be appreciated in repeat viewings. <br/><br/>There is of course a slight repetitiveness to the events but the two hours runtime flew by. The intense tone comes and goes, with great dialogue and humour. The camera follows in and around the backstage areas not too different to 'Birdman'. The retro, synthesised score matches up brilliantly and plays a big part for key scenes, sometimes beating softly and other times reaching a crescendo. <br/><br/>Danny Boyle's 'Steve Jobs' is a tribute to a man that was difficult to figure out, second guess. It's a window to a time in our recent history, so important to our future, shaped by someone we'll never see the likes of again within the tech industry."
"markgorman","8","0","3","18 November 2015"," Whilst Jobs is a little sugar-coated it's one of Boyle's career highlights and Fassbender and Winslett once again wow us.
","""The thing that struck me was his intensity. Whatever he was interested in he would generally carry to an irrational extreme. Jobs had honed his trick of using stares and silences to master other people. One of his numbers was to stare at the person he was talking to. He would stare into their ******* eyeballs, ask some question, and would want a response without the other person averting their eyes.""<br/><br/>So said Walter Isaacson of Steve Jobs in his breathtaking biography.<br/><br/>This, frankly scary, aspect of Steve Jobs' personality is heavily sugar-coated in Danny Boyle's excellent biopic and your requirement for absolute accuracy of detail could be the undoing of it for you, because you could drive a coach and horses through many of the structural, and representational, aspects of the film.<br/><br/>Boyle presents Jobs in an extremely positive light and this is surely not to satisfy his Estate as Isaacson's Biog has already ripped him to pieces in personality terms. Kate Winslet's role as Joanna Hoffman, his right hand woman, seems hugely overblown compared to her real influence but she is a vital plot device.<br/><br/>There are three of these. His relationship with Hoffman (Winslett in yet another Oscar nominatable performance); his relationship with the mother of his daughter (and his daughter Lisa) and the three product launch performances (legendary though they are you never actually see them - The Macintosh, The Next Computer and the iMac).<br/><br/>Central to all of this is the underpinning and highly challenged relationship with his daughter Lisa whom we see grow from a wide eyed four year old to a somewhat embittered Freshman. Jobs comes out of this reasonably well as Danny Boyle positions his ex, Chrisann Brennan, as a needy somewhat whining gold-digger. It's highly debatable as to whether this is an accurate reflection of her. But it gives Fassbender (as Jobs) the ammunition to riff off and gradually respect the needs of his daughter whom he reluctantly builds an affection for.<br/><br/>Steve Wosniak is played dead straight (and very well) by Seth Rogen and one of his stand up battles with Jobs, as he tries to get him to acknowledge the vital importance of the work of the engineers who build the business saving Apple II, is a pretty fundamental exposition of Jobs' cantankerous, unforgiving, deeply focused drive for perfection in the future; not the past. It's electrifying.<br/><br/>This movie is low on action; instead we get two hours of fast-paced, intimate dialogue in typically brilliant Aaron Sorkin style that will surely reap for him a further Oscar.<br/><br/>What's odd is that the movie picks quite a short (15 year) window in Jobs career (mostly its downside). I can't help thinking the project overall might have better suited an 8 hour TV serial broadening its scope to the full Monty in all of its ups and downs. But, no matter, Danny Boyle has shown that when he focuses on smaller detailed character pieces his output is at its best, and this, unquestionably, is a career high sitting alongside, Sunshine, The Beach and Shallow Grave in my opinion.<br/><br/>Once again how can I find words to describe the quality and range of Michael Fassbender's prodigious output? Surely this will break his Oscars duck because despite some of the film's weaknesses they are not down to him. A compelling and sympathetic performance that is entirely engaging.<br/><br/>I'll leave the last word for Daniel Pemberton's beautiful and understated soundtrack. It's reminiscent in many places of Trent Reznor and Atticus Rose's brilliant Social Network score.<br/><br/>A solid 8/10."

","Ah what a wonderful time of year for cinephiles. Just enough chill in the air to justify spending all day in a theater. Bonus, the movies themselves begin to get more intriguing. Enter an Oscar quality biopic. Steve Jobs is a culmination of atypical decisions distancing itself from more standard biographies. This makes Steve Jobs difficult to evaluate, but the trick is determining if this movie is furthered by its oddness or hampered.<br/><br/>The Sorkin dialogue is felt in every moment of Steve Jobs. The language entangles itself with every aspect of the movie and dictates all decisions. Background: Sorkin has established himself as a writer auteur through his work in television. His style is omnipresent. Characters spend more time in three way conversations than they do silent. I cannot verify this fact, but I am willing to wager that the words spoken per minute in this film almost double any movie. This exceptional cast handled their verbose rolls seemingly effortlessly, but I doubt they had any free space to act. When Michael Fassbender is inevitably nominated we can debate how much credit Sorkin deserves. Yet, when Fassbender loses, the clever will wonder that with this oppressive dialogue did he ever have a chance. The uncharacteristic narrative structure is also a result of the dialogue. The film is clearly divided into three acts, the moments before product releases in Jobs' career. The cast of supporting characters are paraded to Jobs, contribute their two cents, and disappear until the next act. I honestly enjoyed every single performance. The sections virtually keep to real time. The years between each act are addressed in conversations. This creates a fascinating structure for a biopic, where the adage better to show than to discuss is completely done away with. These characters have more to say in retrospect and their individual perspectives energize each row. The approach is brilliant, but I am unconvinced it is appropriate.<br/><br/>I do not believe that Steve Jobs is a great movie because the importance of the subject is somehow lost. I was left wondering why this man mattered as much as we gave him credit for or if somehow I was supposed to think this character was redeemed. I am disappointed that I cannot wholly love a movie so distinct, but one must always yield to the bigger picture. There is a place for Sorkin in the film world, but here he is carried by the energy of the director and cast. Maybe Sorkin would be better suited for material that is denser with higher stakes. I eagerly await his next attempt. Steve Jobs is worthy of an Oscar nomination, but lacks a unifying vitality necessary to win."
"BillSims28","8","0","3","16 November 2015"," Five-Word Review: Excellently-acted, Tightly-scripted, Realistic, Mostly Compelling
","Director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) teams up with screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network), seemingly making a film-making match made in heaven, to tell the story of Apple's infamous CEO, the late Steve Jobs. With Macbeth's Michael Fassbender in the eponymous role, and support from Kate Winslet (The Reader), Seth Rogen (50/50) and Jeff Daniels (The Martian). <br/><br/>Presented Birdman-like as three separate acts behind the scenes of Jobs's launch of three products - the original Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT Cube in 1988, and the iMac in 1998 - the film progresses as a character study of the charismatic yet alienating CEO credited with single-handedly crafting what is currently the most popular technology empire in the world. However, a human approach to the man behind the myth is employed to great effect here, with Fassbender's performance lending gravitas and humanity to the role of a flawed man. His performance was apparently so realistic that the real people involved, such as Steve Wozniak and Joanna Hoffman, felt like they were watching the man himself. Sorkin's script, though perhaps not as memorable as his Social Network masterpiece (in my opinion the greatest non-Tarantino screen-writing feat in cinematic history) is imbued with his trademark fast-paced dialogue, moving the story on efficiently, yet giving each scene wit and a certain ability to utterly retain audience attention. The scenes are almost constantly compelling, especially as Boyle expertly directs characters escalating into anger - a stand- out being the confrontation between Jobs and Daniels' character Mike Sculley. Steve Jobs is a great film, with personal stories and realistic, interesting drama thankfully replacing the fake and dull drama usually present in biopics.<br/><br/>Though the film is consistently entertaining, it's not perfect. Its trouble is hard to pin down, nor is it significant - it just boils down to not being quite as memorable as some of the involved's other efforts, such as Slumdog Millionaire, the afore-mentioned Social Network, and 127 Hours. It's a cracking story, told very well. The ending is certainly well done, though it may have been nice to see some more of Jobs's life. The performances and music are in effect perfect, and it will be a turn for the books if Steve Jobs is not recognised by the awards ceremonies in some capacity. Well-done, often very entertaining. But not quite unforgettable. 82/100."
"burlesonjesse5","8","0","1","11 November 2015"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Steve Jobs
","If not for Danny Boyle's grainy, pronounced direction, the routine for Steve Jobs (my latest review) would grow rather tiresome. For the most part, this is a real ball breaker of a movie, a character study that aches and moans. Every scene is a frigid confrontation, every dramatis personae is a painstaking resolve, and every bit of dialogue written by Aaron Sorkin, strands of hurried validity (remember the jibber jabber in 2010's The Social Network?).<br/><br/>Anyway, if you decide to take in a viewing of ""Jobs"", you'll be doing what other patrons (and actual extras for the film) will be doing, looking from the outside in. This closed-off production masked as cinematic agoraphobia, has performances in it that I would categorized as master class. You don't see the wheels turning in any trouper's head. Heck, you don't see anyone really acting at all (this is a compliment).<br/><br/>Now Steve Jobs the movie, is about the non-fictional Steve Jobs, an American businessman and co-founder of Apple Inc. He died before he reached the age of 60, fathering a daughter he claimed wasn't his, creating a computer that could talk, and achieving a net worth of millions upon millions of dollars. The vehicle doesn't delve into his later years when his health declined (due to pancreatic cancer). And it doesn't give us a highlight reel of him inventing the iPod, iPhone, or iTunes. No this is a two-hour running time of Steve's life, spliced into three days within three different years (early 80's launch of the Apple Macintosh, 1988's launch of NeXT Computer, and 1998's premier of the iMac). Here, San Francisco's adopted son is portrayed as sullen and forthright, a miserable human being. He's the smartest a-hole in the room and he freaking knows it.<br/><br/>In terms of casting, Michael Fassbender shines in the lead role, Kate Winslet is almost unrecognizable playing Steve's marketing director, Seth Rogen comes into his own as Steve's rival/erstwhile collaborator, and Jeff Daniels adds on to his dramatic chops (just like in The Martian) channeling Apple Inc.'s former CEO (John Sculley). In the realm of structure, there are some swift flashbacks towards the end (Jobs and his daughter revisit their lost moments), some longer flashbacks sprinkled throughout (everything happening before 1984), a complex screenplay that sort of recycles itself, and sequences where actors talk as if it's merely for sport. My favorite line is when Jobs quips, ""musicians play their instruments, I play the orchestra"". Slammer!<br/><br/>All in all, this is Boyle's twelfth flick to date. It pays homage to Arthur C. Clarke, gives a good-natured ribbing to Mr. Bill Gates, and has an unconcerned sense of time and place. In my opinion, it was probably released too early this year (October 9th to be exact). Here's hoping the Academy voters don't ignore ""Jobs"", actor Michael Fassbender, and actress Kate Winslet come January (their work deserves surefire award nominations). Bottom line: Steve Jobs is lean, mean Oscar bait yet it doesn't promote it, it earns it. Dialogue-driven, frustrating, exhausting, and psychologically formidable, you can already put it on my list of 2015's best films. Rating: 3 and a half stars."
"apstylianou","8","0","3","15 November 2015"," One of the best movies of the year
","I just got a chance to see Steve Jobs and I really liked it. I really thought it was fascinating and mesmerizing and at times, funny and touching. Michael Fassbender excels in his sensational portrayal of the legend Steve Jobs, he manages to make him the interesting, asshole-ish genius billionaire and although he might not resemble Jobs 100%, he still has the character in full force while on screen and is undoubtedly one of the best performances I've seen this year and of all time.<br/><br/>Same praise goes to Kate Winslet; I have high hopes for her getting another look at from the Oscars come the 88th Academy Awards. She was fantastic in her role as Joanna Hoffman; she brings life, character and humanity to so many of her roles and with that range of talent, she definitely delivered in this movie. All the side cast members were amazing too; they all had big roles in the movie and they did brilliantly with the parts that they were given: Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels and Michael Stuhlbarg.<br/><br/>Director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, Oscar winner for his memorable work in 2010's The Social Network, successfully carried the film and delved deeper into Steve Jobs life and made it interesting and fascinating. Rather ironically, this same kind of success was what I recognised in The Social Network as well.<br/><br/>So overall, Steve Jobs was a good movie, great biography, it had interesting character study and I would say that it is definitely worth your time and your money. You will not be disappointed."

","Steve Jobs is directed by Danny Boyle (The Beach, Slumdog Millionaire) and stars an incredible ensemble cast; Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen & Jeff Daniels.<br/><br/>This isn't a biopic. This is an insight of what happened backstage at three distinct product launches from the Macintosh, 1984, through to the iMac launch in 1998. This is a look at the passionate, ego-driven genius, Steve Jobs. It's a beautiful, dialogue-driven story with some of the best screenplay I've seen in film for a very long time. Aaron Sorkin is the man to thank for such a remarkable and engaging script. If you've seen The Social Network, you already know of his talent, and you'll be very happy to see that he has delivered yet again. <br/><br/>Danny Boyle's directing is captivating and fast-paced. Although this is a dialogue-driven movie, it never lets up. You will fail to draw your eyes away from the screen, even for a second to blink. I love this movie because it isn't afraid to show some of Jobs' dark side. He had to make sacrificial choices to revolutionise modern technology forever. This movie is totally incomparable to Joshua Michael Stern's 'Jobs (2013)'. This isn't telling his story from point A to point B, this is telling the story of a man fighting his inner struggles at some of the most iconic product launches ever. It's genius.<br/><br/>Music by Daniel Pemberton worked really well with the screenplay and the film's evolution. As you may know, this film was shot in 3 ways to illustrate the advancement in technology during these launches. The first act was shot in 16mm, act 2 in 35mm, and act 3 in digital. The music plays along with this as the story moves forward. Starting with simple pulsing sounds, moving on to simple melody involvement and finally by the third act, a full string arrangement with a completed structure. It's also worth mentioning that this is a score you'll want to purchase after seeing the film, it's beautiful. <br/><br/>The acting by Fassbender is astounding. He's had his fair share of moments in his career but this is one of his best pieces of work. Seth Rogen was brilliant as Apple co-founder and friend, Steve Wozniak. I was very surprised to see him really getting into his role and selling the character. I didn't look at him as Seth Rogen, the funny guy. I looked at him at Steve Wozniak. Jeff Daniels has been on the big screen once before this year with 'The Martian' and he brings some great moments with him. Kate Winslet, of course, was wonderful also. This cast just clicked. It's half of what made this story so watchable. Well done to the casting department. <br/><br/>My verdict; Steve Jobs delivers some of the greatest moments that I've seen in film for years. It's safe to say this is definitely a highlight of Boyle's work so far. Give this movie some money and see it at cinemas. If you can't manage that, get it when it releases on formats such as Blu-Ray. It's worth it.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs, 10/10."
"bartonj2410","8","0","4","14 November 2015"," Michael Fassbender and Aaron Sorkin play quite beautifully together in Danny Boyle's orchestra
","A film about Steve Jobs may not be to everyone's taste but before you judge a book by its cover, I will let you know that there is no Ashton Kutcher in sight. A film about Steve Jobs directed by Danny Boyle, written by Aaron Sorkin and with a fantastic lead performance from Michael Fassbender however, and you have an irresistible film on your hands.<br/><br/>Set backstage across three separate and iconic product launches; the Apple Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT Computer in 1988 and the iMac launch in 1998, Steve Jobs is a compelling look at the man so hell bent on bringing the digital revolution.<br/><br/>Jobs (Michael Fassbender) certainly had his flaws and while preparing for these product launches, various stumbling blocks begin to appear, whether they be technical difficulties or personal issues with friends and family choosing to surface at the worst times.<br/><br/>His likeness to Jobs has been questioned but there is no doubt that Michael Fassbender revels in the lead role of Danny Boyle's biopic. In fact, Fassbender has never been better, perfectly capturing the essence of the man so hooked on bringing humanity into the digital age that he nearly lost his own humanity in the process.<br/><br/>You sense a change in Jobs' personality over the three product launches and Fassbender does a great job in portraying this. I'm sure we will be seeing him get a lot of nominations come awards season. <br/><br/>Fassbender is joined by a supporting cast who are sure as hell firing off all cylinders too. Kate Winslet is the stand-out as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' closest colleague, providing our protagonist with the human touch that stops him from becoming an android 24/7. Jeff Daniels, Seth Rogen and Michael Stuhlbarg all play their part in making Steve Jobs such an enjoyable watch too.<br/><br/>The standard of the film is undoubtedly raised by the impressive screenplay from Aaron Sorkin. Sorkin writes like no other screenwriter and his Steve Jobs screenplay is easily one of the best of the year. Combine his words with the performances and it really is a verbal onslaught that you do not want to miss. <br/><br/>Danny Boyle's film is given a further injection of energy thanks to some sharp editing and a subtle soundtrack to accompany the manic preparation Jobs faced before the launch of the three products.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs is a film that has unfortunately not done so well in America, with Universal pulling the film from 2000 cinemas, but it is one of the essential films you should watch this year. It's not as good as The Social Network but I reckon it faces the same problem with people not interested in seeing a film about its subject. I am glad to say though that, like The Social Network, it's a much better film than I first thought it ever could be."
"shadowyx12","8","0","4","14 November 2015"," Do not let the scope and structure mislead you; 'Steve Jobs' is simply superb.
","'Steve Jobs' is unlike any biopic made before. Instead of dramatizing the key moments of Jobs' life, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin splits the film into three sections; each section takes place an hour before a product launch. Each product launch takes place in a different year: 1984 (Mac), 1988 (NeXT), and 1998 (iMac). Before each product launch, we see Jobs (Fassbender) interact with the various people involved in his life; this includes marketing executive Joanna Hoffman (Winslet), Steve Wozniak (Rogen), then-CEO of Apple John Sculley (Daniels), and his daughter, Lisa Brennan-Jobs (3 different actresses).<br/><br/>The story structure is closer to what you would see in a stage play rather than a screenplay, but Danny Boyle does a fantastic job in making it as cinematic as possible. Every conversation and argument in this film commands your attention; it's unlikely that you're going to fall asleep while watching this film. Each exchange builds in tension rapidly, yet makes the time to let everything sink in for the audience and the characters. <br/><br/>There are a few flashbacks in the film; each one is masterfully edited to coincide with its conversation. They do not interrupt the pacing of the film; instead, they serve as short little insights that tremendously impact the story and the characters.<br/><br/>Although Michael Fassbender doesn't look like Steve Jobs, he certainly channels his personality, quick wit, and determination. In addition to doing a brilliant job of playing Steve Jobs as a great innovator (as the media presents him as), he does an equally brilliant job of playing Steve Jobs as a deeply-flawed individual, both in his personal and professional life. His chemistry with the rest of the cast is wonderful; there wasn't a single moment that I wasn't absorbed with his character. Fassbender's portrayal of one of the world's most accomplished people is by far one of the best performances that I have seen this year.<br/><br/>The rest of the ensemble cast is just as fantastic as Fassbender; Kate Winslet and Jeff Daniels rank as my personal stand-outs. Winslet is convincing both as a professional marketing executive (spouting off statistics at a rapid pace), and as a strong foil to Jobs. Her presence dominates when it comes to running the product launches, yet also possesses an emotional vulnerability when it comes to running her difficult boss. Jeff Daniels, similar to Winslet, is quite believable as a CEO of a big corporation. He acts as a sort-of father figure to Jobs, but also knows when he needs to let go. The reason he stood out to me has to do with this one scene between him and Jobs in the second section. If you watch the film, you would realize just how perfectly constructed it is. It just might be the best scene in that film.<br/><br/>The music by Daniel Pemberton also deserves a mention. The soundtrack may not be full of big booming orchestral pieces, but complements the film well and even raises it to another level. Simply put, the film would have been a lot less effective if it wasn't for its subtle, yet amazing score (much like 'The Social Network').<br/><br/>'Steve Jobs' is by no means a perfect film (because I don't think anyone can make a perfect Steve Jobs film), but it is the closest that we have gotten to making one. This review is just the tip of the iceberg; there are so many more great aspects about this film that I left out (e.g. Jobs' relationship with his daughter). The entire experience is both emotional and exhilarating - it is a shame that not more people are going to see it in theatres."

The struggles of starting-up a computer business, developing a good product, marketing it well to consumers' needs and dealing with taking care of personal family life responsibilities are all areas which this film touch on.<br/><br/>The most fascinating factor about the film was Steve Jobs himself and his driving desire to revolutionize computer technology as we know it, at any cost, no matter what, while making sacrifices all throughout when it came to parental responsibilities towards his daughter Lisa Brennan-Jobs, who he initially denied paternity.<br/><br/>There is a constant struggle during the film between Chrisann Brennan, Lisa's mother played by Katherine Waterston and Jobs regarding paternity. Her personal struggle is defined clearly, as applying for welfare to survive as a single mother while Apple was thriving in the early 1980's, worth an estimated $400 Million at the time was cited in the film.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect of the film delves in to three exciting product launch meetings, the last in 1998 with the introduction of iMac. During the film, Steve Wozniak played by Rogen pushes Jobs to credit the Apple II team leaders during these new product launch meetings due to the impact that work had in leading in to the future of Apple and its products. Jobs appeared to be selfish and wanted all the credit aimed towards him.<br/><br/>This biographical movie was interesting to say the least, with several distracting yet defining moments in Jobs' life which he took as a motivating challenge to overcome, then finally realizing at the end that his daughter was more important than his technological creations.

","Steve Jobs is one of the most unique biopics ever produced. The film paints a picture of the enigmatic Apple computers co-founder by going backstage at three product launches in his illustrious career, where Jobs interacts with countless figures within his life to show us who this man was and how he evolved over time. The most fascinating thing about this film is that it makes you look at all of your Apple devices differently. You are able to see all of the brilliance of Steve Jobs on display, as well as all of his faults. Actor Michael Fassbender is amazing as Jobs, even though the two look nothing alike. While some may quibble about this little detail being historically inaccurate or whatever, no biopic is 100% perfect, but Steve Jobs is about as close as any can get. It is a film that requires you to think while also entertaining you with the energy on display in the script from Aaron Sorkin and the direction from Danny Boyle.<br/><br/>I give Steve Jobs a 9 out of 10!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Does it take the smartest guy in the room to write about the smartest guy in the room? Probably not, but as Aaron Sorkin shows in writing about Steve Jobs, it can't hurt. It's an impressive filmmaking team that, in addition to Sorkin, includes director Danny Boyle, and a cast of Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels, Michael Stuhlbarg, Katherine Waterston, Seth Rogen, John Ortiz and Perla Haney-Jardine  that's a lot of talent, prestige, and award-winners.<br/><br/>The film is based on the terrific authorized biography written by Walter Isaacson. Rather than tackle the entirety of the book or Jobs' life, a theatrical approach is taken with three distinct acts covering 16 years centered on product roll-outs: Macintosh, 1984; NeXT, 1988; and iMac, 1998. You might notice that two of those products are considered major flops, but the focus is on the actions of Jobs, not the performance of the products. Director Boyle makes his presence felt by filming appropriately in each of the segments: 16mm for 1984, 35mm for 1988, and digital for 1998. He also brings a sweeping beauty to the visuals  whether it's Jobs storming through a hallway, or the maze of activity backstage at each roll-out.<br/><br/>While it's humorous to witness the cult-like atmosphere that develops around Apple products, it's equally comical to see the small-minded types who refuse to credit Jobs or Apple for catapulting consumer technology ahead by decades, and achieving levels of financial success never before reached. Although it's difficult to separate Jobs from Apple, Sorkin and Boyle are very clear in their focus on the man. In fact, the movie could be viewed as a kind of dysfunctional family – both genetic family and work family.<br/><br/>Rogen plays Steve Wozniak and Stuhlbarg plays Andy Hertzfeld, both part of the original Apple team with Jobs. There are some pointed exchanges between these three characters, with the most eye-raising being when Woz asks Jobs, ""What do you do?"" It's the best display of what makes Jobs different than others, and his answer is one of the most disheartening compliments ever heard. There are multiple extended sequences with Jobs and his quasi-father figure John Sculley (Jeff Daniels). These two rip through Sorkin dialogue the way Michael Jordan once sliced through defenses. Most cruel are the exchanges between Jobs and Chrisann Brennan (Ms. Waterston) – the mother of his daughter Lisa (though he refused to acknowledge being her father).<br/><br/>For those familiar with the role of Joanna Hoffman in Jobs' career, you will be duly impressed with the performance of Kate Winslet  playing the only one who could consistently stand up to the relentless pressure and lofty expectations.<br/><br/>There are soft references to iPods and iPads, and Jobs' break-up with Apple is dramatized, but it's the individual scenes of interaction with others that makes this entertaining and challenging to watch. There is nothing likable about Steve Jobs the man, but Fassbender's performance does allow glimpses of humanity beneath the God-like aura Jobs presented. Was Jobs a genius? Was he an extreme social misfit? Was he a cruel family man due to his botched adoption as a kid? Regardless of where you place him in the realm of technology development, it's difficult to argue with Woz's proclamation that one can be ""decent AND gifted"". It's not binary."

This was made possible due to outstanding performances from a cast led by Michael Fassbender as Jobs, a very subtle and straightforward direction by Danny Boyle, and a classic Aaron Sorkin screenplay that doesn't explore exactly who Jobs was, but instead shows why Jobs was the person he was.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle, taking a more frank approach in his direction by allowing the acting and the writing to shine more, does a fantastic job directing this movie. But by far the best decision he made in terms of his direction was in the way it was filmed. For the 1984 segment, Boyle filmed it in 16mm film. Then in the 1988 segment, it was filmed in 35mm film. And finally for the 1998 segment, everything was filmed in digital. This brilliantly shows how Apple's technology evolved over the fourteen years depicted in Job's life.<br/><br/>This entire screenplay is classic Sorkin; its got the walk-and-talk dialogue, the two conversations going on simultaneously, it's all here. However, what Sorkin really got right in his writing was the emotional relationship between Jobs and his daughter. I really connected with the relationship Jobs had with her, and I thought that Sorkin didn't sugarcoat their relationship whatsoever. Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels, and Michael Stuhlbarg all do fantastic work, and their relationships with Jobs were extremely well- developed as the film continued to tell its story. <br/><br/>This is the literal definition of a dialogue movie; the entire film consists of Jobs having conversations with people just before three big product reveal conferences over a fourteen year period, and we get to see how Jobs matured as a person from product launch to product launch to product launch. All of these conversations are riveting because Michael Fassbender is the embodiment of who Steve Jobs was. People who are familiar with Jobs work know that he wasn't exactly decent, sometimes tyrannical, but no one could deny his creative genius. Through Fassbender's incredible performance, we're able to better understand why Jobs was the way he was during his life. At one point in the film, Steve Wozniak, played by Seth Rogan in what may be the best performance of his career, says to Jobs, ""You're not an engineer. What do you do?"" Jobs responds to him by saying, ""Musicians play their instruments. I play the orchestra."" This illustrates that Jobs was an incredible innovator, sometimes too imaginative in his ideas for the technology that existed at the time. He couldn't always do things he wanted to do, but that's how innovators are, and that's how they should be. <br/><br/>Steve Jobs is not a biopic about Steve Jobs. Instead, Steve Jobs is a movie about why Jobs was the way he was, and it capture the person that Jobs was perfectly with the performances, the direction and the dialogue. If you love dialogue-driven movies, you can't find much better than Steve Jobs."

","Watching the STEVE JOBS biopic directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin was a nostalgic experience, bringing me back in time to 1992 when I purchased my first Apple Computer which regretfully turned out to be a ""rotten apple with so many problems that Apple's headquarters sent a technician to my home in NJ to change the ""motherboard."" This was the ""dark phase"" of the company when it was on the downswing - the percentage of Apple users were declining and IBM's P.C.'s were on the rise. Because my ""mentor"" was a rabid supporter - never wavering in his belief in Steve Jobs and Apple products, I too followed his lead despite the fact that Jobs was not with the company having been ""fired"" in 1985. The film STEVE JOBS gives us a glimpse into the man who today is considered a visionary having changed the way we communicate and navigate the world.<br/><br/>I once wrote a Letter to the NY Times extolling the power of film "" to re-vise, re-invent and re-position history and historical figures within popular culture Too often ideas, whether they be political or cultural, permeate into the general consciousness through the membrane of a director"" And this holds true for director Danny Boyle's depiction of Steve Jobs. There is a frenetic pace to the film - and Boyle uses the moments before the presentation of new products to an audience of devotees as a vehicle ""exposing"" the complexity of Steve Jobs' personal and professional history. <br/><br/>The dramatic focus of the movie STEVE JOBS hinges upon 3 major ""computer launch"" events - the original Macintosh in 1984 in competition with the Apple II - the commercial bedrock of the company; the unveiling of NeXT cube in 1988 - what it did is still a mystery; and the beautifully designed iMac in 1998 - the start of the ""iEra"". The products were an extension of the man himself - a person who controlled every aspect of his brand - obsessively committed and single-minded - never one to compromise - as witnessed by his battles with childhood friend and co-founder Steve Wozniak - Seth Rogan doing a great job as this decent, burly ""nuts and bolts"" man who actualizes Jobs' idealistic concepts. Michael Fassbender is excellent as Jobs - cool, detached and charismatic encased in armor that is rarely penetrated except by the always-by-his side assistant Joanna Hoffman (a staid and respectful Kate Winslet with a weird undertone of an accent) and his daughter Lisa, (whose paternity he once renounced,) - a pivotal character functioning as a catalyst and humanizing foil to the self-absorbed and fervid Jobs.<br/><br/>There is a claustrophobic feel to the film - an undercurrent of acute tension created by Job's contentious and truculent interactions with his colleagues and family; the need to micro- manage every one of life's moments leaving no room for respite - we the audience suffer from the lack of air. I also left the theater wondering WHAT exactly did Jobs do as co-founder of Apple Inc.outside of being a genius marketing promoter? <br/><br/>I recommend reading Walter Isaacson's authorized biography of Steve Jobs, particularly after seeing a movie which gives you a narrow, surface view of an impassioned man who deserves to be seen more fully to understand his historical importance as that rare individual whose accomplishments touched people all over the globe. Regrettably STEVE JOBS gives very little inkling of the man who anticipated much of the 21st century's technological innovations."

","An orchestral piece of music is made up of many different components. There is rhythm and melody, brass and strings, percussion and keys, adagio and allegro. With so many individual musicians playing their respective instruments it is the conductor who plays the orchestra, bringing all of the pieces seamlessly into the fold of a cohesive piece of art. This is how Steve Jobs describes his position as the head of technical development teams in director Danny Boyle's newest film, Steve Jobs. This is also how I would describe Boyle's stunning direction of the first true masterpiece of cinema to hit theaters in 2015.<br/><br/>We all know the story of Steve Jobs and his troublesome rise to becoming the front-runner of technology as CEO of the Apple Corporation. Before his death, he had a reputation of being difficult to work with and for claiming credit for work that his designers and software developers were responsible for on numerous projects, just as the conductor takes a bow on behalf of the entire orchestra. Only Jobs didn't took the credit for himself without acknowledging his instrumentalists.

"howard.schumann","9","0","2","25 October 2015"," An exhilarating high
","Loosely based on Walter Isaacson's best-selling biography with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (""The Social Network, Danny Boyle's (""Trance"") Steve Jobs is not a conventional biopic of the famous co-founder of Apple Computers but is more like an impressionist painting - short strokes of paint that capture the essence of the subject rather than its details. While the film may not always contain the ""literal"" truth, it does show, in Roland Emmerich's phrase, the ""emotional"" truth, succeeding in conveying over a period of fourteen years the ambiguity of Jobs' character. both his humanity and his cruelty. Any conclusion over whether his genius ultimately outweighs his ruthlessness, however, is left for the viewer to decide. <br/><br/>The film is structured in the form of a three part play (shot in three different formats) that covers key periods in Jobs' life. Each part shows the public unveiling of a new product and the backstage jousting with three people who were present during all of the launchings: Systems Developers Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg, ""Pawn Sacrifice"") and Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen, ""The Interview""), and CEO John Scully (Jeff Daniels. ""The Martian""), people he was always close to professionally but not emotionally. Steadfastly by his side throughout these years is his assistant Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet, ""The Insurgent""), one of the few people who has learned to deal with his eccentricities, though it never becomes easier.<br/><br/>The first part begins in 1984 in Northern California where Jobs (Michael Fassbender, ""Macbeth"") is ready to introduce the Macintosh to an eager public excited by a recent Super Bowl commercial. It is here that we first see Jobs' arrogant, controlling personality when he demands that Hertzfeld get the machine to say ""Hello"" even though there is not enough time and Andy does not have the specialized information that would allow him to open the Mac prototype. The gutsy Joanna asks Jobs, ""Do you want to try being reasonable, just to see what it feels like?"" adding, ""If you keep alienating people for no reason, there won't be anyone left for it to say hello to.""<br/><br/>In one of the film's sharpest verbal exchanges, When Hertzfeld tells Jobs that ""We're not a pit crew at Daytona,"" Jobs retorts, ""You've had three weeks, the universe was created in a third of that time,"" and Hertzfeld counters: ""Someday you're going to have to tell us how you did it."" The first part also sets the stage for Jobs' relationship with his former girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston, ""Inherent Vice"") and his young 5-year-old daughter Lisa (Makenzie Moss, ""Do You Believe?""), whose paternity he has publicly denied, a relationship that grows during the course of the film. Here, Chrisann confronts Steve about his cruelty in denying paternity of Lisa in a Time Magazine article, and reminds him that he is a millionaire while his daughter is on welfare.<br/><br/>In another reflection on his character of lack thereof, Wozniak asks Jobs to publicly point out the accomplishments of the team that produced the highly successful Apple II computer, but he refuses time and again since it is one of the products he wants to kill. The Macintosh fails to meet expectations, however, and Jobs is fired in 1985 by the Board of Directors at the urging of CEO John Scully who was later made a scapegoat for their action. Jumping to 1988, Jobs is now running a company called NeXT and is preparing to introduce another new product, a computer with an innovative black cube design designed for educational use. <br/><br/>A slight drawback is that it costs $6,500, a hefty sum that does not seem to faze Jobs in the least. Backstage at the San Francisco Opera House before the unveiling, Jobs finds himself once more in heated conversations with Hertzfeld, Wozniak, and Scully. At one point, Wozniak tells him, ""You can be decent and gifted at the same time--it isn't binary."" Chrisann and Lisa (now played by Ripley Sobo, ""Ricki and the Flash"") are also there and there are hints that a positive relationship is forming. When the final sequence rolls around, it is 1998, Jobs is back at Apple, and the Internet is now the focus of attention. <br/><br/>Sensing that, Jobs introduces the iMac, this time with a sensible price that forecasts a huge success. Lisa (now played by Perla Haney-Jardine, ""Future Weather"") is now 19 and a freshman at Harvard where she is writing for the Harvard Crimson and there is a deeply moving scene when Jobs confronts Hertzfeld who has paid Lisa's first-year tuition. Even if the film's characterization of Jobs may be more superficial than revealing, Fassbender's performance is always convincing while the ensemble cast provides exceptional support, especially Kate Winslet and Seth Rogan, though it is Fassbender's show all the way. <br/><br/>In spite of the film's non-stop walking and talking where people are constantly interrupting each other, Steve Jobs is an exhilarating high – one that is fast-paced with enough kinetic energy to mimic Jobs' dying words, ""Oh Wow!, Oh Wow!, Oh Wow!"""
"dave-mcclain","9","0","4","24 October 2015"," Like the real Steve Jobs' accomplishments, the accomplishment that is the film ""Steve Jobs"" isn't perfect, but at least in my MacBook, they both earn the label of genius.
","When you watch the movie ""Steve Jobs"" (R, 2:02), you are witnessing genius. That's a word that shouldn't be used lightly, but here it fits – on multiple levels. The subject of this biopic is basically universally considered a genius for bringing personal computing into the homes of average people and changing our lives in other ways as well. But Jobs himself is only the most obvious example of genius in this particular motion picture. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who also wrote the TV shows ""The West Wing"" and ""The Newsroom"" and films including ""A Few Good Men"", ""The Social Network"" and ""Moneyball"", once again shows his own genius for writing dialog and constructing scenes in which interactions among people become high drama. If anything, in the script for this film, he tops himself by giving the story a unique presentation. Add all that to the inspired direction of Oscar winner Danny Boyle (who won for directing 2007's Best Picture Oscar Winner ""Slumdog Millionaire""), plus brilliant acting, and you have a film with genius to spare. Genius, however, doesn't necessarily equal perfection.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs, visionary genius that he was, was far from perfect – as an individual or a businessman. He had a daughter with college girlfriend Chrisann Brennan, but denied paternity for years. Even after he accepted Lisa Brennan as his daughter, he had almost as much trouble relating to her as he did relating to others in his life. Think of a derogatory term, anatomical or otherwise, that people apply to males they don't like, and Steve Jobs has been called it. Loyal to only a very few, no one was safe from Jobs' rudeness, often unreasonable demands or contempt when they disagreed with him. And let's not forget that, at Apple, he developed the Macintosh, which flopped. He got fired from Apple, founded NeXT Computer and developed the NeXT Box computer, which also flopped. Even geniuses make mistakes, but what recommends them as geniuses, in the 20/20 hindsight of history, are the final results and long-term impact of their accomplishments. Steve Jobs scores undeniably high marks in those areas.<br/><br/>The triumphs and tragedies, successes and failures, mistakes and mayhem in Steve Jobs' life, as described above, are all part of the film ""Steve Jobs"", but are encapsulated in a unique way. The movie takes place immediately before three crucial product launches staged in large auditoriums. The settings are the unveiling of the Macintosh in 1984, the NeXT Box in 1988 and the iMac in 1998. In each case, Jobs (played by Michael Fassbender), with his long-suffering PR manager, Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), at his side, he interacts with Chrisann (Katherine Waterston) and their daughter, Lisa (played at five, ten and nineteen by Perla Haney-Jardine, Ripley Sobo, and Makenzie Moss) as well as his partner in founding Apple, Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen), Macintosh designer, Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg) and Apple CEO, John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) plus others, through the various stages of warmth, apathy and conflict between them and Jobs at these specific moments in time. The movie gives us these three main scenes, adds a few brief flashback scenes to illustrate other important moments in Jobs' professional life, and that's basically the movie. If that doesn't sound interesting, it's most likely due to my lack of genius in communicating the true genius of Sorkin, Boyle and many others associated with this film.<br/><br/>""Steve Jobs"" is a terrific cinematic experience. Although Sorkin's writing fabricates conversations for dramatic purposes, many of the people portrayed in the film have admitted that those conversations reflect events and feelings that were valid at those moments, and the script is vintage Sorkin. He has a particular genius for telling a story mainly through conversations which he manages to make dramatic, insightful and humorous – and this may be his best work ever. Boyle's direction, plus some creative and skillful editing, bring the script to life wonderfully and Boyle gets consistently remarkable work from his actors in roles large and small. The acting is of such high quality across the board, that it's very tough to single out just one or two actors for special praise amid a long list of award-worthy performances. A few moments in the film do feel like they're walking a line between believable and unrealistic, but those moments are few and far between. Like the real Steve Jobs' accomplishments, the accomplishment that is the film ""Steve Jobs"" isn't perfect, but at least in my MacBook, they both earn the label of genius. ""A"""
"LaurieMann","8","0","3","23 October 2015"," Captured the Chaos Around Computer Launches Very Well
","Steve Jobs really isn't a biopic. It was a look at how Apple/NeXT computers were introduced to the public, how Steve Jobs made those launches happen, and his relationships with several pivotal people in his life (Joanna the marketing czar; Woz his early partner & hardware guru; John his mentor/Apple CEO; Andy, longtime Apple developer; Chris an old lover & mother of his eldest daughter; and Lisa, his daughter).<br/><br/>The movie opens with the SF writer/futurist/inventor & 2001 author Arthur C. Clarke talking in the early '70s about how he envisioned the future of computers. Just about everything Clarke described happened in the computer industry by the late '90s. It was a great introduction to life pre- Internet/pre-personal computer - some people felt the technology would come (before flying cars even). And people like Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates and Paul Allen helped to turn futurists' dreams into realities that conflicted and competed for decades.<br/><br/>The movie covers 3 different computer launches - Mac (1984), NeXT (1988) & iMac (1998), the chaos around them and how to make it look like the computer was working as expected even if it wasn't. Characters weave in and out of Steve's sphere as Joanna tries desperately to keep him focused on the task at hand. A few flashbacks back to the early development days in the garage show how far Jobs came. In many ways he was more of a marketer than his marketing department was.<br/><br/>This movie is great for people interested in computers. It may not be all that revelatory about Jobs himself, though the scenes between Steve Jobs and John Sculley were particularly good. The scenes with his ex-lover and daughter were a little too soap-operish and seemed almost out-of-place even though they were important to the story. Michael Fassbinder as Jobs and Kate WInslet as Joanna were particularly good, but the entire cast was terrific.<br/><br/>I expect to see the movie Steve Jobs adapted as a play any time now, the script is so strong."
"tjgoalie13","9","0","3","23 October 2015"," Brilliant Acting, Character Development, and Pacing
","If you go into this movie expecting a film about Steve Jobs numerous achievements in the world of technology, this isn't quite that movie, this is more a movie about Steve Jobs the father. The film is anchored by terrific acting, character development, and pacing, which help make the film quite enjoyable. The story revolves not around Jobs entire life, but 3 separate events, and the minutia of the rest of his life, the structure to clarify is similar to last years Birdman, and the film is very different from 2013's Jobs.<br/><br/>The acting in Steve Jobs is superb, perhaps most impressive of all is Kate Winslet's performance, as through most of the movie she transformed into her character, as did Michael Fassbender. Michael Fassbender will surely receive an Oscar nomination for this performance, as he literally transforms before the audience's eyes. Jeff Daniels is as was expected reliable and equally as great, but may get drowned out by the other performances. The other notable performance was that of Seth Rogen, who made a turn for the dramatic, and hit a home-run, completely selling himself as Steve Wozniak.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is character driven, and in many ways the greatest strength of the film is the character development, especially that of Steve Jobs. Boyle and Fassbender perfectly capture the psychotic, frenetic, genius, bipolar attitude of Steve Jobs, while also showing a great character arch, as he evolves as a person. The film could have been a little too melodramatic, but the direction and acting save it. The acting and character development also help form the surprisingly frenetic pacing of the film. The film is paced like a day in a beehive, where every character is running in circles, never taking a moment to breath.<br/><br/>On top of all of the acting, character development, and pacing the film is also funny, at times touching, and different from the other Jobs films. The film represents an award caliber performance by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, director Danny Boyle, and most of the cast. The only complaint may be the film's computer and business lingo is occasionally, not often but occasionally, too confusing for a non computer whiz to understand. Using great character development, acting, and pacing Steve Jobs is another great entry in Danny Boyle's ever impressive filmography."
