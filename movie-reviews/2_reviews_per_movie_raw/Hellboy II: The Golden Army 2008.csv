","Surprisingly good funny action. Selma, girl, cute, was a nice touch. The action is all good, good efffects and a story that held together. It's a bit strange and creepy at times but all in good fun. Many good ideas."

","You know you're not watching a formulaic comic book film when one of the highlights is a drunken rendition of ""Can't Smile Without You"" by Hellboy and Abe Sapien. ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" is a more confident, assured outing than the first film and while it does not draw from Mignola's comics for its plot it is perhaps better off for it, lacking the usual burden of comparison and expectations. ""The Golden Army"" is more fantastical than the first film and is less sci-fi oriented but this is the sort of thing Del Toro does exceptionally well as a writer. He never lets the fantasy become the focus of the film, instead concentrating on characters and delivering action scenes that can only be described as, forgive the crass immaturity, kickass.<br/><br/>As entertaining as many comic book-to-film adaptations are it is a rare event when one can call one of these films a true artistic achievement. I am convinced without a shadow of a doubt that Guillermo Del Toro's entire career has been leading up to this film, particularly regarding his work as screenwriter here. The comedy feels less forced and is worked incredibly well into the script here, so much so that it doesn't feel remotely unnatural when the scene of comic drunken singing leads directly without a break into one of the film's most intensely dramatic sequences. Del Toro's handling of character has never been better, not even with ""The Devil's Backbone"", which is still my favorite of his films, and his sheer skill and ability when it comes to telling a fairytale-esquire fantasy is astonishing, as proved in the prologue to this film. In short this is Del Toro at the top of his game and providing artistry the likes of which we rarely if ever see in summer blockbusters. It's only fair that an astonishingly brilliant comic like ""Hellboy"" by an astonishingly brilliant artist like Mike Mignola is adapted this well and by someone as talented at what they do as he is.<br/><br/>How refreshing it is, a week after the release of ""Hancock"", which to me epitomizes everything wrong with action film-making today, that we get ""The Golden Army"" which features hands down some of the finest action scenes we have ever seen in this sort of film. Just stunningly beautiful, well-shot, well-crafted, the sort of thing that leaves one wondering how much time and effort went into it and endlessly thankful that some really talented people went to the trouble of making the film. <br/><br/>The film is generally just superb on a technical level. Why am I even saying this? Of course it is. Danny Elfman composing, Guillermo Navarro serving as cinematographer, top-notch editors, fantastic special effects wizards. It's a world-class crew that made this film. I shouldn't be surprised at its quality but ""The Golden Army"" really just floored and astonished me with how good it is. The cast is also excellent, proving once again that you don't need 'big names' to carry a movie. Just about everyone here is excellent, particularly Perlman with another excellent turn as Hellboy and the underrated Selma Blair as Liz Sherman. <br/><br/>""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" provides essentially everything a Del Toro or Mignola fan would want. I imagine it will entertain and charm many outside those circles as well with its fantastic action sequences, engaging characters, and wonderful sense of humor. I would personally go as far as calling ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" one of the top five or so comic book movies ever made."

","Its Christmas and we find Hellboy with his dad as they wait for Father Christmas and then Hellboy is captivated by a story about a long lost empire, a hidden army and a exiled prince.<br/><br/>Years later Hellboy is fighting the creatures of darkness and finally the story from his childhood is about to become a reality.<br/><br/>This film was surprisingly better then the first and was more funnier and much more action packed; I watched it yesterday and as its December the Christmas spirit lurks in my heart and this film for some reasons feels perfect at this time of the year. I loved the scenes with Abe and the princess....And I was glad Abe was given more screen time...Krauss was a brilliant bonus, he made you laugh out loud at his miss-pronunciation. However I think the strength lies in the dark world that Torro brings to life, it beautiful and like something out of your wildest dreams... you can see the magic that lies within this mysterious world.<br/><br/>Prince Nauda is an amazing villain he balances the innocence and evil with brilliance and his fighting skills are just outstanding. Hellboy is funnier in this film.......Lastly the fighting choreography is amazing, simply put."
"FosterBreadford","Null","141","199","11 July 2008"," Can't Smile Without You
","okay, I'll start out simple. This movie is not Gone With the Wind. It isn't Ben Hur, not even Pan's Labyrinth. it is no fantastic achievement in film that will go down in the history books. But really, it's Hellboy - does it really need to be a classic? Honestly, I loved this movie. It was pure fun. I found the first Hellboy movie to be a fun movie. . .but it lacked that certain something that was keeping it from being a great movie. This one introduces all new mythology into the series, which allows director Guillermo Del Toro to invent all sorts of new creatures that all look amazing. The visual aspect of this film is classic, nothing short of amazing. The movie has some flaws, a few strange possible plot holes, but by the end of the day, the humor rules the day, and the humor hit spot on, to make a very funny film. I can't get the song ""I can't Smile Without You"" now after seeing this film. That segment was hilarious. Hellboy succeeds in being a film with a decent story, good visual work, and great characters with great humor, all to make just an overall FUN movie where Indiana Jones couldn't. (I only mean Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) For someone who believes any film that doesn't win 11 Oscars isn't worth watching, I'll be honest, you'll hate Hellboy 2. For someone who goes in expecting only to be entertained, just to have a fun time, I 100% recommend this film to that kind of person. Go see it, it's very worth it."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","9","129","187","11 July 2008"," Del Toro cements his place as a contemporary visionary. Brilliant, stylish, hilarious, and great.
","I have long felt that the first Hellboy installment is one of the most underrated films of the 2000's. The first thing you notice about both the first film and this more than worthy successor is the passion. Everything is simply beautiful (not in the typical beautiful sense, but in that you appreciate the art that it is), and it should come as no surprise as the film's director, Guillermo Del Toro, is a long time fan of the comic stories on which the movie is based. Del Toro turned down multiple high profile projects, including multiple Harry Potter films, so he could work on the Hellboy series, which we all know will not gross as much money. Del Toro's passion for excellence is evident in this wonderful sequel, which is better than the first, and cements Del Toro's place as one of the top filmmakers of today.<br/><br/>The first thing I liked about the movie: the easy transition from the first to the second movie. Though I don't remember exact plot details, it was very easy for me to get back into the story, world, and especially our three main characters. I'd reckon that you could watch this movie without having seen the first and still have a great time (though, it helps). A great cast with great chemistry more than sets the tone and makes this one very watchable.<br/><br/>First, you've got Ron Perlman. For those of you who don't know this terribly underrated actor, he's one you can't afford to miss as Hellboy. Even though he's covered in make-up and prosthetics, Perlman does a great job of making us love him as a hero, and a man. This is something most of the superhero performers do not (or perhaps cannot) do. The just-as-passionate-as-Del-Toro Doug Jones leaves a HUGE mark on the viewer here, not just for his performance as Abe Sapien, but for his remarkable range as a couple of other characters in the movie. Luke Goss is the film's villain, and I really saw the dedication in his performance as well, something required for his character, who is of course a dedicated man. He's not necessarily the typical 'evil' character, but a somewhat misguided one, and I think Goss got that across to me very well. A fact often ignored by critics in the comic book/superhero realm of films is the supporting heroine. Most times, without the audience knowing it, this character makes or breaks the movie. Selma Blair, boy does she make it. Not only does she look absolutely stunning as Liz Sherman, she takes the final act into her hands and does wonders with it. Definitely the best performance I've ever seen from Ms. Blair. Add in a hilarious and great performance from Seth MacFarlane (yes, the voice of multiple Family Guy characters) as Johann Kraus's voice, and Anna Walton as Princess Nuala, and you've got the best ensemble of the year thusfar. Yes, this cast is better than Iron Man.<br/><br/>As for the action, it's stunning. Hellboy has a LOT more to work with than the traditional superhero film, and Del Toro more than takes advantage of it. With action ranging from lighting fast and well shot sword fighting and hand to hand combat to Hellboy versus a giant plant, it's a sight to behold as we watch a legendary director in the making perfect his craft. There were multiple times where I found myself saying ""holy crap"", or ""wow"". Del Toro also keeps some humor in there to balance the much darker tone of the film. This includes one of the most hilarious scenes I've ever seen about being lovesick.<br/><br/>I sadly feel that many will not see this movie and it will become a diamond in the rough, much like its predecessor. Hopefully that doesn't happen, and it becomes the blockbuster it deserves to be. Though the ending is a tad predictable (not too much, but it is the one thing that keeps it from a 10), I found Hellboy to be one of the most pleasing adventures at the movies I've had this year. It's a shame that it comes out between Will Smith and Batman, because this film deserves its own day in the spotlight. You know what they say...Every demon has his day...<br/><br/>P.S. I can't wait to see a third one."
"brechtbug","10","223","337","30 June 2008"," Hellboy II - Back And Better Than Ever!
","I just got back from a preview screening of ""Hellboy II And The Golden Army"" and of all the films I've seen so far this summer Hellboy is the ONLY one to exceed my expectations. I love the second films of a super hero franchise (Superman II, Spiderman II, The Incredible Hulk) because the heroes have been introduced and the origins are out of the way so the story can begin from the start unfettered. This film is not just about Action, Action, Action but about character development and their interaction. I liked ""Pan's Labrynth"" but felt a little bit let down when the creature's personalities were not explored enough. This film takes the time to establish who Abe Sapien is beyond being defined as a fish man. Johann Krauss is a great uptight Teutonic addition to the old team with a few tricks up his sleeve and Hellboy & Liz's professional and personal relationship get more play in this film. The detail in the troll market is amazing and the story rings true to the Mike Mignola comics without having to lift a story arc from any one specific past issue. Bravo! Guillermo del Toro! I can't wait for Hellboy III."
"DarthVoorhees","7","136","204","12 July 2008"," Visually it's outstanding, Mentally it's mediocre
","Del Torro's imagination is a beautiful thing. He has created some of the most fascinating creatures that traditional Hollywood doesn't have the guts or inclination to ever assemble. I would take Guillmero Del Torro in the director's chair any time any place, but Hellboy II shows that he is not without his flaws. Ron Perlman who is terrific as Hellboy doesn't have anything truly interesting to say or do, the world around him is magical but the plot isn't.<br/><br/>Hellboy is the most unique character to appear in your comic book shop. The mythology and the character are such the opposite of the main stream and to Hellboy II's credit so is this movie. Ron Perlman doesn't deliver catch phrases or gun down bad guys for the sake of doing so. He is an interesting character but he is overshadowed by this lackluster plot and the world around it. I felt as if we didn't see enough of Big Red or maybe we did we just didn't get to see the most of the talents. Del Torro constantly wants to remind you that he directed Pan's Labyrinth because visually the creatures look like they were leftovers from that film. I don't mind this per say but these characters just don't have much to do, they are there really to look at rather than them having significance. Visually I can't complain about them because they are amazing but they serve little purpose to the story.<br/><br/>The plot is really the weakest thing this movie has going for it. I felt it took too many liberties against the original concepts of Hellboy. Hellboy is a creature alive in our world, Del Torro tries to tell us that our world is nothing more than a division of fantasy and reality. Well we spend too much time in the fantasy that we forget the fact that this Golden Army is a threat to reality. The villain Prince Nuada is weak, we don't see any method to his madness other than the fact that the plot dictates that he be the antagonist. In the first film and to a lesser degree this one we were given details about why Hellboy has faith in humanity and would chose not to serve his purpose. It's interesting because we are given glimpses of what could have been something that could have added real teeth and tension to the story, for the first time Hellboy is tempted by evil, weakly tempted but tempted nonetheless. This mental struggle could have given our actors the chance to show their talent but instead the filler between the action scenes is just okay at best.<br/><br/>I didn't hate Hellboy II I just think it needed some beef in it's story. Del Torro has shown us he is a master storyteller but this time he didn't focus on the story it's self. I would recommend this film but I know Del Torro can and has done much better."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","46","65","30 July 2008"," Visually stunning and surpasses the first Hellboy by far
","When I saw the trailer for Hellboy II: The Golden Army, I hadn't seen the first Hellboy, so before I saw the sequel, I wanted to see the first movie, so I rented it and when I watched it, I wasn't really thrilled with it. I mean, it was a decent movie, but it wasn't something I would watch again, so I was thinking that the sequel was going to be a bust and probably not do much for the story, for what they had at least. Another thing was that the people that I talked to who had seen this movie before I saw it said that it was horrible and a waste of time, but I still did want to see this movie, so I decided to go ahead and just judge for myself. After all, I do admire Guillermo del Toro's style, his visions are eye candy and his stories can be incredible, so Hellboy II: The Golden Army? It seriously was so awesome! It was a whole lot better and stronger than the first Hellboy.<br/><br/>Hellboy is becoming quite the star in town, which isn't making the government very happy and they are becoming more and more angry with him since his growing popularity, but they're not the only one who's unhappy with his behavior, Liz is getting upset with his behavior as well. But things are more worse than Hellboy's youtube popularity, Prince Nuada wishes to raise the undefeatable golden army that can destroy the human race. Princess Nuala, his twin sister, is the only link that can stop him as well as Hellboy and his friends, but the strong link between Nuala and Nauda is scary, if he dies, she dies as well since she helps out Hellboy and becomes Abe Sapien's new love.<br/><br/>Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a great action movie and I'm really glad I gave it a chance. I'm telling you right now, the creatures in this movie are so visually stunning, the work that was put into this film was absolutely incredible and I have a whole lot more respect for Guillermo del Toro for his work, he really knows how to keep the audience's eyes on the screen. He made Hellboy into a solid comic book film. I love the character, Hellboy, I think more so in this one because he acts more human and you can't help but feel for him when the world turns on him after him saving it. Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a recommendation from me, it's a good movie and is guaranteed fun to watch.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Foolish","10","207","323","1 July 2008"," As Good as the First Hellboy!
","I took this in at the L.A. Film Festival closing night gala and really had a great time. I'm a HUGE fan of the comics and thought that the first movie was done just right.<br/><br/>I think Hellboy II: the Golden Army is as good as the first movie. It takes awhile to get used to Doug Jones' voice as Abe, but once you do, you see why it's better to have the guy in the suit doing his own dialog. And Seth McFarlane does a fine job voicing Johann (although not as I had imagined him).<br/><br/>The design work is superior to the first movie and the humor is ratcheted up a notch. The fights are better and more thrilling and the monsters are way cool. Great use of costumes and CGI working together (something Lucas should have done more of in the Star Wars prequels) to make everything feel REAL.<br/><br/>I expect many won't like it as much as the first movie because the newness will be lost. This was in fact my immediate reaction as well; but after a few days I realized I was just as excited to see it again as I was the first one.<br/><br/>The story isn't as grandiose as the first Hellboy, and the overall pace and build have a few problems. <br/><br/>*POSSIBLE SPOILER* There is also a tad too much time spent with the many love stories (one of which works better than the others - Liz and Hellboy), but they all play out well. And an AWESOME flashback that had me grinning from ear to ear.<br/><br/>PLEEEEEASE let there be at least one more Hellboy movie!!!"
"Dragoneyed363","9","40","57","16 November 2008"," Surprisingly on par with Hellboy
","This is something special; when a second film in a series is able to surpass or equal to it's predecessor. It's not just because the first Hellboy was so excellent, which it was, but they handled this second film with such care and pizazz, it's almost better, in ways, than the first.<br/><br/>It's very rare in a saga that the second films rises over the first, which is why when I say that Hellboy II: The Golden Army was almost in every way better than Hellboy, I mean it, and for me to love Hellboy like I do, that's saying a lot. Hellboy II had everything the first had, but with bigger and better qualities. The action was superb, story line was great, and acting, directing, etc. was just as perfect.<br/><br/>I was entertained through the entire film and I enjoyed every minute and in the end I was left with a big smile on my face for how great this sequel turned out to be, but here again, I still think it is on par with the first because of how the first was so perfect at setting up the story from the comics and how amazingly entertaining it was as well, with all the great performances that the second had and just when I put the two films together, I honestly can not decide which is better. All I have left to say is that if you loved Hellboy, this is no disappointment whatsoever, and you need to see it right away!"
"Imrak","10","201","327","7 July 2008"," The Second is Always Best
","What is it about super-hero films (X-Men 2, Spiderman 2, Superman II, and likely The Dark Knight) that the best of them are always the middle chapter; the second episode? I personally have no clue, but Hellboy II is not the exception.<br/><br/>It's got bigger action; more heavily stylized and expansive. It has a ton more amazing creatures. It's got an even wittier script, and a much better story. It's like the director was allowed to make everything as he saw fit; his vision is much fuller this time around.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, this movie rocks, and was actually the first film this year I was all around satisfied by."
"orangejuliusevola","5","98","160","11 July 2008"," Pan's Labyrinth feat. Hellboy
","While not the worst movie you'll spend your money to see, Hellboy 2 completely lacks the charm, grit, and vitality that made the original such a success.<br/><br/>Personally, my major gripe is with the poorly conceived script and ham-fisted direction of all but the action sequences and creature shots. Now, I know that this is not a study of deep human drama, but I DO ask any movie, no matter how ridiculous the premise, to at least attempt to establish an environment conducive to immersion. Unlike the first, this movie abandons any attempt at consistency and believable interactions between characters, a problem compounded by some bad voice-work (Doug Jones, Seth MacFarlane), strained performances (Jeffrey Tambor ... damn, he was great in the first, what happened here?), and, most importantly, a terrible, terrible script.<br/><br/>The movie starts out by shoving this glaring problem right into your face. The relationship between Liz and Hellboy is muddled and unconvincing. ""Yes, yes, I know you're wandering the mythical and never-before-witnessed Troll Market, but you know, I have something really important to tell you about our relationship that is exceptionally private but is best shared over an open radio frequency"" or ""Hey, I know, let's have a gigantic fight that results in me blowing a reinforced vault door off it's hinges with sheer pyrokinetic force, but then play it off as me just needing my space."" It's ridiculous, distracting, and cheapens what could have been a viable subplot.<br/><br/>Tied to this is the fact that Liz Sherman, although she can literally obliterate just about anything, spends much of the movie shooting with a sidearm on those rare occasions she chooses to engage in non-relationship babble and actually hurt an evil faerie monster/robot/whatever. When it suits the plot she is capable of focusing and controlling her powers to the necessary end, but for the most part she just stands around on fire, then pulls out a gun to deal with the bad guys. Part of what made her character so interesting in the first movie was the sheer destructive force she commands; in this, she is virtually neutered unless something very very important and seemingly indestructible (hint hint) needs to be somehow done away with. How convenient, and yet how disappointing.<br/><br/>The overall feeling of the movie is best summed up by the nausea-inducing tagline running on various banners and prefacing every trailer: ""BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE VISIONARY DIRECTOR OF PAN'S LABYRINTH"". The whole movie is an excuse for Del Toro to show you how wonderfully creative he is, to make you forget about the cheesy dialog, giant plot holes, and some less-than-credible performances. That's fine - it's what made Pan's Labyrinth successful and worthwhile. Unfortunately, I didn't pay to see Pan's Labyrinth 2 - I wanted to see the sequel to Hellboy.<br/><br/>More importantly, unlike Pan's Labyrinth, the movie keeps yanking you away from the visual splendor and makes you focus on other, more unsavory elements. The movie cannot stand alone as either a fantasy, a superhero/action movie, or a comedy, but rather tries to bridge all three genres. This schizophrenic, inconsistent approach ruins those things the film does well - action, one-liners, and mind- boggling special effects. One of many examples: watching Johann Krauss flow around and take control of objects and creatures is a really cool premise and leads to some great scenes; unfortunately, Seth McFarlane's voice work is far too over the top. As soon as you think to yourself ""damn, this is pretty cool"", the scene/fight ends and you get to hear a voice-over that sounds like the Germanophile orphan of a mating between Stewie from Family Guy and C3PO from Star Wars.<br/><br/>In short, every time you begin to feel immersed in this fantasy/occult setting, you're unnecessarily distracted by poor voice-work, bad writing, or yawning chasms in continuity (Spoiler: The Golden Army is indestructible, but the crown controlling it is really THAT easy to destroy??? Why not just melt the damn thing in the first 15 minutes and be done with it?). Watching the movie, I couldn't help but feel that Del Toro jumped the shark - that he was so enraptured with the size of his budget and the scope of the film that he completely forgot all the great things that made the original so enjoyable.<br/><br/>If you, like me, enjoy sci-fi, fantasy, superhero/action summer popcorn movies ... eh, it's OK. The visuals are impressive, the action is consistent, and the creatures are mostly interesting. Unfortunately, all of those elements are undermined by the complete lack of immersion, with the film being ridiculously over-the-top, plagued by horrific consistency and plot holes you could throw a tractor through. The sad thing is that I really wanted to like this movie, but even I - an apologist who can overlook the warts in just about any film of the genre - just couldn't hang in there with Hellboy 2."
"brando647","9","13","17","24 November 2008"," Much Better than the First, IMHO...
","I honestly didn't expect much when I first saw this movie. I was a fan of the first film, though it wasn't anything spectacular and I figured this would be more of the same. Wow, no. This movie was SO much better than the first, in my opinion; it was easily one of my favorite movies from 2008. I'm not saying the first was bad, I just found myself bored a lot easier at times. But this film was just flat-out more entertaining. Hellboy and the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense find themselves caught up when an elven prince declares war on the human race and attempts to awaken the invincible Golden Army to aid him.<br/><br/>Whereas the first film delved into more occult themes, the sequel is full of fantasy and mythical elements. The film is full of some of the most imaginative creature creations I've seen in years, and most of it was done with animatronics and puppetry with very little reliance on CGI. Wink, the prince's monstrous bodyguard/henchman, was a full-size costume with animatronics and CGI used to enhance it and it was amazing. I was blown away by the Troll Market scene and how much detail went into creating that never-before-seen world of fantasy creatures. When you see some of the amazing creations of Del Toro and his crew, you'll be baffled as to how they managed to do most of it practically (the Angel of Death rocks, BTW).<br/><br/>Most of the key cast have returned from the first film...Ron Perlman, Selma Blair (HOT), Doug Jones, and Jeffrey Tambor. The writing was sharper in this film and the cast are better than they were before. I especially liked how Liz Sherman (Blair) was given more to do than sulk in this installment. In addition, the BPRD receive a new agent in the form of Johann Krauss, an ectoplasmic entity in a containment suit voiced by the awesome Seth MacFarlane. For me, Krauss stole every scene he was in and I really dug his introduction to the film series. I definitely hope he's brought back in any future sequels. Also a bit different this time around was the ""villain"", Prince Nuada (Luke Goss)...rather than the usual world domination motivation, he is jaded at how his people have been treated by the humans and is determined to retake their ""rightful"" place in the world. His intentions are noble in a sense but his methods are severely flawed and he presents Hellboy with views that cause the hero to question his place as a defender of humanity.<br/><br/>Seeing as how I've never read the comics, I can't say how faithful the film stays to the Hellboy canon but, as a film-goer, I loved this movie. It was a drastic improvement on the first in my opinion and I really hope Del Toro is given the chance to continue the series in the future with the seeds he planted in this film for ongoing plot-points."
"g-bodyl","10","14","19","15 November 2008"," Better Than the Original!
","Hellboy 2 is such an exciting movie, visually and mentally. This is much better than the first Hellboy and I liked the first one a lot. Guillermo Del Toro is one of the better directors of our time. This movie is about an evil elf who wants to unlock the dormant golden army to dominate Earth and take back what he thinks is rightfully his. But, our favorite red action hero, Hellboy and the rest of his FBI gang including Abe Sapien, the German Johan Krauss, and Hellboy's girlfriend, Liz is not about to let that happen. The visuals are fantastic. This is one of the reasons Del Toro is a great director. He is creative designing these creatures in this movie. I really liked the Angel of Death. The acting is pretty good. Ron Perlman did a superb job playing the wisecracking Hellboy. The music is even better than the first film. I like Danny Elfman more than Marco Beltrami. This film may be a bit scary for younger children. I rate this film 10/10."
"adiemeyer","10","115","198","9 July 2008"," Excellent
","I had the pleasure of seeing this last night at the Alamo Draft House screening with not only Guillermo del Toro but Mike Mignola and Doug Jones attending as well. I was a fan of del Toro's work before I got into Hellboy but that was several years before the first movie. This is quite honestly one of the best marriages of both source and original material I could've hoped for. I felt the movie far surpassed the original. It was smarter, funnier, and as visually stunning as anything you can expect from either del Toro or Mignola. The sheer number and variety of fully realized monsters, with the stronger emphasis being on puppetry and make-up as opposed to an over reliance on CGI, is almost astounding in this day and age. The performances were also top notch. It was a little weird to hear Doug Jones's voice actually coming out of Abe Sapien at first but I think it added to the character and Seth McFarlane as the voice of Johann Krauss was a rather inspired gamble that paid off. All in all the best thing I can say that will probably make the strongest impact on the largest number of people is that I would gladly pay to see this movie again and I would recommend it to any of my friends, regardless of how familiar they are or aren't with Hellboy. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."

"Leofwine_draca","8","8","10","2 September 2012"," A labour of love, and it shows
","HELLBOY II threatens to be nothing more than your latest CGI-laden braindead Hollywood action movie, and yet it's not, thanks to the presence of director Guillermo del Toro. Del Toro has to possess one of the most imaginative minds in Hollywood and he brings a level of creativity to the movie that's sorely lacking in most genre fare getting released these days. Del Toro's imagination comes to the fore in the myriad creatures he creates for this movie, bringing to life monster upon monster with no end to the creativity in sight.<br/><br/>Even better, the producers have the budget to match the vivid creations coming out of the minds of this film's makers, and the special effects do not disappoint. The CGI in this movie is phenomenal, with not a single effect out of place. Having just sat through the dodgy, odd-looking chimpanzees of RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, I'm doubly impressed by the quality of the CGI in this movie (which was made with a lower budget than the ape film, it has to be said). It's an entirely visual film, one which never disappoints.<br/><br/>The plot, of course, is secondary to the effects, but that doesn't matter so much this time around. As usual, there's a bad guy (Luke Goss, returning as a del Toro villain after BLADE II) who wants to take over the world and who has all manner of mean and wild creations to help him in the process. Up against him is Hellboy and his companions. The return of welcome old faces is great (and kudos to the writers for giving the excellent Abe Sapien a bigger part this time around) and the new character of Johann Krauss is similarly a work of genius. Hellboy is his usual wisecracking self and Perlman brings plenty of laconic humour to the part.<br/><br/>The narrative pretty much leads from one wild set-piece to the next, with some more effective than others. Hellboy's encounter with the nature god is my favourite part of the film, although the run-in with the titular army at the movie's climax is also fairly exhilarating. Okay, so this isn't a great movie – the story doesn't hold up to a great deal of scrutiny, after all is told – but it looks the part and I can't dislike any movie with this level of sheer inventiveness behind it."

","In this continuation to the adventure of the demon superhero, an evil elf breaks an ancient pact between humans and creatures, as he declares war against humanity. He is on a mission to release The Golden Army, a deadly group of fighting machines that can destroy the human race. As Hell on Earth is ready to erupt, Hellboy and his crew set out to defeat the evil prince before The Golden Army can destroy humanity's existence.<br/><br/>When the first scenes rolled through the film, my jaw dropped. I was already disappointed by the film. The first scene shows Hellboy being a little boy and John Hurt as his father making a cameo role. It seemed kinda childish and not funny at all. The next scene doesn't do any good either. It shows Hurt telling a Christmas story which is all in Lego-like form. Definitely cheesy.<br/><br/>But it's obvious I was taken aback by the shift in tone from this film. This felt like ""Shrek 2,"" which is the best example I can give here. The first movie took itself very seriously, yet the sequel, although still serious, is very laid back. It took some time to get used to this but I eventually gave in and I came out having the time of my life! This film is immensely entertaining from beginning to end, I can tell you right now. For being not as serious and more laid back, the movie is more entertaining and better by a notch or two. I was kinda upset how they took out Rupert Evans (Myers) out of this movie but I understand that the movie is trying to have this movie about the creatures and not the humans, which is good, I guess.<br/><br/>The originality and variety of the creatures in here are fantastic. Guillermo del Toro's wide use of imagination is simply brilliant and can be seen as hard proof by seeing this movie. There's also one or two brilliant action sequences that absolutely blew me away in awe because of its ingenious thought. Many of the actors reprise their roles with one new added cast member, played by *gasp* Seth MacFarlane! He did, simply stated, a fantastic job as the voice of his character. Everyone else also did a great job with their 3-dimensional characters.<br/><br/>As I end this review, I'm going to say this film surprised me. Yeah, maybe the new tone of relaxation is going to be getting used to and some probably won't buy it at all but in the end, many people will enjoy it. The film is entertaining throughout, has a great use of imagination, some fantastic action sequences, great characters, and everything else you would wanted in a summer blockbuster!"
"barbertj23","3","48","85","14 July 2008"," Deeply disappointed
","This is my first comment on IMDb and I'm sad it has to be a harsh criticism of this movie. I wanted this movie to be good so much, and I can only say that from the opening sequence with young hell boy that I was shocked and the poor directing and slapstick that was used throughout the entire movie. I felt like I was watching men in black for most of the movie, the cheesy way that we are introduced to characters, the outrageous overacting and the severe lack of funny of the jokes. Did anyone laugh when hell boy is beat up by the mist guy with lockers? did you not feel uncomfortable and like you went to the wrong movie with the stupid love stories involved? For instance Abe falls the princess in .01 seconds and we are expected to just let it slide because the have a psychic connection. When Liz is pregnant and she has to tell hell boy to bring him back to life I decided I would never see this movie again. I waited that long in to get to that point, because I just wanted it to be good so much. outside of the plot holes and cliché beyond cliché twists the characters are just unlikeable in this one and the music score is an abomination, compared to the score of the first. I felt embarrassed taking my friends to see this and felt like I should apologize to them after it."

","Writer/Director Guillermo del Toro is the greatest fantasy filmmaker since Tim Burton, and possibly (when it's all said and done) BETTER! He wrote and directed Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy, Hellboy II, and will direct the highly anticipated prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit (2012). But this review is about Hellboy II: The Golden Army. I am astonished at the vision of fantastical creatures mixed in with familiar mythology such as the Tooth Fairy (they take teeth but they don't leave money!). Hellboy II will engage your awe and wonder, it will exhilarate you with great action and suspense, and it will most certainly tickle your funny bone because this is a very funny movie for those that can appreciate subtle humor. Watch Hellboy first, then Hellboy II, as this movie is building up to a tremendous third installment. I can't wait! Ron Perlman's best performance to date?"

"sam_smithreview","9","5","6","25 April 2016"," Simply put, a well deserved sequel to its fans
","Let me start of by saying that Del Toro had one message to the fans, and it was ""I will not disappoint""<br/><br/>I have long felt that the first Hellboy installment is one of the most underrated films of the 2000's. The first thing you notice about both the first film and this more than worthy successor is the passion. Everything is simply beautiful (not in the typical beautiful sense, but in that you appreciate the art that it is), and it should come as no surprise as the film's director, Guillermo Del Toro, is a long time fan of the comic stories on which the movie is based. Del Toro turned down multiple high profile projects, including multiple Harry Potter films, so he could work on the Hellboy series, which we all know will not gross as much money. Del Toro's passion for excellence is evident in this wonderful sequel, which is better than the first, and cements Del Toro's place as one of the top filmmakers of today.<br/><br/>The first thing I liked about the movie: the easy transition from the first to the second movie. Though I don't remember exact plot details, it was very easy for me to get back into the story, world, and especially our three main characters. I'd reckon that you could watch this movie without having seen the first and still have a great time (though, it helps). A great cast with great chemistry more than sets the tone and makes this one very watchable.<br/><br/>First, you've got Ron Perlman. For those of you who don't know this terribly underrated actor, he's one you can't afford to miss as Hellboy. Even though he's covered in make-up and prosthetic's, Perlman does a great job of making us love him as a hero, and a man. This is something most of the superhero performers do not (or perhaps cannot) do. The just-as-passionate-as-Del-Toro Doug Jones leaves a HUGE mark on the viewer here, not just for his performance as Abe Sapien, but for his remarkable range as a couple of other characters in the movie. Luke Goss is the film's villain, and I really saw the dedication in his performance as well, something required for his character, who is of course a dedicated man. He's not necessarily the typical 'evil' character, but a somewhat misguided one, and I think Goss got that across to me very well. A fact often ignored by critics in the comic book/superhero realm of films is the supporting heroine. Most times, without the audience knowing it, this character makes or breaks the movie. Selma Blair, boy does she make it. Not only does she look absolutely stunning as Liz Sherman, she takes the final act into her hands and does wonders with it. Definitely the best performance I've ever seen from Ms. Blair. Add in a hilarious and great performance from Seth MacFarlane (yes, the voice of multiple Family Guy characters, I know I looked it up too!! Have to give it to him) as Johann Kraus's voice, and Anna Walton as Princess Nuala, and you've got the best ensemble of the year thus far.<br/><br/>As for the action, it's stunning. Hellboy has a LOT more to work with than the traditional superhero film, and Del Toro more than takes advantage of it. With action ranging from lighting fast and well shot sword fighting and hand to hand combat to Hellboy versus a giant plant (the Last forest Elder) and what a fight it was, it's a sight to behold as we watch a legendary director in the making perfect his craft once again. There were multiple times where I found myself saying ""holy crap"", or ""wow"". Del Toro also keeps some humor in there to balance the much darker tone of the film. <br/><br/>The film has also an incredible awesome version of the song lovesick. but that's for you to find out."
"thegamergare","9","5","6","6 May 2014"," The Best Comic Book Movie of all Time
","Yes, I know, I know. People will normally have something like Avengers, Dark Knight, Iron Man or one of the Spider-Man movies as their #1. And while I do like all those movies I mentioned, none can pass this powerhouse juggernaut of a comic book movie.<br/><br/>For starters, I must confess. I am a Guillermo Del Toro fan. The only movie of his I didn't give higher than a 7 to is mimic. And even then, I still didn't mind mimic and enjoyed my time watching it. But I can honestly say that this is his best work. It's not quite as serious as Pan's Labrynth, but it's also not as silly as Pacific Rim. It is everything I could want from a comic book movie.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman plays Hellboy, a demon that was raised by the US Government to be a hero, this cross makes for a very interesting anti-hero which often leaves you clueless to just what he will do. Selma Blair plays Liz Sherman, who at first glance just seems like your average, ""I don't need anyone else's help,"" kind of character. But there's more to it than that. She is very original in the fact that the movie doesn't try to make her sexualized in the slightest. People may say this has been done before, but not like this. She doesn't strike you as a female character, she strikes you as a character. And even though I love Black Widow's character from the Marvel Universe movies, I'm constantly reminded that she is a female character. Seth MacFarlane voices Johann Krauss which is moved around by John Alexander and James Dodd. Not only is he an interesting character, but it's my favourite character that Seth MacFarlane has played. He fits so well in the universe that when you first see him, you're surprised for a second and then you think, ""well, what do you expect from this universe?"" Doug Jones plays Abe Sapien and it is an amazing role. Guillermo Del Toro uses Abe Sapien and another character, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss,) to really bring out his unique character designs. Both look stunning with the loads of make-up covered on them and yet you still believe that they're those creatures, not just actors.<br/><br/>The story is very interesting because it allows what seems like a straight forward, open-and-shut case, show that there's a lot that can be done to these stories within the visuals and experience that makes it unique. For example, there's a scene where Prince Nuada is fighting some guards and ends up killing his father. Now, that sounds straight forward and a bit clichéd, but for anyone who's seen it, if you ask them about it, they'll tell you how fast paced and colourful it appeared. How well the special effects were and just how realistic it was. Sure, you can say that about a lot of movies, but this one does it so well that anyone who hasn't seen it can listen to you and say something along the lines of, ""that's how most good movies are,"" because they haven't lived it like you have.<br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro does not waste any time, making only a few scenes about 60% way through the movie for comic relief, which is very welcoming as the movie is trying to push a lot on you at once, and the humour isn't only necessary, it's actually quite funny! Such examples as the Hellboy vs. Johann fight or the drunk singing. I also love just how interesting these character designs are. Some characters had so much make up on, I was mesmerized by the way the looked and they only got about 5 seconds of on screen time, which is a truly amazing piece of work. Most movies would only put that much effort into a main character and Guillermo Del Toro makes sure just as much effort is put into characters you could miss if you blink! The Troll Market especially, one of the best scenes in the movie. There's over 60 different looking creatures and you have to pause just to see them all, not even counting the ones that probably walked around and didn't end up walking where the camera was shooting, just there in case they did walk by the camera. It is an amazing amount of effort on Guillermo Del Toro's part and it really gets overlooked.<br/><br/>In conclusion, there are many amazing comic book movies and there are a lot that are very close to how much I like Hellboy 2. But Hellboy 2 stands above them, it is my favourite Guillermo Del Toro movie and my favourite comic book movie. If you haven't checked it out, you have to immediately. It is a must watch, and definitely work the $35 or so for the special edition Blu-Ray.<br/><br/>Score: 9.4"
"FairlyAnonymous","9","5","6","12 September 2011"," Better than the first in most ways
","Hellboy is one of those cult movies that most people will love, and other people won't get it. I am one of those people who love it. The first movie was definitely interesting because it was a bit different than most super hero movies. The first movie was a bit dark and humorous at the same time, but it had very lovable characters. well that was the first movie, let's talk about Hellboy II: the golden army.<br/><br/>The first movie had the issue of a not very intriguing main villain. The villain was definitely dangerous, but we really didn't get to know him too well, and really his motives were very simple. In Hellboy II the main villain has better motives, and his main goal is to make humans know their place since he is sad that his people are becoming extinct along with all of the magical creature people things. The villain is also cooler seeing as he has mad ninja skills and seems to be powerful without magic, and just by his own physical abilities.<br/><br/>The movie has excellent action sequences, and all of them flow pretty well, one scene in particular I felt was a little too short. The fight against the giant forest god seemed a bit too short and easy to kill. It literally died in about three shots from a large grenade launcher looking gun. Besides that all of the action is good.<br/><br/>The monsters in this movie is probably what made it so good compared to the last one. You can tell when you are watching a Del Toro movie because there is a lot of normal special effects like animatronics and such. That is what makes his movies good is because if he used CGI then the movies would become dated, but animatronics and standard effects never age. Seeing the diversity in the folklore creatures is cool, and the angel of death was AWESOME! The characters are good in this movie but I felt like the absence of Myers was a little annoying because it contradicted the first movie. Myers was there because Professor Broom said that Hellboy needed a new person to watch over him like a father or good friend. Hellboy himself is good but he seems to change sizes every once in awhile. In one seen in particular his head seemed insanely large in proportion to his body. The first movie made him seem very large, but in this movie he seems more average in size.<br/><br/>Abe has a different voice actor, but really that wasn't too bad. This movie really expands on the characters and adds a new one! Johann Krauss is an excellent character voice by Seth MacFarlane which I thought was cool in itself.<br/><br/>Overall Hellboy II: the golden army is a bigger, more action packed, and better movie than the first. It isn't as dark as the first movie, which may annoy some people, but honestly that isn't that big of an issue. I definitely recommend this movie to fans of the original."
"Vishal_s_kumar","9","5","6","16 December 2008"," Spectacular! Brilliant!! Awesome!!!
","Few directors can match, let alone best, the unique vision of Mexican-born director Guillermo del Toro. His films amaze audiences with wondrous creatures and exotic locales, tied in seamlessly to a style of film-making that is both passionate and efficient. His camera captures the essence of each and every moment with unparalleled beauty, every frame awash in spectacle. His latest outings, the critically-acclaimed Pan's Labyrinth and the crowd pleaser Hellboy both serve as reminders as to what movie magic is truly all about as vivid, enchanting worlds, larger-than-life characters, first-rate action, and spellbinding story lines dazzle audiences for two hours of cinema delight. Hellboy II: The Golden Army continues the tradition, this film louder, bigger, bolder, incredibly refined, a treat to look at, and a rather good sequel to what seems destined to become a lengthy franchise. With del Toro at the helm, the franchise is in more than capable hands; his unique vision and flair for action make this a marriage too good to stop after two films. Hellboy II: The Golden Army can be whittled down to one word: spectacle. While heavily aided by CGI, the action sequences are generally seamless, each one outdoing the last. Both Hellboy's fight with the Elemental and the film's climactic showdown are awash in dramatic overtones that heighten the intensity of the action. Hellboy is depicted as vulnerable in this film, not so much physically but certainly emotionally and spiritually, open to suggestion and forced to examine his values and beliefs. Aside from the glitz and glamour, Hellboy II is also a film about love, trust, friendship, and loyalty. The film focuses on the relationships between two sets of characters, Hellboy and Liz and Abe and Nuala. Both relationships are plagued with difficulties, Liz's frustration with Hellboy's ways and Nuala's connection with her twin brother, and by film's end, both relationships will be put to the test as the characters must choose between their loved ones and the fate of the world. Hellboy II: The Golden Army is also a beautifully crafted film; its every detail, largest to smallest, never fails to impress. The film's sets, costumes, props, and creatures are as much a spectacle as the impressive action sequences scattered about the movie. In the Troll Marketplace sequence, for example, Guillermo del Toro has created a modern day Mos Eisley on Earth, replete with an incredible array of vivid and interesting characters, both visually and, for the ones that are provided personalities, psychologically. The sequence is arguably the strongest in the film. Not only does it see the origins of the Abe-Nuala relationship, but frame after frame is filled with one of the most painstakingly elaborate, lovingly crafted, and impeccably filmed locations in recent memory. Hellboy II's climactic confrontation is, again, a visual wonderland, both the environment and the film's namesake army on display with what can only be described as unparalleled grandeur. While these and virtually all of the film's characters and sets represent a visual tour de force, del Toro's fine direction never becomes lost in focusing on them. The direction remains steadfast, placing story first, with every set, effect, or creature playing second fiddle to the drama and underlying themes of the film."
"i-c-d","3","22","39","10 August 2008"," Very Disappointing
","When i went to see the original Hellboy i did not have very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be extremely enjoyable, i was therefore looking forward to a similarly enjoyable experience when viewing this film. My expectations were most certainly not met. Aside from the visuals, which as you would expect from guillermo del toro were excellent, and Ron Pearlman's turn as hellboy, the film stank. Following the cringeworthy opening scene with young Hellboy (surely just an excuse to get John Hurt in the film) i was hoping the film would pick up with the introduction to our villain, yet the almost immediate revelation of his fatal weakness ensured that we already knew how he would ultimately be defeated. The plot was so utterly unengaging and dull that even the fantastical creatures could not reignite my interest in what was going on. On a side note, not being aware that Seth Macfarlane had voiced the character when i first viewed the film i spent half the time wondering why Krauss sounded exactly like Klaus the fish in American Dad."

","I just don't get why this is considered to be better than the first movie. While the first one was understated this movie was just a load of weak jokes and elements ripped from other movies.<br/><br/>The drunk singing was amusing but, as no development had been put into Abe and the princesses attraction, was pointless. Why did The main antagonist have so little presence? Why did they suddenly get mad at Manning who had done nothing but try and pacify them? Why did Krauss turn around and insult Manning at the end for no reason? Why was the giant terrifying monster that was so feared get dispatched by a single shot to the head? Why did nobody question the dangers of Liz carrying Hellboys baby? If Nuala was willing to die to stop her brother why didn't she try to stop him in at the elrond council thing at the start (If the characters had more time to develop they could probably explained this but they didn't)? There's so many plot holes in this film that Im convinced that there is a better movie lying on the cutting room floor,but why keep in character or plot development in when you can have Hellboy get into a slapstick fight with a possessed locker?"
"tankeredbell","1","25","47","16 November 2008"," I don't understand how people enjoyed this?
","First off, I absolutely adored the first Hellboy. It had great action, comedy and great graphics. Now it's true, everything we came to know and love from the first movie are in fact there; however, they are overdone to the point of exhaustion. This movie was a disgrace to the name of Hellboy. The comedy was overdone and hardly funny, the only good scene was when Hellboy and Abe were drunk and that was the only thing they didn't do as much with as they could have done. The villain looked great and had lots of great fighting moves, but he was weak. He was hardly bad at all. His makeup and skills were the only thing that posed any threat of a villain. While the relationship between Hellboy and Liz has grown, it does nothing but bore the viewer. It was as if everything was slow. The fights were prolonged unnecessarily.<br/><br/>The only reason this movie MAY be acceptable is because it seems to be setting up a Hellboy 3 where Hellboy becomes evil and turns on mankind. But even that wasn't shown as much as it should have been.<br/><br/>This movie was trying too hard to be like Pan's Labyrinth that the magical world was so far out there than what most people could imagine.<br/><br/>Seriously painful movie. And I usually like everything."

","It took 4 years to make Hellboy 2. I think it was worth the wait. With more monsters in this sequel, it makes you think you are in another world and not earth. I always like superhero sequels, they are better than the first one. Hellboy 2 is one of the good sequel. There is the usual humour from Hellboy, the rest of the team like Liz, Abe and the mysterious Johann are good too. This sequel seems like a fantasy movie loaded with monsters while the first movie, Hellboy 1, seems like a dark and scary movie.<br/><br/>The story: It is just like the usual superhero story, the villain goes crazy and bend on taking over the human world and the good guys go and save the world. But there are many monsters, you can't help but be fascinated by them. Some monsters look like from Pan's Labyrinth which is another masterpiece by director Guillermo del Toro. This guy likes dark fantasy a lot. Anyway, the action-packed story with the monsters will make you engross in the world they are living in.<br/><br/>Overall: It is a fun summer flick. With great characters to make the movie more enjoyable, action fans will be pleased with the action scenes and there is a wide range of realistic monsters. What more do you want for a fantasy action flick? Guillermo del Toro makes this movie enjoyable with his humour and the usual over-the-top fantasy. It will be worth to watch this in cinema."

","I've seen bad movies and Hellboy II is not one of them, but it's close. If you are of the ""there's no way in hell they can do that mentality"" and wish to stab yourself in the head with a screwdriver whenever a movie pushes that envelope too far, then stay far far away. The movie is disjointed and lacks continuity from the original. The action scenes aren't bad, but there's a major lack of development on the part of the villain, Prince Nuada and his race of people that are slowly on the verge of extinction. What caused the war between his race and man? Also the ""golden army"" that is so prominently featured in the title makes only an appearance in the last scene. Touted as indestructible, Hellboy has very little problem dispatching them. I believe some more effort could have went into the final half-hour of the movie but the same could be said about the whole movie. The biggest problem I had with the movie is, why did Abe make a big deal about his breathing apparatus in the beginning, yet throughout the rest of the movie he doesn't wear one and is perfectly fine? Also, the twist at the end of the movie was super predictable. Visually, the movie was beautiful, but pretty scenery can only account for a small overall piece of a film's quality.<br/><br/>5.0/10"

","My Take: An elaborate set of imaginative creature effects and the always interesting lead character make the show worth watching.<br/><br/>I have a confession to make: I haven't seen the original HELLBOY yet. And neither have I seen it when I saw the much-praised sequel HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY. But that's just what I really like about this sequel: It doesn't require you to have seen the original to fully enjoy this weird and entertaining excursion. Seeing the original would certainly add to the experience, but taken in its own rights, HELLBOY II does what a sequel should do: Not just live up to the expectations left by its predecessor, but also shine as a stand-alone effort.<br/><br/>And yet I have another confession: I have not seen Guillermo Del Toro's crown jewel PAN'S LABYRINTH yet. But seeing HELLBOY II, I am more than impressed by his wild imagination. HELLBOY may have been based on a comic book, but for anyone who isn't a fan of the comics, Hellboy is Del Toro's own creation. Like what Tim Burton did with BATMAN, Del Toro has modeled Hellboy (Ron Perlman) as his own creation on-screen, and he's a very interesting character. Perlman never wastes his opportunity to provide depth as well as nuance to his character. Perlman proves himself worthy, not just an ideal action hero (under tons of make-up), but as yet another actor who successfully embodies the role of a comic-book character.<br/><br/>As in PAN'S LABYRINTH, Del Toro populates the world of HELLBOY II with some truly fascinating and intriguing creatures. Roger Ebert made a truthful compliment by stating that the world of HELLBOY II reminded him of the famous Cantina scene from STAR WARS. What George Lucas has conceived within only a few minutes of screen time in his movie, Del Toro manages to do for 2 hours. The creatures are imaginative, not just in look but in personality, and they are at an abundance. Plus, they're also mostly done using make-up effects rather than CGI, which makes them all the more real. Add to Del Toro's imaginative set pieces, he is a master storyteller. From the opening scene, where ""Broom"" Bruttenholm (John Hurt) tells the legend of the ""Golden Army"" to a young Hellboy, Del Toro exhibits is true talents at telling a good story. There are moments of thrills and even laughs, and the visuals are superb. Supporting performances and some neat special effects (notice that I praised the CGI later in in this review) make for one worthy adventure ride. HELLBOY II isn't perfect, but it sure is great at what it was doing.<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."

","With the first Hellboy, there was a feeling that for all the good things in it (Ron Perlman especially) Guillermo del Toro wasn't allowed to do all he wanted. Now, with the success of Pan's Labyrinth, not to mention Universal instead of Sony, he has been granted complete freedom, and the result is Hellboy II: The Golden Army, the second best sequel of 2008 after The Dark Knight (Indiana Jones is a) a number four; b) a different genre, and therefore doesn't count).<br/><br/>Beginning in true del Toro fashion, Hellboy II starts with a flashback where Professor Broom (John Hurt, still good), the protagonist's adoptive father, fills the same function as in the first movie and introduces us to the story, only this time he does it recounting an old legend, according to which the king of an ancient non-human race made a truce with mankind so that everyone would live in peace. Just a story, Hellboy says. Wrong: the king's son, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), having witnessed the ""horrors"" of modern society, intends to declare war on all humanity and resurrect the dreaded Golden Army, mechanical soldiers who feel no hunger, no need to sleep and most of all no mercy.<br/><br/>Another job for the BPRD, then, only there are a few problems: Hellboy (Perlman), is going through a rough patch with his girlfriend, the ""fiery"" Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), and keeps getting noticed by the public during missions, which drives his boss (Jeffrey Tambor) crazy. For that reason, the ghostly Johann Krauss (voiced by Seth McFarlane, aka Peter Griffin) is assigned to make sure Red, Liz and Abe Sapien (Doug Jones, this time doing the voice too) stick to protocol. Then the new threat materializes, and before there's time for Hellboy to say ""Oh, crap!"", the world as we know it is once again facing complete annihilation.<br/><br/>The story of the Golden Army isn't to be found in any of Mike Mignola's comic books. In fact, he and del Toro came up with it specifically for the film, knowing that kind of premise would allow the director to go crazy with his imagination, be it weird creatures or new, fantastic worlds. From a merely visual point of view, Hellboy II is one of the most beautiful genre films of recent years, a clear indication of why Peter Jackson chose del Toro to direct The Hobbit. Sure, his depiction of the Troll Market is no Middle Earth, but a brief scene featuring a Hell- like dimension (and Jones playing the Angel of Death, a direct descendant of the Pale Man from Pan's Labyrinth) is a striking reminder of Mordor.<br/><br/>That's where the LOTR comparisons end, though: Nuada is no Sauron, and Hellboy sure as hell (pun not intended) is no Frodo, which is exactly why we love him. Perlman, now wearing the part like a second skin, is as oddly cool as ever, with his cigar, bad temper and no- nonsense attitude (""I'm not gonna kill him, Abe. But I will kick his ass!""). Del Toro even allows the story to get more personal, with careful focus on the bizarre love story between Red and Liz, which results in Blair getting more screen-time and giving a proper glimpse of her talent (plus, Rupert Evans is gone - good). Goss is a rather good villain, though slightly less menacing than Kroenen and blatantly overshadowed by two things: the sidekicks (the always reliable Jones and Tambor, with additional help from McFarlane) and most importantly the actual Golden Army - when it appears, it's one of the most amazing set-ups ever in a fantasy/superhero picture.<br/><br/>In short: virtually everything you could expect from a good sequel: laughs ( check out Hellboy and Abe getting drunk), emotion, action, suspense and much, much more. Let's hope del Toro does get around to making the promised trilogy closer (though it would take a while, what with The Hobbit and all): it's hard to resist the charm of good old Red."

"blisterpeanuts","5","18","35","19 July 2008"," A letdown, poorly written.
","OK, I've read some of the reviews and commentary on this movie, and I just don't get it. I did not enjoy this movie as much as the first one. Something was just missing. Hellboy 1 had more soul. #2 was just a bunch of action scenes tied together and with a thin veneer of ""personal chemistry"" thrown in to make the viewer feel drawn in emotionally. But it didn't work on me. I really, really wanted it to, and I waited breathlessly for this release. The trailers were great, but the movie did not deliver.<br/><br/>In Hellboy 1, we witness a creature from another world who is wallowing in his self-pity and conflicts borne of his differentness--he was raised as human by his human step-father, but he is too different to fit in. Forced to revert to a demon of destruction by the forces of evil, he comes to the brink of destroying the world. Then he is reminded of his humanity by John Meyers just in time to avert calamity. Thus we learn that all sentient creatures, whether human or wanna-be human, can take charge of their destiny; we can overcome our programming.<br/><br/>Then there was the romantic triangle that formed between Meyers, Liz, and Hellboy. Liz was a confused, troubled girl who sort of loved Hellboy but was so afraid of her power that she withdrew into a shell. Meyers drew her out of that shell, and in the process fell in love with her (or at least developed a bit of a crush). In the end, Liz herself realized her responsibilities and loyalties in time to save her buddy Hellboy and thus she came into her full power as a super hero and a woman.<br/><br/>Hoo boy. What a world they created. Now we come to Hellboy 2. Meyers is inexplicably gone, even though Dr. Broom specifically recruited him to continue HB's lessons in being human. Abe has changed, and oh, do I miss Michael Lindsay's voice! I have read that Lindsay wanted Doug Jones to recite his own lines, so I guess he got what he wanted, and as a result the delicate and humorous Abe we came to know in HB 1 is gone. Oh yes, and Abe was willing without hesitation to cravenly betray humanity because of his love for the Princess. Sorry, I don't buy that. This isn't the same Abe.<br/><br/>Tom Manning has also changed--he was a take-charge guy before, butting heads with Hellboy all through the first movie, but in the end he was won over and the two came to have a mutual respect. Now, suddenly he's reduced to bribing Hellboy with cigars to not show himself in public. What happened? Manning was useless and contemptible in this movie.<br/><br/>I don't see the point of Kraus except as more eye candy. Evidently they were hoping Kraus would add some humor and tension to the story, but it didn't really work. But he was an interesting creature, nonetheless.<br/><br/>The elves wore too much makeup and the princess behaved strangely. The prince, at least, had some motivation in this movie, unlike almost everyone else. But he was also either a psychopath who would unhesitatingly slaughter his father or else the elves are just different from us humans. Not very believable in either case.<br/><br/>Oh, and Hellboy became weaker in this movie. He was a powerful, kick-butt demon in the first one, and now he gets knocked on his ass by every monster that comes along. He gets a magical razor in his chest and almost dies. What happened to the Hellboy we knew from HB1?<br/><br/>Lastly, and sadly, was the ridiculous scene at the end where the agents quit. Huh? Since when had the Department become an evil big bad boss that deserved to be treated so shabbily? They took these freaks in, trained them, helped them to have a niche in a hostile world, and together they protected humanity from the ""things that go bump in the night"". This is Professor Broom's legacy. Now, as if to show how little they think of Prof. Broom, Hellboy and his gang just walked away from Manning, leaving him plaintively crying for them to come back. And where exactly were they going? To live on a commune of mutants and freaks somewhere in Ireland, where they happened to be stranded? Brilliant writing, guys, this really ties everything together--not!!!<br/><br/>I could go on and on. Well, it's only a movie. But I am really disappointed."
"bob the moo","Null","6","9","15 October 2008"," Beautiful to behold but the average plotting and characterisations balance that out to make a solid and entertaining blockbuster
","Despite his best efforts, the work of the Bureau for Paranormal Research & Defence is still secret, with Hellboy unable to be more than some blurred photos leaked onto the net and Agent Manning stressed out about the difficulty in controlling his team. Behind the scenes, internal relationships between Hellboy and Liz are strained, with Liz keeping a secret that will change their lives. They quickly have to focus on much bigger problems though as Elf prince Nuada returns from his self-imposed exile to take the throne of his father and awaken the legendary Golden Army to break the long-held truce between his people and humanity. So begins a race against time for both sides, to recover the three pieces of the golden crown needed to awaken and command the indestructible army of 4900 golden machines.<br/><br/>The Hellboy series has yet to really excite me as part 2 left me with the same overwhelming feeling of it being ""OK"" that the first film had done. In reviewing the first film I had said that if it carries on then I doubt it would get much more than one more film unless it addressed these issues and mostly I felt that the film didn't look to the core of the weakness. This is in how unengaging I found it and it comes from the plotting and the characters. Here we have a solid enough plot that offers another opportunity to force Hellboy down a ""you with them or with us?"" line as well as ""developing"" the characters by way of changing relationship dynamics. These things are all done but they are not really ""delivered"" so much as just put on the screen like you would put books on a shelf. This pure functionality in the writing is pretty much what keeps me from really getting into it and in this regard it is just like the first film, except this time it can't be covered by the ""introduction"" format and it stands out a bit more than it should So what we are left with is actually quite a ""normal"" blockbuster in regards plot and characters. We have the world in danger, we have a grumpy hero with an arsenal of guns and one-liners, a good looking woman, sidekicks, nasty villains and so on. As a result we do get a reasonably solid film but it does help that for all the lack of imagination in his script, del Toro has brought his A-game in the design and realisation of the creatures. As a work of visual creativity, the film is wonder of weird creations that are fascinating and inventive. The problem is that perhaps the rest of the film doesn't deserve this level of creativity in this aspect because the rest of it doesn't fit.<br/><br/>The cast mostly find themselves working within the parts that are not as good as the design. Perlman is always a bad-ass presence and as such is welcome in the character, but he can't do much with it other than be ""big"" and ""mean""; what few chances there are to do more are awkward because it doesn't fit with the majority of what he is doing. Blair is a better actress than this film would suggest and again she is handed a ""development"" subplot that isn't actually developed and as a result she doesn't convince - doesn't always look the most natural in busy FX scenes either. Goss and Walton are not the best villains but they are engaging enough to carry their parts. Jones is the usual good ""man in a suit"" across several characters and brings physical presence to those characters well. Tambor is left with a comedy role that is not actually that funny, while the addition of the character Krauss is a nice one.<br/><br/>Hellboy 2 is not a great film but it is still a solid and engaging one. To look at clips or still though, you would expect so much more because visually it is wonderfully designed in the creatures and sets that are throughout, but this imagination and creativity is lacking in other aspects such as characters, script and plotting. It never bored me or made me hate it but at the same time it never really excited or engaged me as a total film. Almost worth seeing just for the visual extravagance of it but disappointing for the rest of it being rather ordinary by comparison."
"LazySod","6","6","9","2 September 2008"," A mere shadow of the first
","Our red anti-hero is back. Together with the agency he's out to save the world again. And this time he's all gentle and careful about it. No, I'm kidding, he's just as rude and crude as he was the first time around.<br/><br/>Where the first film worked because of the new ""hero"" this second one has nothing like that to start it off. So instead of being able to rely on the newness of things it has to come with something extra and quite sadly the one thing new it does bring takes the film away from what it should be. For me the added creatures just did not belong in a film like this and actually made it a lot worse than it should have been.<br/><br/>It's still a fun film, for the most of it, but it could have done a lot better if it had stuck a little closer to the tale of the original one (and as far as I've heard, the comic books the first film was based on). If there is going to be a third one I for one hope they return to the original style.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 big hearted bad guys"

","Wow! Is the only phrase I can think of when trying to describe this film in a one word summary!<br/><br/>I was literally absorbed into this film right from scene one to the climactic finale and the final curtain lowered. HELLBOY 2: The Golden Army was so much more than just another ""superhero"" film. It was a visually stunning, fantasy action, adventure thrill-ride that can only be described as....well: EPIC!!!<br/><br/>Deltoro has surely out done himself in this sequel to 2004's Hellboy which was still a good film but is weak compared to this one! Everything about this film was brilliant, the story, the visuals (effects), the script and the cast were all miles better in their roles this time around than previously especially Salma Blair who has seemed to have really improved as an actress over the last four years. Ron Perlman and Doug Jones were also classic in their roles and you can just tell how comfortable they are in character. I won't give anything away but their are some hilarious scenes involving the two of them, some beer and some drunken singing!!!<br/><br/>I was really empressed with this film as it lived up to and beyond all my expectations un-like the rather disappointing ""Incredible Hulk"" which wasn't anywhere near as good as I was hoping. Don't even get me started on ""The Dark Knight"" because as far as I'm concerned ""HELLBOY 2:The Golden Army"" was waaaaaaaaaaay better. It's a real shame this film opened around the same time as the ""Dark Knight"" because it really didn't get the attention and credit it deserves! I'm really looking forward to a third installment of ""HELLBOY"" but I believe it will be very hard to out-do this film!<br/><br/>All in all, if you're a fan of HELLBOY 2004 or just great fantasy, action films in general then ""HELLBOY 2"" is definitely a must-see!!!"
"luz001","1","23","47","17 July 2008"," a discredit to the human race
","I went into this expecting to see a fun, mindless action movie... maybe a little bit campy or predictable, but still entertaining.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it was the opposite of entertaining. It was a mess of things that didn't make any sense, characters as plot devices, and terribly unfunny one-liners. Oh, the one-liners. They were so cringe-worthy. At one point, Hellboy says the phrase ""your royal ass-ness!"" to Prince Nuada as if it's some sort of witty insult, rather than something that nobody has said since fifth grade.<br/><br/>Also, Seth McFarlane as mechanical-suit-man was incredibly distracting because his voice, with the German accent, sounded exactly like Klauss... the fish from American Dad.<br/><br/>None of the plot developments made any sense in the context of the story; they were only there to serve the writers' ends and seemed terribly contrived and unrealistic. And OK, movies always have plot holes -- but in most cases, the movie manages to suspend your disbelief and you forgive its minor flaws. Not so in this case, because there were just so many problems.<br/><br/>--------------------SPOILERS:-------------------------<br/><br/>The Abe/Prince Nuala romance was stupid and sudden and utterly pointless; Abe was useless as a member of the team (why was he even there??); somehow the elves were content to live in the SEWERS after they had won the war and signed a treaty that humans should have the cities and elves the forests... I mean, really. Prince Nuada was the only one who was like, ""uhh.. something's not right here. oh right, we're living in a f*cking SEWER!"" And it goes on: Abe gives up the crown piece to Prince Nuada even though his hostage (the princess) isn't in ANY danger whatsoever; for some reason, Princess Nuala sacrifices herself AND her brother to save the life of Hellboy, who she wouldn't even care about if it weren't for the fact that he's the main protagonist and the audience is supposed to be rooting for him; Selma Blair's character tells Hellboy that she's pregnant to give him a reason to live (this whole scene was about as subtle as a brick. and honestly -- loving your girlfriend isn't reason enough to live?); and then everyone inexplicably QUITS the team for no reason (except, I guess to seem like Badass Rebels That Don't Bow to Authority).<br/><br/>-------------------END SPOILERS-------------------- <br/><br/>None of this came off as believable to me; I was constantly pulled out of the movie because it only made sense in the context of del toro trying to move the plot along when the events constituting it just wouldn't fit.<br/><br/>The only redeeming part of the whole thing was Prince Nuada, who was sinister and gravity-defying and interesting to watch. I found myself rooting for him to stab the sh*t out of Hellboy."
"EVONick","2","20","40","16 July 2008"," Mind-numbingly derivative and predictable
","This movie is a prime example of why I don't often see movies in the theater anymore. If I were at home I could have just turned it off, but if I've spent both time and money getting to the theater, I feel compelled to at least sit thru the movie in hopes that it'll get better. This one didn't.<br/><br/>The problem with sequels is that you've already introduced the characters in the original, so now you have to make them do something the audience cares about. Which generally means a good story. The plot here is OK, but its ""Broken truce from the past/battle fought here on Earth tonight/fate of mankind"" has been done ad nauseum, and better than this. Del Toro has done much better work than this, and I feel he's either out of his element in a big budget Hollywood movie, or that he has much less creative control in such situations.<br/><br/>This movie is a mishmash of hackneyed plot (she's pregnant), inane dialog ""You must stay fock-you-sed"" (see how funny words can sound when Germans pronounce them?), crummy sets (the Troll Market has nothing on Diagon Alley), and Abe Sapien doing his best ""C3PO in a fish suit"" impression.<br/><br/>The Forest Elemental is a particularly offensive segment. At its start, Prince Nuada opens the ""Golden EggCage of Power"" and pulls out the Pulsing Green Jelly Belly. Princess Nuala, who presumably knows what this thing is, does nothing to stop it, does not even yell ""Get It!"", she just comments that ""It's heading for water"" as the characters inexplicably watch it bounce along and let it roll into water after a fairly lackluster attempt (after it's too late) by Abe to stop it. Perhaps the Jelly Belly has a standing 8 second Stupefy Curse upon release...<br/><br/>No, the real reason the characters do nothing to stop the Jelly Belly is because if they did then the movie makers wouldn't get to show us just how much money they spent on CGI. <br/><br/>On a side note, this bothered me throughout the movie. The possessed Tooth Fairy and the ""Sleeping Giant Rock ManDoor"" were just ""Hey Look at Me, I'm CGI!"" scenes that could have been much shorter because they added nothing to the progression of the story. Do I really care about a killer Tooth Fairy in its death throes?<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the Elemental. This is probably the biggest budget scene, but also the most emotionally muddled. After dispatching this humongous tentacled creature which predictably destroys cars, buildings, people etc.., the Prince leaves Hellboy a dilemma: can you kill the last creature of its kind? Well, since that creature tends to wantonly destroy everything, it's not too hard a dilemma. After Hellboy (too) easily kills the creature, and it starts dying, we are made to feel sorry for it. Wait up, 45 seconds ago it was killing people left and right, and now I'm supposed to feel sorry for it as it dies? I mean, it's only CGI. It bored me while it was destroying and now it's boring me while it's dying! Move on to the next scene already!<br/><br/>The ending was almost as bad. After descending into the Lair of the Hidden Golden Army, which looked suspiciously like the derelict spacecraft in Alien, Hellboy has it out with Prince Nadua in ""every 'Gladiator meets Martial Arts' fight you've ever seen"" manner. It would've been better if HB had managed to dispatch the Prince in a shorter and more clever way, because then we wouldn't've had to've sit through that mind-numbing segment, but I suspect the movie makers had enough trouble stretching the plot to get the movie past an hour.<br/><br/>At the very end, the 4 main characters inexplicably quit their jobs, and I suspect one whole scene and perhaps a subplot was cut, because this mass exodus comes out of nowhere. To further highlight their resignation, the German Krauss character says to Jeffrey Tambor after his pleas for their return, ""Suck my ectoplasmic schwanzstucker"", which about sums up the literacy level of the script. Over 15 need not apply!<br/><br/>The only positive thing about this cryptic ending is that now that all the main characters have quit their jobs, there may be no Hellboy 3."

The story itself is interesting, but the spoken lines are cheesy at best. Watching the movie, I felt like it was very hastily put together, almost as if the producers of the first movie said to themselves ""hey we should make another one of these because it did so well"" and yet never really thought out how to do it. Sure, the action scenes are cool and the visuals are stunning. But that's where the greatness ends. I had thought beforehand that I would be annoyed listening to Doug Jones instead of David Hyde Pierce as the voice of Abe. That was the least of this film's problems.

It really left us feeling empty when we left the cinema and I definitely would not want to see Hellboy 3 anymore should that ever come out.<br/><br/>Also - a lot of the del Toro designs in the movie look like they've just been lifted from his other movies and feel very lazy - I would have liked to have seen much more original concepts in his work and am a bit disappointed with that too.<br/><br/>Overall - a very disappointed Hellboy fan."

","I remember seeing the first one 4 years ago and being entertained by it, so at a preview screening at my local cinema I chose to see the sequel, but I left feeling quite disappointed.<br/><br/>Acting: There were no real standouts for me as most of the actors were adequate with what they were given. I didn't however think the woman playing the princess was that convincing in places. However, Pearlman, Blair, Jones and the villain Goss all play their roles sufficiently.<br/><br/>Pacing: Scenes obviously ended to be followed with expected laughs from the audience but just weren't always funny and the romantic subplots did seem to me to get quite annoying and generic and maybe wasted valuable screen time. The ending with the Golden Army from the title wasn't realised to the extent it could've been and felt too easily over and done with.<br/><br/>Cinematography/SFX: Here's where I give credit to where it's rightly due  the set pieces, especially the throne room with Prince Nuada and his father, the King are beautiful and the CGI looks very solid (maybe it's more animatronics?). I thought the Golden Army's design could've been to made to look more different and original(and menacing), but Del Toro has a good eye for detail for fantastical creatures. The makeup on Goss and the actress playing the princess was also very well done.<br/><br/>Music: The score did get quite OTT some of the time, especially when something romantic or tragic happened. The use of Can't Smile Without You was a bit cheesy to be honest, and could've been replaced with a simple but effective score.<br/><br/>Overall: Not as funny as it thinks it's is, with a lot of one-liners not eliciting laughs from my audience nor getting a real emotional connection when main characters' lives were in danger, it just felt like it could've been so much more. The climax too felt generic and resolved too conveniently and predictably and as aforementioned, the full power of the Golden Army felt on our world would've been cool to see, and it ended like a soap in my opinion. Although it probably has more action than the first, I don't think it's a better sequel. Visuals in my view, don't make a film a masterpiece if it doesn't have enough inventiveness or even takes the time to delve deeper into a characters' conscience and morals. Shame really."

"Radkiel","9","2","2","12 March 2018"," A refreshing vision of super-heroes and fantasy
","Hellboy 2 : The Golden Army is a movie by Guillermo Del Toro. It's a sequel of the first « Hellboy ». Even if it is a comic book adaptation (Hellboy is a character created by Mike Mignola ) the movie follow its own path .<br/><br/> I was searching for a creative movie that takes the super-hero concept and treats it with another point of view . And with Hellboy I wasn't disappointed at all. The movie takes its time to create a universe where everything seems consistent .All characters have some developement and their relations are natural. The casts performance is pretty good and serves the plot. Ron Perlman made everything to make hellboy alive in our eyes. Selma Blair lends her features to Liz Sherman, and gives to « Hellboy » a realistic love story with ups and downs. Lost, searching for help and trying her best to find a place, The evolution of the character can be seen in the performance of Mrs Blair. Luke Goss and Anna Walton Made a surprisingly good duo and the opposition between the two characters works well. But the most impressive performance comes from Doug Jones, playing not one but three characters : Abe Sapien the only real friend and side-kick of Hellboy, The chamberlain and the Angel of death. Doug Jones is really good in making us feel emotions with his movements more than his face, and that's why he is perfect to play thoses characters born from Del Toro's mind.<br/><br/> An important thing about this movie production is that Del Toro actually doesn't want to use CGI to create most of the creatures that came out of is head. So a lot of the monsters and other things that can be seen in the movie are real. They are suits and models. The work on the creation of these characters gives the movie a particular feeling, just like the original comic books did. Guillermo Del Toro's creatures are unique and really give an amazing look to the universe he creates. But one problem that came from this decision is that a lot of the visual effect seems outdated. But it really is worth-it to pass over this.<br/><br/>The story is great as well. It's not a simple war between good and evil as in most super-hero movies. Both sides are wrong, it's two points of view confronting, and Hellboy is at the border of both but can't turn the scales. The story talks about a prince, who knows that his world, the world of the creatures, is going to die because of humans. He want to take control of the most powerful army ever to conquer the human world, and save his kingdom. The B.P.R.D won't let this happen but its best agent, Hellboy, is more part of the other world. So which side will be given the right to live ? And who should decide that ?<br/><br/>I simply loved this movie because of its universe and the lot of conflictual points of view that are part of it. So I recommend this film to every fan of comic books that are disppointed by the way the actual super-hero movies go. And for everyone who wants a movie where everything is not black and white, but grey."
"Ruanek","1","14","27","18 July 2008"," One of the worst movies I've seen, total trash.
","The last movie I saw, In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale, nearly made me comment on it, then I decided not to. But I'm not letting this one slide. Makes one really wonder how some ""directors"" get the funding and presumably good actors and still manage to screw it up, whereas more talented newcomers create masterpieces with next to nothing. Seriously, the actors must be just in for the money. They can't need the money that badly, can they? Actors like these would most likely even sell their mothers if the price is right. But I'm digressing. This movie is bad in every regard, except maybe for the CGI. The humor of this movie is infantile at best, appealing only to toddlers, who also wrote the dialogs, as it would seem. The make-up for the elfs looks definitely like a mix of Stargate Wraith, Vampire, Zombie and possibly some other undead. Unfortunately, the only one warranting a mask isn't wearing any. Speaking of Selma Blair and her utterly pathetic acting - I find one scene particularly amusing, the one where she's acting like a schoolgirl on LSD while taking a pregnancy test. I think we all know that she is well beyond the age of showing such displays of exhilaration. In conclusion: avoid this piece of s**t at all costs, don't waste your time, money, sanity or even bandwidth. And don't buy the (hopefully never to be released) DVD to show it to your friends or family - unless you really, really, really hate their guts."
"tef89","4","15","30","31 August 2008"," Very disappointed
","The original Hellboy movie had atmosphere coming out of it's red ears, Hellboy II unfortunately misses this point entirely.<br/><br/>To begin with you're immediately hit with the stark voice change of the Abe character, this was a major mistake. The very essence of the Abe character is the way the voice is a mismatch to the heroic way in which he interacts in the many 'situations' - to change this voice for a generic one is a great over-sight and one which straight away puts you on the back-foot in terms of your anticipated enjoyment.<br/><br/>The initial scene of Hellboy as an adolescent looks cheap and feels cheap, both in terms of the acting and the way in which the young Hellboy looks, all adding to a feeling of impending dread that the films makers just don't 'get it'.<br/><br/>Moving onto the older Hellboy character and this too has suffered from a change for the worse. In an effort to introduce more obvious humour the character doesn't have the same touch to it, it's all very disappointing.<br/><br/>I was really looking forward to this film but unfortunately the opportunity to capitalise on the original movie's feel and atmosphere has been totally missed.<br/><br/>It feels like a cynical attempt to make a few more $$$ at the expense of a great premise and some great theatrical characters.<br/><br/>Please understand I'm in no way a comic book purist as in fact I've never even read the comic book version, but I am just someone who really enjoyed the first Hellboy film."

","I liked the first HellBoy & Guillermo del Toro was too good in Pan's Labyrinth! Which were the reasons for going to the movie with high expectations! Maybe that was the mistake,which left me hugely disappointed. <br/><br/>Good: CGI,few heartfelt moments of romance<br/><br/>Bad: All the characterizations were week,Especially Jeffrey Tambor's(Tom Manning).Tom is always pleasant to HellBoy and is always requesting HellBoy to simmer down, but is always being picked on by Hellboy.Tom Manning doesn't seem ever to be in control so I don't see why Hellboy should be so irritated with him!In the end even Johann Krauss gets angry with him!Maybe they thought that its the most easy way to add slapstick humor!<br/><br/>The initial hype for the Forest God was too much for it to simply be killed by gunshots to the head,whereas all it was able to do was grow and swing its arms!<br/><br/>Prince Nuada's reason for returning from exile to wage war on the human after several centuries is week, there seems to be no strong reason for him to begin the war again!<br/><br/>When Hellboy is fatally wounded,the Prince has the chance to just collect the piece of the crown and have his Golden army but he just leaves asking them to bring the piece!<br/><br/>The team agrees to go after the Prince to save HellBoy, which he is by his father , the Angel of Death(which seems to be just to add a plot for any future Hellboy movies).But even after he is saved they just want to give us more action, so they go after the Prince!<br/><br/>Princess Nuala seems to be always against the war but in the end when Prince Nuada stakes his claim to the Golden Army as the unchallenged heir she is silent as if it was to give an opportunity for the CGI team to show off with a fight sequence!<br/><br/>Verdict: Guillermo del Toro seems to be stuck at Pan's Labyrinth , Hellboy2 seems like just a bad Pan's Labyrinth hangover!<br/><br/>But if you like to watch meaningless impressive CGI action, Hellboy2 is not a bad choice for a pretty boring day. Otherwise it just leaves you disappointed.<br/><br/>why i have rated it 1/10 , is because it is disappointing to watch a good director like Guillermo del Toro completely miss the target."

Then you use your influential friends in the business and the promise of generating cashflow ""because it is a sequel anyways"" to blind any possible critics with dolar signs.<br/><br/>This is pretty much how Hellboy 2 must have been created. It is an awful movie, with bad acting, bad dialog, a horrible storyline, and fairly good special effects. Since the pace of the action is too slow, there are too many awkward dialogs, romantic scenes that do not add anything to the movie, and misplaced jokes, it fails in every aspect.<br/><br/>Only watch this if you have no problem watching mindless garbage that leaves no impression whatsoever."

"anniecavgh","10","8","14","13 July 2008"," The Ultimate Guillermo Del Toro Experience!!!
","This Film Had Everything Possible Known To The Fantasy Genre And More. The Story Was Superb and Heart Braking. The Wonderful Ron Perlman Did an Excellent Job as Big Red, along with his fishy partner Abe Sapien(played by the wonderful doug jones), the sexy pyro babe liz sherman(Selma blair), and the new comer Johann Kraus(voiced by the hilarious Seth Mcfarlane).<br/><br/>The Film Was ten times bigger than the first one, and the creatures were even more sophisticated, including the menacing Mr. Wink who was wonderfully made and performed, all of the creatures in the troll market were also hilariously created but the most impressive was the angel of death who was also played by doug jones. The detail on the character was beyond imagination and its voice was frightening and ghoulish, it was one impressive presentation.<br/><br/>Now even though allot of the characters in the film were puppets, there were several sequences that included an array of CG character, the golden Army to be precise. The sequence alone was epic! The twist was amazing and it shows the team working as one. Now one sequence that many thought would be the final battle was the fight between HB and the elemental god. That scene was in the middle of the film and it scale was huge. That scene served as just another mini boss fight but its scale was immense. The big baby gun was also a fun add on to hellboy's arsenal.<br/><br/>The writing was also a big plus, hellboy still has his puns and his funny quotes but the big surprise was abe's one liners that were just gut busting. there are so many things in this film that you might have to watch it twice to fully take in all of the story and character development.<br/><br/>Overall this film is probably the best comic book film. and it deserves high praise to the master himself Mr. Del Toro!!!! <br/><br/>10/10"

It made me laugh and even tear up a bit in the end (and hate humanity a little (i.e. the things prince nuada said was true)). I loved the settings, the characters, and the great fighting scenes!!! The only thing bad about this movie was that I didn't want it to end! It may seem cheesy at times, but only cause it's meant to be. See it for fun, not seriously. This movie will guarantee make anyone laugh at least once."

","Visually stunning, a much more intricate story than the original one, several truly laugh-out-loud funny scenes. Altogether an excellent movie! I enjoyed it way more than the first Hellboy. Comparisons to Pan's Labyrinth can be made, with a few similar characters and visual effects. Absolutely worth seeing! The CG scenes themselves were gorgeous too. The movie also was much more character driven with that enjoyable Hellboy humor, Hellboy/Liz/Abe Sapien love life, also nice that I never got the feeling it was being shoved down my throat. No lack of action here either. From Hellboy's leaping punches to an Elf Prince's furious attacks, there was plenty of eye candy to go around. My only complaint would be that within the first few minutes of the film I had this awful feeling that it reminded me very much of Men in Black, but that soon passed."

","This film is so disappointing, it felt that i was watching a crude lord of the rings in the beginning and then it started to turn into a crap Men in Black. The elf prince is not that menacing as the lead villain, i would be more scared of a cabbage patch doll!!! There was a lot of good effects and the creature make-up and designs were top notch but unless you have a good gripping story then i am afraid it counts for nothing. <br/><br/>The story line felt like you have seen it all before and knew what was round the corner, it lacked the lightning pace of a good film. The original Hellboy is far superior to this and a lot more entertaining, if they tried to flesh out the characters in this sequel then to me they have failed and introduced worse ones. <br/><br/>I really hope this is not heading down the Pirates of the Caribbean route as i do like Hellboy but not this well below average second offering."
"revolution-7","3","11","21","13 August 2008"," HeyBoll
","A lot in this movie is reminiscent of Uwe Boll's erm...opus. It's more expensive, the effects are better, but in all honesty, I can't truly find any talent in this Hellboy sequel. A sequel it really is, in that dirtiest meaning of the word. It just tries to cash in on a successful first, with mindless repeat of the recipe that used to work, only with differing quantities of some ingredients. <br/><br/>This movie lacks purpose. It's just another tall tale set in the Hellboy universe, a rather generic story offering no further insight into whatever magical world the supernatural heroes originate from.<br/><br/>In fact, the supernatural becomes the norm in this sequel. There are far less human beings, and far, far more props from ""Neverending Story"" walking around, being weird-for-the-sake-of-being-weird. Kinda like every faux medieval movie features midgets, a fair, or an Inn.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. These creatures are all fun to look at, but this just ruins the atmosphere, it's not a movie, but a showcase of what some CGI crew can do. <br/><br/>Remember the sequels to MATRIX? The first one played around with the idea that the viewer could be living inside a computer program, without knowing it. The sequels completely forgot this thought-provoking layer of the story. The first Hellboy toyed around with the idea that supernatural beings are somewhere, saving our existence from unimaginable evil beings from other worlds. Hellboy II feels like it went to this other world, rented a bad apartment and threw a cheesy party for the freakish neighbours. <br/><br/>Then, there's the emotion. Or the lack of it. Guillermo Del Toro is probably not some writing/directing robot who's only encounter with real life, love and loss is from watching movies... but he sure as hell writes/directs all the ""human"" scenes like a robot.<br/><br/>After watching all Guillermo Del Toro's opus, I am now pretty sure he simply can't manage the flow of his work. There's never a really impressive entrance scene, everything overstays its welcome ( be it a fight, or dialogue, it's always just too long ). Whenever there's supposed to be a climactic scene, Guillermo ruins it by doing something, and then some more, and then some more. Fights last for ages, dialogues repeat themselves, people die for hours, and talk for hours while dying. Guillermo ruins it by driving in the point. He just doesn't know how to do climax. He just hasn't got it. Just like this last few lines I wrote. I overdid it. Get it? If that wasn't enough, I'll just throw in a winking smiley face. Or a couple of 'em.<br/><br/>I suppose HellboyII will make a lot of cash, and a few things in this one point to another sequel. It's all OK, but next time don't let Del Toro do anything but the puppets."
"MBunge","3","7","12","20 August 2010"," I don't even want to think about how bad Hellboy III will be
","This may be one of the worst sequels in the history of cinema where the writer and director of the first film is still involved in the production. Hellboy II has far more monsters and special effects than its predecessor, but it has less of everything that really matters. Less intelligence. Less style. Less drama. Less charm. Less heart. This amazingly ill conceived movie is even in a different genre than the original Hellboy. Imagine The Empire Strikes Back as a musical or Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom as a comedy.<br/><br/>It is impossible for me to exaggerate how flawed and poorly executed this film is. In the first three minutes of the movie, it tells you how the story is going to end. Within the first 15 minutes, it tells you exactly how the bad guy is going to be defeated. The script takes a character from the first film and completely craps all over him, so it can replace him with a special effect that has such a pathetically stereotypical personality, it's something Mel Brooks would have come up with after he had three separate lobotomies. One of the basic concepts of the first movie is literally thrown out the window before the sequel is half over and then that change is forgotten about. The physical nature of one character is altered without any explanation. Dramatic plot threads are picked up and dropped like a thumbless juggler. And then there's the drunken monster karaoke, which believe me, is not as cool as it sounds.<br/><br/>The plot (which again, is essentially spelled out for you in the first three minutes of the film) concerns the old gang from the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense squaring off against an elf prince who wants to use an ancient weapon to destroy humanity. Hellboy (Ron Perlman), the demon who just wants to be accepted, acts more like Buddy Hackett than a super-hero. His pyrokinetic girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair) is an afterthought caught in a storyline out of a exceptionally dumb soap opera. The aquatic Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) spends the entire movie behaving like Niles Crane around Daphne, even though he's no longer voiced by David Hyde Pierce. The elf prince (Luke Goss) acts like he wants to be a contestant on ""So You Think You Can Dance"". He's got a sister (Anna Walton) who sets back the cause of elven feminism by about a thousand years.<br/><br/>The special effects and the hordes of creatures that populate this movie are nice to look at, but that's all. It's as if writer/director Guillermo Del Toro thought that as long as he made it visually interesting, no one would care that every other aspect of the film sucked ass. Sadly, he's right for some people.<br/><br/>Hellboy II is so different in so many ways from Hellboy that if you hated the first film, you might actually like this one. That is, if you also have no taste, read at a kindergarten level and are hopped up on goofballs. Let me be blunt. This movie makes Men In Black II look like The Godfather, Part II. Avoid this thing like a hooker with sores on her upper lip."
"katt_36","3","7","12","14 August 2009"," Dim-witted story, interesting visuals.
","This movie was horrible, I knew straight away after seeing commercials that it wasn't going to be good. It was corny. Seriously, when you add some singing into a movie like this you know you've hit rock bottom. The story itself was uninteresting and the jokes were horrifyingly boring and stupid.<br/><br/>The cinematography and the visual effects were good. It was nice visually - the different monsters/costumes/scenery and the fight scenes were well done. Hence I give it a 3 out 10. Rent it if you want brainless action and something pretty/cool to look at. But don't expect much out of it."
"iyeko","5","10","19","17 July 2008"," Disappointing
","So... Hellboy. I enjoyed the first film, true, not enough to bother buying it on DVD but I thought it was refreshing and fairly original for a comic adapted film so I thought I'd see the second. Overall I was disappointed with the second installment. Here is why.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro has a wonderful imagination. Many of his films have absolutely gorgeous imagery and beautifully designed characters. Unfortunately, Hellboy II suffers because of style over substance. The locations and visuals are lovely but the characters, script and acting seems 2-dimentional. There is no substance, there is no charm. The actual plot spent very little time on the 'Golden Army' itself... it instead concentrated on the new characters of Prince Nuada and Princess Nuala who are very generic characters and have little personality. Selma Blair as Liz seemed very flat and unemotional, Jeffrey Tambor was just annoying and despite his best efforts Doug Jones's voicework as Abe just couldn't reach the same emotional levels as David Hyde Pierce's work in the first film. The script was painfully predictable and completely unengaging. Although I did find the scene when Hellboy and Abe got drunk mildly amusing it seemed very cheap... The rest of the script was riddled with jokes that sadly weren't funny at all. I can understand that yes, many of the characters in the film were introduced in the first film but the fact that no time is spent on defining them, their personalities or motives means they all appear flat and uninteresting. The character Johann Krauss was infuriating. A German accented ectoplasmic robot voiced by Seth MacFarlane... Christ. I was actually glad when he was punched in the face and for one brief, wonderful moment it seemed that he was dead. Plus, his briefly mentioned backstory was a waste of time. Nobody cares because he is so tedious to watch. As for the plot, it is very repetitive. Silly wisecracks followed by a huge yet unoriginal fight scene followed by a romance scene which doesn't emotionally effect you at all, repeat, repeat, repeat. The romantic pairings of Liz/Hellboy and Abe/Nuala were poorly done. Liz and Hellboy are completely dysfunctional and you just can't help but not care about what becomes of their relationship in comparison to the first film. Abe and Nuala's connection was a nice idea but the writers seem to think that the fact that they are both psychic means that they don't have to develop it properly. Nothing clicks. The dubbing on the creatures was terrible, particularly in the market sequence and the opening scene with young Hellboy who looked disturbingly like a character from The Grinch. Not even John Hurt's brief performance could distract me from that atrocity. The films editing seemed lacking too. The wipes used on scene transitions drew far too much attention from what was going on the the fades in the final sequence as Nuada and Nuala die was cringe-worthy. There were so many inconsistencies that the entire film seemed strained and disjointed. One of the few positive things in the film that deserve mention is Doug Jones as the Angel Of Death who was mesmerising and eerily enchanting but the character was given so little screen time that it is forgotten by the end of the film. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed the original Hellboy I suppose it is worth watching but otherwise don't waste your money. Disappointing. 5/10."

I don't get it, did they think they would get away with only good CGI? The plot is terrible, Selma Blair is by far the worst actress I have ever seen, she has no facial expression,she does not portray any emotions and I already had this opinion on her before I saw this movie. I really can't understand how this movie has such a high rating.I guess all the nerds are voting. I tried to enjoy this movie...but its just not possible. Still I manage to put up with 50 minutes of this piece of crap, but then I started thinking, life is too short, do I really want to waste another hour of my life which I can't get back? No."

","As an avid fan of the comics and a lover of the director's (Del Torro) previous work, I was in high spirits about going to see this film after having seen all the cool previews and trailers, despite the fact that I didn't really care for the 1st film all that much.<br/><br/>This film sees Hellboy and the rest of the BPRD up against the Price of the Elves/Elfs I never remember which one its meant to be should have paid attention while playing AD&D role play when I was at school I guess. The king of the whatever wants to obtain all three parts to a golden crown that will allow him to take command of an indestructible army of golden machine warriors called the golden army. Whilst he is obtaining the parts to the crown, he draws the attention of the BPRD and thus Hellboy and the team with the notable addition of new team member, Johann Krauss (an endoplasmic entity inside a mechanised suit) have to come kick some ass in order to prevent this.<br/><br/>To be honest, as soon as the film started, I thought ""what the DEVIL (see what I did there?) is this?"" The kid playing a young Hellboy is as cringeworthy as the young Anakin Skywalker in Episode One! From then on, I wasn't chuffed but the film did pick up at points and feel more like the comic but maybe its just me this just wasn't Hellboy.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I think maybe if you haven't read the comics then this film is well worth a watch but speaking as a fan, I felt jipped. I can't actually believe that Mike Mignola (the comic author) would have let this go mind you he was a co-writer in the 1st film. The problem with this film and indeed the 1st is that it tries to appeal to a wider demographic by dumbing down the mystical and dark brooding feel of the comics, and instead replacing it with too many jokes, slap stick humour and the worst sound track I have heard in ages! Let me get this straight for you, this is how bad it is Hellboy and Abe (who has some how become the fish version of C3-PO) sing a love song duet over a girl Abe has only just met a few hours before hand!!! Also, Hellboy and Liz Sherman seem to have become a lovers couple now I have read most of the books and yes, there was tension between them in the comics. <br/><br/>The only saving graces of this movie were the really stunning special effects, from the costume and beast designs to the snazzy and well used CGI. Also I have to say Luke Goss as the Elf price, Nuada, gives us a strong performance filled with emotion and executed perfectly he continues to prove us all wrong as an actor. Also his martial arts skills seem to have excelled since his also impressive performance in Blade 2<br/><br/>For movie reviews, news and opinion like no other as well as the kick ass bi-weekly podcast check out www.fightrunner.co.uk"

"NavyOrion","3","15","32","11 July 2008"," No no no, wrong wrong wrong, bad bad movie!
","Imagine if all of Star Wars had been Jar Jar Binks. Think about the annoying kid ""Short Round"" from the second Indiana Jones movie. Remember for a second how cheated you felt after paying to sit through ""Men in Black II,"" ""Aliens III,"" and ""Star Trek V"". You get the idea.<br/><br/>This movie took a good gritty graphic novel (and pretty good first film) and screwed it up to appeal to the kiddie market. Instead of the tough but lovable demon we met in the first film, ""Hellboy II"" makes him more of a buffoonish cartoon character. Aside from a scene of gratuitous Tecate beer drinking (with the name on the can ALWAYS facing the camera, of course) and one ""I'm gonna kick his ass"" comment, I'm hard pressed to see how this received even a PG-13 rating. It's a bad sign when the high point of an action movie is (I kid you not) a Barry Manilow song. Let me repeat that: A BARRY MANILOW SONG.<br/><br/>Selma Blair is excellent in her return as Liz Sherman, but Ron Perlman is toned down way too much this time. Gone is the cynical, grumbling behemoth of the first movie, only to be replaced by a red version of Sully from ""Monsters Inc."" His love of cats, rather than being an amusing anachronism, now seems quite in character for what he has become, a p***y-whipped homebody, promising to try to clean up his act. The underlying threat is just no longer there.<br/><br/>The other characters fared no better. Sadly, the talented David Hyde Pearse, who in the original (unbilled) voiced Abe Sapien, has been replaced in the role by a C3P0 clone Doug Jones (who wore the blue tadpole suit in both films.) The always-tedious Jeffrey Tambor, freshly unemployed from the mercifully-canceled ""Welcome to the Captain"", was in WAY too many scenes playing, essentially, Jeffrey Tambor. Worst of all: Seth MacFarlane, who voices Peter Griffin on ""Family Guy"", turns in a ridiculously bad performance providing the voice of a faceless new German agent, Johann Krauss; honestly, the accent and inflections were so cringe-inducing, they would be questionable in a Scooby-Doo cartoon, never mind a major motion picture.<br/><br/>This could have been a good movie. The plot (an elf prince seeks to revive an indestructible golden army to renew an ancient war with humanity) was promising, and Luke Goss and Anna Walton (as the prince and his sister) both did good jobs with the roles (although their makeup was shamelessly copied from that of the Wraith aliens of ""Stargate: Atlantis"", and it would have been nice to see a few more elves other than just the two of them and their father.) <br/><br/>But execution is important too, and to be taken seriously, a movie needs to take itself at least somewhat seriously. This one didn't. With foolish performances, silly voices and sound effects, dumb stunt sequences (the baby-tossing scene seen in previews), and a cutesy dime-store soundtrack, ""Hellboy II"" never lets the audience believe that there's any real menace presented in the story.<br/><br/>Particularly if you liked the original graphic novel or the first ""Hellboy"" movie, you're going to be annoyed by this watered-down, Disney-esque sequel. Never mind the shameless foreshadowing of the plot of ""Hellboy III"", they never should have made ""Hellboy II"" if they weren't going to do a better job than this."
"DICK STEEL","10","11","22","11 July 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Hellboy II: The Golden Army
","I liked Guillermo del Toro's cinematic incarnation of the character so much that I had forked out good money to purchase the 3-disc Director's Cut edition of his 2004 Hellboy. Hellboy II: The Golden Army, starts off with a teenage Hellboy being told the legend of the said army, in a prologue that looked very much like something ripped from Lord of the Rings, perhaps Del Toro's wink at the audience that he's a worthy successor to Peter Jackson in taking on franchise with The Hobbit, dealing with elves, dwarfs and one crown to rule them all, split into 3 pieces in a truce between a mythical world and the humans, to maintain the peace between them, and to keep the Golden Army deactivated and at bay. It's something like the activation codes to a nuclear bomb, where once unleashed and the world tasted its ability, a tacit vow to never again use such destructive powers had to be kept.<br/><br/>Until of course you have those who crave power to come at an opportune time to seize what was thought to be rightfully his, with Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) staging a coup and in pursuit of his sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) to recover the last piece of the puzzle. But we can count on our big red devil to stand in his way right? Not quite. I thought this storyline had been played out fairly frequently, what with the last one of their kind being caught up in an unappreciative world. Think Superman, Spider-man, Hancock, X-Men and just about any typical superhero and you get the drift. For Hellboy's case it boiled down to something as banal as his looks and the lack thereof, putting a mirror in front of us and making us blush at how we generalize or accept people at first glance so long as they please our eyes, and being wary toward those with physical flaws.<br/><br/>But while I thought such themes would have been developed in depth here given its runtime, surprisingly it didn't. And for a lot of its subplots or not-too-subtle messages that tried to muscle its way through, such as us humans being deemed unworthy to inherit the Earth and other related environmental messages, they generally great brushed aside without providing much of a second thought after their introduction at one point or another. Are we looking for deep, profound exploration of themes, or an all round good time? Hellboy II tended to slant toward the latter, but does so by providing us some excellent characterization between the players, never mind if the villain Prince Nuada seem so one-dimensional.<br/><br/>What proved to be a riot here, is Ron Perlman's Hellboy, like watching an old friend come back again, one whose gruff exterior and sarcastic wisecracks betray the soft nature of his, especially toward his main squeeze Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) who returns with a chic hairdo and in better control of her powers, though somewhat still being underused. Abe Sapien (Doug Jones with his voice for the character intact) got provided an expanded role, and no doubt his fans will celebrate his being integral to the plot, especially his scenes of camaraderie with Hellboy. Here, their friendship got a little challenged by the introduction of a new superior from Germany, Dr Johann Kraus (John Alexander / James Dodd, voiced by Seth MacFarlane), a gaseous being kept inside a containment unit whose sticking by the book conflicts with Hellboy's settle-with-the-fist and laissez-faire attitude.<br/><br/>Following his Pan's Labyrinth, Del Toro again showcases his highly imaginative creature creations small and large, and I thought it was rather interesting that the creatures are always more than meets the eye, with threat levels you never could tell from their presentation. This movie becomes an expected special effects extravaganza with busy creations that would sit right up there with science fiction greats, and The Golden Army's reputation of being virtually indestructible, brings new and true meaning to the term autonomous computing. While I think some may gripe over the kung-fu fight scenes, since having Prince Nuada as a highly skilled martial arts exponent, the mano-a-mano between hero and villain brings to mind memorable fight sequences such as that in Once Upon A Time in China's Ladder Duel, and this one doesn't pale in comparison, which says a lot.<br/><br/>However the clincher for me in the movie is how very simple day to day misunderstandings and grappling with the notion of feelings, seem to baffle our heroes more so than the easily dispatched monsters. First love take centerstage, as does love that is already mature. And what I thought was a brilliant move, probably in prepping us up for a possible sequel, was a reminder of Hellboy's heritage and true origins, as well as how decisions made here would have repercussions and have set in motion some storyline to continue where certain scenes here had left off, especially with the brewing of to-hell-with-the-world mindsets setting in. I hope we don't have to wait another 4 years to see another Hellboy movie, especially if this one is as successful as its predecessor.<br/><br/>In a crowded summer box-office, I guess Hellboy would have made its way through via its niche audience, and there's little doubt that the this installment would have won over new fans as well. If one should summarize the movie in one sentence, then it will be that it is full of fantastical fun! Highly recommended!"
"Rectangular_businessman","10","5","8","4 July 2010"," Even better than the first one
","Talk about unlikely heroes. With skin the color of hell's red flames to match his horns and tail, Hellboy shouldn't be so damn compelling or likable as the center of attention. And with a daunting array of freaks, goblins, and strange creatures of the underworld, Hellboy 2: The Golden Army shouldn't work so damn well either, but it does, at least as well as the first Hellboy and possibly even better. It may not be a singular masterpiece; yet each electric, sumptuous shot by cinematographer Guillermo Navarro becomes its own masterpiece of makeup, special effects, and production design.<br/><br/>And Hellboy 2 pure pleasure; a giddy monster bash navigated through a dense maze of colorful characters, secret chambers, and underground kingdoms with a lot of the same popping, dynamic energy that Spielberg had at his best. This is a film that doesn't move, it bounces. del Toro wants to reconnect us with the childhood fear of the darkness, and he succeeds. But Hellboy 2 is also comfortingly familiar and nearly impossible to dislike. I felt like I had once again reconnected with old friends. There's Hellboy and his squeeze, Liz (a yummy Selma Blair), with Doug Jones reprising his role as Abe Sabien (while I miss the upper-crust intonation of David Hyde Pierce, Jones is good enough vocally it's hard to dwell on Pierce's absence for too long), along with a stressed and always very amusing Jeffrey Tambor as Tom Manning, the head of the (secret) Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense.<br/><br/>The opening sequence brings back another character from the first Hellboy, the great John Hurt as Professor Trevor Buttenholm, a Roman Catholic expert in the paranormal who first found the creature in a Scottish cave as the second World War came to a close. It is Christmas in 1955 and in a military base he reads to his adopted son the story of the the Golden Army, a fierce battle that took place long ago between human beings and the elves (stylistically the depiction of the battle reminded me a bit of the clay animation The Adventures with Mark Twain from the 1980s, and as with everything in the picture, it's a stunner). Young Hellboy is delighted with his father's storytelling but ironically refuses to believe that events described actually happened. Of course he's proved wrong. The humans and the elves once did go to war, and back in the present day Prince Nuada (English actor Luke Goss) of the Underworld is ready to wage war again with the human race, but can't until he acquires all the pieces of the crown that are necessary for spurring the army into battle.<br/><br/>In the midst of a picture with waves of green ooze, talking tumors, and hordes of tooth fairies, the beautiful, heart touching moments are perhaps the biggest thrill of all. I found the first Hellboy to be affecting but the emotional depth of the story is expanded here. The emotions are seamlessly woven into the film and are as potent as its kicky action. The most haunting occurs after Hellboy has demolished a huge, destructive green monster (after a well-written segment where he questions whether he should hurt a fellow freak in the first place) and he splashes to the ground, being reduced to nearly nothing. As life emerges from death (plants instantly spring out of the slain creature), del Toro slows the pace of the picture down and lets us bathe in the strange, ineffable beauty of the moment. I can't say I've ever seen anything quite like it. There's also a melancholy segment where Hellboy showers alone-bruised both physically and on the inside-and del Toro brilliantly plays ""Beautiful Freak,"" the title track from the Eels' first album. It's the smartest use of an Eels song that I've seen yet in a movie, and it makes for a tenderly empathetic moment That's not even the movie's most memorable musical scene: Hellboy singing along (plastered) to a Barry Manilow tune is certain to have that distinction. It's bizarre to be sure, but it works because Guillermo del Toro has such a firm command of the tone and mood throughout. When the Prince's twin sister Nuala (played by Anna Walton) escapes to the secret location of the BPRD as her brother tries to find her and the crown he needs to wage war, the moments between her and Abe Sapien are handled so deftly that it's almost as though we can feel their mutual attraction before they do.<br/><br/>Performances are mostly solid as well. Ron Perlman is Hellboy again and his performance is superior to the one he gave in the first Hellboy. His acting is less bombastic (slightly), and both his acting and the dialogue he's given have less of the world-weary sarcasm. What's remarkable is how easy Perlman makes it for people to like Hellboy. There are two strands running through his character, the ass-kicking warrior and the somewhat boyish outcast, and he balances both aspects. Selma Blair occasionally feels like she's overreaching in a way that she didn't in the first film, which was a touching display of aching sadness and longing and the best performance in that film. Mostly she's giving the right performance for the picture. The most surprising performance, for me, was Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane who does a very good as Johann Krauss, the deceased German (with a thick accent) who exists as a gaseous spirit in a containment suit and is sent in to command the others. As an ardent detractor of his show, I've always felt that he was a very limited vocal artist (which is only one of Family Guy's numerous flaws), but here he proves me wrong on that count.<br/><br/>""Hellboy"" is one of the most entertaining films that I've ever saw. Igive it 10 stars."
"gigan-92","10","5","8","9 April 2009"," Exceeded My Expectations!!!!!
","It is one of the greatest superhero films of all time. Luke Goss and Seth McFarlane are among the newest characters while Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Doug Jones and Jeffery Tambor all return. The acting is great and comical and the cast is perfect. Marco Beltrami doesn't return disappointedly but Danny Elfman doesn't let us down, delivering a thrilling score. I don't know what's more beautiful; the symphony as the dead Elemental blooms or as Nuada crumbles into a pile of golden brown stone. John Krauss is an interesting character and I can't wait to see him in the next film ( that is if he isn't transferred to Antarctica).The story surpasses ""Hellboy"" namely because we see 'Red' in the real world and it's a great ironic twist that the public doesn't view him as he'd so dearly hoped. We see his dreams shattered and Ron Perlman shows this just as I imagined it! The Golden Army looked incredible and the end battle was one of the film's highlights.<br/><br/>This film also expands the universe of Hellboy and I really enjoyed all of the vivid sets. The creatures are amazing, from the 'tooth-fairies' to the Elemental to the beautiful freaks of the Troll Market, all are truly wonderful. Guillermo really has earned the title ""visionary"". Wink is a marvelous beast and his battle with Hellboy is one of my favorite sequences in the movie. The brutality fits in nicely with the comedy I have to say and the chain fist was a plus most definitely. Prince Nuada's character is one of del Toro's best villains, with spectacular motive and an emotional appeal that in the end makes us pity the fallen warrior. Abe and Nuala's love story is great and the climax is a tragic moment. The comedy is fantastically funny, by far the funniest when a drunk Hellboy and Abe sing a Barry Manilow duet! That part was incredibly funny and one of my personal favorite sequences in the film. The song itself is honestly catchy and you know it's true. But the story still retained its serious moments, delivering the emotions precisely at the right moments. Such as when Hellboy met his ""angel of death"", a truly remarkable scene. The Angel of Death itself was stunning and the scene reminds us that despite his hero status, it is still his destiny to ""bring about the end of the world"".<br/><br/>Ron is simply at his best and my expectations for Hellboy 3 are now higher than ever, but one can only wonder: How exactly will a pair of Hellboy-Liz mutts fit into the story? Most likely Guillermo del Toro has something planned. Yep, other than ""Dark Knight"", this is my favorite summer flick. Totally exceeded my expectations!!!"
"PyroSikTh","6","5","8","28 March 2009"," Could've been so much more...
","I watched the first Hellboy and thought it was pretty good, so when I saw the adverts for this and noticed the outstanding visuals, I thought it definitely had to be watched. Where better to watch such visual fantasies than the cinema.<br/><br/>It started off far from satisfactory with the worst acting I've ever seen from a child actor, I'm sure they could've someone better, luckily, John Hurt was there to save it. From that point it started to improve. I loved Del Toro's vision of tooth fairies and the scenes in the auction house were chilling. The action was crisp and imaginative. I was impressed and couldn't wait to see more. The adaptation of the elves was fantastic. They looked so other-worldly, yet human and realistic. The scene in the throne room is one of my favourites in cinema history. Del Toro paid a lot of attention to the visual details. The main story was also very interesting, I'd have loved to have seen more of it, like in a spin-off epic on similar proportions as Lord of the Rings. The marketplace was astounding, I truly believed there was really a place like that, so full of life of weird creatures of fantasy that we know nothing about. The representation of the Angel of Death was absolutely fantastic, possibly my second favourite moment in cinema history.<br/><br/>However, I found too many characters on Hellboys side too annoying. They're supposed to be the good guys, I'm supposed to like them. I just found them pathetic and invigorating. Abe's hastiness to fall in love so quickly and surely just reminded me of those thirteen year old kids who think they know everything about love, and they really irritate me. Krauss's accent was ridiculous and his need to obey all the rules was ridiculous, the notion that he'd then go back on himself and disobey rules was just unbelievable. However, him vs Hellboy was definitely a highlight of the film and the character got kudos. The inclusion of Liz's pregnancy was fearfully predictable and cheesy. In fact, I think the only heroic character I did like was Hellboy. In addition, the end felt like it was a bit rushed.<br/><br/>So to wrap up my review; This could've been so much more. Cut out the cheesiness and ridiculousness and this could've been a fantastic fantasy epic. Cut out the fantastic visuals and epic storyline and this would've been good as a cheesy, generally entertaining film that doesn't have to make sense. Del Toro was trying to merge two completely different styles of movie entertainment and it just didn't blend. I would much rather it wasn't a Hellboy film, but a completely new, imaginative and visually stunning fantasy epic, but that's just me."

"warbonnet87","4","16","35","12 July 2008"," Once again $ signs replace creativity
","Very disappointing. I never understand why film makers who catch lighting in a bottle (like Hellboy 1) feel like that have to reinvent the wheel. Hellboy 1 was the perfect balance of good writing and special effects. Hellboy 2 is all effects with little if any substances. <br/><br/>Forget about a decent story line, instead Hellboy 2 is a collection of CGI fight sequences loosely (if at all) strung together. Don't expect any character development either, instead the film just 'cashes in' on all the work done in Hellboy one with nonstop one liners. Once again the film makers fail to realize that eye popping CGI effects are now expected and you actual need a story to entertain a crowd."
"ken_wilsonii","3","8","15","18 April 2009"," Big let down, dialogue was trite and storyline very thin
","Poor writing lead to bad dialogue and some very uninteresting scenes including the action sequences.<br/><br/>The special effects were good but many of creatures seem to just take on the look and feel of those ones from Pan's Labyrinth.<br/><br/>The elves in this movie do not even come close to what an Elf (we are talking Tolkien here) is about philosophically and or even as a race. This appears to be an attempt at a darker elf, but not carried off well.<br/><br/>The best character in this movie was the Prince elf, but his actions are in direct contradiction to him being an elf to begin with. Kudos to the actor that stuck out with this role and did a great job despite bad dialogue and ill-conceived storyline moments that left me wondering where the movie was actually headed..besides the obvious fight scene at the end.<br/><br/>Sorry, but this movies takes a wrong turn at the very beginning with a confusing opening show Hellboy as young and ..dare I say..dopey looking kid with no clue. <br/><br/>Another downside to this was the lack of David Hyde Pierce doing the voice over work for Abe Sapien. This oversight destroyed the character for me and left a rather dry rendition in it's place.<br/><br/>This movie is not really worth seeing, stick to the first Hellboy movie and no other. or get a different guy next time. Guillermo really is not that great of a director or writer..etc...<br/><br/>nuff said"
"tedg","Null","8","15","27 July 2008"," X-communicated
","The strategy here is obvious: discriminate from a dozen other summer movies by providing a more engaging character and more imaginative creatures.<br/><br/>Its with a bit of sadness that I am finding del Toro unrewarding. Its because I value deep film experiences so, and because as a class, Spanish-speaking filmmakers are head and shoulders above others in the values that matter to me: cleverness, reflection, emotional insight.<br/><br/>Del Toro is none of these. The story on him is that he is supposed to be a visually creative genius in the imagination department. Well, if he were, it would be an imagination focused on objects and not environments. This is a killer, because film depends on the creation of a world, and worlds are not the things in them. Its about the stuff that surrounds, governs, colors and produces those things and beings. Good plays can be based on characters, but good film always requires a world.<br/><br/>So okay, what about the beings? Are the characters different and deep enough for us to immediately see that this is different? <br/><br/>For my money, Red is drawn from pretty ordinary clichés. And the supposedly novel beings from this and ""Labyrinth""?<br/><br/>They're impressive just because someone made them, but they all seem to come from the rubber mask tradition even though the technology doesn't limit so. This man fails on both counts as an imaginative Mexican.<br/><br/>The one thing that I did notice and which was remarkable was the clockworks. His first movie (I think) was ""Chronos."" It had an object with watchlike gears that we would sail through. The same effect is used here in several areas. One is the credits, which usually tells you this defines the universe of the film.<br/><br/>Its in an incidental scene where an ectoplasmic being introduces his soul into the mechanism of a complex lock in order to divine the combination. (He succeeds, opening to another world.) The fight in this episode ends with a beast getting caught in part of a related machine.<br/><br/>And its the primary device used in the climax, sort of bridging from the clock that drives the universe to one that drives the mechanical army. It also spills into the machinery of the each golden soldier who is indestructible because of attunement to this celestial machinery. And it provides the physical environment for the showdown between hero and villain, with them having a conventional old fight while hopping among cogs and gears Chaplinwise. <br/><br/>The problems are: the vision is unoriginal, and the practical stage for the final fight is hugely clunky as if it were a Busby Berkeley stage. But its more than this. Its the only thing we have that is environmental. Its the only thing given that helps define how this imaginary world works. We have a prophet who gives Red's life back and tells of things that MUST occur. But none of it is related: the machines to each other, the machines to the determinism of fate, the machines to the cinematic situation.<br/><br/>Orreries are special in film. They work. This comes really close to being able to work, but the filmmaker didn't seem to see it.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"jessfaith-45971","10","3","4","21 January 2019"," One of the Best Sequels Ever Made
","I rented Hellboy 2 off of iTunes with high expectations. After I surprisingly fell in love with the first movie, I figured to give the sequel a shot. I was so excited to watch it and I couldn't stop thinking about it. When I finally got to see it, I was blown away. This movie is definitely on par with the original in my opinion.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman as Red delivers once more. I really enjoyed his interactions with everyone, especially with newcomer Johann Krauss. Red is amazing as always in any scene that he's in. Despite being hated by other people and being reminded of his destiny, Hellboy still proves that he has a heart of gold. I really liked how he was willing to spare the forest god and how he refused to kill Nuada even after the latter almost killed him. Red knew that his friend loved Nuala so he spared the prince's life. I also loved how he told Abe that he'd give his life for Liz. Red is still a true hero in the end.<br/><br/>Hellboy's allies are amazing in this sequel as well. While Myers is in Antarctica (hilariously said by Hellboy and Liz), Johann Krauss has come to watch Red and he doesn't disappoint. Krauss' by the book nature and German accent lead to some hilarious comedy. The funniest part was when he and Red are in the locker room together. Krauss pronounced 'focus' in a really funny way and then beat Red up which was funny because Krauss is technically a ghost. Agent Manning was a lot funnier in this film as well and Selma Blair's performance as Liz was spectacular. I really felt her pain, especially when she had to choose between Red and the world. Red's interactions with Abe was also great. Abe got more screen time which I loved. My fave scene in the whole movie was when he and Red sang 'Can't Smile Without You' together while thinking of their loved ones.<br/><br/>Nuada and Nuala were great characters too. Nuala was pretty but also brave, kind, and selfless. She gave her life to protect her new friends from her brother which I thought was very brave. Nuada is an amazing villain. Unlike most villains, Nuada does not simply want power by taking control of the Golden Army, he wants to reclaim the glory from what once was his home. He's also an extremely capable fighter and any scene where he battles someone, I got really excited. Nuada also cared for his sister and bodyguard Mr. Wink which was nice since many villains don't care for their henchman.<br/><br/>The visual were amazing in this movie as well as the fight scenes. My heart was pounding when Nuada fought Red and I almost cried when the former stabbed Red. The Angel of Death was very creepy and disturbing. The Golden Army itself was breathtaking. At first I thought, ""these guys aren't so bad"" when Red and Johann kept destroying them. When the army began to rebuild themselves, I was like, ""oh crap."" The song ""Can't smile without you"" appropriately fits this movie as Liz and Red need each other while Abe loves Nuala.<br/><br/>I wish there was third film to continue the story of Red becoming a father and being with Liz. However, I fear that if a third film would happen, then we'd all have to say goodbye to Red in the context that he dies. The Angel told Liz that if Hellboy lives than she will suffer greatly. I interpreted this as that Red will die. This is due to the fact that Liz was willing to give up the world for him and that if he dies, she will suffer. I feel that Red would die from either two ways: 1). he turns evil and Liz has to kill him or 2). he gives his life to save Liz and his friends or to stop himself/the bad guy from killing all of humanity. This is just a theory but I do not want to watch Red face death once more. As far as I'm concerned though, this sequel was amazing and Red will live happily ever after with Liz as a father.<br/><br/>PS. the scene in the beginning was great. Red was just like any other child on Christmas eve and professor broom is always so kind and wonderful. What else can I say besides, ""I can't smile without Red."""

","The best character in the film is Prince Nuada. When he's on screen it's very exciting. Much as I love Ron Perlman, Luke Goss had the better part. For one thing, he stood for the survival of his race, while Hellboy really didn't stand for much. Humans? They're bound to turn on him, and what have they done for him anyway. Even having John Hurt as a dad doesn't make up for being orphaned.<br/><br/>The film was overall well acted and slick, a la Hollywood. I think most credit should go to Guillermo Del Toro, who wrote and directed. The creativity and imagination that drew up Nuada and his milieu leads one to a truly magical place."

","It deserves to be seen first and foremost for del Toro's unleashed imagination - the Golden Army rulz indeed, by contrast with the terracotta cohorts from the unwatchable ""Mummy 3"". Some of the characters are pretty inspired - mainly Krauss, with his ""ectoplasmic schwanshtucker"", the trio composed by the versatile Doug Jones, and the elven twins - still, I can't not wonder: what will Guillermo do, when the world will grow bored with his thread-thin chinless, nose-less and palm-eyed (or, as here, wing-eyed) humanoids? Will he invent something original, or will go on like this to no end? <br/><br/>The weak points lay in the formulaic script (a narrative structure mathematically well-behaved, but with no ineffable at all) to the point of numbness, and the cheap humor, stiff to the point of dumbness. Plus, of course, the same old warmed-up soup of the fantastic heroes living among us as if it was the most natural thing on Earth - it works well in he Marvel series, since there it's been part of the pulp conception since its inception, in ""Hancock"" it was also tolerable, due to the witty humor, but it's already too much to show AGAIN AND AGAIN all kind of cyclops, godzillas and Ganymede vestals being interviewed live at C.N.N.<br/><br/>And, of course, the Hellboy himself. Ron Perlman has as much acting acumen as a wardrobe - fortunately, the filled-down stumps of his horns, too big for such a never used facial appendage, distract the attention from his irritating frown; at least, most of the time!"

"olesd","6","4","6","13 November 2008"," Think of it as a Spin off
","This is not Hellboy 2. Much like Spiderman 3 is very difficult to accept as having originated from the same director and writer, Hellboy 2 plays out more like a made for TV movie adaptation of the Hellboy series with an incredible budget. The pacing is not the same, I don't recognize any of the characters even though they're played by the same actors, every interesting and subtle idea has been scrapped or dumbed down, the music is more annoyingly bombastic, the atmosphere is shot to hell and where once was moody shades of blue and deep shadows have been replaced with garish lights. This is to Hellboy 1 what Tim Burton's Batman was the Batman Forever. And oddly enough, it holds together more then it falls apart. This is some...no...this IS the most inventive, realistic, and gorgeous creature work I've ever seen in a film. I just wish it had been in another film where the 'heroes' weren't all arrogant, pugilistic, drunken jerks, the story had some semblance of progression, and the character moments and fantastic sequences were investigated for real emotion and power, not played for laughs or melodrama. Characters don't make stupid decisions in this film because they're stupid. They make them because they're greedy, lustful, lazy, or prideful; not the ingredients for heroes I can care enough about to watch them all the way through without hoping for the way more interesting and emotional villain to cut them into equal thirds so they'd stop whining. This film is spectacle against all reason or logic, a film that literally breaks the rules because it will say one thing, then contradict itself moments afterward. Sacrificing the world for love is alright? Well, not when you do it the WRONG way. Watch this movie once and you'll soon pick out the gorgeous, flabbergasting, magnificent scenes that are unique to this film and wonders to behold. You'll also find the scenes of contrived emotion, blatant unfunny humor, truly weird in jokes that take center stage, characters acting out of character, illogical occurrences, and the surprisingly mean spirited bits of this film which haven't gotten any better with repeated viewing. Once those are found you can fast foreword and rewind to taste to enjoy all the imagination and innovation this movie has to offer, and wish like me it had been pledged to a better story and a better film."

","""Hellboy 2"" comes in the middle of a superhero sandwich, what with last weeks ""Hancock"" and next week's already proclaimed king of summer ""The Dark Knight"". I'm curious as to the legs this movie will have. The first one did OK, though I seem to recall a mixed reaction to it. The first one came out in April though, away from all the summer blockbusters. Since that first film, director Guillermo Del Torro has made somewhat of a name for himself with Pan's Labyrinth (tho I was one of the few who thought it was overrated) and he seems to be primed to become the next big thing in Hollywood. A mainstream hit would do wonders for him. I'm also interested in Ron Perlman, the man behind the Hellboy mask. He was the best thing about the first movie, sympathetic and cynically funny, and I feel this franchise should turn him into a star, or at least a better known name. All this was going through my mind this weekend as I entered the doors to see ""Hellboy 2"". <br/><br/>This second installment begins with an ancient tale of truce between humans and fantasy creatures. King Balor of the fantasy creatures created a golden army controlled by his crown but he was so ashamed at the result that he had the army hidden away, the crown destroyed into three pieces, and a peaceful resolution was settled. Jumping ahead to present day, his son, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), is appalled at what the humans have done to his father's land and he seeks the pieces of the crown to control the army and take the land back. This is a job for the team at the ""Bureau for Paranormal Research"", the amphibious Abe (Doug Jones), pyrokinetic Liz (Selma Blair), and big red, i.e Hellboy (Ron Perlman). Just they have problems of their own. No longer sure that Agent Manning (Jeffrey Tambor) can control the team, Washington has sent by-the-book Special Agent Johann Krauss (Seth McFarlane), who I'll describe to the best of my ability as white steam in a Scuba suit (he's also apart of the creature world if you haven't already guessed). With the help of Nuada's sister (Anna Walton), the team seeks to stop the Prince before he can get his hands on the army. <br/><br/>""Hellboy 2"" is a minor entry in a big budget summer slot. It has its moments but it just doesn't have the overall gravitas of your usual big bang popcorn flick. There are a few things I liked, the biggest is that it's thankfully never boring. Like the first movie, this doesn't take itself too seriously. There are a few really funny tongue-in cheek moments, some of the best come from a scene in a troll market (""I'm not a baby, I'm a tumor"" is a great line by the way) and visually Del Toro proves himself a talent as well, showing us evil looking trolls, demonic looking angels, and a whole slew of mechanical soldiers. <br/><br/>Just even with all this going for it, I can't think of one scene that excited or thrilled me, and I can think of a few, including a gigantic plant-like creature, that actually turned into gigantic let-downs. The villain is introduced as very quick and agile and he actually excited me at first but the movie gives him very little to do until the finale, and when that finally does come, it seems like he's being held back. And the other fights just seem like stuff you would find in any standard creature feature. A lot of clobbering but nothing especially cool. The plot on this one is a little by the numbers, sort of a CSI: Paranormal, and there are two romantic sub-plots involving Hellboy and Abe which, other than a funny scene where the two drink beer and sing Barry Manilow, don't really add much. But I'm an action guy and the lack of ""wow"" is no-doubt the films biggest flaw. <br/><br/>The actors don't seem to be having as much fun this time around either. Ron Perlman does the bad-ass thing and quips well, Seth McFarlane (yes from Family Guy) gives a very comical German accent for Krauss, and Jeffrey Tambor offers a few comedic bits but the rest of the cast is pretty wooden, Selma Blair being the biggest perpetrator as she holds a glum and bored look on her face through the entire movie. It's too bad that they didn't have David Hyde Pierce back for this one because Doug Jones' voice really threw me off. And while I enjoyed most of the movie's overall cheesiness, the opening scene featuring boy-hood Hellboy just made me cringe and hope that he would go away soon. <br/><br/>He thankfully does, but all for the purpose of presenting a mixed bag of impressive visuals, some funny moments, but overall no real excitement. In looking back at my review for the first movie, I noticed I said the same thing. ""Hellboy 2"" paves the way for a third installment and I'm sure I'd be interested in seeing it but by this point I'm wondering if I'll ever be truly impressed by these movies as a whole."

","I saw this last night at an advanced screening in NYC. I wasn't as good as the original but I enjoyed it a lot. I felt like there wasn't that much action in it but it was still very entertaining. They spent to much time on the romances in the film. The most impressive thing about the film were the creatures. They look like they are right out of pan's labyrinth. If you liked the first one you will most likely like this one it is worth watching. I will probably see it again some time.

"jpriest75","5","6","11","2 June 2009"," A Great Story Crumbles
","I just want to start off saying that I thought the first Hellboy film was an amazing accomplishment, complete with a sturdy story, stunning visual effects and acting that didn't go overboard like most comic books films. Having said that, I thought that The Golden Army was a monumental disappointment.<br/><br/>Selma Blair's character pulled a 180 in this film when compared to her performance in the first. From her unnecessarily ridiculous hair-cut to her less than satisfying acting, she completely downgraded everyone else around her. I haven't had the luxury of reading any of the Hellboy books yet, but if she had the same hair-do in the comics, please comment and tell me why.<br/><br/>Once again, I'm not entirely sure if he was in the comics, but Johann Krauss ruined the entire film for me. He had no significance; contributing absolutely nothing to the story and having the hilarity level of about a made-for-TV Disney channel movie. Please, for the love of God and all that is holy, why was this unimportant, uninteresting and downright inexcusable character allowed any screen time? <br/><br/>People who are used to watching new and experimental films during this modern era of cinema must learn to not be so black and white about what they see. A movie needs more than witty action banter and showy special effects to be worth a move ticket. And though I have seen much worse, don't get me wrong, The Golden Army just didn't measure up."
"athena24","4","6","11","26 April 2009"," Lacks the charm of the first movie.
","First of all, I have to say that, If I were 10 years younger, I'd probably rate this movie 6 or 7. Mainly for the great visual effects and a quite awesome action.<br/><br/>If 'Hellboy : The Golden Army' was a standalone movie, or if I didn't see the first one, I'd say that something lacks in this movie. Something that make this movie very childish. But after seeing the first one, I know what this movie lacks. It lacks the Hellboy character.<br/><br/>What makes 'Hellboy' different from other super-hero movies is the character of Hellboy. Cool, quite egoistic, funny ... . His character and charm applied to the scenes he's in. However, in the second movie, it's quite the opposite. The scenes are built to fit Hellboy's character. For instance, it seems that the whole contribution of the 'Johann Krauss' character was that Hellboy could mock on his German accent.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes were quite ridiculous: 1) When the paranormal bunch went to Prince Nuada's den they accidentally bumped into a creature that healed Hellboy, the emphasis is of course on accidental. 2) In the first scene of the 'good guys' against the 'little eating creatures', the humans FBI agents just stand still and shoot ( and await to be eaten ). They don't try to run or to avoid those creatures. Worse, is that no one of the superheroes there tries to do anything to avoid their death. 3) There supposed to be 70 golden warriors, though in the end, their number is close to 70,000.<br/><br/>There are few more but, I'll settle with the above.<br/><br/>I don't think that kids will notice the flaws I mentioned. So, probably they'll love it. Even more than the first one."
"deathscythe_42","10","6","11","15 July 2008"," More Exciting Than the First Hellboy!
","I was a fan of the first Hellboy but I always kind of understood why it wasn't considered a blockbuster. It was kind of cheesy and had room for improvement, but I still found it to be a very fun film with good special effects and action.<br/><br/>Well, Hellboy II: The Golden Army is certainly a notch or two above the first one. In fact, it was, in my opinion, about as good as action/adventure/fantasy movies get.<br/><br/>The plot was intriguing, the acting was very good, the makeup and sets were fantastic, the visuals were very impressive, it was well directed, and the action/fight scenes were very exciting and well done! Of course possibly most important of all is the characters. A couple of returning characters are given more dimension in this film, and the newly introduced characters are a great addition to the ensemble. Seth Macfarlane is fantastic as Johan Krauss, and I found the new villain to be a little deeper and more interesting than the villain from the first hellboy.<br/><br/>This is definitely a great summer film that action fans will not wanna miss!"
"jedi-jones","8","8","16","13 July 2008"," Exceptional action, special effects and humor!
","I loved this movie! It's the best action-adventure I've seen this year, more entertaining and satisfying than Indiana Jones 4, Iron Man, Hulk 2 or Speed Racer. I'm not a Hellboy fan of any kind. I don't remember much about the first movie, except that I thought it was passable entertainment. It looked great but the story seemed a bit clunky and the action scenes weren't as structured and well-paced as I like. I had no desire to watch it again any time soon. Hellboy 2 is on another level entirely. This one I can't wait to get on DVD and watch again.<br/><br/>The best thing about Hellboy 2 is that it captured some of the rare magic of those great genre mashups, Ghostbusters and Men in Black. It follows much more in the tradition of those films than anything from the superhero genre. It had the clever mix of science fiction, fantasy, horror, action and comedy that made those movies such entertaining blends. These movies are very hard to pull off, as the terrible sequels to MIB and GB demonstrated, even though they were made by virtually the exact same people. There was a point in Hellboy 2 when I realized you could have easily substituted the Ghostbusters in for the ""paranormal investigators"" in this film (you have the cynical one, the intellectual one, the emotional one and the common sense one), and not had to change much else about the film to make the story work. In this case the comparison is a well-deserved one. Although comedy is not the focus of Hellboy 2, the contrasting characters were clearly designed to work as a comedic team. There are many good laughs intermingled with the action of this film, often provided by Hellboy's deadpan reactions to the insane events happening around him.<br/><br/>The action scenes of Hellboy 2 are exceptional, perfectly paced and masterfully staged, blowing away anything we saw from Hulk and especially Iron Man. They're as good as the best Indy 4 action scenes but here you get a whole movie full of them (an early scene involving little man-eating creatures is coincidentally similar to Indy 4's most exciting scene). There are no over-stylized sequences where you feel like a director is trying to pump up a standard fight scene with meaningless camera action. Del Toro only uses camera and editing flourishes to smartly enhance and emphasize key dramatic moments in his scenes. The villains of Hellboy 2 make for particularly effective threats. There are times, reminiscent of past great action epics like Terminator 2, where you simply can't figure out how the heroes could possibly defeat them. That's a terrific way to make you identify with the heroes, adding an important psychological element to the battles. You are not just watching a spectacle but you feel like you're inside the action. You're not just emotionally concerned for the characters but also intellectually trying to figure out what they're going to do next.<br/><br/>Del Toro shows similar deftness in his handling of the movie's special effects. There isn't any gratuitous or overdone CGI, like the entire Mummy 3 trailer seems to consist of. It seems like Del Toro tries to use practical effects as often as feasible, only using CGI where necessary. The uses of different effects techniques seem to blend seamlessly here. Audiences actually seem to be having trouble distinguishing where the physical effects end and the CGI begins. I'm not a knee-jerk CGI basher, but I do dislike bad CGI just like I do any bad special effects. Speaking of which, both Hulk movies would have been better if they had the kind of special effects quality control on the Hulk that Del Toro demonstrates on every single one of his numerous creatures in this movie.<br/><br/>The cast of characters in Hellboy 2 is a wonder to behold. Based on this movie, Del Toro ought to be drafted to direct the new Masters of the Universe film. Here you have a similar blending of characters seemingly inspired by every pre-existing work of science fiction, fantasy, fairy tales, classic creature features, pro-wrestling, you name it. There are elves, fairies, trolls, robots, ghosts, tiny critters, giant monsters, shape-shifters and creatures made of rock, plant, air and wood. You even have a guy with a zany rocket-launching metal fist that looks like something straight off of a He-Man action figure. Yet none of this ever becomes overwhelming, confusing or over-the-top. There is an efficiency to how Del Toro shows you what you need to understand about his universe without wasting time on unnecessary exposition. He respects your intelligence and has faith in your imagination.<br/><br/>Hellboy 2 is ultimately an action and special-effects extravaganza. You shouldn't go in expecting great character development or subtle messages about the problems in today's world. There is a solid central plot that drives the movie from beginning to end, stemming from the villains and their dastardly, imaginative scheme to take over the world, just when you thought there weren't any more original ones to be thought of. All the main characters have clearly defined physical and personality traits that add color to the movie. But as far as the personal lives of the characters go, they are dealt with in a handful of smaller, mostly perfunctory subplots (that interconnect with the main plot at key moments). This movie isn't on the level of, say, Spider-Man 2 or Batman Begins where you could remove all the action scenes and still have a great character story. The main purpose the quieter, dialogue-driven scenes serve in this movie seems to be to give you a breather between the many big action scenes. But those scenes are so spectacular that it's unlikely you'll find yourself wishing the movie was any different. This is an excellent entertainment in a year that so far has mostly provided only so-so ones. Hellboy 2 is the science-fiction-fantasy-horror-action-comedy that you may not have known you were waiting for."
"TOMNEL","6","10","22","12 July 2008"," Artistically this is on par with Pan's Labyrinth. Too bad everything else failed because of this.
","Going into a Guillermo del Toro movie, you should know that the visuals are going to be the highlight of the film. The first Hellboy film had great visuals, though not quite as great as this. But with that said, the first Hellboy achieved so much more than this did. It was funnier, less corny and clichéd, and the villains were much more menacing than the villain here, who's no more than a guy with a spear, and an army of unnecessary robots. The first was pretty good in every way, this one had the eye candy, but offered very little else.<br/><br/>After botching a secret operation, Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and the crew are finally noticed, and this secret group of ""freaks"" is no longer a secret, and they are known to the public. Liz is also pregnant but doesn't want to tell Hellboy. Meanwhile, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), is trying to claim his right to be king. In order to be, he needs the three pieces of this crown, one that his sister has, one that he stole from a museum, and one his father, who he killed, had. Hellboy, Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), Liz (Selma Blair), and Johann Krauss (John Alexander, James Dodd and Seth MacFarlane), a man's soul trapped in a robot who was brought in to keep Hellboy under control, must stop Nuada from retrieving all three pieces of the crown, which allows him to control the Golden Army, and eventually take over the world. Abe Sapien meanwhile has fallen in love with Nuada's sister, who has an odd connection to her brother...what physically happens to him, happens to her. They must stop him and save the world.<br/><br/>The first negative for me was the villain here. It's just an elf, who has the same build as a human, and could die just as easily. He was no threat ever. Even when he had his Golden Army, it never was a threat. The Golden Army was just a bunch of braindead robots who liked to smash the ground. There was never a moment where I thought someone could be in harms way. The characters have been dumbed down a level and turned into comedians. Abe has been made more human and was even dumbed down, one of the dumbest scenes being where Hellboy and Abe sing Barry Mannilow together. It wasn't cute, it wasn't funny, it was just really stupid.<br/><br/>The story was bad. Mr. del Toro went for an all out visual feast and because of this he compromised the story. Elements didn't make sense, and parts of the movie that felt like they should have some impact didn't. They were all there for the audience to say, ""Wow! Look at that!"", but I found myself saying ""Huh?"" more than anything else. Hellboy fights these imaginative creatures. Instead of making a movie on this, maybe Guillermo should have written a book with all these fantastical creatures he thinks up. At least it would have made more sense.<br/><br/>Now, onto what I did like. I've said it all throughout, this was a lovely looking film. The direction was stellar, the action scenes were well choreographed, the creatures, though pointless to the story, were very cool to look at. The CGI wasn't amazing, but luckily most of the creatures are puppets, costumed characters, and lots of make up. The musical score was also really beautiful. I had just re-watched the first Hellboy prior to watching this, and the first film's music was not that great, where this one had some fantastic music, that should've been saved for a better flick. I wasn't surprised to see Danny Elfman's name in the end credits, and the music did add to the movie, and made it a small step better than it would have been.<br/><br/>Anyone who says this is director Guillermo del Toro's greatest accomplishment in film making, probably hasn't seen Pan's Labyrinth. Where del Toro failed here in the writing department he succeeded in the direction, and he can write good screenplays. Too bad his sole purpose in writing this was to go wild with the visuals.<br/><br/>My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 120 mins. PG-13 for violence.<br/><br/>*Final complaint. Why did they make Hellboy such an ugly kid? Geez, was he stupid looking."
"blackasp98","10","7","14","17 July 2008"," Fantastic
","This definitely out did hell boy 1, i enjoyed this film for the intense characters that were truly out of the ordinary. Seeing the troll market full of characters of different species and races of the underworld gave it a very rare look of us seeing how the unsee able lives. Much like us in some respects but with a certain chaotic feel of being in a realm where only creatures are only allowed. And if one human enters, instant death albeit except Sherman. mainly because creatures can sense other creatures with unique gifts or powers. And the prince and his sister, regal to the end, and even though the prince wanted to reclaim the upper world as his own he still kept to the rules of protocol all except the final battle. With a self sacrificing sister taking her own life to end his, keeping the golden army at bay forever from Sherman's help. I have to say this was Ron perlmans better roles in his career, i like the hell boy franchise and how its gotten much bigger and better over the last few years. As we remember when Ron was the beast in the famed TV series opposite Linda Hamilton, we can see that Ron's persona fits his role perfectly, using slapstick comical quips and real butt kicking techniques to get the job done. But what was a refreshing new character was Johann Krause, the ecto plasmic by the book individual who let his hair down when it was needed. He was a very fine addition to the team i hope if there is a next hell boy, they will include Johann again. And hopefully seeing both Sherman's and hell boys kids growing up to be like mom and dad,"
"zetes","8","7","14","13 July 2008"," Amazing to behold, but the script is mediocre
","The ads for Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy sequel declare the director ""a visionary"", and I honestly can't argue that at all. Pan's Labyrinth contains some of the most gorgeous imagery of any fantasy film. Hellboy II, I would argue, goes even bigger, with its undoubtedly much bigger budget. For once, here's a summer special effects movie that makes me think ""WOW!"" There are a lot of fantastical creations to be seen, from giant trolls to fearful demons with eyes on their wings. Unfortunately, much like my reaction to Pan's Labyrinth, all the gorgeousness is pretty much for the purpose of nothing. The script is very formulaic when you boil it down, and it occasionally hits points that make little sense. For instance, there is a classic comic book moment where Hellboy helps a crowd of human beings but is then accused of being the villain when it couldn't be more obvious that he just saved everyone's life. It didn't take me too long to realize that, aside from the awesome character design, I wasn't identifying with these characters much at all. I would still highly recommend the film to people looking for some dazzling visuals and some good action sequences."

"commander_zero","4","5","9","16 July 2009"," Guillermo, what the Hell happened?
","If you had never seen the comic, 2004's Hellboy was a fast-moving and funny introduction to the tough-talking, cigar-smoking title character and his fictional world—a world in which a multitude of supernatural forces, some of them malign and jealous of humanity's world domination, are constantly watched, monitored and occasionally battled by Hellboy's sponsor, the US government's ""Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense."" <br/><br/>Hellboy II: The Golden Army has virtually all the same talent on board, yet comes off as a hollow and unfunny parody of the first film. For every original touch — the rise and fall of the huge plant monster that the elf prince summons to kill Hellboy — there is a blatant rip off such as the Troll Market, obviously inspired by Harry Potter's Diagon Alley, and the walk through BPRD headquarters, so full of suited agents subduing unruly creatures that you expect Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to show up dressed in black. For every spectacular visual effect — director/screenwriter Guillermo del Toro's wonderful fairies and monsters such as the villain's hulking sidekick Wink (the Fantastic Four filmmakers should check out these makeup artists if they ever want a better-looking Thing)— there is a scene of appalling low comedy, such as Hellboy being beat up by (protoplasmically-possessed) locker doors, or his love-song duet with the elf-queen-smitten Abe Sapien. It is as moments like these, like last year's other franchise-ending turkey, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, that one becomes acutely aware of watching guys in suits. The actors are as good as ever, but the dialogue is rotten, the motivation is thin and Jeffrey Tambor, as the BPRD's fussy and bureaucratic director, is completely wasted.<br/><br/>Del Toro can be a brilliant writer/director. Like Tim Burton — whose filmed oeuvre is also wildly uneven — he understands how important fairy tales, monsters and myths are to maintaining a healthy imaginative life. Like Burton, he also has an extravagant visual sense; del Toro's monsters are as beautiful as they are scary. But even brilliant filmmakers have their failures — for every Pan's Labyrinth, del Toro has made a Blade II, but whatever his faults have been in the past, tedium has not been one of them. I walked out of Hellboy II twenty minutes before the ending, something I usually only do with Peter Jackson films, so perhaps it is not good news that del Toro will be writing and directing The Hobbit. The present film sets the viewer up for a Hellboy III, in which, if the series is not going to descend into self-parody that mixes bad jokes with epic length, we can only hope that del Toro will return to the top of his form."
"drkallianc1","3","5","9","31 August 2008"," Worse Then I Expected... And That's Saying Something
","I walked into the theater not expecting more than an average film at the absolute best, and I was thoroughly disappointed. The story was exceptionally flimsy, it was more-so set on something that should have been a side-story at best and the fight scenes were short and choppy. I mean, there were two fights with creatures that should have been big time bosses, but they were dead in a few short minutes and even the final boss was taken out relatively quickly. Not to mention the poor acting, the abundance of 2-d characters, and the there were multiple times when the solution was a no brainer, but it took the characters way too long it figure it out.<br/><br/>There were a few moments of saving grace for this film, but they were few and far between. Like there was at least one moment of the film that genuinely made me feel something other than boredom and the beginning wasn't completely awful. Also, any of the original cast plays there roles just fine and Ron Pearlman once again plays the perfect Hellboy, which is certainly a welcome reprieve from the other casts poorly played roles.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie attempted to ignore anything on artistic and focus on being purely entertaining, but fell flat on both accounts. The first Hellboy was much much better. I must say that this film was even worse than Hancock (which, before this film, was the worst movie of the year in my book), at least in Hancock we got good acting and a good opening.<br/><br/>A 3 out of 10."
"gtbarker","3","5","9","28 August 2008"," A big disappointment
","Having really enjoyed the original I was really looking forward to Hellboy II. But I have to say I was very disappointed. Gone were all the clever touches from the original like the indestructible demons and despicable baddies and were simply replaced by fancy but sterile fight sequences and rip-offs from successful film franchises. The troll market was obviously taken straight from Harry Potter's Diagonal Alley, there were also strong inferences taken from The Lord of the Rings, The Matrix and the bad guy was a straight rip-off from Stargate Atlantis' Wraith baddies. So from an original which was fresh and original we get a sequel which is a one-paced run of the mill actioner, made up pastiches pinched from other people's work which just never really got going."

The white haired guy was all the way annoying and he kept schwinging throughout the entire film. Every time he touched his sword, moved his sword or looked at it it ""schwinged"". Somebody get those foley artists under control. I handle swords, axes and edged weapons all day and I can never get them to schwing--kidding--.<br/><br/>Positives: Great production values, art design and great SFx plus the white haired guy's hulking sidekick was done very well as a guy in a monster suit and would have been ruined had he been cgi-ed. I just could not connect with this Hellboy sequel. I sat there like a cold dish of puss.<br/><br/>Del Toro seems to have gone the big jumbo size Hollywood route on this one. That fresh kind of look and feel of the first Hellboy seemed to be missing in this one. Also the build up to the Golden Army scene was so anti-climatic.<br/><br/>That's my two cents."

I wanted to stab myself in the ears with ice picks to stop the pain of hearing the wretched script of vomit assaulting my brain. I actually feel dumber after having seen this movie. Whereas Del Toro is a gifted and artistic visual director, Im convinced he ate an entire bottle of Will Ferrels ""crazy pills"" of Magatos while creating this so called plot. Even Barry Manilow would beat Del Toros butt for using his music to make this dung bomb of a movie even worse. Maybe if the audience could drink cases of Tecate beer, did anyone notice the dozen scenes blatantly hammered into your faces of that Mexican rust water of beer?! Anyway, perhaps if you were blindly drunk, and in a black out, you could enjoy this Ebola virus of a movie.....although even Ebola has a purpose unlike this movie. Boy...this movie was certainly Hell to watch. I wish there was a way to erase the stink of creative death this movie injected in my brain. This isn't as harsh a review as Id truly like for it to be...because I cant use that kind of language here. I can say, if you really really really hate and loath someone and want to punish them mercilessly, then take them to see this movie and chain them to their seat and put toothpicks in their eyes to make them watch the entire movie!

","I liked the first ""Hellboy"" and, of course, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of the greatest fantasy films ever made.

I'm not sure del Toro can recoup from this, but hopefully he'll have made enough money that he can chose his own projects. This material needs jokes about Cuban cigars, the ""f"" word, and Barry Manilow songs as much as the ""Ring Trilogy"" did. <br/><br/>Staggeringly dumb."
"zterrell","5","14","35","11 July 2008"," Sadly less charm than original.
","I paused to read many comments before I chose to go see Hellboy II for my birthday. I was skeptical from previews which showed endless fight scenes and a multitude of creatures. It seemed there were no humans in the previews and I feared there would be no connection for a human who was not a fanatic of the comic series. Sadly, my gut instinct was correct. An endless array of creatures -- each more awesome in destructive power than the last, and fight scenes which are as frequent as an old Kung Fu flick. I did enjoy Hellboy himself, but there was not enough time given to his love for Miss Firestarter...or any measure of maturity gained from their relationship. He needed his father to guide him, but (other than an early flashback)there was no father figure for him. As for the newest member, a tin-plated throw-back to Robby the Robot, with a terrible German accent, he was about as entertaining as Jar Jar Binks! In retrospect, it is a very visual show, but the characters as sadly lacking for depth and human empathy."

They I go again rambling on back to hellboy 2 if you like lots of special effects CGI rubber suits and the like you will probably love this film but if you want a plot as wheel then forget it this debacle descended into a farce in the first act where the first film was believable and well acted this one was totally unbelievable and really badly acted (did'nt anyone notice how bad it was)This is a huge disappointment for fans of the first film and it looks like there gonna make another one (straight to DVD perhaps)."
"imdbfan-11","3","6","12","27 July 2008"," mind-numbingly derivative and predictable
","This movie is a prime example of why I don't often see movies in the theater anymore. If I were at home I could have just turned it off, but if I've spent both time and money getting to the theater, I feel compelled to at least sit thru the movie in hopes that it'll get better. This one didn't.<br/><br/>The problem with sequels is that you've already introduced the characters in the original, so now you have to make them do something the audience cares about. Which generally means a good story. The plot here is OK, but its ""Broken truce from the past/battle fought here on Earth tonight/fate of mankind"" has been done ad nauseum, and better than this. Del Toro has done much better work, and I feel he's either out of his element in a big budget Hollywood movie, or that he has much less creative control in such situations.<br/><br/>This movie is a mishmash of hackneyed plot (she's pregnant), inane dialog ""You must stay fock-you-sed"" (see how funny words can sound when Germans pronounce them?), crummy sets (the Troll Market has nothing on Diagon Alley), and Abe Sapien doing his best ""C3PO in a fish suit"" impression.<br/><br/>The Forest Elemental is a particularly offensive segment. At its start, Prince Nuada opens the ""Golden EggCage of Power"" and pull out the Pulsing Green Jelly Belly. Princess Nuala, who presumably knows what this thing is, does nothing to stop it, does not even yell ""Get It!"", she just comments that ""It's heading for water"" as the characters inexplicably watch it bounce along and let it roll into water after a fairly lackluster attempt (after it's too late) by Abe to stop it. Perhaps the Jelly Belly has a standing 8 second Stupefy Curse upon release...<br/><br/>No, the real reason the characters do nothing to stop the Jelly Belly is because if they did then the movie makers wouldn't get to show us just how much money they spent on CGI. <br/><br/>On a side note, this bothered me throughout the movie. The possessed Tooth Fairy and the ""Sleeping Giant Rock ManDoor"" were just ""Hey Look at Me, I'm CGI!"" scenes that could have been much shorter because they added nothing to the progression of the story. Do I really care about a killer Tooth Fairy in its death throes?<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the Elemental. This is probably the biggest budget scene, but also the most emotionally muddled. After dispatching this humongous tentacled creature which predictably destroys cars, buildings, people etc.., the Prince leaves Hellboy a dilemma: can you kill the last creature of its kind? Well, since that creature tends to wantonly destroy everything, it's not too hard a dilemma. After Hellboy (too) easily kills the creature, and it starts dying, we are made to feel sorry for it. Wait up, 45 seconds ago it was killing people left and right, and now I'm supposed to feel sorry for it as it dies? I mean, it's only CGI. It bored me while it was destroying and now it's boring me while it's dying! Move on to the next scene already!<br/><br/>The ending was almost as bad. After descending into the Lair of the Hidden Golden Army, which looked suspiciously like the derelict spacecraft in Alien, Hellboy has it out with Prince Nadua in ""every 'Gladiator meets Martial Arts' fight you've ever seen"" manner. It would've been better if HB had managed to dispatch the Prince in a shorter and more clever way, because then we wouldn't've had to've sit through that mind-numbing segment, but I suspect the movie makers had enough trouble stretching the plot to get the movie past an hour.<br/><br/>At the very end, the 4 main characters inexplicably quit their jobs, and I suspect one whole scene and perhaps a subplot was cut, because this mass exodus comes out of nowhere. To further highlight their resignation, the German Krauss character says to Jeffrey Tambor after his pleas for their return, ""Suck my ectoplasmic schwanzstucker"", which about sums up the literacy level of the script. Over 15 need not apply!<br/><br/>The only positive thing about this cryptic ending is that now that all the main characters have quit their jobs, there may be no Hellboy 3."

","Last night I was lucky enough to get a free pass to see this and I enjoyed it so much, I'd pay to go see it again.<br/><br/>The best way to describe the genre of this film is it is like Lord of the Rings mixed in with Men In Black. And I'm sure I'll shock many of you when I say that is one of the best movies I've seen this summer. Director Guillermo del Toro does a wonderful job with his character creations, art direction and the fight scenes were some of the best I have ever seen. And if you like to laugh, there's plenty for you. At one point I was laughing so hard, I started to cough. If you have not seen first movie, you'll still be able to enjoy this movie. With the lag of good sequels lately, I have to say I enjoyed it more than the first one.<br/><br/>The only flaw I could find is some of the CGI effects on the larger creatures could uses a bit of a touch up, but, the effects were amazing to say the least. But probably that best part of the show is at the end when the credits start to roll, the whole audience began to sing along to Barry Manalow.

","There wasn't a whole lot I liked about this film. It just seemed like there would be some action, then filler, then action and so on. Not much of a story. What story there is centers about twins, a prince and princess. The prince is evil and is looking for 3 parts of a magical crown that when assembled gives the wearer command over the golden army, which is the most powerful supernatural army in the world.<br/><br/>Hellboy is still working for the government and still with Liz, whom is given a silly side plot of being pregnant. The princess runs off with the third crown piece and seeks help from Abe, Hellboy, and friends. The prince tries to get it back, finally does and then there is a short sequence of what the golden army can do and then finally the final fight scene between him and Hellboy.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is just mindless action, like with the giant plant, the huge monster at the troll market, etc... and it just gets to the point it is stale and bland. If they don't have a decent story, then sequels don't need to be made.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Gets tiring to sit through the same fighting over and over. I don't recommend it."

This one had nice sets, effects, and all--BUT-- the story was badly told. The dialog got on my nerves. I dunno. I'm thinking: superheroes (and heroes in general) SHOULD NEVER BE IN A RELATIONSHIP ---at least in movies because it leads to the most boring dialog and crap you don't care about. <br/><br/>And while we're at it, No sidekicks, either. Because they're always trying to be funny when they're not. If superheroes were made strictly for a male audience there would be no such thing cause guys just care about going after the bad guy, great effects, and ass-kicking. But these days they're made to have female appeal and so our hero is bogged down by all these emotions and domestic-like banter. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it they could make it work --if the dialog was snappy and clever --I wouldn't mind. In this movie Hellboy looks like a big dope and his girlfriend looks like a dope maker. I can't help but think that if she wasn't in the picture (as a love interest) he'd be more focused on what's important to me as a guy: looking cool and kicking ass. Love, Boloxxxi."

There were several songs in it that you could hum along to, and quite a few romantic and funny moments.<br/><br/>But when I say too edible, I mean TOO EDIBLE. I watched the first one when it came out, and then once more before we went to see the new one. I quite liked the first movie, and was really looking forward to see if they had used and expanded the potential that was put in the first movie. BUT NOOO. They had made a ""let's attract as wide an audience as possible""-movie. The main characters were less interesting than in the first one, there were a lot of unnecessary pop songs in the movie (kind of like in Spider-Man), and WAY too much of Toro's monsters in there. The movie had a very interesting view on elves, though. As in, they weren't just tall humans with pointy ears like in LOTR.<br/><br/>So, to sum it all up: if you're going with the expectation of seeing a movie with the same qualities as the first movie, only better, you'll be DISAPPOINTED.

","I like movies that combine a dark atmosphere, a sophisticated story and good action. Hellboy 2 defiantly has the action, the special effects and the visuals which makes the movie well worth watching. It has some comedy elements and good laughs as well. The story starts very promising but then goes on predictable and linear. The end is simply a joke and doesn't make any sense if you use some reasoning or logic on it. Don't try! A dark atmosphere or at least some tension does not exist in this movie. The characters Abe, Liz and Johann save the movie from being a flop with special effects. Hellboy acts in this movie like a childish clown with superpowers. That is not necessarily bad, but in the Hellboy animated films (for example) he is quite the opposite: cool, composed and grown up. Prince Nuada is an awesome character who won my sympathy from the minute he appeared on the screen. He is the kind of villain who is not simply evil: He has a point when he says that humans have destroyed nature for shopping malls. Nuada tries to win Hellboy for his mission. The dynamics between Hellboy and Nuada had much more potential: That would have been a chance to create a real ""hit"".<br/><br/>The movie is OK and worth watching but overrated by most people. I don't understand why every ordinary movie like Hulk 2 or this one gets an 8 point rating these days. It simply does not deserve it: 6 of 10 is enough."

Dark characters with a dark underlining clever story. It gave the whole experience depth, creating something worth watching again. If only del Toro had taken time to review his first Hellboy to remind himself what made the movie magical. He started out right with the original cast and characters minus one, so where did he go wrong???? To start out, the story was too far fetch with no original creativity. Where the first Hellboy story created it's own niche, the sequel seemed to look for a previous story to emulate. On the movie screen last night I saw reflections of the Star Wars bar scene, reflections of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the reliving of several bad love stories.<br/><br/>What happened to the Hellboy we were introduced to in the first film? Where was the great character and acting created in Abe Sapien by Doug Jones? If del Toro found it necessary to tell the movie story at the beginning, wouldn't you think that he should reconsider the entire story line as being weak to begin with.<br/><br/>Hellboy deserved a sequel, and many movie goers such as myself were looking forward to seeing this movie, but just from listening to the audience as we left the theater, the public is very disappointed. What a let down. I have to say, I wish this movie was never made allowing the fans of the first movie the memories of the first experience.<br/><br/>Sadly, even with such a great cast of actors, I hope we never have to endure another Hellboy on screen. del Toro, you made your money, now leave everyone alone, please."

I was astonishing by the way he treat the intimacy of our hero. Forgetting the impolite behavior and the natural violence in his character,Perlman give us a Hellboy with flaws, passion and clumsiness like no one other hero show us before. I like a lot, the Pan's Labyrinth touch Guillermo did to the fairies, chamberlain and the Angel of Death. I guess del Toro was inspired by the epic tale Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke by filming the battle with the Elemental. At the end of it, you will see how life grows of nowhere, just in the place the Elemental plasm drops. And again, where is the Abe Sapiens great voice?"

","To start, I LOVED HELLBOY! It's one of my favorite comic book movies (Ironman is my favorite) so I was really excited to see H2, but I left sort of confused. There were parts I loved and parts that just seemed like they belonged in a different movie. The plot is completely schizophrenic, one minute a drama, the next a comedy; one minute it's beautifully paying homage to ancient earth religions, the next it's slap stick and silly. And, the characters weren't exactly consistent either. In the first movie, Abe was an intellectual, brilliant but nerdy, sweet but not sappy. Supposedly the same actor played him in this movie but I couldn't even recognize him as the same character. Plus, there's a new character who is ridiculous, he's so unbelievable and useless as a plot device that if you took him out entirely, the movie wouldn't be any different.<br/><br/>Just to show you how bad this was (especially in comparison to the first one) and how disappointing, I figured out how the movie would end less than half way through. Hellboy was a little predictable but the characters made it worth it; this was just so formulaic it was sad.<br/><br/>I'm so disappointed, this could have been amazing but it wasn't."

However, Hellboy 2 was arguably the worst movie I have ever seen, topping even films like King Maker and Envy. The plot line was extremely choppy and basic and although special effects may have been decent, scenes depicting terribly painful bad acting including the long singing scene and the opening baby Hellboy scene made the movie a complete bust. It seemed as though the director was simply trying to overwhelm the audience with incredibleness and wow-factor rather than giving a simple good story.

","Prince Nuada is the last of a dying race and he has grown tired of watching his kind wither and die in a world that humans continue to tear apart. In order to gain back control and eliminate humans once and for all he will attempt to revive the ancient Golden Army, even if that means breaking the truce between humans and his father. As Hellboy attempts to prevent him from what would surely be the end of humanity as we know it he comes to the realization that he has much more in common with Prince Nuada than the humans he protects.<br/><br/>Hellboy 2 is a truly amazing piece of cinema. Guillermo Del Toro manages to not only make what may be the best comic book movie ever, but also make a fantasy story for the ages. On a visual and set design level, Hellboy 2 is absolutely stunning. The world he creates in Hellboy and the creatures that populate it are complete creative bliss.<br/><br/>The Troll Market scene is one of the happier moments I have ever had in sitting in a theater seat and it is packed to the brim with creatures that only Del Toro could think of, all the while not relying on CGI to get the job done. When every aspect of a movie is created using CGI it's hard to feel any connection to it (the Star Wars prequels anyone). I find prosthetics and makeup a much more impressive and effective method of bringing a character to life than CGI.<br/><br/>Aside from the visual splendor and eye popping action scenes, Hellboy 2 has a huge heart buried under its thrills. At the core there's Hellboy, brought to life by the underrated Ron Pearlman, who struggles with his place in a world that fears him. Then there's Liz Sherman, his damaged pyrotechnic girlfriend who may be more lost and confused than Hellboy himself. Their confused and tragic nature is what makes the characters in Hellboy 2 so great. They are super heroes who are freaks that would be cast out if they weren't useful in protecting the world from others like them.<br/><br/>Prince Nuada is one of the greatest villains in movie history; mainly because it would be easy to say that he wasn't a villain at all. His struggle to save his people is a true moral quandary that is very understandable given the circumstances. He believes that humans are the problem and he will stop them no matter what the cost. Is he right or is Hellboy, it's up to you to decide.<br/><br/>Another amazing addition from the original Hellboy is Johann Krauss; the new BPRD agent whose gaseous form is contained within a special suit. He is hilariously voiced by Seth McFarlane and the applications of his amazing powers are truly endless.<br/><br/>What I think brings down Hellboy 2's rating and consideration is that some of the humor is very silly and childish. Is that a big deal? You tell me. I agree that some scenes can be overly silly but that adds to the fun atmosphere and tone of the film.<br/><br/>Hellboy 2 is an absolute classic. It's filled with thrills to put you on the edge of your seat, it packs a much greater emotional punch than almost any movie of its type, and it has a ton of laughs as well. I can't smile without it."

","Well, I must say that this sequel is a step up from the first movie, which is mainly due to the fact that it's characters and action are all better and even its visuals are more impressive. However it also still has some of the same problems of the first movie.<br/><br/>Even though I always enjoyed watching ""Hellboy"" you also have to be fair and say that the movie is really not without its flaws. This is also the case with ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"". Sure, it's perfect simple entertainment and there is nothing wrong with that but its flaws prevent this movie from being a truly great and memorable movie from Guillermo del Toro.<br/><br/>Even though its an highly imaginative movie, it isn't a very original one to watch. Its story is pretty simple and really not that original. The only think that really still makes the movie great and original to watch are its characters and imaginative visuals from Guillermo del Toro, which has really become his trademark- and distinctive style. This is also the reason why people always praise his movies so highly but when you look deeper into this movie, you'll just have to say that it's not really a that great one.<br/><br/>Basically when you analyze the movie and its story, the movie is nothing more than the one action sequence after the other. Sure, there is very little wrong with the action but it often happens to quickly after the other previous action sequences and also ends too abruptly, causing some potential good and interesting characters to disappear out of the movie too quickly. Still the movie is given some more depth this time with its story, which means that the main characters themselves are more interesting this time. This especially goes for the Selma Blair and Jeffrey Tambor character.<br/><br/>Just like the first movie, this movie has a pretty awesome main villain but he also gets underused a bit. His motivations are too simple and not developed well enough into actions. Lets hope that in a possible sequel they also start to concentrate a bit more on its main villain, rather than just on its main heroes and putting in many more different new characters. It will give the movie some more substance.<br/><br/>Of course I still really enjoyed watching this movie but once you start to take away the movie its visual, very little will be left over from it and ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" would had been a very simple and below average modern superhero movie. Thank God for Guillermo del Toro and his attempt- and passion for the franchise to still make the movie a visually great and entertaining one to watch. Also thank God for Ron Perlman, who simply is Hellboy and gives the character and movie so much extra.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Though primed to dislike this movie by the critics, I admired every second of it. Somehow there's something real about the regular world vs other world theme. This is truly an achievement that many would give their eye tooth to match. This is no familiar drama, it's a wildly imagined and beautifully executed tour de force. These artists so thoroughly overwhelm any vision you might have from the comic book that there's no contest.<br/><br/>Perlman, not exactly the most likable of actors, is perfect down to every move he makes. You will leave wanting more, much more. And Selma Blair, always engaging, doesn't let the magic falter for a moment. Some of the fight scenes are as good, if not better, than anything I've ever seen in a regular Kung Fu extravaganza, and my only regret is that I didn't see this in the theaters, but on DVD. I blame the critics! A pox on their house!<br/><br/>This ensemble reached for something different. I've seen it attempted dozens of times but I've never seen it achieved so convincingly. I'm putting Guillermo del Toro up there with Ridley Scott and James Cameron, but, frankly, I loved everyone's performance. What a delight!"

","The previews for Hellboy 2 looked incredible. Too bad the movie was beyond brutal. First off, give credit where credit is due: The effects were amazing as was the cinematography and of course the overall conception of the movie. Lots of cool characters and worlds. Visually stunning. BUT great effects etc. does not a movie make. The story could not have been more boring. An endless array of pointless dialog trying desperately to advance the story. They should have focused on making sure the action/fight scenes were a cut above, not average. It was a shame to watch these terrible action sequences take place amidst such breathtaking sets. It was like half the crew showed up and the other half just kinda coasted through the production. The acting was OK but why wasn't Hellboy himself more entertaining. he's supposed to be this loudmouth, smart ass, tough talking, take no s**t tough guy. Instead he was just kinda normal with no real edge. Not Pearlman's fault as the dialog was awful. It looks like Del Torro was too concerned with the visual aspects of the film (which he plays a massive part in) and forgot that he was also responsible for actually DIRECTING the film. As a result, the film severely lacks focus and trips over itself constantly. I know tons of people love Del Torro and this franchise but Hellboy 2 is a poor movie. It is however a stunning visual experience. Maybe if Del Torro decides to hand off the directing reigns and stick to what he clearly enjoys more (conceptualizing the movie) then if there's a third installment, the results might be different."

The second movie, unlike the first, has a much wider mixture of fairytale creatures and fairytale stories, which in my opinion adds to its appeal. It kind of reminded me of lord of the rings a little bit, but that's OK. the first thing i really liked were the visual effects. they're really good and mean a lot for the movie, they keep the atmosphere up-beat. also, i liked the fact that there are a lot of scenes when you get disconnected from the main plot and just enjoy a little bit of a laugh (and some scenes are really funny). this is a really nice follow-up and i dare say i enjoyed more than the first movie."

","Having enjoyed the first Hellboy movie, I made time to visit the cinema the other day to watch the sequel Hellboy II: The Golden Army. I often don't get time to visit the cinema and this can be really infuriating if I end up watching a less than great movie, but this certainly wasn't the case with Hellboy II! Once again, the directing and writing was overseen by Guillermo del Toro and, once again, he didn't disappoint. In fact, after Blade II, Pan's Labyrinth and now the Hellboy movies, I'm fast becoming an admirer of his.<br/><br/>The plot for Hellboy II is this: The mythical world that Hellboy was rejected from as a young child starts a rebellion against humanity in order to rule the Earth. An elf prince (played by former Bros singer Luke Goss) leads the assault and seeks control of the ancient mechanised Golden Army to virtually guarantee him victory. Hellboy and his team are assigned with stopping him.<br/><br/>I'll start by mentioning the many creatures in this movie. Guillermo del Toro knows how to do great, fantastical and scary looking creatures. If he ever does a Star Wars type movie (which I sincerely hope he does) my money is on it surpassing anything George Lucas has offered us. The creatures are nothing short of incredible. Several times during the movie, I thought I was watching the likes of Star Wars, Labyrinth and Total Recall all rolled into one.<br/><br/>Actually, the whole movie feels like the end result of Die Hard making love to The Dark Crystal. At one point, Hellboy takes on a huge forest elemental in the middle of a busy street while simultaneously trying to protect a baby and the whole experience is just brilliant. Also, early on in the movie, Hellboy and his team get attacked by tooth fairies. I bet any kid who lays eyes on them and what they're capable of will refuse to leave teeth under their pillow from then on. Even the elves go against more traditional imagery, their normally fair skin instead showing imperfections and unusual scars.<br/><br/>So, given that this isn't Shakespeare or some ""lah-de-dah"" period drama, the pace of the story and the standard of acting is top notch. I have to mention Luke Goss again. He surprised me as Nomak in Blade II and again he surprised me with another impressive performance as the elf prince. Forget a Bros reunion, Luke, you're best off sticking with your current profession!<br/><br/>Finally, there's the comedy, perfectly mixed in with the more serious aspects of the plot and the action scenes. There are several very funny moments but two really stood out for me; Hellboy and team mate Abe Sapien getting drunk together while discussing their love lives. A jolly old sing-along ensues and Barry Manilow's ""Can't smile without you"" gets murdered (if that's at all possible). Also, new character Johan Krauss is stereotypically German (or, at least, from near there) and this adds so much to his hilarious argument/punch-up with Hellboy.<br/><br/>In conclusion then, I'll keep it short and sweet: watch this movie!"

Right from the beginning, I watched and thought ""Why?"" Why do people act like they are retards, why are they doing things, normal people wouldn't do? I predicted always right whats gonna happen next. You can make a good movie based on a comic, for instance Sin City and Constantine were great, but this is just a waste of time.

","Hellboy is back and better than ever. I got very excited after I heard a sequel was coming out. What got me even more pump was when the teaser trailer came out. I was literally counting the days until I saw the movie. When I saw it, I couldn't stop talking about it. The film was beautifully directed and Guillermo Del Toro did an amazing job.<br/><br/>In the original, Hellboy (Ron Perlman) was up against some pretty ugly monsters. In The Golden Army, Hellboy is up against an unstoppable army of creatures, the golden army, and a Prince name Nuada (Luke Goss). There is more to the story than this, but this the farthest I will go. I hate spoiling things.<br/><br/>The storyline of The Golden Army is much bigger and better than the original. What makes the story so amazing is that it takes you to different awesome environments. Along with that, the creatures that Del Toro created were absolutely incredible. That's why I love Del Toro, his creativity and vision of things.<br/><br/>After seeing the first Hellboy, I thought Ron Perlman was the perfect actor. He totally knows the Hellboy character. Selma Blair was also great as Liz Sherman. This time though, she is more involved with the team and Hellboy too. This time around, Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) gets more screen time and is also more involved with the team. Luke Goss was pretty good as Prince Nuada. I really liked the way they did the make-up. His sister, Princess Nuala, is portrayed by Anna Walton, who gave a really good performance too.<br/><br/>The action and special effects in The Golden Army are much better than its predecessor. The fighting scenes were amazing, especially the one with the golden army. What makes the action so good is the humor with it. It makes it more enjoyable and interesting. The effects were pretty damn amazing. They look very realistic and are one of the best I've seen this year.<br/><br/>Hellboy 2: The Golden Army is one of the best summer flicks of 08 and it is a lot of fun. Guillermo Del Toro made another great film and I can't wait when he returns to do Hellboy 3."

","If you have not viewed the first Hellboy, all the better for you, when you do see, Hellboy II. Through a 'flashback' scene, at the beginning of this sequel, the audience is introduced to the now dead, Professor Trever ""Broom"" Brutenholm. ( John Hurt) The setting is right out of an old, 'Father Knows Best,' early 1950's television sitcom. The silver screen brings forth, Director Guilleino del Toro's, ""Professor and Hellbrat!"" A vision, of father and Hellpest, at home, where too much time is not left, on the cutting-room floor. Wait for the Director's Editon, when it comes out on DVD. Hellboy is supposed to be a larger than life character, but in Hellboy II, he is not. This is made painfully aware, to the audience, when our hero is standing next to his team mates. In the original Hellboy, 'Red' (Ron Perlman) is presented as a much, larger-than-life creature from the underworld! Where do you think, the name of the film, came from, for the screenplay! Hellboy's love interest is the very hot, in fact on fire, Liz Sherman(Selma Blair). Unfortunately there is not an ounce, of this once, very heated, relationship in this sequel. No passion, and the plot suffers! There is however, Abe Sapien, (Doug Jones) whose comic relief, as an aqua-breathing, Lothario, saves the film, from death by deadpan acting, and lack of any emotion at all. Even Tom Manning (Jeffery Tambor) as the acting, bumbling, chief, of the organization, whose job is 'to bump back at things, which go bump in the night', offers little in the way of humor. Where Hellboy II does shine, is the attention, which Mr. del Toro, spent on the creatures, 'who do go bump in the night'. The interaction of 'Red' and his crew in the action sequences, are quite good, but not enough to equal Hellboy I. Now some may say, that this production, is made to show 'Red's' more human side, if so, then Hellboy II, most certainly, stumbles, over his own feet, of red clay."
"LtdEdLoser","1","6","14","17 July 2008"," Oh What in the World.
","I was completely shocked that, after reading all these great reviews on this movie, it ended up being complete trash. Everything from the story to Selma Blair's acting was absolutely atrocious. Everything any of the characters do in the movie seem to be just on a whim. There was no depth to any of the characters and really no explanation as to why they are doing the things they are doing. We are given no real insight as to who anyone is. Yet we are expected to care enough about them to like the movie. The relationship between Abe and Nuala along with the mild hostility between Hellboy and Liz are equally absurd. You top this on with a collective bad acting and even worse directing and you have something pretty close to the definition of garbage. I would go into great detail and pick out specific scenes but I don't want to ruin any surprises for the poor soul who still goes to see this movie. This has been one of the most awful movies I have ever seen. And I have seen some awful movies.<br/><br/>It's an F buddy"
"Quinoa1984","10","6","14","11 July 2008"," a reminder of the joy in fantasy movies as much as good-old comic-book fun
","I don't know what goes on in director Guillermo del-Toro's head, but whatever it is it'd be a sad day when it stops churning away. He's a fantasist in the purest and most enjoyable tradition, where he's so passionate and in love with these characters in worlds like Hellboy and his masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth that one has to believe in his belief of this world, and not in any naive sensibility either. In his imagination, as let loose onto film with the vibrancy of legend and the truth of a docu-drama (as with Hellboy creator Mike Mignola), it's more about the power of myth than just simple mindless comic-book blockbuster fun.<br/><br/>And in the case of the Hellboy 2, he's got more creative control than in the first film, and a handle on the reins of the various technical and special effects and make-up and creature and etc etc departments that has been mastered further following Pan's Labyrith. It's hard for me to figure on it being any less than the predecessor; on the contrary he's made it with a level of ridiculous impact in the regular action-movie sensibility, and with touches of romance and humor that are staggeringly good and entertaining. And as an extra kicker, it's highly recommendable for those who had such a LACK of interest that they didn't even bother with the first Hellboy or the comics. It's that damn good.<br/><br/>But with all of the advancements that del-Toro has vs. four or five years ago, and all of the added creatures and creations from the 'German' Johann Krauss, to the Troll city, to those delightfully vicious 'tooth-fairies', to the one mystical being in the Ireland rock that looks resembles a cousin-relation to the 'Pan' universe, the ""forest"" monster who's demise springs a surprisingly wonderful result, and the immense Golden army itself and how all of this is combines with a genius level of 'old-fashioned' special effects and CGI, the story comes first. And in this there's just a little more at stake, a little more for Hellboy (and Abe Sapien too) to worry about and protect, and of course all of that the-world-is-in-danger stuff comes with the package. There's even a touching, cruel twist with the main villain, an evil Prince who wants control over the 70x70-large Golden army, being connected by mind and body and spirit to the Princess, who is kinder and wiser and becomes a love interest to a character.<br/><br/>While it may not be too much of a spoiler to say whom, I won't for the sake of the present review. Suffice to say that romantic entanglement isn't nearly as engrossing as the one continuing and growing between Hellboy (the always bad-ass Ron Perelman) and Liz (sexy and actually good actress Selma Blair). All of the strands, however, work pretty much all in sync with the high-voltage of emotions working in and around the main narrative, which isn't too complex in truth.<br/><br/>Bottom line, it's a fun time at the movies, with the laughs many and often big (a line about a certain 'baby' brought down the house at my screening), and relying on the great personalities on the actors and characters, and featuring some real slam-banging action of the summer AND of the year. This filmmaker knows what he's doing, and it's thrilling to see him work his, for lack of a better word, magic."

How nice, too, to have such a wonderful ensemble of characters -- Hellboy himself is one helluva scene-stopper, but he in no way overpowers any of the others. They feed on each other -- and every single one of them is fully formed and three dimensional -- even the dimensionless gaseous ectoplasm. The movieworld universe has been immeasurably enriched! Hellboy originally was visually stunning, but Del Toro really has surpassed himself. He's even managed to surpass his own work in Pan's Labyrinth. Amazing. Simply Amazing."
"Pillory","10","2","3","25 August 2017"," Even Better Than the First
","Although the first film was great, Hellboy II: The Golden Army blows it out of the water. Visually, the movie is spectacular; Guillermo really captures breathtaking fantasy (reminiscent of Pan's Labyrinth) but makes it more gritty as to suit the Hellboy universe. The movie used a lot of constructed props and puppetry, as opposed to pure CGI, and it worked wonderfully. The film had so many settings that were amazing to watch and had so much intrigue to them.<br/><br/>The story, although arguably not the strongest part of any superhero movie, held my attention and made sense. Although the film's plot and even its antagonist were never mentioned in any of the comics, that didn't stop the story from being interesting. The film also transitioned very nicely from the first one and I'd recommend watching that one before you watch this one. <br/><br/>The action scenes were another strong part of this film. Although Hellboy himself may not have the coolest powers or fighting abilities, watching him fight against Luke Goss's character was a real treat. They really stepped up these action sequences from the first movie!<br/><br/>Ron Perlman's portrayal of Hellboy is perfect; there was really no one else who would've suited the role better. Doug Jones also brought a lightness to Abe Sapien's character that wasn't really shown in the comics but was greatly appreciated. I loved the chemistry between Hellboy, Liz, and Abe in the film. The rest of the main cast also were good in their parts--they were very well cast.<br/><br/>Over all, I'd definitely recommend this film to any superhero fans and especially fans of the Hellboy/BPRD comics. Although the story and the characters may not be completely true to the comics, I didn't mind the changes at all. The movie took me on an emotional train ride: there are parts where I laughed out loud and parts that were definitely touching. Although I'm biased, being a huge fan of the comic books growing up, these two movie installments of Hellboy will always be my favourite superhero movies and I hope you enjoy the movies as much as I did."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8","2","3","2 August 2015"," An enjoyable followup
","For Ron Perlman, an actor with more than 200 credits to his filmography, there is only one series he has clearly stated again and again that he cares about most. That role belongs to the character of Hellboy. Although the iconic character was not made by him, Perlman himself made the character his own. That and with the help of several other crewmembers, Hellboy (2004) was a hit among moviegoers. After that in between that time and the sequel, two animated films were produced. Both of which ran along the same lines in entertainment. They weren't high- grade animation but still managed to pull off being brainless fun like they were extended TV show episodes. As to where it was aimed for demographically, it seemed as if the producers weren't sure. However with the official sequel, the better qualities return and prove that the franchise of Hellboy should stick with the live-action versions over animated until the producers can figure out whom it's meant for.<br/><br/>Directed again by creature designer Guillermo del Toro, this sequel has lots to offer. Initially starting out before the events of Hellboy (2004), fans see a young Hellboy being told a bedtime story by Professor Broom (John Hurt - more as a cameo) that gives us the premise of the film. A long time ago, humans made a treaty with another humanoid race in order to keep peace. However, a prince known as Prince Nuada (Luke Gross) seeks to take over the planet with a crown that controls an ancient Golden Army. In order to command this force, he needs to have the three pieces of the crown put back together. Everything from down to its characterizations and development to the acting is top notch. Ron Perlman as Hellboy will always be the right choice. His wisecracks and personality are the same as before. Selma Blair as Liz Sherman hasn't changed either. The role of Liz changes for the better as well, which helps Hellboy develop in return.<br/><br/>Doug Jones as Abe Sapien maintains his character personality as well and develops more in depth feelings too. Also like the animated films, Abe was also voiced by Jones and not David Hyde Pierce. It is strange though that in the animated films Jones didn't sound as good as Pierce, yet in this film Jones sounds more identical to Pierce's voice. No matter the voice, Jones still is Abe. Jeffrey Tambor as nonstop complaining Tom Manning returns but has a more limited role with the introduction of a new supporting character Johann Krauss voiced by comedic talent Seth MacFarlane. The character of Johann Krauss is an ectoplasmic being who contains himself inside an airtight mechanical suit and has special abilities that make him quite useful in problem solving and battling. He too also has a character arc. Also once the viewer knows Krauss' voice belongs to MacFarlane, it'll be difficult to imagine anyone else voicing him. Luke Gross as Prince Nuada and his sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) are interesting to watch as well. Luke Gross plays a memorable villain and Anna Walton's role is important too in plot and character development.<br/><br/>The only flaw in the writing that doesn't make sense is some of its continuity and it accounts for a very small amount. A lot of the continuity is on point, for example there's a brief explanation to what happened to Agent John Myers (Rupert Evans) from Hellboy (2004). As to why other sequels can't throw in small explanations like these to missing characters is beyond me. This kind of solution is the simplest of things to fix and several sequels to other franchises don't do this. However, the one piece of continuity that doesn't make sense is Abe Sapien's ability to be out of his water tank without his breathing apparatus. At first, it seemed like that was his only way of being out of his tank (like a fish). Then, somewhere at the quarter mark Abe no longer wears it. Okay,...so did he really need it to begin with? If not, it was kind of like excess weight for no reason. This however is the movie's smallest issue. The action is given a helpful boost in energy and creativeness. There's sword/fist fights that are fast paced, deadly and are fun to watch.<br/><br/>Plus with this being a Guillermo del Toro fantasy film, the special effects and creature designs look great. The Golden Army are intriguing to see in their mechanical forms along with other creatures like the Angel of Death, Wink and the Tooth Fairy (not what you think it is). The cinematography carried out by long time del Toro collaborator Guillermo Navarro looks great as well. There aren't many wide spanning landscape shots but for what there is, it looks beautiful. For one thing, the camera is always steadily moving to try and give the viewers a better idea of theirs' and the characters' surroundings. As for music, the score changed from composers from Marco Beltrami to Danny Elfman. Unfortunately with this transition, the main theme for Hellboy itself was lost. As to why Elfman couldn't recycle the theme I don't know. However, it wasn't a total loss. For one, Elfman creates themes for the Golden Army itself and for the love themes between characters. For the love themes, they are actually reminiscent to that of Elfman's early work dealing with this set of emotions. It's beautiful and euphoric.<br/><br/>Aside from one very minor continuity error, everything else to this sequel is crafted expertly. The old and new characters continue to develop, along with fun action sequences, polished special effects, great looking camera-work and music that has memorable themes."

","Hellboy II: The Golden Army will please fans of the first by continuing its nice visuals, colorful characters, and decent action sequences. Otherwise, the film doesn't break much new ground and hurts itself with somewhat unorganized plot lines.<br/><br/>In HB II, the Prince of a hidden race of elves seeks a magical crown that will enable him to command an army of mechanical soldiers with which to conquer mankind. Hellboy, with his pals Abe and Liz and newcomer Johann Krauss, must aid the elf Princess to thwart his dastardly plan.<br/><br/>This is a decent core plot for an action movie, but I could do without the multitude of subplots that clutter the film between shots. Thematically, this movie is all over the place. Here is a sampling of the themes that HB II touches upon: authority and discipline, love and family, personal sacrifice, prejudice and racism, environmentalism and conservationism. Yikes! That's a lot for one movie, let alone an action movie. Some of those are touched upon for literally one or two minutes and then never mentioned or resolved again. HB II almost feels like one issue of a series to be continued later-- which is perfectly understandable considering the source material, but a movie really should be edited to be free standing.<br/><br/>Also, many scenes in HB II very distinctly feel like other movies. At times, you will feel like you are watching a chapter from: Men in Black, X-men, Spiderman, Lord of the Rings, most of Jet Li's movies.<br/><br/>Speaking of Jet Li, HB II continues the slightly annoying trend of making random characters and creatures into kung-fu martial artists, like the shaolin vampires in the Blade series. Sure, del Toro's version of ""elves"" is entitled to his own interpretation, but it still feels slapped on and pandering, sort of like how so many movies try to captivate their western audiences with a generous helping of ninjas.<br/><br/>HB II's great strength is in its nicely styled visuals. If you are a fan of del Toro's works or other films with a mythical yet modern look (ie The 5th Element), then you should enjoy the settings and creatures del Toro presents in HB II.<br/><br/>All in all, I give Hellboy II a 6. It could have used some editing, but it's definitely worth watching."

","If you haven't watched the movie, you may be wondering what my summary means. It's in reference to the environmentally friendly message(mind you, I am with them on that) of the film, as well as the fact that the plot contains quite a lot of ideas that del Toro has used in his earlier work, namely Blade II and, yup, the movie that this is the sequel to. Overall, the story's fine, it just seems like the main conflicts in this could be resolved far sooner than they are, and there's no explanation in the flick for why they aren't, which is obviously a let-down. There are several holes, and so many occurrences appear to be of no consequence, or aren't taken seriously in the picture. The silliness level is kicked up a notch, and frankly, this does try too hard at being funny, at points. A lot of it does work, and this does garner some deserved laughs. A couple of characters come off as thin, one-note jokes. Blair portrays Liz as being stronger than last time we saw her, without losing the essence of her role, and in general does quite good in this. Perlman nails his part, again; I'm not certain he could screw it up, really. Hyde Pierce no longer provides the voice for Abe, but Jones, who also provides the demanding physical portion, and did in the first as well, does nicely. One of the new additions is Seth MacFarlane, who is great, though he sounds rather close to Klaus, off his show American Dad(...in spite of the fact that he apparently doesn't do that voice... huh). Another is Luke Goss, who, I guess, just really digs getting made up as an Albino and playing... well, I shouldn't say, I'd be revealing spoilers, and I don't intend to do so here. This is definitely more in the genre of fantasy than the original, and it seems that they indulged in the visually stimulating, and less dramatically interesting, aspect of it, namely, there are a *ton* of imaginative, creatively designed beings in this, without any of them particularly being used, even subtly, as metaphors, for situations, types of people or anything else that we can relate to. The effects are excellent, no doubt about that. However, if you aren't into the spectacle, you will find that somewhat unsatisfying. The action is stylized and awesome, clearly Animé-inspired, as Guillermo likes it. He also puts as the most gears he possibly could fit into two hours. The pace is fast. There is infrequent and usually mild or moderate language, disturbing content, and violence and gore that is apparently OK for 13-year-olds to see. The DVD comes with a subbed, informative and entertaining director's commentary track, notes he made, often with video clips, and a bunch of featurettes. I recommend this to fans of those involved with making it, the comic books and especially the supernatural. 7/10"

Hellboy was a movie I thought I would never like, yet thoroughly enjoyed. I think I like part II even better. I love the characters in Hellboy II, especially Prince Nuada and Princess Nuala. Nuada is the bad guy but a very sympathetic bad guy. He's a revolutionary who wants to free the people of the underworld from an unjust truce with the humans. He kills his wise, old father but remains a sympathetic character because he is fighting for a cause. Princess Nuala is very enchanting, especially for Blue, the fish-guy.

","Having loved the original Hellboy I was fervently looking forward to this sequel and while Hellboy II The Golden Army isn't a disappointment neither is it up to the standard of the first film. Having said that anything that lets director Guillermo Del Toro propagate his extraordinary imagination is well worth seeing for that reason alone and this film displays that to superlatively sumptuous effect.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman reprises the role of the wisecracking Hellboy who we see as a boy in the opening sequence being told the story of the golden Army by his human father ( John Hurt) who once fought against human kind( the golden army that is , not his father ) but have been mothballed by dividing the crown that controls them into three separate pieces kept in secret locations. Elf prince Nuada ( Luke Goss) may look a little on the pasty side but he is a great warrior and is determined to awaken the golden army so he can wage war on human kind. His twin sister Nuala (Ann Walton) is rather more moderate realising the chaos this would unleash .She also holds one of those missing pieces.<br/><br/>This is pretty standard fantasy fare and there is an argument that Del Toro and Hellboy creator Mike Mingola , the writers should have come up with something stronger in terms of the story , though the script does have a certain sardonic frisson and there is some tremendous character interplay.<br/><br/>Hellboy is still working for the secretive Bureau For Paranormal Research And Defence and still annoying his overbearing boss Manning (Jeffrey Tambor ) who laments his lack of discipline and the fact he keeps getting photographed and put on ""You Tube"" .""I hate You Tube"" he tells Abe Sapian ( Doug Jones) the polite blue skinned amphibian . Hellboy,s partner the fiery (literally ) Liz (Selma Blair) is finding ""Reds"" lack of domesticity a problem and there is another potential dilemma lurking . Agent John Myers from the first film has been dispatched to Antarctica we are told ( this is because Rupert Evans who played him in Hellboy was unavoidable due to stage commitments)""He likes the cold"" Hellboy sneers, and is replaced by ectoplasmic agent Johann Krauss ( voiced by ""Family Guys "" Seth McFarlane with an amusing mangled German accent which he based on Jeremy Irons character in Die Hard 3) whose officiousness rubs up Hellboy the wrong way.<br/><br/>The film makes points about selfless sacrifice , the power of love, the magnetic need for normality (Which it shares with Batman ) and hints broadly at a potential conflict of interest for Hellboy to resolve if there is another Hellboy film . The performances are great again and it,s nice that Liz is given a more developed role other than looking mopey. Really though it's the visuals and set pieces that astound with this film .Del Toro has an incredible eye and will make a scene fantastical even when something ordinary would do. The ""Troll Market"" scene is astonishing and the high-speed acrobatic denouement between Hellboy and Nuada in a cavernous city surrounded by enormous golden mechanical beings and massive rotating cogs is just breathtaking . There is no cheap CGI for Del Toro , everything looks authentic and he even invokes the demise of a giant ""elemental"" creature with a sense of magic and loss.<br/><br/>Del Toro clearly feels close to the Hellboy character .He turned down the chance to direct ""Halo "" , Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince"" and ""I An Legend"" to bring this sequel to the screen . It wouldn't be the same without his marvellous vision yet if there is to be another Hellboy ( I very much hope there is) film he needs to work more on the story . Can you imagine a Hellboy film with the same allegorical and dramatic punch as his masterpiece Pans Labyrinth ? Till then this will do nicely though."
"tburke85","8","2","3","7 June 2009"," Hellboy 2 A Step Up From The First One
","Hellboy 2 is a step up from the first one but with some flaws. Director Guillermo del Toro returns and gives us a worthy follow up to the original film. He continues to prove his talent and wild imagination with some of the new various creatures that are in this one. Most of them may only get blink or you missed it cameos while others get a little more screen time but they all look great and at least somewhat realistic. The cast minus Rupert Evans as John Myers from the first one are back and they're still solid in their roles especially Ron Perlman as Hellboy. Ron Perlman continues to be the perfect choice for the role portraying him as a demon with a conscience who does care about other people but even his character in this one seems to get less screen time than he did in the previous film. Which isn't really a bad thing but Perlman should have had a little more screen time. Selma Blair, Jeffrey Tambor, and Doug Jones reprise their roles from the first one turning in good performances. Luke Goss joins the cast as the villain a highly skilled elf Prince named Nuada. Goss does a decent job with the part he does play in the movie. He makes for an effective adversary and a challenge to Hellboy. Well done. John Hurt even shows up for a cameo appearance and does the best he can with the brief role in the movie. There's more action in this one which is impressive but nothing we haven't really seen before. The special effects are great and the new creatures shown in this one maybe very brief but they all work well with the imaginary world these characters inhabit in the film. Overall despite some flaws with the pacing and CGI Hellboy 2 is better than the first one. It has just the right amount of action, some suspense, humor, a little romance, and impressive performances from the cast especially Perlman who may get a little less screen time than in the original but he still makes it an entertaining comic book movie to watch."
"Samiam3","7","2","3","20 March 2009"," Hellboy oh boy
","A significant step up from the first; the wit, action, emotional elements, and creativity make Hellboy II superior to the mighty 'Dark Knight' (king of the 2008 summer blockbusters.) in some ways, and the film never takes itself too seriously, which means that the stupidity is acceptable. <br/><br/>Prince Nuada wants to break an ancient truce that his race made with humanity long ago, and release an army of mechanical golden warriors that was built for his king father, but it lay dormant once the truce was made. Nuada seeks to recover the royal crown needed to command the army and destroy humanity. This is where Hellboy and his team come in. The rest of the story sort of falls into play from there.<br/><br/>Hellboy II is a very competent superhero story, until the climactic twenty minutes come about. At this point, Hellboy and his friends have found the location of the golden army which has been awoken by Nuada and is ready to crush the world. Five minutes later, all the soldiers are asleep again because of a very silly turn of events that will leave the audience rather disappointed. The ending is a short cliffhanger, and due to the sufficient success of the movie, another sequel is likely to be made.<br/><br/>Even if you didn't like the original 'Hellboy', you will probably enjoy this one."
"basrutten","7","2","3","24 February 2009"," Mixed feelings
","OK, I admit, I never cared much for the first Hellboy much, but after the great job Del Toro did with Pan's Labyrinth, I was rather eager to see this movie. Now that I've seen it, I am left with mixed feelings.<br/><br/>To start with the good things: this is a lot more like Pan's Labyrinth than it is like the first Hellboy movie. In fact, this is more a fantasy movie set in modern times than it is a superhero movie. It's full of wonderfully imaginative scenery, wonderfully creative creatures..it's just full of wonder.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the positive qualities of this movie stay almost entirely on the visual side.<br/><br/>Whereas Pan's Laybrinth did have a compelling story and characters you cared about, these aspects are sadly underdeveloped in Hellboy 2...the narrative is the same bare-bones stuff as in the first movie, the characters are interesting by themselves but not much is done with them (there are some hints at Hellboy falling to the Dark Side, so to speak, but they remain just hints), and also like in the first movie there is an overall lack of suspense since, well, the heroes get through every fight way too easy and never feel in any kind of real danger.<br/><br/>What I also found annoying was the overall tone of the movie...it goes from total silliness to deadly serious over and over again..one moment you're watching slapstick, the next moment you're stuck in an overly dramatic death or love scene. Of course there can be jokes in a seriously or epic movie too (see LOTR), but this much inconsistency hurts.<br/><br/>That being said, I do have to give the movie some credit. The action sequences are mostly nicely done (don't expect any epic battles though, in spite of the fact that there is 'Army' in the title; the army doesn't get to do much), the Krauss character is a very nice addition, and most of the jokes are mildly amusing.<br/><br/>In the end I did enjoy Hellboy 2. It's plagued by the flaws that the first movie also had, and it's got serious consistency and tone problems, but the stunning visuals and obvious creativity make up for a lot."
"emdoub","5","2","3","22 January 2009"," What was a temple is now an amusement park....
","Del Toro does a fine job of creating creepy monsters from which the world needs saving, but here, he takes a strong step back from the fun of the first movie. Primarily, the storyline is a parody of itself, with many parts of the plot so absurd as to make it difficult to lose oneself in this movie.<br/><br/>There are, as other reviewers have noted, lots of bits of homage to other movies in the genre (if not outright theft from them) - enough to make spotting them a game, distracting from the movie itself. The characters aren't given nearly as much development as they had in the first movie - in fact, they become parodies of themselves. For example, the Hellboy who had promised to be unobtrusive, is giving interviews to a television news crew 5 minutes later.<br/><br/>But story is where this really falls flat. Serious spoilers follow.<br/><br/>Okay - the Elvish prince, to save their world from an excess of shopping centers, kills his beloved father, the king - just as if nobody else in the kingdom would care. Liz, whose powers are the only effective counter to the (delightfully creepy) tooth faeries, declines to unleash said powers until everyone else in the building has been slaughtered, other than central characters - and then causes an explosion strong enough to toss Hellboy through the wall. Everyone else, of course, survives the blast with no problems. Abe Sapien needs the gill suit, but only outside of the BPRD headquarters - inside, he wanders around without it, without trouble. Abe and Hellboy, drinking to console themselves over the inscrutability of women and love, devolve into singing along with one of Barry Manilow's sappiest songs. The Elvish princess, after quietly watching her brother take undisputed control of the Golden Army, and suffer defeat at Hellboy's hands, suicides to prevent him from attacking Hellboy again. Krauss, who apparently is ectoplasm in a very Del Toro-esquire robot, can use that ectoplasm to swing a locker door hard enough to emboss Hellboy's face in it, but cannot use it to pull a spear point out.<br/><br/>Parody can be fun, but bringing Hellboy II to such levels of parody is an insult to the franchise, and the audience that loved the first installment. If you don't have a story worth telling, don't make the movie."
"gring0","6","2","3","29 November 2008"," Sound and Fury...
","Watching this film was a chore- it seemed forced, cliché-ridden and redundant. The dialogue is unimaginative and the humour strictly paint-by-numbers. The plot is ridiculous to the point where I couldn't care less. The visuals were over-the-top in an attempt to cover up the lack of depth and subtlety and over-reliance on established themes and stereotypes. I accept that for those few who are familiar with the comics it may get a kick out of it, but for me it simply rehashes all the other such films, most noticeably Lord of the Rings with the Elves holding the three pieces of the sacred crown and the original Star Wars. The special effects didn't impress me either; consider the opening strained scene where the mayhem ignored in the background is clearly projected into the background in a slightly more advanced way than King Kong (1933). The plot meandered and the characters' interaction with the environment defied logic. www.lairdkeir.spaces.live.com"

","What happens when you combine Independence Day, Men in Black, I, Robot, Unconditional Love, Lord of the Rings, Galaxy Quest, Total Recall, and for good measure toss in some Barry Manilow? You get Hellboy II. What happened? What made the first movie much better was the sardonic wit of the main character and a story that kept on track. And though Perlman does deliver some wry comments, most of them really do not work. We start the movie out with a back story of how Hellboy was discovered then fast forward to when he is around 11, waiting for Santa Claus to come down the wood stove and wants a story from Father before he brushes his teeth and goes to bed. Father then tells the tale of the Golden Army. Fast forward again and we have The Bad Guy, out of exile from the time when mystical creatures made a pact with the human race, and he wants it all back. In all of this we have the story of Hellboy's and Liz's relationship, on the rocks and on fire (sorry), and Abe's first love. I don't know what else to say. Either you will totally like this movie or like a lot of us hope that there is not another sequel coming."
"dee.reid","9","2","3","11 November 2008"," A ""Golden"" Hellboy
","Guillermo del Toro directed ""Hellboy"" in 2004, becoming one of the highest-grossing films of that year. Now four years later, del Toro is behind the camera again to direct (and screen-write) its superior sequel, ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army."" This ""Hellboy"" is more true to the director's visionary style, which saw its best realization in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" in 2006, with its lush, bizarre, and striking visuals that brought the famed Mexican director's wild imagination to life in an effective and brilliant manner.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Mike Mignola's Dark Horse Comics superhero staple, so I eagerly looked to this sequel with joyful anticipation. Demon Prince Nuada (Luke Goss, from del Toro's ""Blade II"") has grown resentful of a centuries-old truce that allows the mythical world to live peacefully alongside their human counterparts. He kills his father and steals the crown that will allow him to awaken the dreaded Golden Army so that he will then be able to lead the Golden Army to conquer all of the known world. To stop him, is Hellboy a.k.a. ""Red"" (the perfectly cast Ron Perlman), his girlfriend, the pyro-kinetic Liz Sherman (the strangely attractive Selma Blair), and amphibious mutant Abe Sapien (Doug Jones).<br/><br/>This movie gets rip-roaring along from the get-go, with its freakish visuals, special effects and witty humor, assuring fans of the original film (and comics) that this will not be a tepid affair. There's really no need to reintroduce the characters here, since del Toro did that in the first movie. Here, he really gets to have fun and lets loose with ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army."" Perlman again proves why he is the perfect actor to play Mignola's Nazi-spawned, wise-cracking, cigar-chomping red demon-superhero. He's simply the best actor for the job, even though he's only recognizable by his voice. More so, his troublesome relationship with Liz Sherman is also put to the test, since she harbors a secret that will either make or break their romantic relationship. And it's this freak/freak drama that makes up the film's emotional core.<br/><br/>Readers know that ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004) is my favorite superhero film (my #2 all-time favorite film) and Spider-Man is my favorite superhero of all time, but Hellboy is one of my best guilty pleasures. ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" certainly ranks as one of the most visually appealing superhero films ever, and one of the best superhero films to come out this year.<br/><br/>9/10"
"saiyanhajime","7","2","3","23 September 2008"," Beautiful cheese
","Far too cheesy for it's own good, this movie.<br/><br/>The saving grace for me is the character design and the fact that so few movies these days can get away with this level of costume and make up. It's just refreshing for me to see non-computer generated beasties! Great creature design and a truly magical visuals, but it sort of lacked in every other department and fell FLAT on several. However, if like me, you kind of like cheesy stories with monsters, it's pretty awesome.<br/><br/>This would have been one of my favourite movies had I watched it when I was about 8, I think."
"truemythmedia","8","1","1","8 August 2019"," Even Better than the Original
","Both ""Hellboy (2004)"" and ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" are really solid superhero films, and I feel like, if they'd have come out five years later when the superhero craze had gotten into full swing, they probably could've done a little bit better in the box office, and maybe we would've wound up with a third Hellboy... maybe, but maybe not. If we had gotten Hellboy 3, maybe Del Toro's career would've taken a very different path, and maybe we wouldn't have gotten ""The Shape of Water""... who knows... that's for an alternate timeline to know. Here, in this universe, in this timeline, we received two Hellboy movies from Del Toro. Not only are those two films brilliant examples of urban fantasy, they are filled with complex and fun characters, and they're an absolute blast to sit through. ""Hellboy II"" is even better than ""Hellboy (2004)"", but both of them are worth watching."
"Mr-Fusion","8","1","1","8 March 2019"," Another go-around with the right hand of doom
","Del Toro already had himself one helluva foundation to build on with the original Hellboy; and here, he leaves a massive fingerprint. The fantasy tone, the humor, the aesthetic, they all bear his trademark; and it works beautifully. This is a sequel done right, happily expanding Selma Blair's role, making quirky use of Seth McFarlane and generally offering an entertaining comic book movie. I love the fight scenes, the surprises, and the best thing is that it leaves me thirsty for more."
"paul_haakonsen","7","1","1","30 December 2018"," Good, but not as good as the first movie...
","I thoroughly enjoyed the 2004 ""Hellboy"" movie, so it was a given that I would of course also watch ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"". And now I have seen it again for the second time here as 2018 is about to ebb out.<br/><br/>While it was not fully up to par with the 2004 ""Hellboy"" movie, ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" is in itself an entertaining enough movie. However, if you have seen the first movie, then it feels like the two are miles apart.<br/><br/>The storyline in ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" was not as interesting as the first movie. Why? Well, I think it was because of the whole introduction of elves, goblins and trolls that just didn't work for me. Sure, monsters and mythological beings feels more at home in this universe in my opinion, but adding a classical fantasy element like elves, goblins and trolls? Nah, not so much. It just felt like a forced attempt of mixing the success from the 2004 ""Hellboy"" movie with elements reminiscent of ""Lord of the Rings"". I wasn't overly impressed.<br/><br/>Visually, then ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" is astounding and downright impressive. There is definitely not spared any expense when it comes to visuals, CGI and practical effects. Everything in the movie looks really amazing, lots of minute details and everything looks very real and genuine. And having such impressive visuals is a must for a movie such as this.<br/><br/>Like the 2004 ""Hellboy"" movie, ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" boasts a rather impressive array of casted actors and actresses to perform the various roles and characters in the movie. Ron Perlman does of course carry the movie with his phenomenal performance as Hellboy himself. And like in the first movie, I was really enjoying Abe Sapiens, played by Doug Jones - just a shame that they didn't have David Hyde-Pierce doing the voice this time, it just was such a crucial part missing from the character in this movie. The Johan Krauss character was really a wonderful one, a comic sidekick of sorts, but he actually was so unique and interesting that he brought a lot of flavor to the movie, and while I am by no means a fan of Seth MacFarlane then I will admit that his voice acting for the Johann Krauss character was just brilliant. It wasn't until now, the second time of watching ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" that I realized that it was Luke Goss that played Prince Nuada, and he actually performed quite well in that role.<br/><br/>The creature designs for ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" was just brilliant and amazing. I love creatures of such broad and unlimited creativity. There were a lot of interesting creatures to be seen throughout the movie, and the whole Troll Market scene was just feeling like something taken right out of a ""Star Wars"" movie, and I loved that. Even the tooth fairies, they were just such a brilliant addition to the movie.<br/><br/>There is a lot of action from the beginning of the movie right up to the very end; which is very much in spirit with the 2004 ""Hellboy"" movie, so that was a major plus in favor of this sequel. And there wasn't really a dull moment throughout the course of the movie.<br/><br/>In itself an enjoyable movie, the whole fantasy flavor just didn't sit well with me. Not that I dislike fantasy with elves, goblins, trolls and such, no no no. It was just not a particularly well-fitting setting for a ""Hellboy"" story in my opinion."

","I didn't like first Hellboy film, so wasn't really looking forward to The Golden Army, sequels rarely being as good as the original. Perhaps it was due to my low expectations that I actually ended up enjoying this one much more. It's still distinctly Del Toro, with the director's trademark steam-punk aesthetic (so many cogs!), and the plot isn't particularly innovative, but the bizarre characters, surfeit of creative Lovecraftian creatures and impressive production design more than make up for a so-so story.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman dons red make-up once again to play the titular character, a demon working for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence. Together with his girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair) and amphibious man Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), Hellboy tries to prevent elvish Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) from activating The Golden Army—a battalion of metal soldiers—and waging war on the human race.<br/><br/>In the process, Hellboy and pals encounter a swarm of ravenous tooth fairies, fight a massive elemental forest god, travel to the troll market where all manner of magickal monsters do trade, and, of course, duke it out with Prince Nuada and his mechanical army. All of this is realised with a stunning array of state-of-the-art special effects, making the film a feast for the eyes, while a keen sense of humour helps to ensure a good time even when the narrative is treading water."
"tritisan","7","1","1","25 June 2009"," Not dark enough, not adult enough
","It really could have been so much richer. I have a feeling that del Toro, an amazing director in his own right, was creatively limited by working with Hollywood execs. (Hollywood has a solid record of importing great foreign directors and turning their work into pulp.) <br/><br/>There was a sense of internal struggle watching this flick; it lacked coherency and solidity. <br/><br/>That said, I did enjoy the phantasmagorical visuals and the Miyazaki-like themes of deep nature impinging on modern life. And the opening sequence of Hellboy-as-all-American boy being mentored by his father figure was deliciously subversive.<br/><br/>Not having read the original graphic novels, I only know Hellboy's character through Perlman's wonderful mug. He manages to play the brutish-yet-sensitive types with a subtle spark of intelligence. I also admired Blair's performance."

","I'm just going to assume that you have watched Hellboy, the first movie, before you read this. I'm not going to spoil anything, about this movie. But I will talk about the characters, that are known from part 1. Hellboy himself is of course the main player, though I liked the fact, that everyone else is getting their own time and development. The actors have fun with their characters, as much as the story allows them.<br/><br/>I think the thin line between serious statements (and decisions that have to be made) and some more lighter funny parts is handled pretty good. The sets and the Art Design is amazing to say the least. I was mesmerized at moments, almost forgetting about what was going on, story-wise and just watched the background and what was happening. I wouldn't be surprised if the movie gets some Oscars in that department! Still this crazy mix, is not for everybody."

"dfranzen70","8","1","1","9 January 2009"," Smash followup kicks butt
","I think Hellboy 2 supersedes the high standard set by Hellboy the First. I never read the comic books, didn’t know anything about Hellboy, didn’t know where he was from, what he was, anything, and the movie addressed all that for me. But after the backstory’s been told, the audience craves something exciting, a tale that makes sense and doesn’t run counter to what they know about the characters.<br/><br/>In Hellboy 2, the Bureau gets a new, er, bureaucrat to replace Dr. Broom (John Hurt, seen in a flashback). Johann Krauss is a disembodied ectoplasmic spirit housed in a diving apparatus. (No, really.) He’s German, so that means he’s rigid and regimental and does things By the Book. I wonder how Hellboy will react to this? The dynamics of the Bureau’s top agents are as muddled as ever. Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and Liz (Selma Blair) are together, but kind of snapping at each other, as if they were a married couple, or something. He’s a lazy slob, she’s a nag, etc. Luckily, Blair and Perlman are both aces here, and they work very well together. Then there’s Abe Sapien, the alien who sounds an awful lot like C-3PO; he’s the brains to Hellboy’s brawn. So really the team is functionally dysfunctional, or something.<br/><br/>The antagonist here is an exiled evil prince who’s trying to revive the Golden Army, a large group of robot monsters that simply cannot be stopped. All he needs is all three parts of an ancient crown, and the world will be his! AHAHAHAHAHAA. The prince looks a lot like Lucius Malfoy, but he’s got the mad ninja skills of a Jackie Chan, so he’s a formidable opponent. He’s also helped by a giant golem, which means we’re sure to see at least two epic battles between Hellboy and Some Bad Guy, causing a boatload of damage to New York City. Along the way, the Bureau’s outed, much to Krauss’s chagrin and to Hellboy’s delight. Tough to be a covert paranormal investigative unit when your pictures are all over the news.<br/><br/>Perlman is an excellent Hellboy - sarcastic, cigar-chomping, fun-loving, and full of crap. So much so, in fact, that you sometimes forget he’s a giant red… thing. But look at him! He’s covered in makeup and prosthetics, and yet it’s Hellboy’s acerbic, witty, pained personality that comes through. That there is some fine acting.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro’s stylish (as always) comic-book movie gets high marks for flash and substance, allowing multilayered, unorthodox characters to seem as regular as the neighborhood mailman, save for the superpowers and massive strength and intelligence. Hellboy 2 is an elegant, ravenous blend of humor, horror, and deadbolt action, a worthy successor to the original."

","I liked Hellboy 1, so I had to watch the sequel. <br/><br/>The sequel is just as good as the first one, interesting storyline, good acting but it has some bad sides, for example the scene with the baby is super-exaggerated .<br/><br/>Like the fact that Hellboy is now in love with ""fire girl"", and are having children. Hated that Krauss guy, I mean o my god, couldn't the writers find a mode interesting character, the 1900's scuba suit is terrible, but idea of a ghost is kind of cool. <br/><br/>Conclusion: In general a good movie with good and bad sides, fun to watch and is definitely not a waste of time."

","Gilliam, Raimi, Jackson and Del Toro. Those four are brothers and partners in crime. The crime being making better movies than anyone else. One of those things these four has in common is a belief that the story is at the center of the action movie. This movie is packed with a very tight story, of course not perfect, but Guilormo does not think lightly of his audience, for he himself is a part of that same audience. He believes that we, the audience, have a brain that can be used and manipulated into having fun. The structure of the story reminds me of a factory of ideas, and like Jackson found a friend in Fran Walsh, equally Del Toro must have spent hours thinking of how to do this right. How not to disappoint. All of us with an acquired taste deserves better than the average Bruckheimer flick. Ideas that dares us to use our imagination, and look past flaws and look at the greater picture. And this story holds every element of adventure, drama, comedy and action and of course we have seen it all before, we have seen villains wanting power to bring back their ways, we have seen humorous anti-heroes fighting for the very existence of mankind, and so on and so forth. And yet this movie is another in the line of movies that does not take themselves too seriously and succeeds in us just having fun. And this movie is yet another chapter in the never ending story of good and evil, and I will never grow tired of watching evil getting smacked up by good. It's like when you meet a person you really like, you want to befriend them. You want to be there when things happen, you want that person to be real, not just some of that usual golf car raging havoc on the streets of new Orleans entertainment. Catch my drift, probably not. In other words, I had fun watching this, I was intrigued by the freshness of it all, and,, look hell-boy says it himself,,<br/><br/>Hellboy: -reading a CD's track listing- ""Can't Smile Without You""? Abe Sapien: I know... Hellboy: Yep, I'm gonna need a beer, too! <br/><br/>just relax, and don't panic. It's just entertainment. D."

","Hellboy II promised non-stop action scenes and a lot of butt whooping on Hellboy's part. However, the only thing that it delivered were stupid comedy scenes that ruined the movie. The first Hellboy delivered not only action but the entire movie was on a serious note, the way these movies should be. The sequel sadly fell into the common path of superhero movies that try to be funny along with delivering action. Guillermo del Toro cannot do this. Between scenes of singing drunken love songs and the locker room scene the entire movie spirals downward to a horrible experience.<br/><br/>Not only does the overdose of comedy kill the movie, there is a huge hole in the plot. King Balor sentences his son, the prince, to death for trying to wage war against the humans. The prince asks his twin sister, whom he shares a link with, if she agrees with the sentence and she does agree. She agrees that he should die. With the link she would also die. So why didn't she sacrifice herself in the first place and commit suicide to stop him? The movie should have been over within the first twenty minutes. But unfortunately for the audience we have to sit through the next two hours.<br/><br/>My recommendation is that this movie is a waste of money. Wait for one of your idiot friends who thinks it is sweet to buy the DVD and watch it for free if you want to suffer through it."
"Calibanhagseed","1","6","15","23 September 2008"," Big Red; Lost in castration.
","Guillermo Del Toro, who's highly decorative and detailed art of film making gave us some reasonably interesting films over the years; now after his Roman Triumph - to which it is equal in decadence -, The Goth-girly fantasy fest of the overrated ""Pan's Labyrinth"", attempted to make a sequel to his earlier far more enjoyable Hellboy flick.<br/><br/>But this time, to draw in the emo cash-cows, with more kitschy schlock after they were saturated with The Jackson abomination, Guillermo saw it fit to trim Big Red of more than his horns, namely Red's trouser twins and make Hellboy a big softy. If Red wasn't bald he would probably have a emo haircut. (I felt like giving you a long list of hyperbolas expressing Red's new sensitivity , but I'll leave you with the superlative, That Del Toro would have made him wear a Jack Skellington hoody if he had his way)<br/><br/>All through out the movie Red's usually phlegmatic one-liners lacked any impact; because Liz would pop up and ""shook his manhood"" and Red just took it like a sort of Jerry Lewis character.(Oye, yes dear.) From a dramatic point of view, wouldn't Hellboy's violent temper, his isolation and his inability to get love Liz even though he has won her heart, serve as a more interesting premise? Apparently the teenage relationship they have in this movie, will appeal to all the sensitive teeny crybabies out there, who would hope that the real Drama would be Liz and Red dealing with Red's metro sexuality after Liz forced him to read Naruto yaoi.<br/><br/>Dealing with metro sexuality; there were elves...ELVES!! When have elves ever been a good idea in a movie! They are the Ewoks of mythology! Oh, now and not just pointy eared elves; No! All new, dark Gothic elves. That being sad, the antagonist was one of the most boring villains I have ever seen,even more boring that Sauron. Most likely he could only be more boring if he were played by William S Macy. And the annoying show-boat kung fu! Kroenen was fun, but this Kung fu was nuking the fridge.<br/><br/>The plot is basically copy-pasted from Lotr and thereby equally dull, and the plot as well conveys the platitudinous sensibilities of alienated and grief-lecherous weirdo's, who identify with the freaks in this movie, Yes Freaks, because that what The Hellboy characters this time have truly been reduced to. Real Tim Burton freaks, who's isolated eccentricities themselves make them superior to the awful humans, that always kill what they don't know! How incredibly pathetic, I for one was cheering on the human assault in the horrible animated puppet-show prologue.<br/><br/>The only real perk of this flick, was the incredibly asynchronous Character of Krauss, voiced by Seth MacFarlane who used the same voice for...Krauss, the ex-DDR Olympian Ski-jumper goldfish. In fact, I expected a goldfish to swim his Krauss' helmet and him to say: ""Ah, Lizz I kan zee yor Schmutz-plätchen."" He was ridiculously entertaining.<br/><br/>Still, like many people said, a monster film is always entertaining, even a bad one, like Hellboy 2 and I can only attest that the production value was phenomenal, and it featured a lot of Animatronics which is a welcome departure from all the CGI, deluding movie magic these day. But if you dress up Steve Buscemi like Frank Sinatra, you are still left with an ugly weirdo in fine threads, this applies to Hellboy 2 as well.<br/><br/>one more thing; ""What ever happened to Danny Elfman? His works is going the way of Zimmer, all thunder, no substance"""

","This movie was completely and utterly atrocious. I felt like i was watching a high school play version of Hellboy. The trolls and stuff looked terrible. The story was far from decent. The only entertaining part of the movie was when he fought the German guy. that was it. I recommend no one go see this movie. Me my friends and my family saw it. We all hated it. The story seemed super cheesy with the prince and the crown bull. what the heck. The troll town looks so fake as well. Hellboy wasn't as funny as in the first. definitely had to have been one of the worst sequels out there. The Shrek sequel topped this one by a long shot. I was extremely disappointed. The first one was awesome. How anyone could like this movie is beyond me."

","If you loved the first Hellboy because of the excellent writing, the great character development, the perfect comic timing of David Hyde Pearce and the nonstop action you will probably be disappointed by Hellboy 2.<br/><br/>My 17 yr old son and I saw it today and we both agreed it was an OK movie but nothing we would recommend or watch once it came out on DVD. David Hyde Pearce is replaced by another voice as Abe Sapien and the replacement is just not funny at all. Agent Myers is also missing from the cast. In the first movie there was almost nonstop action, in this one I was fidgeting the whole movie waiting for the scenes to move along. If Iron Man was a 10, the first Hellboy was a 9, Daredevil was an 8 and Zohan was a 2 then Hellboy2 is a 3 at best."

Ron Perlman has become an absolute lock for predicting a movie will be horrible. Equaled only by the director Del Toro. I'm not sure about the want-to-be EMO chick who steals the whole fire-superhero bit, but I wouldn't trust any film she appears in from now on.<br/><br/>This can basically be summarized as Hellboy tries to become part of the Lord of the Rings. Unoriginal and more deserving of an MPAA lawsuit than somebody who downloads crap like this. The FX are a lot like the money spent on the Iraq war. Impressive in the amount spent, but utterly useless because the story is such a huge dump.<br/><br/>What you should do: write the film corporation and demand your money back for a defective waste of time."

","Prince Nuada: (to Hellboy) That's your weapon of choice? Hellboy: (flexing his stone hand) Five fingered Mary!<br/><br/>Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a helluva hoot, a complement to and departure from the spate of superhero films this summer such as Iron Man, Hancock, Incredible Hulk, and Indiana Jones. The complementing part is obvious: super powers, super problems, super egos, super genre revisioning. The departure is the entrance into the parodic genre stage, where satire dominates.<br/><br/>Hellboy (Ron Perlman's voice) and his rag-tag comrades from the special Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense include the fiery Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) and the delicate Aquaman (Abe Sapien). They must quell a rebellion by a mythical world of creatures that have held back by treaty from fighting humans until the re-emergence of their bellicose Prince Nuada (Luke Goss). Ironic it is that the hellspawn Red has been rejected by both worlds.<br/><br/>The laughs are constant, as the opening dialogue here indicates, and usually from Perlman's Hellboy, such as when he calls his new boss, Germanic Johann Krauss (John Alexander and James Dodd), who is a protoplasmic bureaucrat with a window-like pate, a ""glasshole,"" and then moves on to smoke his Cuban cigar. The days of upright, uptight Superman are gone. <br/><br/>What remains is a combination of Will Smith's hung-over, bad-boy Hancock and Robert Downey's self-indulgent but emerging community-mindedness. Both of these traits are superimposed with an incessant wisecracking that endears Red to the audience and encourages it to forget perfection and enjoy the child-like fun of breaking the rules and poking fun at authority. <br/><br/>Allusions to many sci-fi and fantasy classics abound, most assuredly the market scenes from Star Wars are easily recognized and the ravenous tooth-faerie like creatures could be straight from Lord of the Rings. Drunken Red and Abe singing along to sappy Barry Manilow's ""Can't Smile Without You"" is a classic moment of pop-cult satire.<br/><br/>Blazing Saddles defined this parodic stage of the genre cycle, using the Western's many clichés and poking fun at its conventions (the flatulent campfire is most notable). Director Guillermo del Toro takes his own classic Pan's Labyrinth, mixes it with Mike Mignola's comic book Hellboy, and does it all better. It's a helluva show."

Red's big, rubber hand, while somewhat amusing and necessary for the plot continuity, is still just a BIG RUBBER HAND! Selma Blair's 'Liz Sherman' bursting into flame every once in a while, seemingly randomly, seems contrived. <br/><br/>I'll make this short..... I found it to be mediocre at best.

"Robert_duder","8","4","9","30 July 2008"," Unfortunately points are lost for being an art showing for Guillermo del Toro...which loses some of the Hellboy greatness
","After seeing the first Hellboy again and being generally blown away by the powerful story, strong characters, really emotionally charged super heroes and with a beautiful array of characters and general science fiction greatness I certainly set my expectations high for this sequel. In some ways it was terrific, especially to see the old gang back and getting into their relationships. I definitely had wished character Abe Sapien had played a bigger role in the first one and they brought him to the forefront for the sequel which was awesome...even gave him the romance story line. The reviews started flooding in and they all said the same thing...beautiful, stunning creatures, the brilliance of del Toro...and all that is true but is that why I wanted to see Hellboy on the big screen again? If they managed a balance of stunning artistry and cinematography with the characters and story like they did the first time around then it would have been perfect but it seems like the film makers (del Toro in particular) wanted to use Hellboy 2 to show off his artistry and pretty, pretty designs and the movie suffered a little because of it. I'm not saying it wasn't good...the film was good enough and very entertaining and some genuinely great moments (Abe and Hellboy's drunken love song, the battle with the beast in the streets while Hellboy balances a baby.) Also the relationship that has grown with Hellboy and Liz. Still it didn't quite have the same magic of the original.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman flies back into his incredible role as the one and only Hellboy. He is quite simply amazing and perfect in the role. I didn't feel like he had quite the same biting wit but the character is still amazing and Perlman nails it!! Selma Blair returns as Hellboy's now girlfriend Liz Sherman. I loved her character in the first film, they gave her so much depth and a terrific story and somehow this time around she lacked the same depth and came across as a little cold overall. Still her and Perlman have great chemistry. Doug Jones returns as well as one of my favorite sidekicks Abe Sapien. He gets a much bigger role as I mentioned and that's terrific!! However I felt the missing component was David Hyde Pierce as Abe Sapien's voice. While Doug Jones was good (he is very talented) I still felt like something was missing, like he wasn't quite the same. Pierce has a very distinct talent at voices. Luke Goss is decent as the main bad guy Prince Nuada although from the trailers I kind of expected more from him somehow. Anna Walton is also decent as Princess Nuada and the object of Abe's affection.<br/><br/>Even with all the new demons and monsters and bad guys and a decently solid story the bad guys weren't nearly as good or effective as they were from the first installment. Who could forget Hitler's Assassin with his killer blades, Rasputin and Sammeal. Prince Nuada seems almost useless compared to them. Still the adventure is well in tact and as I stated there are some very cool scenes and plenty of adventure. The Angel of Death was an incredible site to see and Brian Steele who played Sammeal in the original film is terrific as Fragglewump. When all is said and done Hellboy 2 is a solid action summer film but doesn't quite live up to what they started with the original brilliance of the original film. I think they took a step down to let del Toro who has become a bit of an icon do his thing and it took away from the core idea of the film. Still well worth seeing if you love Hellboy like I do. 8/10"

Wunderkind filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's fantastic sequel to his collaboration with/on Mike Mignola's cult comic book hero, Hellboy (Perlman coming across as a cross between Lee Marvin and a strawberry colored Twizzler), this time with the world-weary demon spawn facing a rebellious elf prince (Goss, a cross between Iggy Pop and Legolas from LORD OF THE RINGS) wanting to sever the agreement between mankind and the subterranean otherworld denizens by unleashing the titular soldiers of misfortune. Blair and Jones lend able support reprising their roles as Big Red's main squeeze, fire starter extraordinaire Liz Sherman and empathetic aquatic creature Abe Sapien, respectively. Added to the mix is protoplasmic mystic Johann Krauss (voiced by MacFarlane), new leader of the secret US organization The Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD) with his no-nonsense, Teutonic ways of dealing with adversity within the ranks; and ethereal Walton as the elf princess twin sister who also provides a love interest for Abe. Del Toro gets his cinematic ya-yas out by employing some truly dazzling SFX and homages to Ray Harryhausen, STAR WARS' cantina sequence, Barry Manilow (!) and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. Rock'em, sock'em rousing entertainment all around. Hell'z yeah!"
"BartDudeInX","7","4","9","13 July 2008"," Hellboy 2 is Golden
","First off, I loved the first ""Hellboy"". It turned me onto the fantastic comic books by Mike Mignola as well as the great films of Guillermo del Toro. For me the combination of evil occult-seeking Nazis, monstrous Lovecraftian gods, and a blue-collar, half-demon monster hunter was just too much exciting material too resist. It was funny, exciting, and filled with awesome visuals.<br/><br/>Now, after a dreadful 4 year wait, we finally have the sequel. All the major players in front of and behind the scenes return (except for Rupert Evans's Agent Myers character and composer Marco Beltrami, whose great music from the first has been replaced in this one by a serviceable, but not too memorable, score by Danny Elfman). Ron Perlman, Doug Jones, Jeffrey Tambor, and Selma Blair all return to their roles from the first one with vigor and excitement. There's even a small cameo by John Hurt in the beginning.<br/><br/>The story was a clever turn away from the events of the first one, focusing more on fantasy instead of Lovecraftian tentacled monsters and robot-Nazi zombies. In this one we get the wise-cracking, monster-smashing Hellboy and his team taking on flesh-eating fairies, monstrous trolls, towering forest elementals, and an indestructible robotic army. The story is pretty simple: a power-mad elf prince from the underworld realm has decided that the greedy, wasteful, and destructive behavior of humankind is threatening the realm of fantasy creatures, and decides to strike back by waging war on them. So it is up to Hellboy and his friends to stop him.<br/><br/>Now while the plot itself is nothing new or extraordinary, everything else is pretty impressive. All the actors give good performances and seem to be relishing a return to del Toro's Hellboy world. Ron Perlman is particular is awesome--truly born to play the part of Hellboy. The two love stories--between Hellboy and Liz, and Abe and the evil prince's twin sister--are touching and lead to some humorous bits. The introduction of the ectoplasmic German agent Johann Krauss to the team is an especially memorable and funny character, complete with some amazing effects. The actions scenes are cool, well-choreographed and fun to watch. Something that Del Toro really does well is make these monsters and ""freaks"" into real characters with real emotions and feelings, making them instantly relate-able.<br/><br/>The main reason to watch this film though is to see the visuals that del Toro conjures. They are among the best in the fantasy/action/superhero genre. His combination of practical make-up effects and amazingly well-done CGI are truly an impressive and beautiful visual feast. The visit to the Troll Market with its hundreds of monster denizens is delightful. The sinister and extremely creepy Angel of Death sequence near the end is powerful in its imagery and the plot threads it sets up for a possible third film. The battle with the Forest Elemental on the Brooklyn Bridge is amazing--as is the gentle, beautiful aftermath. And of course, the appearance of the menacing and powerful Golden Army at the climax, and the following confrontation is awesome! <br/><br/>The film does have a few flaws however. The most notable one is the opening prologue with John Hurt and the young Hellboy. The makeup, acting, and audio synchronization in that scene is absolutely cringe-inducing and the only major misstep in the film. Other than that, though, the other flaws are minor. The psychic/physical link between the evil prince and his sister is a little convenient and leaves a few noticeable plot holes. There are a few comic bits near the beginning that don't gel as well as they should. But once the film gets going it is an exciting adventure.<br/><br/>It's safe to say that if you're a fan of the first ""Hellboy"" or any of Guillermo del Toro's work, you'll definitely enjoy this one. If you weren't a fan of the first, it's hard to say whether or not this one will be your particular cup of tea. For me, though, I found ""Hellboy II"" to be a fun, touching, exciting, and visually thrilling experience.<br/><br/>Pros: The Troll Market. The Elemental battle on the Brooklyn Bridge. The character of Johann Krauss. The one-eyed, mechanical-handed monster troll Mr. Wink. Abe Sapien's expanded role. The Angel of Death sequence. Hellboy and Johann's hilarious locker room confrontation. Hellboy and Abe getting drunk and singing along to Barry Manilow (hands down the funniest scene I've seen all year). The Golden Army and the final confrontation.<br/><br/>Cons: The young Hellboy in the prologue. The ""twin link"" between the Prince and his sister. The fairly generic score by Danny Elfman. (I love Danny Elfman's scores, but this one pales next to the memorable themes that Marco Beltrami created for the first film.) <br/><br/>All in all, ""Hellboy II"" may be one of the best films of the summer, and definitely one of the most entertaining. Hopefully it will do well enough that we will see a ""Hellboy III"" within the next 5 years. Del Toro has left open some exciting and ominous plot threads that foreshadow a darker, apocalyptic third chapter. I'm all for another return to del Toro's ""Hellboy"" world."
"paveltsvetkov","9","4","9","11 July 2008"," Would you sacrifice the world to give life to your loved one?
","I am a fan of part one and therefore could not wait to lay my eyes on the sequel. Finally, it did ""come to a cinema near me"" - in the form of a preview shown at an awkward time. I did not think twice - even if I had to pay extra and stay late.<br/><br/>The movie started slow. First, they showed us - in a couple of dated stills - the history of the prequel: how Hellboy was originally found - and then jumped a few years into the future to tell us how he first learned about the Golden Army. This first scene - with the little red horned boy brushing his teeth - left me with mixed feelings, it looked so odd and out of context.<br/><br/>However, the film starts to pick up speed and really gets better by the minute. Prince Nuada is introduced with his swift martial arts moves that - I dare say - put to shame some of the scenes in the Matrix. But most importantly - the story is well thought through and when you think about it after leaving the cinema, it still ""holds water"" so nothing of the beautiful imagery is spilled.<br/><br/>And beautiful it is! It is breathtakingly hauntingly beautiful... There are so many fantastic characters, real and unreal blend perfectly - both the work of the CGI experts and the writers of the script. Most if not all characters are designed and executed with such perfect attention to detail on both levels - philosophical and visual - that it must really take a lot of thinking to find a weak spot.<br/><br/>But trust me when I tell you, that you will not have a lot of time left for thinking. The visual storytelling talents of Del Toro have always been praised, but here the strength of their expression truly reaches a peak! Elves, Trolls, Gods of the forest and Giants of stone - one might think that he has seen it all in the LODR trilogy, however this director's vision is something else. Elves are white and ethereal but there is also something wicked in their chalky faces and cat-like eyes. Trolls are ugly, menacing and at the same time - comic. There is a plethora of cunning gadgets and a universe of seamless magic co-existing in an uneasy equilibrium in Hellboy 2.<br/><br/>There are also some laughs - well thought through and perfectly timed - that were maybe missing from part one. But the most interesting of it all lies not in the visual stunts or clever tricks - it is in the simple fact that this film tells a moving story that touches the heart. It is a story about love and what it can make us do: betray and kill those closest to us, or lay our life down to save them - and be ready to destroy the world in the process...<br/><br/>Remember I told you that the film gradually picks up speed? This masterful dance gets almost hectic towards the end - both visually, philosophically and emotionally. The mechanics of the Golden Army are deadly and perfect in their own way. Our hero saves the day, but we are told that he lives for the world to get destroyed. ""Would you sacrifice everything you know to give life to your loved one?"" It seems that there is no correct answer to this question. And if that is so, then we are all going down in flames - just like Guillermo del Toro predicts in this second installment of his Hellboy saga.<br/><br/>Go watch this movie. It is better than the polished and hollow 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', because it has heart. It is much better than 'Wanted', because it is visually stunning, but not showy and it has moral integrity. It is even better than 'The Hulk' - which is the best of the three mentioned but still looks one-dimensional and shallow when compared to del Toro's masterpiece. I would not say it is perfect... but for its kind it is not just engaging - it is captivating, and it is a lesson in philosophical storytelling, given by a Master."

"Anonymous_Maxine","9","3","6","24 February 2009"," Hellboy Discovers His Love of Tecate and YouTube  'Hellboy II' Review
","Hellboy II starts off in the same kind of story-telling style that The Princess Bride began with, although with a noticeably different romantic content. We see Hellboy as a young boy, and his adoptive father is reading to him a legend about an ancient warfare that has existed between humans and all manner of otherworldly beings for as long as anyone cares to remember. He listens with intense fascination as he learns of the tentative truce that was reached between the humans and the underworld, sealed by the separation and distribution of the Royal Crown of Bethmoora, the holder of which achieves power over the Golden Army. The humans thus took residence in the cities and the trolls and monsters have agreed to stay in the forests.<br/><br/>But due to deforestation and ever-expanding cities, there is some understandable unrest taking place among the underworld, and a Prince Nuada takes it upon himself to cancel the truce and reopen the battle with the humans. The Golden Army is described in the movie as 70 times 70 slumbering warriors, which adds up to 4,900, if my calculations are correct, and if less than 5,000 warriors are able to endanger the entire human race at a time of advances military technologies, then I guess that paints something of a picture of what kind of warriors these things are. <br/><br/>The plot is decidedly more complicated than the original film, so suffice it to say that there are Prince Nuada and the demons on one side, and Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman, and Princess Nuala (Nuada's twin sister) fighting on the human side. A romance developing between Abe and Princess Nuala is complicated by the fact that any injuries that Nuada sustains are suffered identically by his twin sister, and he must be killed to be stopped.<br/><br/>There is no use in describing the battle that takes place between Hellboy and his sidekicks and the demons in the movie, except to say that the special effects are absolutely phenomenal. There are enormous, sweeping feats of CGI taking place in this movie, and trust me, that really means a lot coming from someone like me. I generally feel that CGI and other similar special effect detract more from a movie more often than they add anything, but Hellboy II has some of the best special effects I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Hellboy has also let go of a lot of his timid approach to fame that we saw in the first movie, where he kept himself much more hidden. Now, he enjoys making public appearances, and even waves and gives autographs. <br/><br/>The troll market and the way the underworld is made to exist within our own world are two of the movies strongest points. It is a film of visual wonders that are so well done you can almost feel them. I was reminded at various points of some of my older favorites, like The Goonies, Labyrinth, Time Bandits, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Aliens, The Cell, The Iron Giant, and that old Nintendo game, Life Force. Remember that thing? Classic!<br/><br/>I was unimpressed with Pan's Labyrinth, but it was a step-up in the visual worlds that Guillermo del Toro was creating after the original Hellboy film, and the first Hellboy sequel is in turn a step up from that. What the next leap in visual imagery that del Toro comes up with I can't begin to imagine, but for now Hellboy II is more than enough to keep us occupied."
"hokum15","3","3","6","12 September 2008"," Why, why, why, del Toro?!!
","I liked the first Hellboy and pretty much love everything else del Toro has done, but I am SO exasperated about this sequel, so much that I'm writing a comment which I hardly ever do! There are only about 3 redeeming things about this film in my opinion (let's start with the positives!) - firstly, the creatures are on the whole really creative and unmistakably del Toro, in particular King Balor's briefly-seen soldiers and the creepy Chamberlain character, and the freaky Angel of Death. The tooth fairies were pretty cool too although the Golden Army itself lacked imagination visually. Secondly the Krauss character was mildly amusing even if he did suffer from bad dialogue (""suck my ectoplasmic something or other""...CRINGE!) and he was no replacement for Agent Myers, the human member of the team through whose eyes we were first introduced to the crazy world of Hellboy. His absence is explained away hastily in one clumsy line - it seems Hellboy sent him away because he still saw him as a rival for Liz's affections, even though he seemed to make peace with him at the end of the first film and accept him? Thirdly (this is so minor but I thought I'd mention it) the goblin they meet in Co.Antrim had a basically authentic Northern Irish accent - it would have been so easy to use a stereotypical comedy ""sure an' begorra"" accent as many audiences outside Britain may not have detected the difference but they went with the right accent which was good to see. Although, wasn't it annoying the way the place and time kept flashing up every other scene? That wasn't always needed. <br/><br/>My main bugbear is that I think there were too many action sequences - too many weird and wonderful characters and show-downs crammed in - you have the tooth fairies, the Scottish troll thing, then the troll market, then the utterly stupid looking CGI plant thing which was so powerful yet was easily dispatched by a couple of bullets (all done while Hellboy was holding a baby, which I feel was only put in so we could be shown that HELLBOY IS COMFORTABLE WITH BABIES - Ooh, that's lucky, cos he's gonna be a Dad! more on that later), then the giant, then the angel of death, then finally (phew!) the lacklustre and easily defeated army. I'm sure del Toro could have saved at least a bit of this for the next film which is so obviously going to happen (Krauss hastily and clunkingly refers to his lost love, which there's 'time to explain about later'). <br/><br/>Acting - not great, especially the Princess (particularly the ""No, brother, no!"" line which I nearly burst out laughing at, it was so wooden!) I normally love Selma Blair but she just looked stroppy in this one and had none of the depth she had as Liz in the original. I've never really seen what is the fuss is about Ron Perlman - I just don't think he's anything special. Manning was a great character in the first one but in the sequel he just skirts around Hellboy and has none of his attitude from the original - I felt that Jeffrey Tambor's talent was wasted here. Luke Goss was actually very good, I was sorry to see his character killed. <br/><br/>The 'Liz 4 Hellboy' storyline has always seemed a little far-fetched to me anyway and I've heard that it doesn't actually happen in the comics (not sure?), but of course this is a Hollywood film so the hero has to be in a relationship, but del Toro has actually gone even further into the the 'let's make Hellboy normal' territory - oh my God, they're gonna be PARENTS. This is something I REALLY did not see coming, and to be honest the film lost me when Liz's pregnancy is discovered. I have some real issues with the ridiculousness of this plot turn! As if the opening with the cheesy young Hellboy (who is holding a doll or teddy and then a toy pistol, like all kids permanently do - yes we can see that he's a kid, he doesn't have to always be holding toys to drive this home to us) wasn't schmaltzy enough, and just an obvious way to get John Hurt squeezed into the sequel, we're now gonna get not one but two wisecracking and ultimately no doubt thoroughly irritating half-demon, half-human children hanging off Hellboy's back in the next film?! (shudders) That's one reason I'll be avoiding it! But further to this, call me pedantic, I know it's a fantasy story, it's not meant to be realistic, but why isn't Liz a little apprehensive about carrying two children who may each, for instance, be partially made of stone?! Or be huge like their father? How the hell's she going to carry them, what effect would it have on her physically?! It seems unrealistic that they both just accept that obviously it's going to be a completely 'normal' pregnancy with no risk to Liz's health or the babies'. Stupid, stupid idea! <br/><br/>This film had none of the del Toro magic and seemed to be made for teenagers or even older children. By the time they unleashed the golden army, I just didn't care anymore what happened to anyone, I was looking up at the ceiling, sighing and waiting for the end. Del Toro didn't even need this sequel, it was fine ending where it did. Fingers crossed he'll be back on form with the Hobbit. <br/><br/>All in all, a great film for youngsters and anyone in a light entertainment mood, but ultimately I think del Toro fans will be very disappointed. Rent on DVD if you're curious but I'd say put Cronos, Pan's Labyrinth or even Blade 2 in your DVD player instead of paying to see this."

Instead expect a plethora of stunning visuals accompanied by a healthy dose of tongue-in-cheek humor. This is in every sense of the word an effects movie, with loads and loads and loads of CGI. However, unlike in many similar films, the effects are used very effectively and creatively, to bring a bizarre and yet attractive fantasy world to life and inhabit it with creatures that are equally bizarre and yet attractive. Go see it for a good 120 minutes of pretty pictures and a couple of good laughs.

","I have never been a fan of tearing apart a film and highlighting its negative and positive qualities and in a year where good films a few and far between, you can't help but hope there's a decent one around the corner. Unfortunately, Hellboy 2 is not one of them. I saw this film at a preview screening last night in Australia and I was underwhelmed. The opening sequence, in particular young Hellboy's makeup, was comical and you just couldn't take it seriously. It left you wondering whether the whole film would be that bad. While the film did improve, it relied heavily on visual effects to hold your attention. With a thin storyline and very little character development, this movie jumped between scenes and left you wanting more. Moderately entertaining, Hellboy 2 is not a movie I would see again and I believe it could have been much better. Using my simple method of pass or fail, unfortunately - Fail. That said, one mans lemon is another's candy, so go see it and decide for yourself."

I'd give it a 0 out of 10, but I can't. Perhaps it is simply not my genre of film.<br/><br/>I think nowadays the movies are all about beautiful special effects and don't give any attention to the plot.

"sine-10","6","3","7","15 August 2008"," Far less than the sum of it's parts.
","Seems like Del Toro thought up a bunch of cool looking characters and then shoehorned them into a messy sprawling plot where I ended up caring about no one in the movie. Lots of decent moments, but the result was far less than the sum of it's parts. I loved the first one, but I think del Toro should stop directing movies and go back to being a story board or concept artist. Come on, after Blade 2 we let this guy make another movie? Note, I'm not a fan of Pan's Labyrinth either. Again, a beautiful movie that just rambles around with a lot of material that doesn't really contribute much to the story or character development.<br/><br/>So we end up with a parade of amazing looking characters yet we never learn their origins or motivations. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but it's in the title so I guess it's not a give away but they barely give the guy who created the golden army anything to say at all. We've got a great looking villain that's totally one dimensional. The great thing about Hellboy is that he's ""born of evil"" yet he overcomes his origin to be good. There's almost none of that kind of conflict in this movie at all aside from a half hearted attempt at the end of a scene mid way though the movie but it creates no real tension.<br/><br/>Also, del Toro, how about editing? You spent extra money to make a movie longer which didn't make it any deeper, just rambling. A shorter, tighter movie would cost less to make, have the potential to be shown more times in a day and would end up being a stronger narrative."

","PAN'S LABYRINTH smashed up against the Cantina Sequence from STAR WARS and Guillermo del Toro rode that bad boy all the way to a town called HELLBOY.<br/><br/>In HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY, writer-director del Toro has concreted his gleaming vision, found his devil stride, piling spectacle upon wonder upon bombastic fantastic. From Mike Mignola's comicbook character, music by Danny Elfman, Ron Perlman reprising his red-skinned lead role (his insouciance outa control), and eye-candy enough to choke a fragglewump, we almost touch heaven. Throw in Barry Manilow (*Can't Smile Without You*) and it's hell in a leather longcoat.<br/><br/>Sequel to HELLBOY (2004, also del Toro's baby) opens with a prologue on his origin (spewed from a dimensional rift during WWII and adopted by American military as defender against paranormal evil), then into a kooky sequence showing Hellboy as a uh, hell BOY (who still, surprisingly, looks like Ron Perlman  but acts like Beaver Cleaver). As young Hellbie watches Howdy Doody, so too are we treated to a puppet show  in old-school stop-motion  as Hellbie's adopted father (John Hurt, phoning in a cameo) reads him a bedtime story  The Legend of the Golden Army, one of those completely illogical sagas that somehow transmogrifies into as ""history"" (like the bible). Suffice to say, the Golden Army should not be woken from their endless slumber. Of course, that's JUST what a crazed albino guy does <br/><br/>Prince Nuada (played with sneering British contempt by accomplished music artist, Luke Goss) is the non-human albino guy so rampantly annoyed at everything we surmise he never got enough hugs as a child. (Yet if he hates humans so much, how come he's always speaking English when everyone in the underground kingdom is speaking Undergroundese?) Kills his king dad for a piece of crown to wake the Golden Army; has to kill his albino sis (Anna Walton) for the last piece, but she lams it with Abe Sapien, who immediately falls in love with her even though she's another species.<br/><br/>In HELLBOY, it seemed like the paranormal was battling to infiltrate the Real World: in GOLDEN ARMY, the paranormal exists side-by-side with us. Del Toro tries to establish a MEN IN BLACK nonchalance during the opening scenes, showing all manner of wackiness in the paranormal academy, while Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor) and Abe Sapien walk right past these oddities while chatting. MEN IN BLACK did it better.<br/><br/>It is too contrived here, especially when introducing Hellboy and his manic-depressive firestarter chick, Liz (still Selma Blair), in a stagey couple-fight that makes us feel dirty. Doug Jones is still blue and gilled and ineffectual as Abe Sapien the fish-guy. They are joined by ""ectoplasmic expert,"" Johann Krauss (James Dodd, voiced by Seth McFarlane), who looks like a 1950s movie spaceman.<br/><br/>Abe Sapien reminds me of Aquaman from DC's Justice League - unless evil was being perpetrated UNDERWATER, he was pretty useless. Abe is an empath, but he is neither a fighter nor a lover; the mentality of a fifteen-year-old virgin boy, which doesn't help when you're confronting foes like WINK  Nuada's steel-fisted, ten-foot troll.<br/><br/>Movie moves quickly from one spectacular vignette to the next  many times leaving strands dangling, which is why it has *verve*, but lacks *balls*; from the tooth fairy inundation, to the Troll Market (where even 100 viewings would not be enough to assimilate the visually-drooling alienscape), to Hellboy battling an Elemental (a tree-giant forest god that Nuada unleashes to kill Hellboy when he could have simply knifed him instead).<br/><br/>During the tree battle, Nuada almost poignantly entreats Hellboy to Come-To-the-Dark-Side, touching on this movie's theme (that the movie itself runs from like a maniac)  that the very humans Hellboy protects look upon him warily as an outsider. When the forest god dies, it covers the ground with foliage, planting doubt that the humans might in fact be prohibiting Earth-friendly, natural elements from thriving.<br/><br/>Before the dissent can wend its way through Hellboy's filed-down horn-growths, he's hitting something else with his Five-Fingered Mary.<br/><br/>When Hellboy's life hangs in the balance, they approach the Angel of Death  a four-winged, hissing, eyeless thing who warns that if Hellboy is revived, his destiny is to destroy Earth with his mystical rock-fist. So Liz  thinking with her woman-bone instead of her head, chooses Hellboy's life over the Earth's existence  mighty white of her! Maybe because Hellboy has been busy with his hell-bone and Liz is carrying his, uh, hellspawn  so I guess she doesn't want to raise the little devil (literally) on her own what would the paranormal neighbors say?...<br/><br/>The inevitable TRANSFORMERS moment arrives when the titular Golden Army comes to life  ""70 times 70 warriors"" (let's call it 4900 for the mathematically-challenged)  all eye-bending CGI machinery, and Hellboy and Krauss go into battlebot mode while Liz and Sapien stand around and hope we don't notice them behind the special effects.<br/><br/>As in the original HELLBOY, these dead-end moments are many, where del Toro drops story threads and hopes he will get by on spectacle alone. But if Abe Sapien can learn to cry (even though he has no tear ducts), I'm sure del Toro will one day learn to balance spectacles and testicles."

The action scenes were not as good as expected save the final action sequence. The plot about the mystical world going to war with humans sounds like a very interesting concept, however it never really goes anywhere and is anti-climatic.

"RICKYD2000","6","3","7","21 July 2008"," Not so impressed
","Hellboy 2: The Golden Army I must admit right off the bat that I�m disappointed by the crop of superhero movies I�ve seen this summer. Originally, I wanted to see all six of them but that soon changed once I saw �Iron Man�. It left me severely unsatisfied while �The Incredible Hulk� just barely fed my cravings for ultra-violence. What else awaited me? �Hancock� and �Wanted�. I didn�t need to see those, thank you, and I crossed my fingers for a Hellboy sequel that would knock my dirty socks off.<br/><br/>My socks were on quite tightly in anticipation of seeing Bid Red once again. I knew it would take something special to impress me, as sequels don�t usually make it into my favorite DVDs, yet I reserved a special kind of hope for this one, having enjoyed the first Hellboy back in 2004. What bothered me most this time around is the fact that we, the viewers, are repeatedly patronized by the movie studios. Each sequel gives us the same treatment: develop the love story, make it seem like the main character will die by the end of the movie and throw in a couple lame gags for the lower-IQ crowd. Some of us have actually seen a lot of movies and we�re fed up with this generic garbage! But hey, if it�s a success at the box office, why stop there? Let�s make 8 of them! OK, that was a little harsh. The story wasn�t that bad, keeping in mind that most comic book adaptations are a lot worse (Superman 3 anyone?). We�re subjected to the developments between Liz and Hellboy, and although it holds no significant importance to the grandeur of the movie, it does provide a few chuckles, as well as a juicy hint about another sequel� The real reason we paid $12 to see this movie is to witness Hellboy destroy everything in sight, either with his gargantuan fist or his weapons. The real highlight in this movie, however, is the attention to detail. Guillermo Del Toro paints his prettiest canvas yet by creating the most visually stunning movie since Pan�s Labyrinth. The screen oozes with color and grandiosity, bringing us tantalizingly close to the myriad of characters Hellboy meets. The scene where he ventures into the troll market remains particularly vibrant in my mind. I was easily glued to the screen the entire time, trying to register every little detail that was projected back to me. Del Toro�s gutsy approach to filming and cinematography is one that more directors should employ.<br/><br/>So the entire premise is rather clich�d. Nothing here that hasn�t been told before. Yet by using the best visual elements from �Pan�s Labyrinth�, Del Toro stays true to the genre and entertains us to the end with an eclectic cast and creative action sequences. The success of the franchise will undoubtedly produce a third movie but a warning to anyone who hasn�t seen this yet: don�t expect the unexpected. Go in with a fresh mind, without expectations and you should thoroughly enjoy yourself.<br/><br/>Naked Lunch Radio"

","Hellboy II thrives in all areas; the performances are top-notch, the script is sharp, and the production and make-up design is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. Director Guillermo del Toro has followed up 2006's masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth with one of the best movies of the summer.<br/><br/>When the Heir to the Throne of an ancient civilization of elves plots to awaken the deadly and indestructible Golden Army, it is up to the societal outcasts at the Federal Bureau for Paranormal Research to save the day, once again led by their witty, charismatic, and endearing leader Hellboy.<br/><br/>As far as fantasy films go, this one might go down in my book as one of the best. The monsters are something amazing to behold, creations to stick with you long after you leave the theater. The action sequences are well-shot and quick. The special effects deliver perfectly. Most amazing of all though, is the real character and endearing story injected into all of it. It's easy to fall in love with these freaks, especially played to such perfection by Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, and Doug Jones.<br/><br/>I suppose I can see how Hellboy would not delight everyone. It is a fantastical story, not based at all in reality and it is a film that delights in making it's audience chuckle. For me that ability to laugh makes it all the more endearing. Easily one of my favorite films of the summer! 8/10 stars!<br/><br/>Jay Addison"
"ian-cutajar","8","3","7","13 July 2008"," A Fine Film for Fantasy Fans
","I'd like to address the opinions that many IMDb'ers seem to have. The general mindset from this site seems to be one thing: absolute opinions. Either people say they love a movie, or they hate it. They say it's great, or it is full of fail. I say Hellboy II is neither great, nor awful. Instead, I say it is an ARCHETYPAL movie. Some people give that word another meaning, ""predictable"". I, on the other hand, strongly disagree. While people say that a movie is bland for having unsurprising events, I say that they are sadly mistaken. After all, it is archetypes that give a movie its theme. With that being said, it is true that, in order for a movie to be outright outstanding, they truly need something special, in order to shine. Breaking away from archetypes is normally the way of doing so. As such, there must be some things that give this movie a great appeal.<br/><br/>The plot is a rather common one, but as I have already said, this is an archetypal film in many ways. Although the general plot is what is expected, the fine details are the things that I've enjoyed through the film. I went to this film, curious to see one thing: Character design. As such, I was more than pleasantly surprised. Yes, it's true that some characters aren't as three-dimensional as one would hope, but let us face facts; it is a two-hour long film, and people are called SECONDARY characters for a reason  not a lot of detail is given about them.<br/><br/>The physical character designs left a person completely fulfilled. Knowing the director was the same from Pan's Labyrinth, I was overly excited to see some new, neat monsters, and was happily pleased. There are plenty of small details which should make a person smile, such as Abe's breathing apparatus showing plenty of air bubbles floating up, whenever he is obviously nervous, scared, or in trouble. Even the characters' attitudes left a great deal of glee. Hellboy is one unique superhero, while Abe is no different. Furthermore, Seth MacFarlane (writer of American Dad, producer of Family Guy) made a beautifully mastered Johann Krauss, who should leave everyone in smiles.<br/><br/>Now, I'm afraid people will ignore this review, should I write much more. As such, I'd like to bring it to a quick close. Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a fine addition to the comic book life on the big screen. While I have seen many polar opposite beliefs on the quality of the film (it sucked vs. it was the best film ever), I'd advise watching it for yourself, and making your own opinions. Should you be interested in fantasy movies, I would highly recommend Hellboy II."
"cultfilmfan","8","3","7","12 July 2008"," Hellboy 2: The Golden Army
","Hellboy 2: The Golden Army is based upon the comic book of the same name by Mike Mignola and was previously a live action film entitled ""Hellboy"" in 2004. In the film a beer drinking and cigar smoking misunderstood mutant with attitude who also acts as a superhero along with a special team set up by the government, has more on his plate to deal with when some other mystical creatures with evil plans come around and an above average comic book film with outstanding makeup, sets and special effects follow. In case you have not already noticed, 2008 is definitely the year of the comic book movie. We have gone from Iron Man to the Hulk and this summer's most anticipated superhero movie The Dark Knight hasn't even been released yet. To some people all these hero movies must be someone's dream summer for movies, I on the other hand am getting tired of it real quick. I would much rather be watching an original thought provoking character study, or just something entirely new and not based upon previously published material like a comic book, video game, television series, etcetera. I guess I will probably have to wait till fall to get my wish. It's not like Hellboy 2: The Golden Army is a bad film, no far from it, but it still follows the same type of hero formula that we have seen all too often in past years and even within the first few summer months of this year with the kind of films the distributors are releasing. Hellboy 2 is probably a lot better than the previous hero films of the summer because it's makeup and visuals are outstanding and almost cry for effects Oscars and there was a good deal of humour, personality and even edge to these characters and the story, which made it more than just a cliché of these type of films. A lot of the different creatures in this film look fantastic and to design some of these things one must admit and admire all the talent that went behind it. Still there was enough in here that was fairly predictable and by the books. Had it been a little darker, or spent a little more time with these characters that were more interesting than the plot itself, than it could have been a lot better. Also, I found that the film did drag a bit in the second half and I was beginning to lose interest. Judging by the online reviews and the reviews of critics, I'm sure this film will be a hit commercially and with the film going audience. And while it is not a bad film it is still nothing new, or exciting and I probably would have had more of an experience seeing one of my own movies in my collection. 2008 is so far a very weak year for movies, especially compared to last year's really good line-up, and one can hope that it will only get better."

","Slightly better story wise then the original but that's not saying much. The focus is less character driven and more on just the next adventure of these characters. I guess we can't have both, that would take some intelligent writing and this is a super hero flick. Ron Perlman now owns the character of Hellboy, he has him down pat, unfortunately it just feels like a retread of the first Hellboy. Selma Blair is just plain awful, no point or purpose to her character really. With all that said you would expect a low ratting but surprise, that's not going to be the case. Guillermo del Toro is a visual genius, this movie is beautiful, his creature creations are amazing to look at and the special effects are great. The look of the film was just to good to let little things like story and acting bring it down. Also there is also a very memorable singing scene that I just loved, yes you heard me right."

","When I had watched the first ""Hellboy"" movie in 2004, I had watched it without having read the comic book series first and was curious to see how these interesting characters would come into play on film. Had I read the comics books I would have had a better understanding towards the characters and the story. Never the less, just like any other movie, it should be watched without any prejudice, distortion, or comparison to the books or any other film. The movie, unfortunately, had fallen flat and I will not even begin to explain the many disappointing factors that had made the film not enjoyable.<br/><br/>Now again, I had given ""Hellboy 2"" a chance without being bias or having the need to compare it with the first one and once again without having the knowledge from the comics. Compared to the first movie, it will blow it out of the water and as a stand alone, it is a phenomenal, well crafted movie.<br/><br/>They gave more depth to the characters by giving them personalities with needs and flaws not just by looking cool with special powers, including the main villain which is my favorite. All the new characters were well design with high production value which reminded me of the great works of the Jim Henson studio. From a conceptually point of view the character designs were well worked into the story to add more of a contrast between the human world and the world of ""Hellboy"".<br/><br/>It was also pretty obvious that they took the time to explore the world of Hellboy and its characters and because of that we were given even more spectacular events, cooler gadgets, better superpower abilities and greater action scenes.<br/><br/>At the end the movie there was still a good moral message ,even though, it was built around a character(and from my understanding) the devil child who was originally suppose to wipe the human race out of existence by bringing on the apocalypse but instead decided to buy a house (probably in the suburbs with a white picket fence as well) to raise his kids. Over all it was great and anyone who hasn't read the comic books will very much enjoy the movie."
"hoove1970","6","4","11","10 July 2008"," Helloromances? Overly critical? perhaps....
","Well here I am with another difficult film to review. I went to the preview 7/8/08 in Hartford CT. The crowd that was there was enthusiastic, even though it was not a packed house. I have been trying to classify this movie.... I started out assuming it was a comic book action adventure, I then cam to realize that Del Toro intended this to be a comedy. Wait, now I think its an attempt at at a love story slap stick comedy. OK I have to give up on labeling it!I'm not sure what the intentions were. But I know I left there with the impression that I had just seen a complicated conglomeration of several different movie genres. It wanted to be a comic book action thriller, but spent too much time and tried too hard at being schmaltzy and comedic.<br/><br/>Hellboy seemed to reach for every possible joke you could squeeze out of the, "" ... Believe it or not - he's the good guy..."" tag line. I think we understood that much out of the first movie. Being beaten over the head with it was a bit painful.. I had the same type of experience in the Disney movie ""Enchanted"", milking the jokes based upon the most unlikely juxtaposition possible for every possible guffaw! I thought Del Toro would have built on the solid action/comic style more in stead of building the love relationship as it were. The loss of Agent Myers was a detrement to the ensemble. Yes they set up the third movie with 2 main story lines that were laid down here, but the whole movie almost seemed like a primmer to the next installment. I am hoping the franchise gets back down to business in that one.<br/><br/>Sadly the plot spent very little time with the Golden Army itself... it seemed like they had very big plans then ran out of money and thought up a faster cheaper ending. There was a whole host of nit picky things in this movie that bothered me too. First, young Hellboy did not seem to be in character and the prosthetics he wore were clumsy and poorly done. To me it was not very believable. The love relationship of Hellboy and Liz was not quite right either. It was like only one day passed since the ending of the last movie... and here we find our plucky new lovebirds already having rough times. It was not a plausible plot to me. I kept finding myself almost verbalizing my disbelief in how they handled the interactions between the two. Abraham's infatuation with the princess was in fact a more believable plot line. <br/><br/>I also found much of the movie to be strangely ignorant of obvious answers. Remember when you know the killers in the closet of some B movie and you are trying to coach the star to help them avoid the obvious pitfall of opening the closet door where he will inevitably be attacked? Well there are quite a afew of these moment here. There were however some great one liners... but there just was not the same chemistry and pace that made the first installment a smashing success!<br/><br/>Go see it... but consider going to the bargain matinée!"

","...where have I seen that one before? Oh, right: It's a cut scene from the game Warcraft 3 For those who don't know the game: The king's son - now with white, long hair and pales skin - marches through a rain of petals to the throne and stabs his father.<br/><br/>Strike you as familiar? (Youtube: ""Warcraft 3 Arthas Revenge"")<br/><br/>That obvious ripoff aside. The movie was a huge disappointment. Besides the main characters (of which only Ron Perlman seemed to do a god job of acting) it was muppets on steroids. Where the first movie put the budget into only two or three (well animated) monsters this one just gave you guys dressed up in fancy costumes and CGI creatures that were, well, not very striking to look at. Neither the tooth fairies, not Wink, nor the golden army held the dread that Samael or the Ogdru Jahad had (why abandon that storyline? Those elder gods would have been solid story-telling gold!)<br/><br/>Then there's the fact that the first movie established that ordinary people didn't know about the presence of these fantasy creatures. But in this one there are so many all over the place that it makes the entire premise unbelievable.<br/><br/>Suspense was non-existent. From the point on where the link between the twins was established the ending couldn't have been more obvious. <br/><br/>As for Hellboy himself - he seems kind of superfluous for the second half of the movie. He's not even the hero here, nor does he face any real moral dilemma. In the first movie we empathized with him (nature vs. nurture) but here he's just a thug with a stereotypical troubled relationship.<br/><br/>Still give it 3 stars for at least showing the production value - if only for completely useless scenes."

","Hellboy, a comic book character that isn't as well known as other characters such as Spider-man, Superman, Batman and Wolverine. But in a way it gives Hellboy more credible and let film maker be more creative with the character.<br/><br/>Hellboy was a minor success when it was released in 2004 and there were doubts that a sequel would have been made, especially when Columbia split with Revolution Studios. It was Univerial who came to Hellboy's rescue. This give Guillermo del Toro a charge to make a blockbuster with real imagine, playing on his strenghts.<br/><br/>Hellboy II: the Golden Army starts with the legend of man and the forest creatures led by the elves and their war which resulted in the creation of the Golden Army. The war was ended by King of the Elves making peace, promising Humans the cities and the Elves the forests. But his son, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), is disguised by this and puts himself in self-exile. He promised that he would reclaim his throne and control of the Golden Army, so he can continue the war. Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is still working for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense , and living with Liz (Selma Blair). But they are going through relationship problems. Hellboy had become more insubordinate, seeing that his adopted father had been killed and during a mission in New York City he makes such he is well known to the public. A new head of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense is appointed, Johann Krauss (Seth MacFarlane). He is able to lead the investigation which brings the team into conflict with Prince Nuada, having to protect his sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) and the last piece of the crown that can control the Golden Army.<br/><br/>Like any good sequel Hellboy follows up on the first film nicely, playing on its strenght and getting rid of the weaknesses. Hellboy is an action-comedy and is very good on both fronts.Johann Krauss is a great comedic creation for the film, with Seth MacFarlane showing his has skills beyond Family Guy. Ron Perlman is perfect as Hellboy and Luke Goss was good as the villain. It's good to see Doug Jones is more then just a body for creatures and this time he was the voice for Abe. He was very good in the role and even sounded a bit like David Hyde Pierce at times. Hellboy II shows Del Toro's skill for both action and for creating wonderful creatures such as the tooth fairies to the troll market. Hellboy II was really an advert to show that he could do the Hobbit and seeing this film I am a bit more confident that he can carry on Peter Jackson's brilliant work. Like any good film there is reason behind why a villain does what he does in film, and Prince Nuada is no exception. He is a power hungry character, but is still fighting for some sort of noble intention. To free his race. The film is surreal, but this is expected with a character that is the son of the devil, and has magical creatures and it does have some messages about identity, acceptance, fate, love and death and the film does play up to those, for the most part.<br/><br/>I missed Rupert Evans as John Myers, I thought he added comedy and a freshness to the first film which was a shame. Hellboy is also a harder sell then the more well-known comic-book characters. This affect the film's box office takings, which was a shame because it was clear a sequel was in mind.<br/><br/>I never read a Hellboy comic, which is a shame, but seeing that it's Creator Mike Mignola helped write the script then surely that has to be a good thing.<br/><br/>A partly fine addition to the year of comic book adaptations of 2008."

It's up to Hellboy and his gang of fellow paranormals to stop him. This film spends much more time in the paranormal underworld than the first film did, and it gives director Guillermo del Toro the freedom to unleash his fierce imagination in conjuring up the beasties that live in that world.

","After seeing the first turd-bomb called Hellboy, I was rather unenthusiastic about this second part. I had not seen any reviews so I came in with no assumptions. It's amazing what can happen when you put the right director in charge of this genre of movie. You can see many of Guillermo del Toro's influences and nuances throughout the whole movie especially with costuming and characters. The CG effects were not gratuitous and blended well with the story and didn't have you doubting the reality of many of the scenes. The story was many times better than the first film and character development has improved much. I hope Guillermo del Toro does a third part if it is ever offered to him."

","Guillermo Del Toro plays the film world as a game of chess. He has his big guns, his noble pieces, he has a few pawns, but he knows what will be mainstream and what will come more from his heart.<br/><br/>It is often said that to own two fluent languages is to be possessed of two souls.<br/><br/>Del Toro exemplifies this. His Spanish-language work is breathtakingly stylistic, but with excellent political and world sentiment.<br/><br/>The visuals are metaphoric as well as stylistic. His mainstream work was viscerally pulled from the world of comic-books and European gore-horror as well as evident influences of the work of Brian Froud, Jim Henson's fantasy movies and the work of Lewis Carroll's chief illustrator. Moebius,. the inspiration for many of the uniquely stylised characters in the 'Star Wars' movies, was influential also.<br/><br/>'Hellboy 2' marries the comic book viscera, lovingly regurgitated references to creature-features such as 'Gremlins 1 & 2', Harryhausen movies, not to mention 'Labyrinth' and 'The Dark Crystal'.<br/><br/>In the casting of former Brit pop star Matt Goss as the elven prince Nuada, for example, there are echoes of legendary British rock star David Bowie essaying the role of Jareth, the goblin king, in Hensosn's 'Labyrinth'.<br/><br/>'Hellboy' himself is clearly a labour of love for Ron Perlman and Del Toro and is sympathetic - even in the stepping-stone plot.<br/><br/>Plot, however, is of little note when these kinds of sumptuous visuals are on display, proving Guillermo, possibly with inspiration from Mike Mignola, has a visual style as recognisable as Tim Burton's."

"filipemanuelneto","3","0","0","8 June 2020"," Great look, and superb make-up work, but that's it.
","This film is the long-awaited sequel to ""Hellboy"", based on a comic and made in the wake of the fashion of comic-based films that has been a trend in the movies. The film continues the story of the son of Lucifer who came to live among us and defends humans from the dangers of the supernatural world. In this film, he is eager to feel recognized for his efforts, but his work and his very existence remain secret. However, he will have to prevent a war between humans and beings from the supernatural world, who want to control the legendary Golden Army.<br/><br/>The script is the weakness of this film. To begin with, the story told is so imaginative that it becomes absurd and difficult to swallow. There are several notable holes in the plot, which can be easily shattered if you think about it. The usual clichés in adventure blockbuster are quite evident as well. But even if we are willing to accept the story told as it is, there is a void of content behind all the visual style of Del Toro and all the CGI that millions of Hollywood can afford.<br/><br/>The cast is good, much of it was inherited from the first film and does its job without blemish. Perlman is the highlight thanks to his talent and his chameleonic ability to transform himself into whatever he wants, film after film. The problem is that he brings little new to his character here, limiting himself to recycling the work done in the first film. Selma Blair has gained more visibility than she previously had and has done a positive job, especially when she plays with Perlman. Anna Walton is good enough but she doesn't have the space to do much. Doug Jones is a good joker able to do almost anything competently. John Alexander did a good performance too. On the other hand, Luke Goss is a villain who neither scares nor intimidates and Jeffrey Tambor has little to add to the film's positive. Finally, John Hurt's interesting cameo of honor.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is superb. In fact, Del Toro is a master at loading his films with a unique and striking visual style. Personally, I highlight a cinematography that uses contrast, light and shadow, intense colors and urban landscapes, and the very careful characterization of supernatural characters. In fact, the film was even nominated for the Oscar for Best Characterization, which is quite fair. The sets and costumes, as well as the choice of filming locations, are not far behind. The visual, special and sound effects are superb, and the soundtrack is discreet, but contains an excellent version of the song ""Can't Smile Without You"". It is really a pity that the script did not follow all this technical quality."

"Cineanalyst","4","0","0","8 October 2019"," Howdy Doody Time
","Added to the clockwork motif from the first Hellboy movie, for this sequel, is puppetry. This is established early on with a flashback of young Hellboy being a fan of ""Howdy Doody"" on TV (a puppet show that also featured a clock in its opening) and hearing a bedtime story from his father that is visualized as a puppet show about the Golden Army, which are magical militaristic puppets to their master. Writer-Director's Guillermo del Toro's admitted fetishizing of objects seems to even extend to the supernatural creatures here. The troll market, reminiscent of the cantina scene in ""Star Wars"" (1977), may be the best example of this, with a multitude of monstrous creatures serving only as objects of curiosity. The irony is that the story concerns Hellboy and company being ostracized from human society. In a sense, they're objectified for their appearances.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie doesn't follow through very far with this thread and, instead, mostly focuses on the romantic coupling of the ""freaks."" Moreover, the X-Men movie series had already better-developed the theme, as it had better incorporated Nazis into the same framework as opposed to the Indian-Jones-type nonsense of ""Hellboy"" (2004). Even the quick glances here of Hellboy's TV showing Universal's classic monster movies such as ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935) and ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954) come off as lazy shorthand to latch onto what other films followed through on. Otherwise, ""Hellboy II"" wastes time setting up another sequel that, as of over a decade since (and a reboot, to boot), has never materialized. There's no other reason, but to setup a subsequent movie, for the sequence involving and leading up to the encounter with the Angel of Death. Additionally, again, as in the first movie, there's a sword-swirling baddie, with all of the silly swoosh-and-whoosh sounds effects. There's also some other twirling about, some slow-motion action, and this sequel seems especially fond of characters sliding backwards on their feet during fight scenes. On the other hand, Hellboy and the merman drunkenly singing is a nice change of pace from the usual clockwork of this superhero franchise, and the creepy tooth fairies were rather effective at making me feel itchy."

A problem i have is that is somewhat comedic and there is a lot of jokes so when the serious stuff happens its hard to take it serious plus it was kind of cringey to watch with my parents but they still laughed at the funny parts. I mean im not really complaining that bad i mean i could still handle it and im not saying i hate it. It felt very incomplete like a puzzle with a few missing pieces to it.

","'Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008)' is pretty much just more of the same. Despite being no better or worse in terms of quality, it does expand upon the world of the first in a fairly satisfying way, not by piling on excess lore but by spending a bit more of its time and its seemingly larger budget on a plethora of creature designs. It's not just Perlman and Jones who are caked, pretty much head to toe, in make-up this time; there are only two main players who aren't, to some degree, painted a pasty colour or plastered with impressive prosthetics. This goes a long way in making the supernatural side of things seem more tangible. Plus, most of the designs are satisfyingly creative and unmistakably 'Del Toro'. It does, however, make the movie seem a little bit 'Men In Black (1997)', with long shots featuring background agents wrangling oddly-shaped demons and a market scene with a variety of entities who all have their own little throwaway quirks. It sometimes feels a little bit like the film wants to focus on these difficult-to-create but often quite irrelevant moments more than tell a tight tale, which is understandable but ultimately detrimental. It's not a huge issue but you do start to notice the length of time spent on characters with little to do, really, other than look cool. In general, though, the structure and, even, pacing is improved upon from the first, mainly because the audience's surrogate character, Myers, is now missing. This means that the majority of the time can be spent on Hellboy himself, with the left-over space usually being dedicated either to the two other members of his team - both of whom thankfully get beefier roles - or to the villain - who is yet another improvement. The story itself plays a bit more with Hellboy's desire to be accepted by humanity, and whether or not their acceptance is even necessary. It's a nice idea even if it isn't capitalised on fully, with most of the movie playing out like more standard fantasy-action fare. The action scenes are spruced up a bit, making use of subtle - but noticeable - speed-ramping and generally tighter choreography for a faster feel. This style does sometimes seems at odds with our quite clumsy hero, especially since he's often competing with trained martial-artists at full speed, but the piece makes sure to pepper in the occasional moment of brute force to balance things out. Overall, the picture is an entertaining one. Of course, it isn't without its issues and, like its predecessor, it's only truly engaging to a certain degree. It feels more like a 2004 superhero film than a 2008 one but it still manages to balance its character and action rather well, crafting a visually-creative and predominantly practical world in the process. 6/10"

","I think I liked this movie better than the original. It had better character development and I like how some of the ancillary characters got their share of screen time to complement Hellboy (Ron Perlman) in his quest to defeat Prince Nuada Silverlance and his Golden Army. The only one I didn't care for was Johann Klauss (James Dodd); somehow he rubbed me the wrong way, which is what an ectoplasmic researcher can do sometimes. Nuada himself came across as something of a Johnny or Edgar Winter knock-off (in their younger days), and made for a formidable foe for Hellboy and the gang. Sometimes it's the little things that intrigue me in a film, and in this one, Hellboy swigs a fair share of Tecate Beer in any number of scenes, and I had to wonder what impact it had on sales after the release of the picture. Even if minimal, at least it got him and Abe Sapien/Fishstick (Doug Jones) singing a Barry Manilow song from way back. As a comic book super-hero, Hellboy is a pretty cool character, and the film has enough humor amid the chaos to make it worth your while."

","Those nasty Nazis only tried to resurrect a demon to help them win WWII! Lucky we - the Allies - put a stop to that, but figured the demon in question was only a nipper, so we might as well keep him and get him to help us out instead! So goes the basic plot of 'Hellboy' - a superhero movie that came along sort of before this major superhero trend became so popular.<br/><br/>Despite not everyone clamouring to see it (let's face it... the promotional posters of a red demon sporting an oversize claw and pistol hardly made it as 'family-friendly' as 'Spiderman!'), but it certain did well enough to deserve a sequel.<br/><br/>The titular 'Hellboy' is played by (self-confessed) 'grumpy old man' Ron Perlman whose natural (grumpy) charisma shines through and brings this reluctant anti-hero to life. Familiar faces from the first outing also return to help out our demonic saviour including Selma Blair, Doug Jones and John Hurt and, although they all play their roles well, it's Perlman whose big red face steals every scene. <br/><br/>So, Hellboy goes about his 'normal' business of saving us humans from those things that go bump in the night and there's as much action and hideous monsters as you may expect. However, before you write it off completely as just another action movie, it's worth mentioning that visionary director Guillermo del Toro is at the helm and his natural flair for visuals shines through and brings the world to life.<br/><br/>Of course there are plenty of computer-generated special effects, but there's also more 'practical' effects on show here (most likely del Toro's influence, based on his previous body of work) and it's nice to see that models, masks and sets can still be used to great and very effective use when building a fantastical world like this.<br/><br/>Creator of 'Family Guy' Seth Macfarlane pops up for some moments of levity (or rather his voice does) as a friendly German spook whose misty form can inhabit various metal bodies, but if the film has a weakness then it's something that the Marvel films would later suffer from - the villain. We have Luke Goss thrown in there as the new baddie - an elf with a grudge against humanity. Yes, he looks suitably evil and is pretty deadly, but he feels a little 'generic' when compared to everything else around him that's so much above average.<br/><br/>'Hellboy 2' is certainly worth a watch, whether you're into superhero films or not. It's just a shame that del Toro and Perlman never got the third instalment they were so desperately pushing for. I hear there's a 'reboot' on the horizon. I'm sure it will be okay, but it's going to have to be VERY okay to beat either of the existing 'Hellboy' movies."

I guess I have trouble telling those two apart. I admit that some of this film is hokey, but it's beautiful to look at, it doesn't really matter. It can be hard getting into a brand new franchise. The best part of this movie is how absolutely gorgeous it looks.<br/><br/>The visuals and special effects are incredible. There are always new and abstract characters being introduced with all these unique designs. The fight scenes are all epic and wonderfully creative. There's just always some new wonderfully designed creature just appearing right around the corner in this movie. It of course helps that the main character is very enjoyable. I actually do get the relationships these characters have, even if there's not that much screen time devoted to it. It was made by the director of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and it's really easy to tell with the design. This film lacks that movie's emotion, but is still a lot of fun. ***1/2"

","Overall an enjoyable movie, though not as good as the first one and a bit more far fetched (like a demon from another dimension who likes cats and candy isn't already far fetched enough). Guillermo Del Toro directed so you know it's action packed and Ron Perlman was born to play the title role. It has an almost Tolkien-esque backstory of elves and goblins and a war with the world of men, but that's about all that was Tolkien-esque. I definitely thought it was lacking without the agent from the previous film, and I did not care for the voice actor change in Abe Sapein, but that's more of a consistency thing than a cut on the film. Worth seeing if you liked the first one."
"blackburnj-1","8","0","0","5 January 2009"," Guillermo's done it again
","Guillermo del Toro's first Hellboy film was a little bit of a damp squib. This, from the man who would, two years later, direct the visionary, gripping and inventive ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was a disappointment, even though it seemed to be part of the man. He suggested that his cinematic life was split in two, between films ""for himself"" and films ""for Hollywood"".<br/><br/>However, with ""Hellboy II"", del Toro claims that this split is no more and that he has benefited from less interference. In short, he says he is happy to ""own"" this film. This is a cause for rejoicing as del Toro, one of the real treasures of modern cinema, can be trusted to be left to his own devices and, here, he creates a really entertaining, popcorn, blockbuster which is everything that ""Indy IV"" wasn't.<br/><br/>It has del Toro's characteristic invention and style. From the opening sequence (animated mannequins acting out the backstory) through to the grand finale, this is as visually lavish as ""Pan's Labyrinth"". The extended Troll Market sequence is a particular highlight.<br/><br/>The film also has a fair dash of del Toro's wit. Anyone who has seen or heard an interview with him will be aware that he has a cheeky, mischievous and childlike sense of humour which is delightful to listen to. With the impeccable timing of Ron Perlman (who delivers another excellent performance) at his service, he injects Hellboy with some no nonsense humour and conjures numerous amusing scenes and characters to support him.<br/><br/>It may not be to everybody's taste (one of the funniest lines in the film is ""I'm not a baby. I'm a tuma."") but there is a lot to enjoy. Johann Krauss, a new addition to the cast of characters, fits in with this, whilst Abe Sapien (Doug Jones continues his superb work with del Toro here) and Hellboy share a splendid scene involving two drunk paranormal beings and Barry Manilow.<br/><br/>But, del Toro doesn't allow the film to become simple. The central plot features a villain who is in fact in the right (whether this justifies the proposed use of the eponymous army is another matter). Hellboy, now in the public eye, faces fascination and rejection from the humans and the villain is keen to exploit this. It is apparent that, like ""The Dark Knight"", this is a subversive blockbuster which is, in fact, a character piece dressed up as an action film.<br/><br/>All of which makes for great cinema. The film is never boring, always entertaining and a complete experience. This is superior entertainment and a true cinematic experience. It seems that, unhindered, del Toro is a joy. Let us hope that this form carries through to ""The Hobbit"".<br/><br/>4 stars out of 5"

The voices annoyed me the most the fake put on accents were so unnatural. It was painful to hear them. I could spend some time watching the film again and dissect what was so bad about it but the then I would have to watch it again and I was bored watching it the first time.

I am a chick, but I went to the midnight release of Hellboy II for A*C*T*I*O*N!!! If I wanted romance, I would have gone to see Sex in the City, or some crap like that....<br/><br/>Worth seeing in the movie theater, but I'm kinda bummed I stayed up late to see this one at the midnights!! The creatures are really, really cool but woulda liked to have seen Anung un Rama kick some more tail in this one.<br/><br/>Walking out of the theater (it was shown on three screens at our theater, only sold about 40% of capacity) it seemed like most people were of the same opinion.....meh."

","I seen this movie last weekend and can't stop thinking about it. I liked the first Hellboy and Hellboy II exceeds my expectations. I am seriously thinking about going back to see it again.<br/><br/>This movie is funny and full of action. Great one-liners from Hellboy himself and has fantastic fight scenes.<br/><br/>The movie also shows how Liz and Hellboy are truly a couple with issues that need to be worked out but through it all, they remain in love and each would do anything for the other. But is not a mushy love story by any means.<br/><br/>Go and see this movie. It was awesome!<br/><br/>And I hope there will be another Hellboy movie to continue the saga of Hellboy, Liz, Abe, and Johan!!!"
"woodjj","10","3","8","18 July 2008"," An Underrated Work of Art
","This movie is not for everybody apparently, but it was definitely for me. I give it a 10, not because it is a masterpiece, but because it is close enough that I decided to be kind and round up instead of down. The thing that trips people about this movie I believe is that they don't know what to expect to take from the movie, even afterwards. Is it a comedy, is it a serious drama, is it a superhero flick? Is it Pan's Labrynth meets LOTR meets MIB? The truth is, it's a little bit of everything, which means everybody can take something from this film, as long as you can stand the main character being a red, beer-drinking, demon and his sidekick a clumsy, goofy, brainiac fish-man."
"angre1-1","8","3","8","17 July 2008"," good but not in the way I expected
","This would have been a great movie without Hellboy. This was a compelling story about Prince Nauda and Princess Naula, twin elves that hold the fate of the world in their hands. This whole story could have been easily reworked without ever bringing in Hellboy, and it would have been an instant modern fairy tale classic (kind of redundant).<br/><br/>In Hellboy the first installment, the bad guy (Rasputin, the mad monk) wants to destroy the world. He has no plans for what takes it's place; he merely wants to open the portal between the old gods and the new world, and allow the old gods free reign to destroy and destroy...himself included. It is easy to hate him, and root for Hellboy.<br/><br/>This bad guy, Prince Nauda, though, isn't a bad guy. This is shades of grey. And though Hellboy might have a beef with him, in different times and different places, Hellboy probably would have been his bodyguard (instead of Wink). Sooooo....<br/><br/>I did like this movie. The visuals, as always, were stunning. The story was nice (sadly, a bit predictable), and worth the ticket price. And gosh, who hates Ron Perlman? Nobody, that's who. I would go see it again, but I hear Dark Knight is way cool, too."
"akhilgenx2005","8","3","8","16 July 2008"," Want to watch the 1st one also
","Hollywood is certainly moving in a direction where in a movie, they sure want to have some message regarding environmental issues we are facing today. Wall-E was dead on this point and in Hellboy also you can feel it if you think about the basic story of the movie. The movie is technically very sound, the artwork is great. Another Hollywood trend settling in, a good one, is that the heroes are again becoming cool guys e.g. in Ironman. Hollywood had lost its taste for heroes like Eastwood of The good, the bad and the ugly somewhere but they are in making again. I do not remember any such hero in the last few years, the one whom you feel you can follow or had style of their own. There were Frodos, Potters, Spider Man etc. but neah...Batman has its own character built, lacks the style or something that Ironman has. The closest I can think of is Gandalf from LOTR but the energy level wasn't something we are seeing this summer in the leads. The best part of the movie was when they bring human emotion element into a superhero, all such movies do it at some point in the movie but this one took help of music. I was literally awed at that moment. The camera height, the artwork, the music, I was like...Hollywood has really taken the level of entertainment to some height but it all looked fun to watch..again.. because of the body language, the style of Hellboy. Watch it!"
"jon.h.ochiai","8","3","8","15 July 2008"," Can't smile without you...
","My bud Lauren, asked me if ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" was worth seeing. I told him where else would you see Hellboy (Ron Perlman)hulking red monster guy, and Abe Sapien (Doug Jones)slender amphibian guy both drunk on beer and singing Barry Manilow's ""Can't Smile Without You""one of the greatest love songs of the Twentieth Century. You've got to acknowledge Director and Writer Guillermo del Toro for his full throttle, outrageous, and stylishly weird ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"". These further adventures of Red (Hellboy) are based on Mike Mignola's comic book. Ron Perlman reprising Hellboy is awesome. He has the right balance of gruff smart ass and reluctant superhero down. Hellboy is a charismatic, wisecracking, and muscled out hero. It has been 5 years since we last saw Red: we find that his relationship with the love of his life Liz (strong and quirky Selma Blair) maybe down for the count. Liz bares a secret, she is not sure she should disclose to Hellboy.<br/><br/>However, this is the least of their worries. Two pieces to the legendary triad have been usurped by the powerful Prince Nuada (noble and strong Luke Goss), the white maned martial arts blade wielding warrior. The triad is the dismantled crown of King BalorNuada's father. The one who possesses the Crown, commands The Golden Army, the most deadly soldiers in the world. The Crown was dismantled in the truce between the humans and the ""immortals"". What these fantastical beings are is a little confusing, if not completely nebulous. Oh, well this may become clearer on a repeat viewingor not. Prince Nuada needs to recover the third piece. The secret to the whereabouts may lie with his twin sister Princess Nuala (gentle and strangely beautiful Anna Walton).<br/><br/>Seeking to stop Nuada are Hellboy, Liz, Abe, who embody the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, the shadow organization which specializes in defeating the creepy and fantastical. Headed by Tom Manning (hysterical Jeffrey Tambor), the Bureau is in dire need of a public relations makeover. Enter Johann Krauss (Seth MacFarlane), a German accented protoplasmic vapor encased in a retro diving suit. There is logic somewhere in this thread-- somewhere. Del Toro masterfully corners the market on the weird.<br/><br/>The brilliant and mannered Abe (excellent Doug Jones) researches the mythology of The Golden Army, and eventually finds himself in love with Nuala (Walton). Hence, we have the drunken Manilow singing display. Prince Nuada is perhaps the unbeatable warrior. Is Hellboy a match for the great Prince? Can Hellboy stop The Golden Army, and still restore his relationship with Liz (Blair)? Well, you just have to watch the movie. Before the dramatic battle between Red and Nuada, Red says with bravado and disgust, ""I won't kill him. I'm gonna kick his ass!"" The final conflict is visually spectacular. Like all the action and visuals in ""Hellboy II"", they are exquisitely executed just over the top. ""Hellboy II"" is perfect stylish and spirited camp. What makes it all work is that Ron Perlman makes you root for Hellboy. ""Hellboy II"" is not the greatest movie of the year with its confusing narrative elements and blazing pace. However, it is one of the more enjoyable escapes of the summer. Sit back and enjoy the ride."

","Excellent companion to the first Hellboy picture. Great story, quirky characters, and amazing visual effects garner this movie a perfect score. The troll market is one of the most creative sequences in film, and is filled with some of the most creative characters this side of the Mos Eisley Cantina. Ron Perlman is expertly cast, as is Doug Jones and Selma Blair. Many new character additions are added to t this sequel and all of them are noteworthy, but the most notable new addition to the cast is that of Johann Kraussan ectoplasmic spirit encased in an inflatable suit, voiced by the talented Seth Mcfarlene, who is most known for the creation of the hit TV cartoon Family Guy."
"jaredmobarak","7","3","8","14 July 2008"," Which Holocaust shall be chosen?  Hellboy 2: The Golden Army
","Guillermo del Toro goes behind the camera again to continue the saga of everyone's favorite demon on Earth, working for the government to fight evil, in Hellboy 2: The Golden Army. Having already worked on a sequel in his career with Blade II, I had high hopes for this work to improve upon the solid first installment. Being that he was the second director in as many films for that vampire series, he was able to come in with a fresh eye. Here, however, he may be too close to the material and thus been subjected to the sophomore curse of trying to be bigger and better, yet only making it stuffed with fluff rather anything with increasing value. By no means is the movie unentertaining or enjoyable, on the contrary it is a good action flick. My problems lie with the fact that del Toro decided to leave behind the simplicity of tone and plot that worked so well in the first. Instead he has brought to screen a bloated, highly comedic, and much lighter entry to the series. The transitions between laughs and borderline melodramatic moments are too abrupt and confusing without any time to recover from one before going to the other. With a few cringe-inducing scenes evened out by some stellar effects, creatures, and choreographed fights, Hellboy 2 ends up being a mixed bag whose whole isn't consistent enough to allow us to forget those times when it does derail.<br/><br/>While not as bad as Spider-man 3, I can't help but think of comparing the two. The overly hammy nature of the two are somewhat similar with a scene here with Abe and Hellboy singing Barry Manilow while drinking Tecate recalling the horrid emo Peter Parker jazzing it up downtown in Spidey. What worked in the first film was the subtle infusion of wit to counteract the dark nature of the actual storyline. In the sequel, the comedy actually takes center stage during the first two-thirds of the duration. Ron Perlman plays it up wonderfully, but it just became overkill for me. Trying to fit in as many one-liners as possible, the jabs started to take away from the story being told. Every time something important seems to be explained, it gets turned on its head with a laugh, cute at first, but annoyingly counterproductive after numerous instances.<br/><br/>I understand the fact that this is Hellboy trying to come out to the world, trying to become a celebrity and get the credit he feels he deserves. With that aspect he of course needs to play to the cameras and the rockstar sensibility they bring. In my opinion, they just took it too far, especially the Jeffrey Tambor role of Manning, the head of the government operation. He has been turned into a whiner and loses any respect he had from the first movie. I truly believe this is due to the fact that the filmmakers have decided to inject as much as they can into the film. There is just too much Tambor, watering down what works about his character and making him into a prop to be played with by Hellboy. This is not the only piece of the puzzle that has been given exponentially increased screen time. The sheer number of creatures is mind-boggling. Between the scene in the Troll Marketvery reminiscent of the Mos Eisley spaceport on Tatooine in Star Wars: A New Hopeand just the random baddies thrown in throughout, we are assaulted by monsters and costumes at every turn. Don't get me wrong, the effects work is impeccable and some of the races top-notch, it is just once again overkill. The elves are fantastically constructed, Johann Krauss's ectoplasmic self is entertaining, and The Angel of Death is the coolest thing about the entire film. Did we need the tumor-man, or cat-eating troll, or even the forest God? Not really. The first two could have been anything and the giant is he a villain or is he an endangered species of worldly creation could have been any big faceless monster and still have worked.<br/><br/>One thing that was grown from the previous installment is the role of Abe Sapien, played once more by the great Doug Jones, (only this time he is allowed to use his own voice rather than a redub from David Hyde Pierce). One the best characters from the first, his increased screen time is welcome despite the hitches into lovey-dovey drivel and badly orchestrated ""drunk"" sequence."" His extension might be at the demise of Selma Blair's role, which not only has been pushed to the background fro much of the film, but while being given a cool new fire ""suit"" loses the very awesome blue inferno from part one.<br/><br/>However, what may be lacking in dramatic weight and darkness is compensated with amazing fight scenes. One thing this once has going for it are moments of brilliance on the battlefields. Luke Goss steals the show with his acrobatics and really steps up in the final fight versus Hellboy. He shows what made him so perfect as the main villain in Blade II and why del Toro decided to bring him on board to recapture that magic. It is the hand-to-hand combat that dazzles and I wish there was more of it to showcase. Even when the titular Golden Army arrives, they fight in a human-like way with arms and legs stabbing with swords. Unfortunately, moreso than not, we are treated with battles of destructions, roads and walls being blown apart by creatures and gunfire, showing how much the American public loves to see explosions. I myself would rather partake in the amazing dance-like work of true professionals doing it all without computer help. Del Toro got a lot right here, but also fell victim to the Hollywood machine, getting a little too big than necessary, watering down the final result."
"ihatespike","10","3","8","12 July 2008"," This is a warning; I'm already a fan.
","Yup I saw it opening day. If you're not already into Hellboy and just want someone to summarize this then here goes; you know those movies of the fantasy genre that could be really awesome but end up falling flat? This movie and the one before it got the formula right. It's got that goofy humor in it but it isn't unbearable or out of character, it has more action than the last but it doesn't bog down the story and it doesn't make you dizzy, in fact the choreography is beautiful without being obsessed with style (a fine line in my opinion) and it really does take you to that realm of Guillermo/Mignola creativity that I love. The CGI doesn't jump into your face and scream ""I'm FAKE"" in fact the thought never crossed my mind (bravo CG team). I also feel the need to mention that you care about the characters. Maybe it's just me but I'm seeing less and less of that in film these days; I think movie makers are starting to assume their audiences will just side with the protagonist because they said so but the empathy felt towards the inhuman characters especially (even the less important ones) is appreciated. I'm excited to see where this series takes us next. In the mean time I hope you take my recommendation and enjoy yourself."

"matrix_swatcat","3","4","13","13 July 2008"," Hellboy 2
","*************************MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!************************** <br/><br/>I was extremely disappointed with this movie. In a nutshell it is far from deserving a rating of anything above 7. I guess I found it bad because I felt that Hellboy 2 copied many movies. To list: Blue is a bad replica of C3PO from star wars.<br/><br/>The troll world is a replica of Tatooine gone bad from star wars.<br/><br/>Hellboy's line ""That was my last cigar now you've pis**d me off"" or something is directly from Wolverine who has used that line countless times throughout the wolverine comics. It is a well known wolverine trademark which has been ripped here.<br/><br/>The prince is very similair to Darth Maul from star wars, having his extendable sword which turns into a staff. Even the scene when the stick extends into a staff is almost identical to a scene of darth maul in star wars. I found it unoriginal.<br/><br/>The robot guy reminded me of a cheap try at vader.<br/><br/>The main reason why i disliked it was since as a star wars fan, I felt they copied some key scenes and it wasn't original. The resemblance is sort of faint but its there nevertheless.<br/><br/>The large moving rock opening to the golden army when moving looked like a bad sandman from spiderman.<br/><br/>The scene when the golden army was awakened, the tavern and setting with the robot like things looked very similair to the epic end battle in the matrix revolution in zion. The tavern had a very strong sort of a zion feel to it.<br/><br/>The script was corny in some instances and effects were great on the whole however things were noticeably flawed and looked a little fake in other instances. Jokes were alright at most points but very lame in quite a few instances.<br/><br/>Acting was noticeably bad and plastic in only a few instances but main characters did a good job, especially hellboy.<br/><br/>Some parts were funny such as the singing which added a warm touch to the characters. Some fight scenes were also sort of original. The prince other than some of his moves being copied from darth maul, was VERY entertaining and worth waiting for between other scenes.<br/><br/>To finish, the story's ending didn't make any sense. Had the princess not had the will to live in the first place, should she not have killed herself LONG BEFORE THE END to kill the prince, saving the many lives which the prince took including her own fathers?!?!! A far better job could have been done. It was however better than the first movie but still very very far from being a hit movie and any success is due to the trailer being good. Had it been more original, I may have liked it more. Hopefully IF there is a third, they will give hellboy a better name than it is given now."
"PWNYCNY","2","3","9","19 July 2008"," Ugh! First rate junk,
","What a dumb movie. Real junk. Hollywood at its glorious worst as comic-book characters get comic-book treatment. What else would one expect? Appealing to the lowest-common-denominator is alive and well in this movie. The plot is dumb, the acting plodding, the special effects not so special (and there's lots of them too), and the main character is a joke. Just because the main character is taken from a comic-book doesn't mean he can't be given some dignity. The good vs. evil conflict is weak, the good guys are clueless, the bad guys are travesties. Why not have Hellboy rescue inmates from a concentration camp or help defend innocent defenseless people who are victims of violence? This movie once again proves that when given the chance Hollywood will churn out mediocrity from that creative potboiler that spews out the garbage that's supposed to pass for entertainment. In addition, this movie is as long as its mediocre and to watch this movie without nodding off is a challenge. And please, what's with the opening monologue? Don't tell a story, show it! It's a movie not a play."
"AndrewLoynd15","5","3","9","15 July 2008"," Action replaced by chick flick moments?
","So there I was sitting in the movie theater after weeks of amazing trailers for what was to be one of the great sequels of this summer. Hellboy was back, and looking more badass than ever with what appeared to be and even darker look. And as soon as the movie started I knew I had been had. The film starts off with a big toothed, awkwardly pre-pubescent hellboy listening to a story about the golden army from Professor Broom. What was the only thing worse than seeing hellboy in such a sad state, watching what could have been a cool intro with the senseless killing performed by giant golden monsters done in the form of puppets. Now granted it had its reason, but was still quite pitiful. The movie takes off where the last left off by making you aware immediately that not only has Agent Myers been cut from this film but Abe's voice is now played by a different actor, and an inferior one at that. You are also introduced by a character who joins the film as further, yet unnecessary comic relief, voiced by Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy and American Dad) basically performing the voice he already does for the German goldfish on his show American Dad likely named Krauss. Clearly not meant to be taken seriously, although I expect many people felt he was supposed to be, he was not poorly acted for what he was. The film slowly gets worse and worse as you watch Hellboy and Liz struggle through their new relationship woes and watch as Abe falls for an elven princess. Amazing how you can take a relatively good action movie and turn it into a movie made for the sex in the city and the Wall-E crowds. Fortunatly there were some redeeming comedy moments and solid action. Not enough to pull this movie out of the mud for me. The only upside to this film was seeing that it was left open for a trilogy which will hopefully make up for the sad sack that was this film. My advice: wait till its on DVD or TV, don't bother throwing your money away on a film that is probably not at all what you're looking for."

"beatnick49","9","2","5","31 August 2008"," Fantastic, Brilliant, A vanguard for the not so tall dark and handsome only one quam
","I saw an advance screening of this four days ago and I was not disappointed. This movie has everything that made the first one great, the characters and the good story. It also has some nice welcome additions such as influence from Pan's Labyrinth, and a new character.<br/><br/>The great thing about Hellboy: The Golden Army and its prequel, is the characters. These are characters who are not tall dark and handsome, completely flawless, but are in fact quite ""human"" (despite their abilities) while performing outstanding feats. They are also so sympathetic. The movie also features character development. Hellboy is not tall dark and handsome, but fat, red, bald, and has a stylised beard. He likes having beer, cigars, and (in the prequel anyway) working out. More importantly, he like cats, in most movies the heroes are dog lovers but Hellboy likes cats, a major pluss in my books. Even though he is the strongman of the team, he is resourceful, skilled and innovative. In a lot of movies the tough guys will treat the nerds as a joke, but Hellboy is a close friend and confidante to Abe, and love Lisa to the extent that he will give up his cats for her. Liz is also a great character, she is not slim, long haired and big busted, outgoing, but rather she has an oddball hair style, is toned, her bust size is of no concern in the movie, and will lash out if provoked. She is not a damsel in distress, with Hellboy needing her help in both movies. She is also a capable fighter with firearms. Abe, while being the nerd of the group is not a typical nine gram weakling with buck teeth, but is well spoken, able to use a gun, and functions as survellaince and forensics for the team. Johann starts off as the streotypical by the book yes man, but later turns into a character ready to break the rules for his close friends, and capable of outwitting Hellboy.<br/><br/>A great feature of this movie is the character development. Abe show that he too is overcome with love for a woman and is unable to express his feelings, and tries singing pop love songs to woo her. Hellboy and Liz go from a loving couple, to a bickering couple (although the argument does interfere in their work, and Liz defend him from a hostile crowd different from other movies with bickering couples). Johann starts off as a lackey, but turns into a maverick like his team mates. In the end they all put each other first. We also get to see Hellboy as a boy, living as a typical kid, watching TV shows featuring puppets, believing in and waiting for Santa, having a bed time story read to him, and going to bed with a cowboy gun. I liked that. <br/><br/>All round these are human characters with human concerns, Liz feels uncomfortable telling Hellboy about the baby but tells Abe (their mutual friend), they scuffle of ""their stuff"", Hellboy likes to shave and keep beer in his locker, Hellboy and Johann fight in the locker room, Hellboy and Abe get drunk together and talk about women, and all feel the pangs of love.<br/><br/>What is also good, is that Guillermo takes influence from his own move Pan's Labyrinth and places them here. It works well, blending fairy tales and the occult.<br/><br/>A good scene is while Hellboys father is reading the story, Hellboy imagines the human, elfs, dwarfs etc as toys, as kids would. Not epi humans.<br/><br/>My only gripe is that Liz's role was downplayed. Although she does contribute great;y, burning the tooth fairies, making the deal with the angel for hellboys life, melting the crown, and carrying the crown.<br/><br/>A great movie all round. Worth it whether free or paid for."
"pc95","6","2","5","31 August 2008"," Weaker Story/Villains than the Original, doesn't make it to the original's level
","I was pleasantly surprised by the original Hellboy a few years ago, and so I was eager to watch it's sequel hoping for another fun experience. The original was more involving and sharper focused with Human beings and paranormal agents had much better dynamics. However, Hellboy 2: The Golden Army falls a bit short. The overall story seems like conjured from a 3rd grader, lacking any depth. There was a feeble attempt at making the villain half-way noble as well as a stupid gimmicky twin sister and side-romance that bored. None of it was really explained - mostly glossed over escapading from one visual CGI background/character to the next. And the finale scenes were too run-of-the-mill and overlong, with actually the CGI sort of spotty sometimes in the movie. At times the movie felt like it was ripping off from Men in Black and Harry Potter. (Spoilers) There was a semi-interesting new paranormal agent - a German Spectre, and a comical long sequence with beer involving he and Hellboy fighting to help give the movie a pulse. I liked the inventive goggles too seeing the paranormal. Many of the Visuals (spoiler) particularly in the Troll Market were competent and wonderfully grotesque. But the movie needed a better framework, story, and villain - Overall it was somewhat disappointing compared to the original - if not OK. Probably worth a watch if you liked the original - just doesn't break new ground or quite make it as involving."

","After watching the first movie, it had me entertained beyond belief, i was looking forward to the sequel immediately. Now comes along Hellboy 2, and i was enthralled, the previews looked amazing, i thought it was going to be awesome. Some people say that sequels never hold up to viewers expectations, this does not apply to this movie! Hellboy 2 was fantastic, the use of costumes and CGI for the monsters was incredible, one of the directors strong points. Like in Pan's Labyrinth the monsters take on a similar style. If you research this movie you may find little details that are slightly different than the first. (i won't tell you them, just trust me some things are better left not known). Great movie, great, great, great movie. It's Epic! ------------- Go see it... NOW"

","Are movies based upon graphic novels rotting the brains not only of viewers, but of otherwise respected critics? I have no other explanation for Roger Ebert -- the critic for whom I have the highest respect -- giving ""Hellboy II"" 3-1/2 out of 4 stars. I mean, Ebert is a very smart man; one of the few critics capable of appreciating ""Synecdoche, New York"", for crap's sake! How could he be taken in by this cobbled-together tower o' turds? The real problem with so many filmic treatments of graphic novels is that it's an immature subgenre; it doesn't know how seriously to take itself, so it simply throws together seriousness, winking irony and schlock in approximately equal amounts. The original ""Hellboy"" movie succeeded because it never took itself too seriously, and because Ron Perlman's characterization of the title character was likable despite itself. No such luck with ""Hellboy II"", whose star basically phones in his performance with (with one exception) little more than an embarrassingly unlikable and dull routine. (That one exception is not in his favor; it's his mawkish and utterly false sentimentality towards ""Liz Sherman"", his perfunctory love interest. They might as well have subtitled ""Hellboy II"" with ""Will Fatherhood Change Hellboy?"") <br/><br/>But the real flaws of ""Hellboy II"" are in its utter banality. We're given a ""McGuffin"" (Alfred Hitchcock's term for the overarching quandary or goal around which the plot arranges itself) of something to do with an army of 490 robots who can be controlled by someone in possession of a certain crown. OK, fair enough, but the importance of this is related in about 2 minutes of voice-over exposition that lends no gravity whatsoever to the matter. So there's an army of golden robots somewhere? Why should we care? This is a bog-standard ""Oh dear, there's an army of robots that can be used for doing Very Bad Things"" plot device used in stories since the 1920s. Ho-flipping-hum.<br/><br/>And in charge of those robots is one ""Prince Nuada"" (a name straight from Fantasy Films Central Casting) -- a parricide and regicide who nonetheless takes the time to lecture Hellboy about the earth's poor, fragile environment (cliché #2) and ""you're a freak too, why are you helping humans who don't like you?"" (cliché #3) It doesn't help that ""Prince Nuada"", for all of his ass-kicking, uses freakin' EXPANDING SWORDS and SPEARS to do his dirty work (apparently, his supernatural, technologically advanced circumstances are afflicted with the very thing that afflicts so many fantasy films and anime: namely that in the future, swords are the lethal weapon of choice, instead of oh, I don't know -- maybe GUNS?) Worse yet, ""Prince Nuada"" looks and acts EXACTLY like a low-budget ""Interview with the Vampire""-era Tom Cruise. Every scene he's in has to be approached with maximum scenery-chewing, glaring, flouncing and Important Speechifying.<br/><br/>We are given a ""romance"" between Hellboy and ""Liz Sherman"" that could not be less emotionally true, unless your benchmark of relationship verity is ""Friends"". We are given the utterly cretinous Jeffrey Tambor as comic relief, fresh from such fine TV shows as ""Three's Company"" and ""The Ropers"", who manages to suck the tension and credibility out of every scene he's in. Danny Elfman's treacly musical score swells and his strings sob at moments that are supposed to tug our heartstrings, but end up just being laughable. News to the world's superheroes, wanted and unwanted: we don't give a fig about your romantic relationships, your hypothetical fetuses or the lame-ass Barry Manilow song of the '70s that sums up all of your complex feelings towards both. And word to the producers of ""Hellboy II"": the brewers of Tecate called to let you know that they have your $2 million product placement dollars ready to exchange for your souls. Mmmm, Tecate -- delightfully refreshing! <br/><br/>In the process, ""Abe Sapien"" inexplicably (for love, or course!) endangers the lives of everyone on earth because he's infatuated with chickie. Ron Perlman moves his face like he's a plastic surgery disaster. There's a ""fascistic German robot"" (oh, Benicio -- you card!). There's a ""troll market"" that owes so much to the ""cantina"" scene in the original ""Star Wars"" that...well, it's just pathetically derivative. There is endless, ENDLESS CGI. (They should've given ""CGI"" top billing in the credits, ahead of Ron Perlman.) There's a Really Big Nature God freak ripped off directly from Miyazake's ""Mononoke-hime"". There's a THIRD version of The Freak With Eyes Where Eyes Ought Not Be in a Benicio del Toro film. (In del Toro's next film there will be a freak with his eyes in his elbows. In the film after that, they'll be on his scrotum. Just FYI.)<br/><br/>More laughable than any of these is the fact that every single time our heroes are faced with an emergency, they stand around and wait for the worst possible thing to happen BEFORE they actually do anything. A monster is on the loose? Hellboy has his gun locked and loaded, but where's the sense in actually _doing_ anything with it? Instead of simply shooting the monster that is looming over him, Hellboy has to break into a minivan, take out a baby that is in no present danger, climb the side of a building while holding said baby as said monster demolishes the neighborhood, and THEN, at the last minute, shoot the monster. Congratulations, Hellboy! You saved the baby! In the meantime, 73 people were crushed. Brilliant. Frankly, any plot that relies upon heroes waiting until the last minute to do the most obvious, sensible thing, is already running on empty. And running on empty is what ""Hellboy II"" is, from the get-go."

","I sincerely hated Pan's Labyrinth with a hardcore passion. The clichés, the copy/paste story that has been used on every fantasy work from Mythago Wood to episodes of the dead cartoon Chalk Zone, the boring war scenes . . . what about Pan's Labyrinth was there NOT to hate? Likewise, the del Toro produced cliché-in-a-house movie that was The Orphanage made me lose all hope del Toro had any potential.<br/><br/>I've never seen the first Hellboy. This was the first slightly original work I have ever seen from del Toro. Without the insanely boring, pointless scenes that Pan's Labyrinth had, and with much more focused action, Hellboy gave me hope del Toro can use his potential. The man has always has amazing visions and philosophies, but until now I wasn't sure he could use them. Thank God he proved me wrong.<br/><br/>The movie is very far from perfect, and parts were a little too intentionally cheesy for me, but it works. It awes, it has some terror, and has some amazing over-the-top action. It really made me feel the same way I felt with all the old children's fantasy movies like The Dark Crystal and The Never Ending Story, but with a much more mature focus and presentation.<br/><br/>I can now say del Toro has made a movie as great as the way he thinks.<br/><br/>2/10"

","Hellboy 2: The Golden Army was without a doubt one of the better action movies of this summer.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this movie is that the plot was very original and interesting. The movie also did a great job mixing action and drama with humor. <br/><br/>The acting was great and the person playing hellboy did a fantastic job. <br/><br/>The costumes and special effects were also extremely good.<br/><br/>Overall I would definitely recommend this movie as to anyone who is looking for a good superhero flick.

"Aaron1375","10","2","6","17 July 2008"," Hellboy is back and burns even brighter this go around.
","This sequel is an improvement to the first movie, both were good this one better. Of course, for me the main factor in it being better is that there is such a variety of monsters to look at this time. In the previous movie basically all the monsters Hellboy fought were essentially the same creature. Even the last monster he faced was just a bigger version of said creatures. Here you have a ton as this movie looks a bit like Pan's Labyrinth in the underground troll market. Ron Pearlman is still aces as Hellboy, I liked Liz better in this one and Abe Saphien plays a much bigger role as well and is fleshed out a bit more. They take away the Norton character which is fine as they replace him with someone who lets just say fits the team better. The story has a prince elf (at least I think he is an elf) who has been in self exile over the many years searching out pieces of a golden crown so he can gain control of the legendary golden army and once again wage a war on humans. There is an excellent scene involving creatures called tooth fairy's and then Hellboy gets the exposure he has always yearned for. The movie then switches to them trying to find the troll underground market where there is more action as a very big beastie is unleashed to kill Hellboy and then a humorous scene of Hellboy and Abe drinking beer. Then a rousing conclusion as we have a rare comic book movie that has a very good final battle. The humor is good, the action is good most of the movie is very good. I will say the thing between the brother and sister elves that occurred was a bit to telegraphed, however other than that this movie had very few flaws for me."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","6","15 July 2008"," One hell of a fun movie
","Putting things in proper perspective, those who have watched ""Pan Labyrinth"" are fully aware of the visual wonders director Guillermo del Toro is capable of creating. Even those coming to ""Hellboy II"" with the highest expectations, however, will not be disappointed. It's not only sheer beauty, nor is it only painstaking details, but there's also ingenious imagination on which these stunning visuals build.<br/><br/>On plot, characters and mise-en-scene, it doesn't need a film critic to point out the resemblance to Star Wars, a resemblance that reflects more of a conscientious tribute rather than mindless copying. While they do bring to mind C-3PO and Princess Leia, Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) and Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) are characters that have their own unique existence. On the other hand, the twin brother and sister Nuada (Luke Goss), embodiment of good and evil, have a distinct flavour Shakespearean tragedy.<br/><br/>While visuals in clearly the main purpose  there are several scenes that will keep you eyes wide open even if you have not slept for a few nights  there is also wit and humor as well as affecting moments. There is one sequence that is an absolute stroke of ingenuity. During a languid lull between explosive action scenes, our to love-sick heroes are seen (and heard), after consuming God knows how many six-packs, singing along to the background of the sappiest of the sappiest love ballad, Barry Manilow's ""Can't smile without you"".<br/><br/>Ron Perlman's Hellboy is the most lovable comic book hero around today (yes, quite Robert Downey's Iron Man is immensely popular, but I won't describe him as ""lovable""). Strangely, it reminds me of George Kennedy's Joe Patroni in the Airport series. Selma Blair's Liz Sherman is a perfect match, striking good balance between between shining in her own persona but not outshining the central hero.<br/><br/>Fantasy more than Sci-fi, ""Hellboy II"" is one hell of an entertainment that worths re-even if watching, just for the visuals."

Hellboy is a agent of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD) and he's living in New York City. Hellboy tries very hard to make his relationship works with his now wife Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), who has Pyrokinetic Powers. Which Liz doesn't want to tell Hellboy that she's pregnant. Hellboy still lives sloppy at his place and lives care-free in his life.

Since this dark hearted Prince from the Elves thinks that all humans are simply no good and he wants to awakening The Golden Army. These golden unstoppable clockwork soldiers are so superior to humans and they can't be destroyed. But Prince Nuada needs the golden Crown, which it's broken into three pieces to connect them to awakening his dark dream come true. The last piece from the Crown is kept safe from his sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton), which she will do anything to keep it away from her evil brother.

Perlman, who's just great as Hellboy. Like he was in the original and he is perfectly cast as the role. Jones is also great as Abe, which he also plays two different roles in the movie. Jeffery Tambor is back as Agent Tom Manning and John Hurt makes an welcome brief appearance as Hellboy's father figure/Professor Trevor ""Broom"" Bruttenholm in the opening sequence. MacFarlane's talented voice worked nearly steals the show from the cast as the by the book agent, who's often hilarious in the role. There's hardly an dull moment in this much better than expected sequel and del Toro's film-making style has an good eye for strong visual moments with enough imagination to make different types of pictures here. Don't miss it. Screenplay by the director, who also came up with the premise with Mike Mignola (Who created the Comic Book ""Hellboy"". (**** 1/2 out of *****)."

","Went to watch the film at the cinema just now. Picked out the film because other films shown there were either not interesting or because I've seen it already.<br/><br/>I'm not a Hellboy fan, have not read any of the comic, and did not finish watching the first film. So I hope I can give a truly objective review.<br/><br/>This sequel, I believe, picked up from where the first film stopped. Hellboy, now married to Liz was living together. And as in any relationship, there's bound to be good days, bad days, and extremely bad days (I quote Fish's phrase).<br/><br/>The opening starts with young Hellboy, who was about to go to bed and asked his dad (or is it? I suppose it's not his biological dad, though). He asked for a bedtime story, and his dad told him about the Golden Army.<br/><br/>Alright, fast forward to current time. Prince Nuala (the son of the King of Bermootha) crashed an auction house and stole the stuff that belongs to his dad. And it did not stop there. he went on a rampage and let loose his 'pet' to feed on all the people in th auction house.<br/><br/>Alright, not gonna spoil the full story :) In my humble opinion, I think the film's was quite good.The audio was superb, the sword swooshing, the monsters squeaking, the works, it was fantastic. The computer-generated animation was also nicely done. It look almost real! However, I think the film's a tad too long, and younger audience in the cinema lost attention halfway through the film. Other than that, nothing major worth mentioning."

","The only real problem with this movie is that it is a sequel and not an original story. The artistry placed n ever shot is absolutely amazing, where every one else in the industry uses CG this movie uses make up and sculptures. Except for the fast paced action sequences which I can forgive. Everything looks like moving art and Del Torro it seems is single handedly reviving the old art of movie makeup. Everything seems and feels real which i haven't seen in a movie since the early 90's. Very few shots will give you the feeling 'that's CG'. The movie itself is a campy action movie with incredible visual style and a good sense of humor. The story is far more layered than I had ever imagined it would be. It actually provided some depth however subtle it was. Del Torro has proved himself to be a director worth watching and I look forward to another original project like pan's labyrinth because if he was able to make a cheap action sequel into an artistic movie he can do real magic with a real script."

","*MANY SPOILERS AHEAD* <br/><br/>""Hellboy 2 The Golden Army"" is action-packed fun, and in my opinion better than the original. Director Guillermo Del Toro who did ""Pan's Labyrinth"" throws at the audience the old stars we loved (Hellboy, Abe, and Liz). As well as a ton of creatures, who are anything but ordinary. <br/><br/>The story begins when a 10 year old Hellboy being told a story by his adoptive father Trevor Broom. He tells Hellboy that there once was a king named Balor, with a son named Nuada and a daughter named Nuala. The king has a mythical creatures build him an army of 70 mechanical soldiers. All of which are controlled by a gold crown. After a time of warfare, the Golden Army is put to rest and the crown is divided by the fairytale creatures and the human race. Now the prince wants to reclaim their land which was taken by the humans. Such as lands created into ""parking lots"" and ""shopping malls"". <br/><br/>After a piece of the crown is stolen from an auction Hellboy, Liz, and Abe investigate. Soon they are accompanied by the comical and intelligent John Krauss, (Voiced by Seth McFarlane). A Gaseous person inside an old-fashioned Scuba suit with a gas helmet. He has the power to animate and control non-living objects. The heroes battle a swarm of tooth fairies, a 10 foot troll, a giant plant monster, the prince, and the best scene of all The Golden Army. Although some of the action sequences run together, possibly to save time and money. There is never a boring moment. The director also balances the action with a heart too. Abe Sapien falls for Princess Nuala, while Hellboy is struggling to get along with Liz. Abe finds out early in the film that Liz is pregnant, and they hide the truth from Hellboy later on. The love builds up to Hellboy and Abe drinking beer and singing Barry Manilow. A scene that I thought was oddly funny. <br/><br/>This is a fun movie-going experience and the hour and 50 minute running time just flies right by. Go see this movie it's a rare comic book movie that is beautiful to look at. Of course, ""The Dark Knight"" looks better than this, but people who have less patience watching a movie well over two hours long, will find Hellboy 2 a real treat."
"das417","9","2","6","13 July 2008"," Hellboy faces his greatest challenge..... And choice......
","There have been many superheroes Hollywood has chosen to focus on. Batman, Superman, the Incredible Hulk, and even Catwoman have all had films dedicated to their stories and the plots that revolve around them. However, none of these heroes can compare to the conflicts and humor that center directly upon an immature and easily angered red demon who not only loves cats but is also determined to save humanity.<br/><br/>Hellboy (Ron Perlman) has come a long way since his defeat of Rasputin. Though his father, Professor Travis Bruttenholm (John Hurt) is now gone, Hellboy can still count on his team which include the intellectual Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) and Liz Sherman (Selma Blair). Liz has now become his girlfriend (a quirky issue in the last movie) which has brought the usually benefits and problems that such relationships bring no matter the species involved. The BPRD, run with a close leash by director Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor), is still the best option to defeat that which ""bumps in the night"".<br/><br/>What ""bumps in the night"" this time is the Elf Prince Nuada (Luke Goss). Long ago the races of man fought that of the elves and ogres for control of the world. When Prince Nuada's father King Balor (Roy Dotrice) accepts a truce with the human world that banishes the elf race to the shadows of the world, Nuada goes into exile in disgust. What infuriates him further is that his father has at his disposal the Golden Army which is an unbeatable army of mechanical men that nearly crushed humanity during the first war. Why his father would throw away such an advantage is something that Nuada will hold onto for centuries.<br/><br/>The control of the Golden Army lays in the hands of whoever holds the three pieces of the golden crown given to King Balor. While one of the pieces were given to the race of men to hold onto, the centuries have seen it passed down until it ends up in an auction one night in New York. Prince Nuada, returning from exile, sees his chance to claim victory over the humans by claiming the piece of the crown. Holding onto one of the pieces, Nuada knows that he must acquire the other two which are held by his father Balor and his twin sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton).<br/><br/>Hellboy and the BPRD and find themselves facing not only an internal power struggle but also the threat of the Golden Army itself which Prince Nuada is more than willing to use. The addition of Johann Krauss (Seth MacFarlane), an ectoplasmic stickler for the rule book, rounds the team out though of course Hellboy and him will have more than a few clashes over strategy and most of all personality.<br/><br/>Known for his work on Pan's Lybrinth, Guillermo del Toro does not disappoint with his visual and interpretations of the world of Mike Mignola. The secret ogre market of New York, the battles between the BPRD and a swarm of ""tooth"" fairies, and most of all the final confrontation with the Golden Army in the depths of a long forgotten elf city in Ireland, all support Guillermo del Toro's reign of visual rule in the genre of fantasy. Hellboy 2 is the most visual aesthetic comic movie released this year.<br/><br/>There are several personal issues that confront Hellboy that are worth noting. Besides the change between Hellboy and Liz, he wants to be accepted by a public that otherwise only knows hints and rumors (and Youtube as well) that tell of his existence. This is not uncommon for some superheroes but with Hellboy it is more difficult due to his ""evil"" appearance and rough edge. An issue that was only hinted at before in the first movie becomes more apparent now as Hellboy realizes that he won't be fully accepted despite his efforts to save humanity from the forces of evil.<br/><br/>The more important issue though is the destiny that Hellboy will force upon the world. As anyone who is familiar with the graphic novels know, Hellboy will destroy the world. Liz, who faces the choice of choosing Hellboy's life even when facing the reality of his ""destiny"", still decides to save his life. The question will be how her choice will effect not just their relationship but the world. There is also the matter of their children and how that will influence the events that are certain to come.....<br/><br/>Hellboy remains the most intriguing comic character to reach the big screen. Hopefully we will see more of him in the future.<br/><br/>9/10"
"MaximumMadness","9","2","6","12 July 2008"," ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" is a surge of serious fun, with some truly human drama!
","""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" is the fast-paced, no-holds-barred sequel to Guillermo Del Toro's 2004 comic-book film ""Hellboy"", and in every way this follow-up is equal (and even sometimes superior) to the original! <br/><br/>The film opens with a charming scene set on Christmas Eve in 1955. As a young Hellboy waits for Santa Claus to bring him presents, Trevor Broom (played by a returning John Hurt in this delightful cameo), tells him an ancient story. Thousands of years ago, the Elven King Balor commissioned the creation of an indestructible magical army (70 times 70 soldiers) to wage war on the human race. After the war, he was filled with regret over his dreadful actions, and he made a pact with the humans- they would have the cities, while the Elves would keep the forests. His crown, which controlled the army, was split into three pieces, two to be held by the Elves, and one to be held by the humans.<br/><br/>Now, we flash forward to modern times. Prince Nuada (a very creepy Luke Goss), the exiled son of Balor, has grown a deep hatred against humanity. Opposed to their greed (""They have destroyed the planet to create parking lots and shopping malls!""), he plots to reunite the three pieces of the crown, and call forth the magical Golden Army to destroy the humans, and reclaim the Earth.<br/><br/>At the same time, Manning (Jeffrey Tambor at his hilarious best) is trying to keep everything together at the BPRD (Beauro for Paranormal Research and Defense). Things are a little chaotic, and the fact that Hellboy (Ron Perlman playing the role with perfection) and his pyrokinetic girlfriend Liz (the sexy Selma Blair, who does a good job developing her character) are not getting along doesn't help matters much. But before long, HB, Liz and aquatic colleague Abe Sapien (Doug Jones, this time also lending his voice to the character... trust me, it fits in fine) are called on a new mission- to investigate an auction house that was mysteriously attacked, every inside killed.<br/><br/>This is basically the match that starts the fuse... It is in this cool action scene (which involves thousands of miniature ""Tooth Fairy"" creatures that eat calcium in teeth and flesh), that we learn what direction the film will take. First, and most importantly, we learn that Liz has been moody because (much to the un-surprise of the audience) she is pregnant with Hellboy's child. We also get to witness Hellboy and the BPRDs not-so-triumphant reveal to the world for the first time. Quite amusing is Hellboy watching and reacting to himself on the news, including a brief glimpse of a segment on Jimmy Kimmel's show.<br/><br/>From there on in, the film flies like a roller-coaster, as Nuada claims two of the three pieces of the crown, and must track down his twin sister, Nuala, to find the final piece, while Hellboy and the gang search for her at the same time, racing to stop Nuada's devious plot. The film plays with a furious pace, though director Del Toro is able to keep the scenes grounded enough to understand and enjoy. Take for instance, a hectic scene where the gang (along with the ghostly new leader Johann Kraus, voiced by Seth McFarlane) must search through a ""Troll Market"", a massive congregation of mystical creatures under the Brooklyn Bridge. With what seems like dozens of different creatures on screen at once, and ultimately ending in a cool battle between Hellboy, Abe and a giant creature named ""Mr. Wink"", this scene could have fallen to pieces. But del Toro, whose magic has crafted masterpieces such as ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""The Devil's Backbone"", is able to make it flow rather nicely, and keep a level of coherence that might evade other directors.<br/><br/>Also, I would like to say that I enjoyed the role of the characters and their development in this film, when compared to the first film. Not to say I don't love the first film (it is actually one of my favorite movies, period), I just found that the seriousness of the script and the characters sometimes slowed it down. Not enough to annoy me, but just enough to notice. Here, Perlman, Blair, Jones, Tambor and all of the actors keep the film moving along, with massive amounts of zany humor injected by del Toro. At least this film knows enough to not treat itself like an attempt at Oscar gold.<br/><br/>I also admire the villain Nuada in this film much more than I did Rasputin in the original. This time the script (which I should mention was based on a story treatment by del Toro and ""Hellboy"" creator Mike Mignola) actually fleshes out our baddie rather nicely. Not to speak down on Rasputin, but we never really learned much about him aside from his ultimate goal. With Nuada, we learn his back-story, his noble motivations, and his relationships with those around him. It is pretty touching to see such a merciless character still show his love for his family and his race.<br/><br/>And I'm sorry, but you can't help but laugh and grin at the sheer spectacle and humanity of the story. When Hellboy and Abe drunkenly belt out Barry Manilow's rendition of ""I Can't Smile Without You"", you just wish you were there with them to sing along, because you can completely understand where they are coming from at that moment.<br/><br/>All in all, I found ""Hellboy II"" to be an excellent summer-sequel that takes the characters and story to new levels, while keeping it all grounded in its own version of reality. I give it a very good 9 out of 10 for sheer fun! Bring on ""Hellboy III"", Mr. del Toro!"

"Medacakathareal","9","2","6","12 July 2008"," Simply Incredible
","Being a fan of the first Hellboy film (due mainly to Ron Perlman's dead-pan everyman performance) I went to the theater yesterday to see the latest installment from director del Toro. After the trailer I was a little worried the film would fail by trying to do too much and therefore lose the funny quips and great characters that the original had. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is incredible. Not only does del Toro deliver some of the best CGI I've ever seen but he throws in tons of creatures we've never seen before.<br/><br/>The fights are fast paced and furious and there are quite a few of them within the film. I really have to say that the best part of the movie is still the humor, there is a lot of it, especially towards the beginning of the film. The pacing of the film is excellent, the story is well done, well acted by all parties, and keeps the right balance between a sappy love story, a summer comic book action film, and a comedy. Any fans of the action genre would be happy to see this one...<br/><br/>My few complaints are as follows: The actor who played young Hellboy wasn't really good and I don't think they played around with the conflict of Hellboy between the human world and the mythical world, he could have been much more torn...<br/><br/>Just as good, if not better than the first, definitely just as funny and even more action packed..."
"joestank15","7","2","6","12 July 2008"," Funny, Fun and brilliant visuals with little CG.
","HellboyII: The Golden Army - In the sequel to Hellboy, our titular doom-fisted character (Ron Perlman) is up against Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) who, after an age old treaty between humans and...the rest has been made, vows to take back the surface world for his kind.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie. It's better and more fun than the original. It's always refreshing to see summer movies done with limited CGI (as with Batman Begins and it's so richly anticipated successor), as these puppets and costumes are more organic and interesting than anything a computer could come up with. Stunts are also cooler than CGI, because it's a real human in peril. This is why CGI should never take over completely, because where's the fun if the computers can take over all of the artwork? When the source of creativity is always a machine, there's a problem.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman is solid funny and charismatic as Hellboy. Doug Jones's Abe Sapien also has his voice this time around, and a new level of humanity and friendship is there between these two characters. A welcome change of pace is also present with Selma Blair as Liz. She has more fight in her this time, whereas with the first movie Liz was a bit of a wet blanket, and it was obnoxious that such a sad sack could have such power (and she is most certainly the strongest powers-wise). Seth MacFarlene of all people voices a new character, and is a welcome (hilarious) addition. Luke Goss has an interesting and identifiable turn as Prince Nuada (without it feeling forced like with Sandman in Spidey3). Yes he's the villain of the movie, but often it's only by matters of perspective. In his opinion, humans have wasted the planet and I can't argue very well against that. Some issues I could've seen go deeper. Hellboy is working to destroy those similar to himself, when the people he fights to keep safe don't seem to appreciate this. Del Toro skates over this after a scene of introspection.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is excellent visually even if it's not as brilliantly written as Pan's Labyrinth. It's still very entertaining and quite funny. The freaks are running the show this time around, and the results are a big improvement over last time. B+"
"bangor_09","9","2","6","11 July 2008"," Another great installment, but not for everyone....
","Like most (if not every) Del Toro's films, Hellboy 2 it's a visual masterpiece, the creatures and realms are just great and realistic, although at moments (you'll know when) the film gets a ""Men in Black"" feel, with that being said, I got to add that the action sequences are top notch but there is a moment where the plot drags for quite sometime, and the the balance is lost, is still ""a must see film"", just don't see it on the midnight showing, or if you are too tired, because you will somehow get bored or lost, specially if you are not a fan boy, the ending was very interesting, although the last minute seemed somehow not the best way to end the film, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did..."
"RainDogJr","10","2","6","11 July 2008"," The Sons of Hellboy: A Clockwork Army
","With that title, The Sons of Hellboy, maybe I'm giving some spoilers but also a possible title for the next picture of Hellboy, you know if some old man wanted to call Jackass 2 ""The Son of Jackass"", why not that title for our red hero. Anyway, The Golden Army is a good title but by far a better army but of course not good for us, the humans. ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" begins with an old story about a battle in which The Golden Army was the protagonist that soon became a legend. A very young and very funny Hellboy is been amaze by this ""legend"" (in the unique scene/flashback with the great John Hurt as the Professor Trevor Bruttenholm) of course not even imagine that he will be the only hope for the humans when this ancient battle treat to be repeated. Meanwhile Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) is making all the necessary to can awake again The Golden Army we have similar situations of the first film with the secret team (soon will be no secret), I mean with Hellboy (Ron Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abraham Sapien (Doug Jones). Those similar situations will take them to the chaos occasioned by Prince Nuada and the action begins with small but very dangerous creatures. As I write, the secret team will be no longer secret, courtesy of our Hellboy, and a truly great character will be introduced, I'm talking of the new boss of Hellboy Johann Krauss (voice of Seth McFarlane, creator of Family Guy!) and soon all the fantasy will be here. We will see a new world and many many great creatures in it; when I saw that scene in the Troll Market it reminds me the very famous bar from Star Wars, of course the music was missing. Anyway, as the film goes Hellboy and pals will be the only hope to stop the Prince Nuada but of course it won't be easy thanks to Nuada's twin sister, Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) but don't get me wrong, she is with our heroes yet if Hellboy hits Nuada Hellboy hits Nuala (funny names) and if that sounds bad, you should know that Abraham Sapien loves Nuala! So the film also plays with love and also with the way that Hellboy is starting to see the humans. We always are so damn stupid so we can't realize that Hellboy is the good guy (""believe it or not, he's the good guy"" is the tag-line) and we can't appreciate our only hope who he is helping us in a battle that has nothing related with him but damn who can blame us since our hero is a f*cking demon with bad humor and the Beast of the Apocalypse! Anyway the only thing that really matters is that Liz believes that he is the best man so we can't be worry, Hellboy will fight against that mentioned army of gold and the results are very good! <br/><br/>Is more than excellent that Blair, Jones, Hurt but specially that Ron Perlman are here again but Rupert Evans' character is not any more here and that worked very well because even that Myers was the key in the ending of the first film this time he would not have been really useful against The Golden Army so better a team with read, blue, Liz and Johann. Talking about this new character, I didn't know that Seth MacFarlane made his voice, which is kind of cool, but unfortunately there are few screenings with subtitles in my city but fortunately Guillermo del Toro supervised all the dubbing and I founded it really good (the voice of Abraham Sapien is quite similar) and also I founded surprising that the -annoying- Jesus Ochoa dubbed Hellboy and later even more surprising that he actually made a good job.<br/><br/>Then like the first Hellboy film, this is extremely enjoyable, fast paced and definitely I would like to watch it again. I liked it more than the first one; now we have truly amazing creatures, the clockwork army and a better ""mission"" for read and blue. My only possible complaint about the first one was that after the fantastic mythology of the character we have those evil persons back and stuff but during the film Sammael is the only real opponent of Hellboy and almost until the end is when the rest of the gang appears to fight with red. So actually I think this is a superior film since it has a legendary battle that involves humans but practically only as the victims and that works perfect in the times when Hellboy is becoming a very well known hero but also we are loosing him. But again he, and now also Abraham Sapien, has someone to fight for and also to drink for (hilarious part with some Tecates and some romantic music). Finally, I'm more than glad that Guillermo del Toro is having a great way from project to project and I'm glad he made this sequel and that he will make The Hobbit and the possible third Hellboy film. So can't wait to see more and believe me, I'm going to finally get some Hellboy comic books!!!"
"wesleywisejr","8","2","6","11 July 2008"," Great story, intriguing characters, and excellent special effects!!
","M/24/Detroit - This was a very entertaining movie. I don't remember much about the first movie so I can't make a comparison but I was thoroughly entertained. Hellboy's character is a witty bad ass which goes well with all of the action and terrific visual effects. The monster scene was my personal favorite.<br/><br/>The story is interesting, the characters intriguing, the action is constant and again the visual effects are sense tingling. The best way for me to describe it would be Men in Black meets Cloverfield meets X-Men. It was a hard-hitting and funny feast for the eyes. I highly recommend this movie."
"deamianh","10","2","6","11 July 2008"," My eyes!!!!!
","Trying to find one word to describe this movie that would really get my point across is impossible. I did try. I feel, what WILL set this movie apart from the others this summer, is first of all the character depth. How fun was Prince Nuada? Watching him made me think of other movies on the horizon dealing with fantasy, and thinking ""what a mistake it would be not to cast him and his crew if there was one, as a leading role as any of the races to be played"". The whole dynamic that was Prince Nuada was breathtaking. We learn quite a bit more about the other main characters as well. Second are the action scenes. I for one felt such relief that while watching the film, I could ENJOY the action scenes and not feel any hint of ""wire fighting scenes"" that I really have come to just notice.<br/><br/>If you like Fantasy/Science fiction, Action movies. You owe it to yourself to see this film. I'm going again and taking my wife, I wouldn't want her to miss this film in the theaters, no amount of DVD watching will make up for it."
"lucasaq-1","7","2","6","11 July 2008"," A Visual Delight as Advertised
","As advertised a visual wonder with the usual wry and a bit whimsical humor to it like the first film. This is one of those comic book adaptations where my only association is through the film, but that is alright. Guillermo Del Toro has a passion for making great entertainment and this is no exception be it that it is a bit wink wink and corny near the beginning with the animatric action and stiff Hellboy, as young boy, look. There is a lot that reminds me of Pan's Labyrinth in here, but I think it is the addition of the latest addition to the team, Johann Kraus, that makes it worthwhile, a good foil at times to Hellboy, the loose cannon. As usual Abe is a great side kick and friend to Hellboy. Their beer drinking scene was tops with the humor. All around this is film to enjoy for its fantastic visuals as well as the wry humor and action. The area it suffers the most in though is the villain department. The villain is not as menacing as the last one and it comes back to the theme of where does Hellboy belong, with these magical creatures, with the humans, in hell watching the world burn? I look forward to the third film though which is implied in the ending from this film."
"lothd","9","2","6","10 July 2008"," All the ingredients are there...
","What do you expect of an action/fantasy these days? Whatever you expect, you get all of it here and something additional that's sadly lacking in many, if not most: imagination. The creature designs and the special effects that make them come alive are first class, state-of-the-art - I cannot praise them enough. The details I caught made me want to watch the film again immediately to catch the ones I surely missed. Fantastic storytelling and direction from Guillermo del Toro. I now believe the man cannot do wrong. An experience to enjoy again and again. The best film of 2008 so far - and it will be hard to top."
"Offworld_Colony","9","1","2","10 February 2020"," Where Hellboy 1 was a broad, stodgy and obvious and slightly shoddy inevitable origin story...
","...Hellboy 2 is a bristling, brisk, fun and highly creative event. It's still rough around the edges, mostly in editing and some story decisions and logic, but it brings in the magnificent Johann Krauss, the Star Warsian Troll Market, the Ghibli-esque fight with the Last Elemental and the incredible (best in a decade) soundtrack by Danny Elfman. It's cheesy but hard not to love and it feels both innovative and like a comfortable old blanket. Mr Mike Mignola might not have liked Mr Del Toro's Hellboy, but I for one, am very happy with it. Plus Hellboy fights a ton of brass robots. Awesome."

It wouldn't make a difference.<br/><br/>So for me, this is just another superhero movie. I mean, it is not a bad one, but just one out of a hundred. That was simply a bit disappointing."
"tankace","8","1","2","29 May 2016"," The hero from Hell returns
","With the announcement of the Hell Boy 3 for 2017 I though it was a good time reviewing the second movie in this franchise. To start ,the action is much better than the previous installment ,with more creative being put in the manner of weapons ,which the characters use. Speeching for the character everyone plays his role nice and Doctor Kraus steals the show with his over the top accent ,suit and his abilities, incredible if you consider that he lacks any material form and he is just air!!<br/><br/>To the plot, is a simple one on the one hand and informative on the other, to keep it simple an elver prince wants to awake the Golden Army in order to overthrow the human dominance of the world and it is up the Bureau of Paranormal Reasearch and Defense to stop him off course. The great thing is that with these plot we get also some history of how the creatures of the myths and the Humans interacted and you get why the villain of the story wants to do it. To add to the creatures the designs are incredible and the line between this a puppet , this cgi or both, is not very clear and you think that this being are there this includes Hellboy , Abe Sappien and Dr Kraus as well.<br/><br/>The sad thing is that like with the previous installment this movie was not a big box office hit because, like with 2004 movie who open the same year with Spiderman 2 ,it open the same year with Dark Knight and Iroman show the audience went to these movies and completely forgot Hellboy. I do not say that these movies are bad no Spiderman 2 ,Ironman are great and Dark Knight is my favorite superhero movie and movie in general, what I mean is that we have to be more open to what entertainment is given to us ,both to keep the variety high and to open the door to artists who want to show their own unique style, being also stated that these product is good and worth your time and money! <br/><br/>Over all if you haven seen these underrated superhero flicks do it ,you will see that they are enjoyable at the very least and to the fun out there of The Hero from Hell, gross fingers and lest hope the Del Toro has not lost his style."
"joeravioli","6","1","2","22 November 2015"," Highly imaginative, but highly dull.
","Hellboy 2 is an exercise in sheer visual imagination at the expense of depth, emotion and pacing. I mean, in what other film would the main character, a crimson devil who files down his horns to look more human, blow up the head of a nature god with a massive revolver and watch as the nature god's green blood turns everything into a natural paradise? I would hazard to say very few. That's really where the film succeeds. Each monster and set piece in this film is crafted with meticulous innovation and creativity, Del Toro putting a generous dose of creator's love into his work. However, his narrative, while also imaginative, relies too much on clichés and his characters are listless and tiresome. If Del Toro put the same love and innovation he put into crafting the visuals into shaping his characters and his narrative, Hellboy 2 would have been a fine film indeed. But as it stands, Hellboy 2: The Golden Army is limp and forgettable, buoyed by little more than few surprising twists and a stunning visual arsenal.<br/><br/>Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is a reluctant government agent who arrived from another world. He loves cats, television, and his wife, Liz (Selma Blair), but is discontent with his sheltered and secretive existence in the basement of some government facility in the middle of nowhere. He wants, as the saying goes, ""to fit in"". But of course, considering the fact that he happens to be a crimson devil, complete with horns and tail, that isn't going to happen. I did like Perlman's performance. Hellboy is a beer-drinking, gun-toting badass with a surprising outlook on life. He's an irresistible character, if a tad shallow and impulsive. But the other characters are significantly less so. Both love interests in the film are extremely boring, Del Toro seeing it fit to give them the most clichéd and hackneyed lines in the book. The villain is ridiculous, and the other characters simply aren't there enough.<br/><br/>The narrative is innovative, but lacks depth and even entertainment value, relying on strange action scenes (most of which lack fluidity) while barely ever giving us a break. I suppose that that could be taken as a pro, but I'm going to put it down as a con, simply because the running time is too short to have all that action without sufficient emotion or character development. I mean, if they could squeeze the character development and emotion into the action, I would have been happy.<br/><br/>Hellboy 2 is basically this: Years ago, humans massacred elves, and now, one of them is deciding to bite back by reawakening the ""Golden Army"", which is literally a massive army of golden cyborgs hidden underground.<br/><br/>Sadly, much of the film is forgettable, excluding some neat set pieces and a few solid action moments. But even the action scenes lack fluidity and movement, opting instead for a slow, blow-for-blow which lasts usually about five to ten minutes, making them rather plodding and unspectacular. Some of them are simply senseless, and some of them focus on Hellboy way too much.<br/><br/>What I wanted from this film was del Toro to put the same love he did into making his characters into shaping his characters. There is tension, yes, but the tension is often laughably clichéd. The characters develop in tiresome, by-the-book ways. It becomes difficult to care for anybody excluding Hellboy.<br/><br/>Creativity alone is enough to designate this film as a good film, as creativity is so often lacking in modern blockbusters. However, this film falls short past the realm of visual creativity, creating a story that is poorly paced and executed, characters that are for the most part tiresome, and action scenes that lack motion. All in all, Hellboy is a fine visual piece, but rather a dull film."

","Guillermo Del Toro once again delivers in this motion picture epic that is Hellboy 2:The Golden Army. I had high expectations for this and it did not disappoint. The sequel gives us more action, more monsters, more visuals and a much more nasty villain than the first. The weakness with the first was the villain and this one is truly an improvement. Luke Goss as the elven Prince Nuada is pretty damn cool. He wants all humanity dead and will kill anybody if its necessary, that is truly a nasty villain. Our main characters are all back and as fun as ever with the addition of Agent Johann Krauss. Seth McFarlane voices the robotic agent and I loved him every minute he was on screen. The monsters are all there as well and Del Toro once again has designed some great creations. The giant cave troll Mr. Wink, an elemental forest god, the androgynous looking Angel of Death, the cat eating Scottish troll Fragglewump, tiny insect like monsters that feast of teeth, you name it, this movie has got it. So if you love a good superhero flick, check this out ASAP."

","Out of practice writing reviews since I just haven't had time to watch new movies. I'd watched Hellboy streaming and thought now was as good as any to finally watch my copy of Hellboy II. The movie itself on it's own is not bad. It's rather good with the entertainment and the blu ray sound is a kicker. But the one single thing that sinks this movie is plot holes. Everywhere to the point of making the movie senseless. :( The embarrassing beginning with Hellboy was ouch. Think I'll skip that part from now on. A lot of knife work that is rather good just seems out of place. I thought for sure abe woulda spilled the beans on Liz's pregnancy when he was rather drunk. Nope... Totally un needed scene. And oh don't stand by the window. Hellboy is out. Like yeah the whole big chase scene in the first movie was more obvious. That was really pushed in and created such a plot hole I kept expecting it to show up in the credits. Nope no easter eggs there. Face Palm. No I don't like Liz's new haircut or her fire color. Blue was more surreal. Again Good movie but not great. The first one is great.<br/><br/>Quality: 4/10 Entertainment: 8/10 Replayable: 2/10"

"Vartiainen","Null","1","2","10 March 2014"," Now this is more like it
","The original Hellboy movie didn't really connect with me. It still doesn't. I've always felt that they spent too much time with the romance and the various side characters and not enough with the actual main hero, Hellboy. And thus I believe this, the sequel, to be the superior Hellboy movie. Granted, there's still not enough Hellboy in it, but at least the character count has been trimmed down and even the romance feels more real, for some reason. I don't really know what changed with the latter, but it just feels more believable.<br/><br/>It's also a fascinating movie in that we get to see more of the world behind the veil as Hellboy - still played beautifully by Ron Perlman - and his team have to infiltrate the fey world and meet its various inhabitants in order to prevent global destruction by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) and the eponymous Golden Army. And it's in this fey world that del Toro's vision truly shines. The troll market, for example, simply overflows with imaginative, unique and quite creepy creature designs, each more wondrous than the other. Then there's of course Johan Krauss, a German psychic inhabiting an empty diving suit, who joins Hellboy's team as its new leader. Great, wonderful design and excellent voice work from Seth MacFarlane.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is not without its flaws. Hellboy still feels like a side character in his own movie. The script doesn't allow him enough room for us to really delve into his psyche or being. Part of this is poor writing, but there still exists the problem of there being way too many characters. Also, the main villain of the film is a bit weak. Prince Nuada belongs to this race of emo goth vampire elves... close enough. And yes, he looks absolutely ridiculous and follows the proud cliché of being a whining ""my daddy never loved me"" archetype. To Luke Goss's credit though, he does manage to instill at least a little bit menace into the role, but it's still a pretty poor showing.<br/><br/>To sum it up, Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a mixed package. The visuals, the imagination and the creativity of it all are absolutely phenomenal. The returning characters have all improved, Johann Krauss is a fine addition to the mix and as a whole it's a decent fantasy adventure film. If only the script had been a bit stronger and the villain more original, this might have been just as good as Pan's Labyrinth."
"mcshermansmithy","8","1","2","7 February 2014"," A film for fans of the comics
","Guillermo Del Toro has done it again with Hellboy II: The Golden Army. Even though I prefer the first one, this one was its merits: Special Praise: The cast is still great, especially Ron Perlman as Hellboy. The story is very creative and is well-paced. And the designs for the creatures looked awesome, but what was more impressive is that 98% of the creatures in this movie are not CGI. There either puppets or makeup, and they are extremely well detailed and designed.<br/><br/>Downsides: Some moments don't make sense in the movie, particularly when a crowd of civilians starts to gang up on Hellboy after they save him, and its never mentioned again! <br/><br/>But all in all, Hellboy 2 is awesome and is recommended for anyone who is a big fan of the comics, Guillermo Del Toro, or fantasy."
"poolandrews","6","1","2","8 July 2012"," Looks great but is a bit shallow.
","Hellboy II: The Golden Army starts at an auction in New York where the evil Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) steals a piece of the Crown of Bethmora which was to be sold, the son of Balor (Roy Dotrice), the king of the Elves, the Prince wants to break a centuries old truce between the Elves & mankind & reawaken the fearsome Golden Army of giant mechanical robotic soldiers. Prince Nuada needs two more pieces of the Crown, one of which his father Balor has & the other is with his sister Princess Nuala (Anna Walton). After killing his father & reclaiming the second piece of the Crown his sister Nuala flees into the Troll market to try & protect herself & the third piece of the Crown. Meanwhile Hellboy (Ron Pearlman) the Bereau for Paranormal Research & Defense investigate the auction theft & the killing of everyone there, they follow the leads to the Troll market & Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) finds Princess Nuala who then joins forces with the Bereau to prevent Nuada getting hold of the third piece of the Crown...<br/><br/>This American & German co-production was written & directed by Guillermo del Toro & is the follow-up to his original Hellboy (2004) which I thought was a very good comic book action adventure film & while I felt Hellboy II: The Golden Army isn't quite as good it's still a fine film full of fantasy & action. Based on character's in the Mike Mignola comic book Hellboy II: The Golden Army follows a similar path to many superhero comic book films with an eccentric hero, a few sidekicks, a super villain of some sort with an absurd plan to destroy/rule the world & lots of action set-pieces in which bad guy's try to kill good guy's. The most disappointing aspect of Hellboy II: The Golden Army is how linear the story is, just how predictable & routine it feels as everything feels old & without any significant twist's Hellboy II: The Golden Army is nothing more than a straight forward build-up to the final showdown between the hero & villain. Sure there's a bit of friction between Hellboy & Liz, Abe falls in love & a new member joins the team but director del Toro was obviously far more interested in the visuals & fantasy elements than the story & character's here, that's not to say Hellboy II: The Golden Army is terrible as even at two hours long it moves along at a fast pace, it never becomes boring, there's plenty of imaginative touches to keep you watching, there's the odd bit of humour that works & some that don't while it all adds up to a good time as long as you don't look past the flashy visuals for too long.<br/><br/>As already mentioned the one area where Hellboy II: The Golden Army excels is in it's visual effects & creature design, from the guy with a wooden head carved like a cathedral to the giant clockwork army to the stone giant that rises from the ground to the guy who pushes himself along on carts since he has no legs, then there's Angel of Death with huge wings covered in blinking eye's, the Kitten eating Troll, the nasty Tooth Fairies & a huge plant like monster that rampages through New York. The CGI computer effects are excellent, the live action puppet effects are as well & it's clear a lot of time, effort & money went into the visual aspect of Hellboy II: The Golden Army. The look of the film is also superb with a fantastic opening flashback using wooden style animated puppets & an impressive climax set in a huge room full of moving cogs & wheels.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $72,000,000 this had triple the budget of the original Hellboy & it show's with much more elaborate action set-pieces & bigger effects. In mixing the superhero & fairy tale fantasy aspects Hellboy II: The Golden Army really does look terrific with a nice mix between practical & CGI computer effects work. Rupert Evans was unavailable for this sequel so was written out while the main villain Luke Goss was also the main villain in del Toror's Blade II (2002) in which he also plays the disgruntled son of a King out for revenge on mankind.<br/><br/>Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a visual feast of fantasy, strange creatures & lush settings but as a film it's a bit empty, I definitely liked Hellboy II: The Golden Army & enjoyed it a lot but I would maybe stop just short of saying I loved it. Certainly better than many films out there & well worth watching."
"sire_of_devil","4","1","2","12 March 2012"," Average movie
","The plot is exciting, but the way they made the movie ruined this plot. The giant mechanical gears, robot soldiers of golden army in the golden army hall remind me mechatronics and robotics and the awakening of the army by putting the crown on head reminds me medieval witchcraft and magic. Combining﻿ robotics with medieval witchcraft looks so blunt. Either an entirely mechanical or entirely mythological environment for the golden army would have been better. Those who over-rated this movie, perhaps prefers a predictable conventional flow of the plot. At least, it is conventional and predictable in terms of romance. Should I rate this movie highly when I correctly guessed right at the beginning that hellboy and Liz gonna love one another and that fishy creature Abe is gonna fall for Nuala? Just a typical romance plot. I also guessed correctly that at the end Nuala will do suicide to bring death to Nuada. There are so many things in this movie that you can predict right at the beginning, hence it is just a typical movie. Now the question is- do those people who rated this movie highly have so low IQ not to predict the movie plot or were they unnecessarily generous in rating?"
"Matt_Layden","7","1","2","1 July 2009"," Better Than The First, But Still Room For Improvement
","I found the first Hellboy to be incredibly average and anti-climatic. I had some hopes for the sequel, but the trailers made it seem like there was just too much going on. It seems like the film is trying really hard to create this other world in which Del Toro can have his fun, run wild and create some pretty interesting creatures and locals. Hellboy II is exactly this, but I did enjoy it more then the first one.<br/><br/>Abe is given more screen time, but his character seemed to irritate me at the end, would he really do what he does? I thought he was smarter then that. Don't tell me he was in love either, I just couldn't really buy that relationship. It seemed forced and used as a device just so that we could get to the battle sequence at the end.<br/><br/>Perlman proves again why he is the man to play Hellboy. He has so much fun in this role and it shows. Why these films don't make him a bigger star, I don't know. he has the action role down pat and his comedic bits are great. Sure he doesn't have the face of Tom Cruise, but this guy should be in more movies.<br/><br/>The film looks beautiful and it moves at a great pace. The action sequences, while great, don't add up to anything. It really just seems like they go to one location fight, then go to the next to fight. The fault of both this film and the first is that is has the potential to be really great and I know Del Toro can deliver, but on both tries the films have been just decent. Good films that you like, but wouldn't rush out to buy or remember years later.<br/><br/>The bad guy, who was also the baddie in Del Toro's other comic book flick Blade II, is the highlight. He is great and I hope to see Goss in more roles as well. Although, in the film there is a point they make about him and his sister and once they show it you know exactly how the film is going to end. The Golden Army could have been in the film a bit more, but that's just a minor complaint. It seemed like the film's climax wasn't really the biggest battle. The Nature Creature (which reminded me of Cloverfield) seemed to pose more of a threat and the film couldn't jump over that hurdle, which came mid way through the film.<br/><br/>To wrap it up, this film improves on some things from the original, but not so much to make me really adore it. I can recommend it because it's fairly entertaining and does a good job at pleasing the fans. I'm hoping the next film, they pull out all the stops and really wow us. The potential is there, they just need to see it.<br/><br/>PS: Extra points for that final shot though."

","When you have a hulking, bright red -coloured devil or rather a harbinger of destruction as the leading character and at the same time supposed to have comedic elements in the storyline, it's tough to make the film work. Guillermo del Toro and Ron Perlman made it back in 2004 with the great Hellboy – now they do it even better with the sequel, Hellboy 2: The Golden Army (2008).<br/><br/>The film starts with a CGI puppet show – from the first minute you know you're in for something unique – recapping the legend of the golden army that once unleashed will bring the humankind to a quick and painful end. When a Prince (Luke Gross) of some sort from the Magical World starts to seek the means to control that army, it's up to Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and his team of extraordinary characters to put an end to his quest - and save the human race.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman is Hellboy, there's no doubt about that. Underneath the thick layers of plastic and make-up, he's able to bring about a solid and rich performance as the titular character. The film of this sort lives and dies with it's leading character – it's Ron that carries most of the film's weight on his shoulders. The rest of the cast do as much as they can to support him; Doug Jones does again a great performance as Abe, Jeffrey Tambour is another highlight – the only one that really feels off is Selma Blair who seems to slumber her way through the film.<br/><br/>The film is visually outstanding. The sets are highly detailed, the creatures look good and the CGI is (especially in some of the scenes) very nicely done. The art direction is great – it really surpasses the first film, which already looked great. The tooth-fairies early in the film are a great example of the imaginative creature-design that the film holds through-out.<br/><br/>The film's packed with action, humour, great acting performances (for an action/adventure film) and great scenes – especially loved the ""guys night out"" -scene. What else is there to ask for? 3/4"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","1","2","15 March 2009"," Del Toro's unbelievably imaginative visuals keep ""Hellboy II"" out of the rough
","Guillermo del Toro has made his name as a director of action movies (""Blade II"") and imaginative fantasies (""Pan's Labyrinth"" and soon to be ""The Hobbit""). Naturally, combining the two as he does in ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" is going to yield some successful results, and the renewed emphasis on the imaginative mythical creature element makes this sequel crush its predecessor.<br/><br/>While the original ""Hellboy"" showed us red devil creature Hellboy (Ron Perlman) fighting off a futuristic clan of Neo-Nazis, the sequel surrounds a mythical truce between magical creatures and humans on the verge of being broken. ""The Golden Army"" refers to secret force of mechanical soldiers that can shift the balance toward one side. This is much more stomach-able than the Nazi origin story (god knows Hollywood doesn't need another Nazi film) in the first movie and it allows for the infusion of some fantastical creatures with great make-up and CGI.<br/><br/>That's really the strongest point of this film. The action is slightly above par, but the visuals make ""Hellboy II"" standout with a unique presence among the superhero films of today. There's no doubt that del Toro has the best imagination of any director working right now. Much like ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" this movie will capture your attention with its stunning and bizarre creatures. The whole film is like the Mos Eisley Cantina scene in ""Star Wars"" except George Lucas' colorful and gross monsters can't compete with the artistic elegance of del Toro's creations.<br/><br/>The plot of ""Hellboy II"" is predictable and its characters even more shallow than the first film. For these characters, it's really what's on the outside that counts: the make-up, costumes, etc. Each character is an archetype with no sophistication that spits out terrible and pointlessly inappropriate one-liners. For example, one new introduction to Hellboy's team at the Bureau of Paranormal Defense and Research is its new leader Johann Strauss, a German ghost who promptly tells a human to ""suck his ectoplasmic shvanstuker."" Also, our main hero has a deep affection for Cuban cigars and sucks down cans of Tecate beer (yes, Tecate) because his love life with Selma Blair's character Liz (she can light herself on fire) is not exactly swell--nor believable, but that's another matter.<br/><br/>So beyond the bad acting and plot clichés lies a visual fantasy/action tour de force in ""Hellboy II,"" which is enough to recommend the film to anyone with an imagination anywhere half as vivid as Guillermo del Toro. It's amazing how stunning make-up and effects can be enough to turn the likes of Hellboy into an interesting and attention-grabbing film."
"gatorduk","7","1","2","28 November 2008"," Nice... but coulda been better.
","New Characters do off set the fact that many characters from the first movie are gone. In fact, some of the new characters are amazing. However, Abe needs David Hyde Peirce as a voice actor. Doug Jones is great with mannerisms (Pans Labrynth, Silver Surfer, and all the freaky freaks he does).... But Hyde Peirce gave Abe the intellectual sound that warranted instant academic credit. It was missed in this film. And there was no reason to make Jefffery Tamblor look weak in this. Overall, a good movie. Solid acting. Great special effects. An overall ""ecological"" message was not overdone. And Ron Pearlman is always awesome. The movie does set up for another Hellboy. I hope there is. It's not Batman. It's not Ironman. Perhaps they could name the next one Hellman and it would be in the future."
"TxMike","Null","1","2","28 November 2008"," A worthy Hellboy sequel, great action.
","Even though I am an ""old guy"" I still enjoy an occasional fantasy, like these newer movies inspired by comic books. I had seen the earlier Hellboy movie, enjoyed it, and I enjoyed this one. Never to be taken seriously, it is just comic book entertainment brought to the big screen.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman of course is back as Hellboy, and now it would be hard to imagine any other actor playing this role. He is, in short, superb. The beginning of the movie gives a very brief re-telling of the origins of Hellboy and his adopted father, so it isn't necessary to have seen the first one.<br/><br/>As a young boy his father would read him a story of mythical beings in a mythical land, and now in the present time the myths become reality. The title refers to a ""Golden Army"" of robotic fighting machines that an evil Prince Nuada seeks to find, and control, so that he can conquer the world. It falls to Hellboy and his alien friends in the covert government organization to defeat the bad guys and preserve the world.<br/><br/>Again Hellboy is ably aided by Selma Blair as Liz Sherman. A totally fun movie, with lots of action. You gotta love Hellboy."

","*** This review is courtesy of Fundulgence.com - the One to watch. It also featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds and York. ***<br/><br/>That'll be the latest comic blockbuster then Hellboy returns and this time around director Guillermo Del Toro has a much bigger budget to play with. This is partly down to the DVD sales of the original Hellboy, but largely due to his success with the Oscar winning Pan's Labyrinth. For the uninitiated, Hellboy is a rock-handed demon turned good guy, raised by humans and employed by the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defence (BPRD), where he's part of a team responsible for saving the world from all manner of fantastical monstrosities. <br/><br/>Unlike its predecessor, this sequel devotes more time to the wise cracking star of the show, (played once again by the superb Ron Perlman) and the ensemble BPRD team. This freaky fellowship consists of Hellboy's girlfriend Liz Sherman (Cruel Intention's Selma Blair) whose fiery temperament extends to her physical condition, blue gilled intellectual Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), and new addition Johann Krauss; a stereotypically efficient German with an accent that makes Heir Flick sound subtle. Krauss is an ephemeral ectoplasm specialist brought in to reign in Hellboy's tendency to expose the Bureau to public embarrassment  as 'Big Red' has a Hancock-esquire ability to inflict complete carnage in the name of heroics. <br/><br/>The plot revolves around the breaking of an ancient truce between elves and mankind, and the titular Golden Army  an indestructible race of killing machines  being resurrected by Elf Prince Nuada. Del Toro may now be hard at work on the prequel to the Lord of the Rings, but the Elf race on show here are far removed from Tolkien's vision. Prince Nuada, played by Luke Goss, is more akin to the savage vampire that he played in Del Toro's other big comic sequel, Blade II. As the main bad guy of the piece, he does a solid job, being as hard as nails and hell-bent on wiping out mankind, though lacking any discernible motive. At his disposal are a legion of lethal tooth fairies and a beautifully destructive forest elemental (think Treebeard having a bad trip on Miracle-Gro and you get the idea). <br/><br/>If this review sounds like it's taking a turn for the surreal, then it's unavoidable; this is a Del Toro fantasy epic after all. The visionary director has really let loose here, and the visuals are truly incredible. It's a natural evolution on the twisted fairy tale imaginings of Pan's Labyrinth which melds perfectly with the fantasy comic visuals. Never relying too heavily on CGI, many of the bizarre creations have been painstakingly built from scratch, and the bustling Troll Market scene is nothing short of astonishing  it makes the Star Wars Mos Eisley cantina look positively run of the mill. Del Toro has also taken screen writing duties, rather than base the plot on one of Mike Mignola's comics, and it's here that the film falters. <br/><br/>The plot is formulaic, yet if the structure had been as original as the imagery and characters this would have been an instant classic. Del Toro has clearly worked hard on this labour of love in order to provide the freak show characters with more than just distinctive personalities but heart and humanity as well. Subsequently the team is on top form during the heat of battle with plenty of bickering and witty banter, which is much more satisfying than the sub-Dawson's Creek relationship issues. Whether it's the contrast between their extreme appearances and the simpering expressions of emotion, their breaking into drunken serenades or simply the unlikelihood of mutual attraction between such oddballs; the love story plot threads only succeed in slowing down the proceedings. <br/><br/>Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a visual feast, it's unlike any of this summer's many other comic book blockbusters and the striking fantasy imagery bodes well for Del Toro's forthcoming depiction of the Hobbit. True to 'Big Red' himself though, the film is big, dumb, violent and all too often sickly sweet but has an endearingly good sense of humour and is devilishly slick when it comes to a good punch-up."
"Red_Flag","8","2","7","14 August 2008"," Hell, this film is absolutely golden.
","Never before have I witnessed such eye popping visual combined with such in depth character. Del Toro knows his movies. He crafts each and every one of them with the characters in mind. He won't have his Hellboy, for one second; feel out of place in this universe. And just like Christopher Nolan did for Gotham City, Del Toro does for this utopia of trolls, elves and demons. Now as much as I enjoyed the first Hellboy it did have its flaws namely its predictable plotting. And while part two manages to take all of the best parts of its predecessor and magnify it by one hundred it still isn't able to fix its plotting. The story feels a little tired, as if we've been here all before.<br/><br/>All of which very minor grips considering this films main intentions. As an summer action flick Hellboy II really does no wrong. It's a beautifully made, cleverly hilarious characterisation flick that really allows you to connect with (though maybe not all of its characters) most of its characters. You have got to give Del Toro credit for breathing life and soul into these creations making this feel like a living comic book. Trust me fan boys will not be disappointed with the opulent colours that are sure-fire to dazzle you to the very last frame.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman returns to the role of the big red BPRD agent in this sequel to 2004's Hellboy, directed once again by Guillermo del Toro and scripted as before in collaboration with original Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. For centuries, an ancient truce has kept the naïve citizens of the human race safe from the horrors of the invisible realm -- but that's all about to change, and fast. A ruthless leader has emerged in the invisible realm, a tyrant just as comfortable walking the surface realm as he is living in the land of fantasy. When this power-mad ruler defies his bloodline to assemble an unstoppable army of fantastical creatures that he will use to wage a supernatural war on humanity, it begins to appear that humankind's days are numbered.<br/><br/>Suspend you disbelief for two hours and you'll be able to enjoy this ultra silly but good spirit action flick so ingeniously combined with in depth characters all bringing stunningly realism and top notch humour. More than anything, this film makes us eager for Del Toro's next announced project, J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, in which the director's prodigious gifts will be combined with one of the great fantasy franchises of modern times. That should really be something to see.<br/><br/>VERDICT: For fans of the series this film is absolutely golden. Its characters effortlessly taken from the pages of the ever loved comic books. In fact if nobody told you this was a movie it would be very easy to think you were watching a moving comic book. Though Hellboy II is certainly not without its flaws. A lagging plot that seems often muddled in ambition and a Golden Army awakened for a five minute battle sequence are very minor complaints in a film that is made for the cinema. A stunning achievement."
"cazaman","4","2","7","18 July 2008"," unfortunate and overrated
","I went to see HBII because of the high ratings it was receiving and because I like the character. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. Although HB's character is cool and well played, the supporting characters were too mellow in comparison. The villain wasn't particularly evil either and the golden army was really quite childish I thought. But those things aside, the whole story came off as quite cheesy and misplaced. It does not carry the kind of dark tone that the character deserves. I wouldn't recommend this film, despite it's obviously big budget, action sequences, occasional witty line and feigned attempt at greatness. Thumbs down."

","Guillermo, we have a problem.<br/><br/>While 'Hellboy II' is certainly a dazzling film to look at, everything else feels very much like a sequel. Where bigger doesn't necessarily mean better. A larger budget lends itself to more impressive effects, but if you're looking for a film that goes completely overboard in excess, you've got it. This wouldn't be a problem had del Toro spent half as much time developing a story worth being told, but as it stands, 'The Golden Army' rings resoundingly empty. A rehashed message about mankind and their craving of power and land, I never found a convincing reason for this film to exist.<br/><br/>Del Toro never quite decides whether he wants his project to be taken seriously or as an off-beat comedy, he appears to want both. And while it works in small doses, more often than not the result is a dull misfire and startling cacophony that couldn't make me care. The actors brought their A-game, Guillermo brought his dark and twisted imagination, but everything else was forgotten in the process. What a mess.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
"doctorsmoothlove","5","2","7","16 July 2008"," Hellboy II: The Golden Turkey
","Hellboy (the character) is a demon from a different dimension that comes to Earth and is employed by the fictitious United States Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. He is a blue-collar superhero and lacks the campy outfits and dialog of his Marvel and DC peers. He also has a trademarked interest in cigars and is almost always smoking one.<br/><br/>In the sequel, Hellboy, his partner Abe Sapien (the more intelligent of the two) and his pyrokinetic wife Liz Sherman are all still working with the government to protect the public. They are one day called to the site of an auction where something has attacked those present. Hellboy and friends discover that these creatures, called Tooth Fairies, have killed everyone there. Surprisingly, only one item from the auction is missing: a piece of an old crown.<br/><br/>Thousands of feet away, a young (in elfin years) prince named Nuada walks into a regal antechamber to meet with his father. He is apparently the thief of the crown piece and has been summoned to explain himself. Nuada explains that the humans are a despicable race of beings that have poisoned the land with their greed (as they have in the past). Nuada wants to unite his piece of the crown with the piece his father has and with his sister's portion to resurrect the Golden Army (an indestructible, mechanized fighting force with a fly paint job). This way the elves will be able to control the land as they once did. His daddy doesn't agree and Nuada is sentenced to death (a fate that would affect his sister since they are connected as twins). Nuada murders his father and chases his sister Nuala to create the crown.<br/><br/>While looking for clues concerning the Tooth Fairies' origins, Abe Sapien meets Nuala and takes her back to the Bureau. They fall in love and Nuala leaves her piece of the crown in a book of poetry so Nuada won't find it. Nuada does, however, know where she is due to their twin powers and breaks into a high security government facility (if our government is as poorly guarded as Hellboy II and Get Smart indicate, I'd gladly vote in favor of sharp tax increases). He doesn't actually find the book but kidnaps Nuala and injures Hellboy.<br/><br/>Hellboy, Abe, Liz, and their ""superior"" Johann Krauss (a German ectoplasm) locate the twins in Scotland and fly there. They meet a goblin who designed the Golden Army and ask him to help them locate the twins. He does and they find them in an underground sanctum. All of a sudden Abe Sapien gives Nuada the last piece of the crown and the Golden Army attacks! Apparently age hasn't been kind to the golden boys and Hellboy beats them senselessly. Before they reassemble Hellboy challenges Nuada for control of the crown. He wins and Nuada attempts to kill him before his sister commits suicide (which means he will die too). Liz melts her hubby's new trinket and the group resigns from their governmental duties.<br/><br/>As del Toro has created in the past, the monsters of Hellboy are grotesque and mythical in appearance. It's as if he took works from H.P. Lovecraft and gave them life. The CGI is well incorporated into the live action, even Liz's fiery temper looks realistic (I'll reference this film when I direct my drama about the Salem Witch Trials). Ha, if only the film's plot progression were as memorable as its characters. Hellboy II attempts too many tasks. Hellboy must fight several creatures besides the Tooth Fairies and Nuada, but most of these creatures have no motivation for fighting and only serve to develop his character or please a pre-pubescent audience. In one instance he does battle with a gigantic plant creature with tentacles that isn't even named. Abe also battles some of the creatures which presents welcomed change from the first installment. While del Toro did address some complaints critics had of the first film (being Hellboy's multiple fights with the same creatures and Abe's inactivity) he still hasn't given any depth to his enemies (more on this later).<br/><br/>Speaking of little depth, Abe Sapien and Nuala's romance is severely underdeveloped. It's odd how they are both vastly more intelligent than Hellboy and Liz but their relationship is the same cookie-cutter Disney romances that have plagued superhero films for ages. They meet and instantly fall in love. Hellboy and his ""wife"" (I think) are more of a traditional couple yet with crime-fighting interests. Other than their powers, they have the platitudes (with respect to hygiene and pregnancy) of any other couple which makes their characters seem more realistic.<br/><br/>Now, I will address some of the more striking flaws I observed in this motion-picture. Severe spoilers are ahead. The first of which is Nuada's motivation in reanimating the Golden Army. Why did he choose to do it now? Supposedly he could have begun collecting the pieces of the crown at any time. A simple reason would have added some needed personality to his character. Without any specific reason for his current hobby, the film feels tacked together without its own unique reason to exist. He also is unable to locate the final crown piece that his sister hid in the library at the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. If Nuada and Nuala are connected with magical twin energy, why wouldn't he know exactly where the book was placed? Both of these examples I interpret as lazy screen writing. The film is full of other inconsistencies, and I urge you to read James Berardinelli's review for more of them.<br/><br/>Final Consensus: ** out of ****"

Good movie, although some of the various ""critters"" seemed to be leftovers from Pan's Labyrinth. Loved the humor, and, especially, the sing-along to a Barry Manilow song. Will Manilow be the elevator music in Hell? Does Heaven use the threat of Manilow music to get you to be good? Hopefully, Del Toro will be given a chance to do the next one.

","visually stunning, but unless I bring a Walkman, oh sorry, iPod, I need a little more. As a compositor, sometimes it's hard for me to watch CGI bonanzas like this; little things like shadow color balance being off blow my suspension of disbelief in an instant. It annoys me to no end that they can put tons of expert attention into texturing and lighting but then the walk cycles are clumsy giveaways. Just as i'm getting sucked in, something lazy blows it for me. When the little guys were shoving a big door closed, they looked like puppets. And when people get tossed across a room, their path should be an arc unless they're traveling superfast, NEVER a straight line. In the beginning, when the kid was talking, his lips never closed for Ps and Bs and stuff, and that little animal part of your brain just can't help but notice. I could find at least fifty examples if i watched it again; i rarely got sucked in for more than half a minute before another stinker dead-fished my face. And those of us who are fans of dark weird stories like we hope this would be really do NOT need cheesy overblown choirs to tell us when it's all grandiose and epic; would suit me just fine if i never had to hear cheesy bombastic cliché soundtracks ever again (why does Danny Elfman get all the jobs? he's gotten so intensely boring). The schmaltzy tearjerking moments had a lot of the people around me snickering. I thought the German voice-over was horrible, then I saw why: Seth McFarlane? what in hell was the thinking behind that? and the Barry Manilow thing was cute for a minute, but playing it over the credits was like a final smirky flip off. and the glitchy credits treatment was dumb. BUT, in between the buzzkills, there are some seriously stunning visuals. LOVED the golden army, and the big space they were kept in. The troll market was a total delight, wish we could have spent more time there. But come on, if you aren't going to go that final five percent, just don't even bother."

"badbrute360","6","2","7","14 July 2008"," Good..but odd
","I saw this movie the day it came out and was actually much better than I had expected. I thought the first one was more a joke, with unneeded humor, some rather dumb writing and a forgettable plot. While this one is better it still suffers like the first.<br/><br/>First off it starts with one of the worst openings I've seen in a while. and really only starts to kick in about an hour after. The movie tries to add slap-stick comedy, romance, and action. They did action good. but kinda missed the other two. The humor was almost too much, from lame one-liners, to an embarrassing scene with two characters singing to Barry Manilow. It almost felt like the tried humor over took a serious (somewhat) plot. <br/><br/>The romance was for the most part forgettable as with all hero-action movies. But for some reason I never got attached to any of the characters. Not even Hellboy struck me as interesting. Mybe because other than being red and strong. He has no powers, no paranormal abilities you associate with a demon. And like the first movie the other characters just seem to fill in time with their little stories. <br/><br/>I guess in all I was most disappointed in how the plot was portrayed. I thought finally I would get a good movie about pure evil trying to take over earth, but it began to play more of a wanna-be Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. With goblins, wizards, elves. etc. It wouldn't have been as corny if the enemies and creatures actually seemed to pose a threat, but all throughout the movie the characters seemed to deal with their personal issues than that of the plot. Not to spoil the plot but some evil elf-like dude(who lives in the sewers!@?**)wants to take over the world with a mystical army. Okay cool, but add unneeded comedy, sappy romance, unbelievable characters, and kill the spiritual, supernatural thing and fill it with wizards and trolls. Yes trolls. Nothing just seemed to fit<br/><br/>Clearly the director was shooting for a more friendly hero(which doesn't fit cause his name is Hellboy). And he succeeded, the audience was laughing all throughout the movie. If your looking for a serious hero movie, this is not it.<br/><br/>On good notes I must say the special effects were amazing much better than a lot of superhero movies out now, and even in a laughable outfit Ron Pearlman does some great acting, not so much the other cast. So if you was to be entertained with big bangs and pretty colors this is the movie for you."

"imayne","6","2","8","16 July 2008"," A Disney Movie on Steroids
","The first HELLBOY is one of my favorite Superhero movies of all time, and to me one of the most underrated of them all. Its mix of cool, urbane wit, loving references to Lovecraftian demonology, and the framework of a medieval morality play gave it true resonance and depth. It had its heart firmly secured in being the story about a son of Satan himself as an everyman who is trying to do the right thing despite temptations to do otherwise.<br/><br/>The second film seems however, to take its cue from classic Disney. For better and for worse. Like Disney's animated features, it is capable of great beauties, wonders and terrors, but like those features, its stance is much more conservative and guarded than one that Del Toro would normally push.If you recall the great Disney moments, like ""Night on Bald Mountain"", the dragon in ""Sleeping Beauty"" and the transformation and stained glass window sequences in ""Beauty and the Beast"", Hellboy 2 is like all those moments collected and on steroids, but it also has inherited the tame eco-mysticism of ""Pocahontas"" and the autopilot storytelling of most Disney concoctions. And for that it is missing the sinister beauty and poignancy without sentimentality of the first.<br/><br/>Go see it if you want to, and I recommend you go see it, just be reminded that it's not quite more of the same as the first for those who loved the first...especially if you liked it for the same reasons I did."

","I saw this in America and I wanted to vent my frustration.....<br/><br/>The first hellboy was stylish, rough and mainly kept to the original character descriptions and humour that were in the comics. Cast was good, Design was good and nothing too over the top effects wise, to distract from the plot.<br/><br/>Then comes the second one, the consistency of the cast is not there( where is Rupert Evans???) He was supposed to take over John Hurt's role as the protector and guider and I thought he was really good at playing opposite Selma and Ron, their characters bounced of each other, oh and and why is it that not only do they disregard the consistency of plot but everything is on a much larger CGI - ""hollywood"" scale, effects wise? They always feel the need to do that when there is a sequel.<br/><br/>The story is predictable and is a bit too over the top, as usual Ron Perlman and Selmar Blair are good in the roles but I feel sorry for them as the whole thing is just not good enough for it to even come close to the original movie. Luke Goss if anyone remember's was in a group called Bross in the 80's and then turned up in the Blade sequel but I'm sorry he just cannot act for toffee.<br/><br/>Anyway, As a fan of the first and of the comics, I was really disappointed and I for one will not be watching this again.<br/><br/>Don't pay to see this, you will be both disappointed and will have wasted your money."

"ragingbull_2005","5","1","3","25 October 2012"," Easy to understand the demise of the series
","Watching this, I can easily understand why no other sequel has come in the Hellboy series. This movie works well, even brilliantly, when the focus is solely on Hellboy. However, the villain who is supposed to be planning to take over the world, is not vile or powerful enough. The other anti- heroes, like Wink, are even more shittier. Some of the action scenes are pretty good and the one wherein a forest like creature comes to hunt Hellboy is positively amazing. But still, the majority of them, fall below expectations. The best part about the movie is Hellboy. He is really awesome and one of the better superheroes outside the Marvel/DC universe. Expected better things from del Toro, the creator of Pan's Labyrinth and Devil's Backbone. am underwhelmed by my viewing experience. 2.5 out of 5."
"Lomedin","5","1","3","28 April 2011"," Harry Potter meets The Lord of the Ring (rip-off version)
","For what I remember, the first Hellboy was a dark and funny film, refreshing thanks to Hellboy's attitude and some nice designs. The creatures brought to memory Lovecraft and old, evil mysteries. This sequel is like a sloppy Disney movie. I'm not familiar with the Hellboy universe, although all those elves, trolls, and supposedly magical strange made up names had little to do with the feeling of darkness from the first movie. I had the impression of being watching a bad mix of Harry Potter and some other childish fantasy/rip-off where Hellboy just happened to be by chance. Don't get me wrong, I like crossovers. But this is absurd. The elves were nice though (prince and princess, marvelous make-up and acting/fighting), although the whole exotic elvish vocabulary mambo-jambo didn't convince me a bit. Too much of all that already. Then, the jokes seemed all to simple and re-used. Hellboy's attitude is still refreshing, but still, the script and crappy fairytale paraphernalia is too much for me. I wouldn't say it's a bad film. In any case, you certainly will enjoy it more if you are under 14 years old. I'll stick to those brilliant moments in the first film like Santiago Segura's cameo as the heroic train driver. Kids, you keep Hellboy II for yourselves."
"oneguyrambling","7","1","3","30 October 2010"," Watch it for what you see, not what it is about.
","This will probably come across as more negative than positive.<br/><br/>Hellboy 2 is a good example a pretty film with deficiencies that are hard to ignore. It is visually spectacular (especially the CGI which is flawlessly integrated throughout) and bursting with imagination, but you still can't help feeling something is missing.<br/><br/>At one stage my wife turned to me when an explosion propelled a door past 2 characters and said ""That looks fake"", and I had to say ""You mean the door going past the fish creature and the big red demon guy?"".<br/><br/>Hellboy 2 is a cool movie but a flawed film, and I can't even convince myself if that makes sense yet, there are sequences where it is a comic book movie, others a film based upon a graphic novel.<br/><br/>There is a difference and mixing the two is just confusing. As a movie there are explosions, coolly designed characters and exotic weirdness all around, but flimsy dialogue at times and some sub-par acting. Also periodically there were a few self consciously ""cool"" shots and some songs that seemed shoe-horned in to fill a soundtrack CD.<br/><br/>To put it simply, if you like awesome visuals and some scenes that are equally good in isolation, rent the DVD. It's escapist entertainment, just check your brain at the door, this one is for the senses.<br/><br/>And in GDT's defence I really think this was what he is aiming for as I am sure he can go deeper than this, as he has done previously in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""The Devil's Backbone"".<br/><br/>Hellboy and his buddies from the first film are still a secret to the public, Hellboy is still 127 year old Ron Perlman, Liz is still ""I can't act and have no personality"" Selma Blair and fish-man Abe Sapien is no longer Niles and now Doug Jones. A bunch of the actors in this are GDT film regulars and they are all serviceable, but there is a clear divide between those obviously hamming it up and the actors who are taking the whole thing seriously.<br/><br/>As far as the plot goes: (Think of the Lord of The Rings and this'll make sense) A bunch of years ago King Ballor called a truce with the race of Man that would result in him ""shelving"" his Golden Army 70 X 70 death dealing robots. Man would get the cities and all ""magical fantasy stuff"" would get the forests. The King's son Prince Nuada (who, as with his twin sister Princess Nuala doesn't have a pass to a tanning salon) covets the privileges of Man and decides to take control of the Golden Army for his own nefarious purposes. To do this he must reunite three pieces of a crown that have been separated and spread far and wide, (I just hope J.R.R.'s family gets royalties.) A unique quirk of being twins is that the Prince and Princess share each others' thoughts, pains and injuries, (something that must p**s off the Prince around every 28 days or so!) Hellboy and crew must stop Nuada getting hold of the Golden Army after they are charged with the task and Hellboy is unfortunately and deliberately ""outed"" to the public.<br/><br/>That's it really, but you know that in between getting the job and completing the job a bunch of other stuff happens that makes the task harder.<br/><br/>As with a billion movies in the last few years, the fantasy creatures live in subway tunnels, I wonder if the fantasy creatures live in tunnels near the ""Mimic"" cockroach tunnels, or near the ""Blade 2″ Reaper tunnels? My point is that GDT loves tunnels.<br/><br/>(Or if they are close by the ""Midnight Meat Train"" subway station tunnels or the ""Underworld"" tunnels, or even the ""AVP"" sewers? Lot of tunnel movies lately, do these creatures ever meet? I look forward to ""Giant Mimic Cockroach Vs Reapers Vs Lycans"" coming soon to a cinema near you!) As this is less a film and more an amalgam of ""cool stuff"", I'll leave the plot there and point out some cool scenes: - The scene where Prince Nuada confronts his Dad to ask about releasing the Golden Army looks exquisite. (""Please Dad."" ""No."" ""Pleeeeease!"" ""I said no! Now don't make me come back there or I'll give you something to cry about."") - The underground markets filled with fantasy creatures is intricately and carefully designed.<br/><br/><ul><li>Prince Nuada's offsider is totally CG, looks great and there is a good fight scene between him and Hellboy, though it wouldn't be called violent in any way.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The centrepiece of the film, meeting the Angel of Death, even though the scene is less than 3 minutes long and the Angel is a rip from Pan's Labyrinth it is undeniably sweet.</li></ul><br/><br/>The obligatory finale fight scene is serviceable and is technically impressive, but a combo of CGI, slo-mo and wire work. 80s Jackie Chan this isn't.<br/><br/>I haven't mentioned some filler stuff, and the less said about the ""German Smoke Being"" Johann Krauss, voiced by Seth McFarlane the better, as he is lousy and largely pointless as the supposed counterpoint to Hellboy.<br/><br/>Now GDT fans I'm not dissing your fly-girl, I still consider myself one of you. It's just that I think he should do better. I actually think developing something already written might suit him, as he gets a bit excited with his plot development and has a tendency to overdo things where it is not required at the expense of other areas.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. I don't think Hellboy needs another sequel at this point, (I didn't think the first needed one anyway). Watch it for what you see, not what it is about.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"
"jimjo1216","Null","1","3","6 February 2010"," A feast for the eyes and a refreshingly offbeat blockbuster
","A VERY fun comic book/action/fantasy movie from the creative genius of Guillermo del Toro (PAN'S LABYRINTH). A movie that goes against the grain for a summer blockbuster, mixing in comedy and humanity with all of the other-worldly creatures and amazingly choreographed fight scenes. The kind of movie where a demonic monster can get into fights with his girlfriend, share a beer with his amphibious pal, AND go head-to-head with an army of indestructible warriors. Not your typical comic book flick. An enjoyable ride, all-around.<br/><br/>This sequel adds a bit of a ""Lord of the Rings""-like mythology to the ""Hellboy"" universe and del Toro's imagination runs wild with the creatures and visuals. The sets are so intricately detailed and the creatures are mainly puppets and costumes (NOT CGI!). It's pretty amazing. (Check out some of the behind-the-scenes features on the DVD to gain a further appreciation.)<br/><br/>HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY is, in my opinion, a great improvement over the first HELLBOY movie. It takes the quirky style even further, to greater effect. Also joining the heroes from the first film is Johann Krauss, a mist-like character housed in what resembles an old deep sea diving suit and voiced by ""Family Guy""'s Seth MacFarlane.<br/><br/>Del Toro's HELLBOY II turns the idea of comic book superheroes on its head, while also providing great other-worldly action. I enjoyed this film to no end. (The Barry Manilow song?) I was pleasantly surprised, and I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Hilarious, action-packed, emotional, visually stunning. I love the tone of this movie. Fun for kids, adults, anyone.<br/><br/>4/5 stars"

","I cannot and will not bring myself to say anything negative about Guillermo Del Toro. Like Peter Jackson, the man has achieved a lifetime of acclaim with Pan's Labyrinth and The Orphanage, and may well rest on his laurels for the rest of his living days. Hellboy II  The Golden Army liberally uses animal motifs, but in aggregate ends up missing out on both originality and believability. Perhaps it is the backdrop of New York that makes is so over-the-top. Troll gates below Brooklyn Bridge remind one of Harry Potter, while the Troll city itself appears like something out of Star Wars. More Star Wars  Attack of the Clones when the golden army rises. By the end of the movie, I am not sure what to believe. But again, a great movie!!!"
"Tachikoma-2","9","1","3","20 September 2008"," The Dark Masterpiece
","No, I'm not talking about the crazy neighborhood Bat , but Hellboy 2. I was finally able to see it and it was fantastic. Guillermo Del Toro is one of the most exciting directors in Hollywood these days and Mike Mignola is arguably the most talented artist/writer working in the comic book industry. So it's no surprise they delivered a very nuanced story that was dark, humorous and had rich deep mythology. In Mignolas world elves are disturbing dark creatures, not the Arwens or Legola's that we are used to seeing. Tooth fairies, trolls and elves have grown up. And they've become twisted dark, angry creatures. <br/><br/>I have never seen such a beautiful movie before (save for Pan's Labyrinth). The creatures and the special effects alone are worth seeing but when you have a rich story as well...I mean it's amazing. When was the last time you saw a comic book movie where your protagonist loses a fight because he is too drunk? Or sings love songs, badly? Hellboy is more human than all the other superheroes dressed in silly latex suits combined. He is narcissistic, short tempered and oh yes pretty strong. Oh and his destiny is to destroy the entire world. <br/><br/>But it's not all good. Danny Elfmans score sucks big time. The guy needs to learn some subtlety. You don't need to hammer away when ever a dramatic moment happens in a movie. Also you just know that the movie will end up in a climatic battle between the protagonist and the antagonist. Every superhero movie ends like that. Even the good ones.<br/><br/>Still, it's amazing how well Del Toro is able to juggle between the humorous moments and the dark themes. The Nature vs Nurture thing that is so essential to Hellboy mythos is explored even further than in the last movie. <br/><br/>Hellboy 2 is one of the best comic book movies I have seen. If not the best."
"MidnightWarrior","10","1","3","26 July 2008"," A ten fold improvement over the first!
","I'll be honest, I hated the first Hellboy film. But I believe in giving second chances and, from the trailers, HBII seemed remotely interesting.<br/><br/>I am glad that I gave this film a second chance! Not only was the story and plot original, interesting and good, but the visual effects, acting, script, cinematography and direction were all top notch. Together, everything made this film remarkably spectacular and just a blast to watch.<br/><br/>One of the things that I really enjoyed was the beginning of the film, seeing the father reprise his role and having him tell his story to the young Hellboy and then relate it in CGI - that was brilliant! And then the way the entire film unfolded as it did was just remarkable; almost adventuresome.<br/><br/>There was something very dark and mystical about the film - almost like a darker, more involved version of Harry Potter without any of the magic. The script was complete, all the questions were answered and there was depth into the story characters and all the conflicts within the film.<br/><br/>The sets, CGI along with everyone else, looked great on camera. Recognition should go to Selma Blair who looked amazingly hot on screen. Ron Perlman, Doug Jones, as well as all the others looked good too.<br/><br/>HBII is nothing short of eye candy and pure entertainment. It's got the violence, the humor, the love story, the action and an overall totally wicked personality that just makes this film, unlike the first, a complete blast to watch.<br/><br/>I hope they make more HB films, retain the cast and include Jeffrey Tambor - he's a talented actor and his character is great comic element in the Hellboy films. I give this film a 10/10, but don't take any young children to go see the film."
"dvanosdol","9","1","3","19 July 2008"," Oh Crap!....
","Hellboy 2 is far superior to the first one in almost every way. In the first one, I didn't like the John Myers character that much. I thought he slowed the movie down, and I'm glad he's not in the second. Of course, he wasn't the only problem with the first, but many things in the second are far better than in the second. One of my favorite things with this film is the creatures that Del Toro created for the movie. The elves, trolls, goblins, fairies and others were just so freakin' awesome. The best thing of the film though was Hellboy himself. Ron Perlman, as in the first film, plays him with perfection. There is plenty of humor in the movie which is refreshing and the action is phenomenal. The supporting characters, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman, and the newcoming protoplasmic Johann Krauss, are excellent in there roles. Prince Nuada, played by Luke Goss, is probably one of the best characters in the movie. One problem with the movie is how it hardly develops some of the characters, such as Princess Nuala and Prince Nuada. Another is that it sort of felt rushed, even though in some points it didn't. Either way, Hellboy 2: The Golden Army is an excellent action/fantasy film and one of my favorites so far this summer."
"nospamacct-1","5","2","10","13 July 2008"," Ummm. . . 40% sucked 60% GREAT
","There is about 70 minutes of excellent Hellboy movie contained in this 110 minute movie. A large portion of this film tries to pretend that it is ""Men in Black"" with weird creatures and ""funny"" stuff. Once it finally gets serious, the movie is actually VERY GOOD. Del Toro's imagination is amazing. There is a great deal of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" flavor in this film, actually a couple of us thought that Hellboy was dealing with the same underworld from Pan's.<br/><br/>The biggest distraction for me was the new character being voiced by Seth McFarlane. I just had a hard time hearing Stewie from Family Guy as a supernatural hero."
"morkulv_athferion","8","1","4","14 September 2010"," Excellent entertainment all the way through
","I'm really starting to love Guillermo del Toro's films. His best movie for me is still Pan's Labyrinth, which together with MirrorMask is the best fantasy-film I've seen from the 2000's, but Hellboy II: The Golden Army definitely deserves a good spot there as well.<br/><br/>This film feels a lot more like a adventure-film to me, then a 'regular' action/fantasy flick. The special effects are a feast to the eyes, and the creatures look gorgeous, and there is a good balance between puppetry, costumes and CGI throughout the film which truly makes this sequel shine.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman is great as Hellboy, and I can't think of any other actor that would fit this role. The rest of the cast also gives a strong performance, and most notably is Doug Jones who played the role of three characters. The only reason why Hellboy II doesn't get a perfect score from me, is because the dialog can be bit silly here and there, but apart from that its a fantastic ride that you will definitely enjoy."
"TheFluffyKnight","7","1","4","21 September 2008"," Hellboy II: The Golden Army
","If only Hollywood filmmakers had even half the imagination that Mexican director Guillermo del Toro possesses. Then perhaps the crop of lacklustre blockbusters that assault us every summer would be able to rise above their empty narratives. Like the brilliant Pan's Labyrinth (2006), Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a tour through del Toro's eye-achingly vast imagination. The sheer delight of watching the myriad creatures and locations flit across the screen is more than enough compensation for what is really nothing more than an average plot.<br/><br/>After a couple of title cards explaining Hellboy's origin, we open on army base on Christmas Eve, 1955. A young Hellboy is put to bed by his surrogate father Professor Bruttonholm (John Hurt) with a bed time story about an ancient battle between humans and mythical creatures. In a stroke of creative brilliance, Hellboy, whose only experience of the world outside the army base is 1950s children's television, imagines the characters in the story as wooden marionettes.<br/><br/>As Bruttonholm's story goes, Balor, king of the Elves, built an army of 70 times 70 indestructible clockwork warriors (the Golden Army of the film's title), which could be controlled by those of royal blood as long as they remained unchallenged. The Golden Army was so merciless in its destruction of the human forces that Balor called for a truce: the humans would keep the cities, and the creatures would keep the forests. Balor took steps to prevent the Golden Army being raised again, but his son, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), resented his father's peaceful ways and went into self-imposed exile, vowing one day to finish off the humans.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the present. Prince Nuada has declared war on humanity, and begun work on resurrecting the Golden Army. Cue Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and the B.P.R.D. (Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense). As in the first film, it is their job to save the world from otherworldly forces. But there are other problems. Not only does Hellboy have to come to terms with the fact that he may never be fully accepted by those he is trying to help; but he also has to deal with his burgeoning relationship with Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), his on-again, off-again girlfriend of the first film.<br/><br/>What stands out most in Hellboy II is the sheer inventiveness of Guillermo del Toro's designs. It's in the aforementioned prologue, and it's in almost every other scene in the film. There is such a huge attention to detail, that you'll need to see the film several times before you see everything there is on offer.<br/><br/>This is especially evident in the ""Troll Market"" sequence. Hidden beneath Brooklyn Bridge, the Troll Market like a folklorish Mos Eisley, with every kind of creature you could imagine, and then a load you probably couldn't. It's a sequence made for DVD: you could rewind and watch it again and again and notice something new each time.<br/><br/>But what is most impressive is that a large portion of these peoples and places have actually been built, as opposed to rendered with computers. From your run-of-the-mill trolls and goblins, to fantastically original designs such as the Angel of Death (one of the best creature designs I have seen in any film), they are there, interacting with the other characters, and that's more than impressive in today's CGI-driven cinema.<br/><br/>Special mention must also go to Doug Jones, the actor behind not one, not two, but three of Hellboy II's creatures: Abe Sapien, the Chamberlain (a pale-skinned, rectangular-headed officiator), and the Angel of Death. He was also one of the humanoid insect things in del Toro's Mimic (1997), as well as both the Faun and the Pale Man in Pan's Labyrinth. Jones is surely one of cinema's greatest living performers: he gives his characters each their own personality, despite usually being buried underneath prosthetics.<br/><br/>That the look of Hellboy II is its best aspect is a blessing, because the narrative is nothing to get excited about. It's not bad, by any means; the story moves along nicely, and the characters are likable enough (especially the three main leads: Perlman's Hellboy; Blair's Liz; and Jones' Abe)."

I don't think I would disagree with one word of that.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"". I thought that it was better than the first ""Hellboy"" movie.<br/><br/>It is action packed and very funny (great slapstick), and as far away from the brooding and dark comic book hero as it is possible to go. Hollywood take note. It is possible to make a good comic book movie without having to go 'dark' on the material. I read recently that, with the success of ""The Dark Knight"", it is believed that a 'darker' take on the next Superman movie, and other movie adaptations of DC characters, is the way to go. Rubbish. Horses for courses. 'Dark' will not work for every adaptation. Here is a crazy idea. Try making the next Superman a not boring film. That is the way to go.<br/><br/>Anyway...<br/><br/>""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" would be nothing without it's cast. Ron Perlman was perfect as Hellboy, and so was Selma Blair as Liz Sherman. Nice to see Doug Jones this time being able to use both his body and his voice as Abe Sapien. I also really loved Seth McFarlane's ectoplasmic scientist Johann Krauss and the 12A rating pushing German pronunciation joke. My Nephew especially liked that one.<br/><br/>It is extremely important to point this out. ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" is a stunningly beautiful looking movie. Imagine the creatures of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" multiplied by a thousand and you will get some kind of idea of the range and variety of creatures that fill the screen during the Troll Market sequence. Amazing. Really amazing.<br/><br/>It is such a shame that a lot of movies have been squashed during this Summer of ""The Dark Knight"". According to IMDb ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" only just made back it's budget on it's US release. Hopefully worldwide ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" will do well enough to give us a 3rd movie."
"jhobdell","5","1","4","25 August 2008"," Better than 1 but still not up to scratch
","First things first: let's be honest, the first film was rubbish. For me the glaring oversight was not having a brilliantly stonking heavy metal (ish) soundtrack: the film was crying out for something gutsy to push it up. The soundtrack here was no better but it wasn't so obvious. There is a fascinating plot, and enough story development left over for a third film if del Toro fancies it. The special effects of all the characters were fantastic, particularly the Forest Elemental.<br/><br/>All that said, however briefly, this film was still hugely disappointing to me. There was little, if anything, about it to make you jump up and say ""That was a brilliant film"". I know I've said it already, but for me, this genre of film NEEDS a rock/metal score. There needs to be more emotional connection with the main characters, and someone needs to give Perlman a chance to use his huge range of acting ability, rather than being an overgrown adolescent with red skin.<br/><br/>To conclude, I'd say go and see it, but keep your expectations low if you want to really enjoy it."

It's seems like he's even better and having more fun with the character than the the first time. <br/><br/>I love the way the movie doesn't take itself too seriously but instead opens up for a lot of comedy and funny one-liners...I LOVED the beer drinking scene! <br/><br/>The characters reminded me to some extent of Pans Labyrinth, and I suspect if you loved that one you'll like this movie too. I love these movies where the director has a very personal and spesific vision, because the universe becomes so complete in and on to itself.

The story may not be strong enough to boost this up to the same level as recent, blinding superhero movies such as Iron Man and The Dark Knight, but the level of confidence, character and heart on display ensures that it is so much more than your ordinary superhero movie.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the first movie, then don't worry. This is one of the most accessible superhero sequels that I have seen, diving straight into its own story without any delays.<br/><br/>But just a quick catch-up, anyway. Hellboy is the result of an experiment conducted by the Nazis, who wished to use him for evil purposes. However, the U.S. Army intervened, and Hellboy became the adopted son of Professor Trevor Broom (John Hurt). Soon after these events, the U.S. government formed a secret organisation known as the B.P.R.D. (Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence), and Hellboy became one of their top agents, along with Abraham Sapien (Doug Jones) and Liz Sherman (Selma Blair).<br/><br/>The film opens with the professor telling Hellboy the story of the legendary Golden Army. Whereas other directors may have taken a more traditional approach to a sequence which is ripe with exposition, director Guillermo del Toro takes it as his first opportunity to put his individual stamp on the proceedings, re-imagining the sequence as an epic mix of marvellous puppetry and visual brilliance. The story is that of Elf King Balor, who after enduring much suffering at the hands of men, ordered the creation of an unstoppable force, known as the Golden Army. A special crown was created for him, which controls the Army when whole, and when worn by someone of royal blood. Upon seeing the death and destruction caused by the Army, King Balor called a truce with man and split the crown into three pieces, dividing them between the elves and the humans.<br/><br/>Cut to the present day, and Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is having problems. His relationship with fiery (figuratively and literally) girlfriend Liz has hit a rough patch, and Hellboy longs to be admired by a public uncertain of his existence. When he deliberately uses a mission as a way to introduce himself to the world, desperate handler Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor) introduces a new member to the team in the form of ectoplasmic agent Johann Krauss (voiced hilariously by Seth MacFarlane of Family Guy fame), who immediately gets on Hellboy's bad side. However, Johann isn't the big problem. The son of King Balor, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), has had enough of man's selfish ways and intends to unleash the Golden Army to destroy his enemies. All that stands in his way are the B.P.R.D. and his sister Nuala (the lovely Anna Walton), who holds the final piece of the crown.<br/><br/>Luckily, whilst Hellboy 2 has made improvements upon Hellboy, the crew and cast have remembered what elevated the original, which is heart. Hellboy is one of the most soulful and sympathetic superheroes to appear on a cinema screen, and Ron Perlman's terrific performance, combined with spot-on writing, are easily the biggest factors behind this point. Thankfully, the rest of the cast are just as good. Selma Blair has turned Liz into one of the most lovably human romantic interests in recent superhero movies. She is tough and witty, yet also vulnerable and loving towards Hellboy. Their relationship is pitch-perfect. Doug Jones is fantastic as Abe Sapien. His body language is top-notch, as is the way that Jones handles Abe's romantic relationship with Princess Nuala. As Nuada, Luke Goss lacks the searing power that Heath Ledger oozed as the Joker in The Dark Knight, but he is still effective enough to convince us that Nuada is fighting for what he believes to be right, instead of just causing havoc for the sake of it. Jeffrey Tambor provides subtly brilliant comedy as the mournful Tom Manning, whilst Seth MacFarlane nearly walks away with the whole show as the eccentric Johann Krauss.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, Hellboy 2's greatest strength is the visionary power of its visuals. The Troll Market sequence is one of those pieces of film where you must pause the images just to grasp how much commitment and creativity went into its creation, whilst creatures such as Nuada's henchman Mr. Wink and the towering Elemental are simply phenomenal in their design and execution. Much of the credit for the beautiful visuals on display should go to the packed imagination of Guillermo del Toro. Without him behind the camera, things would have been a lot more ordinary. However, this isn't just due to the spell-binding creativity of the visuals, but also the heart and soul that del Toro shows in his direction. It is this which allows us to ignore some of the story's weaker points and just enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Overall, Hellboy 2 is a fantastic experience which I definitely recommend. Everything, from the action sequences (the face-off between Hellboy and the Elemental is pure gold) to the script (which mixes some hysterical comedy and moving drama to great effect), from the perfect performances to the magical creature effects, is so utterly joyous that it is hard not to be swept into this great adventure story."

"MairegChernet","8","1","4","16 August 2008"," Much more than a mere comic book film.
","Guillermo del Toro once again proves that he is truly a visionary director, not just because of all the monsters in this movie but by how he went beyond the beyond and proved that sequels can be better than the original. Hellboy 2 is a great mix of everything you want in a movie. Starting from comedy to romance to action and beyond. And how Del Toro was able to mix these things together was just extraordinary.<br/><br/>Hellboy 2, compared to other comic book superhero movies, is exceptional. Let's start off with the cast. Almost everyone from the original is back in this one. Ron Pearlman, as always, does a great job of playing a sarcastic monster from hell whose appearance is the only thing that's monster-like. We see Pearlman's character being a caring and thoughtful almost human-like creature. Liz Sherman(Blair) also is a lovely character though sometimes feisty. And even though we don't get to see his face Doug Jones does a good job of playing Abe Sapien. New to the cast (and also face not seen) is Johann Krauss whose voice over was provided by Seth Macfarlane, the two time Emmy winner and creator of Family Guy and American Dad. <br/><br/>As far as the plot is concerned,it's about Prince Nauda and his return from the so-called lost world and start a rebellion against humankind with the aid of his abominable golden army. We see this storyline being illuminated by an excellent screenplay written by, you guessed it, Guillermo del Toro. He brings a great screenplay combines it with a great cast and a bunch of monsters, and what do we get? One of the greatest comic book based movies of all time.<br/><br/>As said on the very first paragraph, Don't expect Hellboy 2 to be just an action/fantasy movie. It is much more than that. Throughout the film, there were on and off funny moments(not pee-in-your-pants funny) but still really funny for an action film. It also had its share of romantic moments. In the intention of not spoiling the film, there won't be any more expansion on the romance part. And last but not least, the obvious. The film is action packed and fast paced. The fight scenes are spectacular and very entertaining.Lots of visually stunning monsters, lots of fights including sword fights and some off-screen deaths. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Hellboy 2 is a great improvement from the first one and it is indeed an exceptional comic book film. Itis highly impressive and again visually stunning. Go see it. It's worth the price of your ticket."
"bmcdannell","8","1","4","2 August 2008"," From a 50+ perspective: Thumbs Up
","Since we saw Mummy III and Hellboy II as a drive-in double bill we're doing sort of a twofer - reviewing both movies simultaneously and posting under both titles - because we discovered that we were actually watching the same movie twice. It was a fascinating way to see these films; giving us the opportunity to directly compare and contrast them and analyze why one succeeded and the other failed.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Ancient Relic must be returned to Undead Villain so that Villain might be reanimated in order to summon his Demon Army and destroy the World. Hero's task is to thwart this process. In the course of attempting to prevent Armageddon, Hero is nearly killed but is saved at the last minute by Love. Hero's power is not great enough to stop Villain, so secondary characters must make the Ultimate Sacrifice in order to dispatch Villain and Save the World. The End. If it all sounds familiar it's because it's also the plot of nearly every superhero or fantasy movie made over the last umpteen years. Note to Hollywood: It's time to come up with a new plot line, OK? Please? <br/><br/>We were expecting to enjoy Mummy III. First, there was Brendan Fraser and most of the cast of the previous Mummy films. Then there was the rich potential of the setting - the Terra Cotta Warriors, the mystery and lore of China...even a trip to Shangri-La and Yetis. The table was set for a feast of mystery, wonder and enchantment. How could they not produce an entertaining film out of all this? <br/><br/>One word: Writing. We're always amazed when megabuck films apparently cap the writing budget at a buck ninety-seven. Early on, didn't anyone involved in this say, ""Hey, the script we're working from really stinks!""? The rich mythology available to them was utterly wasted by the writers. Shangri-La was a cheesy set that served only as a platform for one of the progressive plot elements. The Yeti, though well done, performed their little shtick and left the scene. One appearance by the shape-shifting villain as a three-headed dragon and so much for the fascinating potential of Chinese dragon lore. The hero's skeletal army could have offered another little tribute to Ray Harryhausen (as was done so well in the first Mummy), but no, why bother? And the dialogue was uniformly clumsy, blunt and contributed nothing to either character development or plot movement.<br/><br/>The writers in Mummy III were obviously in video game mode. Video games need progressive plot tasks. So the Relic is returned to the Villain. But wait - now the Villain must carry a jewel to the mountains that will reveal the location of Shangri-La. But wait - now the Villain must enter the waters of Shangri-La to be fully restored. But wait - now the Villain must return to his tomb and summon his Terra Cotta Army. But wait - now the Army must make it over the Great Wall in order to achieve immortality. And so it goes. Played out like the levels of a video game, and with even less explanation of the rationale than you'd get in a video game. These are game levels rather than story elements, and since the audience's need to be informed isn't fulfilled, it winds up not understanding - and consequently not caring about - what's going on.<br/><br/>In Hellboy II director/writer del Toro had the more difficult task. Without a wealth of Chinese mythology to squander, he had to invent his own...but he does it so very well (to see what we mean, watch Pan's Labyrinth - please!). Del Toro is an imaginative story teller and myth maker and proves it in Hellboy II. He also appreciates something the writers of Mummy III don't - the wonder of small magic. The single moment in Mummy III that made my wife ""Ooooh!"" was the transformation of the egg-thing that awakened the emperor. Beautifully done - but the only thing of its kind in the movie. Everything else was bigger than life, overblown. In contrast, del Toro is full of small magic. From tooth fairies to troll markets to wheels within wheels, he understands that an audience can be just as enchanted by the small wonder as by the huge spectacle. It's the difference between stage and close-up magic. Make an airliner disappear and I will only wonder about the mechanics of how you did it. Make a coin float in mid-air before my eyes and I will be mystified.<br/><br/>A hallmark of both the Mummy and the Hellboy franchises is the effective use of humor. Mummy fell flat at every attempt. thanks to inept writing. Hellboy pulled it off very well - two love stricken, clueless guys getting plastered to Barry Manilow's ""Can't Smile Without You"" was delightful. We also have to mention del Toro's mastery of lighting, set design and mood. His movies are consistently visually evocative, which makes a good movie even better.<br/><br/>The movies shared one flaw with several other recent movies: climactic action scenes that go into visual and auditory overload, causing the eyes to glaze over and reducing the ability to comprehend what's going on. When we lose the ability to take in what you're showing us this is a bad thing. Please don't toss everything at us at once just because you can - let us absorb your work so we can fully appreciate it. Had the intense action not drenched us a few times in Hellboy II it would have another star.<br/><br/>In summary, both movies had capable casts and premises with wonderful potential. Mummy III failed, sadly, to capitalize while Hellboy II succeeded very well. The difference was the quality of the writing and the talent of the directing. We only wish the Mummy III crew could take a mulligan, sit down and take a few lessons from del Toro and try again. It's a shame that can't happen."
"come2whereimfrom","9","1","4","28 July 2008"," One Hell of a movie!
","Forget what you think about fantasy films, forget what you think about monster films and forget what you know about superhero films and just go and see Hellboy for the sheer visual spectacle that it is. Director Del Toro on his second outing of the franchise has filled this film with what his last 'Pan's Labyrinth' lacked all the brilliantly darkest corners of his imagination. Here we have the vision of Burton, the madness of Gilliam, the sumptuous colours of Zhang Yimou and of course the Del Toro magic that made fan-boys all over the world let out audible whoops when it was announced that the long awaited Hobbit is his next project. But lets forget that for now and focus on big red, again played brilliantly by Ron Pearlman the demon who is happy to help, yeah right, but he wouldn't be anything if it wasn't for the supporting cast of his girlfriend Liz, old pal Abe (their drunken bonding session is particularly funny and poignant) and newcomer Johann Krauss familiarly voiced by Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy, American Dad). As if that wasn't enough the excellent cast is almost overshadowed by all the weird and wonderful creatures that fill the screen, the tooth fairy, the forest god, cathedral head, the golden army themselves and that's not even mentioning the troll market which is an astonishing menagerie of all creatures great and small and weird and truly bizarre. Aside from the visuals, the music, the set pieces and the direction the thing that makes this film work, something The Dark Knight could have learned from, is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and is actually funny and although still dark (see the angel of death) it is a fun film. Del Toro has kept the themes of identity and belonging added human/inhuman emotions and still managed to add action, suspense and humour without it becoming a mess. Others have already said that this is his best English language film to date and I would even go so far as to this is his best film full stop. Very few directors make films like this anymore making it easier for Del Toro to make his mark, not that he really needs to. Peter Jackson/LOTRs fans can relax; I assure the Hobbit is in good hands."
"alexmail-2","9","1","4","14 July 2008"," Pleasantly surprised. Del Toro is going to be awesome with the Hobbit!!!
","My friend called me, and asked if I wanted to go with him to see Hellboy II the Golden Army. I was interested in the movie, but it wasn't a must see for me. So I said yes, and was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The story is very good, and opening flashback is very interesting. I love the way Guillermo Del Toro shows this flashback, because it expresses a lot of feeling. The story though slow at times, is pretty solid Ron Perlman does an excellent job as Hellboy again. Del Toro brings in a lot of side stories into this movie.<br/><br/>The scenery is really incredible. I was skeptical when they said that Del Toro was going to do the Hobbit, because I didn't think anyone but Peter Jackson had the visionary mind to do a LOTR. Del Toro has me convinced now though, because the architecture, and the character detail is really incredible.<br/><br/>The action sequences are by far the best part of the movie. There are several long sequences, and some of the sword fights are really incredible. They have the most realistic sound effects I have ever heard.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie. I wouldn't see it twice, but I had a lot of fun. Overall Hellboy II: The Golden Army delivers as another solid Summer movie. It isn't perfect, but you will enjoy the fast paced action, with Ron Perlman's wit and humor keeping you going as the story unfolds. 9 out 10"
"kalmoth","9","1","4","12 July 2008"," Mike and Guillermo, keep up the good work!
","An excellent cast, fantastic art direction, great camera-work (Guillermo Navarro shot the first Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth as well). After having seen the movie in the theater, I am most certainly looking forward to a DVD with the director's cut. A few subtle but noteworthy things I noticed. The elf city (or kingdom?) is called Bethmoora. This is the name from several stories of the early 20th century fantasy writer Lord Dunsany, where it is a great city on the edge of a desert, fallen into desolation. Also note the location where the Golden Army is hidden - Antrim County, Ireland. Lord Dunsany had a lot of kin there, although his most famous family castle (it's a museum now) - Trim Castle - is farther to the south. H.P. Lovecraft (whose work was one of the likely inspirations for the first Hellboy) considered Dunsany his teacher. One of the things Dunsany can be credited for is writing the first 20th century major work of fantasy featuring elves (pretty much the same know-it-all snooty kind as Tolkien elves). So, I wouldn't put it past Mignola and Del Toro to put in a subtle note of appreciation for the first great modern fantasy writer into their work. I also liked the hints at what might be future development of the series, but I am not sharing these here, to keep the review spoiler-free."
"garlonuss","8","1","4","12 July 2008"," A wonderful slice of Hellboy
","IF you liked the first one, this is right up your alley.<br/><br/>I say that mainly because the darker tone, the occult nature and the unusual imagery do have a tendency to put some movie-goers off. But if you simply want to see a movie about a demon who was raised by humans to fight evil, this is a great movie for you.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro's direction style is very kinetic and flowing. This helps keep the pace of the movie going, keeping it from feeling like it is dragging. The scenes flow very nicely from one to the next (which is also done very nicely with some creative wipes and overlaps).<br/><br/>The real draw for this film, however, is Hellboy and the team that has been provided for him. Ron Perlman is the absolutely perfect Hellboy. His delivery of the lines is nothing short of perfect in creating an acerbic, yet ultimately lovable (as well as loving) character. He has a wry humor about him that makes the Hellboy character something that we can all relate to. We've all had times when we feel under appreciated. We've all felt like the unwelcome outsider. Yet despite all of the inducements that he has to give up defending these humans, he continues to do it because that is what his ""father"" taught him to do.<br/><br/>Of course Abe and Liz are here as well, and Doug Jones and Selma Blair each do a wonderful job of portraying their respective characters. But this is not their movie. It is interesting, however, to see one of the story elements of the first movie get turned around to portray the other side of it in this one when the team encounters the angel of death.<br/><br/>In short, as I said above, if you liked the first one, this is just your kind of movie. I look forward to seeing what del Toro has in mind for the third movie. (Of course, we'll have to wait for him to finish ""The Hobbit"" first.)"

","Hellboy 2: The Golden Army (2008): Dir: Guillermo del Toro / Cast: Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Doug Jones, Seth MacFarlane, Luke Goss: A much heavily marketed film than the original although it does present a much better detailing into the lives of the characters. Its impressive creature effects continue to overwhelm us with a plot regarding a golden army that was created to wage war on mankind but a truce was found. Directed by Guillermo del Toro who made the first Hellboy as well as Pans Labyrinth. The special effects are the norm here but fortunately characters seem broader. Ron Perlman plays the sly and never fearful Hellboy whose relationship with Liz Sherman, played by Selma Blair is shaky. He toys with media attention but soon realizes that responsibility will be needed for a very different future. Liz makes discoveries and will eventually bargain for Hellboy's life. Doug Jones returns as the fish-like Abe Sapien who will discover love and the ability to shed tears. Seth MacFarlane plays Johann Krauss who is brought in to help keep Hellboy from encouraging publicity. The role is effective but somewhat standard. Luke Goss plays the villain Prince Nuada who is skilled at martial arts and being a total sh*t disturber. While visually well made it is still a pointless exercise with an army of screenwriters that were far from golden. Thank goodness for creature personalities. Score: 4 / 10"
"eric262003","8","1","5","8 February 2010"," Great Improvent Than The First Part
","After watching the first ""Hellboy"" movie, I though it was one of the most oddest movie I ever saw. Sure I enjoyed it immensely, I though there were a few quips that needed more further explaining. But I digress to say that it succeeded into capturing a fantasy and making it as real as possible. ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" steps up the ante an extra foot to let it's audience enter into a world of magical creatures, awesome heroes, and colorful villains plenty of jam-packed adventures that should keep every ""Hellboy"" fan intrigued.<br/><br/>The smooth-flowing introduction reveals his origins and a fairy tale about an epic battle where humans engaged in a war with the magical creatures over land that opened up for an elite group known as The Golden Army.After the extreme rubble that the army has done, the King makes a pact with the humans by letting them reside in the cities, while the creatures have complete access to the forest. The Crown which was in the army's possession has been split into three pieces and the Army was then buried. Prince Nuada (the Woodland King's son) abandons the area, and will only return if ever needed by the villagers. <br/><br/>The fairy tale story is presented with an immaculate fashion, but the character development has improved immensely from it predecessor, and that every character in this story enjoys their little fun in the sun.Not one character, big or small usurps anyone. <br/><br/>The relationship between Hellboy and Liz (Ron Perlman and Selma Blair). The chemistry between them goes beyond the parameters of love at first sight as their commitment is more panned out. However, a quarrel takes shape which eventually breaks into an ungodly inferno. Doug Jones' Abe Sapien gets more screen time and falls smitten over Princess Nuala, (Nuada's twin sister)and one of the keepers of the broken crown. It's great that Abe is more involved in the story than just a mere sidekick. Newbie to the story is Johan Krauss also has plenty of moments for himself and becomes a formidable protagonist to the heroes. The only weak link is Jeffrey Tambor who's just a low-key comic foil as an agent assigned to watch over the veil of secrecy that they abide by.<br/><br/>The best character of the ensemble of characters is the Prince Nuada mostly due to the complexities of his personality. If he wanted to, he could have been the typical evil villain, but I see him as a misunderstood individual who conducts rightful things in an evil way because that's how he accomplishes things. It's such a refreshing break from all the other tiring clichéd video-game reject villains who's conquer the world purposes get to be tiring and repetitive. Here we see a villain who's actually not trying to be powerful for his own selfish agenda, but for the sake of others.<br/><br/>The sequel to ""Hellboy"" expands more in the creature and special effect market thanks brilliantly to creature specialist Guillermo del Toro who directed this movie. It's good that the effects looked more real as opposed to the cheesy computer graphics that has been plaguing our screens for years.The characters come on when the scenes were needed of them and everything was handled nuanced. Even the masterful score of Danny Elfman contributes as the story progresses.<br/><br/>In the end ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" makes for a satisfying movie that's more complete than the first installment that unites the real and surreal very subtle that will surely please everyone of all ages and never insults your intelligent. And look out for the amazing Barry Manilow number too."
"dr_brendan","4","1","5","9 February 2009"," Now That Guillermo Del Toro Is Famous He Can Do Anything He Wants
","I believe that when any director has too much freedom the film can be in trouble and this is one of those cases. You give Del Toro a sandbox and he'll give you monsters that have musical numbers. Half of the film was fine. The audience get's what Hellboy is all about, fighting monsters, balancing his love life and getting along with the people he works, while the other half of it was weird and not really needed in a super hero film. For example the romance felt fake, for some reason there is a musical number and the ending might as well just be the start for another movie.<br/><br/>However, is this what the director was going for? Was he going for an entertaining movie or a serious take on the subject of Hellboy? Whichever this fantasy epic falls flat due to awkward storytelling and strange not needed musical numbers."
"thecheatevur","7","1","5","31 July 2008"," Pleased, but unsettled
","Personally, I thought Hellboy 2 was great, though not better than the original, which is a bit shocking. Perhaps it was the change in production since Columbia dropped it and Universal picked it up, maybe the writing was just different, and maybe it was because the plot honestly seemed a bit scattered. I don't know.<br/><br/>But one of my main peeves was the fact that good old John Myers was absent, which completely contradicts the first movie and Professor Broom's intentions. They say Hellboy sent him to Antarctica because he was threatened by Myers for Elizabeth Sherman's affections, but recall in the first movie when they actually got along? Myers really only had any interest in Sherman in the first half of the movie and backed off when he knew she was Hellboy's girl.<br/><br/>I really just hope that the actor Rupert Evans made the choice not to be in this film and the writer didn't just push him out randomly. But, so far, I have found no evidence of either theory. All we can do is hope Myers comes back from the South Pole in the likely third movie and we can have a ""normal"" person to relate to once again."
"DarthBill","7","1","5","28 July 2008"," Entertaining if Idiosyncratic
","PLOT IN A NUTSHELL: Long ago, there was a war between humans and elves, which led to the creation of an unstoppable force called the Golden Army, which annihilated the humans, but the elf king decided that he went too far and made a peace treaty with the humans, much to the anger of his son, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), who saw the humans as beneath his kind. Centuries later, the Prince has decided to break the treaty and take the crown pieces necessary for controlling the Golden Army. Humanity's only hope is Hellboy (Ron Perlman), who has recently outed himself to the world, and with him the Burea of Paranormal Research & Defense, which includes his flame throwing girlfriend Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) and his amphibian fellow Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), who falls in love with Princess Nuala (Anna Walton), who has chosen to oppose her brother. Who will survive? If you've read the other reviews, you probably know.<br/><br/>Entertaining sequel to the first Hellboy from 2004. Del Toro shows a great visual flair that is hard to match, and the action sequences are highly engaging, though it's a shame his film had to come out in a season over-saturated by visual effects everywhere.<br/><br/>I do have some beefs with the film though. In some ways, the film seems to have reset Hellboy as the immature adolescent in a man-demon body that he was in the first film, and perhaps taken him even further back than that. I never expected them to become friends, but after saving Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor) at the end of the first film and being assisted by him in slaying Kronen, followed by the cigar bonding, I expected that they would at least try to be more civil with each other in the sequel. Here though, Hellboy seems to be going out of his way to make Manning miserable while a strangely squeamish Manning is so desperate for cooperation that he's reduced to bribing Hellboy with cigars in hopes of getting him to behave. As funny as it is on the surface, Hellboy shooting at pictures of Manning & posting them around the bureau was a bit cruel. Hellboy blithely exposing himself to the world simply because he wants to be respected as a heroic celebrity regardless of what the consequences might be for his non-human friends, Abe & Liz, also goes a bit too far in the selfishness department. This of course comes back to bite him in the ass in true careful-what-you-wish-for fashion, when, after saving a baby AND slaying a forest god, the people react with fear & hatred towards our red hulking hero instead of being grateful in a moment that could have been ripped from the X-Men (the alienated hero as symbol of prejudice victim did not really appear in the original Hellboy comics BTW). Could Hellboy have really been THAT naive to think the human race would embrace him? Liz Sherman perhaps says it best after the incident - ""Does everybody have to like you?"" Then there's Hellboy's romance with Liz (which does not exist in the comics). Much as I like Selma Blair in the Liz role, after Spider-Man 3 it was kind of unpleasant to jump back into yet another ""super couple"" with relationship issues. And at times Hellboy comes off as a real prick towards her, and not a lovable prick either despite Ron Perlman's best efforts.<br/><br/>Another problem is in the romantic subplot between Abe Sapien & Princess Nuala. The problem? The problem is the subplot is not given enough screen time to be properly developed, so it feels rushed & unconvincing, even though the few times that they are together Abe & Nuala do generate a certain sweetness, due in large part perhaps because Anna Walton fills the character with an angelic sincerity that makes her more than just a goth chick.<br/><br/>In case you're wondering why John Myers isn't in this one, it's because his actor, Rupert Evans wasn't available, so he was written out."

I admit I have not read the Comics of HellBoy so I don't know how it went. But I felt that the plot of this movie was weak. The story could have ended much sooner.

That isn't to say the first Hellboy was bad, it was just a big summer blockbuster that was watch by most people only once.<br/><br/>Well for that reason alone I'm glad to see that it got made. I wasn't the biggest Hellboy fan, I thought the first movie was entertaining enough to watch, but I did respect it. The second is noticeably better, but I still wouldn't say I'm rushing out to buy the B.P.R.D trades. I guess the metaphor I'm looking for is, it's a like a girl (or guy) you've been dating but she (or he) just isn't your type but you have some good times. Basically Hellboy is just a friend, at least to me. <br/><br/>The film is filled with amazing effects, and actually as soon to be film student I would watch this film again just to admire the effects. Great characters designs, sets, props, everything is top notch. Best of all CGI is not abused, yes its there obviously, but it has to be, but that is why CGI should exist. No matter what advances are made, I do not believe they will ever make a character or object with CGI look like it really exists. <br/><br/>I should point out that in terms of execution the movie is great; the script is where my problems lie. The plot centers on a standard mcguffin, the pieces of a crown that allows the wearer to control the golden army (a unstoppable robotic army). It's the decisions made by the characters in the film regarding the crown that really bothers me. I'll have to delve into spoiler town here, so if you haven't seen the movie and intend to its probably best to skip down to where I say its safe. During the second act the last piece of the crown is in the hands of our heroes, given to them by the twin sister of villain (with whom she shares a psychic link).. She hides it in a book, but He only knows that it is a book not any book. He fights and wounds Hellboy, He tells them He will heal Hellboy in exchange for the piece and goes off. His friends decide to take him to him, however they didn't plan on taking the piece except his friend Abe does because He loves the villain's sister and the villain said he will never see her again if he doesn't get the piece. So Hellboy gets healed by the amazing angel of trilogy foreshadowing, and the go off to kill the villain, but of course Abe gives up the goods and the Golden army is unleashed. <br/><br/>Here are my problems with this:<br/><br/><ul><li>If the villains sister (Princess whateverhername) knew her brother could find her, why didn't she just say ""here's the crown piece, hide it some place far from me"" and leave them? Also she informs them of this fact when He's about two minutes away, and she says it like its nothing, like She doesn't think it could happen. - The Prince, instead of staying to slaughter everyone (and you know He could) and find the piece in one of the books (there isn't that many), He leaves it up to the heroes. Come on. He could of tossed the shelf over and the piece would of popped out of the book. - Abe gives up the piece cause He loves her, good idea except you got to see about as much as her regardless cause now you are gonna be flattened by a giant robot army. - BIG SPOILERS: Princess whatever dies if her brother dies, and the same goes for him. So it would of saved the world a lot of trouble if she does what she does before He makes the crown whole. I understand that It is a difficult decision but does she any other end to this. - MORE BIG SPOILERS: It ends with Liz (Hellboy's girl) melting the crown with Her fire powers. OK. WHY DIDN'T YOU DO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE THE THIRD PIECE!</li></ul><br/><br/>I know the answers to this because then there wouldn't be a third act. But come on, if you have holes in the writing fix them, don't just say 'Go with it, its not Shakespeare'. They are easy problems to fix. <br/><br/><ul><li>Instead of having the brother know exactly where they are via thoughts. Have secretly place a tracking device on them, I mean sure its not great but its just as pulled out your ass as the telepathic tracking and the princess doesn't know about it. - Simple, have him take the piece and instead the Abe betrayal bit, it becomes a much more exciting race against time. - This one is fixed by the above sentence. - Now this one is trickier, but my suggestion would have been to not have telegraphed it by a mile away. Instead of someone saying ""She'll die if He dies"" they should instead set it up earlier by having Abe ask ""If your brother dies do you die?"" and Her asking ""I dunno, I've never died before"" and then that at least gives you the excuse that it hadn't come to her by that point to do that. - So easy watch Raiders of the lost ark and tweak that ending enough so it isn't a rip off. Just say it indestructible or something and the crown pieces must be hidden. SPOILERS END</li></ul><br/><br/>So instead of a 9 or 10, I give it a 7. Entertaining, and a lot of skill and hard work went into it, but not a personal favorite. rite."

","Hellboy 2 was a great time and I was entertained while watching it. That being said I didn't really think about the movie much after it was over. The special effects were very good. The villain was creepy and I will never think of an elf the same way again. It was good to see Abe get some more screen time for the second film and the new ethereal German was a cool addition as well. All and all there are worse ways to spend 2 hours and it's probably worth the $10 for most people to see it.<br/><br/>The ending left no doubt of a third installment and I found the final fight of the movie to be quite satisfying."
"Sebastian1966","9","1","5","14 July 2008"," Guilliermo del Toro unchained.....
","Granted, the first film, Hellboy, had the harder task; to lay the foundation. The 2nd one, Hellboy 2: The Golden Army gets to have all the fun! HB2 takes the wonderfully eccentric cadre of misfits (the blue-collar demon slayer Hellboy, his fire-starting 'flame' Liz Sherman, amphibious ally Abe Sapien and the new, gaseous entity Johann Krauss) to the next level. And all the actors (Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Doug Jones and now Seth McFarlane as Krauss' voice) rise to the challenge! Gone is the 'normal' human and audience-surrogate Agent Myers; and frankly, good rid-dens! Now the inmates run the asylum, and that is as it should be! The pacing is tighter this time around (didn't look at my watch once), unlike the first film which lagged in spots here and there. The 'mission' this time is to stop an underworld Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) from bringing about a revolution that'd topple humans from dominance (using the dormant, titular 'golden army') and bring about a new world order of supernatural beings (and he reasons that by doing so, he may be doing the planet a favor; making his character not entirely unsympathetic). Nuada's empathic twin Princess Nuala feels differently, and allies herself with Hellboy's gang of supernatural-buster misfits for help (and has a tender relationship with Abe in the process). Along the way there are highly imaginative sequences woven throughout the film that are simply stunning to behold. Director del Toro brings more artistic influence from his darkly beautiful ""Pan's Labyrinth"" into this film. But the sardonic, 'blunt instrument' Hellboy is there to keep it all wonderfully grounded (unlike the lofty, dull, eye-candy fests such as Lord of the Rings and other pompous, self-important epics). Love is a major new ingredient of this movie; the twin's empathy for each other, Hellboy's rocky ongoing relationship with Liz, and Abe's affection for Nuala. One of the greatest scenes in the movie is NOT a special effects laden fight scene, but a drunken duet by Abe and Hellboy of Barry Manilow's ""Can't Smile Without You."" It is my favorite scene in a film filled with gorgeous set pieces (another highlight is the destruction of a 'forest god' in the middle of an ugly urban setting; seemingly proving Prince Nuada's point). The reason this scene stands out is simple; throughout the gun-toting action and jaw-dropping, unearthly, elegant visual effects the non-human characters maintain a deep, yet simple humanity that is the best effect of all. Guilliermo del Toro and Mike Mignola have turned in a sequel akin to ""Bride of Frankenstein"" or ""The Empire Strikes Back"" in that it takes the world of the parent film into stratospheric heights of both spectacle and heart. Putting it simply; I liked the first Hellboy, but I LOVED Hellboy 2! And as Hellboy might say, ""That ain't no crap!"""
"barrys82","9","1","5","14 July 2008"," A movie worth to watch
","This was really a very good movie, A film written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, the man that brought us the magical Pan's Labyrinth. If you enjoy the first Hellboy movie, this one is a 100% better, it is funnier it has more action and adventure it even has a little romance. The special effects are awesome, the story is better and more interesting, The mythical world starts a rebellion against humanity in order to rule the Earth, so Hellboy and his team must save the world from the rebellious creatures. The movie has the characteristic fantasy of Del Toro's movies with incredible creatures. The rhythm is quick, a thing that won't let you get bored. The cast is very good, Ron Perlman is great as Hellboy, this role fits perfectly on him, Selma Blair is also very good with the difference that her character has a sweeter touch this time, Doug Jones as ""Abe"" Sapien was excellent and very funny. Well to conclude, Hellboy 2 was a real joy and completely worthy, totally recommendable."

","Hellboy 2 is yet another film with summer fever, the symptoms of which consist of adrenaline pumping and jaw dropping special effects, imaginative designs, snappy dialog, and plots and characterizations not worth the ink that wrote them.<br/><br/>Like ""Iron Man"", ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Indiania Jones"", etc, it's a fun ride, and like them as well, at the end there's' not much to think about, and the more you may think back the less and less satisfied you may become with all the non ""super"" portions of the movie.<br/><br/>I will say this of all the summer fodder, so far, Hellboy was the one I found the most entertaining. Hellboy, was never the most well written comic in the world, it's charms lie largely with the artwork and the way relatively unknown mythologies from all around the globe get blended into the classic troupes of pulp comicdom. In the film this translates into talking psychic mermen named after Abraham Lincoln, Ghostly non corporeal German doctors bound in their fishbowl suits (and voiced by Seth Mcfarlan...the same voice used for the evil German dr. in the body of the goldfish from American Dad), a grown up version of Stepehen Kings ""Firestarter"", forest elementals, cannibalistic pixies, and the anti-Christ himself acting more like ""The Thing"" from ""The Fantastic Four"", down to the cigars.<br/><br/>Helllboy was never that great of a story in and of itself, and here is no exception. The villain is particularly non threatening or sympathetic (the characters of Shrek and Neverending Story make better claims for there fairly-lands).<br/><br/>Good combination of CGI and traditional special effects. Good characters in a stale melodrama, which doesn't mix well with the action adventure portion of the story. Its worth seeing for the sheer spectacle, a good combo of the images of Pans and Hellboy 1, but not too much of the brains or heart of either.<br/><br/>Which is not to say I didn't like it, though stiff in places it does perfectly capture the super-adventure in it's bizarre and ridiculous glory. Though the summer sickness, can reduce a film to ashes often quickly enough, with Hellboy it's produced a conventional, but still dazzling fever dream"

Del Toro has put comedy, action, adventure, romance, and singing. it is a must see, and Seth Mcfarline yes, the guy from family guy is the voice of Johanna Grauss.

","Hellboy II: The Golden Army opens (as most comic book movies do) with a back-story. In ancient times there was a war between humans and a magical, invisible realm. This fantastical kingdom led by King Balor creates an army of golden soldiers. (Think Lord Of The Rings meets Transformers.) However, this army is too powerful and, since they aren't human, they ruthlessly slaughter every enemy on the battlefield yielding no quarter. King Balor, realizing the error of his ways, forms a truce with mankind. Man can have the cities and his kingdom will live in the forest and shadows. Flash forward several centuries and King Balor's son, Prince Nuada, wishes to break this truce and wage war on humans. But first he must usurp his father's throne and then reassemble the mystical crown that will allow him to regain control of the Golden Army.<br/><br/>If you're eyes haven't glazed over after reading all that, then you'll love this movie.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro returns as director for Hellboy II and it's safe to say that this movie would quickly disintegrate without him. As strong as Ron Perlman's performance as Hellboy is, it would be a wasted effort without the love and care that del Toro obviously has for this world. Del Toro allegedly passed on directing a number of very high profile films (I Am Legend, Halo, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince) in order to return to Hellboy. He clearly has a great deal of love for this universe. As evidenced in the first Hellboy and Pan's Labyrinth, del Toro loves creating and filming unusual creatures. This being a sequel, the budget is higher and every penny of it appears to be on the screen.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman has a blast in the roll of Hellboy - the candy-eatin', cigar chompin', cat-lovin' spawn of Satan. Much of the humor in the Hellboy franchise comes from the incongruity between the way these characters look and the way they act. They may look like they're from the bowels of Hell, but the love cartoons and kitty-cats, classic literature and Barry Manilow. As tough or creepy or scaly as they might be, they have quirks and foibles just like everyone else. To quote the bard: ""If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die?"" Of course, let's not give the film too much credit by dragging Shakespeare into all this. At the end of the day, this is just a movie about big monsters punching bigger monsters. But, thanks to del Toro, it's fascinating to look at and it's briskly paced.<br/><br/>Doug Jones returns as Abe Sapien, a fish like humanoid that has to wear a sort of reverse scuba gear when leaving water. In the first film, Jones played the physical part but, at the studios request, the voice was dubbed in by David Hyde Peirce. The studio figured that DHP was a bigger star and would be able to help better promote the film. However, DHP was so impressed at what Jones brought to the character without words that he declined a credit for the film and refused to do any press for the movie. He so wanted to honor Doug Jones performance that he even tried to emulate his manner of speaking when he recorded his dialogue. This time Abe is all Doug Jones. While Jones does a fine job, sometimes his performance (with his slight frame, overly polite manner and British accent) is a little overly reminiscent of C3PO.<br/><br/>Abe falls in love with Princes Nuala, Prince Nuada's twin sister. They have a sort of Corsican Brothers relationship where if one is caused pain the other will feel it too. The twins also seem to have a, shall we say, ""close"" relationship. This is never overtly addressed (so don't let it stop you from bringing the kids), but it is certainly an underlying element of their relationship. And, really, if there is one thing that America has been clamoring for when it comes to our summer blockbusters, it's more incestuous subtext.<br/><br/>The action pieces are fast and furious in this film but nothing ground breaking. Hellboy fights a big monster, Hellboy fights a really big monster and, just to keep it fresh, Hellboy fights a lot of little monsters.<br/><br/>For all of Hellboy's inventiveness, whether it be as a comic book or on the big screen, it's never really resonated with me personally. But it has a legion of fans (no pun intended) and they certainly won't be disappointed by this outing.<br/><br/>On a 2008 summer super-hero scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being Iron Man and 1 being Hancock, Hellboy II: The Golden Army gets a 7."

It feels like Del Toro put a lot more time into this then he did in the original.<br/><br/>I was worried about going to this because the original wasn't the movie i expected. But i am glad i went.<br/><br/>I have to give a mention to the light comedy and music. I was laughing out loud. There are some hilarious scenes that are worth going to see this. The music was very unexpected. I was singing along.<br/><br/>This had a much more interesting story then the first one.<br/><br/>Overall this was a million times better than the first Hellboy.

","I have never felt compelled to write a review on this site in the past due to the fact that i usually find that users get it right and i rely on this site for all my info on movies except unfortunately for this one.Now,i understand that tastes vary from one person to another but like i said i usually agree with the vast majority of the users on this site,so i went to see hellboy with great expectations but alas i was extremely disappointed both about the film and the user comments that i read before i went to see it.Let it be known that i loved the first movie and i am a big fan of the director and that this is the type of movie that i usually love and always have an opened mind about.First:The story just does not flow well at all, and events do not get explained or resolved all through the movie and the little info you get is done in a quick and dismissive manner which is odd considering the director which is a master at storytelling in my opinion.All the relationships in the film fell flat and lacked believability,from red and liz to abe and the princess to kraus and the team.All the performances were poor because most likely the actors could not know how to react to situations that were not fleshed out.The real stars of this movie are the special effects which are great but again they don't have a reason to be there other than to look good and make a great trailer.It seems Del Toro spent so much time creating these effects that he did not bother to flesh them out and be concerned with the main characters and the story.Second:The story is absolutely unbelievable and in many parts seems rushed to leave room for creatures that have nothing to do with the main storyline.The slapstick humor in the movie fell flat for me because it has no place in a hellboy movie.I mean come on ,the scene with kraus and Hellboy in the locker room is simply ridiculous as well as a missed opportunity for a show down of epic proportions between 2 very worthy opponents.I wont go through them all but all i can say is that if i wanted to see the 3 stooges i would certainly not go see hellboy which is by the way the son of the devil and is about destruction and death and the end of the world ,which is not really a funny matter as far as i am concerned.The love stories to me were pointless and unnecessary because again,people do not want to see love stories when they go see an action movie,a little is OK i guess but to have all team members being lovesick at the same time is a bit much.Finally:Well what can i say about the movie other than that.To me the whole thing was a mess,from the story,the pacing,the acting,the directing and the ending which again was thrown together like the rest of the story as well as very predictable.So there it is folks,my first review and ill leave you with this.Consider this film to be more about the director than the characters and expect great eye candy with no respect for the audience and its characters and you might enjoy this as much as Del toro's massive ego but if i were you i would wait for the DVD and hope that they have a killer uncut special edition to tie up all those loose ends."
"WillJohn68","7","1","8","13 July 2008"," Why It Sucked, And Why It Didn't
","I like ""HellBoy"" a lot. I still kick myself for missing it on the big screen. For a special effects-heavy monster/sci-fi/fantasy movie, it had tons of warmth, humanity and heart. This was what I was expecting from ""HellBoy 2: The Golden Army"". Didn't get much warmth, and very little humanity. Sure, some could argue that a movie about demons and goblins and elves wouldn't HAVE any humanity. But it can have heart. This sequel simply falls short in what makes the first one so endearing. It certainly was photographed beautifully, and yes, the effects were wowie-wow-wow impressive. But what movie since ""Jurassic Park"" doesn't boast uber-realistic, ""in your face"" sound and visual effects?<br/><br/>With all that said, here's why it sucked: It didn't have David Hyde-Pierce as the voice of Abe Sapien, Jeffrey Tambor's character was unnecessarily weaker than in the first movie, the character voiced by Seth McFarlan was annoying as all get out, and the switch from humanity's ""Yay, good monsters are saving us from bad monsters"" to ""Booo, the good monsters are bad too"" sentiment was way too abrupt.<br/><br/>Why it didn't suck: It had Selma Blair.<br/><br/>Hopefully if Guillermo del Toro does another ""HellBoy"" movie, he'll avoid the gratuitous overload of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""HellBoy 2"", and get back the same kindheartedness of the first ""HellBoy""."

","13 July 2008. The best thing about this movie is the trailers. The worst thing about this movie is the movie itself. Unfortunately, from the very beginning, there is the small, child Hellboy who doesn't have much striking resemblance to the adult Hellboy, an initial dissonance that doesn't stop. There's the initial monster attack at the auction establishment on our superheros who miraculously aren't eaten alive for some reason and seem to be given some free pass from getting covered by the nasties. The character's are so stereotypical and one-dimensional with a superficial veneer of supposed humanity and relational caring. There are many scenes that are just special effects-driven that attempt to attract the audience by razzle-dazzle that don't have much that hasn't been done before and seem to be just thrown in. There are a few cute lines, but the one-liners get old. It's actually Prince Nuada who seems to have the most interesting and compelling role in his attempt to redeem the world from the disposable and resource consuming race of humans.

","If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. 2004's Hellboy was mostly a dull, plodding movie. Every once and a while there were flashes of potential from the creative team: a crackling one-liner, an iconic image, a piece of hard-hitting action, a great character moment. But on the whole, the whole thing felt watered-down, forced, and a waste of talent. Rumor has it that studio suits interfered, as they're wont to do, with the creative vision of the director. But that director was Guillermo Del Toro, whose next film, the visionary Pan's Labrynth, won three Academy Awards, received a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival, and got a whopping 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. This time, the studio suits politely stood out of his way.<br/><br/>Hellboy 2: The Golden Army is at once an altogether superior sequel as well as a highly entertaining standalone adventure movie. The characters are terrific, the action sequences genuinely thrilling, the comedy hits the mark (it rarely did in the first film), and the visual design is at times among the most original and unique of anything I've ever seen. Go see this movie to enjoy the craft of a great director on the rise. You don't have to have seen the first film to enjoy this one.<br/><br/>For me, this is on par with Iron Man as the summer's best action entertainment so far (The Dark Knight, of course, soon cometh). While no character in this shines as brightly as Robert Downey Jr's ultra-cool Tony Stark, the ensemble here is better, the action is just as good, and the creativity and visual imagery are terrific. When I saw the first Hellboy I didn't care if the series continued; having seen it's brawny, spunky, and imaginative sequel, I cannot wait for another installment. **** (out of five) Rated PG-13 for creepy images, action violence."

","Hellboy II missed its chance. The first film suffered form a lack of description, as the origin hinted at a deep and fun mythology to explore, but an exploration that would never come. All we got were subtle hints.<br/><br/>The sequel could have been more. It could have either taken the time to elaborate on the mythology, or it could have ignored it all together now that the origin had been told.<br/><br/>Had they gone with the latter, it would have been a fun adventure film that didn't share the same frustrations that the first one held.<br/><br/>Instead they opted to explore just a little more of the Mythology, but again, not deep enough to really establish anything the audience could mull over. It missed it's chance to get into the deep mythology of things like X-Files. Instead it hinted again, at more story that would never be told or explained.<br/><br/>That sort of thing leaves audiences a little frustrated.<br/><br/>Still, like the first, Hellboy II is a fun adventure film, like the first it has a sense of humor.

","Guillermo del Toro dropped the character John Myers from this one. It's a good thing since he was nothing more than a wet blanket. He added a new character Johann Krauss. He has an interesting look. The rest of the gang is back and they have added some more personal stories. They have to search for a crown that would control an army of indestructible machines before an evil prince can use it to destroy mankind.<br/><br/>The characters are more filled out. They are much better this time around. Their chemistry is much more settled. The del Toro style is still in effect. In fact it looks even better and more beautiful. I like this one much more than the original. And I LOVE the jumping bean elemental. It is one of the most wonderous CG creature ever. It's both beautiful and deadly. What more could you ask for? <br/><br/>The 2 hour running time does drag on, and the evil prince isn't big enough. There is too much of an incestial vibe about the evil prince. He was more creepy than scary. It's a relatively minor problem."

","From director Guillermo del Toro (Blade II, Pan's Labyrinth), the first film was worth watching, and I was surprised in a way at the time to see that there would be a sequel, and it was rated four stars, I had to see why. Basically an ancient pact was made between humans and creatures, and the demon superhero was told the story of this by his father figure Professor Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm (John Hurt), it involved three pieces of a powerful crown broken up. This pact has been broken by the appearance of evil elf Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) who is declaring war against humanity, and he plans to find the three crown pieces and unleash The Golden Army, a deadly group of fighting machines that are indestructible and will destroy the human race. The only one who can stop this from happening is the now older demon superhero Hellboy (Ron Perlman), along with his gang of other super powered chums, including flame creating Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) and Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), plus new Washington sent ectoplasmic medium Johann Krauss (Family Guy's Seth MacFarlane). Prince Nuada is so ruthless to take over the world that he even kills his own father to get his own way, but in the end of course Hellboy and the team save the day, and Liz gives Hellboy the news that he will be a father, to twins. Also starring Doug Jones as Chamberlain and Angel of Death, Jeffrey Tambor as Tom Manning and Anna Walton as Princess Nuala. Once again Perlman is likable as the both grouchy and soft sided antihero, Jones gets more time as his chum finding his own love interest that won't go anywhere, and the special effects and make up to create the large plant creatures and mechanical robot warriors among other things are fantastic, all in all it is a watchable horror fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup. Good!"

","Yeah boy it's Hellboy. I thought the first Hellboy was a boring waste of time. This new one is bad-ass not once was I bored and can I say they make elf's look like the badess of asses I've ever seen elf's. I never read the Hellboy comics so I have no clue how close to the material it is but as a movie I really dug it.<br/><br/>The plot is this Elf Prince is tired of humanities greed and he needs collect three pieces of this crown to raise the Golden Army and destroy all humans. Yeah it doesn't sound like the most original piece of art but it plays out extremely well. The only plot problems I had with this was the love angles Hellboy and his problems and Abe who just randomly falls in love with the Elf Princess. But the action oh damn that cool and you get to see Hellboy use a sword and that was just cool all on its own.<br/><br/>The characters are kind of weak but this is a pure action movie if you start looking into the characters you find out stuff like Hellboy really only cares about himself, and Liz. The creature design is so original Guillermo del Toro is a genius at creatures and making some cool ass action monster films.<br/><br/>The acting everyone did great with there role Ron Perlman is great and has some funny sarcastic lines. My personal favorite was the Elf Prince played by Luke Goss he was a great villain, plus he played one of my favorite villains from Blade 2 Nomak.<br/><br/>Overall if you haven't seen this or you hated the original Hellboy or even liked it I still high recommend this movie. This is such an improvement that I say buy only because at this point it is cheap and I see this movie as one of those movies you'll wanna watch later down the road."

","A great followup to the first Hellboy. You can see they had more money this time to better the computer graphics and costuming. Ron Perlman is terrific again as Hellboy and well supported by Selma Blair and Doug Jones. Luke Goss is great as Prince Nuada and Anna Walton is a standout as Princess Nuala. I can see big things for her ahead. The story is a lot of fun with Hellboy's deadpan humor and it's just a good film to sit down and escape with.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the fact that the combat scenes were well-filmed. In an age where many directors resort to rapid edits of close up shots to give the impression of a flurry of action resulting in nothing but a nonsensical mess, it was great to see filmed action that could actually be followed, that was nicely orchestrated and using a bit of wire work too. Good job I say.<br/><br/>For me this was the most enjoyable adaptation of a comic since probably X-Men 3."
"fwomp","6","0","1","1 February 2009"," Needed More Than Just Great Visuals...
","Before I start I need to explain something about why I rated this film the way I did. First let me say that I'm a pretty big fan of both Guillermo del Toro and the original HELLBOY film. Ron Perlman was perfectly cast in the title role and I wouldn't wish that changed for the world. The first film (also directed by del Toro) had a pretty cool story about the beginnings of Hellboy and the organization he would eventually belong to. Let me say that again, the STORY was cool. That's important, because when you get right down to it, films must have that to carry them through to audiences.<br/><br/>A friend of mine said that if I loved PAN'S LABYRINTH that I'd love this film. Well, he was wrong. I did love Pan's Labyrinth. A lot. In fact, it was probably the best film of 2006. It won BAFTA awards and three Oscars and a gaggle of others, so the critics seemed to agree with me on that point. But Hellboy II didn't fair so well. Sure, it got one nod from the Academy (for make-up, though), but little else; not that I'd expect a comic book-to-film story to garner much critical acclaim amongst the snobby elite of Hollywood-dom. But here's the thing: It could have! Take a look at things like IRON MAN and THE DARK KNIGHT and you'll see what I mean (sometimes the snobs are forced to take note of these otherwise overlooked gems whenever they're done with extreme care ...and I mean E-X-T-R-E-M-E!). So what was the problem? you may be asking. First let's look at what wasn't the problem.<br/><br/>Guillermo MUST be recognized as a visual artist. The sets and camera shots and costumes were very much on-par with what I expect from him (i.e., Pan's Labyrinth quality). The troll's market scenes were worth the price of admission alone! Stunningly dark, dreary but equally enthralling and uniquely beautiful. The Elfin lands and flashbacks were also well-done giving us a bit of history about the war between humans and elves.<br/><br/>But we need more than history and battles to make a great film. We need originality, and this is where the film fell short for me. Looking more like a side-story for THE LORD OF THE RINGS, the history of elves and men have been done ad nauseam (in both literature and film). Although del Toro tried to put a unique spin on the story by incorporating the elves as split between being nice to humans and wanting them all dead, the story really never found traction for me. This was due, in great part, by the incorporation of two love stories. One we're already aware of between Perlman's Hellboy and the firebranding Liz (Selma Blair), and the other comes as a bit of a surprise (and ends up nowhere, really). To me, del Toro could've easily excised this second love story and extended the history behind Hellboy and/or extended our understanding of why the division between the human-hating elves and the human-loving ones was so wide (I understand some of this was due to the twin elves' father, but much of it is not). We're supposed to assume (or so I assume!) that one of the elves is just flat-out evil for the sake of being evil. Not good storytelling.<br/><br/>So there you have it. I liked the film as a diversion, but I wasn't at all captivated as I was with the first Hellboy. Story, story, story. It's so important. I hope that with the next Hellboy flick (and I really hope there is another because I WILL watch it) that del Toro directs again and can give us a fresh story with the amazing visuals we've come to appreciate from him."

","""Hmmmm..."" that was my thought when I watched this film. Del Toro is a brilliant director and Hellboy is a brilliant comic. But, the film felt like it lacked a certain ""umph!"" to it, just like the first Hellboy. Del Toro did a great job with the special effect and cinematography, it was easy on the eyes. But the script and the characterization surely needed some extra works. The story didn't feel that thrilling or even that gripping. The characters are there, but you couldn't exactly you know, like touch them. Each of them basically just stand there with a barely there feeling. Overally this film felt like it's floating. That's the perfect way to describe it, just floating. Not standing firmly on the ground nor soaring in the sky. Just floats."

Still part of the same team of, Liz (Selma Blair) and Abe (Doug Jones) and with the help of a new member sent to watch over Hellboy's antics. Now this time around... Hellboy is caught in a story his earth father (John Hurt) told him, when he was just a kid. About a past war of mystics/creatures/beyond vs. the human race. Which the humans won. But the King of the Mystics was told by a little goblin that he could build him a unstoppable golden army. After the construction of the army they easily beat the humans. But the King was still troubled. So he then decided to make a truce with the humans and split up the only way to control the golden army which was a crown that could be divided into 3 pieces. Then lock/Hide the golden army forever. But enraged inside was the Prince Nuada (Luke Goss). So after years and years of hiding he decides to make his move after years of the humans ruining everything and over populating. So now its up to Hellboy to put a stop to this, and the resurrection of the golden army.<br/><br/>My Spiel: I did like Hellboy one, but it really had to grow on me to really appreciate it for all the little features. I am a big fan of comic movies and I liked how Hellboy was simply set in the old times of the German army seeking other means of weapons of a mystic/unknown nature. But this time around Hellboy 2 comes out bigger then ever. Now after director Guillermo Del Toro success of Pan's Labyrinth. They obviously let him do whatever the hell he wanted too. I know what Del Toro was trying to do in this movie was to make his own universe of mystic creatures/characters, which is obvious from the hidden market place (Expanding out like the Star Wars universe). But it reminded me to much of ""The Labyrinth"" (the movie with all the puppets). It did make this movie expand out in a new way, but I have to say it was just to over loaded and that it was just so random from time to time, like they were rushing the middle of the story and not slowing down. Then with a obvious conclusion of how this movie would end after Hellboy's earth father told the story of the golden army at the beginning, but lets not go there. I was really expecting more I have to say there weren't many scenes I could really care about or get behind, because it's obviously another stepping stone for another Hellboy expanding out with the hidden market of to many unknowns.

","Hellboy 2: The Golden Army<br/><br/>Prince Nauda, an exiled elf, tries to take control of the human world by controlling the Golden Army. To do this, he will need all three sections of the crown that controls the Golden Army. He steals the first from an auction, kills his father to get the second, and must hunt down his sister to get the third. Hellboy and his team of outcasts have to clean up the monsters that Nauda leaves behind, while tracking down Nauda before he controls the indestructible Golden Army. <br/><br/>Hellboy 2 has a decently interesting story, but it could've been better. We're given a reason why a bad guy should fight a good guy, and then the action takes off. The inventive creatures do make it more original. One problem with it is that most of the fights are won too easily. Either the bad guys win without breaking a sweat, or Hellboy wins while cracking jokes and getting angry that he lost his cigar. The movie is clichéd at times, most notable when Hellboy saves the city, but everyone hates him just because he's different. The subplots with the relationships of Hellboy/Liz and Abe/The Princess are interesting because of the men's bad relationship skills. Hellboy 2 has a decent ending, but there's nothing that separates it from the rest of summer blockbusters. <br/><br/>Hellboy 2 has good character development. Hellboy is a like able bad ass, but he doesn't come across as a stereotype. Hellboy ranks on the same level with other heroes like Hancock and The Hulk, but isn't quite as interesting as Iron Man or Indiana Jones. Prince Nauda is one of the best developed villains we've had in a long time. He's a very classy villain, and has redeemable qualities. All of Hellboy's supporting heroes are well developed. They all act very distinctly in action and have their individual quirks. <br/><br/>Hellboy 2's dialogue is acceptable most of the time, but screws up sometimes when the character's try to make jokes. There is some subtext with it, and it rarely states the obvious. Some of the jokes are funny, but most of them fall flat on their face. <br/><br/>Hellboy 2 has very unique settings. The station for the Golden Army is very unique with its grand scale and its entrance way. The troll market is interesting as well, and it is cool how much resemble real world markets, but just with different creatures and much weirder merchandise. The headquarters for the U.S. paranormal defense is much more interesting than most government buildings, with its luxurious rooms and aqua tanks for Abe. <br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro is a good director and doesn't fail. He uses the right shots to emphasize certain moments or to use the setting to their full potential. He evokes the right atmosphere all the time. He never screws up with the lighting. The cinematography is great. It takes away the feeling that we're watching a film. <br/><br/>The music helps enhance the film sometimes, but fails some of the time. It's usually over the top when it tries to be dramatic in one on one conversations. The sound editing is OK, but never fails like the music. The creature designs are the best part of the movie. All of the creatures are very original. The tooth fairies are creepy little things, and the Earth element monster is menacing in its own way. The creatures are never ridiculous or go over the top with trying to be different. The special effects are amazing and you never once doubt that they are fake. <br/><br/>The acting is acceptable. The cast doesn't give good performances, but they never go wrong. Ron Perlman does a good job of capturing the attitude of his character, but doesn't have too much chemistry with the rest of the cast. No one in the film gives a bad performance, and I think that's good enough for an action flick. <br/><br/>Hellboy 2: The Golden Army is one of the better films of 2008 so far. You could skip it, but it is a better movie than Get Smart or Prince Caspian. <br/><br/>BAKED FRESH FILM BOTTOM LINE 7/10<br/><br/>Pros: Character Development Creature Designs Settings Special Effects Directing and Cinematography<br/><br/>Cons: Fights too easily won Clichéd some of the time Music Some of the jokes fall flat on their face<br/><br/>Rating Information PG-13 1.

"davideo-2","7","0","2","15 September 2008"," Satisfying, above average comic book thriller about on a par with the original
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>It's another ordinary day for Hellboy (Ron Perlman) in the life of a half human, half demon crime fighter. He's having mild relationship problems with fire-morphing girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair) and continues to be mentored by his adoptive father Professor Bruttenholm (John Hurt.) But a new storm is brewing in the shape of Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) an immortal who's been living underground for many years. He wants to resurrect the 'golden army', so they can tear down the modern world and restore it to a world of anarchy and mayhem. He's even willing to kill his own father and turn on his sister to get it. Needless to say, Hellboy's gotta whoop some hellfire on his ass.<br/><br/>This delayed sequel to the above average 2004 comic book offering Hellboy comes complete with the same director in the shape of Gullirmo Del Toro and with him, his distinctive, quite awe inspiring flair for visual design and prosphetic make-up. Hellboy II comes to life in front of the audience as a surreal, mesmerizing fantasy, quite a visual feast for the eyes, and for more reasons than just the aforementioned. To wit, one of the most bizarre but downright funny moments of the filmic year as the big red one drowns his sorrows, with science whizz buddy Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) to the tune of Barry Mannilow's Can't Smile Without You. While other superhero movies may be trying to be all cool and trendy with the dark, Gothic look, one thing Hellboy II couldn't be accused of is taking itself too seriously, with it's lead hero quipping ""oh hell"" every two seconds and responding to such threats as ""you'll pay for this"" with lines such as ""do you take cheques?"", before his assailant unleashes a seed that gives rise to a giant monster that wants to give the Cloverfield monster some competition. It may have an apathetic plot that only serious comic book enthusiasts will really care about, but the audience were hopefully smart enough to know what to expect and enjoyed it accordingly.<br/><br/>I didn't find it quite as enjoyable as everyone else has said, to be honest, but while not better than the original (what is?) this is a sequel that's certainly on a par with it. And that's more than you can say for a lot. ***"

","Hellboy 2: The Golden Army, is a strange, beautiful beast of a story. Strange in the sense its comedy is blended strongly with captivating action sequences. Beatuful in its details and mysteriously engaging quirks, filled in with a mix of Hollywood action and fantasy.<br/><br/>Centered around the evolution of Hellboy (Ron Pearlmen) and the government agency he works reluctantly for, the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence, Hellboy 2 is a beefed up version of Hell Boy 1, with the Russians and Nazis's from the first being mercifully replaced with a stunning array of unimaginable creatures from a world within ours. And so the man in red is set with the task of destroying what is described as by the more charismatic character Abe Sapien, as the Golden Army, an unstoppable force. Surpisigly however, the golden army does not appear until the final fifth of the film, the rest is good, solid filler, including some pretty great action sequences, including a fine blend of monsters expertly wielded and created by Guillermo del Toro (director). All manner of creatures in Hellboy 2 are so detailed and visually stimulating, the screen becomes a feast of fantasy and adventure, not too mention the occasional 'Aww Crap!' However, Hellboy 2 unfortunately fails when it comes to relationship scenes and development Hellboy 1 was so desperately setting up. Guillermo del Toro once said 'I can direct someone being killed, but I can't direct a love scene.' How right he was, the love interests and Mozart-filled scenes are far too hollow and fake it feels awfully uncomfortable to watch. Ron Pearlman also lacks in these vital scenes, where he seems to collapse on seen, his face bearing an expression that desperately seeks to hear the word 'cut.' Nonetheless, Hellboy 2 is above par and gathers all the right cogs, before putting them in the right place, creating an visual feast complimeted by the mind and fantasies of a defining director."

","http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/<br/><br/>You can't seem to turn a corner these days without hearing about Guillermo del Toro's imagination. ""From the imagination of..."" is the tagline of choice used to sell all things GDT and while his movies are usually set in mythical worlds with fantastic characters, are they really all that imaginative or simply reinvented retellings of other, far more imaginative yarns? <br/><br/>From the prologue through to the end credits, GDT's latest offering, Hellboy II: The Golden Army seems to be a mixed bag of fantasy, all of which we've seen before: one part Tolkien, one part Gilliam, one part George Lucas and one part Ridley Scott. Like Lucas, GDT seems more interested in showing off his imagination than he is interested in telling an engaging story. Some scenes in HB2 play out like the Cantina sequence in Star Wars, others feel like plagiarized out takes from The Lord of the Rings, the production design looks to be borrowed from Brazil, Alien and Blade Runner. So what do I make of GDT's imagination? I'd say it's very inspired as opposed to very original.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth, although superior to HB2, also wears its influences a little bit too literally. With so much going on, PL is practically indistinguishable from the work of Lewis Carroll, Jim Henson and the Brothers Grimm. While there is little doubt Del Toro is a technically astute and visually compelling director, his brand of storytelling palatable and easy to digest, it really is a stretch to consider his work original, or truly imaginative. Whether you dissect Cronos, The Devil's Backbone or even more commercial outings such as Mimic or Blade II, Del Toro's work can best be described as a kid in a cinematic candy store, picking, choosing and recycling the work of his many influences. This isn't an entirely bad thing, and Del Toro (not unlike Quentin Tarantino) can always hide behind the time honored adage ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery."" Flattering or not, GDT proves with Hellboy 2, there is no substitute for the real thing."

","Yes appalling images, scenes, creatures and special effects of the best quality. That's what aestheticians call the horrendous beautiful. But before going further on I must issue a warning: I have never seen the first part of this series therefore my comments are focused exclusively on this second movie without any direct or indirect reference to the first one. This movie combines science and historical fiction with romanticism and even good humour sometimes in a delightful mixture. It's not common to see paranormal and supernatural creatures behaving, talking and feeling like human beings and mixing up with them in a natural way. We have seen this for instance in the Star Wars trilogy but the action in those movies was not taking place in our planet Earth not in our times like this one is. We can even see the paranormals in some funny human-like situations and telling human-like jokes though these are only mere details in the general atmosphere of the movie which is by no means funny. The story is quite credible, taking of course for granted its supernatural fiction features and aspects. It's indeed one of the best movies of this kind I have ever seen."

And I'm not a shallow guy when it comes to movies. Its not about the special effects or action. For me, a movie has to have a lot of difference to offer. Hellboy is just one of those, considering the fact that the emphasis is on action and that there are special effect throughout most of the movie. Still, that does not mean that the movie doesn't have developing as well as interesting characters, a cast that fits perfectly into the characters and a story that concerns the main plot of the movie as well as the feelings and opinions of the characters. Now, add a few good laughs, great acting and a visual extravaganza and you'll get a good movie. Guillermo, the director and writer has proved that he is capable to make a movie with a lot of dedication and sacrifice since hes turned down so many offers because of this project. If you're a fan of the comic or if you liked the movie, you'll think the same as I, that this movie is great, if you're in for the action, your also going to like it and the effects, costumes and the many places the movie takes place are something you haven't seen before.

","Sequels. So common nowadays and most of them just don't add up to their predecessors, and Helloby II: The Golden Army is no exception. Ron Perlman returns as the big, red monster hunter who was brought to Earth as a baby demon through a portal opened by Nazis. This time, he battles Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), an elf who wants to unlock the unstoppable Golden Army, which he will use to take the world back from the humans. Also, ectoplasm Johann Krauss (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is joining the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman again gives a great performance as the hero of the movie. Ex-singer Luke Goss is very impressive as the villain Prince Nuada and I hope to see more acting roles from him in future. David Hyde Pierce sadly doesn't return to provide the voice of Abe Sapien and I have to say I missed him. His voice was perfect for the character and with Doug Jones now doing it, it doesn't feel the same.<br/><br/>Just like any sequel, Hellboy II will be compared to its predecessor. Although the sequel is bigger and more creative than the first movie, I was surprised to find that I preferred the first. After seeing its trailer, I thought I would love Hellboy II and that it would be amongst my favourite films, but I was left slightly disappointed.<br/><br/>In the first movie, the amount of humour was just right to keep it going, but in the sequel the humour completely overloads. Although hilarious at some points, there's so much humour that it feels like a comedy and it doesn't work. In the opening scene we see Hellboy as a youngster being told the story of The Golden Army by Professor Broom (John Hurt) and it's unintentionally funny. The young Hellboy looks ridiculous and the only good thing about the scene, apart from the Golden Army sequence, is the short appearance from John Hurt. It's terrible as an opening scene.<br/><br/>I mentioned in my review of the first movie that I was disappointed by the villains who became uninteresting after a while. But, the sequel certainly doesn't let down in that department. Prince Nuada is a great villain and is played brilliantly by Luke Goss. Also, the strong troll Wink is spectacular along with the rest of the many creatures, all created by writer and director Gullermo del Toro. But, the medal for best creature goes to The Angel of Death.<br/><br/>The special effects in Hellboy II are quite simply spectacular. As you would assume, they're a step up from those of the first movie. They're at their most impressive during the fight between Hellboy and the elemental and also when he is battling The Golden Army. During the opening scene we see how The Golden Army came about and this is shown through animation. The animation is unexpected but it works very effectively.<br/><br/>It may not be as good as the first movie, but Hellboy II: The Golden Army is still very impressive. I give it 8/10."

","The mythical world starts a rebellion against humanity in order to rule the Earth, so as Hellboy and his team returns they must save the world from the rebellious creatures. Now, as the creatures who inhabit the spiritual realm gear-up for an all out attack on the human plane, the only one capable of saving the Earth is a tough-talking hellspawn rejected by both worlds.<br/><br/>'Hellboy 2: The Golden Army' is irrefutably a whole lot better than the first Hellboy. While I wouldn't consider the first Hellboy a bad film but let's face it, that one had its fair share of ""Bad Things That Shouldn't Be in A Movie"" but still I enjoyed it especially because of the dual blade wielding Nazi masked man Karl Ruprecht Kroenen. Now that's what I call a bonafide villain. That guy basically has the word 'evil' all over him. This one however, had a better villain (Sorry Karl), in the form of exiled Prince of the mythical world Nuada. He wants to control the legendary ""Golden Army"" and let it wreak havoc in our planet and in order to do that, he must have the pieces of the crown that controls the indestructible army.<br/><br/>Hellboy 2 had 10x the fun of the first one, the action was 10x grander and in epic scale and the work done in the costume design was superbly done. Visionary director Guillermo Del Toro isolated the use of CGI to correlate with the make-up and costume design of the monsters and the outcome is visually stunning. A new addition to the BPRD was more than welcome, ectoplasmic entity (Gasbag according to Hellboy) Johann Krauss voiced by Seth McFarlane who did a fine job voicing the character.<br/><br/>One thing that you'll notice in this film (besides the much improved storyline) is that they turned the fun-factor up a notch. Even up until now I still can't get the drunken karaoke duet of Hellboy and Abe in the tune of Barry Manilow's ""Can't Smile Without You"" out my noggin. What was Del Toro thinking?! It was so random and out of the blue. But I have to say, it worked pretty damn well. I lol'd.<br/><br/>Hellboy 2: The Golden Army is a 9."

","Ron Perlman is back and looking a little thinner as Hellboy this time around. His relationship with Selma Blair is progressed in this film and, unlike the first, hasn't been cut to shreds by a moronic film studio, leaving Guillermo Del Toro to do what he does best, creating brilliantly visual and exciting films. It's amazing what he packs in to just under two hours because afterwards I felt like I'd been shown a whole world beneath the surface of our own. The theme, one of man's betrayal on all the ancient forces, both good and evil is well told. Luke Goss, who never seems to be in any film with his own face these days, plays the evil prince brilliantly, making him both understandable and unbelievably driven at the same time, since he sees mankind as a plague on the surface of the world. The complex story telling and multiple story threads would overload most directors, but Del Toro weaves them together with great skill giving the film enormous polish. I can almost guarantee a follow up movie from this one so hopefully Hellboy 3 is not too long coming. For fans of the director this is a must and for those who like their fantasy or action films with depth and polish this is first rate. If you want a popcorn movie you can switch off to, then I would steer well clear"

He uses that in a very visual way and he uses special effects when they are needed - all bundled in a very enjoyable package. I don't know how he manages but I believe that he has a very personal way to bring forward the characters, their appearance and all the stuff around them. You just have to take a quick blink at the fantasy scenes of Pan's Labyrinth to immiediately see the similarities here... Well, I just love that. I also think that the Hellboy movies, both of them, are a lot more interesting than many of the other super comics movies that has come out. You should really give it a try but I think you'll need an open and imaginary mind here... it will not be a drama film Russia you know, it's almost all about action here. Almost..."

","After seeing Hellboy, I was looking forward to a sequel.I have come to expect nothing less than brilliance from Guillermo del Toro and I wasn't disappointed with this follow up.<br/><br/>Hellboy is funny, action packed and enchanting in equal measure.

","I liked this a lot. It's nowhere near as Gothic as the comics, and if anything, it's lighter and funnier than the first one. But although I like the comics, I think I actually prefer to see something lighter in a movie.<br/><br/>Del Toro's visual imagination (as well as his preoccupation with intricate machinery) are both served well here - there are some great critters / monsters on screen.<br/><br/>Perlman's Hellboy is simply terrific. Selma Blair is somewhat underused, as is Jeffrey Tambor - both got a substantially better deal in the original movie - but this is very much Doug Jones' Abe Sapien's movie. This man has to be the best mover in movies - Abe is so expressive despite his only moving facial feature being his mouth.<br/><br/>The story is serviceable without being stunning, and Luke Goss does a satisfactory job as villain.<br/><br/>But it's fun, and never takes itself seriously for a moment."
"funkyfry","6","0","3","17 August 2008"," Improves on the original
","I didn't care much for the original ""Hellboy"", which I watched just last week for the first time. Well the little lady dragged me out to see the sequel (isn't it supposed to be the other way around?) and I guess I'm glad because I thought it was considerably more entertaining. The villains are more compelling and interesting; in the first one they were some Nazi rejects and Rasputin, truly weird but not very interesting. In this one it's representatives of the ancient elvish or faerie race who've become discontent with human development and decided to renew an age-old war with humanity. Hellboy, ironically but predictably, is on the side of the humans instead of his fellow beasties.<br/><br/>The one thing I said I did enjoy about the first movie was Ron Perlman's performance. It's even better this time around. Selma Blair is still kind of weak, but she's in less of the film and they wisely didn't ask Rupert Evans back. Jeffrey Tambor is just as out of place in this film as he was in the first one. Johann Kraus is sort of a bizarre character that I didn't think completely worked. But basically I thought this one was funnier (the beer drinking scene with Hellboy and Abe Sapien is classic, raising the whole movie to a higher level), and also I liked the villains a lot more. I like the romance between Abe (Doug Jones) and Princess Nuala (Anna Walton), because it was dealt with in a much lighter tone than the romance in the first film, or most superhero movies for that matter. Both ""Hellboy 2"" and ""Iron Man"" showed this summer that a subtle romance can work in a superhero movie, and the audience won't feel either imposed upon or ripped off. This one is played for laughs as well as genuine sentiment, a perfectly impossible affair.<br/><br/>One small note -- it seems like with the whole scary elves thing, the director del Toro may be ""gearing up"" for the Hobbit 2 parter he's going to be doing. I've got my fingers crossed, but hopefully it'll be a lot better than this."
"pecaro0518","8","0","2","15 August 2008"," Great fun.
","Great movie! Ron Perlman is always great as Hellboy. He's funny. I like how down-to-earth and real he always seems! I love the Abe Sapien character. Very enjoyable. The special effects used for his costume are so realistic! He's such an emotional character. He reminds me of...somebody I know... I can't get over how real he looks. I'm not a big fan of Selma Blair being the girl in this movie, but that's just me. I feel like she's not warm enough. It's a very fun movie to watch. A lot of endearing moments. Great story, a lot of fun, great characters make for a great watch. The scary guys are very interesting. I think you'll like it, I liked it better than the first one!"
"rillovickwr4","8","0","2","11 August 2008"," Bigger And Better Than The First.
","If you enjoyed Hellboy, then you'll love Hellboy II. Everything is bigger, louder, more action packed. No disrespect to the first, but this may be a rare case of a sequel surpassing the original. Much like the first Hellboy, Hellboy II had that perfect mix of action, fantasy, sci-fi, drama, horror, romance, and some great comedy. Of course Hellboy was the most enjoyable character to watch, but all the characters were really portrayed well in this movie. Abe Sapien (possibly my favorite character from the first Helboy) was great, he was very relatable in this movie, he's no longer just some Fish-Guy. Liz was also easier to relate to, she seemed happier and more willing to play an active role in things. Prince Nuada is the perfect villain. He defies his superiors, he kills whoever gets in his way, and he wants to destroy humanity; what's more evil than that? Hellboy II was more of an action-adventure and less of a horror/sci-fi movie unlike the first Hellboy. It was a massive achievement in my book and i recommend it to absolutely anyone because it really did have the ultimate blend of all the big genres. One of the years best films."
"screenwriting-2","6","0","4","28 July 2008"," Better than Hellboy 1 but I'd avoid this series. Stay tuned for The Hobbit!
","Hellboy II was not what I'd hoped. I didn't really like the first one, but as a follow up to Pan's Labyrinth with lots of freedom to do as he pleased, I expected a little more from Guilermo del Torro. I think though, that you just can't merge the polished comic look he'd ""perfected"" for Hellboy with the old worn beauty of his fantasy creations without hitting that cheesy middle. Although there were several beautiful props, others were too polished and shiny or CGed and CG enhanced to look good. However, Hellboy is his pocketbook and I think he did a good enough job with it compared to most people's sellout moments. I believe it will fuel his way to a spectacular job on The Hobbit, which, if he makes more like Pan's Labyrinth, will seriously rule the school."

","True, as pointed out earlier, it's not Gone With the Wind, but DANG, what a great fantasy. This movie could not have been made without CGI, and I'm so glad it exists now - the movie just looks amazing. You have to wonder at all this stuff rattling around in Del Toro's head! Impossible to describe - you just really have to see it. Loved the wee Tooth Fairies! Ron Perlman delivers a solid performance, as always, and Doug Jones is a treat in multiple roles. Even the Prince was solid, and I didn't read good reviews about him. I really hope there will be a third installment. Beautiful and funny and unexpectedly touching, A summer hoot, and just great for what it aspires to be - a hero movie."

Ron Perlman's performance was once again outstanding as alway's, i'm glad mr del toro chose him for the part of hellboy in the first movie instead of who the Hollywood dorks wanted (vin diesel)that joker can't act his way out of a wet paper bag. just my opinion. i definitely recommend this movie to all Ron Perlman fans out there like me he rock's and is a great actor in a lead role especially he just doesn't get the credit he deserves in Hollywood. this movie is definitely Oscar worthy. go check it out for your selves"
"jdkraus","8","0","2","24 July 2008"," A great comeback!
","Is it just me or does it seem that many sequels these days are better than the original? X-Men 2, The Dark Knight, Chamber of Secrets, Prince Caspian, to name a few. ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" is one of them.<br/><br/>I liked the first Hellboy, but it didn't blow my shirt off as a great fantasy/superhero film. Hell-boy 2 however is a great comeback. The action sequences are bigger and better. The CGI is amazing. And the story is wittier.<br/><br/>I like all the good guys, and they're more alive and enjoyable to watch in this sequel. Ron Perlman as Hellboy is funny and a good hero, but he's also a character drawn between what to do with his girlfriend and sidekick Liz (Selma Blair) who has some secrets of her own. This adds a little bit of humor to the movie. Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) is not just a smart ""fish man"" who likes listening to classical music and has the unusual power to see and sense things in the past and future, but he's also a hero who has trouble putting business before pleasure from the damsel in distress Princess Nuala (Ann Walton).<br/><br/>The movie also introduces a power driven villain Prince Nuada, played wonderfully by Luke Goss and has annoying yet rather funny new sidekick Johann Krauss (voiced by Family Guy's Seth Macfarlane).<br/><br/>Unlike most action flicks, this film has a creative director and screenwriter (Guillermo Del Toro) that has the ability to bring an imaginary world to life. So, Hellboy 2 is a movie to see by fans and even for people who aren't. The only people who would not like this movie are those who either don't like fantasy or have no imagination. 8/10"

","Writer & director Guillermo del Toro's fertile imagination knows no limits. The award-winning Mexican helmed the Marvel Comics' vampire sequel ""Blade 2,"" the groundbreaking Dark Horse comics' original ""Hellboy,"" and the Oscar-winning whimsy ""Pan's Labyrinth."" Indisputably, ""Hellboy 2: The Golden Army"" surpasses its entertaining 2004 predecessor as a slickly-made serio-comic science fiction epic that pits its fireproof, scarlet-skinned protagonist against adversaries more audacious and outlandish than in the original. At the same time, our cigar-smoking, cat-cuddling hero matures in some surprising ways. The gallery of ghouls and goblins with whom Hellboy contends is both diverse and diabolical. A towering beanstalk menaces Hellboy; an Angel of Death with eyes in her vulture wings instead of her face shows him mercy, and cadaverously pale cannibalistic Tooth Fairies swarm after him like schools of ravenous piranha. Synthesize elements of ""X-Files"" with ""Men in Black,"" and you'll have an accurate idea what ""Hellboy 2: The Golden Army"" has to offer. The most intriguing creature appears in the third act. What appear to be huge boulders strewn about in a field turn out to be the body of a stony Goliath slumbering.<br/><br/>""Beauty and the Beast"" TV star Ron Perlman is both hilarious and hardheaded as the kitschy Dark Horse comic book superhero ""Hellboy."" Literally, Hellboy is half-humanoid and half-demon, but brick-red all over. While it makes matters simpler if you've seen the first ""Hellboy,"" you don't need to have seen the original to appreciate this silly but super-charged sequel. Basically, Nazi occultists with help from infamous Russian madman Grigori Rasputin spawned Hellboy during a secret experiment in World War II in the original. The U.S. Army stormed the Nazi stronghold and liberated a small red devil that Rasputin had conjured up from an unearthly portal and summoned to Earth. Professor Trevor Broom (John Hurt of ""Heaven's Gate"") adopted the cuddly demon and raised him like his own son. Since then Hellboy has grown up, but this alien life-form doesn't age like humans. Partially, he resembles the Incredible Hulk with his enormous physique; puffs on stogies like ""X-Men's"" Wolverine, lugs around a gargantuan revolver that Dirty Harry would envy and wears his devil horns filed down to look like a World War I pilot's goggles so he will blend in with the scenery. No matter what our sympathetically our hero behaves, Hellboy rarely blends in with humanity.<br/><br/>The U.S. Government has recruited the trench-coat clad Hellboy with two other mutants: his blue, amphibious, psychic sidekick Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) and his scorching babe of a girlfriend, Liz Sherman (Selma Blair of ""The Sweetest Thing"") who can transform herself into an inferno, for its ultra-secret agency, the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. According to the exposition, FDR chartered the B.P.R.D. to deal with extraterrestrial threats. No, ""Hellboy"" doesn't take itself any more seriously than its wonderful predecessor did and the charm of this sequel lies in its self-effacing humor. ""Hellboy 2"" briefly recaps Big Red's origins. Happily, although he died in ""Hellboy,"" Professor Broom reappears here in a cameo. Broom delights the 11-year old Hellboy with a bedtime tale about an ancient war between humans and elves. Ultimately, humanity won control of the cities, while the trolls assumed control of the forests. However, humanity has broken its promise and encroached on the forests with its malls and parking lots. The incensed son of Elf King Balor, pugnacious Prince Nuada (Luke Goss of ""Blade 2""), has decided to abandon the truce between mankind and the elves. Initially, Nuada's father Balor (Roy Dotrice of ""Nicholas and Alexandra"") had assembled a golden army of mechanical warriors that ""never knew hunger and could not be stopped,"" but Balor kept this invincible army in check, much to his son's chagrin.<br/><br/>A peerless martial arts expert, Nuada plans to massacre humanity with his father's long dormant golden horde. Before he can mobilize the army, Nuada murders his helpless father in cold blood without a qualm while his incredulous twin sister Nuala (Anna Walton) watches in horror. Nuada's Achilles heel is that anything that happens to his twin sister can exact a similar toll on him. Nuada embarks on a scavenger hunt to locate three parts of a magic crown that will enable him to command these mechanical combatants. Meanwhile, FBI liaison to the B.P.R.D., Agent Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor of ""City Slickers'), enlists ""ectoplasmic"" but anonymous Professor Johann Krause (James Donn) to supervise Hellboy and company. Krause is as bizarre a character as they come. Dressed in a deep sea diver's outfit, he never shows his face, and speaks with a clipped, cartoon-like German accent. When Hellboy isn't clashing with either Nuada or his fantastic monsters, our hero wrestles with an even harder rival, his temperament girlfriend Liz who harbors a secret that will forever alter Hellboy's life.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, the imposing Perlman dominates this lighthearted but larger-than-life fantasy, and the scene with Hellboy as a child gives more depth than usual to such a character. Furthermore, Hellboy has to run a gauntlet of some of the most visually impressive monsters of the summer. Indeed, Hellboy gets his butt kicked before he kicks butt. As the malignant Nuada, Luke Goss drips evil; Goss resembles the old rock star Edgar Winter. Meanwhile, Jeffrey Tambor provides welcome comic relief as the bureaucratic Manning. Altogether, ""Hellboy 2: The Golden Army"" qualifies a real supernatural sizzler with a sense of humor!"
"Arenarocker05","8","0","1","22 July 2008"," Visually Stunning!
","I enjoyed this film so much more than the first one. Guillermo Del Toro is brilliant when it comes to special effects and creature concepts for the atmosphere of a story, which now brings me to my next point. The movie itself was great visually, but the story was something we have seen many times before; an evil warlord or entity returns from the dead or from exile to destroy humanity and it is up to the good guys to put an end to the destruction.<br/><br/>The movie has plenty to keep you entertained; monsters left and right, humor, and plenty of action. It surpassed the original by far because the first Hellboy didn't blow me away as this movie did. In my opinion from the first Hellboy, the villains sucked, acting was mediocre, and it lacked the action to keep one interested. However the villain (Prince Nuada) in Hellboy 2 was bad ass. And also the giant ""Cloverfield"" monster was cool as well, even though it is not the actual ""Cloverfield"" monster, but it looked like it for a second.<br/><br/>Anyway, I must say this is a really good summer for films adapted from comic books. I mean come on; the past few years have sucked when you look back disaster films like ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer."" Now we've got great movies to clean up the mess they left behind like ""Iron Man"", ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""The Dark Knight"", and finally we have ""Hellboy 2: The Golden Army."""

","I liked the original Hellboy, which is odd because I only heard about it after it had been ported to DVD. Wishing I could have seen it on the big screen there was little option when I got wind that Del Toro was fashioning a second movie after the red devil with the rock fist. I also liked Pan's Labyrinth, which was released shortly after another favorite of mine was in the theater, Mirrormask. Both dealing with depth of fantasy that were rich and dark, some of this feeling spilled over into the latest Hellboy movie. Del Toro brought much of the feel of Pan's Labyrinth into this movie. As in many movies of today, plot development is simple and age old: Good against Evil. Someone always wants to take over the world for some personal or obscure reason. Given that, the movie has a solid script and some interesting but not all unforeseen surprises. I have to admit, one sequence involving a locker of beer, a Barry Manilow tune and a heightened sense of warm fuzzies had me in stitches. The down side of that was that the Barry Manilow song was retained in my head for DAYS after. The reality of the creatures, the ferocity of the Elves, the constant bombardment of battles and day to day issues just make this movie a great summer popcorn flick, and even worth the price of an evening theater viewing. As a side note, seeing Del Toro will be manning the helm of the next addition of Tolkien movies, I will be watching the boards on the progress he and Jackson do with The Hobbit with great interest."

And the fact that director Guillermo Del Toro used as least CGI as possible very much entered the movie in a league of its own.<br/><br/>But the problem is the storyline.<br/><br/>Yes, the story was in-depth and very chilling and daunting at some point and not to mention very comedic and romantic...but it gets a very ""soap opera""-ish feeling after a while. I mean, someone gets pregnant, Abe fell for Princess Nuala, the whole sacrifices at the end of the movie, Liz's choice between Hellboy's life or the fate of Earth, and relationship that doesn't work out.<br/><br/>Okay, some people might like it. But others (Hellboy and Del Toro die hard fans) may be expecting more than that (or maybe a bit less of the drama).<br/><br/>But still, I must say I LOVED it and gave it a 9/10...sorry, but I just had to take away that one star."

As it stands, the more I watch these comics made movies, the more interested in the comic I become.<br/><br/>Those of you familiar with del Toro's work will quickly recognize the ""Pan's Labyrinth"" styling. In fact, I believe that that styling is really what makes this movie good.<br/><br/>Aside from the dialogue, which is mediocre at best, the visual aspects to this film are quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Some of those other companies who make movies based on large green cgi hulks ought to take a lesson and realize that you can do a lot with talented costume designers who can actually make something look believable with foam and prosthetic...<br/><br/>There were some very good laugh moments, there were some very good groan moments. Thankfully, the characters had shown a bit of growth from the last one, and were now more comfortable with one another.<br/><br/>The story was a simple one. It was a mix of Labyrinth (The Jim Henson/David Bowie one), Stardust, 5th element, Return to Oz, and a few other types of movies that those into this genre can easily relate to, humbly melded together to create this quaint little tale.<br/><br/>All and all a slightly more sophisticated popcorn film then the usual fare. I say more sophisticated because of the care and beauty that goes into del Toro's films that you rarely see anywhere else.<br/><br/>Of course, the critics complain and the the ""true"" fans hate, but my wife and I had a very nice time."
