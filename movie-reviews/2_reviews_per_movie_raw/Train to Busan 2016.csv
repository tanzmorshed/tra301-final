The only difference with this train ride is I didn't want it to stop. It has a brilliant script, fantastic effects plus a very good choice of cast and acting. It also has a 'credible' plot (as credible as you can get with the zombie genre). Many of the scenes will stay with me for a long time. I hear that Hollywood want to do a remake of it. It will be interesting if it will be done as well as this. I thoroughly recommend this very refreshing and fast paced film. Get a ticket and enjoy the ride!"

I'm rather into zombie films and sitting here with it having just finished, I feel this is probably the best I've seen by far. I put off watching this due to the trailer and some slightly unsure reviews but I wish I hadn't. It's better than it looks in the trailer. Most films have moments that you think could have been a little better but anything like that is just minor and doesn't take away from the overall experience of the film. This director certainly knows how to build suspense and uncomfortable situations. I already know I'll watch it again and again"
"3xHCCH","10","250","448","5 September 2016"," More Than Just a Zombie Film
","This new Korean film ""Train to Busan"" is certainly earning a lot of positive word of mouth and box office success since its debut in the Midnight Screenings section of this year's Cannes Film Festival.<br/><br/>The central character is Seok-woo, a man stressed out with problems about his investments business and his divorce. His 9-year old daughter Su-an, feeling neglected, requests her father to bring her to Busan the next day to see her estranged mother. Seok-woo could not say no.<br/><br/>On the same train to Busan as Seok-woo and Su-an, a lady passenger with a bite wound on her legs, collapses and turns into a zombie. As she bites another person, that next person would also turn into a zombie and so on. Panic ensues on the train, and as everyone eventually discover along the way that the same zombie frenzy was true for the rest of the country. The fight to survive is now on.<br/><br/>This film was one exhilarating roller-coaster ride from beginning to end. The zombies and their attack scenes were very well-executed with a combination of practical and computer-generated effects. These monsters were very fast-moving and relentless in their quest for human flesh. We hear people around us gasp and shriek with shock as we see these zombies pile up in droves and hordes, crash out of windows and barrel through doors. We breathlessly hang on to the edge of our seats the whole ride.<br/><br/>Of course, what Korean film does not have a good dose of melodrama? The father-daughter dynamic between Seok-woo and Su-an is front and center. But aside from them, we also meet a cast of supporting characters on the train whose fates we will be following for the rest of the film. These include a burly man with his pregnant wife, a teenager with his girlfriend and his baseball team, a haughty businessman, two elderly sisters and a homeless man, among others. We get just enough introduction about who they are for us to care about what happens to them.<br/><br/>Gong Woo played the flawed lead character Seok-woo very well. He was able to convincingly portray the development of this uncaring apathetic guy into a hero we could all root for to get through this crisis alive. He was as good in the weepy dramatic scenes as he was in the swashbuckling action scenes. This actor has come a long way since his breakout role as lead star of the TV romantic comedy series ""The Coffee Prince"" back in 2007.<br/><br/>Kim Su-an is only 10 years old but she had already been acting in films for five years now. She is the dramatic core of this film as the daughter desperately reaching out to her jaded father. As a child actress, she held her own impressively among this cast of veterans with her heartfelt portrayal. Who would have thought that the sad little song she wanted to sing for her father would resonate so much?<br/><br/>Ma Dong-seok is charismatic as Sang-hwa, a devoted husband and selfless fighter. We see him first as some sort of comic relief only, which made the audience warm up to him. Later, we would discover how much more his character was able to do and give for others, and loved him more. His pregnant wife Seong-kyeong was played by acclaimed Korean indie film actress Jung Yu-mi, conveying strength in her delicate condition. <br/><br/>Another actor of note is Kim Eui-sung, who was totally hateful in his role as the selfish Yong-suk. In total contrast to Sang-hwa, Yong- suk was a man only thought of himself alone, not caring that he actually put a lot of other characters directly into harm's way.<br/><br/>Ahn So-hee (as Jin-hee) and Choi Woo-shik (as Young-guk) were in there to inject some teenage romantic angst into the film. They were relatively lightweight performers who were probably included just because they looked cool. That scene when Young-guk encounters his baseball teammates-turned-zombies was very well-conceived by the writers. <br/><br/>People may dismiss as ""just"" being a zombie film, but it is the drama of human relationships and interactions that rises above the horrific and thrilling carnage. Director Yeon Sang-ho's first two feature- length films (""The King of Pigs"" and ""The Fake"") were both animated films exploring the bleak side of human nature. With his first live action directorial effort, Yeon has created a complete film masterpiece with ""Train to Busan."" Highly recommended! 10/10."

"ctowyi","8","198","372","4 August 2016"," Board this train!
","This is one fantastic train ride. I love the creative ideas and the economical character setups. No need for too much heavy top-down moralization. This is a straight-up disaster flick with zombies coming in swarms from all directions. So we already know the archetypal characters - the coward, the brave one, the pregnant one, the youth in love, the heroic one and so on. The fun is in seeing which one will die first and who will live. This train is loaded with some colorful characters. <br/><br/>Putting 80% of the action on a bullet train didn't constraint the wealth of inventive ideas one bit as the commuters escape the crazy zombies from car to car. The momentum is terrific and I kept marveling at all creative problem-solving; some I have never seen before. The character arc of the main actor from narcissistic anti-hero to titular hero is very potent and what injects the narrative with much forward power. Love the subtext of class and government hypocrisy, class division, vileness of human nature and the dreaded herd mentality. Ya ya ya, I know the movie never delves too deep into them. Because that would rob the movie of its relentless momentum. I think Paul Greengrass who made Jason Bourne needs to study the cinematography here. You don't need to do split-second cuts and shake the camera to make the audience feel in-the-moment. The action set-pieces are so well choreographed that I understand and see everything. <br/><br/>Straits Times (my local papers) said the last act is disappointing with the train derailing, crashing into some cliché-obstacles and careening through melodramatic territory. Hello? This is Korean cinema - melodrama is expected and in this case welcomed with open arms. IMHO the first two acts are so explosively fun and rollicking thrilling that it practically earned its melodramatic ending. Heck! I was nearly tearing up. <br/><br/>This is one of the most entertaining and unpretentious zombie movies I have seen in a while. This is one train you need to board."

All the exciting moments end with a climax that's fit for a movie. The few minutes during each break for audience to catch their breath is not boring or wasted, perfectly used for characters development. I don't understand why someone commented the last 30 minutes is not as good. I find each climax better in the next.

On board the train with passengers of various social stratification and personalities, the father struggles to survive along his daughter this zombie apocalypse and reach their destination safely.<br/><br/>In this mash of political stew and this test of humanity, the audience gets to experience a fun horror ride in which is cleverly depicted to represent the scares when needed, the emotions when needed and even the funny moments when needed. I mainly can take on the movie the stereotypical representation on the villain character and its fate, yet beside the fact and taking in consideration the proper performance by the whole cast, great cinematography and the talented directing, the film ends up being a great experience of the zombie sub-genre."

The movie disproves his early maxim that everyone should look for themselves in no uncertain terms. The selfish coward corporate train manager and his refusal to help others is given its due. And in the end, humanity wins in the perfect if hopeful ending. Movie is fun, fresh and still manages to be a good zombie/outbreak movie showing end of the world of sorts, in a way much higher budget Hollywood crapies can only dream to achieve.

"hailander-01340","10","121","252","9 October 2016"," An overall excellent movie
","A friend of mine recommended this movie. In his words, it would be ""a kickass Korean zombie flick"", so naturally i went into this movie expecting another generic, dumb, goofy zombie splatter film. Boy, was I in for a surprise!<br/><br/>First of all, the acting is spot on. All the actors are doing a tremendously great job, but for me, little Soo-an Kim totally nails it in one of the best child actor performances I have ever seen. The zombie actors are also truly exceptional and they manage to spook you, without having to rely on heavy prosthetics and rotting flesh.<br/><br/>Secondly, the cinematography is amazing. Although the whole story is taking place during daytime, the film manages to make you feel claustrophobic and constantly nervous without having to rely on cheap tricks such as jump scares or low lighting conditions. The cuts are seamless, the colours great and, though different from Hollywood standards, it is a generally really good looking movie.<br/><br/>What really captured me though in this film was the drama. In this genre the characters are usually very generic and one dimensional. Though this flick is, at first, not so different in this aspect, as the story carries on we witness the shifting between the dynamics of the characters, we see their personalities evolve and change, we find out about their motives, their relationships and the depths they would go for their loved ones. I personally found myself very emotionally invested to the characters (which might be due to the great acting performances),I was actively routing for them and was really moved by the movie's finale.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong though. This is not some melodramatic drama flick. It is still an awesome zombie apocalypse movie. It is fast paced, it is action-packed, it is gory, it is tense and terrifying and it will keep you at the edge of your seat. It is also original, it doesn't play around and will surely satisfy even the hardcore fans of the genre. However, it is also a film you will remember for its awesome story and characters and for being an overall great movie. 10/10"

"BA_Harrison","9","18","31","18 September 2016"," First class all the way.
","Train To Busan can be summed up in four words: zombies on a train. But what director Sang-ho Yeon does with this simple premise is extremely impressive, giving the somewhat tired zombie genre another jolt of life.<br/><br/>Using his confined location—a packed intercity train—to maximum effect, Yeon expertly ramps up the tension, the living gradually whittled down to a handful of passengers fighting for survival against the slavering undead (a bit like taking the last train home from Waterloo on a Saturday night).<br/><br/>There are some great ideas present that really add to the excitement, such as the zombies getting confused whenever the train enters a tunnel and swarming in numbers to break through barriers (with special effects easily on a par with those in World War Z). Surprisingly, the gore quotient is very low, but with such a rollicking pace, the lack of blood really isn't an issue.<br/><br/>Perhaps a touch too long at almost two hours to be perfect, Train to Busan is nevertheless one of the better zombie films to come out in recent years. Highly recommended. 8.5/10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb."

"Troy_Campbell","8","91","197","12 August 2016"," Adds a lot of spark to the zombie genre.
","This lively South Korean zombie flick arrives in Oz with a limited release, which is a pity as it's a riotous adventure filled to the brim with action, gore and damn interesting story beats. Like all good films within this subgenre, the narrative is rife with metaphors about modern day issues (parent-child connections, corporate greed, human interaction, etc) but it also provides a compelling survival plot when taken at face value. The core relationship between Yoo Gong's self-centred businessman and his quiet, emotionally-neglected 9-year-old daughter (Soo-an Kim – a tour de force) is riveting as it gets put through the wringer, never feeling anything less than authentic. There are spurts of melodrama, however, that induce the odd unintentional chuckle, whilst a select few from the supporting cast play up their stereotypes – love-struck school girl, despicable scaremonger, muttering homeless man – a little too much. Sang-ho Yeon directs with unabashed gusto, pumping up tension and thrills though a string of adrenaline-pumping set pieces, an amazing train-station sequence that turns from hopeful to deadly being a particular high point. The undead are suitably grotesque and enjoyably expendable, their physical movements a mix between the 28 Days Later mode of rapid flesh-eaters and the herky-jerky twitches of J-horror ghosts, although the rules for how quickly someone becomes ""infected"" seems to vary depending on plot requirement. It doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the zombie genre, but with a bunch of exhilarating set pieces and a willingness to kill off anyone at anytime, Train to Busan certainly adds a whole lot of spark."

"kanyeezy-28832","7","88","201","23 July 2016"," Challenge of Korean blockbuster, and it succeeded quite well
","Making zombie blockbuster movies outside of Hollywood is not an easy task. Money is the biggest problem, of course. Since it takes a lot of money, success should be guaranteed before making a movie is decided. However, because there are no other precedents, you can't tell whether it's going to succeed or not. This bad cycle kept Korean directors from making zombie blockbusters. This tells how bold movement it was to make 'Train to Busan'. This movie was destined to be 'hit' or 'flop' and it turns out to be 'hit'. Then, this gives a food for thought. What made this Korean zombie blockbuster movie which is definitely unfamiliar to Korean people successful? Ironically, the secret lies in familiarity. Let's take a look at this movie. Yes, it has zombies, but is this movie all about them? No. Unlike 28 days later or resident evil, this movie actually doesn't care about zombies that much. Zombies are not explained much. Their origin, their ability, cure for zombiesThese are the things that are not being handled well in the movie. In this movie, zombies are just tools to represent 'threats'. The main theme of this movie is about how people react to threats. Selfishness, altruism, violence, love and much more are being depicted in this movie. And Korean people are quite accustomed to these elements. When directors mix these elements well, then the movie becomes a hit, just like this one. However, this movie still has some downsides too. Acting of Jin-hee is quite unbearably bad and the character Yong-suk (who keeps trying to sacrifice others to save himself) had gone way too far. Yes, I can get mad at bad guys but I don't want to get annoyed at them. Also, getting annoyed gets worse when it is not properly resolved as this movie does. Overall, this is a quite well-made movie, though it still has some bad moments. I believe this movie will be a new beginning for Korean blockbusters. And I recommend you to watch this movie to stay alert for rise of Korean movies."

","This movie stinks. Here's the setup: a man works too much and has a daughter, and they're going to take a train to see the girl's mother. Got it? Good, time to get to the action.<br/><br/>Zombies show up. The only kind of cool part of the whole movie is the creepy way zombies tend to come pouring out of windows and doors. That's seriously the highlight. People stand around like slack-jawed cattle waiting to be slaughtered. They watch people get eaten alive, with expressions on their faces that suggest they're instead looking at somebody being mildly rude at the dinner table. The undead monsters blessed with superhuman speed are able to kill rooms full of people seemingly within a minute or two. However, when they try to kill one of the main characters, they're about as dangerous as a chihuahua with teeth made of bubblegum. Doubly so if they go against the big cool guy, who can beat down train cars full of zombies without breaking a sweat. Anybody bitten by a zombie turns into a bloodsucking monster within 10-30 seconds, unless they're a main character or antagonist, in which case it takes forever so that it's DRAMATIC.<br/><br/>This movie has the good old fashioned 'let those people die, because maybe they're infected' cliche. Except it doesnt make ANY SENSE because like I just said, people TURN WITHIN 30 SECONDS.<br/><br/>One by one the protagonists sacrifice themselves heroically, and the bad guy tries to kill them for actually, literally no reason. Also the zombies can't see in moderately dim lighting conditions, and they can't catch up to a lady who is about 7-8 months pregnant.<br/><br/>At the end, the little girl and the pregnant woman are the only ones alive. They're about to get sniped for no good reason, until the girl sings the song she wanted to sing for her dad I guess. Everybody's heart strings get horribly tugged. Or if they're like me, they thank god that it's over. Frustrating, inconsistent, illogical, cliche, completely lacking in tension. It's bad."

","We're leaving (leaving) on that Zombie Train to Busan (leaving on the undead train).<br/><br/>Use to seeing Korean horror films about ghost, but Zombies!? This was refreshing.<br/><br/>So this neglectful dad tries to make amends with his daughter by riding with her on the train (which she wanted to go by herself) to take her back to his ex-wife. Lucky for both of them as a zombie outbreak happens while their on the train. Now, their only hope for survival is to make it to the Busan stop.<br/><br/>You really can't go wrong with a Zombie movie. It's rare that I've have seen one that I did not like. Train to Busan is definitely a good one too. Its filled with interesting characters. Other than the father daughter team, the train is also occupied by a pregnant women and her Macho and humorous husband, a school girl and her baseball playing boyfriend and some homeless wonderer who saw the outbreak first hand, just to name a few. <br/><br/>The social commentary speaks on what you are made of as an individual and as a society with the best and the worse coming out of everyone during this crisis.<br/><br/>I loved how relentless and aggressive the Zombies were. More like 28 days later than Romero. The special effects do get a little cartoony with zombies that seem to come form nowhere piling over one another like poring cereal into a bowl or something, but it does give you that man, these guys are screwed feel. Train to Busan focus on the idea that the walking dead sense you through sight and sound. If they can not see you or hear you they have no way of knowing your living flesh is a foot away from their hunger. It made for some cleaver obstacles when a group of passengers have to maneuver through train cars filled with zombie passengers (Sounds like the next game in the Resident Evil franchise).<br/><br/>Also found it interesting that no zombies were shot in this picture. I don't know how Korean gun control laws work, but I can assume it's strict enough that the story would make no sense if someone on the train just happen to have one for zombie killing (unlike an American movie in which the unborn child having a gun would be fine so long as it moved along the story). Definitely a rarity in a Zombie picture and it worked.<br/><br/>It's Action packed, it's humorless, with incredible looking zombies and a cast of characters so lively you give a crap what happens to them in the end. <br/><br/>http://cinemagardens.com/"

The spicy part was all over the place in the form of slavering hordes of really stressed out zombies who probably need to chill. There was plenty of action and distinct rounded characters in some big scenes.
The sweet was the truly tragic note to the finale which, like in The Host really grabbed you in the feels. Kim Soo An is a great actor and I hope they didn't do something nasty to make her cry like that."

","This is my first review on here, and I was so blown away by this film that I just had to come on here right after viewing it to share my experience! First off, all I can say is WOW! My heart is still racing and I still have tears in my eyes (and I honestly RARELY cry in response to any film)! The characters are so well-developed and right from the beginning (and literally to the very LAST moment of the film) I genuinely felt for these characters and felt like I was actually with them, experiencing a huge range of emotions from fear to sadness to even some funny moments, all which are very sincere and portrayed by top- notch acting. I'm so tired of all the bad, cheesy, cheap movies on Netflix, but after reading so many great reviews of this film I decided to give it a try - and boy am I impressed! This is not your typical zombie film - Hollywood, please take note of this - THIS IS HOW A ZOMBIE MOVIE should be! It explores so much more than just ""zombies"" - it shows what is at the core of humanity and society; it explores ethics and what people will do in a crisis and to fight til the end to survive - all without going too deep or being too corny. The cinematography is incredible and the acting is really what blew me away - especially the little girl - I admit she won my heart and I was crying along with her at the end when her father sacrifices himself for her and the pregnant woman. If a film can truly make its audience care so much for its characters like this film does (kudos to the director!), it ups the tension even more and we feel a true connection to these characters - WOW! That is a RARE but fabulous thing! Please watch this movie - even people who don't like ""zombie"" movies will love it - perfect mix of horror, drama, and suspense! I love how the director used a very claustrophobic atmosphere and whittled it down to being even more claustrophobic - amazing! You will not be disappointed! I was glued to the screen the entire time while watching this! The best zombie movie ever - and don't let the subtitles turn you off - it is not overly dialogue heavy and the subtitles do not distract from the film! What a thrill ride! I'm still on the edge of my seat! So impressive, especially it being a foreign film - that might turn some people off but give it a try - you will not be disappointed! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I'm a huge horror junkie and it is a rare thing to have a horror film affect me so much - but this is more than just a ""horror"" film - it connects its audience with its characters in such a way that you actually feel like you are on this train to Busan right along with them! I can honestly say that I felt cramped, claustrophobic, and on the edge of my seat the entire time watching this (and I admit I LOVED it! What a ride)! I'm just so overly happy that I finally found an amazing film on Netflix! ""Train to Busan"" is by far the best film I've seen this past year! Simply blown away. :-D"

Along their journey, the non-infected passengers have to fight the zombies and the selfishness of the human being. <br/><br/>""Busanhaeng"", a.k.a. ""Train to Busan"", is one of the best zombie films ever made.

The direction is amazing and the action scenes are fantastic. The screenplay is melodramatic but also attractive; the beautiful cinematography and special effects and make-up are highlighted by the perfect edition. The cast has good performance but the girl Soo-an Kim is impressive and steals the show. We hope Hollywood industry does not destroy this little gem with the usual remakes.

"Argemaluco","9","15","32","11 December 2016"," Busanhaeng
","Once more, South Korea borrows a concept of North American cinema, and brings us a lesson on how things should be done. After many years of generic and repetitive zombie movies (with a few honourable exceptions), we finally have a film with authentic substance, well developed characters and a positive and humanist message which transcends the horror of the zombie infestation. However, thinking about it well, the secret might be the fact that Busanhaeng isn't really a horror film, but an electrifying adventure in which the main danger (but not the only one) is the zombies... a similar strategy to the one of World War Z (with echoes of Snowpiercer), but less focused on the global disaster, and more dedicated to cultivate interesting characters whose challenges and relationships form the dramatic core of the film. Besides, Busanhaeng isn't as bloody as it seems while we are watching it. In retrospect, it surprised me to realize that there are almost no firearms, a bullet is rarely shot and the blood flow is kept to the minimum... nothing of ""head shots"" or dismemberments, and barely a few bites with minimum gore. However, the impact of the attacks is undeniable, due to Yeon Sang-Ho's brilliant direction, whose ingenuity doesn't know any limits in order to orchestrate chases, escapes and situations of a big danger which flow organically without damaging the logic and realism of the premise. The characters of Busanhaeng cover a democratic range of ages, occupations and personalities: the financial executive who is only worried about saving his little daughter; a working class couple with a baby on the way; two students who are in love, even though they don't want to recognize it until their lives are in danger; an indigent who is more cunning than the other ones imagined; and, of course, the obligatory ""corporative villain"". Despite so many sub-plots, Busanhaeng never gets confusing, and much less boring, because it continually finds new ways to create suspense about the destiny of the characters. Nevertheless, to be fair, my only complaint against this movie is that unexpected decision which concludes the second act, in which one of the characters does something quite absurd I didn't find credible or justified. But, well... the consequences of that twist deliciously complicate the situation, and I still give Busanhaeng an enthusiastic recommendation as a zombie film which is tense, hugely entertaining and even deep, with a solid social commentary about the war of classes and personal responsibility which is rarely found in this type of cinema. In summary, Busanhaeng is the best zombie film I have seen in various years, and another sample of Korean talent improving North American formulas on the basis of creativity and emphasis on the humanity of the characters, regardless of the circumstances they go through. That's a valuable lesson for any cinematographic genre... but it works better in fantastic cinema, in which a strong connection to reality is indispensable."

","Whenever I watch movies in the theater, I almost always choose one which is either on IMAX or 3D. My reason is that, Since I am spending my hard earned money to watch a movie on the big screen, it might as well be worth it or I'd rather wait for it on DVD or watch it online. Aside from that, since there have been a lot of awesome TV shows lately, which are written with more cliffhangers, I found that whenever I watch a 2D movie in the cold and comfy theater, I get sleepy and sometimes fall asleep before the end. Blame it on my short attention I guess. The other day I was at the mall and sort of got stranded because of a sudden downpour. And I decided to pass the time by watching a movie. I tried out the Director's Club theater at the new S. Maison beside the Conrad Hotel,and I ofted to watch the Korean movie ""TRAIN TO BUSAN"" because of the nice trailer that I saw on my Facebook feeds. I'll be honest, that at first I thought it was a bad decision, because I didn't know that the movie was not in English, and I thought that I would definitely fall asleep because I was so comfy in the cold temperature and lazy boy seats. But the movie was so THRILLING and ENGAGING that I was thoroughly entertained until the end, even though it was Korean and only English subtitles. Zombie plots in shows have been so common lately that I have lost interest in watching shows with zombies themes, such as ""The Walking Dead"" which was okay the first few seasons, but I feel was later on just been too violent and worn out.This movie, ""TRAIN TO BUSAN"" was a surprisingly fresh and pleasant to watch. I was thrilled and engaged in it until the ending. I recommend watching it, even if I rarely don't do movie reviews or movie recommendations. For me it was definitely money well spent. So much so, that I am thankful that I got stranded in the mall that day. the all actors and actress are good! good job to the script writers and directors and staffs,.. I LIKE IT!!

The zombies are reminiscent of World War Z. In fact, it might as well be a small part of that franchise. The characters are well-drawn. They are memorable. There are about ten good characters.

","Talking to a fellow IMDber about what his top film of 2016 was,I got told about a tantalising Korean Horror epic that he had seen at a film festival. Deciding to hold a 2016 Horror double bill viewing this weekend (with the other being the gritty Brit zombie title The Girl with All the Gifts) I booked a ticket for the Busan train.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Putting all his attention on work, Seok-Woo barely sees his daughter Su-an.Sick of hardly seeing her dad,Su-an demands Seok-Woo to take her to Busan,so that Su-an can spend her birthday with her mum/his ex- wife. Taking it on the chin,Seok-Woo books the tickets for him and his daughter.

Drawn away from Anima for his live action debut,Yeon & cinematographer Hyung-deok Lee brilliantly close the passengers to the chaos on board with ultra-stylish claustrophobic shots,which look from above at the limited room the passengers have for zombie-free air. Mounting up the zombies,Yeon brilliantly chews practical,in-camera effects with CGI shrieks,howling from Yeon keeping the gore to a minimum,to instead carve out an anxiety-drench Horror atmosphere,spun from the disturbing fast/slow spider-like movement of the undead. <br/><br/>Watching the world die out as they drive by,the screenplay by Yeon eats up spectacular horror set-pieces with precisely hit personal human tragedy. Taking pit stops on the way to the poetic final destination,Yeon rolls the zombies in with piles of them darting all over the empty stations,with the unlucky pick-ups the train makes leading to some tasty shocks. Looking in at every carriage,Yeon cleverly uses the sweet drama between Seok Woo and Soo-an (played by the fantastic Yoo Gong and Soo-an Kim) as a foundation to keeping a close watch at how everyone on the other carriages fight to keep the zombie train on track."

To be fair on that part, these were all newly infected people, so there was no decay to show.<br/><br/>What I found interesting about this, as it comes from a culture where honor and class are so essential to the daily lives of the Koreans, that it lent another layer of story to the movie.

That changes with TRAIN TO BUSAN, a Hollywood-feel film that owes more than a debt of inspiration to WORLD WAR Z in its depiction of fast, feral zombies that amass into a CGI-animated crowd on occasion.<br/><br/>This film is straightforward enough, with a simple premise: zombies on a train. And yet it also happens to be thoroughly gripping, exciting, and indeed excellent, thanks to the skill of director Yeon Sang-ho who is known for his animated features like KING OF PIGS. The reason this film succeeds where others fail is down to the characterisation, which is superb for a straight horror tale. The characters are realistic, well-drawn, and appealing, and there's plenty of sentiment while at the same time the film narrowly avoids falling into melodrama.<br/><br/>This is a visceral journey that has the viewer on the edge of his or her train seat for much of the running time. It starts off eerie and foreboding and then builds a momentum that never flags right up until the end. The CGI effects are pretty good although occasionally weak, but that doesn't matter a jot when everything else is so well portrayed. The actors impress as always in Korea, putting tons of energy and heart into their performances, and as an action-horror film this is difficult to surpass. I enjoyed every moment."

","I heard about this movie from a friend who told me about and said is very good. This is perhaps the first Korean Zombie movie, the whole movie except the first 15 minutes is so action pack and make you edge of your seat. <br/><br/>Like most zombie movie, they don't really explain the origin of outbreak and the outbreak was happens so quick, I think this outbreak is the quickest I ever see in any TV show or movie. <br/><br/>If you love zombie movie and show, this won't be disappoint to you as well. This movie more realistic show what would human behave and you will see worst of their form in this movie and also some of best form. This is good balance intake."

","The zombie bits were good but unfortunately the bits in between and at the start were some pretty average family drama cliché.

The self centered baddie is a pretty easy to loath character, so well done on that, the effects were nice, the zombies looked great, sound was great, cinematography was a bit 'digital camera', but passable. They laid the syrup sentimentality on with a shovel and it really drags the movie down, making a 6 instead of an 8."

"tomgillespie2002","7","10","21","6 August 2017"," In a time of zombie overkill, Train to Busan still manages to feel fresh
","Train to Busan, Sang-ho Yeon's hugely successful South Korean zombie movie, may just be the most effortlessly enjoyable action movie to feature the brain-hungry undead in years. Taking inspiration from the maestro who created the 'zombie' we know and love today, the late, great George A. Romero, as well as Danny Boyle's faster and scarier flesh-eaters, it's a wonderfully constructed and nail- bitingly tense piece, which manages to mix action, horror and a bit of family drama into two hours of pure entertainment. It also finds time to deliver a message amidst the carnage, and one that is perhaps more relevant than ever in these unpredictable times. In the most hopeless of situations, we must ultimately look out for one another if we are to stand a chance of surviving. Train to Busan condemns those who are willing to sacrifice others to save their own necks.<br/><br/>Workaholic fund manager Seok-woo (Yoo Gong) is the kind of father who always seems to be on his phone at important family events. Divorced and single, he occasionally looks after his young daughter Soo-an (Su-an Kim) in the apartment he shares his mother, but pays such little attention to the girl that he buys her a Nintendo Wii for her birthday, forgetting that he got her the same present the previous year. What she really wants for her birthday is to see her mother in Busan, but Seok-woo is so busy at work that he is unable for find the time to accompany her on the 2 hour round-trip. After taking some advice from his mother, he eventually agrees. They arrive at the train station safe and sound, but it's clear that something isn't quite right. Police and ambulance sirens whizz by, people are running in the street, and the news reports show mass unrest and rioting across the country.<br/><br/>Before the train doors shut however, a sickly woman gets on board. She soon collapses and starts to convulse, only for a poor train attendant to tend to her and wound up bitten. It's a big train however, and Train to Busan starts to clearly establish the collection of characters on board. There's a tough husband and his pregnant wife, two elderly sisters, a young cheerleader, a rich and selfish corporate type, and an entire baseball team, who are handily packing many bats in their luggage. Panic soon sets in as the realisation of a zombie apocalypse dawns on the passengers, and with much of the country either in quarantine or overrun by the military trying to fight off the unstoppable hoard, its unclear just where and when they can stop. Seok-woo's intentions are to look out only himself and his daughter, and teaches the seemingly wiser Soon-an the same. But as the situation becomes increasingly dyer, it becomes clear that they are stronger together.<br/><br/>The atmosphere and tension are turned up to the max during some incredibly inventive set-pieces, which often make the most of the most mundane of locations. These are the running, screeching zombies of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, so cramped train carriages are quickly turned into narrow isles of death. As the passengers learn the zombies' weaknesses, such as their inability to work out a door handle or how they quickly forget about you once you're out of site, the darkness of long tunnels become their ally as they journey from A to B. Sang-ho Yeon is careful to keep the social commentary at the fore, highlighting how fear can turn the nicest of people into selfish, despicable monsters, and how important it is to fight out primal instincts in moments of terror. After a fast-paced first hour, the events become somewhat repetitive and the running time could do with some trimming, but it all pays off with a gripping climax. In a time of zombie overkill, Train to Busan still manages to feel fresh."
"UnderworldRocks","1","52","146","10 January 2017"," Not scary or gory. Tedious and boring. The ending sucks.
","Some of the characters' behaviours in the movie are laughable. For example, the first time the passengers got out of the train only to find the station infested with zombies. What was their reaction? Run back and open the door to a car already full of zombies! Smart move, people!<br/><br/>For another example, a bunch of survivors in car #15 refused to open the door for another group of survivors, because some guy feared the other group might be infected. Actually, one easy solution would be for survivors in car #15 to move to another car, for instance, car #16 and let those people have #15. Car #15 was not the only safe place. But... They were too dumb to make room, those idiots.<br/><br/>The beggar character's heroic move at the climax makes no sense. He had always been portrayed as cowardly. Therefore, the sudden 180 degrees change is not convincing at all.<br/><br/>Let's not forget the laughable ending. The little girl suddenly felt like singing after the disaster? Yeah, very interesting. It would have been so much better if the soldiers had killed both the pregnant woman and the girl. That kind of dark ending would have made an impact. The current one in the movie is ridiculous.<br/><br/>The plot was predictable. You could always guess who was going to die next. The movie is not even scary, and the amount of gore is atrociously little.<br/><br/>I guess the only good thing is the opening scene where a deer became a zombie deer. That was interesting enough."
"brycebclark","7","8","16","7 January 2017"," It wasn't flawless but still thoroughly enjoyable
","Overall, the plot and development of the story were engaging throughout. There were only a few forgivable occasions when the verisimilitude and consistency of dialogue, characters, and story were waning. To be completely fair, I really enjoyed the suspense kept throughout the entire film. The cinematography and editing captured the chaos of events really well and the deaths were neither predictable nor overdone. In the end, the protagonist reconciles his prior shortcomings and the film ends full circle. <br/><br/>My only grief is that I wish they would have saved more characters, allowing each group to find their own way out the train station after the separation (which would have been more realistic) instead of killing everyone immediately and leaving just the daughter and girlfriend as the focal point (which is the standard but so very typical.) I also wish the writers and director would have explored the night-blindness of the monsters in an open urban setting (imagine if you had discovered that these monsters were absolutely blinded in darkness; why would you not have shared this with everyone and made your escape plans to accommodate that huge advantage?) There was huge potential with that, so I am slightly disappointed it wasn't utilized more significantly. But, in total, I think the film managed a 7/10.<br/><br/>On a side note, I'm expecting some of these negative reviews are biased against the film for being of Korean origin. Also, the subtitles can suck."
"asda-man","9","11","24","21 September 2016"," Zombies on a train
","Zombie films have been hitting our screens since the dawn of time. Well, it certainly feels like they have anyway. Popularised by George A Romero's terrific Dead trilogy, zombie films have since been rearing their heads like hordes of the undead themselves. Whilst they can be a lot of fun, more often than not, they can also be clichÃ© ridden and trashy. We have had some quite enjoyable zombie films recently such as, Cockneys Vs Zombies and The Horde but we haven't really had a properly great zombie movie since 2004's Shaun of the Dead. Train to Busan changes that.<br/><br/>I saw Train to Busan on a whim. I'm travelling in Singapore and had a few free days so I thought that I'd check what's on the cinemas here. Train to Busan caught my eye but I had never heard of it, however I saw that it was Korean and that it had zombies in it, so I was sold! To my surprise, I came out of the cinema having just viewed easily the best zombie film in a decade. Korean films have hardly ever let me down and Busan is no exception.<br/><br/>As there's very little coverage of this film on the Internet, I'd better give a rough plot outline. It basically follows a selfish father who is cold and neglectful towards his cute young daughter. For her birthday, she wants to travel to Busan to see her mother so he reluctantly takes her on the train to Busan (creative title) however, a rather inconvenient zombie outbreak occurs as they board the train. The rest of the film is a claustrophobic and thrilling fight for survival as the survivors desperately try everything in their measure to get to Busan on a undead-infested train.<br/><br/>What makes this film so great is the characters. Most horror films (particularly ones with zombies in) sprinkle a load of disposable characters in who all die in a predictable order. We don't often particularly care when they die, in fact we're more likely to relish the gory death shown in all its bloody gory. In contrast, Train to Busan focuses in on a line of memorable characters who we actually care about and want to see survive. They're developed in such a way that when someone cruelly perishes, we feel a great sense of loss and emotion. This is where the film's strength lies. What's also interesting is that they're not all stereotypes either. The protagonist isn't your typical hero, he's a character who is grossly selfish and unlikable at the start, but he subtlety develops into someone you begin to care about and admire.<br/><br/>The film starts off as a good little zombie thriller. There's a sense of realism to the whole situation as we're made to watch the panic unfold on the train in an effective way. There's also a nice comic touch to the whole thing with some witty dialogue so it never takes itself too seriously. It also somehow never gets boring even though the film is essentially two hours set on a train, which is no easy task. There's always tension and a sense of peril. You get the feeling that anything could happen to these characters at any given moment. Once the film reaches the mid-way point though it stops being good and starts becoming great.<br/><br/>Things get going fairly quickly so the characters develop through the action, making the film all the more gripping as it goes on. It's an unpredictable ride with lots of thrilling set- pieces to keep you on edge. The final half hour is essentially non-stop action and it becomes exhausting to watch without ever feeling too ridiculous. What really impressed me though was the emotional charge in the second half. There are a few scenes which had me welling up with tears, which I wasn't expecting. I just got so absorbed in the characters and their intense situation. The use of music and editing is also hugely effective in pulling at your heartstrings.<br/><br/>There's really very little which Train to Busan does wrong. If I were to nitpick, I'd say that I would've liked more gore. Zombie films always give a good excuse to give us an array of fun, gory effects but this film is surprisingly restrained. There's a lot of hand-to-hand combat and nothing else creative. However, this does sort of add to the realism of the situation as you're not going to find many axes or chainsaws on a train. It's still not as bloodless as World War Z.<br/><br/>I can't urge you enough to watch Train to Busan, especially if you're a fan of Korean cinema. It doesn't just offer plenty of nail-biting thrills and impressive special effects, It offers emotion and splendid characters whom you can properly invest in. It's a powerful film which wears its heart on its sleeve and contains more character development in two hours than The Walking Dead has in six seasons. Once the film was over I became overcome with emotion. I felt like I could just break down and cry at what I had just watched. This is so much more than a zombie flick, at its heart it's a devastating drama about family and the importance of human kindness. I loved it."
"mrrcott","6","30","80","25 September 2016"," Starts well but runs out of steam
","You may think you know all about zombies but have you wondered what it would be like to be on a train with fifty of them all running after you and gnashing at your ankles?<br/><br/>Zombies on a train is the premise of this film, a big hit in South Korea. If you had no idea this film was a horror, or that it featured zombies, it might be quite exciting but I imagine most people will go into this knowing exactly what to expect.<br/><br/>Some kind of catastrophe has led to an outbreak in which dozens of writhing undead are roaming the streets of Seoul looking for their next victims. A group of travellers including main lead Gong Yu are on the train to Busan. They've barely gone twenty minutes before there is clearly something wrong with some of the passengers. Checking the situation on their phones, the passengers see that the country is in a state of emergency.<br/><br/>Cover.jpg<br/><br/>They try to leave at the next station but find that the soldiers who are waiting for them have already been bitten. The most exciting and tense scenes are when the group must flee back on to the zombie ridden train, running away from swarms of rabid recruits. Once back on its a long journey for the remainder of the film. Here's where the film runs out of steam. Once you've seen one zombie, you've seen them all. The film becomes a very standard struggle for survival and the scenes of characters running down train corridors become very repetitive.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film. Its directed in expedient fashion but for a train film its seriously lacking any ambient sound effects such as the clickety-clack sound you would expect of a train on a track (or do South Korean trains run completely silently?).Fans of zombies will not be disappointed.Otherwise, it's more of what we've already seen many times over.<br/><br/>My score: 6/10."
"wcoleparks","7","25","66","21 June 2016"," Great movie up to the last 30 minutes
","With such a high presence in both TV and film, zombies are becoming over used. Our fascination with them seems to quickly be coming to a close, so it takes something special to stand out. First time live action director, Sang-ho Yeon, has managed to craft a unique take on the undead by placing them on a train and adding a few things to their mythology. Despite underdeveloped characters and an overly sentimental final act, Train to Busan delivers a fresh take on the zombie movement that contains some extremely memorable set pieces. <br/><br/>The story revolves around a father who is taking his daughter to see his ex-wife. Yoo Gong plays the typical father who is more concerned with work than with family and does not always put people as his top priority. His daughter is the typical kid who knows how important other people are and always tries to do the right thing. This is where the film really falters. The characters fit perfectly into stereotypical roles and never feel like anything other than placeholders. There is the typical villain who never seems to die, the typical female characters who must rely on the men, and the group of people who blindly follow orders. There is one excretion however. During the train ride, the father and daughter encounter a couple with a child on the way. The man in this relationship is charismatic, charming, and above all, badass. When everything is about to go down, he is quick to suit up and prepare for a fight. This is the one character in the entire film that stands out and quickly becomes the reason you root for the characters to make it out. <br/><br/>There is also an incredibly emotional scene involving this character that really hits hard. The build up to the scene works well and because we are so attached to him, anytime he is at risk the stakes are raised. The scene is effective and almost brought tears to my eyes. This scene should have been the emotional climax of the film. Unfortunately the film goes on for about 30 more minutes and involves another emotional moment with the main character. This second scene however is not effective at all. Through flashbacks and an awkward script, the scene becomes cheesy and at a certain point comical. It didn't work and really took away from the previous emotional climax. <br/><br/>Typical of the zombie genre, the film does contain a social critique. Similar to Snowpiercer, the film uses its setting to comment on the class system and the social order we fall into. The businessman is ultimately the boss as he is superior in pedigree and it is up to everyone else to follow him or be cast aside. Additionally his character perfectly aligns with the dog eat dog world we live in today as he uses others for his own advantage. As he throws people to the wayside, literally to be devoured by those around them, it is clear the point that is being made. <br/><br/>Also borrowing from another film, the zombies here are fast. Just like in World War Z, they act like swarms of insects as they barrel through doorways and windows creating a sense of urgency slower zombies often fail to establish. They also look great. There are a few moments when they all swarm together, where it is clear CGI was used, but for the most part they used practical effects. The zombies move with disjointed, quick movements that make them very terrifying. It is almost painful to watch them contort their bodies as they converge on their victims. <br/><br/>The real unique characteristic though is that they cannot see well in the dark. This trait provides the basis for a number of intense set pieces as characters use sounds to mislead the zombies and navigate the claustrophobic setting from train car to train car. <br/><br/>Another great set piece involves the characters getting off the train. It appears as though they have reached a safe zone, but once they realize that they are mistaken, it becomes a race to get back on the train. Characters are killed, people are injured, and bonds are formed as people realize how much they need each other to survive. It is a nice diversion from what we have seen so far and gives the audience something different, yet equally intense, so the action doesn't get repetitive. <br/><br/>In the end however, the film does fail to keep us engaged. In the last 30 minutes, the film really starts to drag. The action is not as effective and then builds up to the disappointing emotional climax mentioned earlier. At this point, I just wanted our characters to reach safety, or die already. The very last scene however does work well. In a film filled with brutal action, it was nice to end on a heart-warming moment.<br/><br/>Train to Busan (2016) Directed by: Sang-ho Yeon Screenplay by: Sang-ho Yeon Starring: Yoo Gong, Dong-seok Ma, and Woo-sik Choi Run Time: 1 hour 58 minutes"

I was pleased to see there was a lot of attention to detail on each and every character. <br/><br/>The location is unique (98% of the film is shot on a moving train) and it really adds to the high stakes, fast paced, high stress environment.

","I love Korean horror movies. Right when the action and horror is at its peak they insert this home like humor that makes you feel for the characters and understand that while the plot might be ridiculous, so is real life.<br/><br/>This is not a comedy, like Gowemul, which I really liked, but has some of these moments that make it fun. The scene when the guy apologetically tells his pregnant wife ""Honey, can you run?"" while a horde of zombies approach was priceless.<br/><br/>So, yeah, it's a zombie movie. And while it feels fresh, it's nothing you haven't seen before. It's Korean, so it has some specific idiosyncrasies and some of the jokes or social issues it hints at might pass over your head, but it's not that deep.<br/><br/>I liked the actors, the kid was really good. The special effects were OK most of the time, but there was one ""explosion of zombies"" effect they used twice without it being needed and it looked kind of stupid. I liked the scene where the ""villain"" kind of explains how he feels and why he did the horrible and stupid things he did. It is important to care about your characters, including the bad guys and the sacrificial lambs. Americans might want to learn from that.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I had a lot of fun watching it.

"kevin_newdirections","8","12","28","8 September 2016"," The buzz for this film is totally worth it.
","Nothing turns me off more than when zombie films gradually derail from character development and fall into the trap of gorefests and amusement killing just for the sake of it. Train to Busan, however, restores my faith in the sub-genre as director Yeon Sang-ho does not treat his characters as mere cannon fodder. Each character arc is well-contemplated, the established relationships may not be equally potent with each other, but for a film to wrestle with so many of them while successfully maintaining the edge-of-the-seat tension, the result is quite brilliant.<br/><br/>We can see positive character growth in the main protagonist, Seok- wu (Gong Yoo), a divorced, workaholic fund manager/""corporate bloodsucker"" who consistently neglects his daughter Su-an (Kim Su-an). We get to know that he's not exactly father-of-the-year material, he buys his kid a Nintendo Wii for her birthday oblivious to the fact that he already one to her earlier the same year. He reprimands her daughter's misplaced kindness during the zombie invasion, ""In times like this, you have to think for yourself first."" Few scenes later, the girl says to him, ""You only think about yourself. That's why mommy left."" Boy, he just got ""re-educated"" This kid is going to be her dad's moral compass throughout their eventful ride to Busan.<br/><br/>Busan also includes a group of archetypal commuters to make this horrendous experience relatable to a wider audience: a pregnant woman (Jung Yu-mi) who's heavily relying on her brawny husband (Ma Dong-Seok), a pair of elderly sisters (Ye Soo-jung and Park Myung- sin), a pair of high-school sweethearts (Choi Woo-sik and Ahn So-hee) and a stern-looking businessman (Kim Eui-sung). The last person to hop in, however, is a girl with a strange bite on her thigh. We know where this heads now but the train crew seems to be more alarmed at the presence of a homeless man (Choi Gwi-hwa) hiding inside the washroom. Alas, once the infected girl rips the throat of her first victim and the zombies start to chomp and multiply (Hold the door! Hold the door! Hodor!!!), the film starts to categorize its characters: the selfless and the self- serving. These zombies may be the film's antagonist but there is a much more unsettling beast at the face of damnation: society quickly adepts to a new set of morals. Earning his spot as one of the most hated cowards in history, Eui-Sung's businessman character is the epitome of greed in this film. As he literally flings his fellow survivors to the undead for the sake of self-preservation, the point is clearly made that this is a dog-eat-dog world, whether it is the apocalypse or not.<br/><br/>Whereas its obvious competitor World War Z shows a city-wide scale of apocalypse, Busan proves that confining it to a smaller scale is not a hindrance to deliver well-choreographed and jolt- inducing action sequences. Needless to say, my favorite part of this film is when the three male characters start to navigate their way through the carriages, each station proving to be more difficult than the last one. It certainly helps to know that these morphine-driven, break- dancing zombies have a flaw to them: they can only see or hear but they can't smellÂ… and they're also not taught how to open doors. Once those rules are established, director Sang-Ho levels the playing field by turning tunnel drives into game cheats, washrooms into sanctuaries and luggage compartments into unlikely safe passages.<br/><br/>Train to Busan may not reinvent the zombie sub-genre per se but director Yeon Sang-Ho has a clever use of technique for this film to work both as a grisly form of entertainment and as a potent social allegory as well. For that, he solidifies his spot as a go-to- director when it comes to zombie films. The buzz for this film is totally worth it."

There are some really great scenes in this movie which I highly respect the director! This movie reaches all our emotion, all at the highest level like when it comes to the action scene, it makes me worry and follow all of them, my heart is beating fast like them; when it comes to the emotional scene, I cry and feel really sad..

","No genre has suffered from volume overload as the zombie genre. Zombie television shows, zombie movies both theatrical and straight to video, city zombie walksÂ….zombies are everywhere. Because of the glut of flesh eating walking dead, no genre has suffered so much with overkill. Zombies themselves are not particularly interesting beasts. They don't have any character. They just run (or slow walk) bite and run (or slow walk) again. You won't find many reviews on the thousands of zombie films that will go into detail about the complex layers of the zombie's inner mind.<br/><br/>With what seems like an endless parade of zombie films each week being offered across various platforms it's a nice surprise when a film such as Train to Busan offers what feels like a fresh take on an exhausted premise.<br/><br/>Train to Busan is a South Korean zombie film brought to us from writer/director Sang-ho Yeon. The idea is commonplace â€“ a zombie apocalypse is underway â€“ but the setting adds to the drama. The movie takes place almost exclusively on a train where the passengers are stuck in in a speeding bullet. And when an infected individual boards the train, the group's only safety will be in the various train cars free of the blood hungry hordes.<br/><br/>The group of characters that face life and death to zombie situations are an eclectic band of heroes and villains including a father and daughter team, a pregnant woman and her husband, a young teenage baseball team and various train attendants. Their survival is hanging on the notion that if the train full of zombies can reach the Busan station where the military is lying in wait.<br/><br/>Although there are plenty of been there/seen that moments in Train to Busan, the film still offers a fresh feel largely due to the claustrophobic setting. There are some fresh ideas â€“ such as what happens to the zombies when the train enters into a tunnel â€“ and these ideas coupled with zombies that run like Olympic qualifiers and above average special effects lead to a heart pounding rollicking good time.<br/><br/>One could not fully review Train to Busan without discussing the ending. Starting with an unexpected train crash the final few reels are filled with one surprise after another. And the ending is almost heart-wrenching in its execution.<br/><br/>Train to Busan is a thrill ride. A thrill ride that was a rousing crowd pleaser when it screened at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. But it is more than just a genre festival favorite. It is one of best zombie films every produced and might just be one of the best movies of any genre in 2016."

"Prashast_Singh","10","16","41","27 February 2017"," Train to Busan Review: An impressive action thriller with surprisingly amazing display of emotions!
","Movie: Train to Busan (A) (Why, CBFC India?)<br/><br/>Rating: 5/5<br/><br/>To be very honest, I had never watched a zombie film in my entire life. I had heard about such films and also realized that mostly Hollywood produces such films. TRAIN TO BUSAN is an exceptional addition not just to the list of the best zombie apocalypse action thriller, but also to the list of best films of world cinema which portray human emotions in the most realistic and heart-touching way possible. Yes, it's that excellent. <br/><br/>TRAIN TO BUSAN is the first South Korean film to have a wide theatrical release in India. That attracted too. It was released in India in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. I watched the film first in Korean with English subtitles, and then in Hindi. And I realized that the film manages to convey its message and make you reciprocate emotionally for the film, whether you watch the dubbed version or the original version. The Hindi dubbing was good enough to add to the positive feel.<br/><br/>The art South Korean filmmakers know is how to add an emotional feel to different genres. Thus, TRAIN TO BUSAN is no exception as it makes you feel for every character. Gong Yoo takes his performance to a higher level and raises the bar for world cinema actors in the climax. He is extremely likable and excellent. Ma Dong-seok is brave, lively and energetic too. Jung Yu-mi impresses big time with her beautiful & emotionally active character. Kim Su-an is cute & impresses with her strong act in sequences which one can't expect from a child artist of her age. Other actors too deliver performances great enough to make you care for them. <br/><br/>The film's scale is big, and the visual effects are amazing. Cinematography is excellent and captures the locales & thrilling action sequences with plenty of intrigue, while also succeeding in sending chills down your spine through the emotional sequences. Thankfully, it's not an Indian film, otherwise filmmakers won't have rested without adding songs & unnecessary romance. Whatever you see in the film, looks very, very realistic. The tension is very well built and neither do you deviate from enjoying the film, nor does the film deviate from storytelling. <br/><br/>The story and screenplay are both excellent, and the editing is excellent. The only thing that disappointed me was the A certificate given to it by the Indian Censor Board called CBFC. Why? No nation of the world gave this film an 18+ rating except India & Malaysia. Leave Malaysian Certification system because they follow equal rules for all films Irrespective of the target audience. But in India, films with dozens of gory violence & bucket loads of vulgarity get a UA (PG) certificate. TRAIN TO BUSAN is a clean family entertainer despite the A certificate it has been subjected to. But it's not a mistake of the makers, so there was no flaw I found in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, TRAIN TO BUSAN is a must watch film for any movie enthusiast. Irrespective of language and nation barriers, the film deserves to be watched by one and all. And yes, I forgot to tell. This film was the first one that actually made me cry. No film before had compelled me to shed tears, but this film did. Even the emotionless will emote. Such strong is this film. Go, watch it with your family and enjoy it fully, along with respecting the safe life we have from zombies in reality."

","Yoo Gong plays Seok Woo, a workaholic father who hasn't been enough of a presence in his daughter Soo-ans' (Soo-an Kim) life. Still, when she yearns for a trip to visit her mother, he agrees, determined to do right by her for a change. But the journey by train is like a sprint through Hell, as an undetermined virus is infecting SCORES of Korean people. It's up to a select few, including father and daughter, to survive and make it to Busan, which is supposedly something of a safe zone.<br/><br/>""Train to Busan"" is sometimes cartoonish and over the top, and does go on longer than is really necessary. The amount of time it takes for the virus to infect a bitten person varies depending on the needs of the screenplay. And writer / director Sang-ho Yeon isn't averse to succumbing to genre clichÃ©s, such as the one cowardly individual who will throw others to the wolves in order to buy himself more time. Fortunately, the director serves up a satisfying smorgasbord of carnage, and often gets by on pure showmanship. He also makes sure that the scenario retains its humanity, never letting the horror get completely out of control. His characters may sometimes be ridiculous, but he does give us some heroes for whom we can root. The performances range from reasonably sturdy to frenzied, and as a leading character Seok is a little unconventional, because he actually teaches his daughter to always look out for # 1 first, rather than be compassionate.<br/><br/>Pretty slick filmmaking and generous doses of gore help to keep this from ever getting boring, plus Dong-seok Ma (the expectant husband Sang Hwa) is a fairly amusing badass type of guy.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

","This was one of the best zombie films I've seen. It has several sub-plots, intense action, lots of suspense. At first you'd wonder how a movie with zombies on a train could span 2 hours, but this film did it outstandingly well! I could easily have watched it going on for another hour.<br/><br/>The scenarios are realistic (well as realistic at can be for there being zombies ðŸ™‚).<br/><br/>The film also presented a theme of man's inhumanity to man on one side, and the selflessness of man for his brother on the other side - all in the midst of a life and death struggle. This was set up very well early on.<br/><br/>It was interesting to observe the evolution of the main character as things progressed.<br/><br/>It may not be to everyone's taste, it's not as gore-filled as some other films (though there is carnage a-plenty).<br/><br/>Overall, I trilling film."

","""Train to Busan"" is an amazingly entertaining movie, with a few missteps that stop it from being truly great.<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple. Yoo Gong's Seok Woo is a man that only cares about his job. His wife has left him and lives in Busan, while his relationship with his daughter is becoming more and more strangled. The daughter (a quite amazing Soo-an Kim) wants to visit her mother for her birthday, and Seok Woo ends accepting. They decide to take the train from Seoul to Busan.<br/><br/>At the same time a zombie-outbreak happens in South Korea.<br/><br/>Cue lots of violence, running, blood and surprising moments, with a huge dose of feelings (but without falling into the cheesy).<br/><br/>The movie keeps things simple: train, zombies, stations, and a bunch of people that will try to survive (some of them will do anything to do so). In that respect it is not especially original. The plot is thin as it comes, but the direction keeps things fast and breezy, and plot developments keep happening non-stop. The direction is a little bit video-game style, but fits the movie. The originality in the fights between the zombies and the survivors is one of the strong points of the movie, with some surprising moments. On the other hand, it can't help but fall into the ""I-don't-want-to-live-without-you"" moments, or some extra saccharine situations. Also, some of the characters' decision-making is just silly, and even if a couple of moments are clearly comedy, the line between comedy and action-horror is not clearly drawn, and some laughs are more on the ""wrong-time"" side. Actually, the movie is not very scary, but it is quite the ride.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good, and some, as charisma-oozing Dong-seok Ma, or selfish-as-hell Eui-sung Kim, do a great job. And the music, scenery, and effects keep a good level thorough the film.<br/><br/>There is also a quite obvious social commentary, but it does it in a way that it hits target more than misses, and brings its ideas clearly across the screen. This commentary elevates the movie in its lowest moments.<br/><br/>""Train to Busan"" may not arrive on time, but you won't care."
"Turin_Horse","6","9","21","12 July 2019"," Some interesting elements... some cute girls... in the end just another zombie movie
","This is my third or so Zombie movie I have watched in my life, actually I generally despise horror commercial movies, but the hype about this one was so high that I decided to give it a try... Well, it is visually remarkable indeed, with some scenes quite well constructed (that train in flames entering the station!), it has gore, drama, suspense, drops of humor, and, maybe most of all... you can see three cute female characters lighting up the screen: Yu-mi Jung as a responsible young and attractive pregnant woman (it seemed to me she is a good actress), Su-an Kim as a cute and funny little girl who nags her father when appropriate and manages to gain your heart, and former K-Pop star Ahn So-hee as a sexy cheerleader whose legs and pretty childish face will keep you entertained and often distracted from the gory/action scenes.<br/><br/>However... is there really something interesting enough expected to come up from a Zombie film??. There is some social criticism underlying somewhere the plot... but it doesn't manage to fully emerge over the blood and head-shaking of the infected creatures... by the way, infected by what?, what was the origin of all the mess?... unanswered question. Then there are quite a few incoherent actions throughout the film, an example: in some moment one of the protagonists discovers that if the zombies are deprived from the vision of normal people by just attaching a paper to the window of the train inner doors they calm down and stop attacking... well, this simple trick is used just once and then totally forgotten for the rest of the film!, and there are some others like this.<br/><br/>All in all, just another zombie movie with some original elements. I guess many years will pass until I give another try to a commercial horror film... unless Ahn So-hee is in it, of course!"

","""I'll take you to mom no matter what."" Seok Woo (Yoo Gong)<br/><br/>This workaholic father, Seok Woo, doesn't realize the ramifications of ""no matter what."" South Korean zombie thriller and box-office phenomenon Train to Busan speeds him and daughter, Soo-an (Soo-an Kim), from Seoul like the titular conveyance through cars and society in a way reminiscent of Snowpiercer. The conceit works well because it can give ample thrills and jump scares while taking a figurative run through society from one car to another.<br/><br/>Train to Busan is much more than the sum of the frenetic zombie hordes that terrorize the train in scarily multiplying numbers. It is also about the community joining forces to combat crime, workers facing down management, commoners disdaining government in general, and distracted parents. Director/writer Sang-ho Yeon navigates between the terror and the commentary with effective timing, never letting the flaming story erase the sociological implications, which sometimes are heavy handed.<br/><br/>While cinematographer Lee Hyung-deok does first-rate work on the mise en scene (from macro shots of the train and stampeding zombies to action in narrow on-board bathrooms), and editor Yang Jin-mo keeps the story moving and understandable, Train is also about relationships. <br/><br/>Although several of the good characters do not make it to the station, those who do are representative of the hope humanity must have in its darkest times. Along the way we do have to experience the silly, cartoonish characterization of the cowardly bus-company executive Yong-Suk (Kim Eui-sung). He could have been a zombie.<br/><br/>I can't be sure how much of the South Korean audience embraced the implications of capitalism lying underneath the speeding-train motif. What I know is that for a critic who usually avoids zombie films unless they are humorous satires, I enjoyed Train to Busan as a multi-layered entertainment to appeal to just about anyone who likes to be thrilled by first-rate cinematography, a wild-ass story, and some heady thoughts along the way."
"paul_haakonsen","8","16","43","7 October 2016"," Snakes move over, because now there are zombies on a train...
","Oh yeah! South Korea is back on the zombie map once again with another overly impressive feature. This time it is ""Train to Busan"" (aka ""Busanhaeng""). And I dare say that with this 2016 movie then director Sang-ho Yeon really solidly places South Korea on the zombie world map definitively.<br/><br/>And although most of the entire movie takes place on a train from Seoul bound for Busan, then that is not really a hindrance to the enjoyment of the movie, because there is so much action and thrills to be had along the way that you forget that it only takes place on a train. But having the movie taking place on a train does also add some sense of claustrophobia and limiting the options of the protagonists.<br/><br/>The story told in ""Train to Busan"" is about Seok Woo (played by Yoo Gong) a fairly neglectful father whom is traveling to Busan with his daughter Soo-an (played by Soo-an Kim). A deadly outbreak of infection spreads on the train, turning people into ravenous zombies hungry for human flesh, trapping the people aboard the train with nowhere to run.<br/><br/>There is not really a dull moment throughout the course of this movie, and it does kick up into a high gear early on, and the movie keeps that pace all the way to the end. And that is really an accomplishment for director Sang-ho Yeon.<br/><br/>The acting in ""Train to Busan"" is quite good, and it is good to see Yoo Gong in a movie such as this. But I must admit that I was more than impressed with the talents of child actress Soo-an Kim. She was really amazingly talented, and I think that she will go on to have an impressive career in acting.<br/><br/>The effects in the movie were quite good, with just the right amount of gore and mayhem without it crossing into the gorefest territory. So this movie will appeal to a wide audience of fans of the zombie genre.<br/><br/>""Train to Busan"" had initially slipped under my radar and I wasn't aware of the movie, before someone actually asked me whether or not I was aware that this was a zombie movie. So with that information, I immediately sought out the movie, and there is no regret here at all, because I was more than genuinely entertained and more than impressed with the final result of the movie.<br/><br/>I can strongly recommend that you sit down to watch ""Train to Busan"" if you are a zombie aficionado like me. South Korea is making a lasting dent on the zombie world map, and if this is the level of future zombie movies from South Korea, then count me in for the long run.<br/><br/>""Train to Busan"" scores a solid eight out of ten stars rating from me; no doubt about it."

","This has to be one of the finest zombie and horror films in general I have ever seen. Extremely thrilling and captivating from start to finish. Everything in this film has done with passion and care. From the characters and heartbreaking moments they go through, visceral zombie attacks, acting and camera work down to dialogue. Everything works great. This is what World War Z should and could have been. Sure the plot of the film is not original, because yet again we are shown the struggle and survival of people during zombie pandemic, but the way the story is approached and executed is beyond most of the average mainstream horror movies we get these days. If you are a fan of zombie films you will definitely enjoy this horror gem."

","I'm not that into Zombie flicks, but I really liked this one. Aside from the zombie grappling action scenes which were pretty cliched, the truly compelling characters and the interactions between them is what makes this film a 10 for me.
The fractured relationship between the overworked 'arsehole' dad and his despondent daughter as he begrudgingly escorts her on the train to Busan so she could see her mother on her birthday, the two old ladies who have clearly been close friends for life, the true arsehole of the film who's only interest is his personal wellbeing, the possibly schizophrenic tramp, who people look upon as undesirable but grows in character and regard as the film progresses, and many others. But the star of this film is the little girl who is so expressive her story is written on her face and through the body language she has with her father and the people she meets on the train. 
 This film is pretty cheesy on the face of it, I mean what would you expect from a Korean zombie film. But It goes without saying such well developed characters in such a desperate situation lays bare in the most explicit way, human nature, the good and the bad. And some scenes will have even the most hardened hearts having to fight off a tear or two."

","'TRAIN TO BUSAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A South Korean zombie apocalypse horror flick, about passengers on a train to Busan that are trying to survive a zombie outbreak. It was directed by Yeon Sang-ho (who's only previous experience is in writing and directing animated horror and thriller movies), and it was written by Park Joo-suk. The film stars Gong Yoo, Kim Su-an, Jung Yu-mi, Kim Eui-sung and Ma Dong-seok. It's received almost unanimously positive reviews from critics, and it was a blockbuster at the international Box Office (breaking multiple records). I really enjoyed it as well.<br/><br/>Seok-woo (Yoo) is a divorced fund manager who's obsessed with his job and has made little time for his young daughter, Soo-ann (Su- an), in recent years. Seok-woo has promised to take Soo-ann to Busan, to see her mother, but of course things don't go as planned. A zombie outbreak spreads throughout the train, and seemingly everywhere in the area. Seok-woo, and his daughter, must work together with other passengers on the train, to survive the trip and hopefully make it somewhere safe. At the same time Seok-woo tries to prove to his daughter what a good father he can still really be (by becoming a badass zombie fighter).<br/><br/>The film has some great special effects, and awesome (brutal) zombie action scenes. It's a great dark horror movie, with biting social commentary on the battle of the rich verses the poor (despite how cheesy it might sound). It's also a surprisingly emotional character study, with a pretty diverse (and well developed) group of characters. The film is a lot of fun, it's satisfying to horror fans, and it's even got some decent drama in it (and acting).

","Wow.<br/><br/>Where do I even begin? This movie shows that Hollywood does not own the monopoly on quality film making. But checking out the quality of the entertainment of late coming from Hollywood, that's not really a stretch.<br/><br/>All young Su-an (played by Soo-an Kim) wants for her birthday is to spend it with her mother. So her separated and unengaged father Seok Woo (played by Yoo Gong) attempts to fulfill her wish. Her mother lives in Busan. That's a relatively unconventional short train ride, and with some coaxing, off they go.<br/><br/>But, of course, the train ride is anything but unconventional.<br/><br/>News filters into passengers on the train that something horrible is affecting people, turning them into crazed rabid flash eaters. Little do they know that this is about to infect the people on the train as well.<br/><br/>Along with Seok Woo and Su-an, there are a whole host of great secondary characters that round out the cast. Like cheerleader Ahn So-hee, reluctant boyfriend and amateur baseball player Young Gook (and the rest of the team), Sang Hwa, a linebacker or sumo wrestler or just a plain bad-ass, and his expectant wife Sung Gyeong. Do NOT mess with this man's wife and child! The train is a perfect setting for a zombie apocalypse showdown. The train can not stop at stations because they are all over-run by the hordes, and the living passengers are continually being squeezed into tighter and tighter quarters by the increasing number of swarming undead that move like World War Z zombies-on-meth.<br/><br/>Train to Busan is one of the best zombie action flicks I've seen in a long time. Director Sang-ho Yeon does an amazing job with pacing, the acting is top notch, and the screenplay (also written by Sang-ho Yeon) is visceral and touching.<br/><br/>Highly highly recommend!"

","(If you want to skip zombie pseudo-history, please go directly to the fourth paragraph for the film) <br/><br/>Train to Busan (2016) is the ""best Zombie movie ever"" like a few reviews mentioned, but I am not a particular zombie movie fan. In fact I may have seen a dozen and do not watch The Walking Dead (2010) but do highly recommend ""Men Against Fire"" episode of British Black Mirror (2011) sci-fi TV series as a perfect example of social, philosophical, psychological and political warfare examination with a mutant premise, akin to zombie in some aspects. <br/><br/>Korean anthology of short films Doomsday Book (2012) had ""A Brave New World"" segment that dealt with Seoul zombies in a thoughtful, sensitive way, while Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror (2007) film (segment of Grindhouse) was the best zombie movie before Train to Busan (2016). They surpass classics DAY OF THE DEAD (1985), 28 DAYS LATER (2002) and DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) but I haven't seen George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978) or his earlier NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968). Re-Animator (1985), Dead Alive (1992), Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Zombieland (2009) are supposed to be lots of fun. The Evil Dead (1981) and The Evil Dead II (1987) are excellently cheesy and gory and zombie-like enough to include here.<br/><br/>Yet, from all these United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) productions, perfection of the craft within the genre has not been reached. Western origins of Zombies (Haitian voodoo) and Vampires (Eastern Europe) and popularization in the US and Western Europe has not allowed a fresh look at the genre (fresh flesh?). Now Asian cinema is taking things to the next level with its innovation and history with effective horror. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) and Jee-woon Kim's Coming Out (2001) are some example of the best Vampire tales every shown and they are from Iran and Korea.<br/><br/>Train to Busan (2016) is a zombie film that is also a great action movie and a drama that holds its own weight. The characters are admittedly mostly one-dimensional but the dramatic action, moments, movements and details make it memorable and palpable. The main relationship is a failed father-daughter relationship that is fleshed out enough to be felt at many crucial moments of the film. Secondary characters are also important and contribute greatly to the narrative and emotions. The couple expecting a baby are the perfect counterpart to our main characters while other (regular or bizarre passengers, train personnel, baseball players) play adequate parts. The suspense is real even if you need some suspension of belief at many moments! <br/><br/>This is an action-packed ride and expertly paced. The dilemmas are non-stop and drama keeps unfolding until the final frame. Zombies are scary and cool, the cinematography and special effects play well into the narrative. The tension is well created and the twists and turns keep on coming even if a few or far-fetched or questionable, the majority of the story is strong and holds together. More than anything this is a fun, fast and relentless ride with people we get to care about in an impossible situation after the other. What movies are made for, more or less. In this case: more!<br/><br/>No reused Resident Evil (2002) profitable but predictably poor franchise here. I hope to also check out the animated work from the same director including a companion piece zombie movie set in Seoul..."

","I have to say that we generally avoid movies with sub-titles and Asian films. We want to watch the movie, not read the sub-titles and most Asian films do not make sense to me because of the cultural differences. Train to Busan had both these as strikes against it, yet for some reason, we decided to give it a shot, fully expecting to hate it and have another selection going in short time. Boy were we wrong!! About fifteen minutes into the movie, the main characters had been introduced, the stage set and the roller-coaster started heading down the first hill. And a roller-coaster ride it was. We were on the edge of our seats: anxious, happy, sad, shocked, the full gamut of emotions.<br/><br/>This is a zombie film, but it is an intelligent zombie film. The director does not resort to cheap gags and scenes that all of the zombie films now-a-days fall prey to. In many respects, it reminded me of World War Z and very well could have occurred in the same universe.<br/><br/>Sang-ho Yeon, who also wrote the screenplay, did an amazing job with direction. He gave the film depth and subtle levels.<br/><br/>Yoo Gong and Soo-an Kim, who play the father and daughter respectively, were so believable in their roles. The majority of the cast deserve praise for their work: you hate who you should hate, you like who you should like you change opinions about the ones you should change your minds about.

","I know. I know. If you are anything like me, you are sick to death of zombie movies. Many will rise to defend the sub-genre of horror. After all, there are only so many tropes and monsters that you can explore. In the same breath, one could say you are tired of vampire movies or ghost movies, but the fact is that I would say I am tired of all three. Maybe ""tired"" isn't the right word. I am skeptical. I have seen the originals that created the structures, the next wave of zombie films that re-defined what you could do with it, then every twist on the genre directors could come up with, from comedies like SHAUN OF THE DEAD to dramatic presentations like MAGGIE. Mostly, I am tired of every indie film maker with no better idea then to do a zombie flick devoid of imagination. So, it really takes a lot to impress me at this point, which makes it all the more surprising that TRAIN TO BUSAN is able to do just that.<br/><br/>There are two major things that make this movie work incredibly well, the action and the characters. The action elements of this movie is what will get it attention from the largest segment of audience. The fact that this is the first live-action film for the director is even more impressive. He cut his teeth in animation and it definitely shows. The movie has a kinetic sense of action and pacing that is straight out of an action cartoon. The movie feels almost like a comic book or cartoon come to life, in many ways. I could make many bad train puns here, but the movie feel like a ride on a steam train. It starts off slow and plodding, setting up the story, the characters and the angles and the movie slowly picks up more and more speed, until arriving at a fever pitch towards the end. That action is gripping and once it hooks you in, it doesn't let go. You will be on the edge of your seat as the movie takes you for a ride.<br/><br/>I said, earlier, that the action would hook the largest audience. Plenty of people just want an action-packed film and there is nothing wrong with that, but I know my friends in the horror intelligentsia will want a little something more on their plates, and this movie does not fail to deliver in character. The plot is pretty straight forward, zombies on a train, but what makes the movie really special is the characters. The plot revolves around a workaholic dad who agrees to take his young daughter to see his ex- wife. We see that the two have a very strained relationship, which naturally evolves through the course of the film. Along the way, we pick up additional characters. There is the drifter that portends the action and plays a pivotal part. The tough bruiser and his pregnant wife, who are important pieces in the relationships that will develop and prove to be much deeper than they appear in the surface. There is an a*hole businessman, who will sacrifice anyone to save himself. To a less defined degree, the baseball player and the girl who wants to be his girlfriend, who aren't as fleshed out as other characters, but provide a few interesting scenes.<br/><br/>Many zombie purists will not like the direction of the zombies themselves. At the risk of incurring the endless, tired debate of which are the best zombies, you could argue these aren't zombies, at all. They are ""infected"". They are much closer to rabid, chaotic horde of the DAWN remake, or more so, WORLD WAR Z, than the shambling undead of the original DAWN OF THE DEAD, or even THE WALKING DEAD. That last comparison is an interesting one. For all the people on social media complaining that the popular show is too slow, too boring, too talkative and there isn't enough focus on the zombies, this is almost the antidote. Full of action and full of zombies.<br/><br/>The movie has two big things going against it for a western audience, it's sub-titled and it's another zombie film. For that reason alone, many will avoid it. They would be doing themselves a big disservice as this movie is one of the best of last year and a great modern zombie flick."

","MY Dentist will love this film because I was grinding my teeth all through it. Fun flick that is well paced and acted. It is one of those films where you just watch and enjoy ""the ride."" Minimal character development, or rather economical development, but you end up liking all the main people, even caring about them. I don't know for sure but it seemed once the action really started it all happened in real time which added to the suspense. I do not like gory films and it would seem that this would be one, but it really was not. Sure lots of blood but no guts flowing freely or gore just for gore's sake. Action was in enclosed spaces but easy to follow. Best horror flick I have seem in many months."

","The horror genre has its fair share of hits and misses, however, it would seem that the sub genre of zombie horror suffers from the greatest ratio of misses to hits. Yes, the genre does have George A Romero's Night of the living dead and Dawn of the dead, as well as, spoof film Shaun of the Dead, but it would appear that is all we have. One must think hard to find a decent zombie film that doesn't end in ""of the dead""... Until now. Director, Sang-ho Yeon makes his live-action debut with what is in my opinion, the best zombie horror film ever. 2016's Train to Busan, or Busanhaeng as it's pronounced in its native country of South Korea, is more than just a simple zombie film, it's ultimately about evaluating what matters most in life, as well as being a social commentary of Korea's government and perhaps even our own.<br/><br/>Train to Busan's success as a horror film could be boiled down to a singular detail, character development. Countless horror films don't take the time to establish and expand upon their characters, resulting in little to no tension, people you more or less want to die and the audience's overall detachment from the film. The social messages of Train to Busan demand fully realised characters for them to have an impact, and fortunately, the filmmakers choose to flesh out a number of characters rather than a limited few. The film's main protagonist, Seok-woo, is a father who prioritises his work over his family, now having again disappointed his daughter, Soo-an, Seok-woo reluctantly agrees to take Soo-an to see her mother in Busan for her birthday, but of course, the zombie outbreak makes things a little bit more difficult The film is primarily the journey, pardon the pun, of Seok-woo as he's forced to be the protecting father he wasn't pre-outbreak and witness the consequences of his actions as a fat cat businessman. As well as this, the film features a married couple expecting their first child, however, the father has yet to name the baby. I for one, found the couple and their love for each other to be the most impactful and engaging. Train to Busan also features; a sports team where one member and a cheerleader have an off and on relationship, two elderly sisters who care deeply for one another and a selfish business owner who I believe represents the ruling class in Asia. Train to Busan is rich with subtext, making it more of a mental and emotional journey than a physical one.<br/><br/>In addition to the emotional message of human life matters most, Train to Busan is contextually relevant in the modern day. With North and South Korea technically still at war having never signed a peace treaty, but more importantly, North Korea's constant threat of nuclear attacks and Donald Trump Well Doing what he does best as president, adding fuel to the fire and being racist So it's safe to say things are pretty sh*t in Korea at the moment. Train to Busan takes aim at the ruling class, from the fat cat businessmen like our protagonist to the government itself, controlling the media and thus the people to fit with their political agenda. The continent of Asia is no stranger to censorship and unquestioned authority figures such as dictators, and so I believe Sang-ho Yeon is attempting to highlight the errors of totalitarianism by effectively bringing a ruling class man to the ground, to see the errors of his ways and the ways of those like him. The shoe is on the other foot and together with the breathtaking performances from the films cast along with the films character development, this message is made all the more powerful.<br/><br/>It isn't all serious however, there is a lot of fun to be had and the film is incredibly entertaining. The action set pieces throughout Train to Busan are large in scale, visually stunning and seriously impressive. Visceral imagery takes the place of cheap jump scares in this competently directed action horror film. Yeon wants to scare you with the culturally relevant subtext, in conjunction with horrifying imagery, instead of simply relying on a loud noise. Director Sang-ho Yeon also understands the horror genre, its themes and concept. It's all about fear, but not just of a killer, a ghost, a vampire or zombie etc. Horror can be the fear of anything and Yeon has made a film that is more about the fear of failing as a parent, disappointing your family and fearing for your country, than it is about the fear of zombies. The human fear amongst the supernatural is what truly makes Train to Busan the best of its genre.<br/><br/>The world is a scary place. The divides between the rich and the poor remain intact and the threat of war is ever-present. Yet humanity does exist, there is light in the darkness we just have to open our eyes to the horror of others. Train to Busan is a poignant, relevant and phenomenal film which takes the audience on the same emotional journey as its characters. It's an extremely tense film thanks in no small part to the phenomenal cast and use of character development. This film can be read on a number of levels, I just hope people see it for what it truly is, a social and political statement highlighting the lack of humanity seen in the modern day."

"coreyjdenford","8","7","16","28 October 2016"," Train of horror
","This is my review of Train to Busan (spoiler free)<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>AFTER SEVERAL YEARS of the boring, brooding and sort of manipulative over pretentious plotting on The Walking Dead over the last couple of seasons adding some lazy new characters and even lazier walkers, in addition to that the lazy, inept copycats with a lot of action but not enough story or character depth the zombie sub-genre has felt a little bit tired and somewhat overused at points; it needed a breath of fresh air to come back to life thankfully one man writer/director live-action debutant Yeon Sang-ho's Train to Busan brings the fresh air that the sub-genre sorely needed and does it in style. The story is simple and very straightforward as the film opens with Seok woo (Gong Yoo) a man with a workaholic lifestyle as a hedge fund manager and is always absent from his precocious young daughter Soo-an (Kim Soo-an), the two then take a train from their home in Seoul to Busan, at the bottom end of the country but as a suspicious passenger boards the train and what started out as a general commute turns into a train of horrors, as most of the passengers turn into a mass horde of ravenous flesh-eating crazies and the survivors have to survive the vicious attack and outrun the infected to survive.<br/><br/>It may sound like a general zombie film with a very familiar premise but the good story and clever plot adds a lot of tension, a masquerade of zombies and high-octane action that refuses to take a break but when it does the film adds in a lot of drama and character depth to points where it's needed. For its length at a total of 118 minutes it is a bit longer than most traditional films of this genre but the pacing of the story is astonishing as for the first 45 minutes it teases the audience with a lot of memorable zombies, action and some terrific heartfelt and harrowing drama that's unpretentious fun. Instead of meeting traditional standards of other zombie subgenres and killing off some new characters as soon as they are introduced as shown in Cell earlier this year this goes with introducing new and important character that are instantly lovable. Two of these characters we meet very early on, a man Song Hwa (Ma Dong-seok) who doesn't take to Seok as soon as he meets him because he thinks that he is just a rich business man who doesn't care for anybody but himself, and his young pregnant wife Sung Gyeong (Jeong Yu-mi), who falls in love with Seok's daughter straightaway. These two characters are instantly lovable and add a lot of drama to the story where it's needed. <br/><br/>Though for some parts Song has to put up with Seok and even has to fight through some of the horde in a scene when they are both heading towards a car to find Seok's daughter they have to fight through some of the zombies, however they find out that they can't see in the dark – it's a very enjoyable concept to story that is both action packed and inventive genius as there has other no other film with that kind of intuitive genius. At one point in the second act the train has a stop at Daejeon station and it all seems fine to that passengers and looks like it hasn't been infected but the passengers get attacked by the fast infected, but how fast are they? Imagine Usain Bolt on steroids; that fast. However the survivors don't have guns to defend themselves from the infected which is another enjoyable additional genius to the story as there are far too many zombie sub-genre films that rely on guns for defense, this should be a lesson for Hollywood to take in that guns aren't always a good thing. Although the film isn't flawless not by a long way as the infected are strung together by heavy amounts of CG rubber no, it's not a sequel to World War Z, there is also an elderly man who tries to block Seok and some other survivors out of the rest of the train tries saying that they are infected he's more loud than good and there are zombies that don't die from falling out of a window.<br/><br/>The third act is the most dramatic as it offers some heavily impacting heartfelt drama that is guaranteed to make even the most cynical person roll in flood of tears as the train reaches its final descent towards its destination there are some heartbreaking deaths with some of the more lovable characters that leads to an ending which could see a sequel being made that has already been announced. Aside from familiar premise with World War Z and 28 Days Later and the length of the story this is a brilliant, ingenious, and terrifying zombie film that adds a lot of tension with lovable in-depth characters giving brilliant performances, director Yeon Sang-ho's no nonsense story never ceases to deliver and it proves to be just as biting as Bong Joon-ho's dystopian sc-fi thriller Snowpiercer this original story is a breath of fresh air that is better than other Hollywood films of this sub-genre, so we can all breathe again. In short, the zombie sub-genre is back to its best and in terrific style as this could easily one of the best zombie films ever.<br/><br/>VERDICT: A purely terrifying, original and no nonsense roller-coaster ride filled with fast paced high-octane action, memorable zombies and harrowing emotion that refuses to stop as it delivers a lot of bite; easily one of the best ever zombie films.<br/><br/>8/10 Brilliant."

","One of my favorite zombie movie, though parts of it was very predictable. I went into it blind with very little expectation but enjoyed the rollercoaster I was strapped on to.
The characters were okay. I know they were trying to invest a lot of dialogue to keep you emotionally attached to each death but I wasn't feeling it. The hobo guy should've died a long time ago but they kept him around so that there would be someone to save the pregnant women and the kid. The dads death at the end felt forced and was completely unnecessary. He only died for dramatic effect purposes.
I did like one character though, the train conductor. He was always cool, calm, and collective. He tried to save as many people as he could but that ultimately lead to his demise.
It's a good movie but not something I would watch again any time soon.

"johnsonzac","9","3","5","14 March 2019"," Train to Busan: Action, Horror, and Sadness.
","Train to Busan is a movie that you probably haven't heard about. I didn't either until my dad forced me to watch it with him. He didn't tell me much about it, except that it was a zombie movie. We've seen zombie movies, the cliche walking corpses and the race to survive. I figured it would be just like them, and wasn't prepared for much. Boy, was I wrong. If you can get past the subtitles, you should brace yourself for an emotional, action-packed and morally challenging adventure, as there is nothing like this movie and I doubt there will be for a long time. Unlike well-known zombie-horror films/shows like The Walking Dead or World War Z, Train to Busan manages to create an emotional attachment to the characters. Even though the main character starts out as a prick, we still feel for him and want to see him improve. It kind of reminds of me of the movie Shaun of the Dead, in the sense of a unique approach to the cliche. Shaun of the Dead takes a more comedic and wacky approach to the cliche, with some hints of seriousness, and Train to Busan takes a serious and somewhat realistic approach, with some comedic moments, which is a good balance. The movie somehow packs in these emotional attacks with exciting unique action into a two-hour film, making it hands down the best zombie survival movie along with providing a unique and enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>The film starts with the main character Gong Yoo (It's Korean) sitting in an office space and is depicted as a supervisor or administrator of a large corporation. He returns home for his daughter's birthday, late, and gives her a Wii U, which she already got from her mom. He also missed her singing performance, causing her to lose confidence and stutter out of singing. Right off the bat, we know that he's not the best father, but he still cares for her. Things get serious when they board a train to the city Busan to see her mother, as a strange and hysterical woman sneaks on board. Of course, that woman is what you would call a zombie, and thus the classic virus spreading action begins. While their whole city is worrying about their own zombie attack, we get to see it from the point of view of train passengers who are cramped in a small linear passage trying to survive.<br/><br/>If you were to just look up the movie and take a glance at it, it would look silly. It's hard to make a zombie movie not look ridiculous. Now before you say ""Well it's a zombie movie, isn't that silly?"" While that is true, the movie somehow takes a silly and cliche concept and magically turns it into something serious, exciting, and original. Of course, there are some inescapable unrealistic moments; such as train security not noticing a clearly strange woman without a ticket board the train, or nobody regarding the woman while on the train. Those are just nit-picky things you can't avoid.<br/><br/>Every movie has its faults, yet the faults in Train to Busan don't even come near to how amazing the film is. As I've said before, the pure emotional value packed in with exciting action makes it so great. I don't know exactly how they did it, but I can tell you that the two ""Us vs Them"" and ""Me vs Us"" themes play a big role. Us vs them is pretty obvious; a group of strangers banded together to fight the evil zombies outside, sharing resources and information. However, the Me vs Us theme goes a bit deeper. Would you sacrifice everything for a bunch of strangers you just met on a train? Or would you abandon them in hopes to survive on your own? We witness the characters go through these decisions and change as the story progresses. Gong Yoo was a businessman who wouldn't raise a thumb to help the poor, yet later on, he risks his life for a homeless man by turning back to help him up to run from a horde of zombies. After watching the movie I felt the effects of its message.<br/><br/>Along with moral challenges, by the end of the movie, you will shed a tear. Trust me. You will feel sorrow for the characters. This is one of the few movies where I actually felt sad after watching it, and that's saying something for being a zombie movie. I definitely wasn't prepared for it, and it hit me like, well, a train. A lot of movies you will forget about after a couple of weeks, and some you will hold on to for a very long time. This is one of those that you will hold on to."

","Train To Busan ended the contempt of the Zombie in Hollywood. considering the difficulties that this movie saw to be made, It is very well made with the limited production. The story focused on the father and daughter relation that we moved with through the story. The movie however couldn't make the story more solid where there are some scenes that played very important turns in the plot that was based on coincidence and Exaggerated action by the heroes that made the situation worse and worse but I have to say it most of the movie was very entertaining and made my on the edge of my seat and a lot more was sensible. The bad character I found it overrated and over performed. Gong Yoo Soo-an as The father and as the daughter did a great job in their roles and their relation was the warm part of the movie. I take my hat off to all who worked to bring out this picture and the director Yeon Sang-ho ."
"hristihomeboy","8","3","5","12 June 2018"," So I've never been the biggest fan of zombie films so I decided to give them another chance and look up some of the ""best"" of them online.
","Seok-woo (played by Gong Yoo) is a divorced fund manager who tries to have a relationship with his estranged daughter. Due to his workaholic nature he rarely sees and talks to his daughter so when she asks him to go to Busan to visit her mother for her birthday he reluctantly accepts. They board the train and depart. However right before the train sets off a strange looking woman enters it seemingly running away from something and with a bite wound on her leg. We soon see that she has been infected with something and she starts attacking the train attendant. After that chaos ensues and we see the people that have not been infected try to move to the front of the bus to evade the zombies. We are introduced to Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, a high school baseball team, the person we will all love to hate Yon-suk, two elderly sisters In-gil and Jon-gil nd and homeless man.<br/><br/>My favorite character was definitely Sang-hwa. I absolutely loved him as a character and he was the type of character that you would love as a person and not just a fictional character. The main character was not as interesting for me but it was really enjoyable watching him turn into a totally different character and grow throughout the movie. The acting overall was great and the actors really made for feel worried for them especially the little girl.<br/><br/>As someone who usually dislikes zombie films this movie really surprised me in the best way possible. The story and cinematography were amazing, the pacing was done perfectly and the setting was the ideal place for this kind of movie. It really brought out the feeling of claustrophobia and hopelessness as the people were just one door away from a horde of zombies. The drama in the movie was also very good and watching the people deal with the situation as well as deal with themselves was very entertaining.<br/><br/>If I had to point out the things I disliked about the film it would probably be the cliches. There were a few cliche characters that you would expect in a movie like this which were annoying at parts. There were also a few plot points which I disliked that seemed to be only there to make you feel a certain way about certain events and characters.<br/><br/>Still the movie was far, far more enjoyable than I expected and I am very glad that I decided to watch it. Check it out for yourselves and let me know if you enjoyed it as much as I did."

On the whole after watching it I felt this was set at the same time as World War Z, just from a South Korean point of view. 
The action was well placed and kept you going confined on the tight space of a train it felt claustrophobic and again reminded me of the zombie outbreak on the plane in WWZ.

","This begins with one of the best pre-credit scenes I've seen in a while, featuring a deer knocked down and apparently killed by a flustered van driver. Moments later, the crumpled body in the road judders back into life, struggling to stand. As it does so, we see its eyes – dead and milky. The creature has joined the ranks of the living dead! Next we meet sulking child Soo-an (Kim Su-an), who is upset because her father Seok-woo (Gong Yoo) works all the time and spends no time with her. I have a problem with this kind of thing, and other similar scenes in other films. Perhaps the child would be less brattish if the parents gave up work and instead of a WII (or two) to play with, she had a stick and a clementine. Hardly! ""Dads get all the bad rap and no praise,"" says big soft husband Sang-hwa (Dong-seok Ma) at one stage. Seok-woo, however, has his own story to tell  Anyway, this distant father and child are but two passengers who board the train to Busan, amid news reports of violence and rioting in the streets, and also a wayward passenger exhibiting symptoms of a strange and deadly disease.<br/><br/>And we're off. Whilst the rapid transformations of many passengers into zombies relies perhaps too heavily on the actors' facial mannerisms and comes across often as 'over-enthusiastic' acting, there's no denying the effect of an enclosed body of people reverting into killers in some tensely choreographed scenes.<br/><br/>My favourite character might well be Michael Ripper-like Yon-suck (Kim Eui-sung), self-serving CEO who does everything, and betrays everyone, in order to survive amidst the spitting, fast-moving zombie creatures. In one of my favourite scenes, the ringtone of a mobile phone in another carriage is used to successfully deflect the attentions of the ravenous pack. Watching them charging as one toward the source of the sudden, tinny music, is very effective.<br/><br/>Every possible drop of tension is wrung out into the running time. For a while whilst watching 'Last Train to Busan', I felt there was something holding it back from greatness. Brilliant direction, acting and urgent pacing – however, I couldn't get completely immersed in it. And then, somewhere along the way, that changed and I was hooked. The tension is impossible to resist. What a journey!"

","Train to Busan is an uber-entertaining action-packed, not-a-minute-of-rest Zombie Korean movie. No time to get bored, the zombies are like rats coming out of nowhere, with a healthy appetite for human flesh, and our heroes are bunch of normal good people stuck on the carriages of a train heading to the city of Busan.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which has nothing to envy to any of Hollywood zombie movies. The film might pass as an American film except for the message, because the message is definitely not Anglo-Saxon culture is Asian culture - individualism sucks, you care and you take care of your people, your don't just look after yourself, that is egotistical and inhumane. You are an hero for the love of your people not a hero per se. On the other hand, as always happens on this sort of movies, one questions who is more savage, the zombies, who became so against their will, or the humans not infected treating other human beings inhumanly out of suspicion.<br/><br/>The actors are good in their roles but the beautiful girl Soo-An Kim is really the best of the lot. Her face is uber-beautiful, but without her mix of innocence and her dramatic qualities as an actress the film would have not worked or been so impacting. One really believes that what is happening to her is real. I also loved Yumi-Jung as the pregnant fragile Seong-kyeong, and Eui-sung Kim is excellent as the quintessential baddie Yon-suk.<br/><br/>The main downside of the film is not what is in the film, but what is not in it.

","""We are sorry to announce, that the 9:53 service to Waterloo has been cancelled due to a zombie outbreak"" fortunately, for us in the UK, the chances for widespread outbreak via train networks is somewhat diminished due to strike action, bad weather and foliage on the tracks. (Joking aside, I actually like and praise our public transport and yes, I have and do, use it a lot) <br/><br/>We've had bombs on the bus, terrorists on a ship, snakes on a plane and now, zombies on a train. Korean animation director, Sang-ho Yeon gives us his live action feature debut which happens to be a sequel his animated feature, Seoul Station that came out earlier this year. <br/><br/>There's no doubt, Sang-ho knows this genre well and all the elements of great zombie movies are predominantly there, especially the anxiety you feel for the characters being ferociously chased, willing them to ""hurry the f$% up"" and moments of sudden disappointment when people are bitten or lost. It's like The Walking Dead cramped into one carriage. <br/><br/>It's an obvious storyline, that's doesn't really derail however, fortunately, that doesn't mean it's a total predictable fare, because it isn't. There's some clever elements that set a brilliant premise for key scenes and fights for survival. But in a nutshell, zombie outbreak, that leaks onto a fast moving train. <br/><br/>The characters are brilliant and are a mixture of flawed unlikely heroes that perform outrageous heroics in order to survive and protect their loved ones. Central to father and daughter, They meet a multitude of other commuters that's reminiscent of classic disaster movies like the Poseidon Adventure or Tremors. <br/><br/>Yoo Gong plays the neglectful father who reluctantly escorts his daughter to Busan; the daughter played by Soo-an Kim, who is simply amazing being the kind-hearted, curious and fearful child. Dong-seok Ma has to be my favourite and you'll see why, as he punches his way through the hordes of undead; the platform rush in particular was epic. There's one character who is so awful, I have not hated any other character quite so much since the dickless Walter Peck from Ghostbusters. But there's the typical business man, pregnant lady, granny, baseball- bat tottling teenagers and a hobo among the passengers. <br/><br/>There's actually quite a lot of emotional content, with some selfish stupidity and righteous retribution. The chemistry between the characters is conveyed greatly with dilemmas, difference of opinion and fear either dividing them apart or bringing them together. <br/><br/>The zombies themselves come as standard issue, usual makeup, script and costume, and as zombies come, they look and act the part superbly, but what makes these a slightly different breed from your usual face-munchers is their unnatural movement, which can only really be described as body-popping, like the casted a bunch of street dancers to play the zombies adding a more quirky and grotesque style of zombie. <br/><br/>It's pure brilliance and class, and certainly one of the best zombie movies I've seen. Incredibly action-packed for the 118min runtime and doesn't let up from the moment you first encounter the infected. A must for all zombie fans. <br/><br/>""Tickets please"" <br/><br/>Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 9 Script: 8 Creativity: 10 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being an epic zombie movie!

It then dissolves into a wonderful outbreak occurring, very well done. But then it begins to try make you care about characters that are just bad at acting... the main actor is dreadful. You literally won't feel any care at all for him, or the little girl that non stop complains. As you'd expect a film like this needs the also have a pregnant women so you feel some tension, and while this is quite stereotypical, she was one of the better actors in the film. <br/><br/>The story is just abysmal, and the main character doesn't help at all. A stereotypical business man must get his kid to safety. But get ready for multiple references to how horrible he is. The whole plot has a nice general idea ruined by stupid situations where you'll find yourself saying ""really?"" A lot. SPOILERS: Also, if you've watched it... how did they expect to ""verify"" anything walking through the tunnel when it's ""too dark""??? Looks like they'll be shooting everyone on sight. <br/><br/>TLDR: Poor acting, forced situations, and SO many stereotypical characters will make you go ""really?"" One too many times."

","Its a Korean Film, so you expect Korean weirdness meets Zombies. No such thing. Same make up, no dialogue, people crying all the time, even the deaths to further the plot don't really do that. It doesn't even make an effort to have characters that appeal to the audience. No clear Protagonist or Antagonist, no real attempt at keeping a flow, the story line seems to be written for a TV show (walking dead wink wink) and got picked up for a movie.

","Pure waste of time. Traditional cliché. Korean version of Hollywood movie ideas. It became boring 20 years ago. If in the ending, those soldiers would kill both of those survivors, then it would be more inspiring, and worth at least 6 out of 10. In a real zombie event, numerous innocent people would die. the correct decision should be selfish in order to survive in extreme events, such as war. The movie is trying to sell the idea of being selfless during war, which is completely unpractical. Traditional cliché, main actors always survive. (Strongly suggest ""Expect the unexpected"", where everyone die at the end.) There is no innovation in this movie, the story line is copied from ""World war Z"". This movie might do well in a domestic level, but it is far less qualified even to premiere in an international level. I would have given it 1 out of 10. But the ending tunnel part has some innovation, so final score is 4 out of 10. Bad cutting from director, if I were the director, I would have end the movie at the tunnel. At least it would end with possibilities, where I would mark the film 6 out of 10. Draw a Snake and Add Feet to It"

","Zombie movies aren't quite dead yet. Over the past several years zombies have snuck their way into pop culture, overtaking almost every form of entertainment and putting themselves in the for front as the most beloved ""monster"". There's zombie survival guides, magazines, TV shows, and, of course, movies. 'Train to Busan' is one of those movies. But, as of late, zombies are seeming to wane in popularity. It would seem that the zombie's novelty has started to wear down due to its incredible over-saturation. That being said, when they are done right they remain a rather fun gimmick. Unfortunately, this film is really nothing more than that.<br/><br/>It's a fun gimmicky movie that doesn't do too much else. But while it lasts, it's a blast. The film almost immediately gets started showing the slow beginnings of the outbreak. A couple burning buildings, some emergency vehicles darting around, and the occasional convulsing person. This type of first act isn't new or different by any means but it's the fact that we get into the action within ten minutes that makes this movie instantly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Despite the dumb family dynamic that the film introduces the opening forty-ish minutes is probably the most visceral action in a movie so far this year. This is largely thanks to the actual filmmaking. The camera-work is all extremely fluid and interesting. There is rarely a moment when I saw a shot and thought it looked bad. The director uses the camera to help build tension instead of just throwing in loud sounds and music.<br/><br/>It also helps when the makeup effects and performances are as well done as they are. Obviously, there is a fair amount of blood in this here movie and it's used sparring enough to help heighten a scene, instead just being the scene. And the actors that get the nice close ups as the zombies all do a wonderful job selling it. There are multiple wonderful moments when the zombies fling themselves down thrashing wildly.<br/><br/>The best moment is definitely when an army man throws himself off the train and breaks his arm. It just dangles behind his head as he gets up and takes off running. It's these wonderful little touches that make this film enjoyable over a 'World War Z' type of movie. But not everything works in this movie. The script is particularly messy. This feels far closer to a big budget Hollywood movie, except without the budget.<br/><br/>The most noticeable bad aspect of the film is the visual effects. Even though the majority of the film takes place on the actual train, there are plenty of times when we move off of said train and the run down world comes into focus. What we get are mostly unconvincing effects that hinder more than help. Fortunately, they are used sparring enough to not be a huge issue.<br/><br/>But, like I said earlier, this film's script is specifically poor. This mainly stems from the emotional manipulation that it has. It tries to offer characters that you like but it doesn't develop on them. They are people that have families and the film expects you to just like them for no reason. And since you are supposed to like them for no reason it tries hard to have tear jerking moments.<br/><br/>Every time it does, they are horribly predictable and nothing more than manipulative. It pauses the film to have the sappy music and the zoom ins as the characters pretend have emotional moments. Every time this happened, and it does far to often, I just wanted to punch the movie in face and yell, ""GET ON WITH IT!"" If you want to have these moments in your movie, that's fine, but you need to have well- written characters. Or just go non-stop balls to the wall action.<br/><br/>And that's where this movie fails. It tries desperately hard to be both action packed and emotional. When you try this hard to strike a balance, one aspect or another will suffer at any given time. Every time the film slows down to have characters talk, I just wanted to die. It affects the pacing in the worst way possible by making this a boring yet fun movie. It's definitely enjoyable to watch and it has a lot of great elements. If you like zombie movies or action oriented movies, you'll probably like this one, but for anyone else watch 'Dawn of the Dead' again."

The only interesting part is definition of zombies as blind creatures in the dark. Kudos for that.

","If you're looking for a solid PG-13 foreign zombie flick, Train to Busan is a great choice. It drags a bit at the beginning, but the undead are quick and horrifying, and the story keeps your adrenaline pumping once it gets going. It's not overly gory, either. This movie relies on the hopelessness of the situation to frighten you. I'd happily add this to my collection of zombie movies."
"kosmasp","8","4","8","17 April 2017"," Even Korea isn't safe
","From zombies that is. Obviously if you're not into horror and/or zombies you probably shouldn't watch this. While it does also work as a drama (some of the best horror movies do), there is a lot of blood and a lot of violence. Just putting that out there (or should it be in there?). They also made an Anime as prequel to this. And while that is good in its own right (if you don't have an aversion against animated movies), you don't have to watch it beforehand.<br/><br/>The acting is more than decent for a movie like this, but it is really a fast paced movie, so once it starts running, there is no real slowing down. Which is also true of the zombies. So if you're a ""purist"", you may take issue with that. I personally like the slow zombies myself too. It becomes more of an action movie, when they run. Having said that, when it's done as good as it is here, I don't mind either.<br/><br/>South Korea is good when it comes to action, so that was kind of to be expected. If you had the opportunity to watch this on the big screen, good for you. But with home cinemas evolved there is enough to take and enjoy at home too. Best watch it with friends though, to get a vibe going"
"dcarsonhagy","7","4","8","27 December 2016"," A Zombie Film with Heart
","""Train to Busan"" weaves a tale--and very good one--about how much life is worth living and how we ALL take it for granted. The story starts with a father and his daughter boarding a train in Seoul destined for Busan. Little do they know their innocent trip will eventually end in a fight for their lives and everyone around them.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed most about ""Train"" was the characters were REAL. Each person played his/her part with panache; therefore, it was easy to feel for each of them. From the homeless man who boards the train with a foreshadowing message to the self-centered father, every part is just as critical as the others. To me, it would be hell on earth if this kind of outbreak happened: nowhere to run; nowhere to hide.<br/><br/>""Train"" is rated ""R"" for violence, language, and disturbing images. It takes the zombie genre to a completely different level with its superb acting and photography. In Korean with subtitles, this one is recommended."
"CinemaClown","Null","6","14","24 January 2017"," World War Z Meets Snowpiercer In A Non-Stop Thrill Ride
","A non-stop locomotive ride that lets the fast-moving & instantly-infected zombies from Brad Pitt- starring World War Z go haywire inside a fast-moving train, this South Korean zombie apocalypse horror is a highly gripping, thoroughly entertaining & consistently engaging journey that moves at breakneck speed from start to finish and keeps ratcheting up the tension throughout its runtime.<br/><br/>The story of Train to Busan finds an absentee father & his young daughter boarding a train from Seoul to Busan to meet her mother. But all hell breaks loose when the train is overrun by zombies and results in death & reanimation of numerous staff members & passengers. With nowhere to run, the two team up with other surviving members to ward off the infected until the train makes it to its destination.<br/><br/>Directed by Yeon Sang-ho, the film borrows certain elements from Marc Forster's World War Z & Bong Joon-ho's Snowpiercer but carves an original storyline that's brilliantly executed on the film canvas. Sang-ho's kinetic direction keeps escalating the stakes with skilfully crafted moments of horror and slowly but steadily manages to compel the viewers to invest in the characters' journey & eventual fate.<br/><br/>The zombies retain their vicious nature but an added weakness does allow for some suspenseful moments that are expertly carried out. While the movie makes use of CGI in the depiction of the reanimated corpses, the zombies look far more believable than the artificial mess they were in the film they are lifted from, not to mention that even the human characters exhibit an emotional core that was missing in that feature.<br/><br/>The dramatic portions, however, are a tad too overblown as the director is unable to pull them off with same zeal with which he carries out the action-horror segments. The technical aspects are finely executed and the film as a whole really benefits from its energetic camera-work, tight editing, excellent choreography, first-rate production design & fitting score and although a few CGI shots don't look realistic enough, it serves its purpose well.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the entire cast chips in with serviceable inputs and even though the characters they play lack an interesting persona & certain amount of depth, the actors somehow succeed in making the audience get on board with their characters' predicament. While everyone does an apt job in their given roles, there really was no need to add a despicable human character when you already have a train full of zombies so that felt a bit forced.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Train to Busan still makes up for an exciting, action-packed zombie horror and boasts numerous sequences of sustained terror. The build-up is quick and once the train begins to move, it becomes all the more relentless & unstoppable. A few shortcomings like numerous stupid decisions made by a few characters does rob it of its uniqueness but there is no denying that Train to Busan delivers a healthy dose of adrenaline-filled extravaganza until the very end."
"witster18","8","6","14","14 December 2016"," Without Question Belongs With the Best the Genre Has to Offer - mild spoiler
","It isn't perfect. Some of the CGI could be tightened-up just a bit. <br/><br/>THere.<br/><br/>That is the only criticism I can think of.<br/><br/>""Train to Busan"" is a superlative zombie film. Most films in this genre suffer from unrealistic and inconsistent moments. Well, it's a zombie movie so I guess calling it unrealistic is a bit moronic, but you know what I mean. The zombies acting inconsistently, or other stuff that just doesn't make sense. No character arcs, or many unfinished subplots and forgotten references also seem to be common weaknesses with these types of films. NOT HERE.<br/><br/>This film does nearly everything flawlessly. It does follow a cookie-cutter template, but the Koreans follow that template and create a near perfect zombie film.<br/><br/>The pacing is fantastic. The set-up is slow and methodical but effective, the build-up accelerates like a ZR1, and the stretch run has you glued oooey-blueey to the flat-screen. The characters are perfect, blending seamlessly and falling perfectly into the storyline of the film. The main roles are acted to perfection but I keep going back to the consistencies of this film that make it so great. Every moment when I anticipated an inconsistent action or scene - it failed to come. Instead, it handles every transition, every character, and every zombie tradition with painstaking care. <br/><br/>The actions of the zombies and characters, and the timelines, set-structure and locations are laid out perfectly.<br/><br/>Now, I'm sure there are many great films to come on my 2016 watchlist. I have 47 of 89 films still to watch, and many of the higher anticipated films are sitting in the un-watched portion. But, for now, ""Train to Busan"" joins ""Hell or High Water"", ""Deadpool"", ROgue One"", and ""Zootopia"" as my favorite films of 2016 so far. It's right in the same class as ""28 Days Later"", ""Return of the Living Dead"", ""Shaun of the Dead"", and ""Pontypool"" for me. Truly. An instant rewatch. A next day Blu-ray purchase(if avail today - hmmm). <br/><br/>The film, despite some small CGI shortcomings, is better than most in that respect, and the overall look is still great. The film doesn't tackle some of the normal eradication subplots, and I think the movie is better for it. While the template might be basic, the execution and flow is anything but.<br/><br/>This is one of the best Zombie movies ever made. I wouldn't be surprised if this 7.6 current rating climbs a nitch and settles around 7.7-7.8. It's a solid 8/10 for me, and may honestly be the best zombie movie I've ever seen. It certainly gives ""Night of the Living Dead"", and a couple of others(ROTLD,SOTD, PONTY, 28, DOTD,RE-Anim) a run for their money.<br/><br/>Flat-out AWESOME zombie-flick. If this is your bag - I would save the rental money and just buy it - you won't regret the decision or the savings.<br/><br/>No need for a ""you'd like this if you liked"" list... 84/100<br/><br/>It's not scary... it's just really, really entertaining.. and makes recent American Zombie flicks look pretty awful if you ask me."

Unlike in American counterpart where the scare factor are heavily dependent on graphics ( blowing zombies brains, victims eaten alive with their insides hanging out on their tummy , explosion , etc) TTB zombies looks like just wounded people with seizure and cataract (but they bites!) which is refreshing. Actually Its funny that even some of them are already infected, they still good looking! I don't know if that's a good thing or a biggest flaw for a zombie flick. After I watched it, I suddenly have urge to binge on zombie themed movies. So I learned that TTB MIGHT similar to quarantine where people trap inside airplane instead!

","Yes we have all seen zombie movies blah blah blah... but what grabs me in a movie is the fine line between smart characters, dumb characters, the ones that should die, and the ones you never guessed would die so soon. Basically all the characters are dumb.<br/><br/>What do you do when you find out zombies cant see in the dark but are attracted to sound on a train? (Raises hand) I know! Crawl through the luggage compartments...... stupid. Things like this happen constantly in this movie Zombies are rushing your way what do you do? Stand there and stare at each other then run at the last minute. Or how about the time the main character closed the door on the pregnant couple when clearly he didn't have to close the damn door right away, but that just shows that he actually is a careless butt hole. Then the fat guy holds off a horde of zombies by himself and trying to shut a door while the other two dummies are trying to break in the opposite end. No common sense, they could help the fat guy first than worry about the next thing. mind you one of them even tried to call his girlfriend who was on the opposite side of the door. This movie has tons of moments were I just wanted to kick my TV in and toss it out the window. My friends and I were constantly chanting ""just die. Everyone just f****ING die."" The acting sucked, the little girl was the best act in the movie. Good job little girl, everyone else sucked. The funny part of the movie is when all the zombies somehow slowed down the locomotive, then when they get kicked off, you can clearly see that they're on some kind of ""boogie board"" bad way to spend money. I guess they didn't have enough money to just cgi that scene. I will never watch this movie again unless i want to sit somewhere and waste 2 hours of my life....... again."

They run, they swarm. Nothing original but its used to good effect as is the character development of the (still) human characters. 8/10"

","Fantastic riff on World War Z, Train To Busan never lets up long enough for you to catch your breath once it gets going. The movie's gore is surprisingly tame, but it's so well placed that you might think it's bloodier than it actually is.<br/><br/>At its core, it's actually a beautiful film about a father reconnecting with his daughter after he spends most of his time chasing his career rather than caring for his family. It's exciting, tragic, and often heroic as he fights to get his daughter to safety. I can honestly say it's the first zombie movie that made me both bite my nails AND cry at the same time. It's more action than horror, but when that action is meshed with suspense and horror it's an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride. See it."
"t-hunt910","8","2","3","14 January 2019"," Well worth seeking out this South Korean Zombie epic.
","Train to Busan makes most zombie film look pedestrian in comparison. While you average zombie film moves along like a car stuck on the M25, this movie moves along like a Porsche on high-speed racetrack.
The director throws every thing at the movie including the kitchen sink. Like all great movies you really care about the characters, which makes the hyperactive, never let up ending almost unbearable to watch.
Its 2 half hour running time allows the script to include every plot device seen in most recent zombie movies. But most importantly it never drags. Its claustrophobic setting allows the director to pull off some unique moments of crisis. Also GCI and stunt team do a very good job here.
Highly recommended not just by me but by the director of Sean of the dead no less, how can you go wrong."

"Wolfgang-Fuertner","8","2","3","13 October 2018"," well produced melodramatic zombiemovie full of action
","Very good produced zombie movie with supreme camera work.
this film offers a pleasent variety of emotional scenes and very suspensefull action scenes where the passengers try to fight the threat of the zombies and escape the chaos.
main acters and dialoges beneath the chaos are very authentic and well played.
of course this genre doesnt allow a deeper look into the relationsheep of the passengers. nevertheless the sideplot fillins are very well placed. at the beginning of the movie dialoges seem a little exaggerate emotional, but the longer the zombie threat lasts, the more the main family fights its way to the heart of the observer, only possible due to the zombie virus threating there life's.
As good and authentic as the main acters may be, sidecast zombie actors are not authentic and in some scenes one truely can see how the actors have fun playing those zombies. unuasual about this zombie movie is, that the zombies seem to have a fast motion pace, which makes it even harder for the passengers to shake them off. All in all this film leaves a mark due to the very good production and tension, shock moments, and emotional sequences. the storyline could have been a little bit more extended and sideplot dialogues could have been a little bit more lively and longer, wheres the zombies could have been a little bit less lively in my point of view. nevertheless the emotional dialogues and melodramatic sequences this film shows leaves a mark in ones mind and heart and makes this film mezmerizing."

"iTeleb","8","2","3","24 February 2018"," Simply amazing
","Hello,<br/><br/>First, I'd like to mention that this is my first time writing a review and second time watching a foreign movie.<br/><br/>The movie's plot is about a virus that breaks out in South Korea (obviously) whilst our main character and his daughter board a train to get to Busan, hence the movie name, so the daughter can see her mother. 
In the first 25 minutes of the movie nothing of interest happens, but a few scenes that won't make you adjust your seating. Highlights are an infected girl entering the train and (presumably) the president giving a speech on national TV, trying to calm the citizens and telling them that there are no zombies, just aggressive/violent people + the introduction of a married couple.
Fast-forward, the train is now full of infected people and the train has to stop at Daejeon where they will be quarantined, but the train passengers are unaware, which made me confused why won't you tell them that they will be quarantined; I mean at leas they know they will be safe? Why would the train stop even that they did not see any military personnel. why wouldn't the conductor try to recontact the command center?
Anyhow, people re-board the train and several thrill and drama packed fights happen as the survivors are split onto 3 different cars and try to reunite.
Another interesting point for me here: when the husband of the pregnant wife was trying to hold close the door, why didn't anyone just try to cover it as they know the infected people would become passive after it? The husband ends up dead in a drama of sacrifice for the sake of his wife and other survivors. Moving on to the next scene after the rest of the survivors manage to regroup in the last car, they were despised by the other group and obeyed their request to leave, which was weird as they were the much stronger group + armed with bats + they just finished fighting like 20 infected people. You can clearly see the hate of Seok Woo when he looks at the COO of the railroad company (remember this scene).<br/><br/>The train later stops because of a blockage caused by containers even though I don't see a cargo train nearby. The conductor disembarks and tells other survivors to meet at the far left railroad. 
The COO of the company again sacrifices another person (the conductor in this case) so he can survive.
Now, Seok Woo meets the COO on the locomotive but he is still scared and passive, and a very weak fight scene takes place which results in our hero putting his hand in the infected COO's mouth for some reason. Hero gets infected, sacrifices himself, his daughter lives along with the pregnant woman yay!<br/><br/>To put this short, Train to Busan put me in an amazing mood as I adore South Korea, but there many situations that I find weird, especially the COO fighting the father! That guy just made you lose your friends and is an egoist bastard, then he even tries to attack your daughter while he is infected, all that and all you can do is Ugh and Ahh?! Maybe I am not familiar with the South Korean culture and that they're peaceful by nature, but still the adrenaline rush would've helped.
Train to Busan literally feels like a trip through Korea and emotions for me even though you don't see much, but you don't feel like an outcast, you still feel heavily related to the characters and location, but I believe that the director could've made the death of Jin Hii more dramatic as they looked like an interesting couple. I appraise the fact that it wasn't an all pink everyone survives ending, you rarely see that these days.
I hope the sequel focuses more on the damage done to the cities and people, and makes you deeply related with 2 or 3 characters only instead of mildly interested in all of them."
"bob the moo","Null","2","3","1 July 2017"," Solid horror which is intensely, well-paced, and does well with the characters, even if it is not as perfect as the hype suggests
","A lot of hype about this zombie film, and while I normally do not like these types of films (because they scare me), I decided to watch it. The plot sees a distant father escorting his young daughter back to her mother in Busan when some sort of outbreak occurs, and an infected gets onto the train. From there the film sees the infection spread across the train as an increasingly small group of survivors try to hold on in the hope that some stop will provide safety. In terms of narrative it is pretty straightforward, although at the same time it is a very limited space to make the action last for almost 2 hours â€“ particularly since the zombies are more or less unstoppable.<br/><br/>The film uses some convenience with vision to give the characters some breathing room, but mostly it does this by making us care about the characters. While they are essentially fairly obvious genre standards in the main, they are reasonably well done to make us care for them and invest in their struggle. This adds weight to the stakes and the decisions made. The film uses this well, and delivers a pretty well paced film. I thought that it was just a touch longer than it needed to be, but it comes in waves, with nice touches of respite along with intense scenes of attacks and chases. With this the writing does well to come up with different ways to have the zombies almost about to attack quite often â€“ whether it be cracking glass, the dark of a tunnel, or so on. The emotional side of the film runs alongside this, and it is surprisingly affecting at times, although some key scenes at the end are a bit marred by the rather heavy use of music.<br/><br/>The film does have blood and horror, but it is nicely light on the gore aspect; I dislike horror films which make a point of giving us real good looks at gore. Instead Busanhaeng lets the pace and tension and characters do the work, and I often found the pressure to be almost too much. The cast play well to this, whether it be the fear and regret of Yoo Gong or the gruffly likable Dong-seok Ma; even those playing more generic characters worked well enough to make it play. <br/><br/>The film has received a lot of hype though, and this probably doesn't help it. It is a very good zombie movie, which does well to have plenty or horror but also delivers characters we feel for and want to survive, however it is still a zombie movie and mostly does just what you'd guess it will do â€“ albeit that it does it well."

","A motley assortment of passengers on a train going from Seoul to Bosun are put in great jeopardy when they find themselves caught up in a sudden zombie outbreak both on said train and in the outside world as well.<br/><br/>Director/co-writer Sang-ho Yeon keeps the gripping story hurtling along at a breathless breakneck pace, takes time to develop the characters, ably builds a tremendous amount of nerve-rattling tension, maintains a tough take-no-prisoners tone throughout, and stages the attack scenes with rousing go-for-the-throat gusto. Most importantly, Yeon and co-writer Joo-Suk Park bring a surprising pronounced element of pathos and humanity to the premise which in turn ensures that there's plenty of genuinely moving heart to go along with all the harrowing horror. The excellent acting by the tip-top cast further keeps the film on track, with especially stand-out contributions from Yoo Gong as negligent workaholic dad Seok-woo, Su-an Kim as his estranged daughter Soo-an, Dong-seok Ma as the brave Sang-hwa, Yu-mi Jung as the pregnant Seong-Kyeong, Eui-sung Kim as selfish business tycoon Yon-suk, Gwi-hwa Choi as a scared homeless guy, and Sohee as perky cheerleader Jin-hee. The infected folks are extremely ferocious and frightening. Proof positive that there's still some invigorating life left in the zombie horror genre."
"jsullivan-50724","10","1","1","28 October 2019"," Actually really good
","It's really a great movie, disregard the people dumbing it down.
I'm honestly appalled at all these shallow reviews. When a horror movie actually has depth, you're doing a disservice when you just babble about one girl who's barely in it. This ain't some silly slasher. Y'all are weird for focusing on a girl who gets maybe 10 minutes of screen time during a 2 hour movie, and you're just distracting from the fact that this is a zombie movie that is actually GOOD.<br/><br/>Even though it ends up using one of my most hated tropes, this movie is pretty damn good. If you're completely sick of the genre, then maybe not so much. It's gotten difficult over the past decade to make a unique zombie movie, so there are always going to be familiar elements. But, it does focus on a child-parent scenario, which is not used in zombie movies very often (this invoked some of the same feelings as the short film Cargo), and the action is pretty constant so no one can really say it's boring. It definitely exceeded expectations."

"kluseba","10","7","18","25 January 2017"," The best zombie movie ever made so far
","There have been numerous stereotypical, repetitive and gruesome zombie movies since the beginning of the millennium and now South Korea has officially jumped on the bandwagon... and revolutionized the entire genre with the very best movie of its kind.<br/><br/>""Train to Busan"" convinces on every single level. The settings are diversified and very well chosen and the gripping atmosphere is pushed forward by the idea of a few random passengers being caught on a train with a horde of zombies. The cinematography is perfectly balanced between intense close-ups and larger angles. There are almost no shaky camera passages as opposed to the disappointing contemporary Hollywood standard. The story finds the right path between brutal intensity and great acting skills. The film is never slowing down and highly intriguing from the very first until the very last scene.<br/><br/>What really makes this zombie movie stand out even compared to the better genre flicks is the depth and diversity of the intriguing characters that are perfectly portrayed by skilled actresses and actors. We get to meet a busy and divorced hedge fund manager and his estranged daughter who is desperately trying to get his attention. We follow the actions of a tough, honest and brave working-class man and his more serious pregnant wife. We are introduced to two old sisters with an intense connection who are inseparable. We meet a naive cheerleader and the baseball player she has a crush on and witness how they mature and become adults within just a few hours. The movie also has a strong antagonist in form of a pitiless chief executive officer who will do anything to survive. I have rarely watched a movie with so many addicting, authentic and profound characters. A special shout- out goes to child actress Kim Su-an who is more convincing in her role in this single film than many ambitious adult actresses in Hollywood in their entire careers.<br/><br/>One has to be aware of the fact that this isn't a Hollywood movie. This movie doesn't try to be politically correct by adding a character of each possible visible minority in the world to the cast but we get a refreshingly realistic portrait of South Korean citizens fighting for survival instead. The film doesn't have a deeper philosophical meaning or tries to explain the zombie outbreak in melancholic images and words because this movie simply focuses on the dangerous situation where the characters don't have any time to over-analyze the situation. The sympathetic heroes of the story won't necessarily survive at the end of the movie and the last half hour includes several shocking and heartbreaking moments that will get you emotionally involved without being pathetic.<br/><br/>In the end, there isn't anything negative to say about this movie that mixes horror, drama and action elements to what might be the best zombie movie of all times. If you haven't watched this movie, you have missed out on one of the greatest movies of the past few years. Along with the stunning South Korean horror film ""The Wailing"", the epic ""Train to Busan'' is the best film of the year 2016."

"baehr_adam","10","6","15","8 November 2016"," Snowpiercer Zombie Style!!!
","OMG I just got out from watching what I believe to be the Greatest Zombie Film Ever Created. I will explain why I feel this way lol. I have seen a ton of Zombie films since ""Night of the Living Dead"" all the way to ""World War Z"" and in-between. My favorites up until this point were ""28 Days Later"" and the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and being the horror movie buff that I'm I take pride in knowing I have seen a lot of movies. I will now start my review. The story is about a man who is taking his daughter to see her mom on a train when a virus breaks out all over South Korea. The premise is simple which makes the movie that much more agreeable. The acting was honestly great with the three main leads played by Yoo Gong who plays the father Seok Woo as well as the daughter played by Soo-an Kim and finally the heavy hitter Dong-seok Ma who has almost as much screen time as the father. The other actors did fantastic as well. The action is where this movie shines. I mean it was honestly as if ""28 days later"" and ""World War Z"" had a baby set in the Snowpiercer setting. The action was visceral and exhilarating. The zombie effects were top-notch and the blood was not too chaotic to the point of being unrealistic mind you this is a zombie film. The action was the Star in this film just to be clear with many scenes from ""Snowpiercer"" and ""World War Z"" being displayed here but what is used in better fashion in my opinion. The cinematography was Excellent and every scene both in the build-up scenes and the mayhem were shot with perfection. I didn't notice one hitch. The location they filmed in was Superb. I will close by saying that I may be biased and love Korean films ever since ""Oldboy"" released but please don't let you not liking to read subtitles be the reason that you miss such a monumental film in the zombie genre pass you by so to speak. The director Sang-ho Yeon deserves an Oscar for his directing of this Breathtaking Masterpiece. The film is also at times very emotional and heartbreaking but it has some of the slickest fight scenes in a zombie film to date."

"KateHawthorne","9","5","12","24 December 2016"," One of the Best Zomie Movies in a Very Long Time
","It is going to be hard to review this movie without adding spoilers, but here goes: <br/><br/>I rarely watch Korean or any films with subtitles because I usually watch movies or television while doing something else. But I had read so many good things about Train to Busan, and it was Christmas Eve, so I put down all my other things and watched. What a thrill ride this movie is! There isn't much wrong with this movie and if I told you why I dropped a star from 10, it would be a spoiler!! This movie is The Walking Dead when it was new, before action and bad guys took over from the character development and relationships of beloved characters. <br/><br/>I was entranced from the first scene. Everything in this movie is excellent. The characters are very well developed and you get attached to them. The directing is just about perfect. The layout from beginning to end is exactly what I look for in any movie. Intelligence, action, strong characters, nearly perfect flow from scene to scene. While I know most people will put this in the Zombie Apocalypse category, I beg to differ. This movie would fit in Action Adventure, Thriller, and Sci Fi just as well. While the film is about zombies, this is a much bigger movie. <br/><br/>If you like Action Adventure and Thrillers and don't mind or can even keep an open mind about zombies, I highly recommend Train to Buran. Even if you object to subtitles, I can attest that shortly into the film, you won't even notice them. Which means you won't see a Korean film with subtitles, you will watch a movie that is simply very entertaining, even a little humor thrown in, and it will absorb you to the point that your surroundings fade and you find yourself living in this movie. That is my highest praise that I can give any movie I see. That it supersedes all boundaries and delivers a movie where you don't think of it as a foreign movie or a genre movie or a movie about politics or causes you are tired of having jammed down your throats, or politically correct language, when you just want to get away from the everyday news or your job or your health or family squabbles. And it got almost 10 stars because it fulfills that list with excellent acting and breathtaking excitement. <br/><br/>One more thought: even the many movies I watch that can catch me and pull me in, often there is some mistake or ungainly slow period or a moment that fits in the story from the Producers or directors eye, but causes a momentary glitch in my captivation of said movie. I can't remember one moment that took me out of the movie and brought me back to reality. Just a suggestion, get all bathroom breaks and snacks out of the way before you sit down and start watching Train to Buran. <br/><br/>And, yes, a little fear is earnestly felt now and again, also. Watch this movie!! It really is worth paying for. And movies like this, in my humble opinion, are few and far between these days!"

","Train To Busan is simply one of the best films I've seen this year, and probably the best Zombie movie since 28 Days Later. One of the strongest elements in the film is the screenplay, it works so damn good, giving each character enough time to develop and at the same time keeping us on the edge of our seats with every scene. this movie plays like a video game every level is a scene, and with every level the protagonists go through it gets even harder and more complicated. the actors did an incredible job, I swear to god I nearly cried a couple of times during the run time of the film. Overall this is a very exciting and emotional ride, it's clever with it's pace and character development, the action scenes were brilliantly executed although I don't remember the protagonists killing a single zombie during the entirety of the movie, it also offers a good little twist on the zombie genre, it looks like it was there to serve the advancement of the plot but it's really clever and it worked well. bring some tissues along with you to theater, i dare you not to cry at least once when you see it. 9/10"

What am I missing? That's about three minutes of quality movie. A Movie Trailer's worth. And like a movie trailer it's a terrible representation of the film overall--where the other 99% is a T-bomb.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film is defecating: Zombies run into a door that's being closed; everyone takes a dump. Lather rinse repeat. The pacing is bad because the writing and acting are awful. ""But you're not supposed to have writing and acting in a zombie movie!"" That's right. So why shove it in our faces? Jung Yu-Mi gets a pass, and I liked the little girl. Ma Dong-Seok doesn't embarrass himself too much because he's strong enough to overcome what he's given. Every line of dialog in the film is bad. Gong Yoo is a twerpy faux-stud who can't act his way out of a genre film. I hope to never watch another film with his over-moisturized face.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for this. The three minutes of quality film are fantastic. End of story. Well, actually I like the Korean thing of killing everyone, although I'm not saying if the kid dies or not (like the one in *The Host* did). Korea might be inching toward doing Hollywood better than Hollywood, but it's still crap. I, and I can't believe I'm saying this, enjoyed *The Happening* (2008) more than this. Heck, I enjoyed a Woody Harrelson movie more than this."

","It was a good action film, a very good zombie film. But lacked the quirkiness or charm of the best Korean films. It had great characters, good acting (especially the daughter), believable story line, excellent suspense, and pacing. So what was wrong with it? I believe it just comes down to the mental age of the film which is about 19."

","Another zombie movie? Yes, and Yeon Sang-ho's ""Busanhaeng"" (""Train to Busan"" in English) is a cool one. The plot involves a zombie apocalypse overrunning South Korea, while a group of train passengers tries to contain the infected passengers. Just as most zombie movies give their living dead unique attributes, this one does: the zombies can't see in the dark, so they have to rely on their hearing (meaning that the living can sneak past silently when the train passes through tunnels).<br/><br/>It's not a masterpiece, but fun. I suspect that it's fun to play zombies, or whatever the infected people are supposed to be. The subplot about the absentee father and his daughter trying to reconnect gave the movie a more human side than most zombie movies out there. I hope that Yeon continues making movies like this."
"Reno-Rangan","8","4","9","24 January 2017"," Horror express.
","A week ago I saw a zombie film from Japan called 'I Am a Hero' and now this Korean. I have not seen a quality zombie film at the recent time. The second tier films like 'Cooties', 'Freaks of Nature', 'Scouts Guide...', all these were comedies. Probably 'World War Z' was the last decent zombie film I have seen and after that this is the one. So the timing of the film was another advantage. Since there's no competition, this zombie film rules. And not to forget the Korean style, they are among the best thriller film makers today.<br/><br/>Directed by an Anime filmmaker, this is his first live-action film. When I decided to watch it, I thought it would be another Korean film, which rely on father-daughter sentiments. You know I kind of tired of that Korean clichÃ© where at the final stage they let the kid sob and call it a twist. Initially I enjoyed those and later on getting bored of that. With that kind of reasons, I would have missed it. Being a film fanatic, I won't mind to risk a watch, except give up writing a review for it.<br/><br/>But in this case, it was completely different. Even the characters, any characters in the film, either in the lead or the supporting ones, all are unpredictable. That's the biggest plus point of the film. At the end you won't be sure, who you were rooting for. You know in those edgy scenes, we blindly back the one we like. You will think you can guess the upcoming scenes, but the writing was very smartly done. Feels like they did not care about a sequel, if this meets a greater success. But who knows, this is a cinema and there were many mysteries kept unsolved, so they can pick up from one of those loops.<br/><br/>""Whatever you do, you must finish what you start. It's worse than not doing it at all.""<br/><br/>This is the story of a divorced, workaholic father and his young daughter. After the progress, many others join them. On her birthday, they decide to visit her mother in Busan. On their train, soon after it took off, they come to know that something is wrong around. With all the chaos unrolling rapidly, a group of survivours gathers in a car since there's no escape as they are trapped in a moving train. How their journey ends, whether they reach a safe place with the fight against the living dead, the narration comes to halt.<br/><br/>In the contest of good versus evil, there's no place for sentiments. But at one stage, near the end they cleared the place to attach one. In that final scene you can't resist, even if you are not an emotional person when it comes to the film. As I mentioned earlier that is the part I feared the most would come, but i did not hate it in the context of story development. Because that was a perfect setting to take the story to the next level. <br/><br/>There are several twists. Those are from the film characters' perspective than the story wise. They did not bother to tell about the cause of the epidemic. Instead, this film was focused on the train passengers and their fight for survival when the defending options are limited. Just imagine it is a zombie version of another Korean film 'Snowpiercer' or like 'Snakes on a Plane'.<br/><br/>I have heard there's another film, an animation which is also directed by the same filmmaker and said to be a prequel to this one. If you had liked it, you would be itching to watch that one as well. Hope I would watch it as soon as I get an opportunity. So, my view on it, the film is very good. It was close to two hours long, but once the train journey begins, you won't going to notice the time. I am saying the pace of the film, as well as the events make you dissolve in it completely and forget everything else. This is the best zombie film right now and you should not miss it, especially if you like this theme. Recommended!<br/><br/>8/10"
"jim-94764","9","4","9","24 January 2017"," Excellent Zombie Flick
","First off, don't watch the trailer! If you're a fan of Korean cinema and modern zombies, just get straight to the film. The film has several genuinely good 'Oh my god' eye-budging moments for the viewer and they spoil some of those in the trailer.<br/><br/>The film truly captures the stress, and anxiety of a WWZ zombie scenario. You agonize over the vulnerability of the survivors, especially when there's no Zeds in sight. It gets going fast, builds the characters surprisingly well considering they get little exposition, and kinda just keeps going on full steam for 2 captivating hours.<br/><br/>It's not exactly all on a train, either. That premise put me off slightly as I thought it might get a little stale, or perhaps they were on a budget. But no, there's more to it. And even one or two original ideas, believe it or not.<br/><br/>This film takes no prisoners. It's brutal and sad, but somehow keeps a certain charm. It has the most adorable child actor - who performs brilliantly imo - and whilst she's a weaknesses for the survivors, never feels like a burden to the story. You will be rooting for them at the teary end."

It really connects with each character of the story and also teaches high moral lessons in the time of dire consequences. It clearly shows each characters mindset and how they react to the situation. The protagonist's (Father-Daughter)story is very emotional and touches all the right chords of feelings.

","Well, this was a refreshing zombie flick, not ""horror"" or ""terror"" at all. I cannot figure out why it is reviewed as ""the scariest movie of the year"", it's not scary at all. Unless you are scared by Hello Kitty, or Asians. <br/><br/>The origin of the plague is plausible and makes sense, we get just the necessary insight to know what happened. <br/><br/>Character development is pretty good, taking into account it's a zombie movie and most of them die anyway. <br/><br/>The first act of the movie sets a good pace, and then goes on with non stop action and, most important, plausible situations given the context of a Z apocalypse in a train. <br/><br/>Loved/hated the ""Bad Guy"", one would expect most of humans will think and act like him. <br/><br/>The little girl's acting in the end is very moving, 10/10. <br/><br/>The ending for the good guy is a little dumb, he could have taken, at least in theory, that Z with no effort, he did it many times before, doesn't make sense. But, had he survived, the movie's ending would have been cheesy. So, in the long run, a good thing he died. <br/><br/>Koreans are doing a great job delivering better and better movies, I really think this one is in the top 10 or 20 Z movies, and gives fresh air to a genre that has been flushed down the toilet recently."

","If you want to understand how far the quality of horror movies, and cinema in general, have disintegrated over the years, just watch one of these new-age, current movies, back to back with something like ""Return of the Living Dead,"" (1985.) or ""The Beyond"" (1981). The decline in quality of our entertainment is sad and astonishing. ""Road To Busang"" is another modern zombie movie, utterly indiscernible from all the other current horror crap, with it's flat, cheap cinematography, fake looking CGI, and this desperate need these current zombie films seem to all have, in bringing emotional drama into a genre where it is laughably out of place and just ludicrous. Some exciting zombie chase scenes are present and the large cast is impressive, but we have seen it before, in movies like ""28 Days Later."" Honestly, there is nothing new here, and the only outstanding quality is that little girl, who gives quite an impressive performance in this. On a side note, all the raves and compliments showered upon a cast member who played a cheerleader, made me curious to see what all the fuss was about. Imagine how shocked I was to see the ""Goddess"" is actually some little girl with thin, stringy black hair that looks like a cheap wig for a witch costume, legs like toothpicks and the facial features of a down syndrome victim. Is this the current idea of beauty? Did anyone else wonder where her chin went? Maybe it got eaten by zombies. It seems like the beauty standards have gone down the sewer, along with popular taste in film and music. I find this a bit sad. ""Train To Busan"" is one of those popcorn flicks that you watch once while texting on your phone...something that you forget 5 minutes after you see it. I refer to the majority of current films and music as ""throwaway entertainment."" Nobody is going to be talking about this movie 2 years from now...nobody will even remember it. I also doubt that anyone over the age of 18 that has more than 5 brain cells will think highly of this extended TV show."

","Train to Busan is hard to put a pin in. Half of the time it plays like one of the most developed and enthralling zombie films to date, but the other half it plays like a B movie. Act I is rock solid through and through. The rules of the virus and the world it is in were laid on the line clear as day, following a respectable amount of time spent developing our main characters. The rest of the film is plagued by inconsistency with how the virus and the characters behave, which ultimately cripples the film. Even with this hindrance, Train to Busan is not an action film to miss."

","What starts off as something interesting quickly descends into just another zombie movie, where the zombies move fast and the plague turns people into zombies faster. So one chomp and evidently the zombies aren't hungry for you any more as you are one of them. Makes you wonder what all the fuss is about since all you seem to have to do is tape their mouths shut or stuff a sock into it.<br/><br/>Virus outbreak zombie movies seem to fall into 2 camps, those with slow moving zombies and those with olympic sprinters. These are the latter. Despite epic levels of speed, they are blind in the ""just dark enough"" passages. Again, makes you think all you have to do is wait for dark, I mean dusk, and duct tape them all, threat neutralized.<br/><br/>I was willing to look over all of these shortcomings because you do find yourself caring about most of the characters presented. But then came the last 20 minutes where it was just so overdone and stupid that I had to write a review saying so. The ending is overly dramatic and totally predictable and immensely underwhelming. It really makes the previous time spent watching the film feel as totally wasted. Despite the high praise of many reviewers, I cannot echo those sentiments and think there are much better zombie movie alternatives out there."

","About Time! All my life I wanted a real zombie film! In seconds they cemented the rules here! THey see you In light. Clear as day! In The walking dead they still haven't set the rules down after 7 seasons! and I still wonder what makes the zombies tick. Everything seems to apply there, They come towards you if they spot flames? if they here sound, their blood doesn't affect you if you get it in the eyes etc. THey smell you? It's different tricks I get that, but TWD clearly doesn't know themselves. As many others I've seen countless of zombie films, better for worse. All these parodies that sucked so bad,Not fun at all. THe old occult 70s zombie flicks I love! but they are more summoned by ancient powers and a bit tame in the practical effect department. but it ain't what I've been craving for. evil dead and re animator, planet terror are more demonic etc etc, Train to busan gets it right In seconds. Its a joyride finish to end. ALl the actors play their part perfectly for what the script gave them. It may be a little lighthearted and not gory at all. But that wasn't the intention here i believe. It's a zombie film to just sit back, drink a cup of coffee and enjoy. and for what it does. It's excellent. The only little thing I can complain about is the world war z cgi piles. Even if many other zombie films does something better here and there. many of them have great set design or really badass zombies but they falter big time through the rest with some silly side story or a super boss zombie demon or some other crap. Train to Busan Is by far the most perfect zombie film I ever seen."
"fikamugg","9","3","6","9 April 2017"," This is a masterpiece
","If Hollywood ever decides to remake this title my advice to the audience is clear: DON'T BOTHER! It has been a while since i saw a really good movie. A movie that can compete for the 20 best or so list but Train to Busan not only made me smile it also impressed me on many levels. It's without a doubt the best modern zombie movie since 28 days later. The story and the script are well crafted and the characters are likable just like in 28 days later. The zombies are running, thank god.<br/><br/>7 seasons with the walking dead has not only nearly bored me to death it has also made me realize how important it is that zombies in a zombie flick are really frightening and not some stupid dead meat you can whack half sleeping. The zombies and the effects in Train to Busan have the touch of a major studio production, which in itself of course is not a guarantee for success. Who doesn't remember the miserable effects in I am legend? Also 28 days later did not have a particularly big budget but succeeded anyway, so its not about the money, rather the quality, and the quality in TTB is top notch. The zombie-crowd scenes for instance feels more believable and well made compared with World War Z even though the comparison is not 100% since the zombie crowd-scenes in WWZ were massively crowded.<br/><br/>I can't find many weak points even the music appears in the right places and adds something, especially at the end when the story takes a sad turn. The only minus comes with the choice of a train as the center piece of the story. On the surface TTB shows similarities with a movie like Flight of the living dead. But the zombies on a plane - zombies on a train duality is just a play with words. The comparison of the two films is unfair. With splendid actors and more complex layer of emotions TTB has ambitions other than to make you laugh. Despite the unsexy choice of playground TTB is running for 1.57 and you won't even notice. Just another sign of how good this bad-ass Korean zombie film is."
"lord-blade","10","3","6","13 January 2017"," This is how you make a zombie movie.
","Hollywood will throw millions at special effects and give you an endless gorefest, and still fail to deliver a truly gripping zombie movie. Train to Busan is a zombie movie that delivers on all levels.<br/><br/>First off, the zombies are excellent. No super over the top effects, just some simple veiny makeup and contacts, and you have clear infected and the actors movements just sell the rest. Keep your massively overpriced Hollywood zombies that look like they belong in a movie and enjoy a true horde of undead that actually make you feel like there's no way to survive.<br/><br/>Secondly, the movie has heart. It has believable characters that show the range of reactions you would find in real people. There's the self made heroes, the reluctant heroes, the people just trying to survive, the frightened mobs, and of course, the jackasses that will throw anyone they can under the bus (or zombie) in order to try and keep themselves safe. Add to that the truly emotional moments in the film. There are scenes that are simply emotionally painful to watch because of how well done and authentic they come across. None of that Hollywood cheese that tries to slap you in the face with a cardboard emotional scene and tells you to feel sad. This movie shows you how real people react and the actors make you feel like you're the one feeling the feels.<br/><br/>For people who want a great zombie movie, this is one you can't miss. It also wins top points with those looking for great survival stories, or the drama of dealing with everything going wrong and trying to find some ray of hope. This should be the blueprint that all movies should use to know how to make a quality film."

","The movie was entertaining, but annoying and often incomprehensible. The infection starts on the train basically because the first two individuals to encounter the infected woman were apparently deaf. For some reason the train usher or whatever didn't hear the infected woman slam onto the train behind him, and the stewardess didn't hear the infected woman getting back up behind here. There were a lot of people standing or sitting watching things happen in front of them. Infected fell from helicopters and got back up without broken limbs. The concept that the infected completely can't sense people simply because they're in slight darkness is a bit ridiculous. The baseball boy sat holding his infected girlfriend and got himself killed by her, how romantic, but stupid, and to be expected from a Korean production. The older woman opening the door to the infected because...she went crazy? I don't know. Just seemed like a way to kill off the rest of the passengers. The father putting his hand over the infected man's mouth was absurd, but heroic and cliché. <br/><br/>Overall this movie was frustrating to watch. It was filled with logic errors, and needless actions for emotional impact and to move the plot along. I thought this movie would change my mind about the poor quality of the Asian movie industry, but I was sadly mistaken. It was still entertaining though, so a 6/10 it is."

Finally, I had the time to go to the theater to watch it, and now I'm reviewing it.<br/><br/>Story: 8<br/><br/>The story of Train to Busan is basically just surviving the train ride. There wasn't really much of an explanation on how the infection started, but it's all good. The story revolves around Soo- an and her dad, and later with the other passengers. The story progression was decent. It was intense, calm, thrilling and emotional when it needed to be. Very well done.<br/><br/>Cinematography: 10<br/><br/>It was visually amazing. The effects on the zombie chase/battle, the blood, the look of the zombies, the camera angles- they were all really good! I saw a behind-the-scenes video on YouTube and I was amazed. I really liked the camera angles! The acting of the actors and actresses was also something to behold.<br/><br/>Sound: 10<br/><br/>This goes hand-in-hand with the cinematography. It was also intense, calm, thrilling and emotional when it needed. The sound effects were properly utilized and meshed together. The emotions that the characters feel can also be felt through their voices.<br/><br/>Characterization: 9<br/><br/>All the characters were interesting (even that evil CEO/COO guy). There are many emotions to the characters, and each of them (or each group) have their own way of survival. The character development of the main group (especially Soo-an and her dad) was splendid. I do feel that they killed too many characters ( I wanted Soo-an's dad and the pregnant woman's husband to survive- sorry I'm bad at remembering names) but I guess I just got attached to them.<br/><br/>Overall: 10<br/><br/>I loved this movie. I think the Good Stuff outweighed the Flaws that the movie had. It's not perfect but it was damn near close to it (in my opinion). It didn't scare me, but it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the intense parts, and got my eyes watery in that ending. Overall a very fun and entertaining ""train-ride"". Definitely worth the hype.<br/><br/>Note: This is my first review. I'm new to this stuff so maybe I just gave this one a 10 due to my enjoyment. Either way, I hope it was helpful.

","I hate to say this because I have positive expectation towards this movie since several of my friends recommended it and told me this was good. Yet, here I am writing a bad review about this. One of the reason why I want to drop this without even finishing it, is because there are so many inconsistencies throughout the movie not to mention all the characters in it did unbelievable, unrealistic stupid act during what we called as emergency situations in which your very own life is on the line. Ex. of this stupidity:<br/><br/>1. The first infected person who was sneaking into the train still got consciousness and only turn into zombie after some time but this rule doesn't apply to the rest of the movie because immediately after that the infection spread at amazing speed. It only needs seconds fort the bitten to turn into zombie.Then right before the end of the movie (I read all the bad review before hand and decided to jump several times to see whether it is worth it or not to spend my 2 hrs for this movie), the infected person once again slowly turn into zombie (esp.when the main character involved, suddenly the infected person still had a little of consciousness for a while until completely turn into the mindless one)
2. Way of fighting. I already watched several types of zombie movies (Dawn of the dead, World War Z, Warm Bodies, Zombieland,28 Days Later, RE, I am Legend > which is my favourite so far)and the way MC fight back (or the rest of the victim ways of responding the outbreak) kinds of silly, lame, uncool, and can't bring the tension.<br/><br/>Without regret, I dropped this one. Not even ""the supposed to be heart warming scene"" where the little girl had to depart from the MC can change my mind to continue it. FYI, I'm a big fans of Korean Drama, Korean movies, and actually watch Gong Yoo drama series, but his act in this movie just so-so especially in the last scene of him (I cringe a lot, C'mon!There are so many better ways to fight the last zombie villain yet you choose to do something that will obviously be your death flag. Seriously. The story writer got mess up in the head and didn't working on the story properly), and I can't bear to watch this anymore.<br/><br/>Save yourself by skipping this one. Feel free to try if you are rather a curious mind like I did (I give it a shot despite many bad review since I believe sometimes review can be pretty much subjective) but beware you have been warned."

","I was reading the reviews before watching and everyone kept saying the cheerleader is hot. So I got to watching and was really disappointed. <br/><br/>Anyway, this is a pretty good movie, and I recommend it if you like zombie movies. The first half hour was good but then it goes down from there. The characters do make a lot of lame decisions and actions. But I think that is more a reflection of how the Asian hivemind is. I live in Japan and I could see a lot of them doing the same thing. No thinking. Just do what the collective does or told to do from someone else.<br/><br/>The zombies are kinda lame and don't follow their established rules. A hit by a baseball bat or a bare fist (LOL) takes them down, but falling from a helicopter doesn't??? For how fast and strong they are I'm surprised thin plastic doors were able to contain them, and then other times not? Why did some people instantly become zombies while other characters had more time? It's like they just did what had the most effect for the movie's plot. Follow the damn rules your story sets!<br/><br/>Finally, be warned the ending is really lame. And by ending I mean last 30 minutes. It just goes full retard, and you never go full retard."

","Honestly, When I first bought this film the only thing I knew about it was that it was a zombie film.<br/><br/>But watching this film without having much prior knowledge about it creates a better viewing experience.<br/><br/>This film is perfectly filmed in regards of setting. Referring to the train. It allows for a realistic sense of claustrophobia making scenes that much more suspenseful. Nowadays it feels like there is no originality within films however this film is different from the rest.<br/><br/>It nails all aspects of what a good film should be. The incredible story allows for a simplistic but powerful ending. The acting should be mentioned as a big plus, with all actors providing an outstanding performance which gives the story a sense of verisimilitude.<br/><br/>This film is a perfect example of what horror should be."
"JessMazo-1","4","4","10","28 September 2018"," Could have been great
","What started as a phenomenal well acted beautifully shot interesting take on a zombie movie starts flatlining at the end with humans doing stupid nonsense<br/><br/>Spoilers:
There are a few scenes where people self sacrifice and I love it. If it's done well and has a purpose. One of the mains gives up his life to hold a door. Cool! makes sense. We all liked that guy now we're sad. 
Then for no reason at all one of the old ladies just hangs out staring at her friend and gets attacked. Umm what?
Want even more dumb? The lady who watches her friend die is like hmmm I wanna die or something. Not really clear but opens up a door to let in a horde of zombies. Why? Who knows. Do you care? Not really. 
A sports guy running with the sports girl go into a train and after spending the whole movie keeping train doors closed behind them, you know: cause zombies, they don't and she gets attacked because jerk guy is alive and screws then over so sports guy could leave since everyone has died and turned and he's like nah let's hug it out. She eats him. 
The rest becomes a tense struggle for survival as the train conductor leaves the train for some reason to help jerk guy. Not sure what his plan was. No weapon and obviously no fighting ability so -dead 
then the ending is so dumb that it boggles my mind someone was like ""green light this baby."" Have the main character fight off jerk guy, who's in the process of changing but wait until he goes full zombie instead of kicking him in the crotch and throwing him off the train. So his solution: oh man you're gonna love this, he comes behind jerk and can grab him anywhere: feet, stomach, arms but no shoves his hand right in his mouth. Because yummy. So he's dead and could have been a reason other than to kill off the cast a few days into shooting for eating into the budget
Then the very end they stop the train in front of creepy tunnel and soldiers on other side about to shoot and stop when they hear the girl singing because why wouldn't you sing in a dark tunnel when you've BEEN CHASED BY ZOMBIES FOR 2 HOURS AND CANT SEE $HHT???"
"manuelasaez","6","4","10","23 January 2017"," Not the best horror film of 2016, but it gets the job done
","This film had me at a crossroads; one the one side, I am a lover of South Korean cinema, and I feel that the country is doing more to advance the art form than any other country. On the other hand, the movie was tame, simplistic, and devolved into a typical Hollywood style blockbuster, with none of the nuance and tact usually found in S.Korean movies. I had heard such great things about this film, and as excited as I was to see it, I just could not shake the feeling that it was limited by either the producer, the country, or the creative team. Where it could have been gruesome and disturbing, it aimed to be tame and heartfelt. I don't care about the human condition when it comes to Zombie films. I care about the Zombie's, who they kill, and how vicious they could get away with showing it.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, and the cinematography was indicative of a very talented creative team. Why this didn't yield a more transcendent and original film, I will never understand. It really did seem like the team wanted to do something grandiose, but kept their reigns pulled back in order to not offend, disturb, or frighten their audience. Basically, a Zombie movie that isn't frightening just isn't worth your time. While Train to Busan was a great film (even by South Korean Standards), it could have been so, so much more. At it stands, it is simply an entertaining film from a talented team of creators and actors, and I suppose that this should be enough for any fan of horror films to give it a watch.<br/><br/>FYI; If you want to see a truly entertaining, graphic and unique Zombie film, I would suggest watching the Japanese movie ""I Am A Hero"". It is objectively the best Zombie film of 2016, and deserve any real horror fans time and attention. It blows this movie so far out of the water, that it is not even a contest."

What seems to be a peaceful ride soon turn into a nightmare as a zombie outbreak manages to make their way inside the train. One by one, passengers fell victim to the pandemic. Can they make it to Busan?<br/><br/>Korean movies always knows best to tug at their audience's heartstrings. Whether it's family drama, life problems, or just full blown tearjerkers. Korean movies is also home to some of the most terrifying, spine-chilling, and effective jumpscare usage in horror movies of all time. This movie captures both aspects successfully. The scoring in this movie is just right, and the visuals provided with each shot is definitely jaw-dropping.<br/><br/>The movie does lack in several aspects, such as inexplicable plot points, questionable decisions by the characters, and some lagging in storytelling by the latter half of the movie. Good thing is, the negative aspects are only apparent on subsequent watches, and the movie still provides good entertainment sprinkled with logical backstories and likable/unpleasant characters for you to root to survive or die.<br/><br/>All in all, Train to Busan is an exhilarating experience, and a fresh take on zombie movie tropes."

It's comparable to Resident Evil series... actually, I think Resident Evil series is much better.<br/><br/>The main character is supposed to be changing from selfish in the beginning to caring for others towards the end. But the main actor played the ""good guy"" from the beginning and the contrast wasn't apparent.

"themadmovieman","8","3","7","7 September 2017"," Not only a brilliant zombie blockbuster, but enthralling and riveting all the way through
","In what is easily the best zombie movie in recent years, Train To Busan proves an enormously entertaining watch at every minute, featuring twists and turns galore to the backdrop of an intensely action-packed battle for survival, yet still with an incredible amount of emotion and heart, thanks to some very well-developed characters and strong performances throughout.<br/><br/>There's a lot to love about this movie, but I'm going to start off with why it makes the zombie genre, one that often falls flat, really work. For me, zombie movies are regularly frustrating watches, proving to be nothing more than two hours of running away from a mass of mildly threatening things, and never really allowing for anything different to spark genuine interest or excitement.<br/><br/>Fortunately, what Train To Busan does is keep the simplest and most effective characteristics of the zombie genre, but make sure that it never loses sight of what makes a good film. As a result, while there's so much fantastic zombie action, and some properly intense violence that makes the undead far more threatening villains than normal, it's the film's story that really makes it work so well.<br/><br/>Above all, the depth of character development is the biggest success of the whole film. Starting off with a concise and interesting introduction to our main characters, looking at a father obsessed with his work and how that has alienated his own daughter, the film doesn't languish about when it comes to being more thorough, but the background that it does give you is absolutely vital for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Following on from the father and daughter, we're introduced just as efficiently to a couple of other major characters on the train that will be integral to the fight for survival, and it's the fact that get a genuine emotional insight into each of them that means you can really fear for them in this situation, and will them to survive against what seem like impossible odds.<br/><br/>Throughout, the film proves itself bold and daring by making sure no major characters are 100% safe, and that means you're sitting on an emotional knife-edge at every moment. It's not the action and pace that makes this film a thrilling watch, but the fact that you're so enthralled in the story, and each and every turn proves yet another incredible twist.<br/><br/>The performances in this film are also just as strong. The excellent character development is matched by a selection of both likable and brilliantly dastardly performances across the board, and although that doesn't always excuse the occasional stupid character decision to advance the plot, it reinforces your emotional connection to the leads, and with the likes of Gong Yoo and Ma Dong-seok in particular putting in fantastic turns, you won't be able to look away from the movie's fantastic heroes.<br/><br/>And finally, I can't forget to say that this movie is a hell of a lot of fun. Its drama may be enthralling, and its emotion powerful, but it's still a playful and hyperbolic zombie movie that will put as much of a smile on your face as put you on the edge of your seat. It's not a downbeat, apocalyptic disaster movie like World War Z or so many Hollywood zombie flicks, but rather a vivacious and rapid-fire blockbuster full of life and humour to go along with its excellent story.<br/><br/>Overall, I was absolutely thrilled by Train To Busan. An incredibly entertaining movie that outdoes almost every zombie movie before it, it impresses with excellent performances and directing, and a story that prioritises enthralling characters and genuine drama over simple thrills and spills, but still leaves time for a load of great zombie action."
"nmn34","8","3","7","14 April 2017"," Hard to Think What to Title This, Its a Zombie Movie
","Zombie movies are very samey,there is no denying this. There is rarely anything that strays from the zombie formula, rarely do you see anything but the immediate start of the outbreak or the recent aftermath. Train to Busan doesn't break from this tradition and doesn't bring anything new to the genre but what it does it does very well.<br/><br/>The setting is perfect for a zombie outbreak, a confined space where there is nowhere to run but still provides better security than being outside. It makes the initial slaughter more plausible, the people that are immediately infected aren't just gawking as the first person is attacked, they're actually trapped and picked off in a domino effect. As they try to flee down the cramped isle, they are picked off by a constantly growing number of zombies until they could reach the relative safety of the next car only for it to fall to a similar fate. Its only when the front of the line manage to put some distance between them that they are able to secure themselves in the first class car. Since the train is almost constantly moving, they are safe from the zombies outside as it searches for safe haven but they can't just get rid of the zombies they have since they control the coupling. And when a small band of survivors are trapped in the rear, the train becomes an convincing gauntlet Te zombies themselves aren't much to look at, they are the usual bullet to the head zombies alas the Of The Dead series and there isn't much to differentiate them from normal people other than glassy eyes and possibly the injury that converted them so cosmetically they aren't the most interesting to look at. The outbreak was too recent to for them to undergo any purification so their makeup is minimal. In motion however they have a lot more going for them. They are quick when motivated and chase their prey with single minded determination but when left alone they meander about like they were in the Thriller video. It is kind of hokey but its seeing them get up more than makes up for it. Rather than just climbing to their feet they contort and twist their bodies until they're on their feat. The process is unnatural and unnerving to watch and is really all there is to set it apart from most zombie movies.<br/><br/>Characters are done well but are pretty much what one would expect from the genre. Just about everyone fits into an archetypal role, the cowardly antagonist, the caring father, the too good daughter, the plucky young man and his girl, and the like. Everyone fits into two terms I could borrow from wrestling, the baby faces and the heels, and they fit them well. The faces are likable, even when they do have their faults they are genuinely good people and learn from them. You route for them and mourn when they fall short. The heels are detestable, they wallow in their inadequacy and are genuinely hate-able people that you feel glad when they receive their comeuppance. It is generally the response you would want from the audience, there aren't mixed messages that the hero is secretly a terrible person. And they drive one of the main themes of the movie home well, the sacrifice of the father for the good of the family.<br/><br/>The downside, it falls for the same trappings as most zombie movies. I mentioned the gauntlet earlier, it is a great idea but with some thought it seems completely unnecessary. The small party were in a safe-ish part of the train, with a little work they should have been able to secure it better and just hunkered down. They could have even contacted the main party and given them updates on their situation, running the gauntlet only puts themselves at greater risk, had they just remained there almost all of the later deaths could have been avoided. But alas, it is a zombie movie and careful strategics has no place when suicidal pro-activity is an option."

The acting was so hilarious and overdone and painfully forced. The behaviour of the 'zombies' was unpredictable because sometimes when the plot wanted it they could walk only slowly, sometimes run away like athletes with ghoulishly done faces, and sometimes just look too lost, it almost felt they were sympathetic of the main characters sad life.

","Yeah so if you watch this movie, I think it's hard to deny how good it is. The action, production, acting combined with both horrifying elements and heartwarming and heartbreaking character moments throughout, it's quite the ride (pun intended).
I really thought I was gonna like this movie a whole lot more up until the ending. Spoilers*! of course.
There were a few pacing issues going back and forth between this big character moment and this big character moment and this big character moment, which honestly made me feel like watching a few insanely good episodes of The Walking Dead back-to-back (not to really compare the two in any other way as they are entirely different). So when it came to the ending, it didn't quite stick the landing for me. At that point, I was very emotionally invested with the characters and it felt kind of like cheating how they killed off the main hero like that and give him his moment and it just...The acting was insane (deserves way more credit than it even gets, especially the little girl), but I honestly had trouble feeling it as much. You just keep seeing this thing throughout the movie and the pay-off for the death is so minimal and such a cowardly low character to bring this faith to the story. (And I do appreciate what they were trying to say but I think the point came across more than once both about status and simply about being humane.) It honestly only upset me that it was what happened, and when we see a very iconic shot of the two remaining survivors at the end walking together, I couldn't help but feel like they definitely earned that moment but so did the dad, and I just didn't feel it as much cus my emotions had just gotten zoomed out. It's like hey, the team behind this movie wanted to do everything to make you cry and even put in shots of the girl as a baby, which could be fine, but it just wasn't quite earned and it pretty much messes up the satisfaction of that ending. Not that we need happy endings or even a bittersweet one but dang... Earn it, don't draw it out and suddenly kill off the hero like 15 other people with these moments because suddenly he can't throw this dumb person off a train in eight attempts despite what we just been seeing for 2 hours, resulting in a cut scene from Grey's Anatomy mixing newborns with melodramatic death scenes.
Unfortunately, that just leaves me having not gained quite the impact I expected from the first and second act and not even half as satisfied as I were with them, bringing me to that I'll still call this a mostly very good movie... overall.<br/><br/>(I certainly hope there is not going to be an American remake of this ever, that'd be too bad. But with its great universal sale, upcoming sequel and high quality production matching some of the best we get from Hollywood, I hope and suspect that it won't be the case. This stands perfectly in its own roots.)"

","After telling my girlfriend that Train to Busan was an amazing movie, I found I couldn't quite tell her why. It doesn't really have any of those moments you talk about after or anything; it's a movie that's simply really engrossing and exciting on a minute-by-minute basis rather than one with amazing set pieces.<br/><br/>It starts slowly, setting up a bunch of characters in a way that reminds me of 70s disaster movies like The Poseidon Adventure. A neglectful father and his young daughter, a couple of middle-aged ladies, a bunch of school kids, all taking a train trip. Then there's a sick passenger who comes back from the dead and suddenly a zombie virus is tearing through the train like wildfire.<br/><br/>Trapped on a moving train, and seeing the outside world is also in the grip of zombies, a shrinking set of passengers fights for survival, beset by zombies as well as the worst of human nature.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully structured. There is a lovely compactness to the way characters are introduced; you quickly have a sense of who they are and become invested. The pace is fast and disasters come on on another like dominoes.<br/><br/>It's not too gory, which is how I like my horror. It's really closer to something like The Birds or Jurassic Park, and is as much action and suspense as horror. You should watch it."

Characters' actions mostly remained convincing: their behaviour is driven by consistent, reasonable motive, and some characters transformed through meaningful incidents naturally, not in a sudden to fit the ending. Each survivor is well acted.<br/><br/>Camera work was effective in portraying a sense of dread and chaos, while keeping focus on the main characters and plots moving along the train corridors. At 2 hours in length, there wasn't much dragging scenes at all. I just skipped the character intro (10 minutes), and from then on, the story runs along. <br/><br/>How realistic is the ending depends on the viewer: are you an optomist or a pessimist? Either way, it's 2 hours well spent.<br/><br/>The 15 minute behind the scenes bonus feature actors and production crew rehearsing, teasing each other, including bloopers, quite a strange shift in mood :)"

 I give this 8 out of 10 easily and I will add it to my collection when it will be released."

","Nominated for 33 awards (winning 9 so far), this is the best zombie film I've seen. The effects are incredible and the acting great, too - especially Su-an Kim (who was also fantastic in Battleship Island). The film is insanely suspenseful at times as we follow a divorced father and his daughter trying to escape the zombie apocalypse. Unlike most zombie films, this film has depth and emotion, and beautiful music, too."

","Train to Busan is an exceptional foreign film. Thrilling from start to finish with a little comedy and heart as well.<br/><br/>I'm not one who looks to watch zombie flicks and this may be the first Korean film I've ever seen and I loved it. The pacing's non-stop and the emotional stuff isn't too much. How many people died because of that Yon-suk a-hole, he's hilarious. It's also about a man's journey in Seok-woo, becoming heroic and selfless, after witnessing those around him and his daughter in particular care for the welfare of others in a time of peril."

","Flipping heck this was an emotional rollercoaster. It's a simple formulaic plot: we follow a family or group of people, a viral outbreak occurs, lots of biting and blood whilst ending with some sacrifices. ""Go! Save yourselves! I'll hold them off""...y'know, that kind of heroism. We've seen it all before. What makes this refreshing and exciting is the actual emotional connection we form with the characters. They aren't all just expendable, they do indeed have some soul. A struggling father to a daughter, a pregnant woman with her devoted partner, a young loved up couple...and a COO of a massive company. Before I begin, I have to let off some steam. The COO was the biggest (try not to swear!)...ummm...coward ever (phew...that'll do). He absolutely boiled my blood. Infuriated the flip out of me. I stood up and simply shouted ""SOMEONE KILL HIM ALREADY!?"". Yet somehow I related to him. In fact I related to most of the characters, they each had individual strands of different personalities that made the plot compelling. It's about self-sacrifice and willing to help others rather than being selfish. Our lead character undergoes this transformation exquisitely, the pressure of survival moulded him into a better human being. It isn't just ""oh my God zombies, let's run this way!!"" (although that is present), there's some heart within the frantic action which I found to be admirable. Extremely well paced for a two hour flick, didn't get bored once. The makeup for the infected looked authentic. Plenty of blood, dark veins and a really nice touch with the grey eyes. I was on the edge of my seat on multiple occasions particularly during the chase scenes. The cinematography was clean and sharp, incredible picture quality. I did find the visual effects to be below average, especially fires or breaking of glass. CGI zombies are kept to a minimal but is unfortunately used. Also punching the infected just relinquishes the fear of them, I was no longer scared of them. However, a damn entertaining train ride."

","The movie itself was pretty good. It felt almost like an old Irwin Allen disaster movie like The Towering Inferno or The Poseidon Adventure, with disparate groups of people being confined to a location or set piece where they have to confront and overcome adversity.<br/><br/>But what stood out most to me was the performance by Kim Su-an who played the little girl Soo-an. In my view, the Korean acting style can at times be a bit theatrical or melodramatic. But not one beat of Kim Su-an's performance felt false. It was dramatic and emotional without crossing the line into melodrama or schmaltz. Very impressive for an actress who must have been around 9-10 years old or so when the movie was produced."
"Katerinapetrova1473","10","2","4","9 May 2017"," One of the best movies I have seen so far
","There are numerous Hollywood movies of zombies and a very successful TV show. Some of them are great with mind-blowing action, CGI, stories and characters. Most of them revolves around a main character who comes in to save the day or teams up with characters who are used to further the story of the MC. To my relief, Train to Busan was nothing like that. This movie is about survival. This movie portrays what people are willing to do to save their loved ones when a crisis breaks out- a very shocking, unexpected and terrifying crisis. How the worst in people and also the best is exposed when people need to survive. It's not the most perfect movie. There are flaws and plot holes but you can easily overlook them with the excellent directing and acting. The director did an excellent job on expressing the intensity and the grim atmosphere for the story to fully grapple us. lastly, Hollywood movies could learn a thing or two on how to represent emotional, human side of the movie in a masterful way."

","It is a very good movie in my opinion, the zombies type. It is different because it approaches the topic in a philosophical way of human behaviors. It has very good emotional moments. The story follows people on a train trying to survive from zombies attack. it represents a sample of society (people in the train) in the train (a place) surviving from zombies (danger, enemies,...). The acting is very good especially the little girl and the big guy. Technically, the movie is very well filmed, good use of top shots and slow motions. The music follows the fast pace of movie, Asian music style. I was hoping to see a zombies movie in other countries style and way, the Korean is by far one of the best."

It ended up being the hands-down best zombie movie I've enjoyed, with constant tension, freshness and a satisfying ending.<br/><br/>Sometimes Korean movies of the last few years have an almost innocence or freshness which has all but disappeared from the US/UK productions, where you become truly engrossed in the story-telling and the simplicity of the screenplay works in favor of the movie. This flick is manipulative in all the right ways. It bring to mind The Thing (1982) in telling a straight-forward story that always keeps you on the edge of your seat and has you genuinely care for its characters. Highly recommended."

","The train to Busan was a movie I desperately wanted to see when I saw the trailer. Imagine being inside a fast train with zombies trying to tear you apart in most of the wagons. <br/><br/>The cast do a great job in this movie. Especially the little girl Suan is acting her heart out and the charismatic Sang-Hwa more than once saves the day. All people you would normally meet on the train are present and once again we discover that the real horror can lie with the people, not with the monsters. Monsters have one thing on their mind: to eat you. People make decisions that effect other people and can spread the hate under the majority just because they only think of their own survival. <br/><br/>It is a lesson in survival, and the big question is how do you want to survive. Being a selfish prick using a human shield or protect others even if it might kill you. <br/><br/>It was very well done, I enjoyed the movie immensely, the pace of the story is good, as is the script, most of the main characters have multiple layers and there is a good amount of drama next to the horror and gushing blood. And the special effects are very well done. <br/><br/>I hear rumors of a US remake. Please don't ruin it."
"Imaculata","8","2","4","25 September 2016"," Zombies on a train
","This Korean zombie film is a real gem. It's a very recent movie, and you can tell they had a good budget for this. What I love about these sorts of movies, is when it's all about the survivors having to be clever to overcome frightening and deadly obstacles.Train to Busan is both original in its concept, and great in its execution. It is a movie that is quite clever in how it uses its core premise; the train. They do so much with the concept, plus they keep it relatively realistic. The movie also delivers some great social criticism. Like is often the case with zombie movies, the real monsters are the people.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect film? No. I thought the ending was a bit anti-climactic. And there was some use of CGI which looked a bit fake. Specifically some plumes of smoke and fires, and those are the sorts of things they could have done practically. At the same time, the movie deserves praise for it's huge establishing shots where various large train stations and towns really look completely abandoned. There's also a couple of set pieces towards the end that are really impressive.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the movie isn't predictable. I had no idea who would live and who would die. And best of all, there were many scenes where I was just grinning and laughing. The movie is fun. The sheer chaos on display in this film is very enjoyable. The movie does not devolve into the grotesque, like so many movies in this genre do. Instead, it focuses on the characters, and on interesting plot developments. And it has so much fun with the genre. It is also a very well paced, and well shot film. It is filmed and paced very much like an American movie.<br/><br/>If all of this sounds like a ton of praise... I guess it is. It's a very enjoyable movie. Go see it."

There are the usual tropes thrown in; the capitalist rich man who stops at nothing to save his life, the innocent and vulnerable child (who likes to stare a lot), the equally vulnerable pregnant wife (I never saw a pregnant woman run so fast in a movie), the dad who tries to save his child and the selfless hero among the top cast.

"garethcrook","7","0","0","14 May 2020"," Zombies on a train.
","Zombie film. Surely there's too many of these. This one though I've heard is rather good. Not snakes on a plane, but zombies on a train. Bear with me... We're in Seoul, Seok-woo and his young daughter Soo-an are heading to see his ex-wife, who lives in Busan. Even as we leave Seoul, something isn't right. A sky-rise on fire, partial reports of a leak at a plant. We know zombies are imminent having seen a deer reanimate in the opening scene... looks really cool actually. The train pulls away, but not before one of these now human zombies that we've half spotted in the periphery gets on board. Seok-woo isn't the most attentive father and falls asleep as their journey begins, leaving his inquisitive daughter to roam the train, just as things are getting weird. Now let's get to the point... are the zombies any good? Well yes, yes they are! They're quick, coming to life in bone cracking yoga poses, all snarly, rapidly covered in convincing looking blood and the camera cuts are choppy at breakneck speeds. Add lots of flesh ripping and screaming and we're on the right track, so to speak. It quickly becomes clear that life outside the train is a bit buggered. Zombies everywhere, standard apocalypse. Thanks to YouTube clips viewed on phones and a government news broadcast on the trains TV, urging people to stay home to remain safe (that sounds familiar), the passengers realise the scale of the situation and panic accordingly. So we've a microcosm of society on board, half the train infected, half okay. Separated by a barricade of luggage, a door and the zombie stupidity at not attacking because they can't see their prey. If that were it I'd say this film was in trouble, but an ill-advised stop does manage to rid the train of a few zombies, provide respite for the now few survivors and add some meat to the back story bone. It's here too that the film takes on a disaster movie tone. There's a plan now. Back on the train, there are people trapped in random cars and toilets, including Soo-an now separated from her frankly quite useless father. It gets a bit more inventive and this is accompanied by some of the characters stories getting fleshed out a little more... but only a little. It does look cool, there's some great sequences and the characters although a bit one dimensional are good enough to carry it. There are clear favourites you want to root for and those you can't wait to be zombie fodder. I think though that I was expecting more and expectations are always dangerous. If you like zombie films, you will love this, but if you're after something a bit meatier, this I think comes up short. Su-an Kim, as the young Soo-an really is the stand out. Some of the other performances are good, but she brings her A-game and really is the glue that holds it together. A good zombie film is always worth a watch and this is, but it's only that, a good zombie film, nothing more... and that zombie deer in the opening scene really does look cool."

","Not since George A Romero's ground-breaking Night of the Living Dead have I been quite so excited by a zombie film, as I have by Korean director Yeon Sang-ho's outstanding Train to Busan written by Park Joo-suk. Just as Romero's iconic black and white feature almost single-handedly dragged horror stories away from the antiquated gothic conventions of yesteryear, Train to Busan is most definitely a zombie film for a 21st century global world, familiar with the challenges associated with all manner of international travails.<br/><br/>The film mostly takes place on a bullet train travelling from Seoul to Busan as a zombie apocalypse suddenly breaks out in the country and threatens the safety of all the confined passengers. These include Seok-woo a cynical workaholic fund manager and divorced father of his daughter Su-an, who wants to spend her birthday with her mother in Busan. Other passengers include Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, Yon-suk a calculating, manipulative chief executive, a high school baseball team including Yong-guk and his cheerleader girlfriend Jin-hee, elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil, and a traumatized homeless stowaway hiding in the bathroom. As the train departs, an ill young woman runs onto the train unnoticed. She turns into a zombie and attacks a train attendant, who also turns. The infection spreads rapidly throughout the confined spaces of the train.<br/><br/>The beauty of this film is that it doesn't just concentrate on the provision of standard visceral generic thrills. It serves as a vehicle to highlight civil unrest resulting in mass hysteria and general panic and indecisiveness; the root of confusing mixed messaging and communications from governing authorities. It can also be seen as a scrutinising microscope, forensically examining the breakdown of nuclear families, socio-economic class distinctions and seeking answers to ethical and moral questions such as which is of greater importance, survival of the individual or the collective?<br/><br/>Fine performances abound from the large cast with particular attention being directed towards Ma Dong-seok as Sang-hwa, a tough, working-class man, who is first to demonstrate to other passengers that it is possible to fight back against insurmountable odds, whilst showing care towards other individuals. Ostensible lead actor Gong Yoo is also very convincing as a self-centred work obsessive, who slowly realises his personal responsibilities to others, as well as his own latent skills and talents that may help him and others survive the onslaughts they must face.<br/><br/>The film created on a budget of just US$8.5 million is a technical marvel, filled with a number of amazing shots, which I for one couldn't help wondering how they had actually been staged and to what extent, if any, was CGI involved. The suspense and thrill factor is only enhanced by a number of twists and turns and breath-taking set pieces which never appear contrived or staged, rather logical outcomes from previous actions.<br/><br/>I can only encourage you to grab a ticket and climb aboard the Train to Busan; not just a clever, fresh take on the zombie genre, but also an extremely well-made film with fully realised characters and plenty of social commentary to underscore the bursts of skilfully staged action."

","I put this off deliberately as i just went on a trip to Korea 3 weeks ago and took the train to Busan from Seoul. I wouldn't have put one foot on a train if i'd watched it first, and would have been on the lookout for zombies the whole time. Kudos to KORAIL for putting their name all over this movie though, my local railway sure wouldn't.<br/><br/>It was interesting, horrifying, corny, brilliant.... everything all squished into one train. I feel for the little girl though, and her father when he finally did what he did at the movie end. Watch this, but not just before you vacation in Korea, seriously."
"ivko","6","0","0","29 January 2019"," snakes on a plane, zombies on the train
","The 'zombie apocalypse' genre has a long history of packing social commentary alongside the scares. I would even go so far as to say the best movies always have a point they are trying to make. But that being said, you need a light touch or it risks becoming a glorified lecture. To paraphrase Futurama, when you do things right, people won't be sure you did anything at all. Unfortunately, with this movie even the dimmest audience member will know exactly what the movie is doing by the five minute mark because its messaging has all the subtlety of one of its Zeds.<br/><br/>But I'm getting ahead of myself. The movie, set in South Korea (dialogue is also Korean so native English speakers like myself will need subtitles), follows the passengers of a train headed to Busan which starts off just as the news starts getting a little weird. This part of the movie is done quite well, with the characters observing emergency vehicles speeding towards distant fires, odd crowds at the train station, and the occasional person running past in a panic without any obvious source for their distress. Things escalate quickly, however, and soon the characters are in the classic survival scenario.<br/><br/>The movie follows the perspective of several characters, but the ""main"" character is a young overworked father taking his daughter to see his estranged wife. Exposition scenes inform us that despite the wealth and stature he's achieved as a hedge fund manager, his familial relationships are strained due to his heavy workload. His daughter in particular wastes no opportunity to reject him or badmouth him to strangers for his ""selfishness"".<br/><br/>In broad strokes this theme of ""selfishness is bad"" isn't completely foreign to American cinema. In a western film the guy who refuses to stick his neck out for fellow survivors or hordes resources would probably be expected by the audience to face some comeuppance, but the version here is pretty strict. Just having the job of hedge manager earns the scorn of other characters because it made him wealthy, and his own daughter rejects him openly after he attempts to use his influence to keep her safe without also trying to help everyone else. Even his investment strategy earns him a call accusing him of responsibility for the actions of a company in his portfolio.<br/><br/>The movie keeps hammering on this point the whole way through. For example, there's also a scene that takes place after the main character has 'learned his lesson' that showcases a whole group of 'selfish' people which ends very predictably. My problem is that after a while it begins to feel contrived, like they are forcing characters to act in ways that aren't logical or reasonable just so they can line up another parable for the audience.<br/><br/>Fortunately, a lot of the other aspects of the movie are well done and make up for the weaker elements. The movie is deeply atmospheric and beautifully shot, really conveying the unsettling feeling of a society in full breakdown. Simple things like the conductor communicating with traffic controllers effectively spread unease as the conversations gradually reveal the isolation of the train and its passengers in a world going dark. Dialogue is minimalist but efficient, portraying fear and grief but sprinkling in enough humor to keep it from becoming overbearing. And the main danger, the zombies, are well designed and executed, being scary enough to keep you on edge and utilized for more than simple jump scares.<br/><br/>The ending kind of made me sigh, and the little girl wasn't so much cute as grating, but the ending was earned by the story. I would say that as far as these types of movies go, it was fairly original and interesting. Expect to feel a little lectured at but mostly still have a good time."

If you're wanting to go see a happy go lucky or romantic movie, this is NOT it. However, if you're looking for an action thriller that won't stop til the end, this is it. The funny thing is that this movie also has a incredibly sentimental, heart-breaking scene. Suffice it to say that one of the messages of the movie is to spend more time with your kids.

"Tweetienator","6","5","17","12 September 2016"," Good but no Masterpiece
","Lots of praise by other reviewers so I will play the advocatus diaboli here - Train to Busang is a good flick with fast running zombies/infected like portrait in 28 Days later etc. A couple of ppl are in a train as the outbreak hits the nation (South Korea). The fight of these survivors on the train and on some stations is the main plot, centered around a father and his little daughter and a man and his pregnant wife as the main heroes. I liked the movie - camera, acting everything is pro but the movie lost for me a lot cuz some figthing scenes were just not well executed - for example three guys fighting with baseball bats and fists their way through train wagons filled with dozens of infected. No bite, no blow, no wound, it's just simply impossible, it looks like a little bit of a Chackie Chan movie here - trained forces with guns etc. turned cuz they their overruned by the infected but our heroes just get them down with one fist-punch... If u ever had to fight with a mad guy you know what a strength such a man can execute even if you are of more strength and weight. Also the gore level is for my taste rather low - lots of blood yes, but no limbs or guts etc. flying around or flesh bitten out by hungry maniacs etc. So yes, this movie is far far better as all those wanna-be zombie flicks from pseudo-filmmakers with no talent and/or budget but can't beat the elite movies of this genre: a good movie but not in all aspects (some terrible hollow Asian drama scenes) really convincing and in no way the ""best zombie movie ever"" like some other reviewers stated."

","If you want to know what Train to Busan is like then think World War Z (2013) without the need to pay homage to Brad Pitt the scientist action hero. Busan is much more a touching tale of an ordinary man and his cute as pie daughter caught up in world slamming events. Those events broil away just as the train is leaving and then spill like angry snakes and writhing intestines at every survivable turn right through to the hold on to your seat ending. Amazing cinematography combined with amazing scenes of thrashing humanity. This one is worth every penny."

"JakeBrinkman","10","2","5","24 October 2019"," My new favorite zombie movie
","Train to Busan was a non-stop trip through a phenomenal zombie film. The zombies were truly frightening, and I felt they behaved very realistically in their mad dashes to their targets. It was reminiscent of World War Z, while also giving more consideration to the limits of the human body. This is the first time I've seen a movie where the dead eyes somewhat affected their vision, and I absolutely love that addition.<br/><br/>The acting from even the child and the minor supporting roles was absolutely top notch. Even the smallest supporting roles were given so much depth that I was convinced the characters were real people. My only dislikes about the movie were how some characters behaved, but it's also very easy to see how some people really would behave that way in that situation, so I don't fault the movie for including them. It was very obvious the actors really connected with their characters' emotions, and it really paid off to create an epic film that was easy to connect to.<br/><br/>Most zombie films show a world where no one has ever heard of a zombie, but Train to Busan was more realistic for the current world. It was fun to see a group that knew the basics of handling themselves, and I loved that, even with this knowledge, they still struggled thanks to some characters' dumb decisions and the total chaos that is expected in that situation. It was an all around fantastic movie that I highly recommend."

","Train to Busan is proof that with effective visual storytelling, you don't need exposition. I watched this movie in Japanese with Japanese subtitles, and despite my Japanese being just ""Ok"" I was able to understand everything the movie was trying to convey. Sometimes simple is best.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a protagonist who comes across as selfish and unlikeable, but slowly becomes the hero as the story progresses. However Train to Busan manages to do this without shoving it down the viewer's throat. None of the characters seem like important people with special knowledge, they're all just normal people in a bad situation trying to survive.<br/><br/>The choice to confine the story on a train, for the most part, helps the viewer feel a sense of claustrophobia throughout the film and it makes every action the characters make a little more nail biting.<br/><br/>While Train to Busan may not be the most original idea, it proves not everything has to be. When done well, even the oldest stories can still make a viewer feel fear, tension, and apprehension for 2 hours."

","The highest grossing film in South Korea of all time is a routine, but well made zombie thriller. The story begins at the outset of a zombie outbreak with a father and daughter finding themselves on a train to the town of Busan, hoping to escape the zombie plague around them. Unfortunately, the train has a number of folks who are slowly turning intro zombies, so the survivors aboard the train find themselves having to fight their way through the infected cars to get to the safe ones. This story may sound similar to ""Snowpiercer,"" but ""Train to Busan"" lacks that film's smart political subtext. ""Train to Busan"" is simply trying to entertain and it does quiet successfully achieve that with tons of fast zombie action, some interesting set pieces, and solid special effects, which is all fine and good if you're into zombie movies. On the downside, I'm not a fan of fast zombies and prefer the slow lumbering Romero-zombies, just as I also prefer my zombie films to have a Romero-style political subtext. So overall, ""Train to Busan"" manages to come up with some interesting situations and set pieces and does them well, it's all pretty vapid and you'll forget most of the film an hour after you've watched it."

","Train To Busan, it's a south korean horror film, directed by Yeon Sang-ho. it lasted 118min ( it's one of the best 118min in my life Xd ). This movie is set in South Korea!
It started with Seok-Woo ( Gong Yoo ) who accepted his doughter's request, which is to take her to Busan to see her mother, because it's Su-An's birthday ( Well.. Su-An is the daughter:) ).. But the journey has been disrupted by a hellish on-board zombie outbreak.. And the real story begins... Who will survive? and How?
I think that it is more than a horror movie, because it shows how selfish, greedy a human can be... And It makes you realize how precious your father is. He is the one who will make many sacrifices for you when no-one will.. 
The ending was especially well-done and sentimental. A child who saved lives through her singing.. Which make me realize that music makes us feel secure..
Overall, ' Train To Busan ' is the best Zombie movie ( It's exciting, emotional and heartbreaking ) with a good child actor! Also the performances are convincing...
If you are a Zombie fan, you should definitly give this movie a try ;)."

","This is without a doubt the best zombie movie we have ever seen! I would say that it is better than Dawn of the Dead. The movie has non-stop thrills, nonstop kills, nonstop action and nonstop emotion. We get to know each character one by one and bit by bit but the main focus here was Seok-woo (Yoo Gong) and his daughter Soo-Ann (Su-An Kim). Their journey to survive the zombie apocalypse made you want them both to live. Along the way we meet many other interesting characters and a very horrifying villain by the name of Yon-suk (Eui-sung Kim). He is by far the most nastiest, greediest and most coldest person you will probably ever meet. He kills so many people along the way in order to save himself from the zombies. The movie is just beyond incredible and it's way better than any is zombie Hollywood movie That we've ever seen! The makeup and effects are just incredible and so passes and he zombie movie with seen since Dawn of the Dead. Only problem English people may have with it is that it is in North Korean subtitles but that didn't bother us one bit as we don't mind reading subtitles. Highly recommended to every zombie fan all over the world and if you want to see excellent character development along with people and characters who you actually care about we highly recommend this film! 5/5 stars"

","Though of course, people would not agree with my assessment, I believe that train to Busan is a well adjusted film with elements of suspense, longing, tension, tragedy, sacrifice and terror thrown into the mix. It is a well rounded movie and the acting performances are above par. This I say when comparing it to movies belonging to the same genre. There is nothing here that hasn't been done before but the way it has been shot is commendable. The ride starts early and the tension does not let up for a single moment. Especially heart rending is the scene towards the end where the father sacrifices himself to save his daughter. It is the sort of movie that stays with you long after the credits role because you start to think - what would you do when you face such insurmountable odds. Again, not something that is unique to this movie but the way it has been done is unique and appealing. Altogether an excellent movie. Now let's wait for Hollywood to butcher it with a remake."

Korean movie industry, however, if this is any indication of future offerings I will be watching a lot of Korean flicks. I don't like watching movies by subtitles but in this movie it didn't hinder the quality or the suspension of reality at all! --- As I said before, this movie is in the vein of 28 Days Later, which was, in my opinion, the first and best modern age zombie flick since the original ""Night Of The Living Dead"" way back in 1968. I give props to NOTLD because it was the first, but I never liked the premise of those movies, in that they try to tell the watcher that something can actually bring you back from actual death. I am sorry but to my sciences oriented mind that just does not work. However, a plague that turns humans into homicidal psychopathic lunatics is believable in my mind. In fact there are actual examples of such things in nature right now. There are fungi that literally attack an insect's brain and turn insects into zombies that do their bidding in infecting others and moving to the best place for the fungus to send out its spores and such. So 28 Days Later really worked for me and so does ""Train to Busan""! And the acting in the movie was great too, especially from the little girl. I have to admit at first I thought this was another Japanese SciFi flick, but after 5 minutes into the movie it hit me that this wasn't Japanese. If this is an example of the S.Korean film industry to come Japan had better get better and fast or just step aside because S. Korea is in the house."

"lmna990","8","2","5","14 September 2016"," Excellent thriller, zombie movie of the year
","Amazing cast, great cinematography and edge-of-your-seat suspense. Stars very normal and gradually increases in terror. The directing is so well done that you feel every emotion there is to feel. The zombies behavior is very believable, as how they are fast and fearless and unmerciful. Of course the train aspect if it is very terrifying. However, very realistic in terms of people reacting the way they did and dying the way they did. The ending is very simple yet perfect for the thriller that happened previously.<br/><br/>The plot of how exactly its started is still vague. I really hope they make a prequel, where they show people stuck in the beginning of the riot. Showcasing the madness of how it first spread between people and the police. As a group tries to escape, they die one by one until the girl that gets bitten rides the train to Busan.<br/><br/>Amazing job and good work to all those participated 👏🏻"
"pal05052003","8","2","5","4 September 2016"," A group of people has to survive a train full of zombies.
","Koreans are good at making horror, and this zombie movie attempt shows how skillful they are. You have fast-running zombies, blood spattering, and selfish people. The film delivers shock value, and decent drama along the way. It feels like World War Z without CGI zombies piling on each other. Being set on a train, the plot is also similar to Snowpiercer, another train horror movie. (what is this obsession with trains, or is it the only place in Korea where the space is cramped?)The acting is decent, and the casts are pretty average-looking; with the exception of the lead actor, which makes the story more credible. The director did not focus too much on morality issues like the Walking Dead, but sets up new problems for the characters to face at different stages of the movie. This makes the plot move quickly and smoothly. The ending was rather conventional, but I guess no one hates a happy ending."

They should have just ended it with more of the group surviving. So, if you don't mind stupid endings then you will like this. But if it pisses you off when they kill people off for no reason other than some schmo decided it would be cool then pass.

","Some characters die from order of appearance, which is quite predictable. It had a few cheap tear jerkers, like the vulnerable pregnant woman and child losing their loved ones to zombies, Very clichè. The movie tried to send a moral message across to its audience with the main protagonist shown to be a selfish prick at first, but as the film progresses he learns throughout his horrific train ride that he needs to be a caring father. A strange message for a zombie movie I thought. Of course the zombies aren't the only bad guys, as some of the living can be dicks too and they're the ones who get everyone killed whilst getting killed themselves. The last scene was kind of like watching night of the living dead. Overall formulaic and predictable, but fun watch.

","In this fine Korean entry in the 'fast-moving zombie' sub-genre, a diverse group of survivors find themselves sharing the linear confines of a high-speed train with ravenous undead, hoping to eventually reach safe haven. I watched an English subtitled version, but thought that the cast was very good, especially 10-year old Kim Su-an as Su-an and Gong Yoo as Seok-woo, her fund-manager father who is forced to re-examine his values in light of the grisly apocalypse. The film is somewhat uneven in the capacities of the hyper-animated corpses to absorb punishment but otherwise the story holds together pretty well (considering the premise is a communicable agent that near instantaneously turns a bitten person into a milky-eyed, frenetic cannibal). Well-made and smoothly directed, 'Train to Busan' is an entertaining entry into a generally bloated genre and impressively for a zomboid film, pulls off affecting, almost moving, ending."

"joebloggscity","8","2","6","21 October 2018"," Next Stop: Korean Zombies - Worth getting on for
","I've had a big thing for Korean horror films from the 2000s in particular, but of late have lost touch. I was recommended this movie to sit down and watch, and what a pleasant surprise it turned out to be.<br/><br/>Zombie films have been done to the death (no pun intended) over the past decade or two, and there have been some very interesting and enjoyable movies over a number of genres. However, this one sidesteps the problems some others have by having a good director, budget and good cast of actors with a fine script. Avoiding the slapstick, comedy or torture porn route, this is a story about redemption for a father out to protect his daughter and discover the human within. Okay, that's not exactly wholly original (e.g. War of the Worlds etc) but it does have heart and keeps you engrossed.<br/><br/>As per the name of the film, the travellers are stuck on a train to Busan from Seoul along with the zombies, and we have action without too much gore/violence, but really tension and emotion as we watch our protagonists try to survive this catastrophe. There are some cliched characters, for example the older selfish rich businessman and the old couple etc, but really you can't change everything. It still works.<br/><br/>Granted this doesn't have any social commentary like some that made the zombie genre famous, e.g. the Night of the Living Dead, but in its own way it is a refreshing change on the low budget or comedy-centric comedies that have abounded of late in the field. I really enjoyed it. Bit concerned if they make a sequel, but that will be inevitable. Worth a try."

It is 2 hours of touching moments or upsetting behaviour. The film shows the best and worst of people, which is often true in crisis.<br/><br/>The movie is unfortunately hindered by a few cliches towards the end, perhaps because it was made to be a success at the Box office. Only small directing choices that I feel would be better removed. Character behaving same way three times in around five minutes. A Flashback and what I assume was meant as a 3D moment.<br/><br/>So if, you have been putting off watching this, in fear of just another Zombie movie. Or you love Zombie movies.

","This is one spectacular zombie movie. The acting of all the actors are superb. No cheap jump scares, only genuine and sheer thrills and tensions from most part of the movie. The antagonist in this movie got what he deserved, which was very satisfying to our part as audiences. I was not sure about the little girl's acting skill, because she was like a robot at first half of the movie. But everything was revealed at the end of the movie. And it was really great. It was really heartbreaking when the main actor got bitten at the end. My only regret is that why didn't he use his shoe to gag the old man's mouth, so that he won't be able to bite? Were he to do that, he would still be alive with his daughter and the pregnant lady. Not turned into one of them and threw himself off the train. I cried like a baby when the little girl was crying, refusing to let go of her Dad. It was so sad. Why did they make the main character dead? I think that sucks BIG TIME! And that's the only reason why I didn't give this movie a 10 out of 10."
"gulfaran786","9","2","6","8 January 2017"," Very little to complain about

Character development is right on the money even for those who only get a short amount of time or lines on screen. I have a few bones to pick with the way things were carried out on 2 occasions in the movie but to an extent it is part of what makes it great because I'm left thinking backwards about how things could have gone differently only if this happened. Then I think further back and say the same thing. It's a must watch. You will be invested in the characters completely."

Nothing much surprises me these days as I've seen it all before but still usually enjoy them. So I saw this was highly rated and gave it a go. I was locked in from the start. The characters were very engaging and they hook you in their journey. What really stood out for me was the fact this zombie film made me emotional. Horror films don't make me emotional but this made me cry. I am truly amazed as I never expected a Korean film to be such quality. The acting, scenery and special effects were on par of a A grade Hollywood film. The scenes throughout were totally heartbreaking specially at the end. Thank you for not killing them right at the end. My only criticism would be that the three of them should have made it till the end, I am a sucker for happy endings. I loved the character of the pregnant lady's husband, he was awesome and I was gutted he didn't make it. Most Hollywood dramas take seasons to character develop but this film managed it right from the start. Highly recommend it."
"beanbiin","7","2","6","30 October 2016"," Train to Busan resembles with Snowpiercer in which both film main setting was on the train but twisted with Zombie Apocalyptic Plot.
","Before Train to Busan became popular when it reaches big screen across the globe, I thought It will have a resemblance with Snowpiercer a film which was also directed by a Korean director, Bong Jon Hoo. What's differ with this Train to Busan film is, it is purely Korean made from director to language and it became popular over the social media because of the uniqueness of the Title.<br/><br/>Train to Busan resembles with Snowpiercer in which both film main setting was on the train but twisted with Zombie Apocalyptic Plot. However, just like previous zombie horror sci-fi film, there's nothing special with the zombies in Train to Busan from how it was spread and how zombies reacts with uninfected ones. I loved how the train gives major role in the film however, despite they are inside the train, the story is something that so usual among zombie horror film. One bad point is, they are always in a group; a group with different personality and objectives which for me is platitude to give a thrilling rising in action. Story is not that unique, cliché, plot holes and impossible scenes are present in the whole duration of the film. It's the same as usual zombie apocalypse with no major changes of plot. <br/><br/>Train to Busan is definitely a simple Zombie Horror Film that do not gives adrenaline satisfaction of it's common and bad story line. But still a must watch movie for Zombie Lovers."
"oldvinyl","10","2","6","24 October 2016"," Scream, shout, and jump about.
","I had to watch this movie in two parts because after seeing half of it, I was all screamed out. I'm not a great fan of zombie movies, I don't watch Walking Dead, but this film impressed me enormously because the zombies are, first, only incidental to the plot; and secondly, they have allowed the director to incorporate some truly wonderful and bizarre concepts. The film starts in a subtle sort of way. Watch carefully or you'll miss things. It's nice to see how the director uses these half- glimpsed horrors to show the dawning comprehension of the passengers on the train, that something seems to be going wrong with the world. The director Sang-ho Yeon, who also wrote the screenplay, is adept at stretching out the agony to improbable levels as time after time the zombies almost get to chow down on the passengers. But as I said earlier, this is a long film, and there's only a certain amount of time before chowing down does indeed occur, and a whole lot more, besides. The high point of the film, for me, comes when the train nearly crashes headlong into a disaster scene at an intermediate station. Somehow the passengers and driver must find another train to continue their journey to Busan, and - they hope - safety. And now begin screaming again. I'm giving this film 10 points because of so many things, but mainly the sheer inventiveness of Sang-ho Yeon."
"Watchwaytoomuch","Null","2","6","17 October 2016"," Tense ride that's well executed and even manages genuine emotion.
","This is one of the best zombie/virus outbreak movies ever made. The tension is palpable and builds throughout. By the end I was feeling like I had been running/panicking along with the characters.<br/><br/>During the whole movie there was a perfect balance between the terror and panic, and the fear and distress and emotion that would come with such occurrences. At many points the execution of the zombies and how they move, react, attack was superbly directed and felt far more professional and well thought out that many U.S. movies that churn out the crap rubbish. Often in these kind of movies something happens which breaks you out of your watching because you think 'that wouldn't happen' or 'that's not realistic'. I don't think I thought that once during the whole movie.<br/><br/>By the end I had a tear in my eye (as did the person I saw it with) - I won't say anymore other than the writer, director, crew, actors, all deserve a round of applause for a fantastic effort.<br/><br/>I would suggest that zombie and horror movie lovers in the West DON'T WATCH THE U.S. TRAILER as it reveals too much - it won't ruin the film, but some of the scenes are really great and would be better as a surprise."

","I was lucky to see this Korean zombie flick before it is shown in our regions on Halloween night. It's already out for months. And I must say that I really enjoyed this must see flick.<br/><br/>Even as it clocks in at almost 2 hours it never had a boring moment. And it do has a few sentimental moments about losing the one you love. And even as the story isn't that strong it all works out fine. It's just a survival on the train that has some zombies running around.<br/><br/>But what makes this flick watchable and above mediocre are the effects used. The zombies do react and move on a weird way, And in the beginning the deer standing up after being hit, wonderful. Also there's a lot of CGI used with collisions between trains but it all looks real. Even the horde smashing against each other it do works. <br/><br/>For all zombie geeks a must see. <br/><br/>Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5"
"thesar-2","8","2","6","2 October 2016"," Only Z this World War
","While these aren't the zombies I'm looking for, the movie made up for every wrong-doing in World War Z.<br/><br/>Train to Busan is an incredibly well-shot, well-acted and well-thought- out zombie/infected film with characters you care about, want to see grow and live. It might have had a low budget, but you'd never know it; this foreign film looked like a major Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>Now, though the many scenes of heart, exposition, depth, setup and introduction to our ""heroes"" worked really well, the movie was terribly too long. I wasn't really complaining throughout for pacing or length, nor was I wondering if scenes could be cut, but it still went on far longer than it should have. It was almost as if there were 5-6 climaxes and then you realize you still have 45-25 minutes left.<br/><br/>Also, and this is a personal preference, the zombies ran at Mach One speed. Sincerely, I love zombie shows and I'm a purist at heart. The slow, stumbling, ""yes, you can walk right past them"" kinds are what frighten me the most. The exception to the rule was 2004's Dawn of the Dead remake. They were fast, fine, but the movie's all-around greatness made me forget my hang-up on the bionic-beasts.<br/><br/>And Train to Busan did the same thing. There was so much good here, the zombies were pretty much incidental to everything else I liked. <br/><br/>Basically a divorced and selfish dad agrees to take his daughter to see her mom on a train when the 77,493th zombie-apocalypse begins. (That's not a complaint to how many there are, just a semi-fact. Still love this subgenre!) Unfortunately for the passengers, an infected, bitten, Walker, The Living Dead or Zombie – pick your poison, gets on board and all hell breaks loose. <br/><br/>Unlike most of the Z movies, you will see characters grow and scenes so powerful, it'd be hard not to choke up. I certainly did. And though the film's not without the standard clichés and stereotypical evil/not-evil scared humans, it's easy to also get past those movie tropes since the actors are so strong and believable.<br/><br/>I really, really did like this movie. If you're a fan of zombie flicks and require a lot more depth and sometimes humor, you cannot go wrong here.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Day 2 Movie in the Can! I'm watching a NEW-2-ME horror movie every day of October 2016 and this one I've heard good things about. I actually put it off too long just to save for October. Wish I hadn't; not only was the movie great, it had some incredibly cute Asian men that I wouldn't mind finding more films with them in it."

","""Train to Busan"" is a 2016 Korean drama/zombie film directed by Yeon Sang-ho. It follows a man named Gong Yoo, his estranged daughter Soo-Ann and other passengers become trapped on a speeding train during a zombie outbreak in South Korea.<br/><br/>I was recommended to watch this film by a close friend of mine, he knows I love horror/drama films and the fact that it's a Korean based film is even more up my alley. Then I found out this was on Netflix, so I finally got to watch it! I can honestly say this is the strongest zombie film I've ever seen, I know that's a huge statement to make since some U.S. based zombie films are well regarded. However I have my reasons, which I will get into.<br/><br/>First of all whatever cameras they used to film this movie I would kill to play around with! This movie was beautiful and so crystal clear in picture. There are fantastic shots done in this film and I really appreciate it for that. Also the special effects themselves were top of the line, that deer at the beginning looked fantastic. Seeing hoards of zombies running and falling over each other like a tidal wave was horrifying, there is so much great tension in this film. Also, the actors they got to play the zombies were fantastic in the way they moved and contorted. The movie also didn't need to use disgusting visuals to get it's point across, which zombie films/series do quite often.<br/><br/>Every character had personality. I don't personally know any of the actors in this film, but they made a lasting impact on me! Everyone was great, but the 2 that stood out the most to me were the dad (Seok-woo) played by Yoo Gong and Yong-guk played by Woo-sik Choi. Both played emotion with such expression and guttural tones that I felt their performances were the most noteworthy. Also... Woo-sik Choi is very cute, so I'll be checking him out in ""Parasite"" as well.<br/><br/>When character die throughout this movie, you feel the loss. Which is the greatest compliment you can give a film like this. The action and drama flowed very well together, even when the scenes were slower paced I was still invested. Definitely check this one out and give foreign films a chance! Don't use reading subtitles as an excuse to skip fantastic movies like this one, it just makes you look lazy!"

As a fan of not only horror movies but also of zombies in particular, this film manages to show the true terror of a zombie apocalypse, using the setting of the tight corridors of the train to its full advantage.<br/><br/>George Romero may have created the zombie genre, but this film truly uses all the techniques at hand to craft a terrifying experience... one that I will not forget for a while.<br/><br/>If you have a Netflix account, you would be wasting it by not checking this film out.

"Tweekums","9","1","2","7 August 2019"," Train to Busan
","Seok-woo is a workaholic fund manager living in Seoul with his mother and Su-an, his young daughter. She is desperate to see her mother, who lives four hundred and fifty kilometres away in Busan. Eventually her father agrees to take her and together they board the train to Busan. As the train prepares to depart we are introduced to a few other characters; a man and his pregnant wife; a pair of older women; a school girl and her boyfriend a wealthy business executive; a homeless man who keeps saying 'everybody is dead!' and a girl who is behaving strangely. Soon after the train sets off this girl attacks a train attendant... it is clear that she was infected with something that causes extreme violence. It isn't long before more and more become infected and survivors are barricading themselves in the remaining safe parts of the train. If that weren't enough it is clear that the infection is affecting people throughout South Korea.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this South Korean zombie film; it provided tension from soon after the start right to the final scene. The zombies are more like those infected in '28 Days Later' than classic slow shuffling ones some people might not be keen on that but I think so long as they are scary all is good... and these provided the scares. The film nicely establishes rules that these particular zombies follow. Inevitably there are plenty of gory scenes, but nothing too excessive, and it isn't entirely obvious who, if anybody, will survive. The key characters are introduced well and fairly quickly; they include a good cross section of society and both heroes and cowards. Setting the film in the confined space of a speeding train adds an extra danger as there are limited places for survivors to hide safely for any length of time. The cast is solid and make us believe in their characters; similarly the special effects are pretty impressive. Overall I'd say that this is definitely a film to watch if you like zombie movies.<br/><br/>These comments are based on watching the film in Korean with English subtitles."
"hongdrix","7","1","2","30 June 2019"," Tear jerking scene odd.
","Overall a good zombie movie. I hate when zombies run, but it makes the movie more suspenseful. However Korean movies have these formulaic scenes where they try to squeeze tear drops out of the movie goers' eyes, scenes daring the audience to not shed tears. Very offputting IMO."
"silvermistvio","10","1","2","18 May 2019"," Great zombie film even though it's Korea's the first zombie film ever.
","Train to Busan is Korea's the first zombie film and also one of the best zombie films of all time. I rarely watch Korean films, but when I saw this film, I was totally surprised because it's the first.<br/><br/>As the film name, Train to Busan, the whole thing happened on the train. So, the filming location scope is small but it turned out great. What I like of this film is it shows if you don't want to die, you'll die quicker than usual. So, we don't need to afraid of dying. We all have to die one day anyway. No one can avoid it.<br/><br/>I really hate that CEO guy. The way he try to survive by pushing all people around him to die is something I hate most. And also I hate Koreans always love to kill off the main character(s), making the film unhappy ending. If they make the film end with some kind of happy ending, it'd be better than this.<br/><br/>The makeup skills, special effects used in this film and performances of actors and actresses are good, so that the film becomes better and better. Even though this film is the first zombie film that Koreans ever made, it's like they had a lot of experiences with zombie films. They could make a great one on the first go.<br/><br/>Although there are some things that I don't like in this film, it still makes one of the best zombie films I've ever watched. It's enjoyable, so, I recommend you all to watch it."
"CoderHead","7","1","2","30 April 2019"," Korean Zombies Done Right
","I've seen this film mentioned elsewhere and saw it come up in my Netflix recommendations a few times so I thought I'd give it a try - especially since the user rating is impressive for Netflix and it was nominated for and won some awards.<br/><br/>In essence, it's a fairly typical zombie horror flick but the emphasis is a complex family dynamic and mental struggle of survivors on the train from Seoul to Busan. Nobody suddenly becomes a ninja warrior or a military arms expert and not everyone lives to the end of the movie. I think that differentiates it from standard Hollywood zombie fare and makes it more compelling in the end.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty solid and the special effects are (even though sometimes comical) surprisingly high-quality. Even though zombies are kind of played out at this point I'd recommend giving this one a lazy, rainy day viewing."

","About 2.5 years after the release, I watched this movie.

The CGI aren't half bad. The suspense and thrill also keep you on the edge. BUT and this is a really big but, how the characters take decision here is what infuriated me the most. They are - to put it nicely - UTTERLY STUPID.<br/><br/>The story started nice and sound. All good until zombie arrived and suddenly all characters decided to be the stupidest person in the world. Yes, I know zombie and any other life-threathening situation will clouding your judgment. But in this movie, it's just unbelievable idiot. I lose interest through the end of the movie but keep watching (though with high blood pressure).<br/><br/>Yes, yes there are touching dramas here and there but the drama doesn't need to occurred IF the stupid decision was not taken at the very first place.

","Loved it. I saw a YouTube video about hidden gems on Netflix and they recommended this. I am pretty sick of zombie movies (actually I'm very sick of them) but we were bored, nothing else was on and we decided to watch this. <br/><br/>The pace is perfect, the acting was so very natural and the horror seems genuine. Actress Su-an Kim was amazing as the young girl traveling with her father. There are several strong performances in this and it makes all the difference. There are no dull moments as it the story moves from interesting to threatening to full out nightmare.<br/><br/>You really get pulled into the situation with these people because as I said, the acting is so natural that you feel you've gotten to know a little bit about these people in the short amount of time they are on the screen. My wife never watches horror / zombie movies but this hooked her immediately. There's just something about it that's a cut above most. <br/><br/>Not sure if the other reviews contain spoilers or not but I was glad that I knew nothing about the plot other than it involves people , zombie types and a train. <br/><br/>Watch it , I can't imagine a horror fan not thoroughly enjoying this .

"sjalkarjadottir","8","1","2","29 January 2018"," A throwback to simpler times
","This horror/action movie follows a rather typical setting. Confined space and a very personal, limited cast of protagonists. Those are stereotypical .. but not dull. There is character developement .. believable .. as well as sacrifice and heroism. <br/><br/>All is done in a very ""natural"" .. not forced way. There are manierisms that feel a bit foreign to western culture, i guess .. but nothing that is in the way of understanding the plot. I would guess that an asian viewer might pick up on things a western viewer might not .. but those would only be subtle. <br/><br/>Action is well done with a few CGI effects (regarding the horde) that do look rather odd. Most effects seem to be practical though and the acting is mostly well done (despite the occasional overacting and the obviously overacted ""bad guy"")<br/><br/>Since it is a very classic zombie story, there are the typical weaknesses of course .. but all in all .. the movie is engaging and very enjoyable to watch .. although not a suspeseful as other horror movies (it was more an action flick in my opinion that just happened to have zombies in it)"
"dollypeppers","9","1","2","9 January 2018"," A Powerful Story About Humanity with All Its Good and Bad
","Wow. I'm still crying. This movie was beautiful. I don't mean that aesthetically because as a zombie movie, with all the gore that comes with the genre, it's not pretty to look at. The zombies are all very gross, satisfyingly so to a zombie aficionado but undoubtedly a bit much for the average person. The zombie deer in particular is NASTY the way it twists itself back onto its feet after being hit by the car. But the zombies aren't the point of the movie and aren't why the film is beautiful so I'll move on.<br/><br/>This film explores both innate human selfishness and innate human selflessness in both aspects. Our main character is a father who spends too much time working and not enough time with his (ADORABLE!!!) daughter. He's made himself such a stranger to his child that he buys her a Wii which she already has, and from what I was given to understand he purchased for her a previous holiday(though that may be wrong as I don't speak Korean and the subtitles went by fast). At one point Dear Old Dad flat out tells his kid to only look out for herself, not to do anything as simply kind as to give her seat up to an elderly woman. So Dad starts off in a very selfish place and then there's the other guy, whose name I didn't care to catch, some suited jerk that LEAVES PEOPLE TO THE ZOMBIES REPEATEDLY. Wow, why is it always like that in zombie movies? If the zombie apocalypse does happen, I'm going to be sorely tempted to kick any dude in a suit out of my space before he screws me over. Anyway the selfishness of humanity is on full display when Suit Jerk convinces a car full of people not to help the elderly woman, a pregnant woman and her husband, Dad and his daughter, and some poor kid. He actually gets them kicked out of the car for no reason than his own selfishness and fear. Suit Jerk also sacrifices two train employees to make his escape and throws a teenage girl to the zombies. What a sorry excuse for a human being! But that's selfishness for you and that's not what makes the movie beautiful so I must move on.<br/><br/>It's the kindness and selflessness of multiple characters that won my heart, made this movie a beautiful story and caused me to give it 5 stars. It starts small, the little girl giving up her seat to the old woman but it grows. Dad shakes off his bad attitude after being called out by the Father to Be of the Pregnant Lady's baby and he starts actively helping to save people. Father to Be later pulls a heroic sacrifice to hold a door so the group can get into a train car that doesn't contain zombies, but before he does he shouts to his wife what their child's name will be. I cried. I still am sniffling. And the sports kid, he goes on a mission to free Dad's daughter, the Pregnant Lady and the old woman from a train bathroom with no benefit to himself. He does it because it's The Right Thing To Do. And I can't forget the disheveled guy, this poor man spends half his time tripping or alerting the zombies by making unintentional noise and he pulls another heroic sacrifice to save the girl and Pregnant Lady. IF YOU AREN'T CRYING THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU. <br/><br/>In fact, helping others is the only way anybody stays alive. Everyone who makes selfish choices not only dies, but causes the deaths of those around them(Suit Jerk gets the whole train car full of people eaten). Yes the selfless choice of sacrifice also gets some people killed but they knowingly give their lives so others can go on. The reward is that others live. That's what makes this movie beautiful, it looks at the lesson Dad attempted to teach his daughter at the beginning and it goes ""No. Humanity does not survive by looking out for only yourself. Humanity survives by virtue of the courage to help others, to give, to GO BACK FOR PEOPLE, to be a HERO."" In a time where it is fashionable to put forth stories where #1 looks out for only #1, where you are told that some people are too slow, useless and not worth the effort, this movie makes the case that salvation is not earned by abandoning your fellow man but earned through being willing to look past yourself and Do What Is Right.<br/><br/>And I'm sure there's symbolism to be found in the child and woman passing through the dark tunnel and being saved by the child singing but I'm too sad(in a good way) by the movie's end to figure it out."

Believe it or not, there is also humor, amazing special effects and, the cherry on the top, the little girl's performance. However, expect stupid things to happen, like people forgetting how to run, people being extra-loud, people not checking minor details like looking behind them, etc. But maybe that's too be expected in a dangerous, totally new situation? 
As a bonus, you MIGHT enjoy the lack of brain smashing scenes, brain goo, heads exploding like pumpkins, etc. so feel free to enjoy plenty of snacks while watching this zombie flick. Overall, I would call it a decent, clean zombie drama, with some horror elements and very theatrical music."

","Very few modern zombie flicks are as consistent to the tone and intent of Romero's films as this. Regularly people, living their lives, suddenly faced with terror and death. But where Night of the Living Dead is a slow-burn thriller, this is an edge-of-your-seat action-horror whirlwind. The performances are fantastic, and the final 15 minutes is unexpectedly moving. A little long and sporadically hacky? Maybebut it's mostly just a cool and scary ride."

","This is one of the better zombie movies I've seen in a long, long time. The zombies are scary and the first half of the movie packs a lot of tension. Especially the moments when the passengers(what's left of them) flee from the train and attempt to come out of a station and the utter mayhem that awaits them is probably the best part of the movie. There's good drama too, the notable among them like the father and daughter conversation or that between a pregnant wife & her husband. I was totally hooked until the final few scenes that I felt didn't pack much punch like the initial horror. There's also a particular scene towards the end where a negative character who survived so far finally gets bitten but how he turns while he still begs to be saved looked almost comical in this otherwise intense thriller. The best performances were from Eui-sung Kim as a very selfish passenger and child actor Su-an Kim. Verdict - get your popcorn & soda, and munch away your jitters while you watch this one."
"stroggos","8","1","2","20 August 2017"," More than just a zombie movie, and suspenseful nonetheless
","TRAIN TO BUSAN is a zombie movie for sure. But it's also a story about a father and his daughter. And it's a story about greed and sacrifice. This zombie movie has more heart than most other movies of the genre, yet it will also make most genre fans happy by having some pretty darn scary zombies.<br/><br/>I thought this was an all-round solid movie with some scenes that were nail-bitingly suspenseful, effective cinematography, a fast-moving plot, and some decent acting. There's a few cliché moments in there, but hey, that's o.k.! TRAIN TO BUSAN did succeed in conveying some genuine emotions, as well as a genuine sense of dread and apocalypse.

"kris_kelchtermans-263-773289","9","1","2","12 August 2017"," As good as the genre gets (and that's a compliment)
","I just finished a second viewing of this film (the first was at an art house cinema) and during this second viewing, the qualities of this picture became very clear (more so than during the first one). Yes, it does contain the zombie tropes and the characters nicely fall into the stereotypes: the jock, his girlfriend, the bad-ass, the evil businessman, Jordan Gekko, the little girl, the survivor, the old ladies,...<br/><br/>But this is where the movie's strongest asset works: like TWD, it manages to make you care about the characters. The story leaves you just enough time to connect with them. Sometimes with a slice of comic relief, although to the movie's credit, that is not overdone either. It never becomes a jokey joke-thing and that's a quality as well.<br/><br/>Once the zombies come into play, all the right buttons are pushed at the right moment. Timing is a quality not to underestimate.<br/><br/>The moments that are meant to be tension filled succeed in doing so (the actors do a great job at making the characters look determined in their quest to survive) and when it wants to tug at your heart strings... well, it simply does. Some moments (like with Jin Hee and her boyfriend) are touching, but there is a moment near the end between Jordan Gekko and the little girl that is simply gut-wrenching. In terms of emotional impact, it's right up there with Sophia walking out of the barn, if you will. But in a different way.<br/><br/>So, in short, it's a success all across the board. Highly recommended for horror fans."

","Firstly I'll like to say this film has kept to the roots of a original zombie flick. Instead of 1000 CGI zombies who you can barley take serous, this film has spent a lot of time in actors and makeup effects that slow the actor to really give a human like movement and belivement in the zombies.<br/><br/>For Asian film fans you will recognize some actors and to be honest the casting was on point. <br/><br/>The only bad thing I have to say is some scenes were a lil unbelievable and yes I know its a zombie film but I think realistic outcomes make films a how lot better."
"MargotMan","7","1","2","11 July 2017"," Decent zombie flick. Fresh, but not spectacular. Worth a watch.
","I thought this was a pretty decent zombie flick. The pacing was good, but this is an action film more than a horror film. This was more World War Z than Night of the Living Dead. Some of the scenes were a bit of a stretch of the imagination, but it is a zombie film, not a biopic. There were quite a bit of ""feels"" which is usually hard to accomplish in a zombie film, and it actually felt pretty fresh without completely rewriting the genre. The movie effectively made you like some characters, love some characters, hate some characters, you get the point.<br/><br/>Something that bothers me about zombie movies is the inconsistency of the zombie mechanics. How fast and strong a zombie is, how fast people turn, etc. This movie is pretty notorious for this. One minute, people take what seems to be up to 15 minutes plus to turn, then next minute people are turning immediately. Zombies are jumping over objects and mangling a group of people, and then in the next scene one man can hold back an entire zombie hoard by himself without a scratch. It definitely pulls you away from the story for a moment. <br/><br/>Overall though, this was a decent film, and I had fun watching it. In the end, this is an action/horror film that should be treated as such. Don't expect everything to make perfect sense and don't expect stellar dialog and acting, although the acting is very decent for an action/horror film."
"bravesfanc","8","1","2","2 July 2017"," A fun thriller
","This is only the second Korean film I've ever watched, (the first one being ""OldBoy"")and like ""Oldboy"" I enjoyed this quite a bit. The story is about a father who has a strained relationship with his young daughter, so much so the daughter wants to leave him and live with her mom instead. The daughter wants to ride the train by herself to Busan, the father decides he needs to go with her to try and save what little is left on his relationship with his daughter.<br/><br/>Once on the train the fun truly begins. The ""zombies"" are relentless and people turn quite quickly after being bitten which I thought was awesome. Another aspect of the zombies was when the train would go through tunnels, the zombies effectively go blind. When a group of survivors need to get through a few of the train cars they use this to their advantage but only have a certain amount of time before the train comes out of the tunnel.<br/><br/>You feel for the ""good guys"" and there are some comedic moments to relieve the tension with a few one liners here and there. One problem I had was towards the end, some of the decisions that were made by the protagonist weren't really smart compared to the others that were made earlier in the film. But just a minor blip in what was otherwise a fun and entertaining zombie movie."

","Opinion about Train to Busan (2016) Train to Busan is a film of the year 2016. Directed by Sang-ho Yeon. Seok-woo (Yoo Gong) an entrepreneur goes on a train to base to see the mother of his daughter (Soo-an). But u zombie apocalypse to prevent them. Passing along with other people must survive on the train. What will? The movie in general I liked a lot. I was as usual with the theme of the zombies. But throughout the film increases the fear of the zombies. The movements of the zombies i found it very good, such as robotic to be transformed.<br/><br/>Another important point of the film is the closeness that one has with the main characters, a don't know not how is called but just as you want it. And that is difficult to do. That closeness to the characters are shown in a trilogy, but here we only have one movie to love them.<br/><br/>The deaths in the film seem to me to be sooooooooo unexpected, which gives a touch of surprise. Not as The Walking Dead, you say ""Not that cannot die because it is the protagonist"" here that doesn't happen. Anyone can die.<br/><br/>What I liked the most of the film is the pace you take. From start to finish. Sitting quietly on the train, to be fighting against zombies. You should not take your eyes to the screen, because you will miss out on something incredible.<br/><br/>What I found stupid in the movie, is that if the zombies don't see you don't eat. I found it ridiculous. But it gives a new twist to the movie, something more radical.<br/><br/>I liked a lot 8/10"

","A typical American movie from the Korean's point of view, that's enough to pay my ticket. Beyond the zombie cinematic, and great and atypical action scenes, Train to Busan contains some critics to the western culture. In one of them It makes a critic to the individuality through the role of a Broker, a Korean in an typical American job, who fights for his only life and that of his daughter, forgetting the life of anybody else. Every man for himself or a sense of community. American perspective or Asian fellowship culture."

","The dead are rising and biting people, spreading panic and infection all across South Korea (and possibly the world) The main character is trapped on a train with his daughter headed for supposed safety.<br/><br/>The zombies are of the fast-moving infected variety but with some very refreshing oriental twists. Once bitten the infected spring up with their limbs at unnaturally sharp angels, as if pulled up by strings like a marionette.<br/><br/>Although this is a zombie movie it has heavy elements of the old 1970's disaster movies I was bought up on. There are some very clear stereotypes who tend to act out according to role. All the characters are forced together in a restricted environment and its not long before zombies become everyone's second biggest problem.<br/><br/>I have seen a million zombies films, I tend to like each one less than the previous but this was the exception.<br/><br/>You are one step ahead of the story most of the way but that didn't ruin my enjoyment.<br/><br/>Think ""Day of the Dead"" meets ""Towering Inferno"" with a pinch of ""The Grudge"""

","First, let me say that I am not a fan of the zombie genre. World War Z was okay, I thought. The Walking Dead bored me.<br/><br/>This Korean movie will likely (like Oldboy) get a US remake so the snowflakes who are upset by subtitles will get to see a Hollywoodized version at some point in the future. No doubt the plot will be changed through committee interference. <br/><br/>In this movie, our protagonist isn't the most likable person... and don't expect Hollywood to leave his character arc untouched.<br/><br/>Enjoy this one in its present form. It does an excellent job with a growing feeling of dread that turns into an all out chase film with twists and surprising script decisions. Some old character stereotypes are worked in, but there are plenty of unexpected turns and clever solutions.<br/><br/>Like The Host, another Korean film I particularly like, there's family drama at the core. But it doesn't overwhelm the sheer ferocity of the action."

","A rather neglectful father is taking his daughter by train to visit her mother on the day the zombie apocalypse hits. Naturally zombies get on the train and all hell breaks loose. ""Zombies on a train"" doesn't sound like the most original concept, but writer/director Sang Ho-Yeon not only manages to find interesting things to do with it, he rather effortlessly stretches it out to 2 hours of really intense action ... and he works in some interesting character dynamics too. There's nothing startling here, but it's not predictable and it's actually rather difficult to predict who will live and who will die. Great stuff especially for a really tired genre."
"elmeanyo-48242","9","1","2","27 March 2017"," WWZ... in Korea!
","This flick could be during the WWZ universe, but in another place, South Korea. The zombies behave just like the WWZ zombies. Bite you, 1-2 mins later, depending on the severity of your injuries, and you are a fast running, hyper-athletic flesh eater, pulsating in crowds fighting over each other to get at the living flesh in a undead wave.<br/><br/>Other than the characteristics of the zombies, the movie is quite different from the aforementioned title. The scope is contained to a relatively small band of survivors, trapped on a high-speed train from NW Seoul to SW Busan during the onset of an outbreak.<br/><br/>The scope of the movie concentrates on a 30-something fund manager and his neglected 10-yo daughter, on their way to visit her mother and his ex-wife. Begrudgingly, he accepts this journey in an effort to please his daughter on her birthday, a day in which he gives her the same present he gave her last year. Much tears and reflection sets up the strain between the two and his later efforts to redeem himself.<br/><br/>From here, all hell breaks loose. An infected passenger soon turns the bulk of the passengers on the train into zombies, in a scene very reminiscent of the WWZ airplane scene. The end result is the survivors desperately trying to survive in the enclosures between the train-cars.<br/><br/>Like any good disaster movie, just when you think it can't get worse, it does. That is as far as I will go with the plot, to avoid spoilers.<br/><br/>So, I loved the movie, but it requires you to not think about the logic too much, if you know anything about Korea. The fact that the infection spreads faster than a speeding train. That no guns or military presence is available, despite the fact that every Korean male is required to serve in the military for X number of years. For most western audiences, they won't notice and it doesn't detract from the fun.<br/><br/>A++"
"donb-519-335075","9","1","2","25 March 2017"," The best since Dawn of the Dead - remake
","The first big budget zombie flick from South Korea. ""Train to Busan"" is terrific.<br/><br/>Starting slowly like most zombie movies (something is wrong) it takes off and does not stop until (SPOILER ALERT) almost all the main characters have been dispatched. This is non stop action and excitement for almost the entire 2 hours. Just when the zombie genre is on life support (""The Walking Dead "" Season 7 is dying and killing all of us in the process), the Koreans have shown that there still is life in the genre.<br/><br/>There are several new elements: (SPOILER ALERT II) most of the action takes place on a train; the heroes have to fight and trick their way to other survivors; the zombies are terrific - a lot of weird jerking around (reminiscent of the priest in the opening scenes of ""28 Days Later""); lots of zombies cascading through windows and falling over each other; an amazing train escape sequence you have to see; and numerous other very creative takes on the ""Zombie chasing humans"" device.<br/><br/>But this is more than just wild zombie action. This is a story about self interest; caring for others; being willing to help; a father's redemption with his daughter, and the struggle between good and evil (naturally.)<br/><br/>I have not enjoyed a zombie flick in many years - this one makes my all time top 10.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the genre, this one is a must see.

This is much better than Snowpiercer, and conveys the zombie satire of society every bit as well as Romero. Plus the emotional moments are truly good.

","A group of terrified passengers fight their way through a viral outbreak while trapped on a bullet train ride to Busan.<br/><br/>Train to Busan is a blood-drenched South Korean zombie/virus horror, director Yeon Sang-ho and writer Park Joo-suk offer a serious zombie apocalypse yarn. Interestingly most of the bloody, milky eyed and black vein thrilled story is set in the daytime. Joo-suk offers a novel take on the infected, which cannot see in the dark, this makes for some interesting viewing during the more tense scenes especially as the train travels through darkened tunnels.<br/><br/>Sang-ho's twitchy infected are a fast moving reminiscent of 28 Days Later and WWZ at one point there are piles of clambering dead hanging from the locomotive. In addition, this is a decent looking film, not a straight to video, DTV offering, the production values are high and the special effects are impressive. The locations are grounded which adds to the tension and you buy into the characters plight along with the punchy surprise deaths synonymous with the genre. With mistrust between the players there's a social commentary about the division of class and its pecking order, its only apt it's set on a train. <br/><br/>There are some action packed segments in stations and some subtler moments in tunnels and the city as the survivors encounter the army and contaminated. Surprisingly there's plenty of emotion especially between workaholic Seok-woo played by Gong Yoo and his young daughter, Soo- an, delightfully played by Kim Su-an who wants to see her mother. Notable is Ma Dong-seok who plays Sang-hwa, a tough, working-class man. Dong-seok delivers some memorable zombie head bashing moments. <br/><br/>Sang-ho balances the intense infected action and drama perfectly. Highly recommended virus film."

A Train to Busan is not just a thrilling, fast-pacing zombie movie - it is as much so about friendship, love, introspection,... in short all the things that separate us from the Undead. Korean filmmakers have a clever way of mixing the genres so flawlessly (comedy, family-drama, horror), that you'll find yourself crying and smiling at the same time. The build up is perfect (The opening scene in particular is very memorable- amazing special effects). Some of the scenes are heartbreaking, the girl in particular acts astonishing well and you'll find yourself on the tip of your seat vowing for that train to make it to Busan."

Sang-ho Yeon does an incredible job with the film, and the actors give equally masterful performances. Watching the film I did feel as though there was a slight translational discrepancy between the Korean of the movie and the English subtitles, and that the movie held a slightly different meaning in its native tongue that couldn't be realistically kept across the translation. This did not detract from my experience overall and should not deter potential audience members. A must-have to any zombie movie watch list, this film cant be missed. Be warned however, 'Train to Busan' is not for the feint of heart, prepare yourself, and find someone to hold close, you'll probably be glad you did."
"Vikingbyheart","8","1","2","29 September 2016"," A great horror action zombie film!
","Horror movies were never the same after the zombie trilogy by the director George Andrew Romero. In Night of the Living Dead (1968) we were presented to zombies who eat human flesh, a thriller mixing horror and social criticism. In the second film, Dawn of the Dead (1978), besides the social satire about paranoia and humanity to the brink of apocalypse, the movie explores the comic potential of zombies, especially black humor. We are the headless and cannibalistic beings who roam the cities. Closing the trilogy, Day of the Dead (1985) continues with the social criticism and the comic tone, but relies on a more depressive and gloomy scenario, apart from the use of graphic violence. Following the footsteps of George Romero we have the gore Braindead (1992), the horror 28 Days Later (2002) and Rec (2007), and in humor genre, Shaun of the Dead (2004), Zombieland (2007) and Død snø - Dead Snow (2009).<br/><br/>The South Korean movie Busanhaeng (original title) or Train to Busan (english title) focuses on horror and action, with some moments of suspense. Written and directed by Sang-ho Yeon (known for the zombie animation Seoul Station - 2016), the film tells the story of a financial sector executive, Seok Woo (played by Yoo Gong, known for Do-ga-ni - Silenced - 2011) who agrees to travel with his daughter, Soo-an (represented by Soo Kim-an), from the capital Seoul to the city of Busan for she spends some time with her mother (Seok's ex- wife). After embarking on a modern express train (KTX) passengers discover that an epidemic is raging South Korea, turning much of the population into zombies. With an infected person on board and the disease rapidly spreading, father, daughter and other passengers will have to fight for survival and for their lives, trapped inside a high-speed moving train.<br/><br/>The director Sang-ho Yeon does a great job, managing to immerse the viewer in the plot. Despite most of the action been set in a train the film has a dynamic narrative and impresses for its visual and technical accuracy. Unlike the slow zombies of George Romero's trilogy in Train to Busan they are extremely agile, threatening and lethal. Another highlight is the cast. The characters are well developed, even for a horror movie and the actors deliver relevant performances, especially Sang Hwa (played by Dong-seok Ma, known for Joheunnom Nabbeunnom Isanghannom - The Good, The Bad, The Weird - 2008), the girl in the role of the daughter, Soo-an Kim, and Yoo Gong acting as the father. The soundtrack and sound effects are moderate, providing genuine scares.<br/><br/>There are still some elements in the movie of South Korean culture, as the obsession with education and study, and a strong critique of modern society. The quest for professional success even at the expense of family and leisure time is questioned in the film, as well as the social tension. Moral and ethical conflicts involving empathize or not for others and follow or not the animal instinct of self- preservation are exploited by different profiles of the surviving passengers.<br/><br/>Despite having some clichés of the zombie genre Busanhaeng is a great horror film, with good moments of suspense, well-constructed action scenes, a well-chosen cast and the right amount of tension to captivate the viewer."

As most would agree, the big Jackie Chan-looking guy was the best. The main Dad character was pretty bland. His ending arc was kinda cheesy, like a typical Korean Drama.<br/><br/>Then we have the typical over-the-top d-bag villian. The writers went out of there way to get the audience to hate the guy as much as possible. I don't know, just seems cheap, in my opinion. Th villian was pretty lame and cliche.<br/><br/>But what's up with so many people gushing over the pretty cheerleader? Don't get my wrong, she is quite pretty, but too many people are making a huge deal out of her beauty when it's not even nesscary. Guys acting like virgins who's never seen a pretty girl before. I've even seen reviews that just talk about this girls looks, and barely review the movie itself, then they rate it like a 9/10 or 10/10, LOL! Why would someone base a movie review off the looks of just one character? That doesn't make sense for a movie review.<br/><br/>But for all the characters, they lacked real actual character development. They are all kinda bland, one-note, and with not much real growth. But the movie is more focused on just them escaping zombies. This movie would've been amazing if they developed the characters more and had some originality for the zombie genre.<br/><br/>The movie is still worth seeing for the amazing special effects and suspense. It's best watched with friends or girlfriend. But movie is nothing of substance that will stick with you, for me at least."

"80sHorror","10","2","7","5 February 2017"," Bloody"" awesome! # 1 zombie movie , must see
","The best zombie film I've seen in a long time. With its ultra fast piling over each other infected undead it is more in the style of World War Z than TV's The Walking Dead and also does not have the latter's extreme gore. There is enough blood and violence so it is not too light for a hardened zombie fan but focuses more on tension and action. It also managed to build up the characters so I cared about them and once that happens the tension stakes are that much higher. The main characters are a business man and his young daughter on a train when a zombie apocalypse begins. Death while infected causes people to instantly turn so one infected girl on the train causes the infection to spread like wildfire and very soon two groups of survivors remain, separated by infected carriages. Edge of the seat tension and many action set pieces follow as the smaller group tries to get to the front of the train and things escalate in all sorts of ways with some unexpected turns, big action, all building to a powerful climax. I loved it and was gripped from start to finish, I'm a big zombie fan and it did not disappoint. It's serious in tone and has some great character drama with some decent arcs and things play out in ways that have just a slight spin against Western expectations. The zombies are really well done, not too heavily made up (they're fresh) but they move well, all twitchy and sometimes freaky spasms, very fast and lethal. It is Korean language with subtitles but is not dialogue heavy. The DVD also includes behind the scenes footage and 2 trailers for the director's forthcoming Seoul Station which is a cartoon that appears part of this same undead world."

","""28 Days later"", ""28 Weeks Later"", and both George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead""and ""Dawn of the Dead"" (And also Zack Snyder's remake) – these are the great movies of the horror-zombie genre; although we could all agree that Romero started it all. Then in 2016, in the south of Korea, we got another zombie flick. I can't tell on how this movie was being received worldwide, but here in Singapore, the 'praises' for it is a bit overdone in my opinion. The result is predictable as neo-musical genre 'K-POP' is popular here. So, any entertainment that shows intimacy with the mentioned phenomenon, will get extra attention.<br/><br/>A young fund manager (Gong Yoo) agrees to bring his daughter (Kim Su-an) to Busan to visit her mother. Since the child's parents are separated, I assume the two parties occasionally meet one another. From the start to the point upon the boarding of the train for Busan, the movie is well made. 'Zombies' in norm only needs one infected for the thrill to start. Hence, in ""Train to Busan"" an infected manages to secretly board the train.<br/><br/>Director Yeon Sang-ho's effort in exploiting small details can easily be admired. The images of emergency vehicles, the all- encompassing violent fires at the near top of a building and ashes steadily settling down from it – all allow audiences to sense something unsound had happened, although we all know that it is the omnipresent of zombie outbreak.<br/><br/>That's it. After the first zombie begins to bite, the movie goes into a nosedive motion. Action sequences are surprisingly bland; I cannot specifically describe on what's lacking but it lacks genuine excitement. The writing for the characters too shares the same fate (especially the villain) as they are clichéd. What ""Train to Busan"" tried to depict on the 'colours' of its characters had already been done by dozens of movies before; worst when it lays out that idea before our very eyes and never challenges the audiences. And visual style is straight terrible. The only element which remains to be positive is the effective use of suspense throughout the movie.<br/><br/>As a zombie-genre fan, I quickly got for myself a ticket to experience it at the cinema but only to leave the hall feeling disappointed. My criticism does not mean I abhor Korean movies. Movie fans in general would know that Koreans had made great films for the past years. One of them is ""I Saw the Devil"" by Kim Jee- Woon, which is a masterpiece in any way. But unfortunately this ""Train to Busan"" is vastly overrated.<br/><br/>Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com"

The special effects weren't too over the top and there were plenty of pretty realistic bits to everything. In comparison I would say these zombies are similar to ones in World War Z or 28 Weeks Later.<br/><br/>The difference between this movie and those other 2 is that this storyline is much better. There wasn't some special person on a special mission or anything extravagant. It was a normal dad and his daughter as well as other seemingly normal people going on a normal train ride that ends up being far from normal. Although no character was super special, it was still action packed and as realistic as you can get with zombie movies. To me that's what made it so amazing. Bonus points for actually killing off a main character since that usually never happens!<br/><br/>There is also something to be said about the little girl. She was phenomenal for being so young and added so much to the movie. I didn't expect a movie like this to be so emotional, but she sure made it that way with several scenes. More notably when her dad got bit. That was a tough scene to watch because her emotions felt so real.<br/><br/>All the other actors were great as well! I don't believe there was a single one that really sucked. Although there isn't much background with every secondary character, you still gather enough information about who they are as people as things progress. This helped with the very intense scenes where one would die off.<br/><br/>I don't watch many Korean movies, or many other foreign films for that matter, but this has me wanting to watch more. The only difficult part was having to read subtitles and possibly missed some stuff by doing so, but there was so much other good to this movie that I didn't care in the end. Even for it being a pretty lengthy movie, which is usually a huge turnoff for me. Surprisingly I kept up from start to finish!<br/><br/>An issue I noticed that was different than others was that there didn't seem to be a certain timeframe that one would turn rabid once they got bit. It seemed to vary depending on who got bit and where we were in the movie. It could be more intense that way considering you don't know when it will happen. Or it could be a bit of a plot whole. Just depends on how you look at it. There was also a little inconsistency with breaking glass being that sometimes they could break through and other times they couldn't although the glass is all the same.<br/><br/>Another weird/confusing bit was when they went through tunnels and the zombies all of a sudden couldn't see. When that happened the zombies literally went mute pretty much and stopped attacking. But they could hear things still. The only problem I had with that is they made a point to say that they got angry when they saw the characters still alive. So do they get angry off seeing them? Or is it the noises the people make?? It seemed to be a little weird to have that part in there and didn't make much sense to me watching it play out.<br/><br/>Besides those few negatives, this movie still had so much else to offer. I would still recommend to anyone that's into zombie-type moves. Really glad I stumbled upon it!"

","Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.<br/><br/>The film's plot is just dumb. The film is made up of every cliched zombie plot point. All gobbled up in one single movie. It's just what I say lazy writing. No character development (urggh I know this is a zombie movie but still) Somehow few small events are supposed to define the characters present in the movie. But that's not how things work. If you are selfishly saving your ass and then suddenly if a girl lectures you to ""always think about others"", you can't become the Hero of the Humanity in a second. You can't write full character arcs in a film which is just showing events of few hours. (I mean you can but you need to be a very great writer to pull that off, in this case it wasn't). And just because of this lack of character development, I wasn't entirely rooting for anyone to get saved (to be honest there were times when I was wishing no one survives in the train).<br/><br/>And what is this obsession of killing each and every character in overtly melodramatic way? I get it people are dying. But if that is happening so frequently as in this movie then I can't cry for every character's death.<br/><br/>The only thing which was impressing were the zombies. No back story. Lethal. Ready in no time (But yet there were some convenient exceptions). And dumb. Just like the entire film."

"philipposathina","10","1","3","22 November 2018"," a horror film and a drama in one package
","Actually a very good one in both categories. Korean cinema has given some very good movies in the past -starting from the excellent ""old boy""- and has already been recognised as an asset in movie industry, so it would be rather foolish to undervalue its films as coming from a country far too remote, far too culturally different, far too unknown to pay some attention to its productions.
I started watching this film with no prejudice but also not been sure of the quality of what i was to watch. Right from the begining it was apparent that it was a serious production and not at all a cheap cartoon style film from a ""third"" country. And so it proved to be till its very end: A very well made zombie/horror film and not at all only. Through the story line and using the zombie issue as an excuse and cause, there was a very clear and interesting effort to point out the contrast of ""good"" and ""evil"" in human nature, and that is among living humans themselves. You add to this the really tender family drama unfolding along a very well and quite realistically made adventure and you have a film which captures your attention from the very beginning and finally leaves you very moved and in tears.
Last but not least: The excellent acting -the little girl will break your heart especially in the final scene- and the amazing, musically simple yet really imposing, epic music score in the ending credits.
Do watch it, worths every penny of it!"

","Train to Busan Review<br/><br/>This was THE BEST zombie flick I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot). It's hyper intense, emotional and heartbreaking all at the same time. I've never seen anything quite like it.<br/><br/>I absolutely LOVE how it shows the rapid decline of civilization. One minute people are just normal people. The next minute those same people are leaving children and the elderly for dead just to save their own skin. It's visceral, disturbing and ABSOLUTELY realistic (which is something zombie movies rarely are).<br/><br/>The movie is extremely fast paced and rarely takes its foot off of the accelerator. This keeps you on the edge of your seat, and always wondering what's going to happen next.<br/><br/>The director did an excellent job at painting a scenario where no one was safe. You feel the same way about the characters too. You really don't have any clue who's going to die next, and that's SO refreshing to me.<br/><br/>If you're like me and love all things zombie related then you HAVE to watch this film!"

Even though it's a 2 hour movie, you just can't get enough of it and wanting for more. Like it should be a 3 hour movie. It really hooks your attention to it.<br/><br/>The characters are convincing.

"HumanLifeMovie","9","1","3","9 September 2017"," Investigate humanities ego-tripping psyche in a zombie movie
","I believe this is the best zombie film I've seen so far. It is not overdone, like so many of the big screen zombie films are. There is some kind of outbreak at a facility and people are evacuated. During the outbreak day a girl is going to visit her mother in another place. To reach the destination she has to take the train to Busan. This trip turns out differently than expected. During their trip there is a outbreak of a zombie sickness. People simply turn into zombies and try to eat non infected people. This outbreak also happens on the train. How will they handle it? Is there any way to survive this train trip and reach the destination? There is a lot of blood and splatter and if you are a sensitive person this is not a film for you. But if you adore zombie movies, this is one of the better ones. It is not overcooked, no this production is just right. It is enough of everything. Somehow this movie also investigates how far you are willing to go for your self interests. Are you willing to help other's on your way? Or are you ego, just doing what benefits you, even if that means other people dying? Somehow this is about how we people turn on each other in crises. So who are you, the good samaritan or the self-centered asshole? Well, I guess Train to Busan just puts all these things on display. You might even learn something about humanity watching this zombie movie. Interesting right? It's well worth seeing this movie. Sit down, be on the edge for a while. The grade is a grade set where I compare it with other zombie movies."

","I can't possibly see enough Zombie movies before I die so I jumped into this one with few reservations even though it almost totally takes place on a train. The director did come through for me with excitement and gore aplenty .<br/><br/>Asian action movies tend to be very direct and stereo-typical. There's usually a strong lead, a very evil character, pretty girls who require protection, and lots of cannon fodder bystanders.<br/><br/>TRAIN TO BUSAN has all these hall-marks and, since I really love the Asian style, I really got into it.<br/><br/>A few scenes were quite spectacular in the ferocity of the Zombie attacks. The carpet of zombies hanging off the back of the train was inspired.

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Train to Busan"" (2016) was hands down the most involving, intriguing, nail biting and visceral experience I've seen in many moons, considering this so called ""zombie"" genre. It has more in common with ""28 Days Later"" then G.Romero zombies and even ""World War Z"" influence is pretty obvious. But ""Train to Busan"" was by a moon better then ""World War Z"" - at running time 1 h 50 min. i wished it didn't ended and that happens rarely in movies these days. <br/><br/>This is a superbly crafted picture from start till finish. The first ~50 min where nothing short of spectacular - great special effects, superbly constructed action / chase set piece at the station, clear character development and very clear and involving narrative. Second part of the film was just great - a nail biting horror / thriller. <br/><br/>Overall, if you do like zombie movies - ""Train to Busan"" delivers goods - big time. This is one of the best if not the best example in this genre in some long time. I wasn't a sequel."

","Second Korean movie that I watched this week and again it won me over. For a zombie movie, that has been done over and over again, this one is much better then most of the other zombie movies. With zombie movies you always get the same story with the same slow pasting zombies. In Busanhaeng though the zombies could compete with Usain Bolt over the 100 meters. They are fast and extremely aggressive. And that's only a positive thing for the suspense in a zombie movie. So it's absolutely not like in The Walking Dead where there they are literally just walking and a grandmother with a wooden leg could outrun them. I can't remember any name of the actors nor understand a word of what they saying but I have to admit that there are pretty good actors in Korea. Overall I would give this movie a seven star rating but as a movie in the zombie genre it deserves an eight because it's way better then other zombie movies. Great acting, a good story, fast aggressive and bloody action, you won't get bored for a second."

The movie is exceptional not because is good but because it has a very twisting line. You may think a favorite character will live but he/she wont. Imagine Game of Thrones, right? They die a lot. Now add zombies, add a high speed moving train, add a yakuza, some teenagers and the cliché ""pregnant lady"".

Here we are in a train with a bunch of likable and memorable characters as the zombie outbreak happens, and there's little suspense but plenty of quick action in each scene. This is again an accomplishment since quick sequences of action one after the other is harder to get right without leaving mistakes for the audience to point out.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean this movie doesn't resort to many zombie tropes, in the sort of way that makes you think it is consciously doing so. But that's all fun and good. The fast, bone cracking zombie acrobats are also captivating.<br/><br/>For me, it's biggest accomplishment would be to put so much emotion and meaning in the death of one character at a point in the film when most of the audience would be desensitized to death. Yes, this movie was the first in a LONG time to make me tear up. <br/><br/>So, whether you like Zombie movies or not, give Train to Busan a try.

The acting was excellent, particularly, the minuscule actress, Kim Su-An, who steals the entire movie, particularly the last few minutes - an award-winning performance. Yes, the ending is a little overly emotional, but I guess that's how it is with some foreign movies. People who are saying detrimental things about this movie are simply not remembering movies like: World War Z (the plot line of which is so fantastical it beggars belief). The simple fact is that this is the best zombie movie I've ever seen. It's well worth seeing (with subtitles).

The trailer was really interesting and the movie was even better. Some things that distracted me were some points in the story which I didn't quite understand why it had to happen and some frustrating parts.<br/><br/>I also was a little worried how this zombie movie would turn out, how the effects might not be very realistic, and how it might be just one of those cliché Korean dramatic movies. However, it was much more thrilling and focused than I had expected it to be. The situations were realistic and somehow relatable to what can actually happen in Korea, and the rest of the world even. Not as in the zombie virus spreading, but what could cause people to die and how people would react to such calamity.<br/><br/>The reaction of the people was actually one of the best parts of the movie. Unlike most zombie movies, that focus more on the grotesque effects and horrifying happenings, this movie focuses on the psychological conflicts between the people and within oneself. It is quite tragic what happens in the movie, but that makes it more sensible and realistic. I could really get into the mood and the nervous terror of the situations in the movie, and of course, with the aid of some great actors and actresses."

Furthermore, the makeup and/or masks of the zombies is not realistic or cool at all. For sure you won't miss the blood stain in the orange color. This movie doesn't follow the same rules as the usual Hollywood movies. It seems very important to the director to point out some ethical views, unfortunately the same aspect over and over.<br/><br/>So what's left?<br/><br/>I think some pretty nice and fresh ideas. I really like the minimalist setting with the train. This doesn't give the story that much space and I think ""not that much of space"" is a key point in Zombie movies.

","First of all. WOW! I watched it with a concern that it would just be another zombie movie where flat main characters fight zombies for no purpose other than their survival. I was totally wrong.
The main characters are introduced quite well at the begging, and well developed during the movie. For example the dad. A fund manager by the name of Seok-woo, is shown since the start that he is not a guy that spends time with his daughter, he shows it by giving her a Wii when she already had one. During the duration of the train ""adventure"" the son and daughter develop a relationship that was hidden inside of both of their minds. All of that is shown when the dad is bitten, the kid does not want to let him go. 
In the end everything about this movie is great."

","""Seok-woo"" (Yoo Gong) is a fund manager who spends all of his time at the office which has subsequently damaged his marriage beyond repair. As luck would have it, however, he happens to have his young daughter ""Soo-an"" (Su-an Kim) with him for a few days and to cheer her up agrees to accompany her on the morning train from Seoul to Busan to be with her mother. However, upon boarding the train they discover that a zombie apocalypse has just started in Korea and that they are trapped inside one of the passenger cars with no ability to escape. As a result the uninfected passengers are forced to band together to keep the determined zombies as bay. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fairly solid zombie film which emphasized the ultra-fast variety in lieu of the typical slow-moving type. Because of that the action is quite brisk which initially worked quite well for the majority of the film. Unfortunately, I must admit that the non-stop action tended to become somewhat tedious after a while. Likewise, the rather poor ending didn't exactly help in that regard either. In any case, as I stated earlier this was a decent zombie movie for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Average."

"MinusEleven","10","1","4","13 October 2018"," A Great Action Thriller
","Train to Busan is a pleasure to watch. It takes the classic pandemic zombie and combines it with the isolated environment of a speeding train to great effect. The pandemic/contagion element is interwoven with ideas of environmentalism and morality. Trapping the characters in an enclosed space with the monster creates tension and conflict in a way that is somewhat reminiscent of a science fiction movie set on a spaceship or an action movie set on a submarine. These elements converge as tensions rise and the movie turns to exploring the darkest, as well as the most selfless, parts of human nature in the way that post-apocalyptic movies seem to do so well.<br/><br/>This ideological framework is brought to life by some fantastic acting and great character writing that really draws you into the movie. The cinematography and visual storytelling are exceedingly well done and create a distinctive atmosphere. This is a movie that feels like it was built off of many well crafted details.<br/><br/>Train to Busan isn't particularly gorey or terrifying and leans more towards the action/thriller category. It creates intrigue through the failings of the characters and humanity as a whole as well as the hope for redemption. <br/><br/>Although the movie becomes a little ""over the top"" towards the end, it doesn't prevent this movie in being 10/10."

"Bored_Dragon","7","1","4","23 November 2017"," Good but overrated
","When I sit to watch zombie movie I expect horror, action, maybe even comedy, I expect B production and certain level of frivolity. Instead, Train to Busan brings A production and very serious drama. Essentially, this is not a zombie movie. This is movie about human relations and what they become in state of panic. Story that is seen many times before, but it's usually placed in war or natural disaster surrounding, while here they placed it in zombie apocalypse. This is not original story, this is just somewhat original mash-up of pretty much outworn clichés. Mash-up of disaster drama and zombie apocalypse we already have in Walking Dead. Walking Dead + Snowpiercer = Train to Busan. So, it's definitely not original. Further, action part of the story is painfully dumb. again we have bunch of people acting stupid and illogical in order to stretch movie to two hours. Most obvious example are survivors piercing through wagons crowded with zombies. In every new wagon they find different way to get from back to front door, risking their lives again and again. The only goal of those inventive new solutions is to fill half of the movie with thrilling action, while there is simple, obvious and safe solution put aside as it does not exist. Simply tell driver to stop the train in next tunnel (cause zombies attack only people they clearly see), then leave the train through door, walk outside the train to desired wagon, enter it and journey can be continued. Logical, practical, safe, but also a scene that would last just a few minutes and deprived us of the most exciting part of the movie. Stupidity and illogicality in service of agony prolongation is something we are used to in most of horror movies, but in serious drama it simply doesn't hold. Technically and visually it's well done and personal drama is deep and strong, but overall this is unoriginal movie with stupid plot and bunch of redundant action. And it does not have even H of horror.<br/><br/>6,5/10"

"mhorg2018","8","1","4","10 March 2017"," One of the most unique Zombie movies ever
","When I first heard of this, I sighed. Now Zombies on a train? But this is a really different film that shows the best and worst of humanity while trying to survive. When an outbreak of violence starts sweeping South Korea, A father (who has little time for her) and his daughter are, with others including a working man and his pregnant wife, a High School Baseball team and a CEO (the one stereotype in the movie) on a train. Before the train can leave, an injured woman staggers on. As the trains pulling out we see others attacked on the platform. For now the travelers are blissfully unaware... This is anything but an average zombie movie. Some may compare it to 28 Days Later (but those weren't zombies, they were infected and living). The zombies in this are unique in ways that I won't give away. They share more of a kinship with the terrible World War Z (this is a hundred times better)in their swarming ways. I would have thought that a movie set nearly entirely on a train would be slow, possibly boring - but it's not. Between moving at breakneck speed, this movie is claustrophobic and creepy. Well worth seeing."
"yunusknudsen","10","1","4","28 January 2017"," All aboard the feels train
","If I had to describe this movie with one word, it would've been tremendous. I was eating a sandwich at the beginning of the movie but as it progressed I got so engaged that I forgot to eat it. Get ready for an action packed thriller. We've all watched Hollywood zombie movies but this movie just takes it to another level. I myself am not specifically a fan of Korean movies myself but this movie is worth watching. The pacing of the movie was a bit slow in the beginning but as the movie progressed it went from zero to hero real quick. As you watch the movie you bond with different types of characters which in my opinion, all of them represent a specific person in society. Eg. the businessman represents the guy who works a lot, gains a lot of money and thinks he is above all. The husband of the pregnant women; the guy who is always a bit humorous and would sacrifice himself for the sake of others. The father is also the person who works his butt off but is always a bit selfish. But as always he/she realises what he/she has done and regrets his choices in his past. Towards the end of the movie everybody probably smirked at the death of COO of the train company. But also, when the father tried saving his daughter and the pregnant women, he got bit. As the girl started crying ""father don't leave me"", I admit I cried too.I would watch it again although I know the plot."

","I came across this by accident, and I am so glad I did. This is by far one of the best horror films of 2016. <br/><br/>Set on a high speed train traveling through South Korea on just another day, the passengers are trapped inside a fast paced metal coffin of death, along with victims from a virus outbreak. It doesn't take long until the the situation is out of control and people are forced to defend themselves against certain death any way they can. The film is a road-map into the emotions of humans in a crisis. Ans we get to watch in horror as fear and panic claims just as many lives as the infected. We follow a random selection of passengers, but we closely follow the divorced father who has brought his young daughter on the train to visit her mother on her birthday. That movement from train-car to train-car could be a step towards safety just as death, and all the traits that make up who you are could be what saves you or lead to your demise.<br/><br/>Amazing performances from the entire cast.

","I'm a big fan of zombie movies and Train to Busan did not disappoint, and once again leads to me to believe Korean cinema, not Japanese, is still the most creative of Asian films.<br/><br/>Train to Busan takes place almost entirely within a high speed train. We follow a group of passengers, a stockbroker father with his daughter, on the way to see her mom, a team of baseball players, a CEO and a couple where the woman is pregnant. The film has some great characters and we quickly come to care about them, which is critical in such a film. There's a great sense of humor throughout, I laughed most at the husband to the pregnant wife, a macho character of sorts.<br/><br/>The plot premise is simple, a zombie outbreak spreads at blinding speed through Korea, and so does it aboard the train. The challenge: can our heroes survive the train ride to Busan. Much happens underway and no need to spoil it. What makes Train to Busan a great zombie movie is it's part great scares, high tempo, humor. great characters and non-sentimentality. If that sounds like a lot of positive things to say, that is because the movie deserves it. It really is a must see for fans of the genre.<br/><br/>Overall the film reminds me of 28 Days Later, including the fast zombies. Definitely watch it."

Well, I've seen two or may be three films on zombies and I was never so attached to any of them like I was with Train to Busan. Story itself is so captivating that it'll leave you faint hearted. I guess I never liked any zombie film that much from my heart before that much I do like this one. The difference is, other films had lack on emotional constraints and other symptoms of zombie theory. Well TTB doesn't lack this and it is so challenging to other zombie outlets that you'll feel grabbing your seats very tight until the very end scene of the film. Sang Ho Yeon has worked very captivating and his frames are too perfect to make you wait for the climax. Even after few zombie movies from Hollywood, this one doesn't let down expectations of zombie fans. Coming to the movie, acting of protagonists is demanding and excellent. They have been shown fearful and they deliver top notch emotions. Yoo Gong, Dong-seok Ma, Woo- sik Choi are amazing to see fight zombies and they ain't making any mistakes in fear or hurrying in emotions. That's the major thing to see in this movie. About zombies, they are obviously harrowing and classically employing their duties aptly. Spreading of zombies is shown too nearly that you can't imagine which zombie is dangerously killing or who's not.

But they were very dynamic and all of the main characters seemed like they did perform well in their roles. <br/><br/>Even without subtitles I enjoyed the movie, and still understood the plot, but I would have preferred subtitles to understand all the conversations.<br/><br/>The train idea, actually worked really well, and made for some interesting sequences, with drama and a claustrophobic feel. Most of the scenarios seemed plausible, but there were a couple of times where I think the CGI were unrealistic, but surely put in there for a more dramatic feel. I think the ""passive bystander"" suspense, were a bit overused, maybe again to try and draw on the drama. Other than that, the movie were overall quite well done."

","Everything you've heard about ""Train to Busan"" (2016) is indeed correct; it's a first-rate South Korean zombie film that fans of the genre won't want to miss. I'd give it a 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>It's maybe a little campier than I expected, with some over-the-top zombies that feel more reminiscent of the ""Evil Dead"" films than George A. Romero's movies or Robert Kirkman's work. It's also a bit long at nearly two hours — if I were editing it, I would have swapped out some of the time devoted to car-to-car melees with additional scenes showing what's transpired beyond the train. Imagine how a skilled screenwriter could further expand on the (really cool) train station plot points we already see  what if the train was forced to stop at every station? What if it couldn't stop? What if its passengers were turned away at safe areas? What if desperate stragglers tried to board the train?<br/><br/>This was a good one, people. Check it out."

The movie is also not afraid to get rid of main characters and unlike movies like WWZ no main character has ""Hollywood immunity "" to getting infected and that makes the movie a lot more tense and exiting.

The makeup and effects were mediocre, and the plot too, but overall it had a good basis and is worth a run-through. That said, I'm not going to sugar coat it, I've seen better zombie flicks, and I've seen far worse. This could've passed for an 80's flick, no doubt. There was a lot of cheese, a lot of poor effects effort, hell some of the zombies looked like their regular human counterpart that was shown a few seconds ago. No effort at all to try and transition them over to an undead state aesthetically. There were parts where I paused it to go do something else, out of boredom, just to come back to it and power through. Do I think this deserves the rating it has? Nah.

","That this flick gets 7.5 on IMDB is ridiculous. The people that say ""better than Romero"" have never seen a Zombie movie. Flat story, cheap gory effects (if you can call that gory) and actors fresh from school. Every second is so predictable and the characters are just stereotypes. What a waste of time!"

","I had this movie sitting on my ""YouView"" box for quite a few months, even though I had been originally excited that Film4 had decided to air this ""little"" Korean gem of a horror movie. There had been rave reviews and more than a slight ""buzz"" about the picture. The trouble with me is that I've been let down by hyped movies before - The Blair Witch Project, a major case by example. Another trouble is my own little foibles. I don't want to be reading subtitles when I'm tired (and I do so love to watch horror flicks after the sun has set with the lights low... or off!) and I cannot stand dubbed films (too many Jackie Chan movies in my youth...). So one night, not so very long ago I was feeling awake enough to read a movie so I hit play on ""Train To Busan""...<br/><br/>By the time the end credits rolled I was amped up and wide awake. This is one hell of a rollercoaster ride of a movie and one hell of a tangle of modern-day lives story. This is not your basic Zombie flick.<br/><br/>You start out really slowly and pretty sedated. A farmer is on his way to the market when his van is stopped by men in hazmat suits. These tell him that there's nothing to worry about. There has been a slight leak at a chemical plant. After quickly decontaminating his vehicle they send him on his way... unluckily for the dear he runs down and kills. More angry at damaging his van than killing a dear he drives away leaving the carcass in the road... yeah... you know what's going to happen. Sure enough, the dead animal thrashes about and shakily gets to its feet... with a dead look in its eyes...<br/><br/>Even though this section only takes a few minutes it's one of the most superbly shot sequences I've seen in a movie. The director Yeon Sang Ho manipulates each set perfectly give the audience a creepily eerie atmosphere, which did start the shivers running up and down my spine. For that I thank them... it's been a long time since that's happened. There's nice steady sweeping camera pans. Effortlessly worked lighting. Superb control of sound... or lack of it. Even better is that all of this artwork and skill doesn't stop here it runs throughout the whole movie. It screams skill and class.<br/><br/>Then the writers, Park Joo Suk and Yeon Sang Ho, get to work weaving together tales of modern-day living. The main characters are Seok-Woo (Gong Yoo) and his daughter Soo-Ann (Kim Su An). He is a busy, work-comes-first-to-support-family guy who was already lost his wife to divorce and is now bringing up Soo-Ann, with the help of his mother. Soo-Ann is a young child who doesn't understand or appreciate her father's outlook on life. All she knows is that she doesn't see either him or her mother as much as she wants or should. She wants more time with both of her parents. So, on her birthday, after her dad buys her a repeat present (who doesn't need two Nintendo Wii's(?)) she gets him to promise to take her to see her mum for her real present. As is the usual case it's Su-An Kim's performance that steals the show - and this is as it should be.<br/><br/>This then brings them into contact with Sang-Hwa (Ma Dong Seok) and his very expectant wife Seong-Kyeong (Jung Yu Mi). Sang-Hwa and Seok-Woo do not get on at all and it's this juxtaposition in ideals and prerogatives that add more depth to the story; especially when they have to work together to survive the train ride. It's Seong-Kyeong that provides the glue to their relationship.<br/><br/>Add to this a mysterious homeless man (Choi Gwi Hwa), a couple of romantic teens getting to grips with their feelings towards each other - Yong-Guk (Choi Woo Sic) and Jin-Hee (Sohee), and officious self-centred train manager Yon-Suk (Kim Eui Sung), you have a set of characters which can create some volatile or sentimental storylines... and this is before we get to the best Zombies... EVER!<br/><br/>One of my favourite zombie flicks is Return Of The Living Dead. Two of the reasons were the zombies - they were dead and very icky (most were skinless)... and they were fast. The brain-eating buggers didn't shamble after you. And you have the same here. Though these dead aren't so skinless they are damned fast and furious.<br/><br/>This adds to some pretty spectacular action scenes in the movie which Yuen Sang Ho directs magnificently. But, whereas, most directors would opt for action over horror and story Yuen is proficient in all styles. The scenes where the dead reanimate are both startling, invigorating, eerie, and full of style and strength.<br/><br/>This is a tour-de-force of filmmaking, let alone horror filmmaking. Everything in this movie is excellent, from the story to the acting to the directing."

","I've seen my fair share of zombie flicks and this one's up there with the greats, easily. 
The zombies in the this movie's are so brutal and portrayed in such a unique way. It never gets boring. Not for a moment. (Some damn good pacing)
The acting from the entire ensemble is on point. Totally sold me on their performance.
There was some moments where the lead characters had to make some pretty difficult choices. That kinda thing always happens in a zombie film, but they dealt with it a fresh way and me care for these characters even more.
The best thing about the movie's the hordes and hordes of zombies! And when talking about a zombie movie, it feels so refreshing to say that. (I wonder how many extras it took to get that many zombies)<br/><br/>I also want to mention something which is so important to me in a horror movie: Subtlety.
There were scenes where zombies or the infected would just hang around in the back of the screen, sometimes not even in focus and the camera would just glance over it. That makes it so much more real and scary. <br/><br/>It's nail biting from start to finish and completely worth your time. Go for it!
And just when I thought this genre had finally gone stale...
Train to Busan is currently Korea's 9th top grossing domestic movie of all time and I can definitely see why!
What a movie."

"Parks","6","1","5","4 February 2017"," Action-Packed Zombies - Heavy-Handed Storyline
","There are good and bad things about ""Train to Busan"". It's a claustrophobic zombie movie that makes the most of having its protagonists trapped on a speeding train with a horde of ravenous zombies.<br/><br/>It doesn't milk that situation of being trapped quite as effectively as ""REC"" but the action sequences are spectacular and the zombie attacks are very well-staged.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have praised the social satire element of the film. Hmm... I found it might have worked better if it were not laid on with a trowel. The ""douche"" fund-manager, the evil executive who just NEVER MISSES an opportunity to screw someone over. I found it painfully sentimental at times and ""Yes, I get it"" obvious at others.<br/><br/>At this moment in history, when the rich and powerful are turning us against each other in order to further their own interests we do need films with messages like this. And on the whole I enjoyed ""Train to Busan"" more than I didn't. But if there is to be remake, I do hope the film-makers allow for a little more subtlety in there."

"Re-view","8","1","6","19 August 2019"," One of the best zombie / horro flicks out there
","*** This is a fair and even handed review - I'm not one of these idiots that marks either 1 or 10 for every film they watch because they don't understand the context ***<br/><br/>Even if ""Train to Busan"" was ""just another zombie film"", it's one of the best out there. Ranking with the originality of Romero's Dead series, through to the panic of ""28 days"" and ""28 weeks later"", and the scale of ""World War Z"". It's a great ""monster in the house"" set up, the house being a train and the surrounding cities and stations - and the monsters, some form of fast infected sprinting zombies, that stop at nothing to prey on the living. It's worth watching just for the sheer carriage to carriage excitement, and the jerking and twisting Zombies as they awaken, along with a fresh take on their abilities.<br/><br/>But at heart, it's a beautiful story of a fathers relationship with his daughter, and the sacrifice parents make to keep their children happy and offer them the best in life. It's filled with plenty of additional memorable characters that you form a strong bond with: love, understand, or hate - and plenty in between. It's definitely got a Korean / Manga feel. From the dread of the opening scene, the poignant score, to the special effects, and pacing - it's a great film on it's own, and even better within the genre - which has certainly been hard to do these last 20 years.<br/><br/>It's an action packed and emotional roller coaster from start to finish, with plenty of jumping moments and even some tear jerkers!<br/><br/>If you're a zombie fan, it's a must see, and almost everyone else will enjoy it too.<br/><br/>8/10"

"melis-aleyna","9","1","6","23 September 2018"," Great movie
","There was not one minute I didn't enjoyed watching this movie. The writers did not waste a second on this. From beginning to ending the plot was very well packed with climax after climax.<br/><br/>The movie started off a bit clichÃ¨ with a single divorced parent and a daughter he cannot spend enough time with because of his work and busy schedule. It's a very good plot to see their relationship develop through the movie though. Which by the way was a success.<br/><br/>The important part of this movie which makes it so unique is the fact that this movie does not, ironically, focus on the zombies. Their origin, cure, strength is not the main focus and will not be explained. What the movie actually represents (and this is my own interpretation) is the interaction within a group of people (representing a society). This movie shows how people react to a 'threat' emotionally, morally and by action. Zombies are just supposed to represent a threat in this movie but still be a tool to make it an action-packed horror movie on the way.<br/><br/>Most of the movie take place in a train and creates an original and claustrophobic atmosphere for a zombie movie. The story was pretty close to a real life experience with no really weapons involved or ordinary humans who turn out to know everything about the zombies and fight them as if it was originally their job. Their were a few minor things in the movie that didn't seem to make much sense though.<br/><br/>The main character was not that likable in the beginning. Towards the end he started to grow on me. His daughter, thank god, did not turn out to be a clingy annoying daughter. She was suspiciously calm during the whole process of surviving. The husband of the pregnant women was probably my favorit character as for the baseball boy who was quite likable as well. Very colorful characters. The villain a little exaggerated in my opinion but acceptable if you think about the fact that he is supposed to represent the ignorant part of todays society.<br/><br/>I spent two hours on a great zombie movie and would recommend it to everybody."
"c-kelsall","7","1","6","31 August 2018"," Zombies on a train
","First we had snakes on a plane, now Korean zombies on a train. Awesome.
Korean cinema is a curious beast; I love the films of Park Chan-Wook, but other contributors have a tendency to get a bit mawkish and oversentimental as the drama unfolds, and I'm afraid that what was otherwise a beautifully paced and entertaining ZOMBIE film ended up this way. I'm all for character development, and being made to care a bit who lives and who dies, but....IT'S A ZOMBIE FILM! It starts out tongue-in-cheek, with some genuinely squirmy horror vibes, and I think it would've been best if it managed that balance throughout, but it lost its way tonally a bit in the last 20 minutes.
Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of it, and it will linger in my memory of top zombie films."
"reshmurray","10","2","19","26 November 2019"," Great Movie- some bad in these reviews
","I watched this movie at 2am and was hooked, found myself holding my breath, cheering on characters, angry at some and overall enthralled. Its not a perfect movie by no stretch of the imagination. There were times when the tunnels were supposed to be 2 minutes long but end up being 10 minutes in reality. Nevertheless, the cast chemistry and overall acting was superb! I always feel like all zombie movies seem the same but this one had funny moments, loving moments and very sad moments.<br/><br/>Now for the comments on the female characters. I see some people commenting on the legs, breast, thighs and other parts of the cheerleader like she is some object and thats just repulsive. Some others felt the need to point out the the pregnant character was ""ok"" as if that was more to turn off the male viewers rather than a major plot of the story. Showing us how fathers do sacrifice so much and sometimes get very little praise. He gave his life up in the movie for his pregnant wife and baby who he has not even met. I rarely leave a review but this is the first I have done so and also the first I have seen a female character commented on like a piece of meat."

","I wasn't feeling this movie and made it about 30 mins in before I had to stop, but not for the same reasons as a lot of other negative reviewers, which seem to take issue w/ the zombies' abilities themselves, that's not the issue. The behavior of the characters is so odd and unbelievable I couldn't suspend my disbelief. I'll give you some examples.<br/><br/>1) The young daughter of the main character walks into a small train cabin to use the bathroom while train employees are dealing w/ a clearly deranged and potentially dangerous man in that very bathroom. Instead of telling her to leave they just let her stand...LITERALLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM, while this man mumbles about how everyone's going to die. First red flag.<br/><br/>2) When the zombies start attacking most people seem to just stand around like idiots waiting for their death. It was actually kinda funny to see...<br/><br/>3) The main character gets a call from his mother and instead of immediately asking how she is and telling her to barricade the door, he just has a chat w/ her until he realizes she's already been bitten. So dumb.<br/><br/>4) Everyone is all around way too calm w/ their current situation.<br/><br/>Skip that one, unless you're like most people and have absolutely no standards lawl."

"PetarNeo","9","1","7","16 September 2016"," Kicked off brilliantly and then slowed down
","From thought about zombie movie you would remember World War Z or Walking Dead but now you have Train to Busan that is strong, powerful, dramatic and great. After introduction to main characters it almost immediately switched to dramatic and horrific zombie attack. As the train goes it all went down rapidly, with attacks and spreading of zombies through train it's pure horror and violence. Some of very impressive scenes were in the movie like one when zombies are chasing the train and grab it creating a long line of them holding onto it. There was also a character that was wisely put in the movie a perfectly used later at the end of it, as guy that seemed like homeless sacrificed his life for pregnant women and Soo- an. Movie also showed in some scenes it's dramatic aspect of it where sacrifices were made. There was also a couple of things that shouldn't be like that for instance CEO Yon-suk that acted selfish in couple scenes. Movie was overall great experience as it offers more than pure horror but also psychological aspect. 3.5/4"

Horde of zombies popped out of glasses or holes like cluster of insects, then may or may not piled up remind me of World War Z 3. Using tape as for arms protection remind of me The Walking Dead. 4. Pack of zombies knit/ bridge themselves to the train reminds me of World War Z, although it'snot wall. 5. The stupid villain live through nearly the end, some of his actions remind me of those few characters from Night of the Living Dead. 6.

","A farmer is stopped at some decontamination checkpoint. There's some leak at a biotech plant.<br/><br/>Next we meet the boss of some investment firm. He's of course too busy to pay attention to his young daughter who wants to visit her mom in Busan. The dad finally agrees and they make it to the train station. On they way there's something going on, lots of emergency vehicles are driving somewhere. As the train departs zombies attack the train station and one actually makes it on the train.<br/><br/>This zombie attacks some train attendant who bites another one and so on. Here the transformation into a zombie is near instantaneous. Depending on the needs of the script it may happen right away or it may take a minute or two. When eventually the passengers catch on what is going on, they run to the front of the train while the zombies end up in the rear. But by now the condition is spreading all over South Korea. The train isn't allowed to stop somewhere, communications are interrupted.<br/><br/>We meet several characters: a pregnant woman and her tougher husband, two older women, a young baseball team, an even more arrogant and selfish business guy, and the train conductor.<br/><br/>They do stop in some town where people would be quarantined by the military. But when they arrive and leave the train the military personnel is also infected. So it's back on the train but this time a group is in the back another in the rear. The ones in the back--our heroes--have to make it to the front where people are so freaked out they won't let them in.<br/><br/>Things get grimmer and we'll have to see who actually survives this disaster as they get closer and closer to Busan.<br/><br/>Train to Busan is a long, slow, melodramatic thriller with zombies piled up--I guess that's going to be the new trend thanks to World War Z, piles and piles of quick zombies. Despite the penchant for drama there's little dialogue and the characters' behavior often doesn't make a whole lot of sense mainly because for some reason they have nothing to say to each other. The zombie action is quick, somewhat unclear, individual zombies matter little but masses of zombies falling out of train cars like cockroaches are emphasized. None of it is particularly scary or frightening, which it should be given that the humans in a train have only two places to go- to the front or to the back. There's not a whole lot of gore or violence. What is good though is the setting of a zombie movie in a train; and I also liked that the movie takes place mostly during the day.<br/><br/>It's surprising that while this movie does point out the soullessness of business people it also makes one of them the hero. We do get some sense of Korean values--rigidity, deference to authority, overemphasis on education as a solution to all ills.<br/><br/>I can't quite understand the high score of this movie. It is perfectly mediocre and stands out in no way whatsoever."

It is exciting but also sad because you grow to know and to like most of the characters in the movie and you don't want them to fall into the hands of the zombies.<br/><br/>But by the end of the movie I felt not only sad but also burdened for some reason. I couldn't understand why because the movie itself was very well-made and enjoyable. And I wasn't bothered that the movie didn't end the way I wanted it to. No, it was something else.<br/><br/>And I thought about it and I think it has something to do with the filmmakers way of looking at things, of their way of understanding the world. I know it's a fictional story of course, but what kind of a world is it where the reward for the incredible acts of bravery and of self sacrifice that some of the characters in the movie go through is to turn them into unthinking, ultra-violent bloodthirsty monsters!<br/><br/>And then it occurred to me that it must have something to do with the filmmakers way of looking at things. It's a sad place indeed where your reward for incredible acts of bravery and of self-sacrifice is to become an ultra-violent unthinking monster.

"Cineanalyst","7","0","1","13 April 2020"," Zombies on a Train
","The action of ""Train to Busan"" is so intense and the set-up excellent that the movie's faults may almost be overlooked. Others have, rightly, compared the fighting aboard a train, moving through carnage from car to car, to ""Snowpiercer"" (2013), also by Korean filmmakers and also including a heavy-handed message on socio-economic inequality. The cinematic potential of trains, which partly came of age along with motion pictures at the end of the 19th century, was realized early on, though: as coinciding movement with the Lumière brothers' ""Arrival of a Train"" (1896), as framing movement with the phantom-ride views that displayed shifting scenery from the point of view of a moving train, and, with action as a third layer of momentum, as early as Edwin S. Porter's ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903). So, here, in ""Train to Busan,"" we have zombies instead of bandits. Zombies running down aisles after their fleshy prey, zombies seen outside shifting views from the windows, and zombies thrown into windows. Even the effects for their piling up when a large enough herd is in pursuit works well enough.<br/><br/>The father-child dynamic is effective, too. But, the prospect of the fund manager investing in a company maybe responsible for the outbreak adds nothing. And, as if it weren't enough for this ""bloodsucker,"" as another, lower-class character (played by Ma Dong-seok, the most charismatic actor of the bunch) calls him--such terminology putting him in league with the flesh-eating zombies, to learn his lesson, to treat people with respect and egalitarianism, an insufferably irredeemable baddie is introduced. This leads to a contrived class structure between the train doors that's ridiculously oblivious to the undead threat surrounding them. Plus, there are other melodramatic contrivances and repetitions in the characters' quest for survival. As a zombie action flick, however, ""Train to Busan"" is, indeed, a thrill ride, and the ending nicely threatens a reference to that first modern zombie film, ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968)."

","With so many hype by my friends and good reviews. I finally watched it after all these years because I can tell just by the trailer that it's a skip for me and I was right. Being Asian I've seen lots of Asian movies mostly Chinese and Korean. some of them are good and lots of them are cliche. This one is the cliche one.<br/><br/>From the start, the main character, divorced father and daughter has this off relationship and my first thought was one of them is gonna die and it's gonna so dramatic and wow they basically did that to all the couples. They have these pairs like father w/ daughter, dad w/ pregnant wife, two old sisters, this shy hs boy and the pretty girl. You can see where this's going. After they did that to the second couples I rolled my eye so hard at the third. Also The special effect is cringey.<br/><br/>Final thoughts. It was kinda fun as a zombie apocalypse movie. The story is predictable and characters are exist just to be killed off in a dramatic way. I usually like movies that make me cry but not like this. This one felt like they were trying too hard to squeeze tears out of your eyes."

"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","1 April 2020"," Exhilarating Day One zombie movie
","Train to Busan is a story about a group of random people that are on their way to Busan in South Korea when the zombie virus breaks loose and people start to turn. The movie is nothing more than their desperate struggle to survive through the initial onslaught and make it to safety. But it excels at just that, being nail-bitingly intense, legitimately scary and surprisingly touching on character level.<br/><br/>First of all, the zombies are great. Full of props to the actors and the special effects team for their work, because not only were these zombies scary on a conceptual level - turning in an instant and being blindingly fast and strong - but they were also played superbly and looked horrifying.<br/><br/>Secondly, the script is great. Day One zombie movies are often rather similar in their plots, and as such there's an art to doing it in a way that feels new and novel. And this movie certainly does that. I also really liked the characters and their interactions. Rarely have I cared as much about the survivors in a zombie film as I've cared about these people. Our nominal main characters, the father and daughter, and their character arcs were especially heart-wrenching.<br/><br/>Lastly, the directing. Yeon Sang-ho has a superb grasp on when to rush the plot along and when to give us a moment to breathe. It's an intense movie where there's always danger and something happening, but we still have these moments to get to know our characters and come to care about them. Or hate them, depending. The worst threats in a zombie apocalypse are often the other survivors, after all.<br/><br/>Fantastic film. One of the best zombie films I've seen in years. One of the best horror films in general, as well, for that matter. Recommended."

"squireaa","4","0","2","19 February 2020"," Extremely fun, not much else
","I went into this film thinking it was going to be extremely similar to one of my favorite anime, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. While the parallels are extremely easy to see, they are extremely different. No actual plot of this movie would I even consider mediocre. I think the dad and daughter relationship was set up fine, but I didn't feel any emotion in final scene. I just didn't really care, and obviously it's sad, but I just don't know enough about the characters to really feel emotion. There was one emotional part in the entire movie, that part being when the survivors are trying to get to safety after making their way through 4 cars, and Su-an was crying seeing people struggle to get the door open in front of her, and struggle to get the door closed behind her. That was easily the best scene of the entire movie, and the only part that went into anything deeper than a shallow zombie film. The other main plot, of the husband and his pregnant wife was fine, but nothing about it was really special. The dialogue of this film was definitely one of its weak points. There were huge long stretches of no dialogue when I think they could have really built up some of the characters in this time. It felt to me like this movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a fun action flick, or a deeper more emotional film. It tried to walk the line between both, and just did so very poorly. The worst of both were brought out. Overall I didn't hate this movie, but compared to other shows extremely similar, I would never recommend this over something like Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress."

"penguoxo","9","0","2","9 January 2020"," Not a typical zombie movie
","Wow, this movie is incredibly intense emotionally. The characters are all designed very well, so even if they seem like bad people at times or have done something wrong, you still are rooting for them because they have learned from their wrongs and are obviously being affected by them (except for one guy). It was surprising how real some of the movie felt, in terms of it not being the typical movie where everything predictably just barely goes perfectly for the main characters. This movie didn't sacrifice realism for plot convenience as much as some other movies which made it very tense and gripping. That said, there definitely were some times that they used plot convenience to set up to play with the audience's emotions, but it wasn't overdone. At times, the acting was kind of off, but I tried thinking about how they should have acted in those situations instead and couldn't think of how to execute what needed to be done. Some of the situations were just way too intense emotionally to really even know how someone would actually react in them. I enjoyed the music and camerawork as they both added to the movie quite a bit. I don't have much negative to say about this film, it was really well done and way better and more thought provoking than I anticipated.<br/><br/>As for symbolism, themes, morals, etc., I didn't expect a zombie movie to be very deep, but Train to Busan really does force you to consider things. The main theme is finding a balance between sacrificing your own best interest for the good of others and putting yourself first. When should you ignore others in need to save yourself? Should you ever? How much of yourself should you sacrifice to help others? These questions are constantly addressed throughout the movie. The entire zombie outbreak was started because of negligence of the well being of others. There is a conflict between the father and his daughter in the beginning that is caused by him not being there in her life because he is always busy with work. His work has even caused his wife to leave him. He was obviously doing it all for his daughter's future, but when is the sacrifice too much and how should it be balanced properly? He learns early on that his daughter thinks of others a lot and does what she can for them, whereas he thinks only of himself a lot of the time which she notices and dislikes. As the story goes on, you can see a noticeable change in his actions as he becomes more and more giving until eventually he has to make the ultimate sacrifice to save his daughter. Along the way, some of his actions have almost instant karma where he will decide to risk helping someone and then they end up saving him soon after or he doesn't take the risk and it causes some sort of conflict for him. There are many characters who made great sacrifices for others and I think he saw that and always took note and saw the result of the sacrifice which helped him change and do the same. There is also a character who is entirely greedy and even sacrifices other for himself and although he does make it pretty far, he ends up infected which is very telling of where that route will get you.<br/><br/>All in all, I believe that Train to Busan is a great film all around and is entirely worth watching, whether you want an emotional, gripping, or thought provoking experience."

","This is what I imagine what it might have been like in South Korea during the early days of the zombie outbreak seen in ""World War Z.""<br/><br/>The movie does a lot of things right, such as focusing on just a few main characters, keeping the story tight, and having a good mix of fast-paced action and down-times. Sure, its budget was super low compared to WWZ, but this did not in any way hamper the realism or the experience. If anything, I'm rather surprised by how well the movie was made with the money they had available.<br/><br/>In fact, it seems relatively very little CGI was used, even for the zombies, which actually makes the movie that much more believable and realistic.<br/><br/>With the exception of a few scenes, the acting was mostly superb. Many of the characters are completely believable, even in their frustratingly at times stupidity. The reality is that in times of crises, people behave differently, unexpectedly, and sometimes badly. But some also rise to the challenge. These behaviors are well represented in the movie.<br/><br/>The only thing that I found to be difficult to believe is that there weren't more zombies running around in Busan, a city with nearly 4 million people.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed WWZ, like I did, you'll definitely appreciate ""Busanhaeng."""

","Korean Zombies (think World War Z) on a train packed with passengers desperately trying to get to Busan. A decent supply of heroes and villains are whittled down in what provides a claustrophobic environment. The limitations of the train are often cleverly exploited with fewer contrived moments. Pace plays a massive role in the movie, that of the zombies and the train, this is balanced with elements of stealth and quiet. As with the best apocalyptic movies the reactions of those in peril and the challenges to social norms are well explored. The characters are earnest and sympathetic, if at times a bit one dimensional.
It does a hell of a lot with must have been a meagre budget, and there's plenty of fun to be had on this rollercoaster. The result may not be up there with the best (28 days/weeks later) but there's something undeniably cool about watching a foreign language action movie, so you can bracket this one with Nikita and The Raid. Not necessarily in terms of quality but in kudos earned. SEVEN"

","(ONE SLIGHT SPOILER)<br/><br/>Genre movies can get a rough critical ride - if a movie, film, book or whatever - hits all the expected beats and notes one might expect, it's easily dismissed. It's said to have done nothing meaningful, to be derivative. But as long as we've been telling stories, genres have been important - they provide comfort and a structure to tell a story that we feel safe with and understand.<br/><br/>Additionally, to dismiss genre art misses something very significant; many of humanity's greatest artists have worked within the strictures of the genre. Shakespeare is an example par excellence of this - most of his plays fit an established contemporary genre. What is exceptional in them is how he develops character and themes within these genres, whilst still pleasing those who came along for the comfort of the predictable (as well as the sublime language, of course).<br/><br/>South Korea action-horror movie Train To Busan is a genre movie with the highest of high concepts: zombies on a train. If that doesn't get a horror-action fan's juices flowing, then little will. It's stark and efficient; as characters board a train, a zombie outbreak (the word is only used once in the film) hits the world outside and inside the train. The action sequences are visceral and thrilling; making full use of the train's geography, and the rare sequences outside the train work equally effectively without disrupting the claustrophobic, trapped tone.<br/><br/>For the genre fan looking further, there's more to see. An incisive, satirically edged, take on the walls, customs and strictures we put around each other and others to protect our standing in families and societies.<br/><br/>(slight spoiler)<br/><br/>The fatal flaw of this zombie outbreak is that the zombies can only hunt what they can see. This means a couple of things - it adds some great wrinkles to action sequences when the train unpredictably enters or emerges from a tunnel, for example. But this idea also plays up the themes of the film, especially in the well-timed lull in advance of the film's final act as these ideas are given more space to breathe than in other similar films.<br/><br/>A key plot moment in the last twenty minutes tries to present some redemption and hope; I'm not convinced it works tonally or plot-wise; the ultimate conclusion a necessary upbeat that unsurprisingly allows a sequel should box office permit (it did - a sequel is in production).<br/><br/>It's not a perfect film, but this first live-action movie from the director promises much to watch with interest in years to come."
"Exiled_Universe","8","0","1","14 June 2019"," BEST EMOTIONAL ZOMBIE DISASTER ACTION FILM EVER MADE!!!!!!
","Alright, so the only reason i didnt give this a 9 or 10 is because it needs a lot of action and violence for that but now for the review. This movie was clearly the best zombie disaster film ever made and the movie captures that and shows that very well. The only problem i have is that its not in English but in the end i dont really care and its not really about that. The ending is the real best part, it is very emotional and you are guaranteed to at least start to cry because i did. The zombie scenes in this movie are scary and super cool especially the first sighting of the zombies, omg you have to see this. This is like a whole new experience of scary. horror, and disaster. If this was rated r and had more gore and was in English then it would most likely be a 9 or a 10 but actually i think its better without it because it feels more sad and more realistic to the viewer. This movie is like a masterpiece in the end and there probably not another movie like this one. You have to see this movie. And the beginning was cool with the whole deer thing and that might be what cause the disease with something on the truck with the deer idk. Great movie overall and when i was watching this movie i didnt want it to end because of how good it was. A very good emotional disaster film."

","Busanhaeng, more commonly known in the west as Train to Busan, focuses primarily on a hard-working man who frequently puts his work before his young daughter. The man, Seok-woo, takes his daughter on an early train headed from Seoul to Busan in order for her to see her mother. What happens when they board the train, well it is quite obvious what happens. Nevertheless, Train to Busan involved a broad range of characters, although they were cliche, that offered an experience of how people reacted to their surroundings and what they were willing to do in order to survive. There is relief and heartbreak along the way, but Train to Busan is certainly the best modern zombie film, and one of the best films I have recently seen. Train to Busan 2 is supposedly in the works for a 2020 release, and I cannot wait to see how the journey continues and what is next for our cast."
"j-85409","7","0","4","3 June 2019"," The train to Busan
","The Train to Busan is a thrilling horror unlike any I have seen before. Director Sang-ho Yeon puts his own spin on a large scale zombie outbreak, after a chemical lab releases a deadly virus. Unsuspecting passengers board a train that will cause them to see much more than the little girls mother. Innocent passengers must endure the seemingly never-ending train ride to Busan as they watch the cities of Korea fall around them, after a plant known for making mistakes releases the airborne virus. Although it as an apocalyptic style zombie fight-for-survival type movie, I wouldn't put it in the same category as some of the other prominent titles in the genre such as I Am Legend, or even World War Z.<br/><br/>Sang-ho Yeon added a new twist and stayed away from the typical 'tough guy gunning down zombies to save the world' approach of many similar movies, and focused on capturing the chaos happening during an apocalypse in the dense modern urban setting of South Korea. The characters consistently keep the audience on the edge of their seat because of the deeper emotional connection we are able to establish at the beginning by being able to relate to them. Because the language utilized in this movie is Korean it allowed me to focus more on character's emotions and facial expressions; this, however, does not take away from the film in my opinion. One of the key strengths of this film is the breathtaking camera work and shot choice, that helps engage the audience on a new level as we are immersed into their world. A large range of film techniques are used in this film and the utilization of subjective point of view shots greatly add to the already immersive film. South Korea being the setting of the film gives the audience an inquisitive urge to keep watching as each turn and bend is foreign to us. The director's definitive choice of setting for each shot aids the suspense and ""on your toes"" feeling for the duration of the movie. Unlike many of the other apocalyptic movies many of us have seen, the acting in this film is absolutely phenomenal. Going into this movie I had very low expectations for quality of acting, especially since I did not recognize any of the cast from previous movies. Each actor elegantly played their roles and spared no emotion. This blew me away as most other movies I've seen like this have focused on making a few characters look badass as they power their way through crowds of zombies, but this movie was different. Each character felt real and as the audience we really connect with them, feeling like we would have made the same choices.<br/><br/>A combination of intricate detailed set pieces, carefully chosen shots, and remarkable acting took this seemingly average zombie apocalyptic movie, to an invigorating emotionally engaging thriller that contracted my attention throughout. Not once did I feel like checking my phone or going to the bathroom, as this movie had me completely immersed from the opening scene to the the final credits."

","Needed to set up an account so I could write a review that focused on the movie, instead of some creepy ass review of the attractiveness of the women in the movie. Seriously, get it together dudes.<br/><br/>The first 10-15 minutes on the train build tension perfectly. So many little, freaky puzzle pieces that come together at just the right time and then never. Ever. Stop.<br/><br/>I liked this take on zombie lore. It's claustrophobic. It gives enough character development so that it's not just blood and gore. But it definitely has a good amount of blood and gore, if that's your thing. I've now watched this movie a second time and the suspense and tension still holds up."

"salsabilamaf","9","0","2","12 May 2019"," IT'S INTERESTING!! LET'S WATCH IT
","Actually, at first I'm not really interesting about this movie. Almost all of my friends talk about this movie a lot. Although a little bit late, finally i had watched this movie and i like it so much.
This is a Korean movie which about zombies attack in the train. The story is amazing and I as a viewer can't guess anything during I watch it. During watching this movie I also can feel the emotions felt by the actors and actresses. That fear, worry, and disgust when I see the zombie.
And I think, this movie is not just about a zombie movie. There's a implied message that tells us about humanity. How to be kind each other even though you don't know that person. How to helping each other in urgent circumstances. And how not to think just about yourself.
I am also surprised that I had cried when I saw one of the scene I feel really touched my heart. It teach that love between a children and their parents is truly pure. Although sometimes their actions show otherwise, but that is only to cover up their pride.
I just want to say, I RECOMENDED THIS MOVIE!! So don't you dare, you're not watch this movie hahaha"

","This movie is just a fantastic ride. Literally. Well not for them. The nearly non-stop train reflects the non-stop fight for survival. Even after so many zombie movies have been and gone, it's great that we still get new 'versions' and new environments to experience them in. There's some great ""oh god, get OUT of there quick!"" moments that are so much fun. I love my zombies, and this didn't disappoint!"

","Train to Busan (Busanhaeng) is a South Korean survivalist zombie movie.<br/><br/>It owes more to the Hollywood disaster movies on the 1970s such as The Poseidon Adventure or the Airport films.<br/><br/>Seok-woo is a divorced fund manager. A workaholic who never has much time for his young daughter Su-an. They board a train so she can visit her mother. An injured young woman scrambles onto the train before it leaves Seoul. She had been bitten and becomes infected by some type of virus that turns her into a flesh eating zombie.<br/><br/>As she bites others, they too become infected and in turn attack other passengers and staff. Some of the survivors try to move quickly to the safe carriages.<br/><br/>Survivors include Seok-woo and his daughter, a pregnant woman and her macho husband, two elderly sisters, members of a high school baseball team, a selfish tycoon and a few others. As the train journey continues, they get picked off one by one.<br/><br/>The zombies have been inspired by World War Z as at times they can be fast moving. The director has done well in maintaining tension and a claustrophobic atmosphere before moving the action to other places.<br/><br/>The characters are nicely fleshed out and this is one of the better zombie movies."

"imseeg","7","0","1","17 February 2019"," Has the look and feel of a B movie, but this zombie movie turns out to be a rather good one. Great frenzy and gore. Riveting suspense and unnerving fight for survival.
","Didnt expect much of it at first. Looked like a cheap B movie, because of the low budget for special effects. But that low budget for special effects turns out to be a good thing, because what we get instead of boring CGI effects is great real life mass pursuits of zombies. And instead of boring CGI we get a lot of real life unnerving close up fights for survival with zombies in a high speed train.<br/><br/>Yes, the bloody zombies dont look particularly convincing, but their frenzy is terrific nonetheless. Yes, for those nitpickers who complain about apparent loopholes in the story, there are indeed some, but they dont affect the movie's suspense. The actors arent particularly great either, but their characters are quite convincing nonetheless.<br/><br/>Despite all these minor let downs I got really swept away with this suspenseful story about a korean dad, who wants to protect his young daughter from zombie attacks on a train. The ""zombies on a train"" theme is rather interesting as well. All in all a really surprising, enjoyable and even emotionally touching zombie movie. 7 stars, but I will upgrade to 8 stars if this movie still stands strong after a second viewing."
"CountJonnie","6","0","1","17 February 2019"," Collision course with zombies.....and emotions
","Train to Busan is a decent zombie movie that focusses less on horror/gore, and more on people and emotions. Without a real intro, the watcher is thrown in the middle of the movie, already overrun by zombies, while a group of survivors try to escape by train. But the horrors continu on the train, as it seems that zombies are not the only monsters.<br/><br/>The effectiveness of this movie is thanks to the great actors who portray the spastic and quick zombies, without relying on gore. Another effect is the amazing acting by father and daughter, pregnant woman and boyfriend, and the ""evil"" rich man who doesn't care about others. The movie obviously focusses on humanity, choises and effects.<br/><br/>That's also the flaw of the movie. After a while it becomes repetitive and the roles become cliche. The ""evil"" rich man becomes a cliche to a point that it becomes caricatural. This doesn't bring the movie down, because the pacing is so fast, that you'll never get bored or stuck in a situation. Train to Busan is still one of the better zombie movies in years."
"nairtejas","6","0","2","24 November 2018"," Molecule Review: Train to Busan (6 Stars)
","Just like any other zombie film, Sang-ho Yeon's Train to Busan starts and ends like you would expect it to be unless you deep dive into the dialogues between the characters that create a much more emotional impact on you. There's a biomedical threat engulfing the city of Seoul and its neighboring areas when a selfish fund manager has to take his daughter to her mom (they are separated) in Busan. But they don't know what's coming to hunt them. How these two characters plus a bunch of other ones try to save themselves from the impulsive zombies forms the crux of this horror thriller that has some insane CGI work to keep you hooked. I watched the Hindi dubbed version (with English subtitles), so naturally the effect was a bit low if you are not a Korean native. But I found Train to Busan to be an emotional drama about relationships and their absence more than it is about a zombie apocalypse. You have to decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing. TN."

","Listen, do yourself a favor and get the EXPRESS PASS on this one.<br/><br/>Train to Busan was insanely too long...I live for zombie movies, but this one was putting me to sleep after about an hour. I went and made some tea 🍵, seriously.<br/><br/>No real story line here...yeah, zombies, still needs a decent storyline, IMO. The characters are all pretty ridiculous, most notably the Korean, Smash Mouth, ICP, Guy Fieri - looking dude with the pregnant wife.<br/><br/>Decent enough acting, pacing, violence, special FX, weird zombie seizures, and plenty of blood.<br/><br/>I think they just tried to pack too much in, with a whole lot of nothing going on, on such a short train ride.

","This movie was literally a Korean Version of World War Z because of it's action. Unlike going across the world to find a origin of the virus this is more of surviving on a train with a bunch of characters that you can actually remember unlike some movies where they introduce the character but don't go as much in-depth. I also liked how they somewhat had a basis on what happened.
What I didn't like were the first 15 minutes. When the man ran over the deer and the deer got reanimated I never understood it's purpose rather than the zombies are rising. I never understood much also of the main character's business and work, maybe if they added 5 minutes somewhere in the beginning of him talking more to his Mother it would've added more sentimental value."

There is no need for it.<br/><br/>Great SFX nevertheless.<br/><br/>(ATM I have 500+ ratings but this is my first review, mostly because I am a bit annoyed at this movie and the overrated user reviews)."
"pipecax","6","0","4","22 January 2017"," One of The Most Sound Inspections Inside Horror Sub-Genre
","Current walkers' genre arises from horror/survival films chiefly, which located its golden years at the end of the 1960s, where the sub- genre genesis was cemented with a brand new and unique solvency, the same one that slaughters the audience as genuine vultures without any substance. Although there's not an accurate date about when it was considered preeminent in the celluloid world, but we do know the three men who reflected heterogeneity and universal depth that an undead horde may originate. The first man was who took the chance to emit an uncommon conception at that time, where demise was not the conclusion in the lifeline, but one cycle more for transfiguring itself into testimonial detriment. George A. Romero, he was who opened the pathway with a must-see crowning work, essential for anyone who is adept to the heterodox category. A few years later, Danny Boyle built a task titivated with ingredients with which we were already getting familiar, however, they were endowed its work with collective and psychological idiosyncrasy; the above made us apprehended the same nature viewed from an opposed and eccentric perspective. And finally, three years ago moderately, Marc Forster propelled zombie theme to extremist and utter crippling visual dimensions —it's so like Hollywood, — nevertheless, he also managed to impregnate it a relevant dramatic connotation. It is, in fact, a shame that among hundreds of projects which are both crowded together on the small screen as on the big screen, only these three cases truly get to be more than an ephemeral film; a film with justifications, rudiments, soul and laconic structure.<br/><br/>Yeon Sang-ho's ""Train to Busan"" or ""Busanhaeng"" (original title), glorified formidably by key contests in the issue, exposes and pours strategically concerning and globally significant thesis into a top- level artistic and choreographic majesty, nonetheless, the movie expressed neither something substantially divergent nor fresh in cinematic terms, what categorizes it as an entertaining, effective and somewhat nugatory film. Cannes and Sitges opened the doors to the director, newcomer in live-action movies—since his previous works have been clearly animated, among them is the initial part of this story, ""Seoul Station"", screened at BIFFF, serves as outbreak and exordium within this atmosphere, — to testify his assiduity and supremacy in this classification; These festivals intensified significantly commercial splendor through Word-of-mouth marketing (WOMM) around the film, drawing more than 11 million in attendance just in Korea.<br/><br/>In essence, the storyline takes place inside of a train which departs from Seoul; place in where an opportunist and self-centered father is constricted by his daughter to buy two tickets for a prolonged travel in the carriages; she longs vehemently for visiting her mother in Busan, South Korea's second most-populous city and in where this public transport has delimited its arrival.The quandary is that in the morning, an abnormal virulence, stirred up by main character's biochemical corporation, charges against Korean residents of an intense and enraged way, originating a hair-raising maelstrom territorial.While they thought that in comfort of their train indemnity was infallible, one infected sneaks in the rear coach inducing an out-of-control derangement; the only hope for passengers is to arrive as soon as possible to Busan, site where a hypothetical military shelter sits, however, the walkers are not the worst catastrophe, human begins' apocalypse and corruption is it.<br/><br/>The film is closely influenced by two antithesis managed of clever way at least mostly: in the first place, narrative proposal is fully foreign along with comic and western popular culture references; and in the second place, characters are significantly oriental, which connect with other factors correctly, among them stand out superb mise-en-scène—which no longer has any reason to ""envy"" American cinematic mecca, —an impetuous soundtrack supplying exuberance, a relevant dramatic talent and a final act that derails its film and plot ambitions beyond its own limits, to a certain point.<br/><br/>The huge and mundane obstacle is it adjusts and stretches on genre clichés, providing entertainment without offering something little know, equally, the slow-pace beginning and over-the-top sensitive moments reduce the fantastic results from the first 45 minutes.<br/><br/>Once again, it argues unexplored—or at least, unseen— aptitude of oriental cinema. ""Train to Busan"" is a well-made rail travel with zombie thematic which subverts in its narrative threads individualism, disparate social conditions, selfishness and lack of concern for the welfare of the other, issues punching our contemporary society every morning. ""Busanhaeng"" represents all what a roamer film lover aspires to see, however, manipulates the used components with one different hand, creating a splendid visual beauty to generate such feeling. Refreshing, captivating and even entertaining; the film is as frantic and direct as the same train."
