","The first 45 minutes are basically Murphy's law for the protagonist: everything that can go wrong, will go wrong. But you it's also true that when you've hit rock bottom, the only way is up. What follows still isn't predictable here, but takes a lot of effort, sweat and tears. Once the film is over, you realize it played you with the conventions of the sports drama you've seen a few times before. But while you're in it, you're on the edge of the seat and feel for this deeply flawed man and his adorable daughter. That's no small feat. Director Fuqua could rely on an incredibly strong cast, especially Gyllenhaal, delivering one of the best performances of his career."
"shawneofthedead","7","168","204","17 July 2015"," Formulaic but entertaining, in its own way, with an excellent cast doing excellent work.
","There's got to be something magical at work here. Strictly speaking, there isn't a shred of anything remotely original in Southpaw's DNA. Boil the narrative down to its bare bones, and it's a tried-and-tested, tried-and-tired retread of the sports movie. It's not even metaphorically about getting back up after life knocks you down - that's literally the plot of the film. And yet, through Antoine Fuqua's sensitive direction, Kurt Sutter's punchy dialogue and some excellent performances, Southpaw somehow transcends its own generic limitations.<br/><br/>We meet the scrappy Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) at the height of his career as a boxer. He's the undefeated champion of the world in his category, and after each match, he gets to drag his broken, bruised body home to his doting wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) and adorable daughter Leila (Oona Laurence). It's a far better life than a kid born and raised on the streets could have hoped for. But, one terrible day, tragedy strikes. Practically overnight, Billy loses everything: his career, his lifestyle, and his family. Trapped by grief, depression and his grim circumstances, Billy must fight hard to get back on his feet and recover what he can of his old life.<br/><br/>From an objective standpoint, Southpaw is almost breathtakingly old- fashioned and unoriginal. You've definitely seen it all before - arrogant athlete suffers an ignominious setback, and must gain some humility and a better understanding of the more important things in life before he can complete his journey towards redemption. Sutter's script seems to almost thrive on its many clichés. He saddles his protagonist with the weighty and completely unsubtle surname of Hope. When all seems bleak, Billy's scheming agent Jordan Mains (Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson) deserts him for his chief rival. Billy acquires a gruff but trustworthy mentor in the form of Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker). The film has even forgotten to explain - or take into account - its title, which refers to a stance adopted by left- handed boxers in the ring.<br/><br/>And yet, for all its flaws, Southpaw is a compelling, touching and surprisingly truthful effort. Fuqua tackles the predictable elements of the story with such verve and sensitivity that he manages to make them more palatable. The director unearths the gnawing heartbreak in Billy's anguish, as he visits a daughter who has grown cold and unresponsive towards him. The relationship that develops between Billy and Tick has its obligatory share of training montages, but also features moments of genuine connection between the two men, as they drink, mourn and bond with each other.<br/><br/>Though it never becomes what you might call a classic, Southpaw occasionally flirts with greatness. That's due almost entirely to its cast. McAdams channels her trademark sunshine and charm into a relatively thankless supporting role. Her energy and chemistry with Gyllenhaal add invaluable weight to the emotional stakes in the film, lingering long after each of her scenes with her on-screen husband. Whitaker, who could play his part in his sleep, thankfully doesn't do so. Instead, he's very present, suggesting a darker inner life to his character that's fascinating to watch. Laurence, meanwhile, is a great find. She plays every aspect of Leila - her innocence and vulnerability, as well as her resentment and steely determination - with a piercing, heartbreaking truthfulness.<br/><br/>The main draw, however, is Gyllenhaal, and for very good reason. Frankly, no one would have expected him to take the part of Billy Hope, which had originally been designed with rapper Eminem in mind. And yet, Gyllenhaal once again proves with Southpaw, as he has done with his consistently bold and off-kilter career choices, that he might very well be the finest actor of his generation. In a complete turnaround from his skeletal look in last year's Nightcrawler, he's practically unrecognisable as the beefed-up, mumbly Billy, burying his own slim frame and fine bone structure beneath layers of weight and muscle. Beyond the physical transformation, however, are Billy's darker demons. It's here where Gyllenhaal excels, as Billy taps into, releases and, ultimately, learns to temper the almost blinding rage that both drives and traps him.<br/><br/>Truth be told, there are better movies out there about boxing and/or redemption. This isn't Rocky, much less Raging Bull. But, somehow, Southpaw pulls off that weird, difficult trick of being predictable but compelling at the same time. The ending may never be in doubt, but there's a certain pleasure to be derived from the journey. If all else fails, watch this for Gyllenhaal, who's currently doing some of the best, most vital work of his career."
"JoaoPovoaMarinheiro","8","53","61","3 October 2015"," Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is a southpaw that goes straight to the heart
","We can always criticize Hollywood for bringing movies that are intended to toss some smoke to the viewer by presenting something new with repeated formulas and recycled plots we have seen somewhere else before. The same goes for ""Southpaw""... apart from the fact that there's something more lying inside this story about a boxer's redemption. The answer to it is the trust it puts into the strength of its actors and the gripping emotions that come with it.<br/><br/>There's a little sparkle that starts to light up inside of us during the very first minutes of the movie. And even if we barely have the time to see Gyllenhaal and McAdams' characters, we didn't need more because we were instantly dragged towards an emotional charge that never abandons the plot and whose ""legacy"" is carried on the main actor's shoulders.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal doesn't skip a beat and keeps his character's pain and rage constantly vivid in every detail - we feel it because we've somewhat experienced in our lives what it means to lose someone we love and feel lost afterward. We felt the struggle coming after the loss of a bond as strong as that one. That's why his performance is relentless and immaculate.<br/><br/>Truth is that the genuine side of ""Southpaw""'s plot is based on the main character's fall and his irreproachable route to stand up again, reach the top once more. Only this time, the fight has completely changed and the goals are different, goals that make us question what we really fight for in our life.<br/><br/>You already know this story but not told under these terms. Hollywood has crafted good flicks about fighters/boxers in the last few years and ""Southpaw"" follows a line that is close to the more recent ""Warrior"", starring Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy due to its ""underdog"" screenplay. What makes this movie different from the rest is the ineluctable emotion that never departs and befalls us, stirring and stirring our inner feelings.<br/><br/>We don't always need to criticize a movie for its predictability. ""Southpaw"" is predictable but it's also honest in assuming itself as such because its purpose - and I believe, Antoine Fuqua's purpose - is to divert our attention towards something more meaningful. And when a movie pierces the bone to reach our heart and soul with this impact, then it deserves our respect and acknowledgment.<br/><br/>""Southpaw"" is, quite simply, liberating."
"jespor","8","20","22","31 May 2019"," Jake Gyllenhaal deserves at least a nomination
","Wow. This is actually an incredible movie in which Gyllenhaal delivers an Oscar worthy performance.<br/><br/>It's kind of an emotional rollercoaster which gives you the best of the two different worlds in boxing and drama. A comeback story at its finest. The father-daughter relationship gets me the most.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie more times than I can count and it still amazes me that Jake Gyllenhaal didn't even got nominated for this one - he is outstanding!"
"condillon","Null","102","131","24 July 2015"," Coming from a formulaic genre, Southpaw is a bit cliché but it surely brings powerful performances and a promising storyline
","Southpaw follows Billy ""The Great"" Hope, the reigning junior middleweight boxing champion, having an impressive career, a loving wife and daughter, and a lavish lifestyle. However, when tragedy strikes, Billy hits rock bottom, losing his family, house and manager. He soon finds an unlikely savior in Tick Willis, a former fighter who trains the city's toughest boxers. With his future on the line, Hope fights to reclaim the trust of those he loves the most.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua has most certainly brought his charm back into the ring by bringing a fascinating boxing drama to the big screen. Even though it may have a all to familiar plot when it comes to the formulaic boxing aspect, this film really smooths out well with such heavenly storytelling, we are given a accurate accusation of how something can affect someone in the hardest way possible.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal giving a ferocious performance as a down on his luck boxer was truly a grand experience. He really stuck to his character by bringing such a mad man to the ring and a man who would strive to make his family a whole once again, one wondrous performance I must say. One person other than Jake that really stood out was Forest Whitaker, he easily gave one of the best performances of this year so far!<br/><br/>The boxing scenes were so enthralling, they involved such wall-to-wall burst of punches with spraying blood and Fuqua's gutsy camera skills that keep you motived the whole time. Jake snorting like a mad bull, he surely brought out the horns to each opponent with a raging force, these scenes were just so highly entertaining that they made your heart pumping with such adrenaline. <br/><br/>I was not bored at all with Southpaw, I was invested the whole time. Even with its clichés, the film surely beats them down with mighty performances by its lead and supporting cast and cosmic storytelling. The drama was foretold fluently with a good take at how a family can fall apart and reconnect in such a turn of events, I loved that, it flowed along so ideally with a strong tone. In the end, SP is surely a spellbinding film towards a strong man that doesn't get knocked down by what life has to swing at him!"

"3xHCCH","8","98","135","23 July 2015"," Gyllenhaal the Great
","Billy Hope is the light heavyweight champion of the world with a 43-0 record. One day, as a result of his uncontrollable violent temper, tragedy after tragedy hits him and his family until he is left with nothing -- not his fortune, not his career, not his family. Despondent and desperate to get his life back, Billy swallows his pride and seeks the assistance of trainer Tick Wills to train him back to fighting form.<br/><br/>""Southpaw"" is an acting showcase for its lead actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Last year in the film ""Nightcrawler"", Gyllenhaal gave us all the creeps with his very realistic portrayal of sociopathic pseudo-video journalist Louis Bloom. He was overlooked at the Oscars of the Best Actor nomination he clearly deserved. With this meaty role, Gyllenhaal set out to prove that that his transformative performance last year was not a fluke at all.<br/><br/>His performance here as Billy Hope is another triumph of his very serious and committed method acting style. Here, Gyllenhaal again undergoes a total physical transformation into a grizzled prizefighter with a buff hardened physique, scarred face and swollen eye. We feel every ache of his weary body as he shuffles in his gait. His speech is already slurred with probable nerve damage. We see and sense the ravages of his vicious sport on him.<br/><br/>He captured the character of an impulsive man who was not too savvy in life, and easily driven to violently angry tendencies. As Billy's world collapses around him, Gyllenhaal brings us all down to his hell with him. We totally see the unraveling of a man until a mere shadow of him remained. Then we would witness how he humbles himself as he tries to bring the shattered pieces of his life back together again. This was in addition to all the pounding he had in the boxing ring itself. This was truly an acting tour de force by Gyllenhaal which simply cannot be ignored.<br/><br/>The actors in supporting roles all share in Gyllenhaal's shine. Despite her name being so prominent in the poster, Rachel McAdams appeared on screen only for a very short time. In that limited time, we clearly see the effect of her strong character Maureen on her husband Billy. Bespectacled little Oona Laurence plays their spirited daughter Leila. Gyllenhaal and Laurence share some pretty intensely emotional scenes together.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker plays Tick Wills, the tough disciplinarian of a trainer whom Billy chose to bring him back on track. I thought it was clever how they even include Whitaker's left eye into the story. Curtis ""50 Cent"" Smith plays Billy's fair-weather manager Jordan Mains. He really has this sleazy vibe about him with his flashy smile and shiny suits.<br/><br/>Director Antoine Fuqua effectively wrung all the right emotions out of this story. The storytelling is well-paced and the camera work is compelling. The fight scenes were well-choreographed and executed on screen -- very brutal, bloody, all with high tension. The first person point of view during the fights puts you right in the midst of all the action.<br/><br/>The musical score contributes so much to the drama of this film. This is also the last film James Horner scored before his untimely demise in a plane crash recently. We also hear Eminem rap in the soundtrack. It is interesting to note that Eminem was actually the original choice to play Billy Hope.<br/><br/>Boxing is a common sport tackled in movies because of its inherent drama. ""Rocky"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""The Fighter"" easily come to mind as among the best of them ever made. This is why we may feel we have seen this story In ""Southpaw"" told in another way before. However, the grippingly honest acting of Jake Gyllenhaal definitely set this film apart from others. He made ""Southpaw"" a most extraordinary boxing film to watch. 8/10."
"DrZom-77-388656","5","155","225","29 August 2015"," You have seen this movie before
","I guess there is just no new way of telling this story. A boxer on top of his world loses everything in the blink of an eye, then battles his way back. Every trite plot wrinkle is there. Every sympathy trigger is there. The writing is not bad. The story is as well told as it can be, but the story just does not need to be told again. <br/><br/>Jake was great. His transformation from the pale, ghoulish ""Nightcrawler"" to a ripped pro boxer is startling. His portrayal of the punchy, brutal fighter on a journey of redemption is every bit as good as one could expect. Top marks for Jake. And the boxing scenes are as bloody as you could ask.<br/><br/>So there are some good things in a very predictable movie. Overall, go ahead and watch it and enjoy it for what it is. Just don't expect anything new."

","I was lucky enough to catch an advance screening of this movie, and I was extremely glad I did. After watching the previews I felt as though a lot of the movie was given away, but I was blown away by the performances on screen. The movie was centered around a champion prize fighter hitting rock bottom, and slowly climbing his way back into the ring. It was an emotional journey that cannot simply be categorized as a movie about boxing, but rather, an inspiring and riveting tale of parenthood and a father's love for his daughter. The cast was excellent and everyone excelled in their roles. I wouldn't have expected to like Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson in a role as much as I did. Jake Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker had Oscar worthy performances. Everyone did a great job with their roles. The cinematography was fantastic, and the fight scenes gave some great first person shots that made you feel as though you were there in the ring fighting along side the actors. Overall, this movie is an experience that is not to be missed. 9/10"
"dustinhenson","8","46","70","24 August 2015"," Solid Film
","Southpaw is a drama/sports film directed by Antoine Fuqua and stars Jake Gyllenhaal. Although clichéd, the way the story of this film is told is what makes it great. The acting was great throughout the film especially by Gyllenhaal and ,surprisingly, Oona Laurence was fantastic. The film was well directed. Especially the boxing scenes themselves were shot very well and did a good job of really putting you in the shoes of the fighters. The dramatic scenes were done very well but we're very dark and depressing. This is not a light hearted film by any means. It deals with very sad subjects and is very gritty. On the negative side of things there is not much to say. It was well paced, well directed, and very well acted by everyone. It earns a solid 8/10."
"MattBirk","5","54","89","24 July 2015"," About as Generic as a Boxing Movie could be!
","This will be short, Southpaw is about as straightforward as you would expect from a boxing movie. A once great fighter falls into despair only to be given another chance at redemption in some sort of title fight. This movie hit just about every single plot point you would expect it to. And that's what makes Southpaw feel so dull and unengaging, it holds too few surprises. He gets beaten down again and again only to find redemption later in the movie just as expected. This is the type of movie where if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie, period!<br/><br/>But to no surprise, however, Jake Gyllenhaal is the saving grace of the movie (the 5/10 score would certainly be lower if he had not been in this movie). He is physically committed (looks like a complete beast), but is also able to bring the necessary emotional state the character required. If he had not been in the movie, this would have been a complete disaster. He totally fit the role of the down on his luck boxer, but more importantly hit the role of the damaged father even better. And even though we know exactly what is coming to our 'hero', the performance by Gyllenhaal makes it seem a tad more enjoyable.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, you've seen a ton of movies like Southpaw. You could probably predict the ending of the story based on the trailers alone. Even though Jake Gyllenhaal gives it his all, the movie can't help but fail because of the extremely generic script.<br/><br/>Instead, go watch The Wrestler again!"
"bartonj2410","9","55","91","25 July 2015"," Very good tale of redemption with a KO performance from Jake Gyllenhaal
","As with most sports dramas, Southpaw is a film more about the man than the sport. Labelled by many as the 'modern day Raging Bull', I had high hopes for Southpaw and thanks to Jake Gyllenhaal, it duly delivered. This is a tale of one man's path to redemption through boxing.<br/><br/>Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the Light Heavyweight champion of the world and a boxer known for his unique style and impressive fight record. When his wife, Maureen (Rachel McAdams), is shot dead following a scuffle with title contender Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez), both Billy's career and personal life go in a downward spiral that sees him both lose his boxing licence and his daughter, Leila (Oona Laurence), to child protection services.<br/><br/>Billy turns to trainer Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) to help him get his life back on track. Carry on down the same path and Billy could lose his daughter forever however, putting his focus into a return to boxing could see Billy regain everything he lost after the death of his wife.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, the film focuses more on the man than the sport however, Southpaw is one of the only boxing dramas I have seen where the sport of boxing actually feels like a character in the film, not just a backdrop for the drama.<br/><br/>Southpaw does become a bit predictable and features quite a few clichés, which can't be helped in this genre, but director Antoine Fuqua does a good job in making sure Southpaw has a bit of a cutting edge to it. This is a hard hitting drama that isn't scared to throw the hardest of punches at its audience.<br/><br/>After leaving the cinema, I read that Eminem had been lined up for the role of Billy Hope when the film first came into production. How different a film that would have been. I could not be more thankful that the studio decided not to follow through with that and instead decided to cast Gyllenhaal in the role instead.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal is an actor who makes it clear that he takes his roles very seriously and you can see that from the transformation he has put his body through, becoming almost unrecognisable from the skinny Lou Bloom in Nightcrawler. His gruelling six month training regime certainly makes him look like a boxer but his decision to learn the boxing techniques means he moves like a boxer too, making the performance even more authentic.<br/><br/>The transformation would mean absolutely nothing without the performance to match though. As expected, Gyllenhaal gives an absolute powerhouse of a performance in Southpaw that really raises the quality of the film because without him, this would be quite an average film. I struggle to think of an actor right now on a hotter streak in Hollywood than Gyllenhaal.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker, as usual, adds a quality to proceedings and Rachel McAdams does a fine job in her small role, which would have been better if we hadn't seen her characters outcome in the trailers. Oona Laurence gives an impressive performance as the young Leila and I didn't even mind 50 Cent or Rita Ora being cast in the film.<br/><br/>The boxing sequences are very good as well, with the use of POV shots in particular injecting the sequences with adrenaline and making the audience feel every single punch thrown.<br/><br/>While Southpaw isn't the masterpiece that Raging Bull is, it certainly sees Fuqua make his best film since Training Day. Led by another top performance from Gyllenhaal, maybe Southpaw will make the voters this awards season stand up and take notice of his talent, not ignore it like they did with Nightcrawler."
"bhcoopa","5","52","87","25 July 2015"," Disappointment to Fighters; Plays on Stereotypical, Hyper-Aggressive Male Boxers; Not a Credible Story
","As a previous fighter, this movie is a disappointment. The movie stereotypes boxers as hyper-aggressive characters who need vice and aggressive behavior to handle the short comings thrown their way. Gyllenhaal's performance was pretty impressive in contrast to his previous roles, however it does not save the movie from its bad writing and directing. Although some of the boxing sequences aren't bad, some of them are awful and some are impressive, good fight sequences don't make a story great, and for that matter, a movie.<br/><br/>The movie just doesn't have a very credible story, as Billy Hope accepts fights as early as 4 weeks away from one another, not nearly enough time to actually prepare for a new opponent. His wife takes on the ""momma knows best role"" as she makes the majority of decisions for him and his family, including their decision for Him to stop fighting, and when she is accidentally shot, Hopes life spirals out of control. After engaging in a spree of self- destructive behavior, CPS takes custody of his child until he can prove that he is a responsible adult. Normally, this would imply that the movie should be about the Hero overcoming and conquering himself and his aggressive habits. He is instructed to go to Anger Management classes, which are not present in the film, and gets suspended from professional boxing after head-butting a referee, after his corner throws the towel in for a fight. <br/><br/>After losing his luxurious lifestyle from not having the cash to pay for his bills, he finds a new gym that is ran by Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) so that he may teach young men how to box in hopes that it will lead them to grow up and become responsible men. Billy Hope cleans the gym at night for a job and trains with Tick in the mornings so that he can improve his image and possibly get a few side fights. After fighting for a charity event, Hope's agent (50 cent) finds him yet again pressuring him to get back into the ring, that he can get his suspension lifted and makes a $30 million offer to fight Miguel Escobar only 6 weeks away, a disgustingly short amount of time away to prepare for a fight. Understandably, these quick fights are supposed to represent the greed of his Agent making money, but fights like this at the professional level, at the championship level do not happen this quickly, ever.<br/><br/>Billy Hope takes the offer and continues to train with Tick Wills, but for this upcoming fight, it's back to fundamentals. During a montage with Eminem in the background, Billy Hope is working on basic things like stance, bobbing and weaving, blocking punches, blocking punches with your shoulder and other very basic things like that you couldn't have previously won a championship without, that apparently Billy Hope did. Meanwhile, Miguel Escobar is doing hardcore ab-workouts, and going hard on a double-ended bag, things that real professionals work on, also things that you couldn't otherwise do at that speed, without previously working on basic things like Billy is currently working on. Billy also works on boxing Southpaw upon Ticks suggestion.<br/><br/>Night of the fight, Billy and Miguel go at it, it is a very close one, and of course Billy Hope is hit with a low blow and whenever Miguel can't win the round, he mentions something to Billy about his wife which causes him to get very angry. Round 12 comes around and after a long round Billy connects and then connects again with a left handed uppercut.<br/><br/>The movie shouldn't be named ""Southpaw"" just on the premise that the winning punch was left handed. I really thought I was coming in to see a really awesome Southpaw performance out of Jake Gyllenhal, as those fighters give a different dynamic to a fight; Southpaws screw everybody up, even other Southpaw fighters, because everyone is used to fighting right-handed fighters. I give this movie a 5 because it plays on stereotypically, hyper-aggressive male behavior in boxers, and because the story just wasn't very credible. Impressive fight- sequences don't save a movie from the use of too many melodramatic scenes of one on one dialogue."
"vaghatz","3","36","59","30 October 2015"," Forced clichés and unrealistic scenario
","Forced clichés and unrealistic scenario<br/><br/>Here you have it, I described the hole movie on the title. This movie is unbelievable bad. We watched it yesterday and we literally couldn't believe how could they messed so bad.<br/><br/>The movie attempts to include as much clichés as possible, but this is not the real issue. The real issue is that the clichés are really forced into the script and presented totally unrealistic. Let's examine:<br/><br/>1. The boxer (Hope) is hyper-aggressive. OK so this boxer is the top dog with 40+ victories but he never learned to block....<br/><br/>2. His wife gets murdered and no one is blamed. This part is where the story really goes downhill! Hope and his wife were on a philanthropic event inside a casino. The arch enemy of the boxer after the event start to talk smack about the boxer's wife and they start to fight. So far so good. Out of nowhere someone of the arch-enemy's bodyguards draws a gun and accidentally kills the Hope's wife. WTF, how is even possible to have a gun inside a casino? And why he draw a gun? To shoot the protagonist? Inside the casino? With people watching? And why shoot him, wasn't the whole plan of the antagonist to start this fist fight? <br/><br/>Then the woman dies on the floor and nobody does anything to catch the killer! No one of the hundreds of attendees saw anything! And the protagonist don't even try during the rest of the movie to bring the killer to justice. The directors wanted a dead wife to build a sad story but they made no attempt to design a realistic death or a realistic aftermath of the murder.<br/><br/>3. The ultra successful boxer after his wife death loses one fight and punches the referee. This incident is enough from turning him from super rich living to a huge mansion with a collection of luxury cars to completely financially broke. WTF? This forced misery in order to build an arch is so laughably unrealistic! <br/><br/>4. Hope crashes his car on a tree on purpose and his kid is immediately removed from his custody. Why? He didn't harm any one else but himself and the car. He crashed inside his garden so he caused no threat to anyone else for crying out loud! The kid that until that point loved her father and cried her eyes out when the jury decided to separate her from him, after one week away from the father, now hates him!.... Is this a parody, because if it is, well done!? The only justification from the kid's hate towards the protagonist is a line of the kid's therapist: ""not everything revolves around you, you should respect her emotions""<br/><br/>5. Latter on a young boy boxer (Hoppy) dies in a tragic family incident and the protagonist with his trainer soak to tears. Another forced cliché in a pathetic attempt to make the viewer feel sad. Hoppy before his death had a total of 1 minute on-screen time and there was no build up to his death, just a quick ""I heard there were some fighting between his mom and dad"". No one was invested on the kids life so seeing the protagonist and the trainer cry didn't do anything emotionally to the viewer. In my opinion this sub-plot should have been completely removed. If you don't have time and interest to build a decent sub-plot, don't include it on the movie. It just looks like a cheap attempt to make the viewer feel sad.<br/><br/>OK let's move on and talk about the antagonist (Miguel). Same pattern here, rushed and forced. We are introduced to the antagonist at the start of the movie where Miguel start taking smack to Hope during a press conference. The antagonist just stands on the crowd and asks for a ""real"" match between him and the protagonist. When we saw this part of the film, no one knew who this is, he might as well be a drunk who managed to pass security. Why the protagonist was upset after-wards? Nobody knew.... In fact there is no descent explanation of the hate between these 2 characters. Also throughout the film Miguel is just there to serve as an arch-enemy. No character build up, no back story, nothing.<br/><br/>All this points are show stoppers so there is no need to talk about anything else about this movie. My three star rating is for Forest Whitaker (the trainer) who tried inside this mess of a movie to give a solid performance.<br/><br/>One last thing, at the end Hope wins with an unexpected move, Karate Kid anyone?!"
"bkoganbing","8","18","28","6 November 2015"," Hope springs eternal
","Jake Gyllenhaal gives his fans his best work since Brokeback Mountain as light heavyweight champion Billy Hope who suffers a horrific personal tragedy beyond any I've ever seen in a boxing film and comes back from it. For what he goes through Sylvester Stallone had it easy. As Brokeback Mountain got him an Oscar nomination maybe Southpaw will do the same.<br/><br/>Billy Hope is a kid raised in an orphanage as a foundling as is his loving and supportive wife Rachel McAdams. They have a daughter played by Oona Laurence who is their whole world. When McAdams is killed in an unspeakable tragedy, Gyllenhaal's world falls apart and he has to make one long comeback.<br/><br/>As a kid who was raised by the social welfare system it's the system that decides what he must do to gain back his child. Gyllenhaal is wonderful as a man who successfully conquers the badder angels of his nature to gain it all back, title, child, and self respect.<br/><br/>McAdams should be singled out for a moving death scene ranking up there with some of the screen's best. Also Forest Whitaker who trains the ex-champ for his comeback should also be singled out.<br/><br/>Watching Gyllenhaal as Billy Hope put me in mind of heavyweight contender Hurricane Jackson when I was a kid. There's no science in Hope's style, he just wades in and brawls. Hope will take two or three punches to get in his shot. As McAdams points out he'll be punch drunk within a few years. Whitaker puts a little science in his boxing persona. Hurricane Jackson was very much like Billy Hope and did in fact end up punch drunk.<br/><br/>This is a fine boxing film and Oscar nominations could come for Gyllenhaal and McAdams."
"PeaceGuard","5","22","36","22 September 2015"," A really disappointing one.
","I started to watch this movie hoping that it can be a good fighting film, but it didn't fulfill my Hope.<br/><br/>We are introduced to a world champion who won 44 fights and who CAN'T DEFEND/BLOCK AT ALL. Well.. it doesn't need much comment. They didn't even bother to show any single block in his first fights. No one who has ever seen or especially if you are interested in boxing fights can treat it as something probable. Box is mostly a game of tactics and technique, where most of the punches are either evaded or blocked. Very many punches reach their target. Unlike in this movie. So he gets to the top again by.. learning how to use a block. Woow. And they even invented some crazy way of covering your face by raising your shoulder. Yeah.. it's a really great way to do that. A pity none of the real boxers uses it. Probably it's because it doesn't cover the face at all and the only effect of it is that you can't use the arm you raise to effectively punch. So it's just a movie bluff. There are many other things.. he's given a title fight immediately after his ban is over. Some addicted woman is pointed with a gun by the main character and she takes a newborn to cover herself.. yeah, that's also a probable reaction. And many other small things.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie is just very predictable. It tries to aspire for a good ""fall and rise"" movie, but it fails. The only things this movie is ""good"" at it some street rap music and naked chests to attract female audience. A pity."

","Southpaw is a movie about the successful boxing champion Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) whose life begins to fall apart because he cannot control his high temper.<br/><br/>To begin with, the story line is simple and not very original. The protagonist who has everything suddenly loses everything and needs to find a new way to win it all back. Haven't I seen this before? And I'm not even talking about movies in general. Actually, one can find boxing movies with a very similar story (for instance Rocky II or Raging Bull).<br/><br/>The characters depth is nothing near to the ones we see in ""Raging Bull"" or ""Warrior"" (movies in which motivations and reasons of characters are more complex and interesting). In Southpaw, the characters lack depth, thus they become a tad boring. Personally, I felt like flat character design was one of the main issues of this movie. Furthermore, you always felt like someone already told this story in a much better way. Why should I waste my time to watch a poor remake? Naturally, this sounds harsh and may be a little exaggerated, but I honestly believe this is the major aspect of the movie that annoyed me – unoriginality and the incorporation of many clichés.<br/><br/>I would still recommend you this movie, only because of two people: Jake Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker. These two tremendous actors made this movie not a total waste of time. As aforementioned, Gyllenhaal plays in the lead, portraying the struggling fighter Billy Hope. It is a stupendous performance from a brilliant actor. Although the character is partly despicable and should be hated, one does still feel for him. That is the work of a master in his craft. Academy Award winner Whitaker plays Tick Wills, an older gym owner who later becomes Billy's mentor and new coach after his demise. The relation between those two characters is the best one in the whole movie. What happens when chaos and fury meet experience and discipline? These two spectacular actors were the absolute highlight of the movie, which makes it a bit frustrating to see so less of them on screen. The filmmakers rather concentrated on Billy's relation with his daughter than on the one I found deeply entertaining.<br/><br/>This leads to my other point. I found that the role of Oona Laurence was a miscast. She plays the daughter of Billy and is devastated after a certain incident. Things between her and Billy do not work quite well (I can just recall, ""Haven't I seen this before?"") The only scene of this side story that touched me was when Billy got slapped in the face by his own daughter. That's it, nothing more. Moreover, I did not like Laurence in the movie. No offense, but she was not very convincing and rather annoying.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I thought that the rest of the cast delivered. Rachel McAdams and even 50cent impressed me – gorgeous casting.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was nothing exceptional or anything to remember. I think ""average"" sums it up pretty well. Southpaw did not quite live up to my high expectations, although having some great actors on board. What you see was nothing original or mind-blowing, it felt like a bad ""Raging Bull"" spin off. I can still recommend the movie to people who love sport movies in general and want to see some great acting. Otherwise, leave it and don't watch it. 6/10"
"room102","3","34","61","3 September 2015"," Fuqua shouldn't make any more movies
","WARNING: Major spoilers in this review<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua shows again what a bad director he is. This movie is a combination of a terrible plot and writing, and bad direction. The only good thing about this movie is Jake Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker.<br/><br/>In this movie, you have the champion of the world in boxing, who makes tens of million of dollars and lives in a mansion, manages in a few days to somehow lose his wife, his job, his house, his daughter, to become a drugged/alcohol addict, a suicidal and a potential killer. This is the plot of a goofy comedy, not a boxing drama. It's ridiculous and it makes absolutely no sense. It also takes half the movie time and the situations repeat themselves like a bad soap opera: mistake -> tragedy - > sad music ... and repeat.<br/><br/>The characters are brainless and have moronic motives. Just as an example, this guy who is so worried about his daughter, has no problem wanting/trying to commit suicide - and more than once.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams is terrible. From the beginning of the movie I said to myself that we see her WAY too much - and I knew there was a reason for that. Showing her tits and body all the time is the fault of the director. But the bad acting is a combination of bad direction, bad writing and Rachel fault.<br/><br/>A minor getting into a family court for custody case? Are you kidding me? Was this movie written by a 10-year old? His wife dies and the first thing he does after the funeral is leave his minor daughter alone? Did the writer live under a stone or something? This is an obvious attempt to show us that the character is suffering, but it's cheap and makes absolutely no sense.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua is simply a bad director. He can't direct actors and his movies are just bad. Training Day was a decent movie at best, but somehow it made him big in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker are the only good thing about this movie, but they can't save a movie that was so poorly written and directed."
"Rageypoo","5","13","20","29 August 2015"," To anyone saying this is our generations ""Rocky"" must be ""Punch Drunk""
","**SPOILERS***<br/><br/>This movie is packed with a 1-2 combination of cliché story elements and very convenient character situations. The movie starts off well, we establish the characters very easily with Jake Gyllenhaal and Rachel McAdams's generous chemistry, and they both look incredible on the set together, easily steals the show. 50 cent looked clean and dapper, and Forest Whitaker delivered great realism, and that's about where it ends. <br/><br/>The Story shows a man who is just loaded with money. He's a mindblowing 43-0 (yea right) and during his after fight press conference, was interrupted by a would-be trash talking contender...OK sure that's great, seems solid so far, but from there the story goes a bit out of control. 50 cent working purely in his own interest, tries working a $30 million dollar deal using Gyllenhaal, and his wife being the brains behind the duo, quickly shoots it down believing that any more fights would permanently injure her husband and turn him into a walking tomato. VERY conveniently and shortly thereafter, Rachel McAdams is shot and killed by ""accident"" after a brawl broke out between the trash talking contender and Gyllenhaal, and quickly loses everything, and I mean everything. Somehow he goes from millionaire, to broke, to losing his kids and his home, car, and I guess non-existent savings, there isn't even anything in the plot about how maybe the wife hid money or someone stole the money from him, nope he just somehow had too many expenses and simply lost all his money. The story then moves to how he has to completely change who he is to satisfy his new boxing coach, his overbearing court decisions to take away his kid, and somehow make back the money he seemed to lose in an instant. Despite all that struggle, there is very little connection with any of the other characters after McAdams leaves the scene, and very little attachment to any of the very typical plot development other than he comes back and wins with seemingly very little struggle. The movie being called ""southpaw"" by the way is not about the fighter actually being a southpaw at all, neither was the contender, but conveniently called that because of an Eminem single and for magically landing an uppercut in the final round of the final fight by switching stances (which we didn't see) and that's it. Despite great performances, much of the story just left me wondering ""why do I care about any of this"" for a big chunk of the movie. <br/><br/>You can also feel that there are parts to the story that are suppose to make us feel bad or force us to feel connected to the characters that just don't work or don't seem to fit. Losing his child is very difficult, but her behavior and reactions though seemingly honest and real, don't seem to make much sense and seem a bit unrealistic, she seemed very close with her dad and ended up wishing he was dead were quite the extremes. The same can be said for the character Hoppy, who spent maybe 3 minutes of on screen time with Gyllenhaal and ended up losing his life in a domestic violence dispute with his family. There is a very real performance by Forest Whitaker about the situation, but why is it important to us as the audience? They didn't even touch on the character that much and we are suppose to have an emotional reaction? That in a nutshell is how the entire movie felt after the first 20 minutes. <br/><br/>I did watch the film through to the end, so for that I give it a 5 for keeping me interested at least through the whole show. The villain was too thuggish to be taken seriously, his reasons for losing all of his money didn't seem realistic, and much of how the story developed did so in a way that didn't seem to be very logical in real life, and VERY far from the well thought out movie that Rocky was."

"reviewsbycaleb","4","15","24","24 July 2015"," Beaten by Clichés
","Strengths: Gyllenhaal's fantastic performance Weaknesses: Grotesque and Compounding Clichés, over revealing trailer, uneven supporting characters, narrative familiarity...etc, this was a bad movie.<br/><br/>A paradox, contradiction, how could Gyllenhaal team up with director Antoine Fuqua? The actor that has come out with some of my favorite films in recent years teams up with the director of The Equalizer, and Olympus has Fallen to do a boxing movie? As many of my readers know, last year's NightCrawler blew me away and was my favorite movie that year, and the year before Prisoner's was my favorite movie, and the year before End of Watch was among my favorites of the year. Even with one of my favorite actors, Jake Gyllenhaal, I had low expectations, and even those weren't met.<br/><br/>Southpaw begins with crazed boxer Billy Hope in his pre fight mindset, getting his fists wrapped before using them. His headphones are in and they are loud, muting everything else out with pure adrenaline, then his wife Maureen, played very efficiently by Rachel McAdams, enters. Everyone leaves the room and she takes off his headset and tells him to not getting punched too much, their is an obvious connection between these two that is magnetic. Strong start that raised my eyebrows due to my doubts coming in.<br/><br/>What ensues is a rocky reincarnate, all punch and no block brawl. In the HBO telecast, there is a hint at another boxer, Miguel Escobar, and that the winner of this fight will hopefully get to fight him. This really takes the steam out of the opening fight, up to that point I honestly wasn't sure if Gyllenhaal was going to win or not, but that unnecessary add-in blocked the intensity of that scene. Escobar really wanting to fight Hope, challenges him in a mocking way at the post fight press conference and by the logic of this movie, just because he won that fight. The fight made him 42-0, really who wants to fight a 41-0 guy? Billy speaks at a charity that supports orphans, which him and Maureen were growing up. Escobar is in attendance and kind of apologized to Billy for how he acted but Billy just brushes him off, which upsets Escobar and he says some disgracing things about Maureen. Well naturally being boxers, this leads to a battle royal of sorts between Escobar, Hope and their crews. In the process Maureen gets shot and dies.<br/><br/>You may think that is a spoiler but it really isn't, THEY SHOW IT IN THE TRAILER, I know right...stupid. The whole way leading up to that could of been really solid for all I know, but I don't know because whatever dumb executive who made the trailer gave away the emotional climax of the movie. Everything preceding has been a worn narrative throughout the years...with the perfectly loving parents who have the perfect relationship. It would of worked if I didn't know the big event, but the trailer gave it away and I just saw Fuqua amateurishly build to get the emotional return. Looking back on it, that relationship really did work and I don't want to blame the movie, for the misstep of the trailer, so I just upped my rating a little bit after further thought. Adams and Gyllenhaal...sparks fly between the two.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie turns into a tragedy of Hope's life and his fight for custody of his daughter so she doesn't follow in her fathers footsteps of being an orphan. He goes to train at Wills gym and meets the owner Tick (Forest Whitaker). Together they train and fight to get both their lives back on track for the people around them. Really promising stuff and in more talented hands would of worked, but Southpaw stalls to a melodramatic bore in the middle. But wow, I went this long and haven't talked about Gyllenhaal, he was great Not shocking. Not surprising, he was completely lost in this role (which is a good thing) and I forgot it was him, just as what happened in Nightcrawler. Jake Gyllenhaal truly has been the actor of the past 4 years. Then Fuqua almost squishes the enjoyment of the performances out with all to used clichés around every single corner. Since his 2001 Training Day, Fuqua has been hackish and has squandered many promising movies. The narrative is completely by the books here, other than the devastating climatic moment given away before you even got to the theaters, and there are some side stories that go on that are laughable due to the poor misplacement. Supporting characters do things that are so uneven with the character laid out for them. Potential complex characters were given way by temptations of clichés and lesser cinema.<br/><br/>If you go to Southpaw, go searching a character study of Gyllenhaal's Billy Hope, that is the only reward this movie has to offer."
"s-patzman","3","45","91","24 July 2015"," Superficial Spectacle.
","3/10 just for Gyllenhaal - burdened with a paper thin character and script overwrought with so many clichés it borders on plagiarism - who managed to breathe the smallest amount of life into this ""feature"" film.<br/><br/>I can understand the hype, with a new track from Eminem and Hollywood darling's McAdams, Gyllenhaal, & Whitaker, bloody spit takes, and convincing eye make up - what could go wrong? The catch is it's completely superficial. Too often we mistake glitzy effects and name branding for quality. Southpaw exemplifies this to a fault. We are guided to believe the walking plot points are characters, that the dialogue is remotely passable (the commentators laughably bad), most of all that we see a portrayal of poverty, addiction, or isolation behind the gloves. But we never get there.<br/><br/>In fact we never see the hard streets of new york - save for transition shots and an exterior of Will's Gym. We never see Hope's spiraling inebriation following his wife's passing - just a news headline and a silly crash sequence that comes out of the blue. We get cuts and montages the imply his falling apart, but alas it is a spectacle we never see. Save for a one off apartment scene and a character so thinly written he wasn't given a real name (Hoppy), the only poverty we experience is through hackneyed dialogue about growing up in the foster care system. In truth 80% of the movie is in the ring, locker room, or gym.<br/><br/>This movie relies so heavily on Gyllenhaal's performance that it's insulting. Insulting that today a name and some make up is enough to paint an otherwise vapid and lackluster production as a masterpiece. And I wanted to love this movie so badly as a massive fan of boxing movies."
"robertdinkel","5","31","60","29 July 2015"," Kind of a remake of parts of Rocky 1-3
","The story works generously from the lore of the Rocky movies and has a predictable ending. If you're too young to have seen the early Rocky movies, you might think this movie is wonderful. HBO did a lot of work to make the fights look good, but the punches are too slow to be confused with real, top level professional boxing. <br/><br/>The story is needlessly emotional for a sports movie. At moments it is a total tear jerker to the point where any redemption is a Pyrrhic victory at best. Jake Gyllenhaal did a lot to make this movie better than it should have been, a lesser actor in his role would have made this movie quite bad."
"classicsoncall","8","4","5","26 December 2015"," ""...you got to let her go through her thing and not think that thing is your thing.""
","To one degree or another we've seen this movie before. What's different in the approach for me were the parallel stories of Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhall) and Tick Wills (Forest Whittaker), each lamenting a course of action they took that led to terrible unintended consequences. Both outcomes resulted in the death of loved ones, for Billy his wife, and for trainer Wills, young Hoppy (Skylan Brooks) who Wills felt responsible for and didn't do enough to protect from a troubled family life. Both men seek some semblance of redemption by gutting out their despair and challenging themselves to take up the good fight once again.<br/><br/>There's some resonance here for anyone dealing with family issues in which Child Protective Services is a factor. For all the discomfort one might experience watching those scenes of Billy trying to connect with his daughter, the flip side is that he put her in danger and responsible parties stepped in at the appropriate time. The family court judge acted accordingly upon the recommendation of the supervising case worker. The scenario represented here was intelligently handled.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is exceptional here, though as others on this board have commented, the way he transforms his ring style under the tutelage of 'Dream Crusher' Wills is somewhat unfathomable. Using the shoulder technique to protect his face in the showdown match against 'The Magic' looked just plain awkward. The split decision ending would precede the one in ""Creed"" by a few short months, suggesting that everything old is new again when you put a different spin on it."
"hell-cat-1","2","16","29","4 August 2015"," Terrible movie (from an ex-boxer)
","To start with, if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. It was unbelievably contrived and predictable. Jake Gyllenhaal did an okay job but was totally unbelievable as a boxer. Really, 43 fights and no cauliflower ears? There were far too many stupid moment in the movie, such as his wife getting shot. Nobody could find the killer, like there isn't CCTV cameras in luxury hotels or anything. Ridiculous premise!<br/><br/>Also, his character was completely unsympathetic. I have suffered more than my fair share of grief and anyone who neglects their own child like that because they are selfish and caught up in their own grief is a piece of crap. All he cared about were his own feeling and what was happening with him, when you have a child that you are responsible for, you cannot behave like this. It should be the first thing you leave behind when you have a child. Disgusting parenting. Not to mention the fast that he shouldn't have got caught up in that petty fight that led to his wife getting killed in the first place. She pleaded with him to walk on, but again he only thought about himself.<br/><br/>And now on to the actual boxing. Dear God, it was boring and awkward to watch. As an ex Muay Thai boxer, the fight scenes were ridiculous. Usually, in boxing movies, I get totally excited and caught up in the fights due to my background, but this was just boring and so obviously fake to me. They were basically slapping each other, there was no impact or power when they hit one another, it was laughable! I know it's acting but I've seen great boxing movies where the fights were realistic. I cannot believe all of the positive review surrounding this movie, which prompted me to go in the first place, so disappointed!"
"brendandevere","8","14","25","23 August 2015"," Hope is a good thing.
","I walked into the cinema with a preconceived expectation that 'Southpaw' was going to be another boxing film with a clichéd tale about a man turning around his life for the good something greater than himself. It was an expectation I was willing to ignore in the hope (no pun intended)of seeing something fresh and original. I then realised when I was waiting for the movie to begin that when it comes to the fight game, there is only so much you can tell. Boxing is always going to be clichéd, but that is why we come back to see the same story over and over again. Everybody loves to root for the underdog and everybody loves to see a person fall from grace and then with a hard fought struggle, reclaim their dignity through redemption.<br/><br/>How many fight films have there been? Anybody could name at least three, and most are pretty good stories. 'Rocky' made a star out of Stallone, 'Raging Bull' got De Niro the Academy Award and films like 'Cinderella Man' and 'Ali' were critically acclaimed with standout performances from their leading men. I'm not saying 'Southpaw' is up there with these films but the basic plot is no different from any of these great movies. What is common is the performances of the actors, who give their heart and soul, with each one outstandingly giving a predictable script the feeling that you have just watched a good piece of theatre.<br/><br/>This is out and out Jake Gyllenhaal's film, with a performance that is every bit as worthy of an awards season nomination than anything he has done in the past. He will be ignored by organisations such as the Academy of Film for this performance but he is truly an actor at the top of his game. It will not be long before he finds the role that will put him echelon of actors that have ever stood in front of a camera.<br/><br/>He plays Billy Hope, who is the undisputed, undefeated Light Heavyweight Champion of the world, using his raw aggressive emotion to win his fights. In his corner is his loyal beautiful wife, Maureen (Rachel McAdams), who is becoming concerned that Billy is starting to take to much punishment for the sake of victory inside the ring. After an unpredictable and tragic event, Billy loses everything, including his daughter, Leila (Oona Laurence) and his championship belts. He is a man at the very bottom but with the help of an old school trainer named Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker), Billy turns his life around for the sake of his daughter and finds the determination he needs to live the rest of his life with dignity and respect.<br/><br/>Yes, yes. Very clichéd and we have all seen it before but the film pulls hard on the heart strings and you find yourself really wanting Billy to come out on top. Young Oona Laurence is magnificent as Billy's daughter, giving an emotional performance of a girl confused and angry about her father's fall from grace. Forest Whitaker doesn't let the production down and 50 Cent is surprisingly engaging in his turn as the boxing promoter that is only interested in making money and lots of it, to the detriment of his fighters. Director, Antione Fuqua has delivered the audience his best production since 'Training Day' and has been able to turn a over told story into a movie that oozes emotion and feeling.<br/><br/>Ignore the predictable script and focus on the memorable performances of the actors and you will come away with a very satisfying experience."

Wow Billy has hit rock bottom. Then he connects with trainer Tick Willis(Forest Whitaker)it's thru this time of learning and rediscovery of hope and heart that Billy once again rises to the top!

","Southpaw is a pretty standard sports movie. Even more specific, it's a pretty standard redemption story. It focuses on a successful boxer living the seemingly perfect life but also taken over by pride until life takes most of his glory away. It could work as a really powerful drama about a man lifting himself up after a number of tragedies that happen too instantly. While the movie does evidently captures the brutality of Hope's harsh situation, the story follows an unimpressively conventional path. Every transition of event feels awkward, rushed or unnatural. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance helps keeping the movie's strength, but it's just isn't enough to surpass the film's blandness.<br/><br/>The movie never apparently fails at portraying the ugliest side of what the main character is going through, we can see the pain and misfortune to how his career and life fall apart. But the trouble here has to do with the narrative. Much of the characters aren't given much development and they often exist as a plot device, if they aren't then they're defined by clichéd characterization and dialogue. Each moment of the struggle, mostly at the second act, isn't really as meaty as it should be. These scenes just pass through, like they're resolved instantly, hardly felt like it earned something or at least overwhelmingly for the story. The movie does eventually pay off at the climactic boxing match, but the build up for it never seems rewarding.<br/><br/>If anything else, the movie does understand the atmosphere, it's filled with bleakness, covered with dirt, blood and sweat; literally and metaphorically (if I know what I'm talking about.) If the storyline can't get past by its conventional rhythms then the movie at least sets the tone perfectly. It is more watchable when the character is in the ring, it is shot like it's an actual match, while the camera does try to be gimmicky with the POVs, but I digress, it's quite more interesting when we see more fighting in this film instead. The real merit that brought serious commitment to this film is definitely nothing more than Jake Gyllenhaal. You can see the performance carry the character's pain through the journey.<br/><br/>Southpaw's ultimate contrivance is what keeps itself from being engaging. Though Jake Gyllenhaal did try to make a character who doesn't have a lot of depth work, it's still not enough to make it all seem worth it. The story can be great, there is some interesting aspects that could deliver a stronger theme, but the movie is unable to make every step of the plot feel authentic and makes the characters as generic as possible; leading to an entertaining, yet unsatisfying climax. There is a lot of wasted potentials in the end."

","This film is aimed at kids/teenagers<br/><br/>If you are over the age of 25 and are male or if you are a genuine fan of boxing you are unlikely to enjoy this film<br/><br/>Here are a few things that really wound me up about this film:<br/><br/>1) The storyline was beyond predictable. It's been done a million times. Where were the plot twists? The only twist is his wife dying which is in the synopsis.<br/><br/>2) There is no credible explanation as to how he has gone from living in this huge mansion with all his fancy cars, giving away rolexes to his pals for fun, to living in a bedsit with no food. <br/><br/>3) His record is 43 wins, 0 defeats, yet he is seen as a boxer who never bothers to block. Those are Mayweather stats. He would be one of the greatest of all time. But he is portrayed as a rough diamond. And the guy who is a young unheard of at the start of the film, a few months on, is described as technically the better fighter. This really ground my gears<br/><br/>4) The boxing scenes were so over the top, no one blocks. Every punch connects. I know it's only a film but I like a bit of realism<br/><br/>I had only heard good things about this film, although admittedly from an emotional young woman who obviously fancied the protagonist and my 22 year old house mate who would call any film he watched in the cinema, a work of art.

","If you are thinking about watching Southpaw, you might as well just watch its trailer and call it a day. This way you'll already know most of what the movie encompasses and waste only about 2 and half minutes of your life, opposed to the 2 hours it entails.<br/><br/>Realistically speaking, the movie is a horrific stretch of what the trailer already reveals. Billy Hope, ""light heavyweight champion of the world"", is challenged by wannabe competitor Miguel 'Magic' Escobar; and when a fight breaks out between the two, Hope's wife is shot and killed in a poorly staged lobby scene. The remainder of the movie consists of him falling apart because of his wife's death, which leads to him losing everything from his house, to custody of his daughter. Sound familiar? Probably because the plot is such a generic cliché.<br/><br/>If you think it's going to happen, that's probably because it will. This movie follows exactly what you'd expect, sliding in any and all clichés to do so; from Billy hitting rock bottom, to finding a trainer that can get him back into shape and onto the boxing ring again, the film does it all. Tick Willis (the trainer) who seemingly had a hatred for pro-boxing and wanted nothing to do with helping Billy, seems to magically forget this as he decides to train him. The boxing scenes in the movie contain the typical trades that leave both competitors bleeding, with the occasional smack talk about Billy's wife. Although the two are surrounded by numerous fans and cameras, the intended intense fighting scenes become dull from having little difference from any other boxing movie. While the audience in the movie seemed entertained in this fight, all I could do was yawn and pray for it to be over.<br/><br/>The director, Antoine Fuqua has made 21 movies to this day, most of which are crime related action movies. It's not hard to see that Southpaw was his first boxing movie, it's even easier to see that he should stick to crime related action movies. Jake Gyllenhaal spent five months working on his body, preparing for this film; if only the writing had half as much effort put into it; then perhaps the movie could have been entertaining. The original actor was actually supposed to have been Eminem, but he was smart enough to realize that this film wasn't going anywhere; then again, neither is he. But looking at the movie again, let's be real – if Jake Gyllenhaal being shirtless for most of the movie can't save it, nothing can."

"zkonedog","3","2","2","27 February 2017"," Has All The Necessary Clichés, But None Of The Necessary Character Development
","Despite the fact that boxing really hasn't been all that relevant for quite some time, boxing movies (or ""fight movies"" in general) are a favorite of mine. I count the ""Rocky"" series, ""The Champ"", ""Real Steel"", ""The Fighter"", and ""Warrior"" to be some of my favorite films of all-time. The reason? Boxing movies really aren't about boxing. They are about revealing character. There may not be a more straightforward sport: hit the other person repeatedly until him or you can't continue. Yet, it is through that ferocious simplicity that great character stories can be told and relationship examined. Sadly, ""Southpaw"" doesn't do nearly a good enough job with that character/relationship-building, instead just content to throw out all the old boxing clichés and hope they meld into something inspirational. They do not.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Southpaw"" tells the story of Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal), a light- heavyweight champion at the top of his game. He has beaten all-comers, has a beautiful wife (Rachel McAdams), and a lovely daughter (Oona Laurence). The only problem? Billy can't walk away from any fight (in OR out of the ring) and it leads to a brawl in which a great tragedy befalls him and his family. Starting over basically from square one, Billy finds a new trainer in Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) and begins to rebuild both his own life and that of his newly-shaped family.<br/><br/>Despite my earlier praise for the ""fight movie"" genre, many of its movies do use rather predictable clichés when dealing with the actual boxing portion of the flicks. In ""Southpaw"", every single one of those clichés is used in order to try and create a large amount of drama. There is the riches-to-rags-and-back-again story, the grizzled old trainer with the odd methods, the fracturing of the family life due to a violent sport, and the corruption of the entire business. Heck, ""Southpaw"" even rips off the old ""Rocky IV"" sequence of having interspersed shots of two boxing training with different styles...this time just set to an Eminem rap tune instead of a score.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, all those clichés do is cover up for the fact that the characters in this movie are not well-written or well-conceived whatsoever, and the plot adds absolutely nothing new to the genre. It is completely hollow once you look past the surface material. Sadder still, there really isn't even anything that I can point to as being really good about the film, besides perhaps the acting of Gyllenhaal (which itself is even ""just okay"" as there is no dramatic meat for him to work with). To be honest, a more accurate rating of this film for me would be 1.5 stars. I'll round it up to two stars because it at least as some coherency to it, but that is truly the only reason. Nothing else made me care about what I was seeing.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed in ""Southpaw"", as (when I first saw its trailers a few months ago) I predicted it would be perhaps the best movie I've seen all year. Boy, was that ever a ""punch to the gut"" (pardon the pun). Instead, it ended up as one of the most bland, hollow movies I've seen in quite sometime. Unless you've never seen a fight movie in your life and want to catch up on the mechanics of how they work, ""Southpaw"" will likely underwhelm you to the point of boredom. It just doesn't have any dramatic substance."

","Watching films about boxing is something I rarely do, or better having done it three times. The third is ""Southpaw"". I am glad to say that Jake Gyllenhaal gave me again the right to say that he is really an excellent actor when given the opportunity. I started watching the film feeling that I was not going to finish it, because of the violent nature of boxing... but... he kept me there, all the time! I know nothing about boxing and all that is related to, managers, trainers, lifestyle, money, bets etc... so I had to ""believe"" what I was watching in front of me. The love of a parent, the love of a trainer, the love of a wife, of a friend, the loss of the loved one, the betrayal, professional exploitation and abandonment when you are no longer needed ... and the aversion for oneself, until things start to find their place. Not something you do not encounter in real life, right? Curtis Jackson was a pleasant surprise! Mr Whitaker, again, has performed admirably. Jake Gyllenhaal... a boxer's face telling so much under his torn skin and blood. I would like to see them nominated, they deserve it."
"AudioFileZ","9","2","2","18 October 2015"," Learning To Live After Self Destruction
","I think it's kind of universal in that everyone likes a underdog story. Southpaw wastes little precious time in letting us in on the long-shot nature of Billy Hope as he's now at the top. But wait, whatever the story is we're here and Billy has already made it so this isn't really an underdog story at all. But, the life of a orphan who became a world-class boxer isn't going to be wine and roses just because he's now at a pinnacle of his sport. When you're at the top doesn't the old saying go ""there's no place left to go except down""? Old clichés' which have stood the test of time have a core that often is, mostly, a hard truth.<br/><br/>A boxer by nature, no matter how good, is often one fight away from his career being over, and not by choice. It's a fickle sport with a potent unknown around every corner waiting for their own long-shot success. As Southpaw begins Billy Hope is at that intersection of what comes next after reaching the top. His wife is urging him to take a break, or quit, before that disaster occurs. The disaster will occur, but it won't exactly be what one might think even as this seems like a movie you've seen before. In everything that proceeds Jake Gyllenhaal is close to perfect in bringing the fictitious life, and heartache, of Billy Hope to the screen. There's a new king of boxing movies, Jake Gyllenhaal is Southpaw in every sense of the phrase. Great movie, highly recommended! Two other fantastic performances,, though paling in comparison, are turned in by Forest Whittaker (Tick Willis) and Miguel Gomez ( ""Magic"" Escobar)."

","Given the cast that was listed in Southpaw (2015) it looked to be a great film, I was excited to check it out. Now let me put this out there, I'm not a big boxing fan but generally this movie looked appealing. I'm on my third time through watching it and honestly in the beginning first parts of the film I almost fell asleep every time. It seemed as if it took way too much time to build a story behind the main characters.<br/><br/>The big thing that really got my attention is that in watching it the movie seemed to follow the exact story of the original Rocky with a bit of money behind him already more per say a Rocky 2 remake of some sort. Now I'm certainly not a fan of 50 Cent as every time I see his name in something I seem to be looking for my quarters in my pocket; inside joke. Now yes the beginning of the movie did almost put me to sleep, but as the action began ""and you will see the part I'm mentioning"", I saw blood. I felt the aggression and emotion of this movie when that part took place, it was ""A Time to Kill"" mode. Then the story went full on emotional grind. I personally in a situation like this would be an instant explosion, an unstoppable destruction to anyone or anything in my way. The way they done this story was beautiful, calm versus if it were me, yet a great story.<br/><br/>Southpaw turned out to be a really great movie even given the beginning, it was really worth my three times watching it; and I hope you all enjoy it as well as I."

","The boxing movie genre—Raging Bull, Rocky, Million Dollar Baby, The Fighter —is commonly tackled in movies because of its inherent drama and overt conflict between the protagonist, a down-and-out boxer and a champion.

What is the former manager's malfeasance? What is the backstory of the trainer? Is there more to Billy's absence as a father, and his past relationship with his little girl? How does the title ""Southpaw"" add to the narrative?

"obro","7","9","17","5 August 2015"," A Powerful Cliché
","Boxing films tend to follow a formula, Southpaw is no different. We see a champion at the top of his game, he is later faced with tragedy,and then he spends the rest of the film trying to repair his life and regain his title in one last fight against an impressive opponent who has done wrong by him. Also they didn't forget to include a good old training montage.Southpaw really does hit all the clichés of the genre.<br/><br/>There is more going for this movie than these clichés though. Firstly the performances are great. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a performance that demonstrates his dedication to the role. He once again showed that he can transform himself physically to bring authenticity to his characters. Beyond his appearance he is very believable and likable which is actually quite important because when his character's life falls apart he spends a lot of time feeling sorry for himself and so the fact that the audience likes him and supports him is important so that they can feel sorry for him too. Another fantastic performance can be seen from Forest Whitaker although I think the stand out supporting performance in the film is from Oona Laurence who played the daughter of Gyllenhaal's character. I thought she gave an incredibly compelling performance especially for such a young actress with little. Her scenes with Jake Gyllenhaal were excellent too they had good chemistry and they really played off each other well as father and daughter.<br/><br/>The high standard of the performances helped to sell the drama in Southpaw, this was a relief to me because it meant that at least whilst watching the film the audience forgot that the what they were seeing was really nothing new or particularly special. Overall though the drama in Southpaw was quite captivating. As I've already mentioned the performances from Gyllenhaal and Laurence were great and so some scenes I thought were genuinely heartbreaking.<br/><br/>I can't review a boxing film without commenting on the scenes where there is actual boxing. Frankly they were superb. The way Antoine Fuqua decided to film the fight scenes is very raw and it's clear that realism was important to him. There were some brilliant shots in one of the fights where the camera acted as a first person view from one of the boxers and the opponent fighter would punch at the camera whilst it ducked and swayed. It was executed with skill and was therefore effective at throwing the audience straight into the brutality of a boxing match.<br/><br/>Southpaw was very entertaining, and as I didn't go into this expecting a masterpiece I was satisfied. It certainly wasn't the most original film I've ever seen but the powerful performances and the realistic boxing matches carried it over its cliché filled plot."

So off I went on a Thursday night.<br/><br/>The music on the trailer boasts M&M singing ""I am phenomenal,"" The lazy character that Jake chose to portray is everything but.

The movie was called ""Southpaw,"" which is the term used for lefty boxers, he was a righty (orthodox boxer). The scenes are disjointed, the characters are under-developed and therefore their relationships are non-believable. Sure the training part gets your motor running for a few seconds, but it leaves you unfulfilled and wanting more.<br/><br/>A poor attempt at re-inventing Rocky,"

However, the main character in his life is his wife, who's portrayed as having an intense interest in his affairs and as being a paragon of responsibility. It simply doesn't make sense that she would not have saved some of that money. Indeed, the script clearly suggests they had plenty of money as the wife was urging him to quit fighting so they could enjoy their wealth before he became permanently injured.<br/><br/>I don't think social services operate in the way depicted in the film. Hope is not abusive towards his daughter, it seems cruel and unusual to separate a child from her father after her mother has been killed.

I was surprised at the acting in this,,seemed a bit wooden at times by everybody involved and very few outside sequences made it feel a bit enclosed.

"bryank-04844","9","5","10","21 July 2015"," 'Southpaw' is the best boxing movie since 'Rocky'! Highly Recommended!
","When it comes to the world of boxing, there have been many films and documentaries that have been released on the violent sport. Some of the movies have done so well both financially and critically, that they have taken home more than one Oscar, and dare I say it, this new boxing film, 'Southpaw' is the best boxing movie since Sylvester Stallone put on boxing gloves in 1976 and put on one hell of a show against Carl Weathers in 'Rocky'. Despite its minor flaws, 'Southpaw' is an amazing film from top to bottom. Director Antoine Fuqua ('Training Day') has perfectly transformed Jake Gyllenhaal into a scary, muscular, bloodied monster of a fighter, who you would never want to step into the ring with.<br/><br/>Along with Kurt Sutter's ('Sons of Anarchy', 'The Shield') screenplay, this story of a prized fighter who loses it all and tries to get back on top is one you won't soon forget. Oddly enough, this film was supposed to be some sort of followup to '8 Mile' with Eminem playing the lead role, but Eminem chose to focus on his music career more than star in this film, which Gyllenhaal took over and did a phenomenal job. Gyllenhaal plays Billy Hope, the current Boxing Champion of the world who has never lost a fight. By his side since his humble beginnings from the orphanage he grew up in is his wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams), who is not only his lover and best friend, but also his manager.<br/><br/>The two live an ultra luxurious lifestyle on the outskirts of Manhattan with all the cars and toys you could ever want. Their lives are made better by their 11 year old daughter Leila (Oona Laurence). Billy Hope and his family are on top of the world. Even Billy's promoter and business manager (Curtis Jackson) seem to be making him more money and booking more fights for him, despite Maureen's pleas for him to retire so he can keep from getting injured seriously and be there more for Leila. Unfortunately, there is a terrible tragedy that leaves Billy homeless, penniless, and childless. One of the main flaws of the film is that Billy's downfall happens way too quickly.<br/><br/>He literally loses everything all at once, which doesn't make any sense, considering how wealthy he is. It seems like everyone has turned on Billy, and now he must try to be a better father in order to get his little girl out of the hands of the state. This is where he meets Tick Willis (Forest Whitaker), a local boxing coach in a bad neighborhood, who gives him a job cleaning up the gym after everyone leaves. When an opportunity arises to fight the current champ Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez), who is also responsible for Billy's downfall, Tick trains Billy for one last fight for the title.<br/><br/>This really isn't anything fresh or new story-wise, as we've seen this countless times before in other films, no matter what the sport is. However, with Sutter's script and Fuqua's brilliant eye for camera shots, this film seems brand new. Each performance is spot on. McAdams is fantastic and genuinely loves Billy, not just for his money and success, but for who he is, and it shows through McAdams's eyes and movements. Whitaker is also fantastic as the older crotchety boxing coach, who loves giving second chances.<br/><br/>But the real star here is Jake Gyllenhaal. I mean, you don't see Gyllenhaal on screen, you see a new person named Billy Hope. He's virtually unrecognizable as the muscular and bloodied, ferocious monster he becomes in the ring. When outside the ring, you see his nurturing side, which he is consistently trying to improve. Needless to say, his performance here definitely deserves an award. With fantastic fight sequences that will make you squirm, some great dramatic and emotional moments, as well as a score by James Horner and new songs from Eminem, 'Southpaw' is one film you should not miss."
"poe-48833","1","3","5","28 January 2016"," More schlocky than Rocky...
","Just for the record, Muhammad Ali was not a southpaw- yet, in the movie PHANTOM PUNCH, one of the worst boxing movies ever made, he IS. That's known as not paying attention to detail. In SOUTHPAW, the title character, although a ""southpaw,"" boxes from an orthodox stance, not a southpaw stance. Punchy Rocky Balboa was a southpaw who fought from a southpaw stance (far too often, in far too many movies, his head swelling to unbelievable proportions). In both SOUTHPAW and all 57 installments of ROCKY, the lead actors affect ""punchy"" attitudes and chew the scenery unmercifully (as bad in that respect as Paul Newman in SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME, yet another woefully miscast boxing movie)- though better the scenery than somebody's ears... As if all this weren't bad enough, we have HBO's ""boxing analysts"" babbling on at ringside (making SOUTHPAW the longest HBO advertisement ever made). This mega-melodrama is patently ridiculous and could only have been conceived by someone who doesn't know s--- about boxing (and watching Cinderella MAN doesn't count)- not to mention Dramatic Resolution (Was the murderer ever found out...? Not that I recall.). The reference to ""Night Train,"" the music Sonny Liston listened to while training, was, one supposes, some kind of half-a--ed ""in-joke,"" though it WAS good to see that Victor Ortiz has found himself another vocation. There are a number of Real Life Fighters who would make interesting subjects for a boxing movie: Jersey Joe Walcott (whose style I emulated more than any other when I fought), Jerry Quarry, Do Ku Kim, Alexis Arguello, Hector Camacho, Billy Collins, Ron Lyle, etc., but there's probably nobody who would even know where to begin with ANY of them. A boxing movie should focus as much on BOXING, its perfection and tactics, etc., as Martial Arts movies focus on the mastering of Martial Arts. (Which may be why we'll never see such a movie: What filmmaker has a legitimate GRASP of Boxing? NONE that I know of. The closest approximation would be Bruce Lee, who understood more about both hand to hand combat AND filmmaking than anyone before or since. Or perhaps EVER. It would've been interesting, indeed, to see what HE could've done with a boxing movie...) I've seen more in gyms than can be IMAGINED by most ""boxing writers."" I've seen amateurs fighting so fiercely that they knocked each other's headgear off (no easy task); I've seen guys get punched through the ropes to land on their head on hardwood floors; I've seen more teeth get knocked out than a dentist on his busiest day. From MY VIEW FROM THE CORNER by Angelo Dundee: ""He's on his own, out there in the loneliest spot in the world, the center of the ring, just him, the other guy, and the ref. And that other guy is there to hurt him and the ref can't help him..."" SOUTHPAW is just another (bad) example of somebody who doesn't really have a grasp of boxing cranking out crap that should never have seen the light of day. As a trainer once told me: ""Nobody goes fifteen rounds with the heavy bag and wins."" In boxing, there are no excuses, only results."
"cathaleoin1999","10","3","5","18 December 2015"," The most under-rated film of the year
","This film is a revelation. This year has been a revelation for boxing films. Both Southpaw and Creed have reinvigorated the genre to a place of excellence, and while Creed is getting the awards buzz and the attention, Southpaw is arguably the better film. Creed is brilliant, don't get me wrong, but Southpaw was just better. If you didn't smile when Billy knocked down Miguel in the last fight, or when Leila ran into his changing room post-fight, then you aren't human. The film also contains a lot of emotional acting which is usually seen in boxing films but not to this extent. The comeback of Billy Hope is as good as Rocky, so it's a shame to see this film slip under the radar. It still could get Oscar nods, but if every other award is to go by, Southpaw has been greatly misjudged, which is a terrible shame. The acting all-round is excellent. Jake Gyllenhaal's physical transformation is beyond impressive. It's a testament to the actor. While Sylvester Stallone is rightfully getting awards recognition for his reprisal of Rocky, Forest Whitaker is as good as Nick Nolte was in Warrior. With Nick getting an Oscar nod, the same could be said for Forest, but it seems Southpaw has been written off for awards, which is a shame as it belongs in the exact same boat as Creed. Both excellent films, they should both equally be getting recognition. Southpaw is the most under-rated film of the year purely because of Creed and Stallone's comeback to Rocky. This is the only reason why. If Creed were to have come out last year, or next year, then we would all be talking about Southpaw right now. End of"

","Jack Gyllenhaal was great as always and the topics that the story tackled were effective. One little problem was the little girl who plays the daughter. It gets pretty exploitative with her and at one point, she acts more like an emotional anchor than anything else which is always annoying. And if you've seen a lot of children in movies like I have, you'll know what I'm talking about. To its credit the little girl is actually a good actress and there is a touching and quiet moment with her and her dad that kinda makes up for it. I won't spoil anything but, the big issue that started the main characters downfall in the first place and the best that the plot could do was have the issue get settled in the fighting ring. WORST IDEA EVER. I feel kinda bad giving the film a 5. There was definitely a lot of good that this movie did but, you can't just ignore something that big!"

","Antoine Fuqua takes the best of other movies and makes them his own. Southpaw follows in the footsteps of classic boxing movies like Rocky, The Fighter and Warrior with its meaty, sensational fights, and The Shawshank Redemption and The Pursuit of Happiness, for making redemption its focal point. Jake Gyllenhaal seizes to amaze, outshining his work in Nightcrawler and Enemy. He's put himself through physical trauma to entertain at the highest level. Southpaw's an emotional journey, at its lowest when prestigious boxer Billy Hope (Gyllenhaal) loses his wife and the custody of his daughter. The shooting of Maureen Hope (Rachel McAdams) is one of the most terrifyingly real death in cinema history. Feelings run riot and a good deal of squirming in our seats transpires. Gyllenhaal's bulky frame, impressionable acting and connection with youngster Oona Laurence is mesmerising. The mid-section of Southpaw sees Hope fighting battles outside the ring, for his daughter by his side and to rid himself of the guilt he carries. Fuqua has upped the sentimentality, making Southpaw his most engaging film since Training Day. The ending dips in form into the pit when Billy makes his grand comeback, but this doesn't matter too much, as Hope, and Gyllenhaal for that matter, are mainly winners outside the ring."

","Even with its predictable plot throughout the entire film, it is well crafted thanks to the balanced mixed of its own drama and the bloody fist fighting sequences. While it offers nothing fresh, it is a production that leads audiences going through characters study, each and every consequences of their acts, as well as a journey to finding back the strength that has been masked by protagonist's self- centered behavior and arrogance. The main asset of the film is definitely Jake Gyllenhaal himself who has incredibly executing the bad tempered, brutal and depressing characteristics of Billy Hope. James Horner has done an amazing job in composing the scores which intensify the emotional engagement and dark moments faced by the characters especially in one of the impressive scene when Oona Laurence who played Leila blaming the fault of her dad. Other than the boxing theme, audiences might have seen the story for times but the inspiring messages such as we couldn't control everything in our lives and God always has a plan to teach us a lesson are worth for a watch."

Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't give a spectacular performance as per his pedigree, but he makes Billy Hope come alive. The role was originally intended for Eminem, and you can see Gyllenhaal channel him in every last nuance of his performance. Had Eminem taken the role, we'd be talking about his performance for years. Other performances are worth mentioning. Forrest Whitaker does a great job as the ""cranky old gym trainer"", and Rachel McAdams soars as Maureen Hope. Not to mention, Oona Laurence, turning in a magnificent performance as Leila.

","Raw emotion was the driving force throughout the story. Jake Gyllenhaal's transformation into Billy Hope was impressive. He conveyed the pain and despair that Hope was going through perfectly and was very believable as a pro boxer.<br/><br/>There is a particular scene while he is talking to his daughter at night in her room then steps out to head down the hallway that really is quite profound. When they are out of sight from one another and Gyllenhaal speaks briefly, the emotion and that particular moment and what it meant showcases pain in a way where the viewer can feel the stinging reality of it.<br/><br/>The darkest moments of the film were where it shined. These moments were extremely believable, and because of this, they were moments that viewers could relate to. If you know pain, which many do, one can recognize and feel the pain of another because pain in unambiguous. If you are able to feel the pain of Billy Hope, you can see yourself on screen and you know exactly how he is feeling and the context of that moment which can be a powerful moment for the viewer.<br/><br/>For those who are familiar with Sons of Anarchy and Kurt Sutter's work, there was a parallel where ""sins of the father"" comes into play where the child is thrust into the past of the parent. I think this again, played very well into the emotion of the film.<br/><br/>Give it a watch, but do so as a sponge absorbing the context and emotion of each scene.

And believe me, when you do watch this movie, it will touch you deep in the heart. Personally for me, it made me realize to be grateful for the people i have in my life, and that anything is possible if you just put your mind to it. It's definitely a great movie. Also, the cast is ""phenomenal"". Jake Gyllenhaal puts on a killer performance and so does Oona Laurence (Billy Hope's daughter). I strongly think that Jake Gyllenhaal overall is a such a unique and amazing actor. He has played a troubled teenage in Donnie Darko, a gay cowboy in Brokeback Mount., a Persian prince in Prince Of Persia, a scrawny cameraman in Nightcrawler, an enigmatic detective in Prisoners, a mad marine in Jarhead, and now a struggling boxer in Southpaw. Maybe this movie will be nominated for an Oscar."
"CleveMan66","8","4","8","25 July 2015"," ""Southpaw"" is fomulaic, but still packs a wallop.
","There's a moment every year when I see a film that signals to me that the Oscar race has begun. This is that moment and ""Southpaw"" (R, 2:03) is the film. Film studios and distributors regularly schedule their most prestigious releases for the last half of the year, so they will be fresher in the minds of members of various awards-sponsoring organizations when it comes time to nominate films for various accolades – and then reward them for excellence early in the new year. Those films that are perceived as the strongest award contenders are often held until the fall, or even the beginning of winter, but the flow of Oscar-bait has to start somewhere. I feel that this film is the first heavy hitter in the ring for 2015.<br/><br/>To garner year-end awards consideration, your film and/or its actors have to be especially good (obviously) – and it helps if your film has a good pedigree. This film is being distributed by the experienced Oscar-campaigning and Oscar-winning The Weinstein Company and was scored by the late multiple Oscar-winner James Horner. Director, Antoine Fuqua helped Denzel Washington to his Best Actor Oscar for ""Training Day"" (2001). This film's supporting cast includes Forest Whitaker, who won the Best Actor award at SAG, the Golden Globes and the Oscars for ""The Last King of Scotland"" (2003). The star of ""Southpaw"" is Jake Gyllenhaal, who was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005) and nominated for a Golden Globe (and many thought should have gotten an Oscar nomination) for Best Actor for his transformative performance in 2014's ""Nightcrawler"". Well, chalk up another transformative performance for Gyllenhaal, as the title character in ""Southpaw"", for which he'll almost certainly draw significant attention in the upcoming awards season. And he may not be the only one.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal gives what may be his most committed and most intense performance to date as Billy Hope, a light heavyweight champion boxer who gets too easily stuck in negative and harmful patterns. In the ring, his style is to allow himself to get savagely beaten in order to awaken the monster inside, a monster which, when unleashed on his opponent, always wins Billy the fight. And his manager (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) is always on hand to cheer him on and ask for more. Billy's beautiful wife (the excellent Rachel McAdams) supports him, but also worries about him and asks him to retire before it's too late for them to enjoy their lives with each other and with their daughter (an impressive Oona Laurence). In spite of his wife's pleadings, Billy's ways of dealing with things eventually cost his family dearly and Billy risks losing everything when his anger leads to increased drinking, drug use and other self-destructive behaviors.<br/><br/>When Billy hits his ""rock bottom"", the only other person who seems able to help him is former boxer, former trainer and current gym owner and supporter of at-risk youth Titus ""Tick"" Wills (Forest Whitaker, in possibly his finest performance since his Oscar win, and maybe his best ever). Billy finally sees for himself that if he is going to regain what he's lost, he has to change, and he eventually returns to boxing as a way to do that. As long as the odds are against him rebuilding his life, he comes to believe that he can do it. Even his name implies what eventually comes out of him (Billy Hope as in, William Hope as in, Will Hope). As with all boxing movies, the hard work that's required to be great and stay great (and maybe to become great again) is symbolic of the boxer's struggle to be the best person he can be. If Billy is able to get back into the ring, he will face a hungry young fighter (Miguel Gomez) who will do just about anything to win the title, but Billy's toughest opponent will always be himself.<br/><br/>""Southpaw"" is formulaic, but still packs a wallop. Fans of boxing movies (especially the ""Rocky"" movies) will recognize the basic story structure: A champion boxer fights through all manner of pain and injury to become and remain the champ. His loved ones worry about him. He considers retirement, but an up-and-coming fighter insists on his shot at the title, goading the champ in public and even insulting the champ's wife to get him to agree to a fight. The champ has to convince a reluctant old man to train him, but then resists the trainer's way of doing things. There is a training montage, and then a climactic fight. You've probably seen it before, but never quite like this. The only thing that these performances lack is a weak link, and the film itself is as real, rough and raw as you could ask for. ""A-"""

","So, its the third in a row and Fuqua maintains his pace and narration yet again. We all know Fuqua hardly makes movie for the critics he does it for the audience. But what makes Southpaw stand out is that it is in its limits. The sequences are not too dramatic though they are predictable. The plot is nothing more than what the trailer shows. But its always good to keep expectations low and deliver high and this film does exactly that. There have been so many boxing movies already and its a challenge for director to keep the audience engaged. Though a little slow at start, the movie picks up its pace with the character of Forest Whitaker. There are some really interesting conversation between Jake Gyllenhal and Forest Whitaker. The boxing sequences are well shot but its Eminem's Phenomenal track and other background score which gives the audience goosebumps and amps up the experience of this film.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is classic as troubled boxer Billy Hope. Rachel McAdams has a blink and a miss role and she looks beautiful while she is there. Forest Whitaker and Oona Laurence does justice to their characters. The other supporting characters doesn't have much to do in the movie. Yet again Fuqua proves one can make an engaging film without a strong script. Phenomenal."
"trublu215","8","5","11","15 July 2015"," Despite a familiar plot and character, Southpaw delivers the goods by way of Jake Gyllenhaal's ferocious performance.
","Southpaw marks Antoine Fuqua's take on the boxing film genre and it is a gritty, realistic take but the grittiness and realistic approach to this kind of film has been seen countless times. Despite this fact, Fuqua manages to deliver a film that hits all the right (if not familiar) beats all while giving Jake Gyllenhaal a chance to truly act his ass off. Billy Hope is a character that throws you right back to De Niro in Raging Bull and Stallone in Rocky. The performance is just as astonishing as his physical transformation into role. He takes Hope and makes this beast of a fighter human and makes the audience feel for him with every blow he takes, both in the ring and out of it. Rachel McAdams plays Maureen Hope, who unfortunately dies by way of accidental gunfire during an out of the ring confrontation between Billy and his rival. McAdams, while he part is small, it is so crucial. Despite her screen time being limited, McAdams' presence lingers throughout the entire film, making it impossible not to root for Billy even when he delves into street violence and drug abuse. A real stand out performance outside of Gyllenhaal is Oona Laurence who plays Leila Hope, Billy's young daughter. Laurence stands toe to toe with Gyllenhaal and delivers some of the best scenes in the film with her on-screen dad. She makes you cry, she makes you laugh, it is a great performance from a young actress and solidifies herself as a heavy hitter. While the performances in this film do push it pass the clichè scenes, there are still some underlying problems with Southpaw. The biggest is one that it can't shake and that is the plot itself. We've seen this story done many, MANY times before. Whether it is boxing or MMA, this is the same story as Rocky, Raging Bull, Warrior. A fighter fights for his family and pride. Kurt Sutter is a great writer and is grounded in reality but this is just too familiar of a plot to push this towards greatness. Fuqua, a former boxer, does a great job making this film feel like a documentary especially during the fights. They're not up close and personal like Raging Bull, they are shown like we're watching a HBO special on Ward and Gatti. It is delivered in real time but when blood is spilled and the wounds are heavy, Fuqua doesn't shy away and it makes for some truly grisly imagery. Overall, Southpaw is a powerful film thanks to its performances. However, if you're looking for a film that is a breath of fresh air, this is definitely not it."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","3","23 December 2015"," Grim Boxing Drama with Excellent Performances
","Southpaw (2015) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal completely transforms into boxer Billy Hope, a man who seems to have everything going for him until he loses it all in and outside of the ring. At his lowest level he meets trainer Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) and soon the two are using one another to try and gain back what they've lost.<br/><br/>SOUTHPAW comes from director Antoine Fuqua and is another crowd-pleaser for the filmmaker who certainly shows what he can do with such dark material. Let's get this out of the way right here. The biggest problem with SOUTHPAW is the fact that it's yet another boxing movie about a loser who gets everything only to find himself without it all and having to work his way back. The entire redemption aspect in boxing movies has been seen since the silent days and they continued through every decade. It really is true that if you've seen one boxing movie then you've pretty much seen them all.<br/><br/>With that said, there's no question that boxing movies continue to be made because director-actor combos see the beauty in their stories. I mean, who doesn't like a tale of redemption and comeback? We like to see our heroes take a tumble so that they have to be normal again and fight to get everything back. Fuqua does some of the greatest direction of his career because this is a brutally grim movie. The entire film has an overcast over it, which just makes it seem so gloomy and dark but how the director pulls this off is very impressive. It's not a fun film and there's more depression than anything else but we can identify with the main character no matter how much we might not like about him.<br/><br/>Of course, the reason an actor would be interested in a boxing movie is because it would let him play so many different ranges. Gyllenhaal is simply terrific here as he pulls off the white trash role with perfection and there's no question that he handles the physical aspect. He obviously got into terrific shape for the film and he certainly makes you believe that he's a boxer and not just some actor playing a part. Whitaker is also very good in the supporting role as is Rachel McAdams and Curtis Jackson. Oona Laurence is also impressive in the role of the daughter.<br/><br/>SOUTHPAW features a very good soundtrack, terrific sound effects and some great cinematography. As I said, we've seen this type of boxing melodrama countless times over the years but the film has a unique atmosphere and certainly a great performance that makes it worth viewing."

","This was in my book the best movie of 2015, and the year isn't even over yet. Yes, that's how good i believe this movie is. The performance given by Jake Gyllenhaal and Rachel McAdams was astounding. I rated this movie a 10 out of 10 because it is completely worthy of it! Mr. Gyllenhaal was able to transform himself into a completely different person for this movie. Showing why he is such an incredible actor, and played the role as it was intended to be played. The film tugged at the viewers emotions throughout the entire movie, making you feel sad, mad, disappointed and happy. Although like I said before, the year is not over yet, but I believe that this movie was so good that nothing else that comes out this year can top it. I will be waiting the see both Jake and Rachel walk up and accept an award for such great performances."

"Benslie","9","1","1","12 February 2019"," This isn't just a boxing movie but a movie about redemption
","First of all, I love the underlining themes of this film. Yes, this film is a boxing film but it's one of those films where you have to watch it to get the deeper meaning behind it. One of the meanings is that you have to lose once in a while to get better. Billy has to change from when we first see him at the beginning of the film to the last time. Which is another reason why I love this film is the character development in this film. Billy doesn't stay the same from beginning to end. No, he has to change in order to get his life back together and you see that not just instantly but over the period of the film. I also really liked the pacing in this film. None of the scenes felt rushed or slowed down at any point. They all felt like the speed it should be going at for a movie like this. But I can't say the same about the transitions in this film. Some of them were awkward and took away from the emotion in that scene. The acting in this film was spectacular as well. Which ties in well with the emotion because all the actors and actresses easily showed the proper emotion that was supposed to be seen at that moment. When a character was upset or angry you could easily see it in their facial expression and body language. But obviously I knew Jake Gyllenhaal was going to be good in this film but somebody who shocked me was Oona Laurence, who plays Leila Hope. She acted way beyond somebody her age and she could easily steal the scene from any of the adults and I hope she has a great career in the future. In the end, this film isn't just a boxing film but a movie about how you have to lose once in a while to change and grow as a person."

","Lets be honest, there are a number of boxing movies preceeding this one. The entire Rocky series for instance. Because of that, I see that alot of the reviews are touting that this movie feels formulaic. I would agree insofar as there are some cool montage scenes meant to get the viewer fired up. However, the difference here is that the music is much more modern as opposed to 'Eye of the Tiger'. Outside of that, I was thoroughly impressed by the directing and action scenes.<br/><br/>Speaking about the movie as a whole, I was completely floored. McAdams' death was so traumatic that I literally had to stop watching for a few minutes. It is impossible not to feel heartbroken at the grief and anguish Gyllenhaal carries afterwards. As his life is turned upside down, the viewer is left to contemplate how they themselves would cope with the emotional turmoil of having their loved ones violently taken from them. His subsequent self destruction is a fear at the core of every human that has suffered the loss of a bond as strong as love.<br/><br/>Whether you're a boxing fan or not, you will enjoy this movie. Its message reminds us all that no matter what happens, we need to keep fighting for ourselves and our loved ones. For me, Billy Hope has become a new icon of perseverance. Don't be surprised if you find yourself yelling at the TV or physically reacting to certain scenes.<br/><br/>That all having been said. the reason that this movie gets an 8 and not higher is very simple.. McAdams' death was unnecessary. Dont get me wrong, the whole movie is centrifugal around this particular plot development. However, if you review the movie chronologically, you will see that Escobar wanted to fight Hope and the feeling was mutual prior to the ensuing tragedy. 50 Cent (Curtis Jackson) turns down the fight which eventually leads to an altercation wherein Escobar is taunting Hope. All of this makes sense, however the part where Billy's wife gets shot in the altercation does not. Was it intentional? Was it an accident? Was 50 cent in on it? We never even really find out what happens to the shooter. As twisted as it sounds, the movie would be even more compelling if the death was targeted. Given the impact it has on the movie, more details surrounding the reason and aftermath of McAdams' death would have provided more closure."

","People have slated this movie because the basic storyline has been done before, boxer is on top, loses everything and hits rock bottom, reinvents himself and gets back on top. Yes the storyline may have been done a few times before, but there's a reason for that and its simple, it makes for a good story and it works, and Southpaw does it very well. Jake Gyllenhaal is nothing short of a revelation as Billy Hope who goes through every human emotion possible as his ideal life is shattered and he has to pick up the pieces. Although her role was very brief Rachel McAdams likewise turned in a brilliant performance as Maureen and as is Oona Laurence as daughter Leila whose world is turned upside down by event not of her own making. Forrest Whittaker as trainer father figure and mentor Tick Wills was superb, and 50 Cents as your stereotypical boxing promoter did the job solidly enough. Miguel Gomez as the antagonist likewise turns in a surprisingly good performance as someone who wants what the protagonist has. The boxing scenes were really well done and were authentic thanks to the use of the HBO announcers and Jimmy Lennon Jr. To summarise Southpaw does have a plot which has been done before but it does it very well and thanks to the acting, the movie is worth watching and owning."

","Boxing drama Southpaw (2015) hit silver screen in Australia last night.<br/><br/>Regardless how tough you may be, during over two hours of Southpaw movie, emotions and bugs are all over you and basically ripping you apart. Toughness has nothing to do with the muscles when it comes to living your life aspects.<br/><br/>The plot of the picture is very simple, it is all about ordinary life. Involvement of boxing simply generates that comparison, clearly demonstrating that very thin line between toughness and weakness.<br/><br/>Hope Dies Last<br/><br/>One of the taglines of Southpaw movie is ""Never Give Up Hope"". It obviously reflects on the last name of the main character Billy Hope. However there is much more deeper meaning behind it.<br/><br/>The definition of both ""life"" and ""live"" is obviously about people. It is also always about other people, those important for you. So basically when you lose a person from your life, but this person is still in ""life"", there is always hope to get this person back in your life, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>The hope dies together with that person. Simply saying when that person is gone, there is no more hope to get anything back in (to) ""life"". This is when the responsibility on the third person comes into action. It is very important to take that responsibility. The responsibility that drives you and not letting to give up.<br/><br/>You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed<br/><br/>The drama in Southpaw starts when Hope looses his better half. It develops into a more difficult situation when the system is taking his daughter away from him. The one, he is responsible on. The way that renowned system works we all know quite well. This is also and always a human factor which this system is made of – made by different people.<br/><br/>I believe, the responsibility on others is the only thing which keeps all of us going. Prove me wrong when you find a happy person who has all of the ""materialistic features"", but nobody to bring him a glass of water, and not because they are paid for doing it, but because they care and responsible on this person.<br/><br/>Hurt, But Never Defeated<br/><br/>Southpaw movie demonstrates the power of the will. It clearly shows that there is always a certain way to come out victorious. This way – is to do what you've been always doing the best. In the movie it is boxing, which is easy to put as an example, with the ""winning inside the ring"" feeling of being a champion. But in fact – it can be anything. This is where the new plan is not applicable.<br/><br/>Plans Never Work<br/><br/>One of the scenes in Southpaw is when they are talking about the next step. Hope mentions that it has never been him drawing those plans. It has been always his wife, who is now gone. Being lost, but responsible he, though, finds the way. The way I've just mentioned above – he does what he does best.<br/><br/>One man, no man<br/><br/>There is an old Russian saying which is translated in English as ""There is safety in numbers"", or maybe a closer definition will be ""One man, no man"". Basically it means that we all need help. This is where Hope finds that needed person, the trainer, who helps him dot the i's and cross the t's. This how it is always in life – you meet people with the same spirit as you, combining together a Win Team.<br/><br/>Love, Hope, Believe<br/><br/>Everything done because of love – is always beautiful. Simply because love is the most beautiful feeling. About hope I have just written above. So finally, when it comes to believe in love, never giving up on hope featuring doing what you do best – this is that required plan.<br/><br/>Keep living your life, cause it's your time<br/><br/>If the hope faded away with that person, which is obviously not under your control, – you have to let it go. You must success because you are responsible on those who need you.<br/><br/>If there is hope – you must prove wrong if you really believe that you are ""The King"".<br/><br/>History Repeats. Always<br/><br/>I believe any top athlete, celebrity, ""the king"" basically any of us can apply this Southpaw movie life story on ourselves. It is known that higher you get, worse it hurts when you fall. You like it or not, the falling aspect is always on the books. Life is a very balanced thing.<br/><br/>Injured, Hurt, with a horrific Loss but still the champ<br/><br/>The Southpaw movie itself is the top Hollywood production. It has all necessary features and characters to demonstrate the reality of life and everything involved. Em was right, saying ""everybody smashed it."" I, believe, am right, saying you must watch it.<br/><br/>After the movie, we've kind of laughed on the way back home, that us fighters who get kicked and elbowed on the daily basis, have almost dropped into tears, while watching the picture. This is how emotional and true story the Southpaw movie is. It does touch your heart and makes you think."

"leonblackwood","7","1","1","3 December 2015"," An emotional movie with some real boxing scenes. 7/10
","Review: I quite enjoyed this emotional movie and I definitely think that Jake Gyllenhaal should be up for an Oscar for his amazing transformation. The storyline did seem to drag after a while but I couldn't wait for the big showdown at the end. Anyway, Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) seems to have it all, with his big mansion, beautiful wife and loving daughter, and when the lightweight boxer wins all of the championship belts, life really can't get any better for this man who struggled through his childhood. He then gets invited to a charity event were he gives a speech about his life and his love for his wife, Maureen Hope (Rachel McAdams) but his whole life changes when a gun is fired during a punch up with his arch-rival, Miguel ""Magic"" Escobar (Miguel Gomez). The shot, mistakingly hits his wife, who dies on the spot, which leaves a distraught Billy Hope, to bring up his daughter Leila Hope (Oona Laurence). Whilst trying to defend his title, he basically gives up fighting against his opponent and he ends up head-butting the referee out of shear frustration. Now that he's lost his title, it defaults a 3 fight deal that he has with a television company and he's being sued for the head-butting incident. With his debts piling up and his boxing career in tatters, he turns to drink and drugs for comfort and the depression from losing his wife, starts to take its toll. He then ends up in hospital after crashing his car into a tree, so the child protection agency are brought in, because they found drink and drugs in his body while he was driving. A judge decides to put Leila into care while Billy sorts his life out, so he sells his house to clear up his debts and he gets a job in a gym, which he also uses to train. After much persuasion, he manages to get the gym owner, Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) to train him in his own unique way, which will improve his boxing skills but his daughter refuses to see him because she blames him for being in care. He then gets a chance to box in a charity bash, we're he shows of his new boxing style and impresses his old manager, Jordan Mains (50 Cent), who is now managing Escobar. He offers him a chance to return to the big league by challenging Escobar to a championship bout but he only has 6 weeks to train and to get in shape. As he desperately needs the money to get his daughter back, he goes through some gruesome training with Tick and he manages to build a relationship with his daughter again. With his new trainer by his side and his daughter back in his life, he uses every muscle in his body to fight against the man who was involved in the murder of his wife. I really enjoyed the intensity during boxing fights and the emotional scenes with his daughter. Jakes anger issues were performed extremely well and the love that he had for his wife was really sweet, just like Rocky with Adrian but I did find it a bit predictable. Personally, I'm surprised that they didn't pick 50 Cent to play the boxer because of his physique and hard man mentality! Anyway, I enjoyed this movie and the hero to zero to hero again, concept was well put together by the director. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Although the critics had great things to say about this film, when it was released, it's still not the type of film that you can watch time and time again like the early Rocky movies. Its not that it isn't a quality film, it's just that it's not a feel good movie were you start punching the air when you come out of the cinema. The personal issues that Jake's character is going through are extremely deep and you do have to be in the right mood to watch it. With that aside, the performances are top class from the whole cast, especially Jake Gyllenhaal, 34, who really hit the mainstream in 2001, when he starred in Donnie Darko. Since then, he has covered many genres in movies like the big budget The Day After Tomorrow, Jarhead, Brokeback Mountain, Rendition, Zodiac, Brothers, Prince of Persia, Love & Other Drugs, Source Code, the brilliant End of Watch, Prisoners, Enemy and Nightcrawlers. With Everest and Demolition due to be released soon and 5 movies in the pipeline which includes the Current War with Benedict Cumberbatch and Okja with Bill Nighy and Tilda Swinton, he really has proved that he can completely transform his acting style, like he did in this film and in End of Watch. Anyway, this movie was directed by Antoine Fuqua, 49, who has quite a impressive portfolio to date. Titles to his name include, the Replacement Killers, Bait with Jamie Foxx, Training Day, Tears of the Sun with Bruce Willis, King Arthur with Clive Owen and Kiera Knightley, Shooter with Mark Wahlberg, Brooklyn's Finest, Olympus Must Fall and the Equalizer. Judging by his previous movies, it's not surprising how committed Antoine was, to this project and I must admit, the boxing scenes did seem extremely real. He also got the best out of Gyllenhaal, so I have to give him props for making a memorable film which touched many emotional heart strings.<br/><br/>Budget: $30million Worldwide Gross: $91million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/drama/sports movies starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Rachel McAdams, Forest Whitaker, 50 Cent and Naomie Harris. 7/10"

","The movie has its moments. There are good and bad scenes. There are good and not so good actors. There are good and bad ideas. I wouldn't kill the wife, for example. Too dramatic. That was totally avoidable. Forest whitaker is a hell of an actor. Loved. Jack G. wasn't as good as in nightcrawler. He performs far more better as a psycho than as a bad boy, obviously in my opinion.The fight scenes weren't that good also. All the Rocky saga is far more better. I also expected another reaction for the main character after the death of her wife, towards vengeance or at least that the final fight would be more dramatic and tense, but no. That didn't happen. I liked the story about the relationship between father and child very much. To me, that's the best part of the film."
"quincytheodore","7","1","1","5 October 2015"," Proving that old routine, when delivered properly, can still be a knockout.
","There's a simple combo in boxing called ""one-two"", which is a jab followed by a cross, it's a basic move familiar to boxers. Southpaw has the same essence, you might see it coming, yet the production and acting are amazing, it still makes for an effective spectacle. Jake Gyllenhaal especially has produced one of his most engaging performances, it's no understatement that the film rests on his shoulder and he carries with beyond mediocrity.<br/><br/>Story is admittedly unoriginal. It's a boxer's struggle to get his life together after an incident, one has seen this premise in Rocky and practically many other similar movies. A bit difference is it opens when Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) is on the peak of his career. Usually, boxing movie doesn't depict much what happens during or after the big fights, so the slight chance in direction is welcomed.<br/><br/>What follows is pretty much expected journey of self-discovery through much hardship. There's so much focus on Jake Gyllenhaal and he doesn't disappoint in the slightest. His boxer persona is ridden with rage, occasionally socially awkward and pretty much unable to cope. It's these flaws that made him identifiable and halfway through audience would root for him like it's an actual title fight.<br/><br/>Other cast like Forest Whitaker, Curtis Jackson and the little Oona Laurence bring the story together. Granted, each represents a stereotype, but the relationships, either it's dysfunctional or platonic serves Billy's character development very well. The father-daughter bond is impressively done, it's the best family display after Matthew McConaughey's Interstellar.<br/><br/>There are a few flaws though. Some of the plot devices feel forced as though it for the sake of setting the scenario and the antagonists are excessively vilified. However, there's a degree of effort to make this a legitimate boxing film. Details such as the technical aspects, preparation and life style are present, boxing fans wouldn't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Southpaw is, objectively, an overused story, but the energy from production and brilliant performance by Jake Gyllenhaal are so infectiously inspiring and uplifting."
"AverxgeJoe","5","1","1","5 October 2015"," Yes and no
","Southpaw reminds me of Fury. That's because, both movies tell stories that have already been told before. I have more or less seen Southpaw even before watching it, just with different cast and directors.<br/><br/>I don't have anything against that by default. IMO same or similar stories to each other can be told as many times as long as they entertain the viewer again. For example, Fury was very generic and clichéd, but it had some good moments of it's own and it kept me entertained.<br/><br/>Southpaw was generic and clichéd as well, but the truly great moments lacked.<br/><br/>The feels the movie tried to push at me felt far too artificial. When the protagonist Billy Hope's wife Maureen died, it was too soon and it didn't have an impact on me. It was so artificial, cause obviously I will feel sorry for the guy, because his wife died, but solely because she was his wife. The movie didn't make me feel anything in regards of her character. I barely even got to know her.<br/><br/>Billy's progress through the movie was too superficial and didn't make me feel anything below the surface. That's why the ending felt stale, even though it should have been a happy moment.<br/><br/>So story wise the movie is a big no no. But the acting from Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing. For what it's worth his performance made me watch the movie till the end. Rachel McAdams was lacking and she wasn't even in the movie for that long. Forest Whitaker wasn't even close to what he was in The Last King of Scotland, but he was still fine. And Naomie Harris surprised me! She was great in a small role.<br/><br/>The score did get on my nerves sometimes, the piano was nice, but the string instruments went too far at times. Music was used quite copiously even when dialogue was going on, or at least it felt like it. I wasn't a fan of that.<br/><br/>So a plus for the acting and a minus for the rest of the movie."

"estebangonzalez10","Null","1","1","7 September 2015"," Jake ""The Great"" Gyllenhaal defeats genre conventions
","""Billy Hope knows how to take a punch, but he also drops bombs.""<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua's third film in the same amount of years may not be as exciting as last year's The Equalizer, but it does benefit from having one of the best performance's of the year. Jake Gyllenhaal's commitment to the role is reason enough to recommend the movie and forgive some of its generic dramatic flaws. Training Day still remains Fuqua's best film, but Gyllenhaal's physical transformation gives Denzel Washington some competition here for best performance in a Fuqua film. When the film focuses on the boxing scenes it is at the top of its game, but when it stretches the drama towards the family dynamics it loses its appeal by feeling too conventional and melodramatic. Fuqua was aiming at directing an authentic film and stylistically it succeeds, but the beats are way too familiar and it's full of clichés. What I loved about the realism in the boxing scenes is that Fuqua created a sense of illusion for the audience of being a ringside spectator, as the sound of the fans cheering drowned down the voice of the TV commentators giving us a sense of witnessing the event from up close. Despite his efforts to make the film look authentic, boxing fans know that the sport isn't as exciting as they made it out to be here. Gyllenhaal got all the right moves and mannerisms for his character, but we know there aren't as many punches thrown in real life and that most of the rounds are spent with the referee trying to break up the fighters from hugging each other so much. Gyllenhaal saves this film from the familiar melodrama and clichés found in the genre, which just goes on to prove how difficult it is to do what Stallone did with the Rocky franchise. That was one of the rare cases where both the drama and the sport combined perfectly to deliver an emotional punch to audiences around the globe. I think Fuqua was aiming a bit too high here trying to direct a modern day version of Raging Bull, but there are just some films that can't be imitated no matter what great of a cast you have. <br/><br/>This was writer Kurt Sutter's first film screenplay, despite having written for successful TV shows such as The Shield and Sons of Anarchy prior to this. He begins the story by introducing us to boxer, Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal), as he is in the locker room getting prepared for his fight. His wife, Maureen (Rachel McAdams), who has been with him since the two were young teenagers, is next to him as the trainers are giving him the last instructions and putting on his gloves. When his name is called by the announcers we find out that he is the undefeated champion in his division and has accumulated more than 40 wins. The arena is packed and everyone is chanting his name, but the fight doesn't begin as well as he had hoped. After receiving several punches throughout the first rounds, Hope finally reacts and knocks his opponent out in the tenth round. The media goes crazy over him during the press conference after the fight where he is once again accompanied by Maureen and his promoter, Jordan Mains (50 Cent). The conference is interrupted by Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez), a young upcoming contender who wants his shot at the title, but he is dismissed by Billy. When he finally returns to his beautiful home, Billy gives his young daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) a goodnight kiss and cuddles with her for a while. Everything seems perfect for him, but his life crumbles when his wife is killed in a tragic accident and for the first time in his life he doesn't have someone there guiding him in his every move. His suicidal and erratic behavior makes him lose everything including the house and his daughter who is sent to child protection services. After touching bottom and in order to get his life back on track, Billy enlists the help of Tick Willis (Forest Whitaker) who takes him in to his gym and begins training him for his shot at redemption.<br/><br/>The plot is way too familiar and it hits every possible cliché along the way, but despite it all Jake Gyllenhaal elevates the material by making his character compelling. I didn't believe some of the melodramatic moments, but the boxing and training scenes were enough for me to enjoy it. The film puts a lot of emphasis on the father and daughter relationship and it isn't always believable how easy it goes from a love hate relationship from one scene to the next. There are also several subplots that distract from the main story and slow down the pacing of the film. For instance, the relationship Billy builds with one of the kids in Tick's gym only serves as a way for us to sympathize with the main protagonist and believe in his transformation, but it doesn't go anywhere else with it. The film introduces several scenes like this as a convenient means to move along the story, but they don't add up too much. You know exactly where the story is heading at the end, but you can't help but feel engaged by Gyllenhaal's performance, and in the end he is the reason why the film succeeds along with other solid supporting work from McAdams and Whitaker. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","First of all...this is wrong, why i have to write in English only, i want to write in Spanish, i don't have that right???. OK, going to the point that matters...the movie is extraordinary whether you are a boxer, whether you where a boxer or if you don't even know what boxing is, like someone says down here. I watch it in the night, and the next morning when i woke up i was feeling so weird (like in a good way i think). It provoke on mi something very difficult to describe. It touches my most intimate fiber, it came with a strong emotional charge. Although I understand that not everyone feels the same way, you never, NEVER can put 1,2,3, or 4 stars to this movie...they are qualifications to fit in Aladdin movie, don't be cruel, don't be like that, don't be that guy, think, with that qualifications the movie rate falls apart. The actor are really exceptional...Mcadams is great truly great, although she participates in the first part her essence will remain with you all the way. Forest...there is nothing to say about him that someone doesn't know, the way that he adopts that kind of character is beautiful. And Gyllenhaal is becoming one of my favorites really, he is truly magnificent. It can't be bad with persons who work in this level. Watch it please, y cannot take it out of my head, i repeat, at least for my as a boxing fan that i am, it left me with a mix of emotions that only few movies have provoke that on my.

"DoubleOscar","7","5","12","21 July 2015"," Gyllenhaal Elevates This Formulaic Boxing Movie Above Most Others
","I got to see an advanced screening of Southpaw tonight at my local AMC. I was highly anticipating this movie mainly because I was blown away last year with Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler and was eager to see how he would play the short-tempered, completely ripped Billy Hope.<br/><br/>The story is as expected. Gyllenhaal's Billy Hope is at the top of his game and he has everything he wants. However, a series of events occur that causes Billy Hope's life to crumble around him until he has nothing left. From there he must fight his way back to the top to reclaim his former glory. It sounds like a familiar story line and that's because it is, but it is executed very well and acted superbly that it makes the film seem fresh.<br/><br/>To continue with the acting, every performance in this film is terrific and the actors play well off one another. While Gyllenhaal is the obvious standout, others like Forest Whitaker and Rachel McAdams perform their roles with such brilliance that it just elevates Gyllenhaal's role and the film even more.<br/><br/>As for problems, obviously being a formulaic movie comes with a fair share of predictability. Also, there are moments where the film becomes a tad bit heavy handed in its approach to what the audience should be feeling. However, there is nothing glaring that completely takes away from the enjoyment that is to be had with Southpaw.<br/><br/>Lastly, a mention must be made for James Horner's score. It was fantastic and really improved every scene, whether the audience was supposed to feel sympathetic, sorrow, or joyful. RIP<br/><br/>Overall, Southpaw not only showcases the acting abilities of its entire cast, it tells an excellent redemption story with Billy Hope. Let's hope this is the role that gets Gyllenhaal recognized for not only his performance, but his transformation as well.<br/><br/>""You should see the other guy"""
"scottshak_111","7","4","9","5 August 2015"," Jake creates a new boxer Billy Hope....A clichéd tale made powerful by acting prowess!
","Antoine Fuqua's latest venture isn't huge or the next best thing in a series of boxing movies we have seen so far. He had a clichéd script with him which he tried to weave into a movie. So what works in his favour and how did he manage to pull it off? The answer – Jake Gyllenhaal. Period.<br/><br/>You can almost read the tenacity in Jake's eyes, the commitment in his body and the way he pulls anything off. He has gone pro in acting and he wears every skin endeavoring to erase his name, to don a character so brilliantly that people forget the guy under the skin. He creates a new personality altogether that walks, moves and talks differently.<br/><br/>Whitaker does a pretty good job as a trainer. Drama isn't that great but manages to pull through, at times visiting sentient frames. The movie misses out on imparting gravity to characters like Jordan Mains, Hoppy, Jon Jon etc. who work as mere backdrops to the badass Billy Hope. Escobar played by Miguel Gomez disappears like noise too, since he fails to properly unfurl his limited time perversion.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD: Some of the badass bits that are worth noticing are – when the flick begins in rad pizazz with Hope listening to music whilst getting wrist wrapped. Ample time is spent on the beginning act which looks pretty dope. Also the aftermath of Billy losing Maureen has been shot pretty nicely. The father-daughter relationship that goes sour has been properly depicted by both Jake and Oona's acting prowess. The boxing matches are pretty great to watch. Thrilling and the way it should be – natural.<br/><br/>Southpaw loses out on intensity. The story is quite clichéd and the screenplay doesn't raise brows. At the end of it becomes nothing but mediocre. If it weren't for Jake Gyllenhaal's awesome acting, the movie could have simply passed as yet another boxing movie where the actor is bent on seeking redemption.<br/><br/>Go watch it if you love boxing, or Jake."
"mahirehman","7","3","6","31 August 2015"," An emotional and heartfelt movie about emotional and physical pain but also finding redemption and perseverance along the way.
","This movie is undoubtedly vigorous and impactive. Powerful performances by Jake Gyllenhaal as Billy Hope, Oona Laurence as Leila Hope and Rachel Mcadams as Maureen Hope. These combined actors are able to convey a fantastically emotional story about Billy Hope fighting the urge to not allow his anger control him as it previously got the best of him. This led to the death of his long-term friend and wife Maureen Hope. The result of Maureen's death leads to Billy spirally out of control to the point where he tries to commit suicide by crashing his car with extreme speed into a tree nearby the family home. The repercussions of his impulsiveness leads to him losing temporal custody of his daughter, Leila. Billy makes a remarkable and positive change by getting a job at a boxing gym. Billy gradually shows good signs of being able to take care of his daughter again as he controls his anger and is supporting himself.However, Leila holds too much anger towards her father as she blames him for her mother's death. This scene is among one of the best throughout the movie as Leila hits her father and cries that he should of died instead of her mother. Billy understands his daughter needs to heal and continues to fight for her, literally by training to fight his opponent Miguel 'Magic' Escobar played by Miguel Gomez, that caused the escalation and death of Maureen. Redemption, familial love and perseverance is found at the end of the story as Leila and Billy try to heal themselves and focus on caring about one another and not letting boxing consume their lives again. <br/><br/>Overall this movie takes us on a journey to care, hate and sympathise with the characters. Billy shows great strength emotionally and physically by conquering his anger issues and focuses on doing good with his skills of boxing. This movie has proved to be an emotional roller coaster as the audience are able to relate to the emotions of what each character is feeling especially due to the circumstances they are put through. <br/><br/>A beautiful piece."

His fall isn't exactly believable and there's not as much depth as you would expect in terms of character.

","'Southpaw' follows the undefeated Billy Hope, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, on his road to redemption both both in and outside of the ring. The narrative also arcs around Hope's personal life between his daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) and wife (Rachel Mcadams.) This is another physical demanding role for Gyllenhaal in comparison to my favourite performance of his in last years thriller 'Nightcrawler.' Where it falls short of the brilliance of 'Nightcrawler' is its overall script. It is riddled with predictability, although it 's attempts to shun this aren't unnoticed.<br/><br/>By definition, the boxing drama Southpaw is a good boxing movie. Is it a superb film all around? No, I fail to see how this will get a Best-Picture nomination. The falling grace to the drama is Gyllenhaal's overall performance. Year on year he simply becomes a different person and 'Southpaw' is no exception. His emotional scenes with his equally talented daughter are believable, gaining instant catharsis. Where Gyllenhaal is at his bitter best is inside the ring. From the offset the weight gain is noticed and needed for his performance to be as raw as Hope's ruthless characteristics. Hope felt he had to be hit repeatedly to be feel his most comfortable in the ring (reminiscent of 'Raging Bull'). The cinematography for both the major boxing scenes of the start and the final scene are probably the most gripping parts of the scenes. Just before the film was announced it was revealed that the camera crew were utilising HBO cameramen to make the fights feel both raw and real. Moreover from the central performance, Forest Whitaker's best performance in years as Hope's coach-'Tick.' It's also noteworthy that 50 cents performance was mediocre at best. It felt that anyone could of easily played his role.<br/><br/>Where the film falls from grace is its chiches, despite some being done correctly. 'Southpaw' follows Billy's typical roles (The Rise, Fall, Pity and Revenge Trip.) There's point when I was nodding my head the amount of times I have seen this scenes before. The one I distinctly remember is the montage training scene, utilising Eminem's soundtrack it was hard for me to still feel bitter when I was still anxious towards Hope's journey.<br/><br/>The main problem that 'Southpaw' left itself was gained from the offset. The trailer revealed a major reveal that really did not need to be shown to its audience. I felt I was just waiting for this scene to occur so I could probably watch the felt with a sense of a apprehensiveness. It's hard to downgrade the film based on something that meanwhile it is hard to forget."

","'SOUTHPAW': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal, one of the greatest actors of his generation (or any), stars in this boxing drama flick, directed by Antoine Fuqua (the man responsible for such gritty crime thrillers as 'TRAINING DAY', 'BROOKLYN'S FINEST' and 'THE EQUALIZER'). It was written by Kurt Sutter; a TV writer, known for writing several episodes of such popular crime dramas as 'THE SHIELD' and 'SONS OF ANARCHY' (which he also created). The film tells the story of a champion boxer, who desperately fights to get his life back on track; after his wife is killed and he loses his daughter to child protection services. It costars Forest Whitaker, Rachel McAdams, Oona Laurence, 50 Cent, Naomie Harris and Miguel Gomez. The movie also features the final music score of the late James Horner; who worked for free, and the film is dedicated to. The soundtrack also features multiple songs by Eminem, who was originally set to star in the movie (reprising his role from '8 MILE'). The film hasn't received the best reviews from critics; but it's a sports movie classic, and it has to be seen by any true movie lover.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal plays a professional boxer named Billy Hope; who's recently retired from the sport, after winning the World Light Heavyweight championship. His manager, Jordan Mains (50 Cent), wants him to keep fighting, and an extremely arrogant up-and-coming boxer, Miguel 'Magic' Escobar (Gomez), desperately wants to fight him. His wife, Maureen (McAdams), wants him to stay at home, at their house in New York City, with her and their young daughter Leila (Laurence). Everything changes though, when Maureen is killed in a tragic accident; and Billy starts abusing drugs and alcohol, to cope. He eventually turns to a veteran boxer, Titus Wills (Whitaker), for help. <br/><br/>I love Jake Gyllenhaal (he's my second favorite male actor right now), I also really like boxing movies and Antoine Fuqua films (to varying degrees). This flick is definitely no 'ROCKY', but it's still a classic (all the same); screw the critics. The movie is pretty dark, but at least it's not filled with sappy and overly clichéd melodrama; like a lot of critical darlings. It's emotional and inspiring, despite it's tragic moments, and Gyllenhaal gives one of the best performances of the year (yet again). Fuqua may not be one of the most talented directors around, but he knows how to deliver a film like this; and Sutter's script is brilliant. It's definitely not a perfect movie but it's still one not to be missed.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/2GU4GdpLvIk"
"Quinoa1984","6","3","6","26 July 2015"," phenomenal cast in a lackluster script
","Southpaw has noble enough ambitions: a story of a man who is on top (but probably, just more than a bit, arrogant at his current position) with a wife and kid who love him and he right back, and (no) thanks to a very tragic accident (wife dies) he finds himself at rock bottom and has to crawl back up to the top, on his own terms. Oh, and it's a boxing movie, so it has the rags to riches then back to rags and maybe some riches again type of arc, 'and with the sort of vibe that comes from the ""streets"". I put that in quotes as I can't say for sure whether it fully represents it or not; I have to think it does, being that Southpaw was originally meant as a vehicle for Eminem (who now has the theme song ""Phenomenon"", which is kind of obnoxious frankly) and is directed by Antoine Fuqua, who made one of the superb 'street' thrillers several years back with Training Day.<br/><br/>What you get as the most positive thing with Southpaw are the performances. Every actor here is putting in more than their work-load, from Rachel McAdams to her one act (from the poster you might think she'll be in it longer, but the trailer gives it away and it's not so much a twist as it is just that sudden turn to the story's conflicts), to Oona Lawrence as Billy (Jake Gyllenhaal) Hope's daughter - she is a seriously wonderful child actress, on par with all of her fellow actors, and really delivering on what she is asked to do, but giving a little something extra. And of course there's the Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker playing the role of the beleaguered no-BS-not-quite-but-really-Mickey-from-Rocky trailer. They're all good here. Hell, even 50 Cent has some good scenes.<br/><br/>What you get as not so good is the script. I know a lot of passion went into this project, and I have to think Kurt Sutter went into this with his heart hanging out in the air. Unfortunately his book-of-clichés gets laid bare as well; we know where this train is headed the moment that Billy Hope actually wins the first fight in the movie; he is clearly TOO much at an advantage, though clearly flawed as a fighter, as well, in some small part as a father. Again, the actors help fill in some of the gaps, but I never felt or saw like these characters really had interesting lives outside of what the plot was requiring them to do. It doesn't help that Billy Hope is kind of just Aggression-Times-Ten... until he isn't, but by then he still doesn't have much in the way of his main purpose: get my daughter back, get back my dignity as a fighter, period, end of case.<br/><br/>For some, this may be enough. I heard some cheering in the final fight (hey, that's not a spoiler either, you KNOW it's coming, what boxing movie wouldn't have it, let alone one as bare-bonedly-conventional as this one). And the acting may help show up some stuff. It's also notable as one of James Horner's final scores - albeit, and damn me for criticizing the recently departed, some of that is forced as the script is too, though not always. But ultimately, Southpaw feels weighed down by what it's required to go through in the steps of Making The Audience Feel Something, and is a case in point that a director and cast can only do so much with a lacking script. If this had a lessor cast, it might be unwatchable."

","Southpaw is a film starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Forest Whitaker, Rachel McAdams, and 50 Cent. It is directed by Antoine Fuqua and is written by Kurt Sutter. This movie focuses on Billy ""The Great"" Hope(Jake Gyllenhaal) rise, fall, and eventual return to stardom as he treks through losing everything from his wife,Mo(Rachel McAdams), to custody of his daughter(Oona Laurence), to his title loss. He then meets Tick(Forest Whitaker) a train and ex boxer, who works hard to teach Billy a new style of fighting.<br/><br/>This movie is great! This movie had lots of positives. For one, I thought it carried more emotional heft than most boxing movies. For the first act and half of the second act the movie focused on the depression Billy goes through and his eventual light at the end of the tunnel, Tick. I found this well executed for the most part. Another Great aspect of the movie are the performances. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a hauntingly quiet, arrogant, wounded, and above all angry performance. Though his performance was grand I do feel like he was a little miscast. Though I understand Eminem might not be the greatest actor, he stole 8 mile hand down and I believe he could've added just a tad bit more to the role. Oona Laurence offers one of the best child performances I've seen this year, with her role as Laila Hope. Though Gyllenhaal and Laurence give nuanced performances, the best performance by far was Forest Whitaker and definitely should be nominated for an Oscar. He was aggressive without being obnoxious. He was sympathetic with out being a tear jerker. Finally Eminem's son was Phenomenal! (See what I did there) Oh i almost forgot the direction was visceral and taut to say the least. He makes the action look brilliant and beautiful<br/><br/>I basically have only two problems with this movie. Firstly the writer seems to be playing darts with everything. He uses a ton of clichés and fails to add nuances to them to make them original. Basically he squanders the sheer potential of the script by his unoriginality towards certain things and his abundance of one dimensional character. Speaking on one dimensional characters Rachel McAdams and 50 cent give some of the most uninspired performances i have ever seen and I know for a fact they can both act. What a shame! <br/><br/>As a whole Southpaw is one of my favorite movies of the year and is a must see for people who enjoy boxing movies with a lot of heart thrills and action. Southpaw gets a B+ or a 7/10"

","I walked in to view this film not knowing what to expect. I knew that it was going to be brutal, visceral, and overwhelmingly violent...and I was okay with that. After all the script was pinned by Kurt Sutter who has pretty much cornered the market on brutal, visceral, overwhelmingly violent screenplays. The movie is directed by one of my favorites, Antoine Fuqua who knows how to shoot violence. I didn't expect to have such a mixed reaction to the whole thing.<br/><br/>First off, there will definitely be spoilers ahead. So, fair warning, SPOILERS!! <br/><br/>Okay, now that we've gotten that out of the way...I'm not sure how anyone can claim they don't know what's going to happen in the movie. Did you watch the trailer? The whole movie is in the trailer. Well, let me qualify that a bit. The whole 'arc' of the movie is in the trailer. I was a bit put off by this especially since I love the director and the screenwriter. This is the Rocky film Sylvester Stallone wish he had made. Except instead of a dim-witted boxer we have a dim-witted boxer totally fueled by rage. He has to get the hell knocked out of him in order to dig deep into his rage and pound the crap out of his opponent.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal plays Billy Hope. Yeah, yeah, we get it. Billy is the ""Great White Hope"". Jake has pretty much cornered the market on the tortured, quirky, psychotic anti-hero. Forrest Whittaker is his mentor who teaches him how to get in touch with the talent beneath the rage. Billy loses everything, hits rock bottom, then comes back. Cue tears and cheers.<br/><br/>Now let me tell you what I love about this movie. The film is, at its heart, the story of a father's love for his daughter and what he is willing to do to get her back into his life. Billy Hope is not the brightest bulb in the box, he works in a violent profession, and his rage fuels his ability to do that. But, Billy loves his wife and daughter. He is loyal to his friends. He just puts his trust in the wrong man, his Don King style manager played by Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson.<br/><br/>The relationship between Billy and Leila, his daughter, is one of the things that I really like about this film. Another is his relationship with his trainer, Tick Wills. Billy could have drowned himself in drugs, he could have self-destructed. He almost does. But he digs deep, gets help and comes back.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully filmed. You are not ringside. You are right in the ring feeling every punch and every blow. The soundtrack has music by Eminem, who was originally intended as the star if the movie had been a sequel to his film 8 Mile. The music is a perfect counterpoint to the action.<br/><br/>I don't know if I can recommend this film. I'd like to but it left me feeling a bit blah. Who knows..it will probably become a cult film."

","After not being a Jake Gygenhall fan at all, seeing Nightcrawler changed my opinion of him and I realise he is a fine actor. However this role just seemed to be a vehicle for us to be shown what the results of 2000 sit ups a day can achieve. In my opinion a dated and oft used formulae, pretty boring and WAY too predictable, in fact I was almost shocked at the end it was so corny. Very disappointed at your rating of 8 1, and that was my main reason for seeing it as there seems to be so little of value at the moment - summer hol viewing I suppose. Definitely not a contender, and should have been knocked out in around round 3 metaphorically speaking. Rather stick to Swedish noir on TV for the time being than waste a trip to the cinema on this. Very disappointing"
"suzzma","1","2","4","5 November 2015"," Don't know what all the fuss is about
","I was excited to watch this movie, I like Jake Gyllenhaal, Rachel McAdams and boxing movies but this was just a big let down. The storyline on paper sounded good, but it was just so slow to get there. I didn't even get to the part when she died. I saw when she got shot and then turned it off because I was dying with boredom. I enjoyed Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella Man, The Fighter and the Rocky's but this movie was so unoriginal. It wasn't Jake Gyllenhaal's best work either, it was like they were trying to drag out the storyline and the dramatic parts of the movie for effect but it wasn't executed well. I don't know why this has gotten such great ratings, this is my first review on IMDb and I only got on it so I could write another opinion about this film."
"hatman28","3","2","4","3 November 2015"," Couldn't finish
","Sadly, I couldn't even finish this movie. This title personifies how clichéd Hollywood had become. This is NOT a sports movie in any sense of the word. One reviewer stated that the boxing scenes were ""very well shot"", I would challenge that writer to show me any knowledge of sports that they possess. The boxing scenes were less realistic than 'Rocky' which is saying a lot and the drama was so over-done, you're left feeling lost with the way they are written.<br/><br/>Jake does a nice job acting the scenes, the poor rating is not on him, but the film is just plain bad. If you're looking for a sports film, move on. If you're looking for a hyper-drama, this may work for you."
"luke-a-mcgowan","5","2","4","29 August 2015"," As heavy-handed as the titular punch
","If Southpaw was more heavy handed, Jake Gyllenhaal would be in the cinemas delivering the title punch to the face of every member of the audience. An amalgamation of pretty much every boxing cliché ever, its not as emotionally powerful as Million Dollar Baby, not as well acted as Raging Bull, and doesn't hit the family angel as well as The Fighter. Even Grudge Match was as little bit of fun.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is beefed up and intense as Billy Hope. There's a lot of Sylvester Stallone punch-drunk mumbling and a lot of Robert DeNiro deranged intensity, but Hope is such a generic character that not even the brilliant Gyllenhaal could make him an iconic or even a memorable character. He's such a brutal, aggressive guy that you have to wonder what his wife and daughter see in him. Rachel McAdams is an endearing character, but I didn't buy for a second that she was from the same rough upbringing as him. <br/><br/>After tragedy strikes (as ruined in the trailer - really wonder the logic there, ruining the one twist in probably the most done-to-death storyline in film history), Billy links up with Tick (Forest Whitaker, playing a shameless hybrid of Morgan Freeman's and Clint Eastwood's characters from Million Dollar Baby). Despite being a four-time champion, Billy has to learn the basics of boxing again (because then how would we be able to pad the movie with boxing montages?) Billy is also trying desperately to reconnect with his daughter, who loves or hates him as required by the script. The drama is so heavy, particularly in Tick-Billy conversations or Billy's family problem scenes, that I found myself trying not to giggle.<br/><br/>There's still a sense of triumph in watching Billy succeed and get his daughter back, and I enjoyed elements of the film's boxing story and how it reflected on Hope's personality. But its still generic, heavy-handed and at times a bit boring, and that's not what I want in a movie."
"AliceofX","5","2","4","25 August 2015"," Good Characters, Weak Story
","Southpaw is a film that had a potential to be really good but it failed to achieve that goal. The cast is great and give us good and believable characters and if the film had a better plot they could have really shined. Jake Gyllenhaal gives another great performance and I wish his character could have had a better story.<br/><br/>Instead the story is clichéd and very derivative. Some films can make it work despite all that but Southpaw brought nothing to make it truly well liked and is therefore placed amid mediocrity.<br/><br/>Without going into plot spoilers I will only say my biggest problem was with the contrived drama. It seemed fake and over Hollywood-ized. It went against the sense of realism that the movie was trying to build. Basically full of those moments where the music gets sad and you're supposed to get sad because they tell you to but you don't because the story has not been built good enough.<br/><br/>Which is not to say I didn't enjoy it all. Some parts were interesting but they don't really come together to a pleasing whole. Southpaw might be a good watch at home, on the TV, but for the big screen there is nothing grand about it."
"dimbost","5","2","4","25 August 2015"," This tries to be Rocky for the new generations
","I want to start off, by saying that i am a HUGE fan of Boxing. and if this wasn't about boxing, i'd probably give this film a 4 or 5.<br/><br/>Southpaw had more then few problems with its story and its continuity. The cinematography and choreography were good, but far from being the best. Many boxing films have much more entertaining fights then Southpaw. <br/><br/>Story: Billy Hope is presented as an almost like Rocky character. Never explained why he is always dopey, slow and has a speech impairment. One could argue that it is because it is stated that he has no defense and lets his opponents just hit him so that he can fire up. Sounds like Rocky, except that Rocky tries show defense, but is more of a street brawler. both use same tactics. Hard punches, counter punches. <br/><br/>1. Miguel at the beginning and midpoint of the film, is not your typical bad guy, he shows a lot of respect for Billy, from clapping when he wins, to telling his idiot friend to shut up during the charity, his antics and media cries are all done to try and secure the fight against him, but there are clear signs of respect to him. But then the character just flips a 180. <br/><br/>2. At the charity, there were many reporters with their cameras who were not only following Billy as he was leaving, but also others who were doing an interview with Miguel. The probability that not a single one of those camera captured the shooting is ridiculous. Even if they were focused on the two men fight, they were being pushed back making all of their shots a wide angle shots, meaning capturing more of the space.<br/><br/>3.Billy never questions as to where his millions of dollars disappeared to, in less then one month after his wife's death. <br/><br/>4. every one turning their back on him. Not Curtis Jackson, but his so called close friends that he grew up with, all but one. Plus, the fact that he is so famous and can't get a single ad/ interview/ or commentator line of work is ridiculous, at least in Rocky it was because he couldn't read, but he tried. Here it's because he is just useless. <br/><br/>5. the daughter's strength and her version of depression. Now granted i am not an a child psychologist, but a young girl whose is very (super) close to her parents wouldn't be so strong (non- crying) as she was, yes she had one tear, and wasn't sleeping. But she was laughing and was always calm in all of her scenes. Even as to be calm enough to go and play outside with other kids, and do homework. <br/><br/>6. The ever lasting black eye. Black eye lasts up 14 days, assuming its a boxing injury lasts up to 30 days. After his loss to Turay where his has it again and his daughter is taken away from him. he is then told to have 30 days to get his act together, however during the second court scene he still has a black eye, and in his 3rd court scene it is still there, it is still there again 11 weeks later when he fights Miguel. That's some magic right there. near 14 weeks of having a black eye. <br/><br/>7. he has 3 title shots, there are 4 title shots, all within the period of one year. to be exact, all within the period of around 30 weeks. Thats impossible!!! and just stupid. How?... his first fight was day 1. He wins, remains the champion (Title fight 1) 2 weeks later is the charity, Wife dies, 2 weeks maybe less (presumed, as he still has all fresh wounds) later he signs the papers with Curtis to fight against Turay in 8 weeks. this puts the fight against Turay at around 11-14 weeks after day 1, he loses to Turay (Title fight #2). Hits the tree. Given 30 days (Court) with out his daughter. he is then given another 30 days. At which point Turay fights and loses to Miguel (Title fight #3) this puts this fight at around 16-17 weeks after day 1. 30 more days past for the Court, even though he agrees to the fight before the third court hearing. he is given 6 weeks to train. So if we take another 30 days which 5 weeks plus 6 weeks of training and add them to the 16-17 weeks past day 1. Billy fights Miguel 27-28 weeks after day 1. I'm not even going into the whole debate about the 1 year suspension. 4 title fights under 30 weeks is impossible.<br/><br/>Like I said this film tries to be Rocky of the new generation, but fails, Rocky was more consistent, we were told that Rocky wasn't all there. His brain was slow, we were told that he was a brawler growing up, that's why he fights a certain way. Billy is slow because either he is on drugs, or he has been hit so many times, we are not sure, or is it because he doesn't know what to say as he is depressed. He has had 43 fights, no losses but never learned how to defend himself. He grew up with friends that were his whole family, but then they all disappeared, even though they themselves have no families, so they should be super close. He has 3 pro fights, 1 charity even within 30 week period, there are 4 title shots within 30 week period. His promoter is a very cliché bad guy. His daughter's depression is almost non- existent. Making the other boxer use low punches and making him cliché is just stupid, why? Miguel's whole motivation was to get in the ring with him, and he did it."

","""A fighter only knows one way to work."" Billy Hope (Gyllenhaal) is the biggest and best boxer in the world. He controls his world in the ring and his wife (McAdams) controls his world outside the ring. After his temper gets the better of him and his wife is killed Billy's life begins to spin out of control. Faced with losing it all he turns to trainer Tick Wills (Whitaker) in hopes of getting his life, and daughter, back. It is very difficult to make a boxing movie and succeed. No matter how good it may be it will inevitably be compared to Rocky and Raging Bull. I have seen a ton of boxing movies and they have all fallen short, not because they were necessarily bad, but because they weren't classics like those were. They both had excitement in the ring and a riveting story out of the ring. This movie had both of those qualities and belongs in the same breath and level as those two. Gyllenhaal gives an Oscar worthy performance and the story is what keeps you interested rather than when is the next fight going to happen. I could go on and on about this but I will just say watch this. This is one of the best movies of the year and one of, if not the best sports movie in recent memory. I can't recommend this enough. Overall, Southpaw can hold it's own against Rocky and Raging Bullthere is no better compliment for a boxing movie. I give this a A+."

","Gyllenhaal--the product of an orphanage in Hell's Kitchen, New York--is a brash, undefeated light heavyweight boxing champion with a reckless fighting style that makes him a tough opponent, but also susceptible to taking excessive punishment. His life is still idyllic thanks to the support of his wife and daughter despite their well-founded reservations about his safety. When a personal tragedy occurs, he begins to unravel and his once prosperous career comes to an ignominious end. Some intentionally painful and ugly moments both in and out of the ring give you a sense of the dark path the lead character must walk down and endure, but it follows a much too familiar trajectory and builds up to a finale that you can see coming long before it ever gets there. Even with the work of quality actors who elevate the material, it still feels pretty routine. **½"

"JamesCinemaFan","7","0","0","16 March 2019"," A man of good faith.
","Every person is capable of good intentions. And within intentions lies the phenomenon one might term "" good faith"". That is, can a person make the utmost of the moral understanding at their disposal to translate their good intentions to the material and practical world in a profound and honorable way? If you can, you have ""good faith"", regardless of how far that falls short of objective justice. One example of good faith would be a slave master, in a world where all they know is slave-keeping, from their parents, religious leaders, and culture, but yet they find their way to treating their slaves with great compassion and respect, and eventually even to setting them free. Is this enough to satisfy objective justice? No. Should we demand from them that they do far more? Yes. For example, the slave master should obviously fight against slavery in general, not just let his own slaves go free. But what we can do with such a person is respect their good faith. That is to say, we can appreciate their good intentions that they have translated to the world around them, and we can sympathize and identify with that part of them. Because after all, none of us are immune to grave moral error. We must salute the flag of good faith in all people, regardless of their moral condition in other respects. Southpaw is a movie about just such a person. He comes from a world of extreme violence and survival. But in the end no one can deny how hard this man tries, to do justice to his wife and daughter and himself. And that quality we should salute in him, a quality that raises him in stature above other human beings who have the benefit of far better moral understanding, but who have made less of what they were given. This movie benefits from an extraordinary performance by Forest Whittaker, and some excellent moments from Jake Gyllenhaal and Oona Laurence."

","'Southpaw', although it doesn't bring anything new on the table in the boxing movie genre, is still one of the best boxing film outside the 'Rocky' saga and beside 'Raging Bull'. Jake Gyllenhaal is pure force majeure in this one and he is supported by Forest Whitaker's dedicated performance. Oona Laurence was wonderful as Billy Hope's daughter Leila. Although Rachel McAdams's screen time was quite brief (considering 2 hour running time) she still managed to leave impact. And all these dedicated performances turned 'Southpaw' very vivid emotional roller coaster ride. But don't think that without these great acting jobs this movie would have been just another cliche ridden bore. Although Jake Gyllenhaal's Billy Hope was most memorable part, Kurt Sutter's screenplay packs enough punch, and the author really knew (perhaps not on Stallone level with his Rocky movies) how to use these cliches the way they work.<br/><br/>Pretty straightforward and simple story, but Antoine Fuqua's directing style and superb acting make 'Southpaw' must see for every boxing movie fan, and like 'Rocky' movies, this one also holds re-watching value, even though the training montages aren't nearly as cool."

","I pretty much decided to watch this because I figured it would be a formulaic yet entertaining little respite which wouldn't require much in the way of deep thinking on my part... something I could just sort of zone out and put the old noggin on auto- pilot and maybe shop for stuff on amazon or update my Instagram or check my email on the side too, you know? Basically I'm just saying that I wasn't at all expecting something groundbreaking and transformative here, okay? And Jake Gyllenhall is a solid actor no doubt. The actress who plays his wife is good, too. Rachel McAdams right? I get her confused with Elizabeth Banks all the time. They're both good... whatever, that's not the point here obviously. <br/><br/>Anyway, the movie starts out more or less how I would think. We have a boxer dude, Billy Hope, who is a hard-nosed, street wise family man with all the heart you would expect, but of course with the cliché below-average intelligence to go with it. He's a veteran, undefeated 43-0 light heavyweight champ who has a gorgeous wife who loves him deeply and genuinely, and a daughter around 10 or 11 who waits patiently in her bed at home for her mommy and daddy to come back after the fight which he wins, and is still able to tuck her in and give her a goodnight kiss as she counts the bruises on his face so lovingly. He then caps the night off with some well- deserved nookie from his beautiful lady... a seemingly perfect life. Obviously we know things are gonna go downhill. <br/><br/>But how his perfect life just falls apart after our expositional introduction is so dismissive of any realistic premise whatsoever, it is miles and miles beyond the standard suspension of disbelief that should be expected from any type of moderately intelligent audience whatsoever. <br/><br/>The writing of this movie at this point, and for the rest of it is essentially just throwing any and all credibility it may have established out the window just so that it can hit you over the head with the notion of redemption at the end. Billy loses his gorgeous best friend wife to a stray bullet after an altercation at charity event with a fighter-in-waiting who's been whining on the sideline for his shot at the champ. One of this antagonist's crew pulls out a gun in the middle of a fight between the two boxers in a room full of witnesses as if this was a teen gang violence movie or something. Basically it's a ludicrous way for Gyllenhall to lose his wife and begin his necessary breakdown in order to come back at the end. But this murder pretty much gets brushed aside, and NOBODY seems to do a damn thing in finding out who actually pulled the gun...including Gyllenhall. Then everyone seems to expect the dude to keep on business as usual with apparently no time allotted to grieve or be given a break. Oh and also even though he's the champ and undefeated, he's also of course somehow on the verge of bankruptcy right after losing his wife as well. And his manager.. played so laughably bad by 50 Cent.. is seen right after he loses his wife sitting ringside at the next fight with the same fighter who's crew murdered his wife. I mean... really? I'm not even going to bother going through the rest of all the ridiculous plot points.. how he loses custody of his daughter becomes the crux of what he needs to fight for... and that's when the story actually starts to become engaging and emotive. But the way we arrive there is so sensationalist, almost Kafka-esque in an unintended fashion due to the authority the state plays in removing his custody. If his fall had been more his own fault, perhaps he would have lost some standing in the viewer rooting for him but it would have been something that real people could identify with even more. It would have benefited with more real mistakes made on his end and simply not just being reckless in his grieving with seemingly no help from any friends even though he clearly has a crew of good guys he was surrounding himself with in the beginning. It just makes the journey he goes through ring hallow, and all it would have taken was more earnest care in actually developing a believable arch instead of just rushing to the redemption. <br/><br/>In fact, if the writer was so eager to get to the comeback, the rising from ashes of tragedy.. if he really just wanted to rush the audience to seeing Billy Hope restore his own hope and all that stuff etc etc... I think we shouldn't have ever actually seen any of his perfect life exposition at all. It should have just been gradually discovered through reference in the dialogue. That would have been more effective and sold the premise a lot better in the end. Gyllenhall makes the movie work enough because he's a great actor, but there were a lot of missed opportunities in the script because the writer was too eager to make the story about the breakdown and building back of a champ who loses his compass in the form of wife. <br/><br/>This movie would have been a lot more interesting if the first scene was Gyllenhall showing up at Wills gym, the first scene that Forest Whitaker is introduced in. If that's the opening scene, then we as the audience wouldn't know who Billy Hope is yet, we would just know he's a big deal to the other kids training at the gym in how they talk about him. That would have delivered a lot more intrigue to the story. The whole exposition sells this movie short and makes it almost laughable at points. Opportunities missed."

","I like boxing movies. I'm almost a sucker for them. Cinderella Man, Rocky 3, Creed, and on and on. I do like the hardworking underdog/redemption story theme, and a well-choreographed match.<br/><br/>And these fight sequences are okay, plus Gyllenhaal clearly got in shape for them.<br/><br/>BUT he SO overacts, and the character is SO obnoxious, that it just isn't that fun to watch.<br/><br/>Whether scripted or not, you feel like Gyllenhaal is ad-libbing a constant patter of nonsense babble in many scenes. We're supposed to care a lot that he loses his great wife, and his daughter is taken away from him. But BOTH happen because HE DOES NOT LISTEN, and he never really confronts that killing flaw.<br/><br/>Even in the courtroom scene, when the judge is informing him what's going to happen, Gyllenhaal (I can't feel it's the character) is mugging and clowning and yapping at his daughter across the room, clearly not taking the trial or the judge seriously -- and so, predictably, when the sentence is finished, he says ""What?"" Yeah, Enstein: what she said while you were acting like a dimwitted toddler.<br/><br/>What arc there is feels jerky and lacks credibility. He's an idiot, he's an idiot, he's an idiot...oh, okay, now he's really going to train for this fight. Well, great, so I guess everything's all fixed now. And if he can beat that other fighter, he'll be a fit father. Great.<br/><br/>It left me more irritated than entertained, and not in any good way.<br/><br/>I gave it a 5 because the fight sequences are decent, and the little girl who plays the daughter (Oona Laurence) is one of the more consistent, empathy-provoking characters."

I mean how is it possible with every movie? <br/><br/>I already lost hope when this movie started to repeat Rocky: A fight ends with a win. A contender opens his mouth immediately. It just seemed so stupid to come out of a winning fight only to have people pushing you to take the next one immediately. It's so stupid.<br/><br/>When 50 cent came up on the screen and opened his mouth I lost all hope. That man is a bad actor. Period.

","All Billy Hope knew was how to fight inside of the ring but he was never prepared to take life's greatest punches in Kurt Sutter's Southpaw. As a young boy, Billy Hope is in the child protective service and gets into many fights. He doesn't have anyone to teach him how to take life's greatest punches. Until he meets his wife Maureen in the child protective service. She opens up a new door in his life and helps keep him in check.<br/><br/>Southpaw begins with Billy Hope fighting recklessly in a match. He comes out bloody and beaten up. Maureen tells him to stop fighting recklessly otherwise he won't be around for her and their daughter. Billy's life takes a drastic turn when he lets his quick temper get in the way and he gets into a fight during a press conference with a newcomer who wants to challenge him. The fight ends in gunfire and Maureen is shot in the stomach. She dies before the ambulance is able to reach her, leaving Billy devastated. The one thing that was stable in his life is now gone, all because he lost his temper during a press conference. His actions become suicidal and his daughter Leila is taken away from him by child protection services. When the last remaining person that he loves is taken way from him, for the first time, Billy becomes determined to change himself for someone in order to get them back. After seeking a new trainer to help him train for an upcoming fight, Billy's entire character changes from cocky and not wanting to follow directions to wanting to follow the rules to get his daughter as soon as possible. He looks to the new trainer with admiration and realizes that Maureen would've liked the new trainer because they both care for his well being.<br/><br/>Billy slowly becomes more responsible by maintaining his job and focusing on getting his daughter back. When Billy is called back to the court to determine if he can have his daughter back, the judge demos him not stable enough to get her back. After finding out that she has to stay another month in child services, Billy's daughter wishes that he were the one dead, not her mom. Billy is more determined than ever to win the boxing championship. This time it is not for the money, but for his daughter. His determination to get his daughter back is relatable because that is what I would do in Billy's situation. <br/><br/>Come the day of the match, Billy fights responsibly and not with his anger. To end the fight, his trainer tells him to use a Southpaw. When his opponent is knocked out, Billy finally gets his daughter back. Proving to himself that he does have the skill to take life's greatest punches. This movie is a great example of perseverance and grit. I love how realistic the training and fighting scenes are. The characters are very relatable and the viewer is able to connect with the characters and experience the emotions that they are feeling. It's a good reminder that everyone, no mater the age and skill always has to work their way to the top in order to achieve what they want."

Even though Rachal McAdams has less screen space, she did a fabulous job in her role. Jake Gyllenhaal has truly taken his role serious and lived like a boxer in his own style.

"EthanBJones_03","8","0","0","16 November 2016"," Very good movie; recommend it; one of the better boxing movies in recent memory
","Overall: A great movie and one of the better boxing movies in recent memory<br/><br/>Good: Acting was great with Jake Gyllenhaal, Forrest Whitaker and even 50 cents providing top performances. Not career defining exactly but very good, powerful roles. Oona Laurence, his daughter, also gives a great performance making you believe her situation. The cinematography is pretty well done as are the boxing scenes which were well choreographed. The movies follows the typical boxing movie route nailing clichés such as training montage, hero-zero and large fight at the end but does each cliché greatly and somehow makes them feel fresh. You also really feel for the main character, Billy 'The Great' Hope! His story, while immensely clichéd, is told well and makes you feel so sorry for him.<br/><br/>Bad: I didn't like the music that much, especially for the training montage. Sadly, one of the movies greatest strengths is also its most devastating flaw. That being the clichéd story. It feels fresh and well d1one but it is, at the end of the day, the same story we've seen a lot and you can connect the dots with ease. Everything was predictable except one thing I expected to happen at the end. However, not doing this feels like a missed opportunity. It might come of as cheesy and stupid but I feel it would give an emotional lift to the final fight. <br/><br/>Best Part: The climactic fight between Billy Hope and Miguel Escobar.<br/><br/>MVP: Jake Gylenhaal as Billy 'The Great' Hope<br/><br/>8/10"

","Have we seen this story a million times before? Yes, sure, we have. Southpaw however says; ""So What""!!!<br/><br/>This movie had emotional engagement, which is why when Billy lost the woman wearing his ring, we as the viewers felt the loss too. Rachel McAdams is so stunning in front of the camera, that we really did just need the first quarter, to fall in love with her character.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal was superb. Billy was a wreck and Jake sold it. You really do feel the inevitability of everything falling apart around him, and once it does, though very predictable, you're still so heavily invested in Billy and Leila that you're still asking yourself; ""Billy, why didn't you listen to her in the first place"".<br/><br/>The pace and structure of the film however, like the Japanese Gyro- Top, though still rapidly spinning, would tend to seem like it's about to topple over. However, Antoine maintained an emotional connection with the viewer, to a point where, even you as the viewer, would choose to hold on to the feeling, thus the top, kept spinning, with Antoine and Jake continuing the necessary momentum.<br/><br/>The Jab-Cross-Left Uppercut-Cross combination of Antoine Fuqua, Jake Gyllenhaal, Rachel McAdams and James Horner, like Billy's final move on Escobar, is a knock-out, and though you may recover from it... The points still tip against you.<br/><br/>So yeah, 8/10 for this one. Very enjoyable and oh so, poignant.<br/><br/>In Memory of James Horner."

","I am not a fan of sports movies, but this film has a few things going really well for it.<br/><br/>The biggest is the actor performances, with Jake Gyllenhaal playing one of the roles of his life and Forest Whitaker coming a close second. But I am not discounting the secondary roles, either: even the child actor was really good, even the ""villain""!<br/><br/>Then there is the story. Instead of starting from the bottom and overcoming adversities to become great, our hero starts off as the champ, then loses everything that ever meant anything to him and he has to find his way back from despair.<br/><br/>And final and third point is that the story is adapted from the life of Eminem translated into boxing. So it's basically a sequel to 8 Miles :)<br/><br/>Bottom line: I watched the film with interest even if it's not the type of things I usually go for, mesmerized by Gyllenhaal's performance."
"lesleyharris30","6","0","0","18 September 2016"," Though the Performances are Captivating, it Stumbles with Overwhelming Clichés,
","Southpaw is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot, albeit a top notch cast. The performances are Oscar worthy, Jake Gyllenhaal is completely engrossed in to this character from start to finish, he clearly underwent extensive training and deserves all the praise for his dedication. There is also a very touching relationship between Gyllenhaal and his daughter, a heartwarming a feature, and his scenes with Forest Whitaker are without a doubt the films highlight. <br/><br/>However, the reason no award praise was given is a result of how lackluster the story is. It's all very standard, there's no big moments that take your breath away or captivate because you have seen everything that is done here in other movies more effectively. It also tries too hard to be emotional, there is constant sad music playing throughout, it all feels very forced and thrown at the audience, there's no subtlety. <br/><br/>The performances are really too good for this film, although they do showcase how good acting can make a predictable, clichéd film more interesting. Albeit very flawed, I think Southpaw is worth the watch for the acting alone, particularly if you are a fan of Gyllenhaal, just do not go out of your way to see it. <br/><br/>After losing his wife and daughter, a boxer hires a trainer to get his life back on track. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Jake Gyllenhaal / Worst Performamce: 50 Cent"

","Depending on how successful the movie is on selling you the relationships in the movie (it did work for me and judging by the overall rating, most of whom have seen it), this will have an impact on you, even though it does have clichés lined up all the way until the end. Still there are things that do hurt, especially if you invested and because the actors are doing a really great job of selling it.<br/><br/>It does obviously and as stated not redefine the Box genre (if you call it genre, maybe niche or something like that would be more suitable), but it does what a movie of its size and merit is supposed to do. It takes you on a journey and it stays suspenseful all the way through"

","Jake Gyllenhal delivers another terrific performance, this time as boxing champ Billy Hope. JakeG rips your guts out with his emotional performance as this somewhat crazed boxer who seems to thrive on taking punishment before he delivers a knockout blow.<br/><br/>Billy has seen it all, having grown up on the streets, in child care. He's been there. Rachel McAdams plays Mo, his wife Maureen he met on the streets who understands him like no other. Finally their daughter Leila played by Oona Laurence gives a pretty good account for herself against this formidable acting group.<br/><br/>When tragedy befalls Billy, something he feels guilty for, everything falls apart. He has to dig deep, deeper than he ever has had to, to resurrect himself. Everything that matters to him is on the line. Forest Whitaker as Tick Wills takes him in and agrees to train him.<br/><br/>As plots go, you've seen this movie before with a boxer who's on top one day, then down and out the next. However, what's different here is the power from Gyllenhal, and the film skill of director Antoine Fuqua. The camera angles are terrific, with blurry POV images that put you right there in the fighter's head. The music is top notch too.<br/><br/>What would have made this a great film would have been a bit more background on Billy's past, and on Tick's, because without more info on that, you have to assume they lost something and will fight till the death to get it back. <br/><br/>Terrific acting, excellent direction, and a decent story line. See Southpaw for all this and more. Enjoy."
"hjgerbs","10","0","0","1 September 2016"," Southpaw Inspires Hope
","Southpaw was a superb boxing drama. There was fame, tragedy, hard times, hope, and triumph all in one movie. Watching this movie made you experience a wide range of emotions; you found yourself shedding a tear to cheering for Mr.Hope as he throws a jab and a hook after one another. Although the storyline was pretty familiar I thought it was a thrilling movie. One of the components I feel is important in a great movie is if it engages the viewer from the very start to the end, which I was. I had to stay up past midnight just to finish the movie since I didn't want to turn it off. I was so engaged to the point that I felt I was right next to the main character, Mr.Hope. The movie sent me through a whirlwind of emotions that I don't usually experience in most movies. To be completely honest I even may have shed a couple of tears out of sympathy for Mr.Hope and his daughter. Recently I watched a very similar boxing drama movie, Creed, and Southpaw by far was the best movie. The only complaint I have with the movie was the excessive use of language. I realize in most current movies there will be some language but this was too much. I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends."

The performances by the main characters is exceptional. The story as well is very good. Where it is let down is, on stylistic choices which is hugely disappointing. <br/><br/>The film is a boxing film that goes from one guy, losing everything to regain it for his daughter. It's like a sub-conscious drive in Fuqua to raise this film after he directed Olympia Has Fallen <br/><br/>If he simply focused on strong editing, better pace during the dramas and maybe, just put McAdams in hospital because the lack of an ambulance and recovery in a modern day city as she is surrounded by people is the plothole of this movie.<br/><br/>Southpaw, also predictable, but I loved the cheesy dialogues when Billy's (Gyllenhaal) daughter says to him ""You f*** up""! 😁"

","Gyllenhall is a reliable performer. We can count on him giving his best. This means both the emotional and physical make up of his characters. This is what makes a film like ""Nightcrawler"" rise beyond its simple premise. He shone in several films before, but his turn in ""Southpaw"" has set up new marks, even for him.<br/><br/>The film follows a powerful boxing world champion who continues undefeated. His main source of support is his tough and beautiful wife, played convincingly by McAdams. He survives and succeeds as long as she's around because she's his emotional source of support, as well as a great manager who knows and understands his mercurial nature.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a tragic turn of events leaves him widowed, and because of his temper he neglects himself and exposes his daughter to drugs and violence. This will place new demands on him. The question remains whether he will be able to conquer those challenges and regain control of his personal and professional career.<br/><br/>""Southpaw"" introduces us to a tortured man whose life has been shaped by the worst of circumstances, who rises to the top, loses his ways, and finds new opportunities to fly again. Forrest Whitaker comes him to provide him with training and insight. He's a steady source of support; however, he has his own problems, and these might affect his dedication because both men are driven and sometimes unable to look around for circumstances that might affect the achievement of their goals.<br/><br/>Let it be said that most people in the audience will be pleased by the way the film unfolds as we see some exciting boxing pieces, realistic rather than stylized. Every punch is felt, every potential knock out takes our breath, and watching the winner take the prize is indeed an exhilarating experience. Add to that, strong emotional lines, and another great performance by Jake, and we have a fantastic film."

Well, I can honestly say, hands down, his performance is one of the strongest I have seen in a film. This truly is a great actor at work. <br/><br/>Jake's performance I had expected from the reviews I had read but what I didn't expect was the power of the story in this film. Full of unexpected twists, heart wrenching moments and an ability to have you routing for the 'good guy' in this exceptional tale of defiance and courage. Watching this film I simply did not anticipate the emotional roller-coaster it put me through. <br/><br/>I always say the mark of a good film is one that can make you feel something not just in the moment but leave you thinking and contemplating for days even weeks after watching it. That is exactly what you get with Southpaw. <br/><br/>Such a good cinematic story, performance, direction and cinematography would be lost without the power of a good score to go with it. As is to be expected, James Horner delivers one of his best scores filled with a wealth of subtlety and beauty that doesn't overpower the film but simply enhances it to state of euphoria. I find it incredibly fitting that this film, one of his finest musical achievements, is ultimately left in loving memory of him. A true pinnacle of his fantastic career. <br/><br/>If you are unsure about this film, please watch it and be open to its story.

","Billy Hope (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is the undisputed light- heavyweight boxing champion of the world. He is unbeaten over a career of 43 fights. He is happily married to beautiful Maureen (Rachel McAdams) and has a young daughter, Leila (Oona Laurence). His life seems perfect, but then, during a fracas with a rival boxer, his wife is shot and killed. They had known each other since they were 12 years old, and now the bottom has fallen out of his world. The death of his wife sends Billy into a downward spiral, resulting in him being barred from professional boxing for a year, the loss of his house and almost all his possessions and, most painfully, the loss of his daughter to the custody of Social Services. In order to gain back his daughter and restart his life, he seeks out a particular trainer, Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker). Now he is starting his life again, at the bottom.<br/><br/>More than merely a boxing movie. Yes, it is about a boxer, has some great fight scenes and the climax is a fight, but it is more than that. It is about bouncing back and changing for the sake of the ones you love. Most tellingly it is about a father's love for his daughter and what he will do to get her back.<br/><br/>This all said, the fight scenes are very impressive, and I'm not really a boxing fan. Very gritty and not the usual all glory-no pain or work you usually see in boxing movies. <br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is very convincing as Billy Hope, and clearly transformed himself for the role, making his performance even more authentic. <br/><br/>On the downside, does feel a bit schmaltzy at times, and one or two turns of events do feel a bit contrived, but these are minor issues.

","I am about to give you a round & round pun review of Director Antoine Fuqua's boxing movie ""Southpaw"". So if you are a lightweight when it comes to pun corniness, I suggest you to throw in the towel and stop reading now. Aaaanywways, ""Southpaw"" stars Jake Gyllenhaal as light heavyweight boxing champion Billy Hope. At the film's onset, he is pretty much past being the great white hope; he is the champion of the world, he has a gorgeous wife, has a kind & loving daughter, and is filthy rich. But Fuqua then turns the movie into a ""riches to rags"" story when tragedy strikes; and I am not going to hit you now with a spoiler because it was in all the film's trailers, his wife is killed. Hope then loses all hope of both the boxing world and the living world and spirals into darkness. The rest of the film focuses on Hope trying to get hope again to return to glory. The movie did have its inspiring moments but I was not left hooked or even right hooked with the movie's mundane & rather predictable narrative & screenplay. Now I am not going to say that Fuqua ""fuquaed up"" because he did an admirable job in directing the boxing scenes, but his Screenwriter Kurt Fuller did not fill the movie with any enticing dialogue. Gyllenhaal does go ""punch to punch"" with a knockout performance as Hope. Rachel McAdams gets a minor spotlight as his wife Maureen, but does it admirably. However, I could not say the same for Forest Whitaker's stale performance as boxing gym owner and trainer Tick Willis; his performance did tick me off at times. Listen, I am not saying that ""Southpaw"" should be left out of your ""movies to see"" list, but temper your expectations below the ""Creed"". *** Average"

There is absolutely nothing new here, every cliché is adhered to, every chance to tug the heart strings is prominent, while the finale is as obvious as any one who watches sports movies will expect. But these things don't make it a bad film.<br/><br/>It's very well mounted by the makers, expertly performed by the principal actors, and, well, there's often a time when you need a rousing pick-me-up movie. The camera work and choreography is high grade, while director Antoine Fuqua is able to keep a realistic feel to the drama throughout.

","I do enjoy a good sport film, especially a boxing film so I was excited to see this film. The premise of the film sees a top boxer's life get turned upside down as he attempts to get his life and career back on track. Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the best actors going today and he continues that in this film with a great performance. You truly care about his character and the situation he has been put in, he also has transformed himself physically which adds to his character. Rachel mcadams plays his wife in the film and she does a good job adding humanity to his character unfortunately she just isn't in the film that much. Forest Whittaker plays his coach and he is great in this film adding a personal friendship into Gyllenhaals life. 50 cent is the boxing promoter in this film and he does a good job in the role. The girl who plays Gyllenhaals daughter in the film does a really good job being a believable kid actress that delivers a powerful emotional performance. The story has some really good dramatic qualities and a great ending. But at times it does feel like this film tries to beat you over the head with the drama which could have been done with being shortened a little bit. The script has some great dramatic dialogue that really made the drama hit home. However, for a sports film there is absolutely no humour in it which I understand because of the dark tone but I do feel like it could have done with a bit of humour. The style of the film is a mixed bag, all the boxing scenes are awesome with the hits feeling hard and heavy. However, the overall tone of the film is incredibly dark and it is a bit of a hard watch.

","If only Southpaw was half the film that Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was, then what a mighty drama it would've been.<br/><br/>Coming off the back of a career best stretch of work that goes right back to the excellent Prisoners and culminated at its peak with the fantastically eerie and memorable Nightcrawler, Gyllenhaal has been on some type of roll in recent years and where his role as night-time photographer Louis Bloom saw him look gaunt, thin and generally unwell, Southpaw sees the committed actor ripped and looking the part as hardened New York boxer Billy Hope whose lost his beloved wife Maureen (played by the sadly underutilised Rachel McAdams) and finds himself spiralling out of control after years of a being a successful boxer.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal completely inhabits his good intentioned but not always wise boxer and he delivers a knockout performance that is in fact too good for a film of Southpaw's predictable and sadly un-affecting narrative and while he makes the film far more watchable than it should be, he can't save the film from becoming a highly forgettable boxing tinged drama.<br/><br/>From the film's opening 15 minutes it's not hard to see exactly where proceedings are being led to and where they will end up (once Forest Whitaker's harsh yet kind hearted trainer Tick Wills shows up you may as well press the stop button) and whilst director Antoine Fuqua finds excitement and energy inside the boxing ring the films sporadically used bouts aren't enough to save the film's total lack of motivation outside the ring and frustratingly this marks another so-so picture from Fuqua who seems to have peaked far too early with his standout 2001 Denzel Washington star vehicle Training Day.<br/><br/>Another glaring issue with Southpaw is the way in which it drops the ball regarding Hope's relationship with his estranged young daughter Leila there are far too few scenes in Southpaw between the pair and with a central driving force in the story centring around Hope's wish to be the father his daughter needs, this is a big mistake by Fuqua and his famed Sons of Anarchy screenwriter Kurt Sutter.<br/><br/>For fans of Gyllenhaal Southpaw will offer up another great chance to see the esteemed performer deliver another memorable and full bodied turn but as a boxing drama, Southpaw is merely ticking off a checklist of events that have been done before and done a whole lot better.<br/><br/>2 ½ back tattoos out of 5"

He throws everything and the kitchen sink at this character. So does director Antoine Fuqua. There is no denying the power from the pairing of Fuqua and Gyllenhaal. The script overload may be exactly the wrong idea for the duo."
"nmholland","9","0","0","28 April 2016"," Another Great Boxing Film, With Jake Gyllenhaal In It This Time
","Southpaw is directed by Antoine Fuqua and stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Billy Hope, a world champion boxer who, when a certain event happens in his life, finds himself in a downward spiral towards poverty and depression. After reaching rock bottom, he meets a trainer of a boxing gym named Tick Wills, played by Forest Whitaker, and decides that the past can't, and won't get the best of him. He then works his way to the top, encountering all the people responsible for his downfall.<br/><br/>Okay, to get it out of the way, yes, Southpaw follows the ""boxing"" movie cliché. However, almost every fighting/boxing movie does. Rocky and all of its sequels, Cinderella Man (2005), Raging Bull (1980), and pretty much every other movie involving a fighter/boxer follows this formula. But, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. This is proved by Southpaw, another amazing boxing movie. Near everything about Southpaw was great, and it surprisingly had a lot of emotion to it.<br/><br/>The best thing about Southpaw is the actors and their portrayals of the characters. Jake Gyllenhaal is amazing as Billy, especially for being just a few months out of Nightcrawler (2014). Rachel McAdams as Billy's wife, Maureen, was a great casting choice. Although she played the cliché ""worried wife,"" she did it well, and it worked well for this movie. Forest Whitaker is, once again, great in his role. He plays the retired fighter very nicely, and brought a lot of life to this dark movie. Even 50 Cent (Curtis Jackson) does pretty good. 50 Cent plays Billy's agent, and plays strictly by business, and he does it well.<br/><br/>However, despite all of the great acting throughout Southpaw, the acting that surprised me the most was that of Billy's daughter, Leila, played by Oona Laurence. This girl was only around 12 when playing this part, and gives a performance that most 30-40 year olds can't even give. She was great in every scene she was in, especially in one scene, no spoilers, when she is expressing her anger towards her father for certain things going on in their life. Her performance blew me away, and I really hope to see her in future films.<br/><br/>The direction by Antoine Fuqua, particularly during the fight scenes, is amazing. There are specific shots during the boxing matches where the camera was in first person view, and it's very impressive. In the way that the shot was set up, the camera displays Billy's opponent punching at the screen, which is great. It immerses the viewer straight into the film, and adds a whole new level the movie's experience.<br/><br/>Now, the only complaint I had with Southpaw was a very small one. This movie's depressing, and that's not a bad thing. Most boxing movies center around the zero-to-hero plot, and Southpaw follows this old formula, and does it very well. Maybe too well. At a certain point, the audience starts to get the sadness of Billy's life beaten over their heads so hard that it gets a bit exasperating. Although it's a good premise, the film delves into the sadness too hard at some points, and it's distracting and exhausting after awhile.<br/><br/>Overall, Southpaw is a great movie, and is a nice addition to the boxing movie collection. I'd recommend Southpaw to anyone who can handle the violence and sadness aspects."

","You know what, Jake Gyllenhaal delivers and I honestly think without his performance the film would be nothing. Though it's not his greatest performance. Gyllenhaal's character Billy Hope does take central stage and over shadows most of other characters. I don't think there was a balanced investment into them when compared to Billy Hope. The death of Hoppy in particular, just got swept up under the canvas too quickly.<br/><br/>Having said that, young Oona Laurence does an amazing job playing the estranged daughter and the two have their own boxing match of emotions outside the ring. Whitaker is good too but wanted to see more of his character. 50 Cent is an all out G but it's all business; sharply dressed and calculating; I think this is his best role to date. <br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua does a great job, it's a fresh, superb story; but I'm undecided about the ending, I'm not sure it delivers the punchline the rest of the movie actually deserved. Moll's dying scene is epic, emotional and powerful and watching Billy getting beaten up on all angles while on his downfall to self destruction is provoking. There just isn't enough energy to when he actually gets back up on his feet. <br/><br/>Not sure James Horner was the right composer for the score but it's a shame to hear this was his last soundtrack before passing (RIP James Horner) and honourable to hear he did it for free! The rest of the soundtrack suits the film with artist such as Eminem, The Weeknd, Frank Ocean and of course a track from 50 Cent himself. The film opens out with one of my favourite tracks Rob Bailey & The Hustle Standard's 'Beast' <br/><br/>I can imagine trying to produce a boxing movie that's both original and unpredictable to be quite a feat and Antoine Fuqua does a good job of it but it is no way the best boxing film since Raging Bull like some critics have said. I would rank this next to Real Steel and lacked the knock-out I was hoping for, though still a very good film and worth a watch. <br/><br/>Running Time: 8 The Cast: 8 Performance: 9 Direction: 8 Story: 7 Script: 7 Creativity: 7 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 7 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for Jake's and Oona's performance. <br/><br/>74% 7/10"
"jimbo-53-186511","7","0","0","23 April 2016"," Despite feeling like a pastiche of the Rocky films Southpaw has enough heart and intensity for this not to matter too much
","Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) is very much at the top of his game with 43 wins and 0 losses. However, all these fights are taking their toll on Hope and his wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) is trying talk him into throwing the towel in so that he can spend more time with his family and watch his daughter grow up and graduate. After winning his latest match, Hope is taunted by an up and coming boxer named Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez). Hope's lack of self-control gets the better of him when Escobar taunts him once too often which culminates in the two men fighting. Sadly amidst all of the chaos that their fight causes Hope's wife ends up getting shot and tragically dies. Her death is the start of a downward spiral for Hope which, amongst other things, results in him losing his daughter to child protection services. In a bid to get himself back in the right place Hope enlists the help of renowned boxing trainer Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) who may be his only chance at getting his life back on track.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion Southpaw is a film that has a much stronger second half than first half. Although it feels like a pastiche of the Rocky films more or less for its entire running time the comparisons are more noticeable in the early stages; wife trying to talk hubby into quitting boxing, the cocky boxer trash-talking the champion and trying to convince him to get in the ring with him, a promoter who seems loyal but predictably is only interested in staying with a boxer that can make him money etc. Despite the familiarity Southpaw still remains an interesting picture and Gyllenhaal brings such passion and intensity to his role here that it often doesn't matter that we're watching a re-tread of pastures old for the most part.<br/><br/>The second half of the film (where Forest Whitaker's character Tick Wills is introduced) is definitely the better part of the film. Although they seem very different when they first meet I got the impression that they both had more in common than they'd care to admit; both men were at the top of their game when incidents happened during their boxing careers which effectively put them out of the game; Wills injuring his eye during a fight and Hope's downward spiral after his wife dying. The difference here is that Wills injury forced him to retire whereas Hope's career was merely in decline as opposed to being finished. Although their careers took very different turns I felt the common bond that the men shared was that they'd both been at the top and knew what it was like to have that taken away from them. Another key moment in the film was with Hoppy's death and Wills reaction to his death; this was a man who seemed to be calm and composed most of the time, but Hoppy's death threatened to push him over the edge (as it almost did with Hope when his wife died). Again I got the feeling that Wills felt guilty for Hoppy's death and felt that he could have done something to prevent it (brushing off Hope's concerns for the kid was a pivotal factor here). I think these two things together are what cemented the bond between the two men and this is something that is improved upon as things go on.<br/><br/>If we look at Forest Whitaker's character then again the comparisons to characters from Rocky are inevitable; essentially he's another Mighty Mickey or a Duke type character - although I'd probably say that he's closer to Mighty Mickey in terms of his personality and ethics. Although it may seem like a cliché, I still liked the way that Wills convinced Hope that boxing is more about the mind than it is about merely being able to throw punches. Hope was actually only successful as a boxer because he could take a punch as he demonstrates an inability to defend himself in the early stages. Not only does Wills massively improve Hope's defence but he also improves his temperament which is something that was getting the better of him far too often. Yes it's all stuff we've seen before but it's again it's all done with enough heart, intensity and emotion for it not to seem too important.<br/><br/>If we look at the performances then I have to say that this is probably one of Gyllenhaal's best performances; he brings one of the most intense performances in a boxing film since Robert De Niro's performance in Raging Bull. His energy and commitment (not to mention his impressive physical transformation) are all extremely impressive and he really is quite the screen presence here. Whitaker gives another superb performance, but then again doesn't he always?? <br/><br/>So yes Southpaw doesn't have many original elements and yes the script doesn't really offer any surprises. However, these negatives are compensated for by an excellent performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and an equally impressive turn from Forest Whitaker. It has heart, passion and intensity and also covers its 2 hour running time with little in the way of padding or filler. I liked it and I reckon that those who enjoy boxing films will enjoy it too."

","Released in 2015, ""Southpaw"" tells the story of a champion boxer (Jake Gyllenhaal) who suffers tragedy and loses everything but his talent, drive and daughter. With the help of a trainer (Forest Whitaker) he seeks to get his crown back, plus revenge. Rachel McAdams plays his wife, Oona Laurence his daughter, 50 Cent his manager and Miguel Gomez his nemesis.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't hide the fact that it's a modern amalgam of the Rocky movies, like II, III, V and VI. While the score is by James Horner the soundtrack is by Eminem with two impressive rap/metal songs: ""Kings Never Die"" and ""Phenomenal."" Some people think this limits the film's appeal, but it also could be argued that it fits its raw urban tone. On that note, there's fluent cussing so stay away if that turns you off.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, I've never seen Gyllenhaal in a movie before, although I recognize him, of course. He always struck me as one of those Hollywood pretty boys. I bring this up because nothing could be further from the truth with his role in ""Southpaw"" where he's the furthest thing from being a ""pretty boy."" Here, he's thoroughly convincing as a street tough who thinks with his fists and understands little about finance and the business side of boxing.<br/><br/>I was mainly interested in this movie due to McAdams, but her role is relatively small. Nevertheless, the movie pulled me into its story and entertained me for a couple of hours. Beyond that, it's a good lesson on humbling thyself and never giving up.<br/><br/>*** MINOR SPOILERS*** Some people complain at how quickly the champion boxer loses his great wealth but, for one, it was a matter of several months, not a couple weeks. Furthermore, His accountant mentions that his funds are being burned through; he obviously had a payroll. Then it is noted that the house is mortgaged, he has zero income because he stopped fighting and his tax return was due. He then takes the HBO deal and in the first fight foolishly assaults the referee, which incurs a huge lawsuit. I would assume his purse would be withheld as a result.<br/><br/>Also consider the fact that Mike Tyson made and lost $300 million. Yes, Mayweather and Pacquiao make gigantic money but look at other champions in other divisions. Unless you're a boxing fan you don't know the earnings of the best cruiserweight or the best bantamweight. While these guys are making good money, it's not on the Mayweather level. The movie establishes the character as rich but there's a big difference between $5 million rich and $500 million rich. Plus he wasn't tight with his money. He was buying Rolexes and cars for his buddies, not to mention legal costs; all this stuff piles up. Moreover, it's implied that the accountant and manager were taking more than their fair share.<br/><br/>People have made and lost millions and billions in real life, so how is it so implausible for some street tough – who clearly knows next to nothing about the financial world – to lose his wealth in this movie? ***END SPOILERS*** <br/><br/>The film runs 124 minutes and was shot in and around the general Pittsburgh, PA, region (Indiana University, Washington and McKeesport), as well as Las Vegas for the final act.<br/><br/>GRADE: B"

","""Southpaw"" has some powerful scenes and an eye-popping performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, but surprisingly, doesn't even try to avoid the most obvious clichés of the genre.<br/><br/>The heart of the movie is the story of a dad who loses, then struggles to regain the custody of his daughter. Jake inhabits the tough, inarticulate character of Billy Hope, a man who has fought his way up from life in an orphanage to become the World Light Heavyweight Boxing Champion.<br/><br/>The boxing setting is convincing – up to a point. The whole thing looks real with very believable ringside commentary and fighters who look the business, especially Jake who is superbly ripped and looks able to handle himself.<br/><br/>However like most boxing movies, the blows the fighters rain on each other are a bit problematic. Maybe it was the sound effects in this case, but some of the hits the guys were shrugging off would have staggered a Yeti, and stopped a real bout pretty quickly – especially at the weights they are fighting at. I say this even though Billy is supposed to be a boxer who can absorb loads of punishment before delivering the winning punch.<br/><br/>Without spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen it, the story takes an unexpected turn quite early, setting up the dilemma in Billy's life. The boxing is secondary to the story of his redemption, and interestingly, the film doesn't take much of a stance on boxing either way other than when Billy's wife, Maureen (Rachel McAdams), pleads with him to stop taking the punishment he receives in the ring.<br/><br/>In the acting stakes, Forest Whitaker gives Jake a run for his money as ex-boxer, 'Tick' Willis, who runs a gym in a tough part of town. He is an ambivalent character who doesn't always stick to his own rules. However the complexity he and the others brings to their parts helps separate this film from all the other boxing pictures we have seen – although in truth, ""Southpaw"" follows the numbers pretty closely.<br/><br/>As a boxing movie, it doesn't travel into the downbeat territory of Huston's ""Fat City"" or even Wise's noir ""The Setup"". However, the powerful performances drive through the melodrama, and ""Southpaw"" does win in the end even if it's through a series of jabs rather than a knockout blow."

","Jake Gyllenhall delivers to us an outstanding show of dedicated emotional expression and physical commitment. Yet.. It seems by the abundance of reviews that this movie was bound to fail before production had even begun. I am surprised at the vast number of comments that shame Gyllenhaal for his lackluster performance when in reality any movie of this specific genre (boxing, comeback story) will inevitably achieve. This in particular being a film full of the usual boxing training montages and unthinkable underdog final victories. The problem is that a majority of the slandering reviews of this movie are focused on that idea only; boxing. The film contains epic highs and lows that pertain to a family torn from sudden tragedy. It provides a sense of real world realization and utilizes that realization as the fuel that suddenly infamous Billy Hope needed to overcome his cumbersome vices. This film is an inspirational tool to those who need both physical and emotional motivation. Thumbs up to Gyllenhaal, Fuqua, and Eminem for this awesome production."

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","0","0","20 December 2015"," Entertaining but fails to be edgy like it presents itself
","Sports dramas are not uncommon among film studios. Almost every sport has received some kind of a film rep at some point. The most popular of these events probably would go to the boxing industry. Much of this was garnered either from actual boxing celebrities like Muhammad Ali or actors who portrayed their character in the ring like Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull (1980). Of the boxing films however, the franchise that would go down as the best known would be Sylvester Stallone's Rocky (1976) series. What worked with Stallone's franchise was how well grounded and retable its characters were. For this film, there's a certain texture that's brought to the table that not many other filmmakers could put on display for mass audiences. A combo of director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day (2001) and King Arthur (2004) and writer Kurt Sutter (Sons of Anarchy (2008) headed this visual style. And for what it's worth, everything made in this feature shows that everyone was invested in it. It still has its shortcomings though unfortunately.<br/><br/>The story is about the tragic fall and redemption of top-of-his-game boxer Billie Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) who loses his wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) after a fatal ""accident"" during a press conference. Making things worse is that his daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) is taken into child protection services. The idea itself has been seen before, but again the presentation to how viewers will see this story may feel different. Stallone's Rocky (1976) had grounded characters; so does Fuqua but he also grounds the very surroundings of the character. Even while Hope's family lives in luxury, the outside world feels gritty and cold. This is that combination mentioned earlier - Fuqua's direction and Sutter's script do a great job at demonstrating just how nasty things can get before anything gets better. That's also not excluding language and violence. Every scene has a much rougher tone to it, giving it that edge that makes it feel like its more adult oriented. Sadly this is where it falls flat in some places.<br/><br/>While it is Kurt Sutter's first screenplay, it is hard not to criticize him for penning a script with such a tough persona and yet following up with a story so safe. Perhaps this is because the premise has practically given everything away before the movie is even seen. When the only turning point in your film for the main character is when a key player is killed off, it kind of sets up the audience to already know how things will end. Everyone enjoys a well-respected return but it's also very predictable. If the loss of Hope's wife weren't announced in the premise, maybe the death would've been a little more of a throw-off than a plot setup point. So the question is, why make a script with a tone so hard edge only to play it safe like every sequel made after Rocky (1976)? Sutter's only other flaw in his script is that after Hope's loss, the subplot of his wife's murder goes unsolved. It's not even mentioned as to if Hope just wants to forget or feels the rematch was enough - but it at least should be mentioned why.<br/><br/>However, besides these clerical issues everything else does work its best to make you forget about it. Jake Gyllenhaal and Oona Laurence have believable chemistry as a young father and daughter. Gyllenhaal definitely goes all out with his tough guy persona and pulls it off. Considering he's gone through multiple transformations for a lot of his films, it's no surprise here. Even for McAdams reduced role, she too is enjoyable to watch. Plus the supporting cast is well worth it. Forest Whitaker and 50 Cent provided good contrasts to the paths Billie Hope could take and whom he sides with in success. Young actor Skylan Brooks also helps bring some development to Gyllenhaal's role. Then there are appearances from Naomie Harris and Victor Ortiz. As for Hope's main antagonist Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez), the motivations are very two- dimensional. Although they could have been more developed, the focus was on Billie, not Escobar.<br/><br/>The boxing matches were well staged and look believable too. There weren't a lot of matches for anyone who wanted a lot though. Helping make the fights feel as real as possible was Italian cameraman Mauro Fiore, who frequently works with Antoine Fuqua. Not only does Fiore keep the camera steady and only highlight what needs to be lit, but he also changes the perspective of some shots. For example, the camera will shift from a theatrical lens to found footage (but professionally) where the camera would be either Hope or Escobar's eyes during the fight. Since this involves movement, the camera won't be steady but it does give the viewer a brief minute to immerse himself or herself into the match as if it were a video game. Lastly, the music composed for the final time by James Horner before his untimely passing is not as immediately recognizable as some of his other works, but it still has its moments. The created tunes can move its audience because of the raw emotion the actors use and how the music plays out with solo piano and strings. A good last effort.<br/><br/>It does have a lot to be entertained with considering how believable the acting is, the emotional music, involving boxing matches and inventive camera-work. Yet with a tone that indulges in having less fluff, more rough, gruff, tough and buff, the script shouldn't play it so predictably. The outcome to this film can be seen even before the movie starts."

Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is impressive and proves he is one of the best actors of his generation. Nevertheless the movie is uneven and has a lot of ups and downs but at least tries to be unique focusing on the inner strangle of the hero rather than just boxing action. Of course the end of the movie is completely predictable but the way to glory is built through the hero's personal hell.

My interests seem entirely disconnected in picking a corner and praying this two piece game of chess ends in my favor of one battered and bruised being hitting the floor before the other. Outside of the millions made from entering the ring, why are these two putting gloves to flesh, blood to mat? Is there a deep context to this fight that consists of boiling blood laying so much on the line? I suppose I'm the wrong kind of person to yell and jeer over timed left hooks and right jabs, inflated egos and arrogant taunts. That's why I feel Southpaw works; it showcases the tightly shot act of boxing as well as the grandiose spectacle and grounded story behind the fighters with characters we are allowed to find hope in, even if we can't entirely relate. <br/><br/>Since boxing is a sport centered on spectacle and athleticism, it makes sense for a director like Antoine Fuqua to take the reigns, given his tendency to ask why rather than simply say because. From films like Training Day and The Equalizer, Fuqua tends to place a moral compass into the center of his spectacles, for better or worse, directing a typical crime-drama or shooter that opts to mix it up and fight southpaw. It's with this stance that we're offered an investment in the blood-shed, from south-central LA showdowns and hardware store confrontations to Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) fighting for more than a dollar. Showing us the rise and fall of Hope, we are put through a training regimen of tropes and sports clichés that jar and obscure its tonal shifts, giving us a film that feels torn between a desire to be in a heavier weight class. Southpaw places elegantly hushed jabs reminiscent of Ron Howard's Cinderella Man before exploding with a disruptive hook that careens our interest and focus away from the intimacy, falling hard into the worn genre it's working with. <br/><br/>Forest Whitaker gives a poised performance as Hope's apprehensive trainer Tick Wills, who is either a chronic liar with a dark past or an alcoholic with a penchant for fibbing. The relationship carved out of these dueling ideologies may be tattered, but it's done so with grace and zeal from two outstanding actors that it feels almost novel. The real heart of Southpaw comes from Rachel McAdams as Hope's wife Maureen and their daughter Leila (Oona Laurence). Watching McAdams shift between Hope's tough ringside companion to worried wife is seamless, working methodically to play counterpoint to Billy's wild side, one that must be tamed in order for him to regain custody of his daughter once the gloves come off. Newcomer Oona Laurence propels the film forward into the third act with a subdued power that gives us rhyme and reason to root for Hope, even if we can't help but blame him for everything. It's a story-arc that has been beaten like a dead boxer, and it certainly makes the second act a tough one to chew, but given the caliber of acting it's a mouthful worth grappling with. While Southpaw won't break new ground in a breed of sports films that beg for our impassioned attention, it's a worthy spectacle that gives more life than it loses, filling an often coarse act with tenderness and finesse."

","5.5/10 <br/><br/>In the interest of brevity, if you've seen any other ""defeated boxer makes a comeback"" film, there's absolutely no reason to see this film; Gyllenhaal's physique is the only impressive element of it (performance: ""play the dumbest guy possible"" (more or less true of any boxing film, of course)). As cliché as possible, I frankly should have known better (given the history of the director, the inclusion of 50 ""B-Movie"" Cent, and Forrest ""once near A-list, but washed up long ago"" Whittaker. Alas, hope overtook common sense, and I suffered, totally needlessly, through two hours of this idiotic, redundant mess.<br/><br/>(In other words, don't bother.) (Even more disappointingly, the Blu-Ray features include nothing, specifically, of Gyllenhaal's training regiment or body composition (weight/body fat percentage, etc.)...only that he was ""dedicated."" Ya think?)"

","If you think about it, pugilistic movies, whether you consider them a sub-genre or a genre by themselves, enjoy a high rate of success. We don't need to bring out classics such as ""Raging Bull"" or long-living TV series look-alikes such as ""Rocky"". A simple yarn as Russell Crowes's ""Cinderella Man"" (2005) has gone down smoothly for the general audience. And then, there are even boxing robots! Hugh Jackman's ""Real Steel"" (2011) has earned a remarkable 7.1 rating from IMDb users, not to mention launching talented Evangeline Lilly.<br/><br/>Two names attracted me to ""Southpaw"". One is indeed a solid lead while the other is just a little more than a cameo, and only just. When I caught some fleeting images of Rachel McAdams on the TV ""Popcorn Time"" interview, there were two movies, one about her intensive training as a cop, and the other ""Southpaw"" (the former actually turned out to be TV series ""True detective""). For ""Southpaw"", it wasn't until when I was in the cinema that I saw her die within the first 20 minutes. Still, watching her brief performance was rewarding. She plays Maureen, the wife of prizefighter Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal). Growing up together in a poverty stricken slump, this pair proves to be a winning combination of brains and muscles and a guess I do not need to elaborate on which is which. The movie truly starts when Maureen is accidentally shot dead in a confusing crowd scene where the gunman (gender presumed) was never identified, let alone apprehended.<br/><br/>I won't elaborate on the simple plot line of how Billy plunges from heaven to hell, riches to rags. His devoted 10-year-old old daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) is now taken away temporarily and assigned to the custodianship of public welfare. The deepest hurt is in Leila's alienation from a father who has ""screwed up"" (I think the language in the movie is even stronger). Redemption starts from midpoint of the movie, with Billy's headstrong determination not to give up, seeking help from top-notch trainer Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) who had shunned the lucrative business of training professionals to take up the somewhat altruistic endeavors of training deprived young men in the neighborhood. Not unexpectedly, the movie concludes in upbeat: triumph, redemption, forgiveness, reconciliation.<br/><br/>One critic, at least, cited three Oscar acting potentials and I would like to explore this. My summary line is somewhat literal as Mount Everest is definitely one of the most noticeable spots on the map. Ever since his first, and only, Oscar acting nomination a decade ago for supporting in ""Brokeback Mountain"", Gyllenhaal has tackled a large variety of roles and has generally been considered a talented actor. He does have a good number of awards but for heavyweights (no pun intended), what he has to show is only the BAFTA win for ""Brokeback Mountain"". Recently he was nominated in both Golden Globe and BAFTA for best actor in ""Nightcrawler"" (2014) but did not bring home either award. In both his recent leads, he had characters at the high end of the IQ scale, a fearless mountain guide in ""Everest"" and an unscrupulous reporter in ""Nightcrawler"". Billy Hope is at the other end of the spectrum. While not exactly taciturn, he mumbles in phrases that do not exactly articulate his thoughts. This is delivered convincingly by Gyllenhaal. His portrayal of Billy's dogged determination to win back Leila, both physically and emotionally, is touching. Playing Leila, Oona Laurence serves notice that she is the latest of the parade of wonders of child actors, too many to list. The emotional roller-coaster from devotion to alienation back to reconciliation, a challenge even for a seasoned performer, is exactly what Laurence needed to prove herself. As to seasoned performers, who is better than Whitaker to interpret the iconic trainer? The initial stern persona soon unfolds into releasing of layers of deeply buried emotions. The well-executed final climatic fight deserves mentioning but it is the performances of the aforementioned three that is the soul of this movie."

","Southpaw is really a big tribute to other boxing movies. Tick Wills is pretty much Morgan Freeman's character from Million Dollar Baby, the loss of a loved one plot point is straight out of the Rocky franchise just to name a few. However, Southpaw uses this clichés in the best way possible, they feel much more like a tribute than a ripoff or lazy writing. Jack Gyllenhaal gives a great performance once again and the child actor is surprisingly good, but apart from that no other performance stands out as above average. The direction is nothing more than competent but serves the movie well enough. Southpaw is a really fun movie that will specially appeal to fans of boxing movies."

","I'll confess to something up front - I still haven't seen Million Dollar Baby. I was put off by the boxing. This movie, however, has changed my mind - and demonstrated that a simple story told with perfect pacing can tick all the right boxes with almost any backdrop. Whilst it's a long film, there wasn't a moment which felt out of place and wasn't part of Jake's character transition as he fights with his circumstances - the dialogue seems perfectly suited and delivered at every moment.<br/><br/>Maybe my only complaint is Oona isn't given much time to explain her swings in character- it's perfectly understand if you imagine more about her story, but for a man who misses his daughter so much there is little exploration of the impact on her."

"adamlanotte","6","0","0","16 October 2015"," The final scores of the fight were impossible!
","Overall, this was a decent boxing movie and I actually praise the approach they took to focusing on the struggles of many fighters outside of the ring. While I cannot think of any story regarding a fighter to have his wife shot by an incident related to another fighter, the tragedy of losing everything is all too common in the sport. Also, many fighters come from rough, impoverished backgrounds and often return to those areas and go back to training youth. This story encapsulated the little known struggles of boxers rarely depicted in Hollywood.<br/><br/>However, for a movie that seems to aim at authenticity there were two major flaws in the movie. First, was regarding the promoter 50 cent depicted. The movie did a good job of depicting him as your typical, scandalous promoter. However, only giving 6 weeks or 8 weeks between fights for a world champion well known fighter is not accurate in the modern era of the sport. Most champions only fight twice a year, maybe three times, but often only once a year. Furthermore, the damage the movie depicted Hope taking during the fights would take several weeks, possibly over a month to fully heal before resuming training. Boxing used to operate like that, but this movie is depicting a modern era fighter and that depiction is far fetched. Also, it is a business, and most major fights need several months to be built up in the media, making the ""6 week"" notice of the final fight highly, highly unlikely.<br/><br/>Finally comes the obvious error of the movie, and shows the writer does not watch boxing very often to miss this error. The scores were impossible. It is a movie, so lets assume I cannot accurately score any round but the two rounds with knockdowns. Also, let's assume no rounds were even since under the 10 point must system there are rarely even rounds short of a point deduction (in this movie the 12th round point deduction renders that possibility impossible due to the knockdown). That means regardless of the final scores, automatically 2 points must be subtracted from escobar for the knockdown and point deduction, and 1 from hope for the knockdown. Here are the final scores: 115-113 escobar, 115-114 hope, 116-112 hope. Assuming there are no knockdowns, even rounds, or point deductions in any 12 round fight there is only a possibility of 228 combined points. Which is what the final scores in this fight represent, plus one round that must have been scored 10- 10 for the 115-114 scorecard meaning that had 229 total points. However, assuming the norm occurred as I indicated above, at best there were 225 available points to be scored.<br/><br/>115-113 for escobar represents a twelve round score with no knockdowns scored 7 rounds to 5. At best in this fight that could read 113-112 for escobar.<br/><br/>Lets assume a judge for whatever reason scored a round 10-10 for the 115-114 scorecard which means thats a 6 rounds to 5 scorecard with one even, it still could only possibly read 114-112 for hope.<br/><br/>And the final scorecard indicated a typical 8 rounds to 4 scorecard for hope, which at best should equal 115-110.<br/><br/>Such a simple error, but it is an error that is inexcusable for a movie trying to be authentic. It comes off as a lazy error where the story teller did not do his homework. As well as depicting a promoter from a different era of time between championship fights. OVerall, a good job depicting what goes on outside of the ring for many fighters. Gyllenhall, McAdams, and Whitaker gave stellar performances. The movie also did a good job depicting training when it showed it. However, the errors in how they depicted a modern promotion of a fight, scoring errors, and even how they depicted action in the ring cannot be ignored. This is after all a boxing movie. If it ended at trying to pick up the pieces after his wife's death and he did not fight again, then I can ignore the mistake. However, a major portion of the movie regarded how 50 cent promoted the fights, and the final half hour of the movie was dedicated to the fight against escobar. Therefore, the errors cannot be ignored because they brought too much attention to the actual fight and this movie failed in several ways to accurately depict a boxing match."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Southpaw"" (2015) is a movie which you basically already have seen if you ever saw ""Rocky"" or another boxing movie in style of ""Rocky"" (and not a ""Raging Bull"" or ""Million Dollar Baby"" which are a ten times better then ""Southpaw"" ). Nevertheless i was involved in this movie during the whole 2 hours, it wasn't boring for a second, it is superbly acted - Jake Gyllenhaal is simply superb in here and Forest Whitaker could receive Golden Globe nomination (this is the kind of role that looks like modeled specifically for some award). The movie is superbly paced (Antoine Fuqua is a great director), script is simple yet intriguing and very engaging. There are some emotional moments, and overall tone is also very satisfying. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Southpaw"" isn't Oscar material, but it is definitely worth your time and money.

","Where do you go? Who do you turn to? When everything that you know and stand for comes collapsing down? Sounds a muddle doesn't it? Jake Gyllenhall possibly in the most potent role of his carrier plays Billy Hope a left-handed boxer aka a SOUTHPAW. The lightweight boxing champion is brought to his knees following the sudden and heartrending demise of his wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) in the most indescribable of occurrences. Hope (no pun intended) is stripped away from everything that defines him, his wealth, his status, his sanity and his daughter Leila (Oona Laurence). Hope needs to find his self back to where he was. His biggest fight ever, a fight with himself.<br/><br/>SOUTHPAW isn't a movie about the sport of boxing. Instead it is an averagely done movie about the story of a boxer. To avoid disappointment this is the best way to sit down for this acting phenomenon. Personally I did not feel much for the entire concept of the movie. If one has watched ROCKY then I need not explain further, if one has not, then it's high time you did. However it is criminal to snub the entire motion picture away as a whole. This is the most powerful and sincere performance I have witnessed for the year 2015 and undoubtedly the best of Gyllenhall. His physical transformation from NIGHTCRAWLER alone parades his commitment. Bluntly stating his stupendous act took me by astonishment, I did not for once know he had that type versatility hidden away. This in my opinion is a promising contender for an Oscar nod come February 2016. Forest Whittaker delivers nothing short than what is expected of him. Now that is a man whom we are accustomed with for delivering powerful interpretations, with passion and sincerity, irrespective of the screenplay he is thrown into.<br/><br/>The hype prior to release and following has been enormous. There isn't anything in the screenplay or direction that would persuade me to dabble on about. It is bland and overrated as a whole in terms of the campaigning leading to the movie. The trailer misleads me to believe that this would be the movie of 2015 that would stagger me. Stagger me it did not. If you consider a screenplay being sad and making you derail emotionally as an outstanding movie then I will not stand in the way of such an opinion (Don't get me wrong, it is a beautiful movie, it just isn't best picture material). I shed a tear my self, only because of the mammoth performance by the cast who did magic with an average script. <br/><br/>A colossal performance by Jake Gyllenhall that should not be missed; a must watch.

Jake plays an undefeated boxer, Billy, who in a tragic accident loses his wife. She is shot in a scuffle between himself and another hungry boxer who wants a shot at the title. Yes, you have heard the story before so you know he crumbles emotionally, loses everything and has to get his life back on track to inevitably fight the other boxer who caused the tragedy to occur. Same old story but what sets this one apart is the exceptional performances by everyone involved in this movie. Forest Whitaker as always is great and director Fuqua turns in a brilliant job keeping all the emotions right in front of the audience to make them feel the way the characters do.

","Whenever I decide to watch a mainstream movie, I always hope to get enough satisfaction, excitement and joy. Because I believe that the first goal of a movie is to entertain and give the feeling to you in a right way. I am or the general audience is not an academy jury member and ""Southpaw"" is not an artistically estimated movie neither.<br/><br/>I can tell that the movie has that stereotype motive blended all over in its structure.But like I said, I always try not be a smartypants like the audience who has nothing to do with film business and watches few films, criticizing them as same copies of each other. The work, effort of the crew and actors, writers and everyone else is always deserve respect in this business, unless they obey the rule of honesty and only if they avoid commercial concerns, crew, actor based self-entertainment motive, which means fooling the audience with trashy and slipshod work.<br/><br/>So, after I put all these elements on the consideration of my review, I found the movie satisfying. The film bases on a success story of a boxer (Billy Hope) who has a rugged up life comes from bottom, reaches the top, falls to the bottom and gets his throne again in the end. It seemed so familiar to you too. Yes, I know. However, sometimes you watch a movie even if you know what will happen from the beginning till the end. And yes ""Southpaw"" is a kind of these movies.The attraction mostly takes place in the mid part in this kind of movies. And every time it is the deciding part. The mid part (except the beginning and the ending) showed me some different dialogues, characters and motive of a boxer that I can call them unique in comparison with all time sport movie clichés, that every one of them's must have scenes lets call it.<br/><br/>Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his elder statesman coach Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) maintains harmony and the depiction of their relationship got the best points from me. The two Star's performances is the biggest reason for the great harmonic relationship depiction for sure.<br/><br/>The other appreciative point from me goes to the physical pain and psychological pain blend's success. The both Billy's and Tick's sufferings from their miserable life and sharing that in a frame of a naive and honest friendship, Billy's remembrance of his orphanage years and his hard tries to prevent his daughter to end up like him until her adulthood, gives the feeling. And despite the Billy's story is more original and less stereotype than Tick's returning to professional Trainor life for just one match (Like many of the other sport movies) I felt sorry for him anyway, because I usually observed that in this kind of movies the returning trainer's arrogance still does exist and distance with his students stays stable. But as I said I felt sorry and pitied him maybe because of Forest Whitaker's fatherly performance and giving the soft-hearted courageous man image inside his huge and tough looking body.<br/><br/>For last words, I recommend ""Southpaw"" as a watchable movie without big expectations of a masterpiece. And it will a good choice to spend two hours if you have some spare time and you have nothing to do anything else."

","In addition to fantastic performances Southpaw has a great plot which keeps the public's attention the entire time even if it has a theme very recurring making it a bit cliché. Antoine Fuqua manages to create a movie which flows very well with scenes that carry a big emotional burden along with the ones which show the brutality and violence from the boxing's fights. Particularly the use of facial close-ups and POVs in the filming is very interesting, witnessing Billy Hope's fury explosion during the fights and the use POVs shots, the film brings the combat closer to the audience, creating greater immersion almost as if you became the boxer. The soundtrack mainly hip-hop songs is produced by Eminem, it's in charge of increasing the suspense when the act is in somehow related to the boxing matches such as the trainings or the boxing rounds themselves and the movie album surely helps to keep you on the edge of your seat. The injuries resulted from the fights is one of the details that makes the film stand out, due to the work which the makeup team did, it's impressive just how real they seem.<br/><br/>Forrest Whitaker plays Tick Wills, a strong and relentless coach. With his charisma, he delivers a solid performance, although remember the same passionate characters from his previous films. Maureen Hope (Rachel McAdams) and Leila Hope (Oona Laurence), mother and daughter respectively, their chemistry with Billy Hope(Jake Gyllenhaal) is noteworthy. Their characters are very well developed and believable, showing that the actors really committed to their roles. They also have the most tenses and heartbreaking scenes and you can feel their grief and hopelessness. Among all the good acting, Jake Gyllenhaal leaps out. His commitment to character and the body transformation made to be fit in this role are admirable. Once again, proving he's an excellent and promising actor who is capable of picking up different kinds of roles."

Luckily it isn't all that bad.<br/><br/>Personally I don't feel the world needed another generic fighting movie. Mark Wahlberg's ""The Fighter"" excelled at this formula very recently, but that was mainly due to Christian Bale's Oscar winning performance. Southpaw, unfortunately, did not have it's own Christian Bale. <br/><br/>Sure, Forrest Whitaker appears half way through the second act, but his character is not all that memorable, and the dialogue between his character and Gyllenhaal's seems clumsy and forced. It's almost like they needed to add more to the movie and just plonked in all of Whitaker's scenes to beef it up. There is an emotional part attached to the training sequence, which again, just feels like they wanted to add extra emotion and sadness and just thought ""Ahh let's make the audience feel more misery here, we just haven't made them feel miserable enough yet"".<br/><br/>The story itself is linear and requires no thought or reasoning. It is not engaging or intriguing. There are no twists or turns to watch out for, but it does stick to the hero's journey quite well. The fall from grace of the main protagonist does require an immense suspension of disbelief, for the financial questions it raises alone.<br/><br/>I felt that the exposition was jammed into my face on several occasions. An announcer stating that both the protagonist and his wife were both orphans, during a boxing match is just not sensible script writing. <br/><br/>Yes the story made me feel emotion for the character, but I pitied him. I genuinely despised him at times too. I don't believe that his redemption was hard fought enough and his self revelation was practically none existent. He is practically the same character at the end of the fight as he was at the beginning. He really doesn't learn all that much. The daughter character actually has a real self revelation and grows through the story, which I'm sure was not the writer's intention. <br/><br/>Finally, the term Southpaw is a misnomer and again, I feel it was jammed in at the end, when they couldn't think of a catchy enough soundbite. I'll be honest, it did work on me, but it was a very orthodox movie in every way and apart from the impressive physical transformation that Jake Gyllenhall went through; there wasn't much to take notice of.<br/><br/>It kept my attention for the timespan barely, but this was not the knockout I was looking for unfortunately."

","If you saw any boxing movie before, you seem them, all. This movie is no differs. Directed by Antonie Fuqua, and written by Kurt Sutter, the film tells the story of pro-fighter Billy 'The Great' Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) trying to turn his around, on after losing his wife in a tragic accident and his daughter to child protection services. Can Billy Hope win this fight or will he lose his family for good? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, I found that this sports drama to be pretty bland. Very unoriginal. To start with, if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. It was unbelievably predictable. It has every boxing film standard; the everyman fighter, the ultra-supportive wife, the rags to riches, riches to rags, type storyline culminating in the fight of the century. The film was originally considered as an unofficial follow-up to the 2002's movie, 8 Mile with Eminem reprising his role as Jimmy 'B-Rabbit' Smith, becoming a professional boxer, instead of a rapper. Eminem even accepted the role and started to get ready to film a few scenes, only to back out of it, during the early stages of production. Since, Eminem wanted to focus on his music career, the idea of the 8 Mile sequel was scrapped. The role was then given to Jake Gyllenhaal, where the script eventually evolved into the film, that it is, today. Southpaw still does features a hard-driving hip-hop soundtrack by Eminem that meshes perfectly with jump-roping scenes and footwork-and-punching practice. The music was surprising, mixed very well, with the rest of the film. I have to say, the movie was beautifully shot. Great work from Antonie Fuqua. The acting in this movie, not so much. Don't get me wrong, Jake Gyllenhaal did an okay job acting, but he was totally unbelievable as a boxer, even after getting trained by pro-boxer, Miguel Cotto. Honestly, what type of pro-boxer, doesn't know, a little bit of defense!? It doesn't make sense. I have to say, his look was pretty good, for the most part. It was a huge accomplishment to get from playing an uber skinny man, a year ago in 2014's Nightcrawler to being totally ripped in this film. I give him, props for that, even if it's unhealthy as hell, to lose and gain that much weight in a short period of time. Still, it's not enough, to say, that his performance was great. Yes, he's ferocious and yet vulnerable, but I can't help, laughing at some of the character's deep dark moments in the movie, due to how over-the-top unsympathetic, his performance was. One thing that I didn't like about the film is that his character's metamorphosis from unlikeable immature boy to well-mannered adult, really comes out of nowhere. He and Rachel McAdams share a great chemistry, together on film, but sadly, it was short-lived. Rachel McAdams on her own, wasn't that great. Her death scene was a bit, silly. Oona Laurence as Billy Hope's kid, Leila Hope was mostly alright, but the way, she acted and look, remind me, way too much of the character, Margo from 2010's animation film, Despicable Me. Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson was in the film, as Billy's manager, but he rarely add anything to the story. Forest Whitaker gives a crucial performance in this movie, as Tick Willis, Billy's new trainer. By far, he had the best performance in the film. The scene, where he's reacting to somebody's death was very memorable. Still, the movie lacks the heart of something like the Rocky series, or the smarts of 1980's Raging Bull. One of the biggest problems of the film is how uneven, it was. It really got unbelievable at times. I really don't know, how a man can go from being pay millions of dollars for prize fights to nearly bankrupt. There was no even flow from one situation to another. There needs to be more plausible reasons to explain the chain of events that leads to a person's downfall. The accidental shooting of his wife, I understand, but the loss of all his money and losing custody of his daughter in less than a few months was just a little to convenient. The premise needed a few more works. Overall: In my opinion, this was just a satisfying heart-tugging comeback story, that could had been great, but end up, being pretty mediocre. It didn't fight hard enough."

","The low average, ultra-generic-characters-filled, ridiculously clichéd sports drama this movie could have easily ended up being, is saved by a couple of amazing and committed performances, a couple of smart storytelling turns and another couple of very well placed directorial choices.<br/><br/>Yet, I emphasize, there is no two ways around what I said in the opening. This movie is filled with generic characters whose drama has been seen and told on screen so many times it is hard to even believe someone is still interested in telling these stories. The opening fifteen minutes of the film were an agony of mediocrity and clichés I was really about to give up. There is nothing surprising about these people, nothing unpredictable, as soon as they appear on screen you understand everything about them and have no space left for shock and surprise.<br/><br/>Despite everything above, Gylenhall, one of my personal heroes ever since Donnie Darko, is so committed and so absorbed into the moment you forget everything around him is as fake as it would sound and gives you the exact ingredient needed for you to be following him. Even though the movie built around him isn't believable he totally gives gravity to it and truly, single handily makes turn this film from a cringe worthy failure to a relatively satisfying experience. It is so good to see an actor pay off so much on screen. His daughter in the movie definitely helps and she too does deliver the type of commitment needed for the audience to believe in her emotions and her relation with her father. These emotions you get from almost all the main cast are definitely made possible by Fuqua's direction in the vital emotional beats. He knows exactly how to make us get the feels and I must admit whole heartedly I got them.<br/><br/>On the other hand however, for the rest of the film both Fuqua's and the screenplay's decisions make it trip too many times. On one side Fuqua doesn't hold back, he blows up everything to eleven and does not even once give space to subtlety. He shoves the emotions down are throats. As I said before, thanks to the performances especially, you do get the feels and feel the gut-wrench the movie thinks you should, but it also feels utterly manipulative. Furthermore, the screenplay simply could not have had more clichés condensed into 124 minutes.<br/><br/>This is no break from the usual, generic sports movie, but thanks to some really passionate work by the filmmakers it doesn't end up being nothing close to a waste of time."

","Now when it comes to the plot, it's actually a very generic boxing movie that isn't all that believable. Watching this movie was like watching a boxing fairytale. It's like watching ""Rocky"" except ""Rocky"" just seemed like a movie to invest more emotionally compared to this one. Despite the fact that their is a lot of emotions from the characters in this film. This was suppose to be movie inspired by Eminem's life story, except told in boxing form. Em was actually given a chance to play the role, except he turned it down. Jake Gyllenhaal is a good actor and I did like his portrayal of this broken down boxer that goes from having everything to losing almost everything. He simply did solid job of playing this boxer with this ghetto demeanor going for him. The plot is about a boxer that has to start from the bottom to get to the top again. The thing is, there is just better boxing movies out there that is worth watching compared to this one. However, I will say it does have this inspirational vibe going for it, to not give up and keep on fighting. I liked that. I also liked the ghetto vibe going for this movie and the crisp boxing cinematography. I was looking for more depth to the story or something that really leaves an impact, but you won't find it in this film. Overall, this is a good boxing movie with a solid performance from Jake Gyllenhaal. It's not a performance that is engraving, but it's solid enough.<br/><br/>7.1/10"

","Southpaw is directed by Antoine Fuqua (training day) and stars Jake Gyllenhaal so I was quite excited to see this movie I was not disappointed. It is well directed and both Gyllenhaal and Withaker both deliver very good performances. The score is good, I like the feel of the film and you really root and feel for the main character. I know some people criticize this movie for being formulaic. This doesn't really bother me much because the only formulaic part of the movie is his boxing career but that's not what this movie is about. This movie is about the boxer himself and what he goes through. Great movie.<br/><br/>10/10"
"namashi_1","10","2","5","29 August 2015"," What. A. Punch.
","Antoine Fuqua's 'Southpaw' is electrifying stuff! It rides very high on emotions & pure drama. It sure is predictable & takes a route we've seen before, but the treatment & the performances, make this recent release a film to reckon with.<br/><br/>'Southpaw' Synopsis: Boxer Billy Hope turns to trainer Tick Willis to help him get his life back on track after losing his wife in a tragic accident and his daughter to child protection services.<br/><br/>I Loved 'Southpaw'. Its a tale with a soul. It isn't pointlessly mellow or overtly sensitive. This isn't just a story about a man, its about a husband, a father, a friend & a boxer. It captures the struggle & dedication of its protagonist & how he bounces back when life knocks him out. Its Modern-Day Rocky, with a more violent touch.<br/><br/>Kurt Sutter's Screenplay is inspiring & thoroughly engaging. I never disconnected with the story, I was involved & moved by it. Fuqua's Direction is razor-sharp. 'Southpaw' is among his best works to date. Cinematography is well-done. Editing is finely done. The Choerography of the Boxing-Fights is very good. The Late/Great James Horner's Score is perfect. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Jake Gyllenhaal is the heart & soul of 'Southpaw'. The immensely talented & fearless actor transforms himself (his physique is wow) & emotes remarkably. After sterling performances in Nightcrawler & Enemy recently, Gyllenhaal triumphs yet again! He reminded me of a younger Stallone & that's saying a lot. Forest Whitaker is another topper. Though he enters the scene pretty late, the acting giant dominates the screen, while complementing Gyllenhaal at every step. Rachel McAdams is affecting & beautiful in a brief role. Oona Laurence is outstanding; Its a powerhouse performance. Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson & Naomie Harris are decent. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Southpaw' will leave you pumped, by its sheer energy & power. Very Strongly Recommended!"
"larcenymail","10","2","5","28 August 2015"," Best boxing movie, amazing cinematography, better emotions!
","Easily the best boxing movie I have ever seen. And quite possibly the best movie I have seen in a long time. One thing for sure, is that I cried during this movie more than any other movie. That must mean that they did an excellent job with this movie, I wasn't boring at all. It was extremely uplifting. This blows away Rocky, the first one. The level of acting performed by Jake is leaps and bounds better than Stallone, Jake shows so much emotion, albeit with modern effects and cinematography its easier to make a better movie. But this plot in Southpaw, it manages to turn something completely unoriginal into a original masterpiece. I liked the training scenes, and i loved Whittakers voice. ""Jab.... Jab..... left..... right..... one two"" SO I vote 10/10, because this is the best movie in its class, by a uppercut!"
"xaleber","8","2","5","27 August 2015"," OK, I just witnessed one of the greatest performances of the 21st century.
","Some say the movie is formulaic. I agree with that. It is formulaic and at times clichéd, but the performances are unbelievable. Oona Laurence gives an incredible performance that is so believable and heartbreaking. And, of course, the champ, the king, Jake Gyllenhaal. To describe his performance is to count drops of rain. He took acting to a whole other level with this performance and proved himself as the greatest actor of his generation. I never thought I'd say it, but he surpassed DiCaprio...Big Time. 50, Forest and everybody give good performances. So here is my opinion of the film: As a performance and directing work, it is amazing. As a good story and all that, it falls. Since I am a fan of boxing , I am biased. So this 9/10 maybe inaccurate for some people. Bravo Gyllenhaal."
"Troy_Campbell","8","2","5","26 August 2015"," Clichéd, but entertaining and hard hitting.
","The boxing sub-genre of sports movies boasts some pretty remarkable motion pictures: Raging Bull, Million Dollar Baby, Rocky, Cinderella Man, The Hurricane and The Fighter. And whilst Antoine Fuqua's (Training Day, The Equalizer) latest effort doesn't quite reach the top of that pile, it sits comfortably amongst them as a fight flick with tremendous heft. First and foremost though, this is Jake Gyllenhaal's film. His transformation, both physically and mentally, into the emotionally complex pugilist Bobby Hope is a tour de force that, with any justice, will garner him his second Oscar nomination (after 2006's Brokeback Mountain). Even during some of the weaker parts – most notably the elongated middle act that meanders intermittently – Gyllenhaal's invested performance drives proceedings and commands your attention. Also in the movie's corner is 11-year-old Oona Laurence as Hope's daughter Leila. She's a wonderful sparring partner for Gyllenhaal and their scenes together are authentic, affecting and ultimately the beating heart behind the blood, sweat and tears. Fuqua again presents a world defined by urban grit, with Mauro Fiore's grimy, almost black and white photography combining with a hip-hop soundtrack to generate a tough, street-level atmosphere. The script from Kurt Sutter doesn't elevate the story as much as it could have, with rags-to-riches clichés and predictable plot beats on full display, yet there's a sincerity here that makes it work. Not to mention the fights are gloriously executed, creating an intensity and fierceness that ensures each showdown - especially the climactic match – is immersive and adrenaline pumping. Anchored by a riveting central turn and boxing sequences that, umm, pack a real punch, Southpaw is an entertaining and hard-hitting drama that earns its place in the higher echelon of sports films."

Jake becomes the person from the script, completely. This guy has grown in his profession beyond what it is named.

"scottjohnson7896","7","2","5","27 July 2015"," A Few Good Punches
","The boxing film Hall of Fame holds great works like Raging Bull, Rocky, and Million Dollar Baby. Each of these films takes a different approach, making them feel like their own unique combatant. Southpaw, the new film from Antoine Fuqua, takes the best parts of each of these films and meshes them together into a sort of ""greatest hits"" of boxing movies, resulting in a film that tries too hard to be what was successful which prevents it from being a true contender among the greats. But that doesn't stop it from getting in a few good punches, especially in its cathartic fight scenes and tremendous performances.<br/><br/>Riding high on the success of his 43rd victory in a row, Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal in an astounding performance,) finds his world completely shattered after the murder of his wife and the loss of his child to Protective Services. Gyllenhaal continues on his triumphant streak after Nightcrawler in what is yet another performance that proves he is one of the best and most versatile actors working in Hollywood. Just like in Nightcrawler, he dives deep into the role, looking like a boxer in the process while also being hardly recognizable as himself. He captures the ""punch-drunk"" dialogue perfectly, making it feel like he really has been hit in the head too many times. His biggest downfall is his explosive anger, which benefits him in the ring but causes issues outside, and Gyllenhaal delivers these moments with ferocious depth.<br/><br/>While the film gives Gyllenhaal a lot to work with, there isn't much for the others to gnaw on. Rachel McAdams, who plays Billy's wife, Maureen, is hardly in it, though she makes us wish she was with her few brief scenes before her murder. Oona Laurence, a young actress who manages to steal the scene away from Gyllenhaal, is marvelous as his daughter, Leila. Though we do not see much of her life in CPS, she delivers some heartbreaking moments full of the bitterness she feels for the situation she has been forced into. Forest Whitaker, though he takes the mentorship role of Billy in his attempts to get back on top, does not get a fully developed character that makes us feel any attachment to. He appears partway through the movie with all the clichés of your average filmic boxing trainer and his backstory is hardly explained so we wonder why he has any sort of relevance to Billy's situation.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, Southpaw takes a bunch of different elements from the greats and tries to tie them all together into a cohesive film. It has the downfall of a great fighter like in Raging Bull and his attempts to regain his glory; the underdog aspect of Rocky; the spectacle of The Fighter; and the unfortunate circumstances and loss of everything of Cinderella Man. Some of these elements work well together, but it just doesn't allow it to be its own film. The pacing is skewed at times, especially in the rushed climax where it steals from Rocky to give us a training montage and then an immediate cut to the big fight. Another issue is that one of the most important issues raised in the film is never actually resolved, making us wonder if they forgot to include it or if it even mattered in the first place. Yet, the moments where Southpaw feels original are in its intense emotional interactions that leave you drained, and its final fight scene which is shot with some excellent cinematography.<br/><br/>Getting into the ring with Southpaw you will be able to read the punches and catch its pattern pretty quickly. There are some surprise punches here or there, but without Gyllenhaal and a few impactful moments, it would be a fight that ends in a knockout within the first couple rounds. The bell has rung on this fight, and the judges are calling it a draw."
"ali_jafar","9","2","5","26 July 2015"," Great Film!
","Jake Gyllenhaal is a brilliant actor and the way he portrayed Billy Hope in Southpaw was breathtaking. It's the best boxing film in decades, probably the best since Rocky. Sure, the story had its share of clichés but, hey, nothings perfect. Rachel and Jake's chemistry throughout the film is believable and the way it is directed is amazing. Forest Whitaker plays a vital supporting role as a boxing instructor. The fight scenes are incredibly realistic and the choreography is well- done. The director does a great job, though considering he directed The Equalizer and Training Day that was obvious. The dialogue needed a bit of touch but, dude, our man Jake's presence takes it away. All in all, its one heck of a great film!"
"abouhelier-r","9","2","5","25 July 2015"," Southpaw
","Boxer Billy Hope turns to trainer Tick Willis to help him gets his life back on track after losing his wife in a tragic accident and his daughter to child protection services. <br/><br/>Directors sure do love a boxing ring, that great square where (usually) two men face off in a battle that is often about more than sport. The ring is a great place to put a camera and there's the obvious, easy metaphor that boxing provides: the fight, you see, is really the fight of life. Many venerable Hollywood's directors - Scorsese, Eastwood, Mann or Howard - have (thanks to Sylvester Stallone maybe) made boxing pictures for that particular reason. The think is that there's so much contain within the bounds of those ropes, all the struggle and triumph and defeat of life, neatly compressed into 12 rounds. This movie is one of those film you think can't get worse but it does, it really got worse for this guy in this story of rise-and-fall- and-rise-again. Their daughter evolves into a central character as the film goes on and the legal system seems equally cold and unjust as money-grabbing fight organisers, in taking Leila away from him; though it also motivates Billy to mature into a responsible dad. By now you've probably heard a lot about Jake Gyllenhaal's astonishing physical transformation, to a point where he's even hard to recognise in the opening shots. But generally speaking the cast is incredible, they're all great actors. Harvey Weinstein loudly speculated at earliest Cannes Film Festival preview that Gyllenhaal would receive at least an Oscar nomination for his breathtaking transformation here, partly as ""revenge"" for previous snub in the best actor race for last year Nightcrawler. <br/><br/>Spectacle of Gyllenhaal throwing himself into the role of Billy Hope with a sort of abandon that makes even his creepy, Gollum-like part in last year Nightcrawler look like a drama class exercise by comparison. He's never looked tougher on screen. In fact, he's virtually unrecognisable here, which in this case is more than enough to satisfy the expectations of a truly great performance. It's in fact a solid piece of acting, one that never lets us forget every ounce of effort he should have went for into achieving it. Billy's character is thrilling to watch and the only unpredictable thing in this 2-hours-plus-movie. Gyllenhaal manages to give his character a raw inner fierce, he turns his pain into an unarticulated rage. You get the sense that the ring is a place where he finds peace through oblivion. You can practically smell the blood, the sweat and the fierce rising from Jake Gyllenhaal bruised and tattooed body. When his character is in emotional agony, you got it, you know it, you feel it and you're there. He created something complex and arresting at the same time, within the character of Billy. That's more impressive than anything the actor's achieved with his personal trainer. He's hands down a fantastic actor even with this relevant physical appearance. Moreover, Rachel McAdams has more to do than I worried she would, and is, slightly better than the material. She gives Maureen more tangible humanity than her ""I'm worried about you, baby"" character might otherwise get. I loved Forest Whitaker in the role of the rough old trainer with a heart of gold as well. Particularly a scene where he points to Billy's fists and says ""Boxing isn't about this. It's about this. It's a game of chess."" pointing to his head. <br/><br/>However, there's nothing truly out of the box in this competent and effective first screenplay by Sons of Anarchy creator, Kurt Sutter. The second act slows down for some growing up time away from the ring. The action scenes are pumped up and the emotional time-outs smoothed over softly with James Horner's last score that ranges from moody to rap. The boxing scenes themselves are dynamically lanced and cut, always seeking to position the viewer in the midst of it through wide array of camera angle. Especially the climatic fight between Billy and his mortal enemy, is appropriately brutal and undeniably exciting. Finally when it's done well this film involves nuance and the subtle submission of self - which are imperceptible and utterly mysterious. <br/><br/>Overall Southpaw may be thudding around from cliché to cliché and lack of narrative agility but when it gets to the ring, it knows just what to do. It's all about the fight, the rest is just hype."
"MediaPanther","6","2","5","24 July 2015"," Could Have Been A Contender
","Southpaw comes at you from many directions, but does it connect? That's what Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Olympus Has Fallen) and crew are pinning their housenotes on in their take on the world of boxing.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal plays an amped up throwback of both the boxing and human variety and puts in an excellent portrayal. Billy Hope (Gyllenhaal) is the light-heavyweight world champ with a great wife and cute little daughter to support him. The only problem is he might be getting a bit too mature for taking on shots to the dome and should stop. Unfortunately he doesn't want to.<br/><br/>Fans of the ""sweet science"" on film will certainly like the look and feel of Southpaw. Colors are crisp, camera angles, edits, choreography and cinematography especially during the fight segments are well above average. Besides these aspects, film fans in general might like other components of the film from set and costume design (except maybe Curtis Jackson's character), to the music and acting. If you don't like realistic boxing sequences, then close your eyes for the fight scenes. No to worry, there are some performances worth watching outside of the ring.<br/><br/>As Billy's business savvy wife, Rachel McAdams should have been included more. Maureen is sassy, sexy, smart and cares deeply about her family. McAdams looks and acts the part without a hitch, but the plot goes in a different direction. About two thirds into Southpaw, Billy goes under the tutelage of Tick Willis (Forest Whitaker) to take on bouts for money and for a job. Whitaker is great as (of course) a gruff, world weary gym owner, mentor, trainer. The interplay between Tick and Billy are one of the saving graces of Southpaw. Thanks to Kurt Sutter, these characters get off some of the films best dialog and one liners. Billy showing up at one of Tick's haunts and the responses during his outbursts are prime examples.<br/><br/>As briefly mentioned Gyllenhall is amazing in Southpaw. If you hear comparisons to De Niro or Stallone, that may be about right. Billy is the guy you want to root for. You feel for him in more ways than one, one of which is probably because he's a little off. The guy mumbles and your not sure if he's punch drunk and then you realize that he's not sure either. Besides his almost incomprehensible speech, he's wound tight. At one moment an almost homicidal maniac, then training kids how to move their feet in the ring. From his posture, speech, mannerisms, to throwing a punch, Gyllenhaal did his homework.<br/><br/>Still there are perhaps glaring deficiencies in Southpaw. There is something that doesn't seem authentic. Most disconcerting would be the lack of medical professionals surrounding Billy Hope's world and boxing in general. Every time there's a shot of him in the locker room after a fight, there are no doctors to be found. The guy takes on a beating, blood coming out of his mouth, eye swollen shut, but nobody taking a look at him? Not to mention doing a scan every once in a while to make sure his brain hasn't turned to oatmeal. Would it have put the film over budget to cast a doctor or two? There are no weigh ins, only one press conference where there should be one before every fight, if not to make it more entertaining between combatants. The verbal fight before the actual fight. Then there's the issue of his little girl (nice job by Oona Laurence) at home by herself. They show her with someone who may be a nanny one time, other than that she is alone in the family's huge mansion for stretches of the film. She even rides in a limousine by herself after a funeral while her dad sits on a hill. No follow up on the murder of a key player? Nitpicking? Maybe, but these and other omissions detract from vaulting Southpaw to the next level.<br/><br/>If you are able not to scrutinize Southpaw too much, it is a very good film. Gyllenhaal's whirling dervish performance will cover up a lot of the missteps. Unfortunately, the filmmakers failed to focus on other aspects that could have put it along some of the greats of the genre.<br/><br/><ul><li>See more at: http://www.mediumraretv.org/review/southpaw/#sthash.J0U0ov3U.dpuf</li></ul>"

It's similar to Sly Stallone's Rocky, but not as impressive in comparison.<br/><br/>I like Forest Whitaker's role in the movie as the Mr. Miyagi styled boxing coach, who teaches Billy how to win without taking so many hits, as he like to do. The boxing training scenes were low key but fun to watch. Especially watching the aftermath of this training and seeing it implemented in the ring was unique and interesting. <br/><br/>The relationship between Billy Hope and his daughter also added some freshness to the whole story.

","SOUTHPAW is an interesting drama about a boxer, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who loses everything when tragedy strikes and must redeem himself. The best thing about the film is easily the performances. Jake Gyllenhaal did an excellent job in the leading role as he played a flawed, multi-dimensional but (in part) sympathetic boxer who hits rock bottom and tries to redeem himself. I also thought the supporting cast was great as well--Forest Whitaker's role was good, the child actress who plays Gyllenhaal's daughter nearly stole the show, and Rachel McAdams' performance was powerful and showed some solid emotional depth. Speaking of emotional depth, the film is also very emotionally deep because it is more personal than you would guess (it shows 'up-close' the downward spiral and redemption of its protagonist,) which enhanced the film in my opinion. However, I thought the film had some flaws as well. The film's pacing seemed too fast in some scenes, particularly in the second and third acts. The script has a few issues as well: there were a few lines where the dialogue tried to be very frank but it comes off as silly, and a few lines that were meant to be ironic but don't really come off as irony to the viewer based on the context of the scene. Finally, the plot is quite predictable. That said, I thought this was a worthwhile and generally well-made film despite the flaws I mentioned. It's not a masterpiece, but it's good, and I do recommend seeing it."

I just loved Gyllenhaal in this.<br/><br/>Sadly, much of the rest of the film doesn't stand up nearly as well. The script is good but highly predictable. (I was able to say lines before they happened). The story is overcooked and goes too dark in places. Hops' fate was hugely overwrought. Too much of the time this story feels depressing for the sake of depression. It is engaging but a shadow of what could have been.<br/><br/>The fights are good but not as engaging as lot of other boxing movies. There was too much subjective POV camera work in the fights and the editing rhythm doesn't seem to build right.<br/><br/>This is a good film but it is no Creed."
"Oberrated","9","1","2","21 April 2016"," Fantastic
","As the audience, this film does so well drawing us in and making us feel like we are living Billy's life. Without spoiling the events that happen, we experience his most dark moments when he is at rock bottom with next to nothing left. We experience every emotion possible from his tear-jerking sadness, to his fierce frustration, to his undeniable drive during his comeback. This movie is not just a sports movie. It is not just the next comeback boxing movie. It is a comeback in life movie. It is a movie that shows even when life is at its worst possible outcome. With enough drive, determination, and the fear of losing someone you love staring you right in the face Any comeback is possible."
"deloudelouvain","8","1","2","17 January 2016"," One of the better boxing movies
","Definitely one of the better boxing movies I ever saw. Not only for the sport but also the story behind it. The story of the boxer Billy Hope (played beautifully by Jake Gyllenhaal) that wins everything and is at the top of his career when suddenly he loses everything and has to fight back to get his life back on track. The struggle, the comeback, the fights are all very pleasant to watch. With Jake Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker together you can't go wrong. They are both really good in Southpaw. Even if you don't really like boxing the movie is still pleasant to watch. I for sure did enjoy Southpaw a lot and can only recommend it."

","I give this film 8 our of 10 stars because it's a bit predictable at the end BUT I won't spoiler it like some folks on here. That is just rude and I hate when people do that so I won't. Now the film itself is about a light heavy weight champ who's wife gets killed-that's in the trailer by the way so that's NOT a spoiler-and is fighting to get his daughter and life back in order. I liked the acting of Jake Gyllenhaal who really made you feel for Billy Hope. I think he might get an Oscars nomination for Best Actor this year but if Eddie Redmayne gets a nomination for The Danish Girl or Will Smith for Concussion then he won't win. Sorry Jake but crying over your wife dying body isn't going to win you anOscar unless your Tom Hanks or Denzel. But anyways the little girl I really loved her performance she really made you feel so sorry for her because of what she was going through. I saw this film on Redbox so if you want to see a good boxing film, rent it, you'll like it. Trust me."

","Billy Hope (Gyllenhaal) is the Light Heavyweight Champion of the World. In a bizarre accident his wife Maureen (McAdams) is killed. He has another fight and cannot concentrate and loses. Then he is told by financial advisers that he is out of money. All now is lost: his house, cars etc and also his daughter, 8-year old Leila (Oona Laurance), now must go into Family Protection Services. He is devastated but goes on a path of self-destruction. . He must find a way to get back to doing what he loves and get his daughter back. He meets Tick Willis (Whitaker) who reluctantly agrees to train him. <br/><br/>Just what we need: another fight movie that we know is going to be very sad. And that is just what we have now and I was prepared not to like this movie. However, the pull for me turned out to be the relationship between Billy and daughter Leila. Yes, we see Billy train hard to get back and he does a good job of that, but the strained relationship with Leila tugs at our heart strings. <br/><br/>To be fair Gyllenhaal as Billy has fully invested himself in here with both the training and getting his daughter back. Some say an Oscar is in his future. The fight scenes are brutal and looked more than real, but the visits to Family Services to get estranged Leila back is uppermost in his mind. Ours too. <br/><br/>If you watch keep a box of Kleenex handy. There will be moments<br/><br/>(what's wrong, you now seem to like the movie?) Here's the thing: Billy's wife was his manager and she would not have let their finances get so low. This part of the movie when he is told he is broke came too quickly in a very short period of time as the movie just opened. Just seemed too contrived. <br/><br/>When Tick Willis comes on the scene I thought maybe that he would convince Billy to sue his financial advisors for stealing from him, but that didn't happen. Instead Tick just trained Billy and actually taught him how to box and not act like a street thug in the ring. <br/><br/>Tick convinces Billy to hit southpaw, but this looked awkward with Billy hunching up his left shoulder to protect his left side and eye. Billy didn't look like a left hander in the ring. There didn't seem to be any room for Billy to land a knockout punch with his left hand. Like I said: awkward. Actually, the title should have been Redemption or Hope's Redemption. <br/><br/>One more thing. When a character like Tick, the Trainer, wants to give hushed advice to his boxer, the Director should remember there is an audience that needs to hear this advice. Often Tick's whispers couldn't be understood. <br/><br/>So .. not bad, but the relationship with the daughter was the pull for me, the fights were okay and brutal. This is not the blockbuster some have made it out to be. And don't forget, we need to get past CREED. Ha! (7/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes."
"awoelkers","8","1","2","8 December 2015"," Inter turmoil of the Characters
","Something I find very intriguing throughout the movie is how both Tick and Billy struggle internally with their own individual problems. Billy is struggling with his violent tendencies while also frequently bursting out in anger. After his wife is shot, Billy is humbled to the point of remaining a shadow of what he once was. Tick also deals with his own personal inner turmoil. When he finds out that Hoppy dies, Tick is venting and saying how he should have protected him. Tick then says ""God must have some kind of plan to teach me some kind of lesson. I just can't figure out what it is."" It is very curious that throughout the movie, there is no real mention of religion. However, at Tick's most vulnerable and ""deepest"" part of the movie, he throws out the concept that God has a plan. What makes Tick suddenly refer to God? After this scene, there is one more mention of religion when Tick tells Billy that God is watching him. What makes Tick mention religion?"

","I have always loved films which are on boxing and boxers. But i think this movie is let down and overrated. Its also about his relation b/w Billy Hope and his daughter but the movie was bit dragging. It is also not free from the usual clichés you expect in this kinda films. It was also irritating to see Gyllenhall doing this role, i think someone else would have conveyed the role better. The acting of the supporting actors was good especially Oona Lawrence, and Forest Whittaker not in his best. Background music was was quite good and the cinematography average.

","Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a sports boxing realistic Drama, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off. <br/><br/>Since new spin-off Rocky movie Creed (2015) was been released and I am against it for ruing and killing off my Rocky balboa character including all movies I decide to watch a Boxing Sports Drama movies. Southpaw was the first Boxing movie in 2015 I saw since Rocky. I am not a big fan of Jake Gyllenhaal and his movies, recently I just watched Nightcrawler (2014) and I hated that movie since everyone is praising it. But I did like Donnie Darko (2001), Jarhead (2005), Zodiac (2007) and Prisoners (2013). This movie surprised the hell out of me. What I mean with that, this movie was portrayed In realistic Boxing drama since Rocky about an human man's life. At times, you feel like you're watching a documentary on a real man's life. It's that much realistic. I had no idea that actors portrayed and acted so good, that it feel realistic to me. I am sorry if you don't agree with me, but I think this movie is miles away better than Creed. I love drama movies portraying a human's life a man's, boy's, girl's or woman's it doesn't matter as long the acting is good. In here the acting and portraying a human Boxing sports Drama is good and convincing. <br/><br/>This movie isn't masterpiece but it is so much good. I am also not a big fan of Antoine Fuqua movies but Southpaw become my favorite realistic Boxing drama movies alongside Rocky, Million Dollar Baby and Rocky Balboa. My favorite movies of Antoine are: The Replacement Killers (1998) and Training Day (2001), those two movies are good. Denzel Washington is my favorite actor. The actors everyone does a great job. Especially Forest Whitaker as coach Tick Wills, he was awesome and did a believable acting, I have ever seen. I still remember him from Bloodsport (1988) as Agent Rawlins. The man still can act and he made of 100 movies. Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing as always but so were Forrest Whitaker, Rachel McAdams, and the actress Oona Laurence who played the daughter. It had a great story focusing on dealing with grief, anger, and maturity as well as controlling your destiny and not letting your emotions overtake you. the fight scenes were well done as well. It was a little cliché but hey if it ain't broke don't fix it. The film focus more on one man's struggling trough hard time in life. <br/><br/>A World Light Heavyweight boxing champion loses everything after his wife was accidentally murdered. He loses his property, his self respect, respect from his fans, he loses his next fight, loses all money and the court takes him his daughter away and gives her to a social service, he may lose her forever. The man who was guilty for his wife's death walks free smiling and wins the title. This movie is about a hardest fight in the man's life. He has to fight against all odds. He need to get his daughter back and he needs to train and get's self respect including avenging his wife's death. The training sequence are awesome and I have never saw any training sequences in any movie not even the technique Billy was using in a movie like that. I only saw one technique different used in Rocky IV movie. <br/><br/>Billy Hope seemingly has it all with an impressive career, a beautiful and loving wife (Rachel McAdams), an adorable daughter (Oona Laurence) and a lavish lifestyle. When tragedy strikes and his lifelong manager and friend (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) leaves him behind, Hope hits rock bottom and turns to an unlikely savior at a run-down local gym: Tick Willis (Academy Award winner Forest Whitaker), a retired fighter and trainer to the city's toughest amateur boxers. With his future riding on Tick's guidance and tenacity, Billy enters the hardest battle of his life as he struggles with redemption and to win back the trust of those he loves.<br/><br/>That is the main basic plot and it is not all about boxing and fight, but it is about struggling life and his only living family member, his own daughter. I love this movie and gets a perfect 10 for me. Southpaw is an excellent boxing Sports Drama film from beginning to end. Give it a chance. <br/><br/>Southpaw is a 2015 sports drama film directed by Antoine Fuqua, written by Kurt Sutter, and starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Forest Whitaker, and Rachel McAdams.

"alin-patru","9","1","2","3 December 2015"," ""Too many punches straight into his face...""
","I see a lot of people saying this is a bad movie cause an undefeated champion is taking a lot of punches straight into his face and he isn't able to block, which doesn't make sense in the professional world of boxing. In my opinion this isn't an error and it's set on purpose. Probably it wants to give the idea that even if he gets hit straight into his face, he keeps fighting and trying, knowing that as in life, if you are there at the right spot and time, even if you might be behind, you should never give up because you can have a great come back. More than that, later on, his life is taking a wrong turn and he loses everything, but again, he never gives up, he probably took a ""K.O"", but he gets up, fights and believes he can make. Another important thing this movie shows us is that, in life, you might be good in what you are doing, but in order to be the best, you need someone to ""complete"" you. He had his wife in his day by day life, but in his main activity it wasn't the same. Now he meets the missing part and he goes to the top and guess what took him there..."

"CinemaClown","Null","1","2","27 November 2015"," Predictable, Formulaic & Overly Melodramatic, Southpaw Fails To Deliver The Knockout Punch.
","Predictable, formulaic & overly melodramatic at times, Southpaw is a cliché-ridden sports drama that may not have anything new to add to its genre but thanks to Jake Gyllenhaal's brawny performance, it manages to redeem itself to an extent and while the drama remains stale for the most part, it is able to derive some entertainment from its boxing matches.<br/><br/>The story of Southpaw follows an undefeated professional boxer whose life is turned upside down when his wife is shot & killed in a brawl that erupts between him & an up-and-coming boxer. The devastating incident leads him on the path of self-destruction but when he loses the custody of his daughter because of that, he decides to get his life back on track again.<br/><br/>Directed by Antoine Fuqua, Southpaw is that same tale of redemption we have seen before so many times and the drama itself is pretty weak to hold everything together. Kurt Sutter's screenplay is filled with terrible dialogues that get annoying real quick and it's only after the turning set of events that the movie is able to find some sort of soberness in both its plot & characters.<br/><br/>The boxing bouts are able to grab the viewers' attention, camera-work is all over the place & not every attempted technique works out, especially that point-of-view shot in the matches. Editing could've trimmed down a lot more for its 121 minutes of runtime is excessive for the story it tries to tell. And last but not the least, James Horner's score doesn't really uplift the whole experience by any means.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, Southpaw features a fine cast in Jake Gyllenhaal, Rachel McAdams, Forest Whitaker, Naomie Harris, Oona Lawrence & 50 Cent, with only Gyllenhaal & Whitaker truly committed to their roles. Gyllenhaal gives his all when he is in the ring and carries the film on his own for the most part. Whitaker supports him nicely with an assured performance while the rest are more or less forgettable.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Southpaw tries to present itself as a gripping tale of redemption but it doesn't do anything different to separate its tale from the already existing crowd. Even the final fight this movie was building up throughout its runtime isn't as rewarding as expected but it nonetheless allows the story to conclude on a respectable note, if not a memorable one. A moderately entertaining flick, Southpaw fails to deliver the knockout punch."
"Jerghal","7","1","2","24 November 2015"," Also worth watching if you don't like boxing
","I watch a surprising amount of sports movies for a guy who doesn't give a flying monkey about sports in general. Okay maybe not that many but I do make exceptions in certain cases. The reason I saw this one is because Jake Gyllenhaal, one of the greatest actors of his generation chose to act in it. And believe you me, Gyllenhaal lives up to his excellent reputation again, you can actually blindly go see any movie with him in it and not be disappointed. One of the most important things in a movie is that you care what happens to the characters and by casting Rachel McAdams and Gyllenhaal you'll care a lot. Boxing movies for the rest mostly follow the same pattern (if you've seen a few you know what I mean) and this one is not that different from most other except that the centerpiece of the film is not the boxing match but what goes on in this boxers life. An excellent movie and worth a watch even if you don't like sports or boxing movies."
"charleswjoke","7","1","2","10 November 2015"," Raw to the bone
","Southpaw is a punch to the gut. The story is a pretty basic one, a boxer at his prime goes through some personal losses, and has to learn a new better way of fighting and thinking to claim his redemption. It's an efficient story but a sad one as it felt like Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) couldn't get a break until 2/3 of the movie was finished. The movie does not back down on Hope and this can get disheartening but makes the ending much more powerful. The performances were all very good with Gyllenhaal almost unrecognizable in his role. His track record as an actor is becoming better and better as he switches from different roles to another. Forrest Whitaker proves once again that he is a great secondary actor by playing a memorable flawed trainer. Most characters were interesting and three dimensional and I was looking forward to a flawed, guilt ridden portrayal of the ""villain"" who was indirectly involved in the event that crushed Billy Hope and started his descent from glory. Instead, the issue isn't addressed and we are left with a somewhat bland antagonist..."
"christian94","9","1","2","4 November 2015"," One of the Best of 2015 - Acting (and Directing)
","Antoine Fuqua, like Todd Field, knows how to get the best from his actors. He directed a Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role win for Denzel Washington and Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role nomination for Ethan Hawke with the landmark Training Day (2001). He directed Hawke again along with Richard Gere and Don Cheadle with the fine Brooklyn's Finest (2009) and now ""Southpaw"" may be his crown achievement even if slightly formulaic feel good tough boxing movie.<br/><br/>Now, he literally trains with and transforms Jake Gyllenhaal into the fictional boxer Billy Hope. Hope is a high profile boxer who has issues and when his life turns for the worse he is a sad human mess played to perfection by Gyllenhaal who's Oscar Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role nomination for Brokeback Mountain (2005) may be backed by a Leading Role nod for this which he barely missed for Nightcrawler (2014) with more deserving top notch tough competition but was nominated for Golden Globes.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker who played the Golden Globe Best Actor nominee dejected, drunk and talented Bird (1988) now plays the bruised but wise mentor and coach in ""Southpaw"". In this subtle supporting role, he hasn't been this good since his momentous Oscar win for The Last King of Scotland (2006). <br/><br/>Rachel McAdams is beyond believable as Hope's wife and may get her first supporting actress nom if the stars are aligned although her part may be overlooked for various reasons. Her acting performance is however crucial to the whole storyline and she pulls it off and then some.<br/><br/>Last but not least, Oona Laurence plays Hope's daughter with depth and takes control of powerful scenes. We haven't seen strong child acting like this for a long time - think Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense (1999) not Quvenzhane Wallis in Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012). Even better than 2015 worthy co-favourite film ""Room"" performance by Jacob Tremblay. Other current contenders for best of the year I have seen and agree with are Scott's ""The Martian"" and Villeneuve's ""Sicario"" sans Gyllenhaal. I haven't seen Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies"", Zemickis' ""The Walk"", Boyle's ""Steve Jobs,"" Crowley's ""Brooklyn"", or Haynes' ""Carol"", and I am anticipating ""The Revenant"" from one of my long time favourite directors like everyone else.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal who's work with Villeneuve in Enemy and Prisoners proved he is a formidable lead in 2013, garners much attention here and Fuqua and his film will make waves before his Magnificent Seven remake hits the theatres next year... with Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke.<br/><br/>This movie will have you feeling, thinking and cheering for the growth, not the glory.<br/><br/>Bon cinema!<br/><br/>PS: look out for Cheadle's directorial debut ""Miles Ahead"" as well."

SOUTHPAW was written by television series writer Kurt Sutter and directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Shooter, Equalizer, Olympus Has Fallen, etc). The reason the tired story and slow movie holds together is due to the splendid acting of Jake Gyllenhaal, Rachel McAdams, Forest Whitaker, Oona Laurence and Naomie Harris. Otherwise it is a predictable, slow moving, same old story rehashed.<br/><br/>The story? – 'As tragedy strikes him in his prime (his beloved wife Maureen – Rachel McAdams – is killed after he has won the title of boxing champion at Madison Square Garden), famed boxer, Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to fall into a great depression.

He isn't made out to be a hero like Rocky, he's a man seeped in flaws trying to be a father. Climbing back into the ring wasn't just to hold some belt, it was to provide a life for his daughter.

You feel his wife's fear and concern, his grief and pain, and his daughters heartbreak as she losses not only her mom but her dad as well. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an Oscar worthy performance, easily the best of his already impressive career.

","Antoine Fuqua takes the directorial positions in this smart and moving sports drama that originally started off as an anticipated sequel to Eminem's biopic 8 Mile, before ultimately changing into a powerful boxing drama with Jake Gyllenhaal sporting the lead role. Gyllenhaal plays Billy Hope, a bold middle-weight boxing champion with a beautiful, loving wife Maureen (played by Rachel McAdams) and an adorable daughter eight-year old daughter named Leila (played by Oona Laurence). Maureen wants him to retire as she becomes increasingly concerned with his well being as he suffers various cuts and bruises on his face and forbids their daughter from watching him during the matches. One night at a charity event when Billy Hope's family is hit with an unexpectedly tragedy, his life plunges into a downward spiral. To matters, he eventually loses custody of his daughter and is left alone with no one turn to but former fighter Tick Willis (played by Forest Whitaker). In an effort to gain his life back, Billy enlists Willis to train him for a fight against Mexican boxer Miguel Escobar (played by Miguel Gomez) which will soon become the biggest boxing match of his life.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal who gained a strong and super muscular build for his role blesses this movie with a powerhouse performance, even more impressive than his role in last year's Nightcrawler. Gyllenhaal just brings such immense energy and adrenaline in his character. His performance is a big stand out from the whole movie itself. Thanks to the brilliant script by Kurt Sutter, the movie presents a powerful and touching, but somewhat flawed story of the downfall of the main character's life when he loses one of his loved ones. The biggest disappointment comes not from the movie, but from the trailer gives a little too much away by revealing the tragic scene towards the beginning. Now there is no denying that the film is story does rely heavily on clichés from the other boxing films. However, the beautifully written screenplay may please audience enough to forgive the story's thin originality. This is also very emotionally charged, almost to where it feels manipulative. At the same time, you can't help but feel the powerful emotions for the main character not because the story tries to make you to, but because you want to. The characters are so well written that you care with them. <br/><br/>The boxing scenes are some of the most realistic fights I have seen put together in a movie. Every punch you watch thrown, you can just feel the adrenaline in the characters and the sweat drenching their bodies, especially in the climatic fight scene towards the end, and the atmosphere is intense to the point where you would left glued to your seats.<br/><br/>Southpaw is one of the best film of this year and I really hope it lands some Oscar nominations, particularly for Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. It is very smart, moving, and a must watch for not everyone, but mature viewers looking for a great movie."

"midas-jacobs","8","1","2","4 October 2015"," An amazingly well acted boxing film.
","There might be some spoilers in here. <br/><br/>Billy Hope was a good boxer, he was the best. But then there happens a tragedy. His wife gets shot. After this event everything goes downhill for him. He can't see his daughter anymore, he loses a lot of his money. After a while he decides that it has been enough, and starts to get back in the ring. To do this he has do be trained again. This time by Tick Willis.<br/><br/>The directing and cinematography were handled good. I found that a lot of scenes looked good, but sometimes the cinematographer chose some interesting angles and at times they didn't look that good. What I liked the most was that the director put the camera as the face of the boxer in the fighting scenes, how the camera took the hits or dodged them. This really brought you into the moment just like the slow motion. Due to this you felt more emotion in these scenes which I liked. The fight scenes in the boxing ring were nicely shot, with no shaky cam. But the directing, when Escobar provokes Billy and they start fighting, was a bit all over the place. You couldn't really see what was going on. The tension in the movie was very well. The beginning fighting scene was already tense, just like the last fighting scene. In the end of my review I am going to talk some more about this scene. The boxing is also very realistic. Overall I liked the first part of the movie the most, because there were more clichés in the second part of ""Southpow""<br/><br/>The acting of this movie is just mind-blowingly good. Espaccialy from Jake Gyllenhaal. He played Billy Hope, a top boxer who goes through some terrible moments in this movie, the death of his wife, not getting the chance of seeing his daughter. Due to this he also has some anger management issues. By Gyllenhaals performance you can really see how broken Billy is by all this. What I also liked about Gyllenhaal was how he transformed his body into the one of Billy Hope. Just some months after ""Nightcrawler"" Where he played a skinny man and now he is this muscular man. The movie also stars Rachel McAdams. She plays the wife of Billy. Even though she is in the movie for a small bit, she was also amazing. 50 cent plays the first manager of Billy, but he switches sides and becomes the manager of Escobar. By 50 Cent's performance I was surprised, because he was really good in ""Southpow"". But the one that surprised me the most is Oona Laurence, she played Leila Hope, the daughter of Billy. How she and Gyllenhaal played together was just nice to look at. Oona was very convincing and she deserves an Oscar nomination for her role. Forest Whitaker who played Tick Willis, the new trainer of Billy. He plays like I said the new trainer of billy, but due to the good acting you can see that he has also done his time. And with this I don't mean that he has been in prison, but that he is also a very damaged person. <br/><br/>The writing was not to bad, but it wasn't great either. There were a lot of clichés, like the training montage. But the training montage still had a nice song over it. The story was also kind of predictable. But the writing did do something good. It made you feel bad. When Mo (the wife of Billy) gets killed you immediately feel bad for Billy. And the movie has some other of these sad moments like when they take away his daughter. But for me personally the most sad moment is when his daughter gets mad at him and says that he should have been the one that was shot and not his wife. There is also some stupid dialogue at times, but overall the script was good. Now I am going to talk about the final fighting scene and the ending. The final fighting scene was very tense, but you could already see that Billy was going to win. If you were going to compare it with the fighting scene of ""Warrior"", you could say that the one from ""Warrior"" was way better, and this was because you kind of cared about the two characters and couldn't find out who was going to win. But the ending was very emotional and tear jerking. <br/><br/>Overall I think this is a fun movie, Even though there are some clichés. The acting was amazing and the directing was good. I would definitely recommend this movie if you are a fan of boxing movies."

","Southpaw isn't just a fighting movie, although the fights are really exciting and well done. it has so much in it, anyone who watches this can learn a thing or two. <br/><br/>Without giving too much details, Southpaw shows how a boxing champion trying to recover from a disaster. Even though the storyline consists some holes, in my opinion it is fascinating and not so predictable as other movies at this genre.<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie with trilling action scenes, some heartbreaking events, laughing periods and many lessons for life, go for it!<br/><br/>Loved 50 cent...<br/><br/>Eminem soundtracks are insanely good..."
"alix_hanson","5","1","2","22 September 2015"," Good acting BUT why is he white?
","Good acting by Gyllenhaal, but this movie just doesn't ring true. The way that his character is treated by the system when his daughter is taken away, the suspicion with which he is treated when he tries to visit his daughter, even the way he interacts with his wife and child before tragedy strikes.... ""baby this"", ""baby that"", ""baby, baby, baby"". The way the actor interacts with his homies. It just doesn't ring true at all that this character is cast as white. Gyllenhaal acted well, but there are plenty of black actors who would have given the story more realism. This story portrays a tale that is totally unrelatable to many white men (even from working class/care backgrounds), but would be VERY relatable to black boxers trying to make it (not necessarily the death of a wife, but the role in the sport, the way he can't even lose control in grief without losing his child, the mistrust from authorities and the way he is treated in court). <br/><br/>I read that the lead character was actually supposed to be played by Eminem, not Jake - and that explains a lot. They wanted a white/wanna-be type hero who has struggles LIKE that of a black man...without actually having to BE black."
"MattHanneman","5","1","2","21 September 2015"," an excuse for the director to train as a boxer
","There was a lot of hype around this movie, I had big expectations, perhaps that's why the movie was mediocre at best, the trailer already did something which is becoming more and more common place nowadays which is give away most of the story. We see a boxers wife get shot, daughter taken away. It's easy to guess this is going to motivate him to train again and end with a big fight. How is this for a boxing movie ending, don't end with a fight? <br/><br/>We never learn the details around his wife's murder, I thought it had something to do with 50 cents character whom not much attention was given to and probably should have been the main villain of the story, not the Colombian boxer. Small things like having a funeral scene right after the morning of murder seems as if they buried her the next day. The daughter doesn't seem to care much about her dead mother. We don't see her cry. <br/><br/>Maybe if he and his wife weren't orphans and were already rich from birth and then had to lose everything it could of made more sense or the character would of had a bigger ark or something. If not his wife at least he could have always been wealthy and such. Billy Hope's friend and crew don't get any exposition, why the beat up car if he's working for the World champ boxer. <br/><br/>Overall movie was a bit too hyped and the story fell short in depth and was just a simple boxing movie where a guy has it all, then loses it and has to learn what important to him and work hard to get it back. Typical, nothing special. Good acting and score however."
"WinterbornTM","6","1","2","8 September 2015"," Great Performances, Weak Story
","As far as sports movies go, Southpaw is not really up there with the first Rocky or Raging Bull, but it's not a total loss either. Some of the better elements of this movie are the performances, especially Jake Gyllenhaal's, who's on a winning streak in the most recent years (see Prisoners, Enemy or Nightcrawler).The side characters include Rachel McAdams as his wife, Forest Whitaker as the trainer, Oona Laurence as the daughter and 50 Cent as a fight manager. They all do a decent job, but the one who really shines out is Oona Laurence.<br/><br/>The directing style of Antoine Fuqua is beautiful, the fight scenes look amazing, some of the best boxing fights we had on the big screen. The way the camera is positioned, you really feel you're in the ring with the fighters and that adds an intensity to the scene.<br/><br/>That being said, the movie really falls short in the story section. The screenplay is filled with clichés and predictable elements that you meet in every boxing movie ever made. Also the at some points, the plot becomes overly dramatic, there isn't a single touch of humor to lighten some of the movie's scenes.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal then this movie is a decent watch, if not, go and re-watch the original Rocky. All in all, this movie gets a 6 out of 10."
"mickeyagrawal2001","5","1","2","4 September 2015"," Felt rushed and incomplete
","The whole getting back to boxing part looked so rushed and incomplete as if director got bored about the 'would be' best part of the movie..the acting was good but it looked so repeated type of thing and even that was not done right. Karate kid movies were better than this movie on drama aspect alone. The story did not flow at correct speed after the 'incident' and everything felt awkward and rushed. I wished there was something new, since the use of old concept brought a certain standard to it. The training scenes were much better in Never Back down which should have been the best part of such type of story. Really bad..5 marks from me and that to for acting alone that to of Jake alone. Such bad use of Rachel."

","Southpaw is the story of an obviously juiced up boxer with an incredible 43-0 record. After his wife is shot dead he loses every single possession, including his daughter within 8 weeks. He ends up sweeping the floor at a boxing gym and about 6 months later fights the man responsible for his wife's death for the world title. He displays no animosity towards him even touching gloves in a sign of sportsmanship at the start of the fight. He wins the fight by split decision and the world title. It was a good win especially considering he only had a 6 week training camp but was still more ripped than any pro boxer I have ever seen.<br/><br/>His trainer had a glass eye, was an alcoholic but taught this ex world champ to jab and block punches .

","Southpaw is a great film about Billy Hope (Gyllenhaal) a boxer who lost his wife and it affected his in ring performance costing him dearly.<br/><br/>This film is amazing from the directing to the soundtrack. I believe that Forest Whitaker gave an incredible performance and Gyllenhaal was perfect, maybe the best of his career, I wouldn't be shocked if Gyllenhaal earned his second Academy Award nomination with this performance. What was really interesting was how director Antoine Fuqua managed to make this film not only emotional and tugging on the audience's heartstrings but was jam- packed with action. The thing I enjoyed the most about this film was how aggressive it was, reinforcing the aggression involved in preparing for a boxing match. This is emphasised with Billy Hope having anger issues and Gyllenhaal excellently portrayed the struggles with being short tempered in today's society.<br/><br/>Despite this in my opinion the film unsuccessfully showed me how Billy Hope was raised in the 'ghetto'. He wasn't very fortunate in his upbringing but it didn't make me sympathise with him even more than I did. <br/><br/>Fantastic film and I would recommend it to everyone old enough to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Grade - A+"
"jasontheterrible","1","2","8","9 August 2018"," This film is about Antoine Fuqua
","Fuqua gives us the new stereo-type white male. He is weak, addicted to drugs, and talks like a black person. He can only be restored to strength by strong black males who have far superior survival skills and values. <br/><br/>Gyllenhaal is such a great actor but even he cannot act out becoming a black man. Nothing rings true. Fuqua, like many far-left zealots, revel in the decline in white males and want them to be as pictured here. Many have become this stereo-type, which is why it exists, and while so many white males actually enjoyed this, and gave it a high rating. The negative reviews were a more precise description and obviously came from those still opposing this crest. They refuse to wear it and extol its virtues despite the reality it represents."
"Leofwine_draca","4","1","3","6 March 2018"," Same old
","SOUTHPAW is another same old-same old boxing drama about a boxing champion going through personal tragedy, losing it all, and then having to train to get back to the top again. You've seen this kind of gritty tale play out loads of times before in the likes of RAGING BULL and the ROCKY franchise, and I found this was a rather inferior version of the story: full of cliches and bad language, but with little wit or heart. A near-unrecognisable Jake Gyllenhaal plays the unsympathetic lead and doesn't really do much with it, although he's in good physical shape. Rachel McAdams is my favourite part of the film and appears in a crucial role early on. Forest Whitaker shows up late on as a trainer but only gets to go through the motions which is a pity. The running time is overlong and the character drama is a bit overwrought, with a lot of flaws throughout preventing it from really zinging; the actress playing Gyllenhaal's daughter is another misstep as she's totally cold. Antoine Fuqua has directed other films very well but he's merely middling here and the boxing scenes lack dynamism."

"j-madej","7","1","3","5 August 2015"," You might feel that ""Southpaw"" is full of clichés and been there done that mind frame and to be quite honest you would be right.
","I will state it upfront that I will be extra hard in my review of ""Southpaw"" the new boxing movie directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, The Equalizer, Olympus Has Fallen), let me explain why. I am a student of the ""Sweet Science"" as boxing is called in pugilist circles, for over 19 years now. I am a hardcore fan of boxing and follow what is happening in this sport everyday visiting boxing websites. I watch every major boxing fight of the last 20 years and thousands of mediocre ones as well. You name a fighter in the past two decades and I probably saw him fighting, know his record and I will be able to name five top opponents he faced in his career. I witnessed career of Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, Oscar De La Hoya, and other top pound for pound fighters with almost religious devotion. I am also a student of the history of boxing going all the way back to boxers like Jack Jonson, Joe Lewis and Rocky Marciano. Apart of being a fan I also train boxing. In my home I had a punch bag and speed bag and when I go to the gym I always start with boxing workout consisting of shadow boxing, and sessions on Heavy and Soft bags. I am aware of boxing techniques, leg movement and defensive techniques. Bottom line boxing is a sport I have been obsessed with for the last two decades. This is why I am always extra excited and hard when I hear about a new boxing movie which will be released to the mainstream. Whenever you have such devotion to one sport it is almost sacrilegious feeling when boxing is not depicted in correct or believable way. This brings us to the new installment in boxing movies tradition which saw many wonderful attempts to show the reality of the sport as well many failures. ""Southpaw"" falls somewhere between this category. Billy ""The Great"" Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal), the reigning junior middleweight boxing champion, has an impressive career, a loving wife and daughter, and a lavish lifestyle. However, when tragedy strikes, Billy hits rock bottom, losing his family, his house and his manager. He soon finds an unlikely savior in Tick Willis (Forest Whitaker), a former fighter who trains the city's toughest amateur boxers. With his future on the line, Hope fights to reclaim the trust of those he loves the most. I must say when you read this premiss you might feel that it is full of clichés and been there done that mind frame and to be quite honest you would be right. This type of redemption stories has been done before and to better effect. There is nothing overly unique about it. With lesser director this film would be just another corny Rocky wanna be but by adding Jake Gyllenhaal and his acting craft, this potentially mediocre film raised beyond the level it was heading to. Originally ""Southpaw"" was supposed to be a follow up to Eminem's 8 Mile with Slim Shady resuming the titled role. Thankfully he decided to focus on the music department of the movie and left acting to the professional and let me tell you Jake did fine job portraying a boxer. Specially the out of the ring aspect. His physique is ripped and many months he spent in Wild Card Gym of Hall of Fame trainer Freddie Roach, one of the best in the world, paid off. Watching fighters like Manny Pacquiao and Miguel Cotto made a difference in the way he prepared for this role. Usually when it comes to boxing movies the biggest problem actors have is with footwork. It is where boxers generate power from. Without good footwork you can not box effectively and it takes a long time before moving around the ring becomes second nature. Jakes footwork was decent which allowed him to build up on the rest of the boxing technique. The actual fights might not be as well choreographed or shot as in lets say ""Raging Bull"" masterpiece of Martin Scorsese arguably the best boxing movie ever made. To elaborate on outside boxing issues the story feels very predictable you can almost guess how the movie will end half way through. The other notable performances are led by Forest Whitaker as the washed up trainer though his performance might be largely overlooked because it feels inconsistent. I could dissect the rest of the cast but let me summarize this in one sentence. This film without Jake and good director would be mediocre. Even the title sounds like a gimmick. The title of the film is a reference to the eponymous stance traditionally adopted by a left handed boxer. As previous Rocky movies Jakes character learns as an orthodox fighter to switch to lefty to surprise his big nemesis. This is only one of the clichés I am talking about. If you are not a boxing fan I do think you might be swept by the drama of the story and you will root for the underdog but if you have understanding of the fight game you will be fidgeting uncomfortably and will have half backed smirk on your face and it won't be because you think what you are seeing on the screen is realistic depiction of Sweet Science. ""Southpaw"" isn't a bad film by any means but it is not a new Rocky, where with Stallone you could feel that he was a student of the game, this film feels like a dramatization of events which we've seen over and over in the past."
"nivori","8","1","3","8 August 2015"," Watched the movie yesterday, can't forget it
","While other sport movies are out there, I don't actually remember their plot, the thing special about Southpaw though, is the feelings you go through when you watch it. It has some moments of cliché, but I can forgive it, because there are more moments when you feel as the characters feel. There even were moments when I had goose bumps, so that means something about the movie.<br/><br/>Pros: - Good actors.<br/><br/><ul><li>Feelings involved.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Good fight shots.</li></ul><br/><br/>Cons: - A bit predictable.<br/><br/><ul><li>Clichéd.</li></ul><br/><br/>This movie may satisfy some, while it can dissatisfy others (one of my friends didn't like it, while the others did).

"oscaralbert","8","1","3","7 August 2015"," Some viewers may see SOUTHPAW as just another fight flick but . . .
",". . . it's more than a ROCKY remake. Jake Gyllenhaal's pugilist character, Billy Hope, begins the story as a Super-Rich World Champ. As implausible as this may seem give Billy's pale demographic, this is the key to the allegorical structure of SOUTHPAW. Billy is meant by the filmmakers to represent America's Golden One Per Centers, who are overwhelmingly White despite a handful of Oprahs, Tigers, and LeBrons. Billy's daughter, Leila, stands in for the rest of us--the 99% of Ordinary People Americans. Billy Hope losing his first fight, his wife, his career, his support team, his home, and custody of his daughter echoes the U.S. financial crash of 2008. In order to win his daughter back (along with a few incidentals), Yesterday's One Per Center Fat Cat Billy must spend a big chunk of his life cleaning the toilets of us normal people, which is exactly what SOUTHPAW's producers (The Weinstein Company) want Donald Trump to do BEFORE he asks for our votes. Let's see if The Donald can follow in Billy's footsteps, scrubbing out the Thrones dearest to the Hearts of America during 16-hour days for the next 15 months! Billy comes out of this tale with custody of his kid, and a room at the Y (or some such place). That's how the Trump-type folks can best weather the Coming Storm, SOUTHPAW suggests."

","After watching the previews and trailers I decided to go watch this film, and I am very glad that I did. I think the screen play and acting was outstanding. The film is about a former championship fighter who is off his game and kind reaching a low point. He is doing his best to slowly climb his way back into the ring. In my opinion what this is where I think some of the negativity comes from - this film is not only about boxing. But its more about the emotional journey that he must undertake in order to find his form again. Its also about his role as a Father and love for his Daughter. As I said an excellent cast who all deliver outstanding performances. 50 Cent aka Curtis Jackson pleasantly surprised me. Jake Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker both delivered performances that really should get them Oscars! Fantastic Cinematography, and my god them fight scenes you really get sucked in and believe your truly ring side!<br/><br/>You really need to go watch this film its one not to be missed."

","Southpaw drinking game, take a shot every time you hear Jake Gyllenhaal say 'Baby'.. seriously try it, he says that more than Vin Diesel says the word family.<br/><br/>Southpaw follows Billy 'The Great' Hope, another powerhouse performance from Jake Gyllenhaal. He has been on a role recently, especially with his role in Nightcrawler, and his performance in this film certainly doesn't disappoint. Hope is a boxer who is at the top of his game, he is the reigning Light Heavyweight champion and seems like an unstoppable force. After a fight breaks out between him and a rival boxer, Hope's wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) is shot and killed. What follows is a downward spiral in his life including the loss of his wealth, his manager and even his daughter. An ex boxer played by Forrest Whittaker seems like his only hope at getting back in the ring and gaining his life back. Now, the plot is very simple and it is something we have seen before, the whole cast however, especially Gyllenhaal and Whittaker draw us straight in. Southpaw has a VERY slow start. Don't go to this film expecting a straight up boxing film because that isn't what you will get. When we get to see the boxing action it is great, especially the intense last fight, but Southpaw is more a film about loss and redemption.<br/><br/>If that sounds good chances are you will find a lot to like about this film. Gyllenhaal manages to be likable even at the times you don't feel like you should like him, heck even 50 Cent as the Don King-like douchebag manager who only cares about himself manages to have a likability about him which is hard to pull off. Feels kind of horrible to say this is a film.i enjoyed because its almost like me saying i enjoyed seeing a man lose everything.. but in fact what i enjoyed more was his path to redemption and seeing him gain it all back over time because Hope can be a relatable character. You see that he has become the man he was before and is capable of looking after his daughter afterall and seeing how he interacted with Rachel McAdams before the film kicked off helped us see this. In the end, the boxing was great, the cast was stellar. As much as Jake Gyllenhaal deserves an Oscar nomination, if he didn't get one for Nightcrawler he wont get one here. Not a perfect film and at times its hard to get in to, but well worth the watch.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"aharmas","10","1","3","31 July 2015"," What a Comeback!!!
","Gyllenhall is a reliable performer. We can count on him giving his best. This means both the emotional and physical make up of his characters. This is what makes a film like ""Nightcrawler"" rise beyond its simple premise. He shone in several films before, but his turn in ""Southpaw"" has set up new marks, even for him.<br/><br/>The film follows a powerful boxing world champion who continues undefeated. His main source of support is his tough and beautiful wife, played convincingly by McAdams. He survives and succeeds as long as she's around because she's his emotional source of support, as well as a great manager who knows and understands his mercurial nature.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a tragic turn of events leaves him widowed, and because of his temper he neglects himself and exposes his daughter to drugs and violence. This will place new demands on him. The question remains whether he will be able to conquer those challenges and regain control of his personal and professional career.<br/><br/>""Southpaw"" introduces us to a tortured man whose life has been shaped by the worst of circumstances, who rises to the top, loses his ways, and finds new opportunities to fly again. Forrest Whitaker comes him to provide him with training and insight. He's a steady source of support; however, he has his own problems, and these might affect his dedication because both men are driven and sometimes unable to look around for circumstances that might affect the achievement of their goals.<br/><br/>Let it be said that most people in the audience will be pleased by the way the film unfolds as we see some exciting boxing pieces, realistic rather than stylized. Every punch is felt, every potential knock out takes our breath, and watching the winner take the prize is indeed an exhilarating experience. Add to that, strong emotional lines, and another great performance by Jake, and we have a fantastic film."
"hannahgriffin","9","1","3","30 July 2015"," Best movie I've seen in a while
","Southpaw went above and beyond my expectations. While I saw the trailer months ago & was instantly hooked, I wasn't prepared for this movie to be so great. First of all, I know nothing about boxing. I've never even watched any type of boxing on TV or anything. Any movie that can capture your attention so well, even when it's about something you were never previously interested in, automatically earns points. But this movie was about so much more than boxing.<br/><br/>I probably teared up at least once in every scene of this movie. Gyllenhaal's performance was absolutely stunning. His raw emotion felt so real, and the way his character changes throughout the film is done perfectly. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets nominated for an Oscar. <br/><br/>Even if you aren't an ""action fan"" this film is for ANYONE who loves a damn good story. I would recommend this to anyone who's old enough to watch it. I haven't seen a movie this good since Oscar season."
"stankactorman","9","1","3","30 July 2015"," Fighter finds redemption
","SOUTHPAW: There's a finite number of formulas for any boxing movie and no matter what anyone does, there will always be comparisons to Raging Bull and Rocky. There's our hero's fame, fortune and lavish life style, the folks who remain loyal as long as he's on top, there are those who screw him over, there's the family, the entourage, the inevitable fall and loss of everything, redemption, the hateful, hot-shot challenger, the grudge/revenge match put together by the unscrupulous promoter, the obligatory training montage culminating in the big fight. There's even an aspect of 'Million Dollar Baby' at work here. But what separates Southpaw from just another boxing move, is the brilliant direction by Antoine Fuqua. Every frame is precise. The camera placement, the angles, the moves, the meticulous, selective use of close ups, the fight sequences which are brutal and gut wrenching, which put the audience in the ring, hit every emotional beat which in turn allows the cast to deliver brilliant, nuanced performances across the board. Could get a Best Picture and Best Director Oscar nom. I also predict Oscar noms for Jake Gyllenhaal, who transformed himself physically and turns in a performance unlike anything I've seen him do before, and for Forest Whitaker, with the barest trace of the tics we've seen him do previously. Their scenes together are why we go to the movies. I also predict an Oscar nom for Oona Lawrence, the 11-12 year old, as the daughter, who comes through with a powerful performance with depth far beyond her years. This kid is freakin' awesome. Rachael McAdams, as the loving and supportive wife, is breath taking, but I'm afraid she isn't around long enough for award recognition. My only complaint was the slurred speech Gyllenhaal gave to his punchy character which made him a little hard to understand at times. Score: 9. GO! It's a knockout of a movie. <br/><br/>(And just when you thought the Rocky franchise was done, lo and behold, there was a trailer for the next installment, 'CREED' about Apollo's son who's a fighter trained by Balboa. Promoting a boxing movie before a boxing movie: ingenious or overkill? Discuss.)"
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","3","30 July 2015"," Formulaic but worth watching for Gyllenhaal's performance
","I have no interest in boxing, which I think is a brutal sport, but I really admire Jake Gyllenhaal as an actor so I was willing to see this movie in which he takes the eponymous role. In ""Nightcrawler"", Gyllenhaal was amazing, both for his lean appearance and brilliant portrayal of a man determined to better himself at any cost. This time, he has beefed up his body in another total transformation that took five months and gives another very impressive performance as Billy Hope, a boxer who goes from the heights to the depths and back again.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams as Billy's wife and Forrest Whitaker as his trainer give strong supporting turns, while as his young daughter Oona Lawrence is surprisingly convincing for her age. Director Antoine Fuqua provides some opening and closing fight scenes that are genuinely hard-hitting. But there is nothing new or surprising here; it is totally predictable and formulaic and old-fashioned. It is Gyllenhaal that makes it a movie worth watching."

","Boxing is a barbaric sport that simply makes the possibility of obtaining life-threatening and/or debilitating injuries to someone's life at a young age more prevalent, but yet, it's one of the most popular international sports. Boxing is so popular because of the fact that it's simple and fulfills animalistic aggression inside its spectators and its participators. It takes the frustration and anger emotions and exemplifies them through the universally understood action of punching and beating the everloving hell out of somebody. It fills an audience with excitement and adrenaline, as it does its the actual pugilists, but the common-ground achieved between the audience and the fighters is in the gratification. Through every punch, a strong human chord is struck in everyone who witnesses it and some reaction, internal or external, is prompted.<br/><br/>Fighting seems to be embedded in New York City boxer Billy Hope's (Jake Gyllenhaal) life. Raised in foster care throughout much of his young life and making a name for himself thanks to his ability to throw a crushing, Earth-shattering blow to his opponents, Billy has had to fight for something his entire life, be it a meal, a family, or the next belt in the ranks. Right by his side throughout the entire time of his fighting career are his loving wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) and their young daughter Leila (Oona Laurence). After his most recent fight sees him stumble and hesitate a bit more than normal, Maureen tells Billy that he should consider hanging up his gloves for a while, despite intense pressure by his manager (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) to ink a deal with HBO.<br/><br/>During a ceremony where Billy is set to announce his future plans, an altercation between Billy and rival boxer Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez) occurs in the lobby. This simple scuffle results in an all-out brawl, which leaves Maureen shot and killed by Miguel's brother Hector. Billy is beyond distraught; his voice of reason, true love, and his tender touch after all the brutal blows has been robbed from him in the blink of an eye. Billy begins to fall prey to crippling grief, alcoholism, and drug dependency, with the coffin-sealing nail being a disastrous fight that results in him headbutting a referee.<br/><br/>When Billy is scraping the bottom of the barrel, constantly in a sorrowful state in addition to being physically and emotionally exhausted following Leila's placement in foster care, he looks towards Titus Wills (Forest Whitaker), a boxing trainer at a local-area gym, for assistance. Titus's mannered, methodical steps are what Billy needs to try and not only revitalize his career but rebuild his life anew.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua's ""Southpaw"" is a brutal picture; similar to ""American Sniper"" last year, anyone who isn't used to seeing dramas with a plethora of heartwrenching events an excessive brutality may find themselves really amazed and even startled to see how far this picture goes in painting crippling depression and grief. At the center of all the sadness is Gyllenhaal, who has proved to be one of the most awe-inspiring leading men Hollywood has to offer. Following numerous strong, creepy performances in films like ""Prisoners"" and ""Nightcrawler,"" ""Southpaw"" adds to Gyllenhaal's increasingly polished filmography in terms of showcasing rich, often frightening performances.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal's ability to be completely believable whilst cycling through numerous emotions proves him to be an actor with many impeccable talents. Consider his calculated movements in ""Nightcrawler,"" where he held blank stares for much of the film, beared a thin figure, and forced himself not to blink very frequently. Now consider ""Southpaw,"" a film where he has to go from one emotion to the next, often within the same scenes, throughout the film's entirety. Certain scenes, particularly with his character's daughter, start with Gyllenhaal holding a drowsy, dazed demeanor and escalate into groveling and crying within two or three minutes.<br/><br/>""Southpaw"" is almost guaranteed to take the viewer on an emotion roller-coaster, again, especially those not well-acquainted with this territory. For the most part, the film doesn't manipulate audience's emotions, but every now and then, we get the predictable attack lines from Leila to Billy, where the subsequent scenes are set to orchestration. These scenes are clearly meant to prompt reaction and do so in a manner that's less than subtle.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting that ""Southpaw"" is greatly levied by capable supporting performances by, not only Whitaker, but 50 Cent as well, who is all but guaranteed to get shafted due to his limited scenes in the film. His cut-throat, business-minded character that places personal value on Billy depending on his present monetary value and relevance throughout the film makes for a soul who is consistently interesting on screen, predominately because of how real this character not only feels, but is. This melting pot of varying actors and characters, in turn, makes ""Southpaw""'s occasional bouts of sentimentality and narrative predictabilities less apparent than if the acting was subpar.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this is the kind of picture that is destined to please the crowd, similar to ""American Sniper"" and ""The Judge,"" where even the more negative reviews will fail to keep the populous from enjoying a simple, well-told story about a very human character. Even for a mainstream film, however, ""Southpaw"" is a gritty and brutal picture, with well-choreographed action and blows that punctuate an immersive story for those who want the full admission price to feel worth it."
"ThomasDrufke","8","1","3","26 July 2015"," Gut-Punching
","This may be a controversial statement, but I don't know that anyone besides perhaps Daniel Day-Lewis commits to his roles more than Jake Gyllenhaal does. Year after year, and Oscar caliber performance after Oscar caliber performance, this man surprises me. Not only is Gyllenhaal incredibly dedicated, but he disappears into his roles, and as a famous A-list actor, that's pretty difficult to do. Southpaw is a good movie, but Gyllenhaal is phenomenal. It almost seemed like he was acting in a classic, but the film itself was just another solid sports picture. Don't get me wrong, this film has plenty of great performances, but sometimes everything doesn't quite come together. But considering just how good Gyllenhaal is, that's alright.<br/><br/>Southpaw tells the story of Billy Hope, an undefeated boxing champion who suffers a life shattering tragedy and is forced to rekindle his relationship with his daughter and reform his career following this event. If you haven't watched any of the trailers, don't. There's a huge spoiler/plot point that they show and it's entirely unnecessary. But even though I had seen both the trailers, I found the film to be just as captivating. Rachel McAdams doesn't have a huge role, but she's very effective as Hope's wife and backbone to everything he does. She's been good in True Detective this year, but I don't think she has ever been better than she was in her few scenes in Southpaw. It doesn't hurt that Gyllenhaal plays wells off of her and so does the daughter, played by Oona Laurence, for that matter. The entire family dynamic was really well handled and probably my favorite part about the movie. In fact, this isn't as much of a boxing film as it is a father-daughter story. Sure, it has a certain amount of a redemption involved in Hope's strive to get back in the ring, but I found his willingness to save his relationship with his daughter to be the much more appealing side of the film.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting how good Forest Whitaker is here as well. I think this film has about 20 tear jerking scenes but probably the best acted scenes involved him and Gyllenhaal. Both of them can do so much with just their facial expressions and particularly their eyes. There are few people in the business who can say entire paragraphs just by moving their eyes or face in a particular way. With all this being said, I think there are a few flaws with the film. There are several plot points that are brought up but then never addressed or resolved before the movie ends. I cant say much else without spoiling the film but I just thought the directing could have been more polished. There's also the lack of build up for the final fight. We spent a good chunk of the film dealing with family issues and Billy's inner demons, but then all of a sudden he's already prepared for a title fight. There were training sequences, sure, but the ending felt pretty rushed. Other than that, there isn't much to complain about with Southpaw. It's one of the best acted films so far this year, and of Jake Gyllenhaal's illustrious career. The directing could have been cleaned up but there's no denying how well the emotional gravitas of this film was handled. It's one of the better sports films of the last few years.<br/><br/>+Gyllenhaal does it again <br/><br/>+Music/soundtrack <br/><br/>+McAdams' pivotal performance <br/><br/>+Really, really, emotional <br/><br/>-Ending felt rushed <br/><br/>-Choppy directing <br/><br/>8.2/10"
"Challenger2013","8","1","3","26 July 2015"," Conventional, but Very Entertaining
","When this film was originally announced, rapper Eminem was attached to the lead role. After his excellent turn in ""8 Mile,"" I was excited to see how he would take on a film scripted by Kurt Sutter of ""Sons of Anarchy"" fame. I admit that I was quite disappointed when Eminem dropped out and was replaced by Jake Gyllenhaal. Now, I'm eating my words.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Gyllenhaal is excellent. His gritty, tough performance drives the picture and makes it better than it would otherwise be. July may be too early for awards talk, but hopefully the Academy keeps an eye on him for nomination time. He is easily deserving of the nod, especially after being snubbed for his brilliant turn in ""Nightcrawler."" His transformation between the two films is unbelievable, and the work it took should be noted and rewarded.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal plays Billy Hope, a boxer who is undefeated in the ring and loves to take hits. His life is great until his wife is tragically killed at a charity event. Billy instantly succumbs to alcohol, goes into depression, and loses his house, his money, and custody of his 10-year- old daughter. With everything he loves gone, he turns to a new trainer, played convincingly by Forrest Whitaker, to train him to get back in the ring and win his daughter back.<br/><br/>The film has a nice, tight script when it comes to dialogue, but often misses the mark in terms of plot. It doesn't fail when it comes to emotional story lines, but it follows the conventional code, specifically the formulas seen in ""Rocky"" and ""Rocky III."" There are simply too many similarities to be found between these films, which causes the mind to wonder whether Sutter is as creative as we thought. Sutter's grit is definitely felt, but not his wit. <br/><br/>There isn't much to complain about when it comes to Antoine Fuqua's direction, other than that his common over-reliance on violence is felt and he throws in some very unneeded and distracting point-of-view shots during the final fight. Otherwise, the film looks really good, and the dark lighting fits perfectly. The fight scenes are slightly over-the-top, but damn fun to watch. I found myself not wanting the last fight to end and thinking, ""this is what boxing should be like.""<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, the truth is that this is a good, emotional, gritty boxing film. It strikes a chord and nearly accomplishes what it would like to, especially during the deeply touching and emotional scenes between Hope and his daughter, played very well by Oona Laurence. With a stellar cast that moves the film along, ""Southpaw"" does enough to bring some cheers by the gripping final fight. The disappointment largely comes from the feeling that the film has the potential to be great, if not Oscar-worthy, but is unable to get there by being held back by conventional boxing film tropes."
"stevendbeard","7","1","3","24 July 2015"," Boxing Movie With A Good Story
","I saw ""Southpaw"", starring Jake Gyllenhaal-End of Watch, Brokeback Mountain; Rachel McAdams-About Time, the Sherlock Holmes movies; Forest Whitaker-Taken 3, Criminal Minds_tv and Curtis Jackson-Power_tv, Last Vegas, and Oh yeah, he goes by another name, too; 50 Cent.<br/><br/>This is a boxing movie with a good story. It was originally supposed to star rapper Eminem but he backed out, saying that he wanted to concentrate more on his music. He does contribute some songs to the soundtrack. This is also the last movie that music composer James Horner scored before he died in a plane crash on June 22, 2015. It's directed by Antoine Fuqua, who also handled The Equalizer, Olympus Has Fallen and Training Day-FYI: Right now he is working on a remake of The Magnificent Seven. The title of the movie, Southpaw, refers to someone that is left-handed, in this case, a left- handed boxer. Jake plays the aforementioned lefty that is the light weight champion-his record is 43/0-and he has everything you could imagine. A beautiful wife, Rachel, daughter, big mansion, fine cars, etc. Then, a tragedy takes it all away from him and he ends up having to try to rebuild his shattered life. Curtis, his manager, even leaves him-why stay when he isn't making him any money. Jake ends up with Forest, a former boxer turned trainer that runs a gym. Jakes' boxing style used to be that he would take a lot of punishment-he got hit a lot-but then he would focus his anger and then win the match. This was not making Rachel a very happy camper, as can be expected, so Forest then has his job cut out for him; to make Jake a better boxer. It's rated ""R"" for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes. I thought it was a good boxing movie and I would buy it on DVD."

All this year i had been waiting for a movie that bring me all what i expected for the amazing trailer and even more, with not only a cinematography perfectly use for a boxing- drama movie, a score that makes rest finally in peace James Horner and performances that made us cried, made one of the most insensitive persons of the whole Earth, my dad, and, us I did, said to me:""Wow, when are the next Osars?"". The director Antoine Fuqua made a perfect and clean film as we expected with the director of Training Day and The Equalizer.

And finally, if I can even say more, I had hearted for the last week, that this is the new Rocky, and I'm totally disagree, this movie just need only 123 minutes for being better than 6 Rocky movies, and I don't expect a sequel, and that is the greatest prove that this is a magnificent movie, that it's so good, that it doesn't need a sequel, that's it, end of discussion.

Ring side scenes are awesome, so is the court room scene as a distraught father. <br/><br/>If Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa set the benchmark for a Boxing Fighter flicks, undoubtedly Jake Gyllenhaal as Billy Hope surpassed it. I only hope he doesn't get typecast with this role and gets only Fighter Flicks in the future. He his versatile and hope he sticks to doing different roles.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams in her brief appearance as Maureen Hope has done her bit much, much better than Talia Shire as Adrian in Rocky. I'll still rate her 'The Vow' as the number one performance yet. Antoine Fuqua could've given her little more reel time, this movie does have a potential for a Southpaw II, how could you include Rachel in there? that's for Todd Black to figure out.<br/><br/>That said Antoine Fuqua has done a fabulous job, Kurt Sutter could've gone easy on the Melodrama and made the audience less ...what is the word?

"Anurag-Shetty","10","1","4","1 August 2015"," A flawless film, heightened by the performance of Jake Gyllenhaal.
","Southpaw tells the story of professional boxer, Billy Hope(Jake Gyllenhaal). Billy is an excellent boxer. He never gives up in the ring, no matter how many times he gets punched by his various opponents. Billy has a loving wife named Maureen Hope(Rachel McAdams), who gives him constant support during his boxing matches & life in general. Billy & Maureen have an adorable daughter named Leila Hope(Oona Lawrence). After Maureen loses her life in a tragic accident, Billy is devastated. Due to his increasingly dangerous behavior, child protection services decide to keep his daughter Leila in their custody until, Billy proves that he is a worthy parent in a court of law. Now, it is up to Billy with the help of new trainer, Tick Wills(Forest Whitaker) to get his personal & professional life back in order. <br/><br/>Southpaw is a mind blowing film! The story of the movie may be simple but, it is so extraordinarily executed that it doesn't matter. This film is a heartwarming tale of family & never giving up no matter what the odds are, with boxing providing the backdrop. The boxing matches are thrilling to watch. The first person camera angles make you feel like you are part of the action. Though this movie is brilliant, it is not for the faint of heart. There are many heartbreaking scenes & the boxing scenes are quite gory. The tear-jerking scenes are one of the highlights of the film. Incredible performances by the main cast is what pushes this movie to greatness. Jake Gyllenhaal gives us another spectacular performance as Billy Hope. Gyllenhaal's ability to adapt to any role be it the emotionally closed detective in Prisoners(2013), the rake thin, morally ambiguous reporter in Nightcrawler(2014) & now as the super beefy, physically & emotionally wrecked boxer in this movie, proves that Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the finest actors of his generation. You can see that Gyllenhaal has worked really hard to bulk up & train to portray a professional boxer. Rachel McAdams is superb as Maureen Hope. I just wanted McAdams to have more screen time. Forest Whitaker is great as Tick Wills. Oona Lawrence is outstanding as Leila Hope. Lawrence has a bright future ahead of her if she can act so brilliantly at such a young age. The bond shared between Gyllenhaal's Billy & Lawrence's Leila is another highlight of the movie. Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson is effective as Jordan Mains. Skylan Brooks is impressive as Hoppy. Naomie Harris is wonderful as Angela Rivera. Miguel Gomez is good as Miguel 'Magic' Escobar. Go watch Southpaw, immediately!"

","Southpaw is a straight forward movie - we have a protagonist who falls down just to get back up and rise all the way to the top. But is it all southpaw has to offer? Not even by a long shot. Southpaw is a movie about redemption, love, family, passion, anger, revenge, friendship and boxing, in that order. I cried with Billy (Jake), I laughed with him, I bled with him and I picked myself up with him. Southpaw is not just a movie about Billy, its a journey you will experience alongside him; an experience that will stay with you long after you have left the theater. Every single person associated with this project was awesome. All the actors, scriptwriters, costume and prop people, camera crew, the director; everyone has done a tremendous job. A must watch for fans of all movie genre alike."

"keithlovesmovies","7","1","4","27 July 2015"," Southpaw Review
","Billy ""The Great"" Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the current light middleweight boxing champion and he is on top of the world. He has an impressive, undefeated career, a loving wife and daughter, and an expensive lifestyle. He then goes on a downward spiral when his reign is challenged by a young, up-and-coming boxer Miguel 'Magic' Escobar (Miguel Gomez). Billy soon hits rock bottom following the loss of his life and family, losing his manager Jordan Mains (Curtis 50 Cent Jackson), and financial problems occur causing him to lose his house. In his search for redemption, he finds Tick Willis (Forest Whitaker), a trainer who trains amateur boxers and also a former boxer. Hope is trying to change his former ways and resurrect his career in order to prove himself to his daughter and the world.<br/><br/>I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying that this is a redemption story (I kind of did above). In this case, it is more of the paint-by-numbers variety. It just goes through the checklist one item at a time. But you quickly forget all of this when the film puts you through an emotional roller coaster. It does a good job at making you feel what the characters are feeling, from their highs to their lows. What helps this is the performances of Gyllenhaal's Billy and Rachel McAdams who plays his wife Maureen. The chemistry the two have are strong which elevates their emotional scenes. Gyllenhaal's transformation is remarkable, bulking up and adding layers of weight and muscle to his own frame and this degree of commitment to his roles is something that no too many actors have. This is commendable but where he excels is how he portrays Billy's inner demons and how he goes from being full of rage and is able to control his rage and use it productively as motivation to fix himself for the people he loves. Whitaker is also strong here providing a solid performance portraying a multi-dimensional character with some darkness to him but also as someone who cares and very sympathetic. Did I mention this film was predictable? I expected this coming in but I still somewhat enjoyed the journey. I would have appreciated a little more originality when it came to the story as it is riddled with clichÃ©s and nuanced characters such as his wife (McAdams' Maureen), his manager (50 Cent's Jordan) and his daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) who occasionally came off as a little annoying. I would like to take this moment to commend the film's cinematography and score. The boxing sequences were well done in that the camera shots made you feel like you were part of the action. The score really helped in elevating the dramatic sequences in the film. Despite being a little formulaic, the film is saved by the performances of the two leads and by the direction and production values.<br/><br/>keithlovesmovies.com"

","""Southpaw"" is new in theaters this weekend, and for the film Jake Gylenhaall transformed his body to accurately resemble a light heavyweight boxing champ. His acting chops have brought him acclaim in recent years, and he once again scores a knockout. <br/><br/>Based as a metaphor on the rise, fall and resurrection of rapper Eminem's career, we see Jake's boxer endure a family tragedy and have to rebuild his life and boxing stardom from scratch. The movie starts (unlike most boxing movies) at the top of Billy Hope's career. When his wife is shot and killed.Billy's world doesn't just collapses, it implodes, as in no longer exists, when he's provoked into a fight by a rival and his wife (Rachel McAdams) is killed by a stray bullet. Billy, right on schedule,loses his fortune to a crooked manager (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson), his home and custody of his 10-year-old daughter, Leila. As you can imagine this would cause lots of pain and suffering to a person, and this is where Jake Gyllenhaal shines the brightest. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a knockout performance, he is so convincing, that the audience can actually feel his pain while watching the film. Forest Whitaker, 50 cent, and Rachel McAdams all deliver strong performances.<br/><br/>""Southpaw"" enters the long filmography of boxing flicks, and puts up a surprisingly good fight."

","I have no idea how one doesn't like this film. From the beginning it grabs your attention and you can't take your eyes off the screen. It's emotional and almost leaves you in tears because you can't help but feel for Billy Hope (Jake Gylenhall) but at the same time it's a kick-ass movie that everyone must go see. Jake Gylenhalls performance is astounding and I'll be upset if he does not get at least a nomination for best actor for this movie.

"Zulfmanauthor","9","1","4","26 July 2015"," A Triumph against the Odds!
","The portrayal of a modern day tragic hero who rises from the ashes in almost Herculean fashion could not have been better enacted than by Jake Gylenhaal. Jake remains one of the most remarkable actors of our time, the contrast could not have been bigger between his last performance in 'Nightcrawler',where he portrays a smart and cunning freelance reporter to now being 'Billy Hope', an enigmatic and obnoxious boxing champion who falls from grace, only to discover the true meaning of life. This ability to adapt so well and become the epitome of the character places Jake Gylenhaal in a league of the elite great actors. This movie 'Southpaw' depicts a favourite Hollywood theme, the fall and rise of a sporting great, this movie is 'Rocky' and 'Raging Bull' rolled into one and a few others. However it works, everything is bang on and hits the right buttons even though we know what is going to happen, we still anticipate and cheer on the fallen hero to redeem himself. Antoine Fuqua tries nothing new and doesn't even pretend to be original but he delivers an old fashioned movie about triumph which is so highly rated despite it being so unoriginal, that this is the real 'triumph' for all involved. This film is to fans of the great sporting movies what 'John Wick' was to action movie lovers, and that is being a throwback, a no nonsense tribute to what classic cinema is made of and why we loved movies in the first place. @zulfmanauthor"
"puma31219","7","1","4","25 July 2015"," Great film on many fronts.
","Great film. By now the down on his luck boxer who wins a very significant match just before the end of the fin has been done time and time again but this film has its own charm about it. The main character starting out as remarkably ""flawed"" creates a massive amount of sympathy for him as he evolves into someone much more responsible; someone that audience members want to see succeed. And although it took him losing everything to realize that change was needed, how he rose to the task created charisma for the character which sorely lacked in the beginning of the film. I thought that the film was very well casted with great performances from every corner. The simple dialogue (characters often repeating themselves in succession) gave the tone of the film a rawness to it that maintained my attention throughout. (Just couldn't wait to see what happened next) What also stood out to me was the cinematography during the fights. Great shots that captured the essence of the sport of boxing (which isn't really needed in a film where boxing is the focal point) whereas most boxing films point consistently to the characters, this film's fights did both. The fight choreography was very believable and not overdone. And the music score was perfect. Perhaps the only thing that gives this film a rating lower than 8 out of 10 stars, would be originality; as the battered boxer story is the paradigm for many great films. But this project definitely deserves a place among them."

","In this corner the champ ""Rocky III"". In this corner, the inadvertent remake ""Southpaw"". Gentlemen, keep the blows low and the fight dirty. BEGIN!<br/><br/>Round 1: Main character name. The champ comes out swinging with the titular title character ""Rocky"" invoking a time, place and ethnicity. The laughably bland main character name in ""South"" - Billy ""The Great"" Hope - sounds the writers were trying to come up with some intriguing name but eventually principal filming needed to start and they couldn't answer the question ""The Great"" what? Did they mean he is the Great Hope? But not the Great White Hope with it implicit kinda racist overtones? Anyway, few real boxer nicknames and no movie boxer nicknames can stand again the memorability of the ""Italian Stallion"". And the challenger is down and the fight end early!<br/><br/>Round 2: the kid: The challenger avoids the early knockout with Oona (that's a name?) Laurence's portrayal of Billy the Goat...er Great's daughter who is traumatized by the shooting death of her mother and Billy's incompetent parenting. While Laurence winds up just shouting at the televised climatic fight much like Ian Fried's Rocky, Jr. does, at least she has a character arc and some dramatic moment. Looks like the fight is on.<br/><br/>Round 3: the death that pushes the champion into a downward spiral: and we got ourselves a battle! We had 2 fully ""Rocky"" movies to come to know Burgess Meredith's Mickey Goldmill so his heart attack before the first Clubber Lang fight is affecting. However, given how much Billy and Leila rely on Maureen to parent them both, her shooting by Miguel Escobar's squad equals the pathos of Mickey's death.<br/><br/>Round 4: the baddie: Oh, and the champion comes back hard! The monster of 80's cheese Mr. T. somehow projects both a menacing and ludicrous screen presence. He plays the hungry, scrappy underdog that Rocky was before his Ferrari and house robot made him soft. Miguel ""Magic"" Escobar amounts to little more than off-the-shelf disrespectful thug with little to distinguish him from his crew.<br/><br/>Round 5: the savior trainer: But the challenger isn't done yet! The excellent Forest Whitaker plays the also unfortunately named Tick Willis (seriously, who came up with these character names?) He is kind to street kids and who takes on Billy when he is at his lowest point despite Billy treating him like crap and he is some kind of boxing training savant (his expertise is never explained). While the round goes to ""Southpaw"", Carl Weathers Apollo Creed (see, that's a great character name) is a mostly one note Rocky support system for Rocky but his physical attractiveness and easy smile makes his a highly engaging actor to watch on film.<br/><br/>Round 6: the big fight: And the challenger is against the ropes! The eventual Escobar Vs. Hope or ""Magic"" Vs. ""The Great"" battle excels at verisimilitude and therefore not so much at drama. An open Hollywood secret director Antoine Fuqua missed in film school is that while audiences complain about the lack of realism in movie boxing matches, they actually want them to include dozens of uncontested punches per round. Balboa Vs. Lang includes enough haymakers to give both men CTE before the ring girl strutted around the ring with the ""4"" card. When Jim Lampley's monolouging during the climatic Miguel / Hope showdown is the most interesting part of the proceedings, your fight staging is a little too accurate.<br/><br/>And the challenger is out! There won't be no rematch or a ""Southpaw"" sequel for that matter. The plodding, overly serious, staging of a story that's been done better multiple times before unfortunately wastes Gyllenhaal's impressive physical transformation. In short, ""Rocky!"", ""Rocky!"", Rocky!"""
"rmax304823","5","0","1","3 December 2016"," The Moral Equivalent of War?
","Jake Gyllenhaal and Forrest Whitaker are up to par in this knock-kneed drama about pugilism. Whitaker always brings a little something extra to each role, rarely menacing, rarely perceptive, but always listening carefully. Gyllenhaal, as has become traditional, is bloodied in the boxing ring. He has three things going for him as the movie opens. He can take all kinds of punches without falling down. (Watch De Niro do the same in HIS boxing movie.) He's motivated by anger. And he loves his family, the cute Rachel McAdams who isn't around long enough, and his devoted daughter. He's so good, he's the champion. Of course his face is all misshapen and his wife wants him to quit the ring but he's pretty uneducated (he can't spell ""incarcerated"") and it's all he knows how to do. His speech is already slurred.<br/><br/>At a party he meets the rising young star, Miguel Gomez, who is a very savvy and skilled fighter. Gomez flings a few ritual insults at Gyllenhaal's wife and daughter and the champ, being what he is, loses it. A fracas breaks out. Someone produces a pistol and McAdams is shot dead. As a result Gyllenhaal goes on a self-destructive binge and loses everything -- his house, his little daughter, his self respect, the esteem of the public, and the championship. He's now a bum living alone in a shabby hotel room.<br/><br/>Of course we've been here before -- the sports hero battling his inner demons. And here, as elsewhere, and as my TV Guide puts it, he seeks redemption. I wish that word would disappear from our vocabulary because it's so overused. Listen, I had to learn about ""redemption"" in Catechism and redemption is when you do some terrible wrong and then make up for it by becoming sort of spiritual and by doing good works. ""Redemption"" does not mean ""success regained."" It's closer to what Freud called ""undoing."" The only person Gyllenhaal abuses is Gyllenhaal.<br/><br/>That reminds me of my own career in the ring. In boot camp, they had try-outs for the boxing team. I knew nothing about boxing but my good friend Andy from Michigan accompanied me to the gym. He and I were outfitted with gloves the size of throw pillows and told to get in the ring and fool around. Well, Andy and I were buddies and didn't want to hit one another so we danced about and finally, bashfully, Andry swung his glove around in a long, slow loop large enough to trace the equator. I saw it coming and watched it curiously as it approached. It barely touched flesh and I was on my knees. End of ring career. Where was I? Yes. Well, now a desperate bum, Gyllenhaal finds an amateur trainer, Whittaker, and works his way up from cleaning the toilets to challenging Miguel Gomez for the championship. I will let you guess who wins. The scenes in the boxing ring are well done. When a guy misses, he misses fast, and only by half an inch, not by a mile. And the fighters actually seem to tag one another realistically. Whap -- a jab and the opponent's face is visibly knocked back.<br/><br/>That's about the end of the good parts. Antoine Fuqua directed and he seems not to know when to leave well enough alone, or else he's aiming for an audience of semi-moronic Neanderthals who can't tell that Gyllenhaal is being crushed while he cradles his bloody and dying wife in his arms. The scene is full of blubbering and cries and lasts about as long as the Mousterian Age. It's not just the direction. There is no evident motive for his daughter's alienation. I suppose she blames her Dad for her mother's death but it seems hard to understand why she should, since Dad had practically nothing to do with the shooting. (Impressive performance here by Naomie Harris as the Child Care Worker charged with the daughter's welfare.) Whittaker teaches Gyllenhaal to fight as a Southpaw but nothing at all comes of it. The final bout is touted as ""a revenge match"" -- repeated over and over. But revenge for what? Miguel, Gyllenhaal's opponent, had nothing to do with the killing, and neither did Gyllenhaal himself.<br/><br/>One wonder if it's at all possible to make a sports movie WITHOUT the hero falling from grace and finally ""finding redemption."" ""Rocky"" -- the first ""Rocky,"" not the egregious sequels -- was a good film about boxing and character and it ended realistically in a draw. This one is crowded with clichés and, what the hell, if the hero wants to find redemption let him join a monastery."

","Southpaw is a movie about a boxer struggling with the loss of his family. It was a big surprise to me that this movie wasn't completely focused on boxing, and I was pleasantly surprised by how well-done it is. <br/><br/>The plot is not at all what I expected. Although then again, I never even read the plot summary. I just assumed that it was another boxing movie. The movie is much more focused on the characters' lives after their loss instead someone trying to become a pro boxer, mostly because that someone already is a pro boxer. While I noticed that, towards the end, there were a small handful of clichés that were indulged in, they were only indulged in because they made sense for the plot. The only reason why some parts were cliché or formulaic was because the movie industry has used them to death, so when the clichés actually have a legitimate reason for happening they stand out because of what we have done to them. However, the small amount of clichés that I actually noticed were so minuscule that it barely mattered. <br/><br/>The characters are the major driving force of this movie, and they are great. The actors are all fantastic, with Jake Gyllenhaal reminding me once again why I love him as an actor, Rachel McAdams pulling off a likable mother and wife, and even Oona Laurence playing Billy Hope's daughter was great. Everyone else really helped sell their characters, and while most of them weren't horribly unique characters, the three main ones that I just listed really shone, especially Gyllenhaal and his character, Billy Hope. The realism of the characters was great, and I found the main character in particular to be quite relatable. Thanks to the great performances and characters, this movie tends to be very hard to watch at times, and that's a good thing. If a movie can make you feel something for the characters themselves then that's already a feat on it's own. Considering I was cringing and sighing throughout, I think that that proves that this was a success. <br/><br/>The ending was incredible. I don't think I've ever been that into a climax before, but I was excitedly twitching and shaking for the entire time. It was great, and I loved every second of it. <br/><br/>Overall Southpaw is amazing. It's unique, filled with characters to care for, well-acted, and featuring one of the best endings I've ever seen. While the clichés were there, and they did stand out at times, they really didn't distract me because of how amazing the rest of the movie was, and how much sense they made.

The trailer caught my attention a while back, but the excellent reviews were the final selling point. I watched this movie on Blu-ray. First, the director, Anthony Fuquoa, is a very passionate one. You can feel that something is different in the way this movie is directed. He is a professional boxer, so this brings ghe real feel to this movie.Every boxing move is authentic. He adopts a different perspective. The whole movie i felt like the main character was real, his family was real and all those strong emotions came to live from the screen. I do not particularly enjoy watching boxing, but the moves and action in this movie was purely captivating, even for a female. Secondly, the cast team is BRILLIANT. starting from Jake, Rachel, Forester and even Oona. They made this movie come to life and be relatable. I cried, laughed and experienced a full range of feelings along this small family and the rest of the characters. On top of action, great cast and exciting boxing scenes, we have a great, deep storyline. All in all, this movie exceeds expectations and it feels like a breath of fresh air from the regular cheesy, no sense making, Hollywood recent movies. I hope that there will be a sequel."

","Overall, this was a rather clichéd movie, with no real surprises. I found the early fight scenes rather unrealistic. This guy who was supposed to be a world champion with no defeats lets his head be used like a punching bag, with no attempt to block or weave to avoid being hit. It seems unimaginable that someone could become a champion without these basic skills. Later on, after losing his title, his wife, and the custody of his daughter, he is taken on by a new trainer who teaches him some defensive skills, including a very awkward stance where he clumsily raises his shoulder. Very strange indeed. Must say that the protagonist looked the part, and must have worked hard to develop his ripped physique. Of course, he goes on to win his title back, and regains the custody of his daughter. Not a brilliant movie, but good enough to help pass some of the time on a nine hour plane trip."

"lucasversantvoort","7","0","1","18 November 2015"," Remarkable acting and psychological details
","It sure is a sad predicament for boxing films: they're one of the most predictable genres imaginable yet have the potential to be extremely fulfilling. Sure, they usually follow patterns so similar you could draw a graph, but when they're done well, the drama trumps any narrative predictability. However, there's a limit to how much drama I can take...<br/><br/>Billy Hope is the defending Light Heavyweight champion. The film opens with the fight in which he has to defend his title for the fourth time. This he does, but not before sustaining serious head injuries, resulting in eight stitches. His wife, Maureen, tries to convince him to retire and focus on his family. After all, she says, their future memories as a family would be tainted if his face looked like mashed potatoes. (That's not literally what she says, but you get the idea...) They both attend a charity event for the orphanage they both grew up in. A potential rival boxer shows his face and taunts Billy...successfully. A fight ensues and in the ensuing mayhem, Maureen is accidentally shot. Needless to say, Billy ends up in a downward spiral until he loses his job, his money, his house, even his daughter Leila who ends up in the hands of Child Protective Services. Billy must now collect what's left of himself and fight (figuratively speaking) to regain custody of his daughter.<br/><br/>If you've seen any sports film, let alone any boxing film, you'll be quite familiar with the structure: it all goes wrong before it all goes oh so right. It's thus left to story and character development to save the day. After all, it's not so much about the boxing itself as the characters and the buildup. Fortunately for us, the story is very well told, abetted by some strong acting by Gyllenhaal, McAdams and 13-year old Oona Laurence who plays Leila. Gyllenhaal and McAdams are able to suggest a shared history in the few scenes they have together and Laurence is very convincing. When she watches the final fight on TV, she's simultaneously scared and exhilarated.<br/><br/>The characterization is also convincing and full of interesting psychological details. I once heard that people who've just lost someone dear to them have a tendency to still refer to them in the present tense. This can be seen in the film after Maureen has died. Leila tells Billy, after he just turned off the light, that she ""keeps the light on."" Emphasis on 'keep', obviously. Or the attention to psychological detail in the appropriately nauseating death scene. Or the scenes involving Billy trying to repair his relationship with Leila.<br/><br/>So yeah, the drama is presented very convincingly...almost too convincingly. And this is the one downside: there's perhaps too much drama. This is a strange accusation, because all the drama is necessary. It doesn't feel like there are any superfluous scenes, but the end result is unrelentingly tragic and requires a great deal of stamina. Fortunately, because it's all well-written and acted, this isn't exactly a herculean effort. The only subplot that fails completely involves one of the kids at the gym Billy ends up going to, but I won't go into specifics.<br/><br/>In the end, I couldn't help but really like Southpaw. Yeah, you know where it's going, but the strong acting and psychological details make up for it. Watch it."

","Watching the first 10 minutes of this movie reminded me of ""The Fighter"" but getting into it i saw many plot keys from the Rocky movies. The financial state (those who watch it will understand) is similar to Rocky V and several scenes are a ""copy paste"" some would say. <br/><br/>This aside, the emotional part of the movie takes off and never lets go till the very end. <br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal, Forest Whitaker and Oona Laurence are proof that better actors can carry a plot and keep your interest up even when the plot is..maybe, lacking. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, its a good movie to watch and appreciate the dramatic atmosphere."
"Gary-ks","4","0","1","9 November 2015"," Extremely ""Hollywoodic"" and not very realistic.
","I gave my vote of 4 for decent performance by lead actors. Gyllenhaal is one of the best actors out there and Whitaker always was one of the greatest. Other than that the movie is extremely unrealistic tear squeezer - from the start point, where the main character depicted as sort of a brawler boxer who win his fights by getting beaten for ten rounds and then managing to land a lucky punch to knockdown his opponent, through Hopes fallout and to his expected comeback at the end. Most of the issues I have with this movie have broadly discussed by others here so I only want to expand on the closing scene of the movie, which in my opinion is simply moronic.<br/><br/>----------Big spoiler---------- So this is how it goes: Hope's daughter flies to Las Vegas accompanied by her social worker. She seems to be exited as if she were to watch Frozen movie and not to see her father get bitten. The fight goes like it supposed to, Billy Hope is getting bitten and out-boxed at every round. At some point he recalls that he actually can protect himself and he starts doing so. By the way, if you were thinking that Billy is a southpaw boxer as the movie title may suggest you were wrong - he is not. Southpaw refers to some weird move that Billy's coach taught him just before the fight. And there you go, 10 sec before last round end Billy switches his stance for the first time in his career and with a devastating uppercut knocks his opponent down and although he managed to come up, the time is off. Billy Hope wins by split decision and back to the track. For me, this ending is an apotheoses of southpaw's grotesque story line, a hollywoodized drama genre that converges to ""Be good and everything will be right"" maxim."

","Billy Hope, also known as Billy The Great, is the reigning heavyweight champion of the world carrying a 43-0 record. He has a notable career, loving family and a very extravagant lifestyle. However, due to Billy's temper, his wife is shot dead. Billy's life gets turned upside down; he goes into deep depression, looses his house, fortune, friends, and most importantly his daughter. Billy, desperate to get his life back, swallows his pride and seeks help from trainer Trick Willis, who then will train him back to victory.<br/><br/>Billy's fight to get his life back and reclaim the trust from those he loves is inspiring. Although the plot was not very original, the story of Billy Hope is extremely strong. The way the storyline is portrayed and accuracy of how one thing in life can affect someone in the hardest and worse ways possible. The emotions in the movie from happy, mad, sad and even funny are what makes this movie so great. It was definitely a tear jerker for most. <br/><br/>The whole tone of Southpaw lies in the hands of Jake Gyllenhall. Gyllenhall's performance was outstanding and a very realistic portrayal of what a boxer's life would look like. His character has many different emotions and Gyllenhall creates them all as if it were real. Gyllenhall not only had to undergo a total physical transformation to prepare for his time on screen, but also had to make sure he was on point with slurring his speech and showing passion for boxing and his daughter. Jack Gyllenhall's performance in Southpaw was definitely his best one yet. Another outstanding character is Forest Whitaker, who plays Hope's trainer, Trick Willis. Their relationship in the film is real and very moving. They both bring out the best in each other and the whole setting of the movie would be lost without their relationship. <br/><br/>The majority of the movie is boxing scenes and these are done explicitly. They are very clear and concise, and every movement and the camera angles keep your attention drawled. The audience sees every punch followed by the jiggling in the face, all the blood, sweat and tears each boxer gives out and the swollen, black eyes they receive. The action keeps the audience engaged and wanting to see more. <br/><br/>Yes, this movie isn't Rock or Million Dollar Baby or the first boxing movie to ever exist, but it is a new story that makes the audience have a great amount of emotion. This is a unique story about redemption that the producer put his own spin on. There is a certain gratification that is derived from the journey of Billy, and at the end of His journey the audience is left feeling like anything is possible. <br/><br/>I would encourage anyone who likes a very real acted, emotional, heart touching, inspiring film to go watch Southpaw."
"markbowen","4","0","1","5 October 2015"," Clichéd and contrived
","I'll say this for Jake Gyllenhaal: I don't think any other currently working actor physically commits to a role as much as he does. He went from the spindly, underweight creep in 2014's ""Nightcrawler"" to a totally ripped boxer in 2015's ""Southpaw."" As far as physicality is concerned, Gyllenhaal is 100% believable as a boxer. Unfortunately, that's where the plausibility of this film pretty much begins and ends.<br/><br/>In a very short time span (even the supposed time frame within the movie), we see Gyllenhaal's Billy Hope go from undisputed world light heavyweight champion to losing literally all of his money and living in the projects. All this happens because another boxer mouths off to Billy at a charity event, which leads to fisticuffs and a gun going off that kills Billy's wife! The other boxer takes the gun from his crew member who fired it, but even though the police are en route and he's at the center of the incident, he is not caught with the gun and is never formally implicated.<br/><br/>From there it's a very quick slide downhill, as Billy loses his title and is even suspended from the sport, followed by further descent as he loses his daughter into state custody, and somehow losing every single thing he owns and even every last nickel. Even though he's a famous sports personality, overnight he goes from living in a mansion to living in the projects working as a janitor. Again, even in the movie's time frame this is all a matter of weeks.<br/><br/>He needs to train and he needs work, so he finds a dirty old gym and a tough, no-nonsense trainer. Meanwhile, the boxer at the center of the murder of Billy's wife is now the light heavyweight champion. After a single exhibition match, Billy is offered a chance at the title! If you're thinking this sounds familiar, yes it is, you've seen in 100 times. Do you wonder how it will end? No, you don't. You know how it will end.<br/><br/>""Southpaw"" borrows from dozens of films -- from pretty much every sports movie ever, but most notably the ""Rocky"" movies (in particular ""Rocky V,"" I think), ""The Karate Kid"" movies, ""The Wrestler,"" and ""The Champ,"" and no cliché is too clichéd for the filmmakers. Yes, there is even a training montage!<br/><br/>That's all a shame, too, because Billy Hope and his wife's shared background (both orphans) has the making for an interesting story, and there are some fine actors on hand, including Gyllenhaal, Forest Whitaker, and Rachel McAdams. Unfortunately, McAdams is only allowed to be the standard boxer's wife nagging her husband to quit the sport or risk brain damage, before being unceremoniously killed off, while Whitaker is stuck playing a combination of Mr. Miyagi, Eddie Dupris and Mickey Goldmill.<br/><br/>Within these limitations, each actor has his moments, especially Gyllenhaal. In fact, there are several scenes that work well on their own, but on the whole the movie just doesn't add up to anything but another ""champion becomes underdog and becomes champion again"" film."

","Based on the reviews of this film I was full of hope and optimism for a thoroughly good film. Boy was I disappointed. I'll keep this short as possible as it's my personal opinion and a bit of a rant at the same time.<br/><br/>I did not, at any point feel sorry for the main character. The daughter yes, as the circumstances of the story were tragic for the young one however the main character in my eyes was nothing more than a thug with major mental health issues. One might even say he is a few tiles short for a full roof.<br/><br/>Yes the death of his wife was tragic, yes I understand he would be absolutely lost but what normal person would then go ahead portraying themselves like that. Best thing for thugs like that is take them to the Soylent Green factory, at least then they will contribute something worthwhile to society! There is no need in society for complete lunatics like his character portrayed themselves. Some people are likening this to Rocky which is absolute rubbish. Not once did the character of Rocky start being a complete and utter nutcase.<br/><br/>I've watched some brilliant dramas over time, ones that really did give you that ""lump in the throat"" feeling for the characters facing hardship and/or loss. I watched this film feeling practically emotionless.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm getting grumpy in my old age, certainly less tolerant of wastes of space, scumbags but this is one film I shall not be recommending to anyone.<br/><br/>I can see many people adore this film and they obviously have a different take on the main character but fundamentally, for me, I would, if I could, steer well clear of any film whose main storyline revolves around a nutcase who ""makes it good in the end"". Sorry but you have to be slightly ""tapped"" in the head to be capable of being that person in the first place."

","It's not a secret that the vast majority of sports movies contain the same three primary ingredients by nature: 1 - A bleak event that occurs in the protagonists life causing interference with their career - the spaghetti. <br/><br/>2 - The training montage inserted at the mid-point in the movie, designed to motivate the audience and instigate the sensation that you've gained something by watching this, hence you now think the movie was good - the tomato sauce. <br/><br/>3 - The twist at the end that provides the viewer with a sense of closure that the protagonists they have come to feel for, have now won or lost. Success or justified failure, The resolution for the viewers sake. - The minced meat.<br/><br/>You may be wondering how I could possibly give this movie 9 stars after identifying it as a recipe for spaghetti bolognese. However there's one ingredient that Southpaw has that makes it stand alone against most other movies of the same genre: The grated Parmesan that is the fact that these three fundamental elements are actually done extremely well. <br/><br/>Superb acting from Jake Gyllenhaal makes Antoine Fuqua's job extremely easy, to the point that all he has to do is point the camera at him. Gyllenhall's acting in the common cliché tomato sauce scenes is what moves the audience and really makes you root for Billy Hope and his daughter. <br/><br/>I am sure critics are presenting the plot as having a 'Rockyesque' ending and argue that there is too much positive 'feel good' touches to the film. However I would urge those critics to re-watch southpaw and identify the attention to detail of authentic movement in each fighting scene, the unwarranted good acting from 12-year-old Clare Foley, and the subtle unidentified presentation of inner turmoil from Forest Whitaker that leaves it up to the viewer to make what they will of what his character has experienced, through facial expressions and limited articulation. <br/><br/>9 stars because these are 2 hours that you definitely have not wasted sitting in front of a screen."

","This is defiantly one of the best films I have seen in ages. I am not sure why some people are giving such a hard time. Yes it does rely a lot on the performance of Gyllenhall but it would not be the first or the last film to rely on the main actor to carry the film. OK the plot does not take much working out and if you have seen the trailer you would have a good idea what's going to happen. But it does not mater when you have performances like these. The director defiantly gets it right most of the time and pulls on the heart strings just enough before getting on with the rest of the film. Forest Whitaker is great as you would except and Rachel McAdams hold her own in a male dominate movie. The only thing I would says is the part dealing with Hoppy the kid from the gym. It ether needed dropping completely or expanding so we could see his home life etc. But all in all a great movie, any more realistic than some boxing movies there have been over the years.

"shashikumar3100","7","0","1","9 September 2015"," Watch it for Jake Gyllenhaal
","Jake Gyllenhaal steals the show in cliché sports drama feature ""Southpaw"" directed by Antoine Fuqua. This movie roots its origins from the real life of the famous rapper Eminem but here Jake plays a boxer. We know Eminem is a rapper but this film only derives the ideas from his life; becoming avant-garde and successful, then losing himself in the brinks of melancholy and finally rising again with a legendary recovery. The movie portrays the life of a boxer, Billy Hope played by Jake Gyllenhaal. He is the heavyweight champion and lives with his wife Maureen Hope played by Rachel McAdams and daughter Leila Hope played by Oona Laurence. Antoine Fuqua has directed the movie quite well and this can be considered his best direction so far. Having already directed movies like ""Training Day"" and last year's ""The Equalizer"", Southpaw delivers elements of direction in a brilliant manner and tries to explore some important parts in life on a psychological level. The story is simple and may look like new wine in an old bottle but the performances have made this movie a must-watch. Kurt Sutter, the writer makes it a sports formula movie dramatised with usual and contemporary fiction. He could have done a better job to come out with some newly explored ideas to make the movie a better treat. The dialogues aren't that good but the superb acting makes their orientation look familiar to us. Coming to the acting department, it can be said that Jake Gyllenhaal yet again shows that he is truly a talented actor who deserves to be applauded more often. He portrays the character with immense vigour in the fight sequences and as the emotionally depressed and drugged father. He depicts the character so strong that it's hard to forget him after having watched the movie. Rachel McAdams has a short role but does justice to it. She plays a rich, beautiful wife who is considerate about her family. Forest Whitaker plays the trainer Tick Wills who is fine as per the character in the movie. 50 cent is an utter disappointment but one character that also flourishes is the child Leila Hope. Oona Laurence plays the character pleasingly and one can find glimpses of true emotional part in the movie from her complementary acting with Jake. The overall soundtrack is magnificent in the movie, with two awe-inspiring songs from Eminem. The music keeps up with the pace of the movie. Cinematography is perceived to be excellent despite the plot being straightforward. Overall, it's a good movie of 2015 and merits from the presence of ferocious and breathtaking acting skills from Jake Gyllenhaal. Do watch this movie if you like sports drama with a perfect blend of hip-hop music to the rescue."

","Reviewed July 26th, 2015 after 1st viewing (Theatrical 2D) Escape Artists / Fuqua Films - Directed by: Antoine Fuqua<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua does it again! This dark and gritty story is a prime example of how you must sometimes necessarily fall to rise. Southpaw (2015) is the tale of a young boxer by the name of Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) who along with his lovely wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) came up in the system together. <br/><br/>Rachel McAdams as his wife and Oona Lawrence as his daughter do a fantastic job pulling on your heartstrings. They really worked as a believable family dynamic, with Maureen always being responsible for running their daily activities and his career. Your heart is truly broken by the end of the first act. I cannot speak highly enough of Oona's performance—I was truly captivated by her.<br/><br/>After losing it all, he seeks the help of a local trainer (Forest Whitaker) trying to make a difference in affected youths' lives. Hope must learn how to set aside his vanity and pride for the sake of his daughter, and embarks on a life-changing journey to reconnect with his daughter. I really found his daughter's displacement to be equally heart-wrenching and believable.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Hope is nothing short of impressive, choosing to train extensively not only for the physicality of the role, but for the emotional depth as well. Fuqua's direction serves to convey the realism and grittiness of their lives, truly captivating the audience from the beginning. The interplay between the score and soundtrack surprisingly works well. The pace is just right, never slowing down enough to cause you to lose interest. I was truly surprised at how emotionally invested I was early on, which I attribute largely to the acting talent.<br/><br/>Even though it is a bit formulaic, it winds up being irrelevant, as you are on this ride with Hope the entire way, rooting for him all-the-while knowing he will get there with his determination. The film actually works on a number of levels, drawing and maintaining your interest whether you for the boxing and the soundtrack or the human interest story, it was masterfully rolled into one dynamic.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I was truly amazed at not only how the film captured my interest, but my heart—even when I knew what would happen in the first act. All of the elements came together beautifully, and I wound up loving what I expected to be a mediocre boxing film. There's so much more than meets the eye here.<br/><br/>8.0 of 10.0"

A lot of people will be surprised and shocked at how great this film came out to be. I think if more sport films were shot and directed like this we would have a better understanding as to what it really is that professional athletes go through when the audience has settled down and went home from being entertained. I'm still shocked that Eminem turned this role down if he brought the same A+ game as he did in 8 Mile I could possibly see him as an Oscar nominee."
"ArchonCinemaReviews","8","0","1","2 September 2015"," Powerful performances and an emotional story.
","Written by Kurt Sutter and directed by Antoine Fuqua, Southpaw acts as a showcase for its talent and a testosterone fueled story perfect for masculine viewers.<br/><br/>Reigning undefeated light heavyweight boxing champion Billy Hope's (Jake Gyllenhaal) life comes crumbling down around him when he loses his wife senselessly in a tragic accident. He must turn to trainer Tick Willis (Forest Whitaker) for help and guidance to get back on track, so that he may not only return to the boxing stage but also so he can regain his daughter from child protective services.<br/><br/>The trailers for Southpaw are pretty terrible, and I think that opinion is pretty unanimous among movie goers. It showcases a majority of the narrative's plot arc and is cheesy in its desperate ploy to appeal to a large range of viewers rather than the niche audience it is made for. And a trailer that lacks clarity tells me that the film it is marketing is without intent or a clear vision. Regardless, looking past the nonsense, there was something about the film that intrigued me enough to give it a chance.<br/><br/>Though the film is about fighting, it more about grief, loss and redemption. The circumstances and tragedy surrounding the loss of Billy Hope's wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) is well created to make the blow devastating. The character development is rich so that you know Maureen is Billy's everything, and you feel the pain in your heart, down to your soul. This hurt never subsides for the main character or the audience through the duration of the film and is the driving force behind the narrative.<br/><br/>It is an amazingly smart decision to choose Rachel McAdams to play the protagonist's wife. McAdams is inherently likable to audiences but is a stellar actress, and her performance is that of an athlete's wife. Her Maureen is not selfless or perfect, she is invested and cares for her man and his livelihood. And her performance for the short time her character is on screen is enough to sustain the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal has proved himself a phenomenal actor in recent years for those who were skeptical of his earlier work. We have always known he is a talent and Southpaw might be his crowning achievement as of yet, though that seems to be said every year. He is transformative without even a glimmer of himself left lurking in his eyes and he truly loses himself in Billy Hope. The character is a bit of a stereotype, with clichés peppered in his backstory, but Gyllenhaal's creation of the character transcends far beyond those limiting incidentals.<br/><br/>You can't talk about performances in his film without mentioning the talented actress who plays Gyllenhaal's daughter, Oona Laurence. I don't know how or from where this girl draws this complex hurt she is able to convey on screen, but without her this film would not be nearly as stellar as it is in its completion.<br/><br/>As a film about boxing, it goes well beyond the glitz and awe people imagine when they see the ring under the lights. Southpaw shows the family life, the pain, the hurt, the healing, the reality, and the humanity. The cinematography contributes to that, putting you in the ring so you almost feel the blood splash on your face as fighters pummel one another.<br/><br/>I don't quite get the other critics stating this film is dull and lumbering, it is decisive in its vision and shows storytelling at its purest.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases."

"stephendaxter","7","0","2","30 August 2015"," Another stellar Gyllenhaal performance up against a plot with nothing new
","Southpaw is a Boxing Drama starring one of, if not THE BEST character actors of today Jake Gyllenhaal. Now, boxing dramas have been around forever, and there are a tonne of them, some good and some bad, so this definitely had a lot of competition that it would be constantly compared to. Although it is not the best one we have seen it is definitely better than most. The main draw of this film was the cast, i will see any film that has Jake Gyllenhaal in it regardless of what it was about and you also have Rachel McAdams and Forest Whitaker to back him up so it had the cast in its favour. Where this movie differentiates from other boxing films are the moments away from the ring, because to be honest by now we have seen almost everything that can be shown in boxing films. That is really the only thing i found that let the film down, the fact that it didn't offer anything new made it predictable in that you knew what the main beats were going to be after the 30 minute mark. Although the boxing fights were extremely well choreographed and some of the better fights i have seen in these films it wasn't enough to have me engaged in those sections of the film. <br/><br/>This film strives in two particular areas, the performances, and the emotional weight of the film. I will start with talking about the level of emotion that is expressed and explored be these characters over the course of the film. The thing that had me almost completely invested in the film was how Gyllenhaal's character would deal with certain tragedies in his life and evolve throughout the film and how the relationships he had with certain characters would change and affect him. Stuff like this is what surprised me about the film, i realised from the trailer that the more emotional and meaningful moments would play a huge part in the film but i had no idea that it would be one of the best things about it. Watching this man who is forced to overcome set-backs in his personal and professional life for the people he loves was a great story that completely overtook the film for me and helped me really enjoy it. At first it may look like the main plot and the boxing matches would guide the film and the emotional moments would be thrown in here and there, but by the end you realise that it is the emotions being expressed by the characters and the ways they choose to deal with them that take the film from the start to the end. <br/><br/>But, this film would be no-where near as good as it was if there was an absence of Jake Gyllenhaal because he stole the film and delivered yet another gripping and intense performance that you can't forget. This man proves again and again why i think he is one of the best character actors to have lived, because you can tell from watching his films the amount of dedication this guy puts into his roles. He is so good that you don't see Jake Gyllenhaal, you don't see the guy from Brokeback Mountain in this film, you see Billy Hope as with all of his other films. Just look at his transition both mentally and physically from last years masterpiece 'Nightcrawler' where he played a weird skinny reporter to this film where he is absolutely ripped and plays an emotionally damaged boxer. The versatility this guys brings to his roles makes his films so much more enjoyable. Look at Donnie Darko, Enemy, Nightcrawler, all very different and all very incredible and we can add this performance to the list now. <br/><br/>But thats enough about Gyllenhaal because Forest Whitaker also brings a tonne of emotional depth into the film. He fully commits to his role and just adds another great performance to his list of many. And your supporting cast of Rachel McAdams and surprisingly the young Oona Lawrence were great in mainly assisting in adding to the character of Billy and guiding his journey.<br/><br/>But in the end the film is kinda dragged down by a weak and predictable plot but the emotional weight of the film and stellar performances lift it up to become another good boxing drama. - 7"

","Well... I mean, boxing films... they will never go away. And neither will their formula. It's a question of how well their formula is executed (Raging Bull remains the only boxing film I've ever seen that transcends to actual greatness). I thought this was good, if a little unfocused and dull in its second act. I remember seeing the ""and Rachel McAdams"" in the opening credits and found it weird that she wasn't second billed to Jake, but thought ""whatever"" (take note, I had read absolutely nOTHING about the plot summary for this so all i had to go by was the poster. Granted, I was unbelievably shocked that they killed her off, but as it is, only those first 30 minutes were great. Jake Gyllenhaal is definitely great here, but as unbelievable as many pointed him out to be? Naaah, and certainly not close to his searing, monumental performance in last year's Nightcrawler, but it's yet another great performance in a career that seems to be getting stronger and stronger every year. He's one of the best actors currently working and his dedication shows. He's definitely the best reason to see it. I'm not a huuuge McAdams fan, but I thought she made such a strong impact and presence that when she left I felt like i had also lost her. Amazing acting by both her and Jake during her death scene, certainly some of the best work she's ever done."

","The movie is indeed very predictable and a true cliché in terms of the story. It feels like someone blends in the Rocky-Junior relationship drama from Rocky V and the comeback drama from Rocky III then added the wife's death as the linking trigger. Also the movie presents to many plots that it didn't do enough justice in closing, such as the side plots with the crew, with Hoppy, and even with Tick. Yet the movie still stands tough with its exquisite acting performance. Jake Gyllenhaal deserves most of the credit for this as he really nailed both parts of his role as the father and the fighter. Rachel McAdams, although only in the movie for about half an hour, made sure her presence felt significant and her absence influential. Oona Laurence is surprising as she can really balance both McAdams and Gyllenhaal's acting. Forest Whitaker's performance really completes the movie's awesome acting level in general."
"burlesonjesse5","6","0","1","24 August 2015"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Southpaw
","Jake Gyllenhaal just blows me away. As an actor, he completely transforms himself profusely and in a way, excessively. You watch him play a Travis Bickle type in last year's Nightcrawler and a pitted fighter in 2015's Southpaw (my latest review). Honestly, it's really hard to tell that it's the same guy. He's the best and maybe the only reason to see this conventional, sort of Rocky retread, a boxing flick directed by the guy who made Training Day. Yo Adrian guess what, Antoine did it! Antoine did it!<br/><br/>In terms of storyline and/or premise, Southpaw is a typical take on the whole riches to rags to riches concept. It's fall from grace and then grace again. The direction is careful, the soundtrack is rap-infused (which sort of kills any dramatic momentum at key points), and the antagonist thwarts the words ""b*tch"" and ""belt"" via multiple sentences. There's blood, there's sweat, and there's tears. Oh and Eminem to boot.<br/><br/>Written by the guy who penned TV's Sons of Anarchy (Kurt Sutter) and released by The Weinstein Company (this initially, was not the case), ""Paw"" chronicles scruffy, ripped Billy Hope (Gyllenhaal). He's the World Light Heavyweight champion, a fighting monster with the mind of a ticking time bomb. Early on in the film, he defends his title. Cut to the next hour and a half and he loses everything that's important to him. Southpaw unequivocally starts with a devastating twist (which I won't reveal). Things then detour from cheery sports territory to flat- out, hard drama.<br/><br/>Now as mentioned earlier, Southpaw procreates the feel and attitude of all six Rocky movies combined. There's a funeral (just revert back to Mickey kicking the bucket in Rocky III), a final fight sequence (just think of every installment except ""V""), a scene where a character is lying dead and no one bothers to help or contact the paramedics (just like when Apollo went down in ""IV""), a house getting repossessed (just like when Stallone lost his mansion again in ""V""), plenty of bloody and unrealistic fight enactments (this was in every Rocky pic), plenty of scantily clad ring girls (""III"" had the best assortment of this), the obligatory training montage (""I"", ""II"", ""III"", ""IV"", and Rocky Balboa had this), and a villainous opponent bent on harassing the hero not to mention his beautiful wife (remember Clubber Lang in ""III""?). In truth, the only difference between ""Paw"" and all things Rocky, is the R rating due to harsher language (Mr. Balboa wasn't into spouting off F-words). Oh and N.Y.C. substitutes for Philly this time around.<br/><br/>Italian Stallion imitations aside, Southpaw also is pretty manipulative when trying to get its point across. The film is loosely based on true events (uh, not really) and it's a playbook for tragedy. Everything that happens seems inserted or staged to keep the narrative afloat. So OK, let's take away Billy Hope's wife (check). Then, let's take away his kid and give Hope only supervised visits (check). Let's give him anger issues and have him suspended by the boxing commission (check). Let's leave him broke and penniless, living in a rundown apartment on 100 whatever street (chickity-check). Let's give him illegal guns in his mansion and a problem with drugs/alcohol (check-o-slovakia). Oh and let's foreclose on his humbled abode in record time (I saw this flick with my father. He's a realtor and he said there's no way this process could happen so quickly).<br/><br/>In conclusion, this two hour-plus, depression fest is almost recommendable because of Gyllenhaal's amazing dedication to his craft. There's also decent performances including Forest Whitaker as his reluctant trainer (he plays Titus ""Tick"" Wills) and rapper 50 Cent as his character's fight promoter, Jordan Mains. But with its lack of powerful vigor and total shortage of flask originality, Southpaw sadly, goes ""south"". My rating: 2 and a half stars."
"tdevil9","6","0","1","23 August 2015"," Rocky 3 with rap
","I can't help drawing similarities in the storyline between this and Rocky 3. Admittedly, I went to watch this movie for Rachel McAdams. The title ""Southpaw"" was a bit misleading because it doesn't really lend any importance to the character nor the story. The 2nd half of the movie was much much better than the first. In the first half, we see the main character portrayed as a gangster wannabe who thinks he's indestructible. When he is ultimately hit with a dosage of reality, we see him slide rapidly into stupidity and irresponsibility. I find this very hard to believe. The ending is very Hollywood and I hated it because it just would not happen in real life. Yeah yeah, escapism and all that... but honestly - so far fetched? In summary, not a bad film and a nice remake of Rocky 3. But that's all it was for me."

","A fighter knows only one way to work. -Billy Hope<br/><br/>Walking into the cinema... Is there anything new to be said about the life of boxers? <br/><br/>Overall Rating: 2.75 stars Cinematic rating: 3 stars Bigger questions rating: 2.75 stars <br/><br/>As the current boxing Light Heavyweight world champion, Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) has come to a crossroads. The sport has taken a toll on his body and he has sustained an eye injury that forces him to take the advice of his wife, Maureen (Rachel McAdams), and consider the next step in his career, retirement or going out on top with an HBO contract. During a charity event, a verbal altercation turns to a series of violent acts that lead to the shooting death of Maureen. Due to this tragedy and Billy's desire for revenge, he starts down a path of self-destruction through the use of alcohol and drugs. During this vulnerable stage of his life, he attempts to hold onto his life style, sanity and daughter, Leila (Oona Laurence), by going back into the ring. This choice leads to a series of events which leaves him suspended from boxing, penniless and having to turn Leila over to Child Protective Services. During his life's downward spiral, Billy must find a way to sober up and get Leila back. His only solution is to go back to the only option he knows, the boxing ring. First he works as a janitor in a gym, but gets to know the trainer Titus ""Tick"" Wills (Forest Whitaker). After getting his life back on track, Billy convinces Tick to become his personal trainer and eventually help him to prepare for a bout with the man who he credits with leading to his downfall. Southpaw is a familiar boxing tale of riches to rags to redemption where Billy Hope has to reach deep within himself to find the man he needs to be for his daughter and to rediscover the champion that he had been to the world as a boxer.<br/><br/>Two men pummelling each other in a ring for money has been a storyline since the inception of moving pictures. It provides a brutal backdrop to the human experience at its most visceral level. Besides the original Rocky and Million Dollar Baby, these stories of boxers tend to be elemental and predictable. In the hands of director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day), there is an expectation that he will rely heavily on the performance of his lead actor to win over the audience and pull the story along. Was Fuqua able to achieve this goal? It is a split decision. Jake Gyllenhaal proves that he can carry a film and channels his method acting prowess to make the character, Billy Hope, believable and vulnerable. Gyllenhaal always seems to be on the verge of acting greatness, but super stardom seems to allude this acting journeyman. Fuqua surrounds his lead actor with a stellar cast that give the potential depth for a ground breaking film. Forrest Whitaker effortlessly steals each scene that he shares with any actor and is convincing as the flawed, but inspirational trainer. Also, the impressive young actress, Oona Laurence,shows her acting abilities and has the potential for a long career. But, even with all of these key acting strengths there is something missing in Fugua's corner. It is not the thespian talent, but the overdone storyline. The story can be compared to the punching bags in Tick Wills gym. The bags and the script feel like they are past their prime, the bags are held together by tape and on the edge of falling apart with each ensuing punch. The same could be said about Fuqua's story, it feels like it has been overworked and is past its prime. Southpaw contains enough original components to make it entertaining, but not enough to pull it off the canvas of a run of the mill boxing film. <br/><br/>As Billy is trying to get his life up off the ring floor, he begins to develop a strong bond with Tick Wills. As a mentor and trainer, Tick becomes the voice of reason and reluctantly leads Billy down the path to redemption. During one of the more poignant scenes, they consider one of the tragic occurrences that occurs in the history of this gym in Hell's Kitchen. Tick evaluates the suffering that occurs in his life and in the lives of his boxers and says, 'All I can think is that God must have a purpose for all of this.' It is one of the more endearing scenes in the film and it does open the door to one of life's paradoxes. If there is a God out there, why does he allow bad things to occur and is there a purpose in it all? Southpaw may be a well worn story of a boxer's life, but it does provide a great opportunity to consider why the life that each of us has been given can be bittersweet at times, but it can have a purpose. <br/><br/>Leaving the cinema... Southpaw was endearing, but forgettable. It has a mean one-two punch. Good director and solid acting performances, but in the end this is not enough to deliver a knock-out visual experience. <br/><br/>Reel Dialogue: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible say about boxing? (1 Corinthians 9:26, 2 Timothy 4:7) 2. Does this life have any purpose? (Jeremiah 29:11, Ephesians 3:8-12) 3. What does this life have to offer?

","The Movies at least American movie history is full to overflowing with boxing films, i'll list some of my favourites:- Raging Bull(1980),Million Dollar Baby(2004),The Fighter(2010),Cinderella Man(2005),Body And Soul(1947),Champion(1949),Kid Galahad(1962 Elvis Presley musical)and The Champion(1915 Brilliant comedy by Charlie Chaplin) Another list of boxing films that i merely enjoyed very much would include Rocky(1976) Rocky 2&3(1979/1982) And The Champ(1979) but i could include a dozen more very very easily. A Third list of accomplished if third raters if only by sheer weight of numbers would include Southpaw. The thing with this movie is that we have seen everything, the shooting apart so many times before. The fall from grace, the recovery, the inspiring trainer, the do it for the kid angle is straight out of The Champ from way back from 1931, so there is almost nothing new. The main problem with the movie is the running time the film in the second half is rushed like many films these days it really needed more time another 30 minutes maybe even an hour to make the recovery more meaningful. All that said, Jake Gyllenhaal is once again utterly brilliant as Billy Hope the boxer from the gutter in film after film he is sheer brilliance personified see Nightcrawler(2014)for an recent example. Southpaw's director Antoine Fuqua and his camera and sound crew do a stunning job of the actual fight scenes the noble art of self defence is a bone crushing brutal and bloody business and business it is, here in this film. The violence is all up close and very personal and right in your face. Crunch and thump. But, the trouble is all with the back story. So i can only place it about number 17 over all among the 50 best boxing films i have seen, very good but not truly great. Movie history and time will in the end decide!"
"rockreviews6","7","0","2","1 August 2015"," Despite very strong performances and good direction it doesn't quite hit the mark.
","Let me first get this out there I was really looking forward to this film. Jake Gyllenhaall is actually my favorite actor so if he's in a project I'm pretty much immediately interested. With the talent involved I wanted the film to be great and in my opinion it's good but to say good is disappointing and I had issues with the film that I'll get to.<br/><br/>My favorite thing by far about the thing and what I was expecting to be best about it was the acting. Gyllenhaal gives a really solid performance and I could tell while I was watching it that he has prepared immensely for the film. well for the role. Forest Whittaker proves how much talent he has and he's very good here as Gyllenhaal's character's trainer. Rachael McAddams is also good in it as Gyllenhaall character's wife and her and Gyllenhaal had great chemistry.<br/><br/>However my main problem with Southpaw is that the events happen WAY too quick. For me they didn't explain enough some of the things that Gyllenhaal went through. I sort of get why they didn't want to go for that as to be fair the film is more of a boxing film than a character study.<br/><br/>As far as the clichés go I don't mind if they're in a film if they are done in a good style and here they are done OK. But I think that a problem with boxing films is that there's a very good chance that they will have them because boxing films henge to Rocky.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua directs the film well and I like how he shows how Billy slowly sees how everything crumbles down and he showed it in a way that worked well for the film.<br/><br/>On a side note do not watch the trailer if you are thinking about going to see the film because they practically spoil the plot.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Southpaw is a slight disappointment for me but to be completely honest I'm glad that it is at least a good film. It's worth seeing for the acting alone and I can say that it's worth seeing despite not being as good as it could have been."

","Is it Jake's rippling muscles, the pugilistic action, the drama? Of course, all of these ingredients make Southpaw a great watch, but above all----above the performances, above the inside-the- ring-action----it's the effort that Fuqua has put, the intention with which he has made this concoction-----a beautiful blend of drama, action, laudable performances. May also disappoint a lot of those who expected gut wrenching ""Rocky-Styled-Glamourized"" punches blown from both the sides. May overwhelm who were in for a real, actual boxing you would see in a real boxing match. This intense drama is all about ""transformation"" one goes through willingly sometimes or sometimes out of the kind of circumstances that surround. The way the protagonist realizes the value of keeping the desire of feeding the flesh aside, and learns to do things essential for his game is so real that it leaves one thinking, ""man, what the hell we get ourselves into and doom ourselves"". It's a masterpiece that Fuqua has delivered. Critics may say things they gotta say, but this is, long-story-short, REAL GOOD CINEMA. Jake Gyllenhall has performed every bit like an established Hollywood superstar, that he is----""Mind Blowing Performance""."
"FilmMuscle","7","0","2","29 July 2015"," Gyllenhaal Does Most of the Punching
","Actors, studying how to make the most out of their careers, need only look at Jake Gyllenhaal's brilliant role-selecting strategies. Last year, he completely freaked us out as an emaciated, bug-eyed nightcrawler. Fast forward eight months later, and he's suddenly a burly furious boxer with an incredible eight-pack. The man seems to be challenging himself past intensity as a thespian, putting him on the same track as Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Joaquin Phoenix in terms of sheer range. Antoine Fuqua's Southpaw gives us a gut- wrenching look into champion boxer Billy Hope's life–a man who seems to be living the American Dream, displaying pure ferocity in the ring and taking hard punches to the face like an unfazed rock only to deliver the final blow. Every night, he comes back to a stupendous mansion and to a beautiful wife and kid (poignantly played by Rachel McAdams and Oona Laurence)until all the walls around him start crumbling.<br/><br/>As a moviegoer who entered the theater expecting a Rocky-like sports drama, I was pleasantly surprised by the immediate dark turn the movie takes. All of a sudden, gunshots are ringing, and Billy is slipping a hood over his head with a silver firearm tucked into his pants and his face convulsing with unalloyed fury. In Nightcrawler, Gyllenhaal was this absolute Machiavellian, deliberating his every move and knowing where each piece fits. In Southpaw, he's taken one too many punches to the skull and is absolutely clueless in his current state of circumstances, unable to direct his own life without the help of his wife, Maureen. A blatant lack of intelligence and an undisciplined lifestyle is more or less sending him down the opposite path from Lou Bloom. It's through yet another undeniably powerful performance though that we feel the utmost pity and sympathy for the once-celebrated Billy Hope as the luxurious carpet is swept from under his feet.<br/><br/>Fuqua's very urban and gritty visual style is a perfect fit for this subject matter, capturing the boxing scenes with the greatest level of authenticity. Gyllenhaal, himself, rigorously trained in the gym for many months so that he could fully sink into this boxer's skin rather than allow a stunt double to take the glory, which beautifully translates into what looks like just another HBO PPV fight. With sweat spraying and blood spurting in slow motion, everything makes us feel tense while the visceral energy on the screen is clearly pulsating. At times, the ferocious pummeling is even shot in first-person as the audience sees monstrous fists/gloves flying at the screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's in the second hour where little can be done to add any freshness into the plot, and thus all the innovative effort is concentrated in the pivotal boxing segments. In those moments, Fuqua and cinematographer Mauro Fiore utilize the coolest angles and camera techniques in order to dramatically convey to the fullest extent how this man really is fighting for his livelihood. Again—when it comes to its narrative—as soon as the film reaches the second hour, Southpaw apparently has no other tricks up its sleeve and consequently reverts to the old sports-drama formula that has been recycled for decades since Rocky's thunderous release. Critic Scott Tobias said it best on the Filmspotting podcast: ""it's a Rocky movie that thinks it's Raging Bull.""<br/><br/>Suddenly, its edginess begins to subside at a rapid rate and so does Billy Hope's savagely aggressive, anti-hero temperament. Essentially, it transitions from an initial hour of gripping unpredictability and emotional turmoil to a second hour of wild predictability and banality. Hope's redemptive arc is sharply evident at that point. And this is exactly what frustrates me about the sports movie genre in general: there's very little room for original storytelling anymore. There's only so much you can do in this limited space: either the underdog wins or loses in the end. (The only sports films I hold dear are Raging Bull, Moneyball, Foxcatcher, and of course, Rocky.) It's okay though; even when the story dulls and loses its flare, Gyllenhaal's impeccable vehemence is enough to keep us glued to the screen. Whenever he steps into that ring and the match commences, any Hollywood artificiality immediately wanes. There are no actors on-screen anymore; we're just witnessing two fighters swiftly jabbing one another."
"jadepietro","6","0","1","28 July 2015"," A Dumb Palooka of a Movie
","(Rating: ☆☆ ½ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>In brief: This film never lands its knock-out punch but it does go the distance.<br/><br/>GRADE: B-<br/><br/>Boxing is a grueling sport, but not as grueling as sitting through the unoriginal Southpaw, a cliché-ridden heavy-weight tale of a down-on-his-luck pugilist plugging away to make his life better. The characters are light-weight replicas of real-life people, but it's the actors, especially Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role, who punch up this film to make it a worthy contender. <br/><br/>Granted, there have been some real knockouts in the cinematic history of boxing movies (Raging Bull, The Fighter, Million Dollar Baby, the original Rocky). And there have also been some god-awful ones (The Main Event, Grudge Match, all the other Rocky sequels) Southpaw falls squarely in the midsection. It's strong when it stays within the ropes, but once it leaves the arena, it's hopelessly pretentious, utterly predictable, and so heavy-handed, even with its gloves on or off.<br/><br/>If you have seen the film's trailer (which reveals the entire movie), you know where the film is going before the count. It's The Champ revisited, but grittier, bloodier, and supposedly more realistic, except for its nonsensical story.<br/><br/>As our story begins, Billy Hope (geez!) has everything: a loving wife, an adorable daughter and a lucrative boxing career. He is a wonderful guy, a champion on top of the world until (gasp!) tragedy strikes. Literally, once the Great White Hope in the boxing world, Billy falls on some hard times (of course). His road to redemption won't be easy (of course), but he will fight tooth and nail to get back on top (of course).<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal's commitment to this part is impressive. He toned up and certainly looks like a down-on-his luck boxer who has seen the dark side too often. With his highly sculptured physique, rock-hard abs, and bruised and battered face, the actor earnestly tries to pump some life into this lifeless role. But, as written, Billy is so one-dimensional and never really amounts to a real character, more of a caricature that we have seen a zillion times in boxing movies. Blame the screenwriter, Kurt Sutter, not the actor. Rachel McAdams plays Mo, his tough but loving wife (complete with a New Yawk accent) and Oona Laurence is memorable as Leila, their daughter caught in Billy's downward spiral. Forest Whitaker adds some interest in his supporting role as Tick Willis, Billy's loyal manager and conscience. Moviegoers can revel in his few dramatic moments whenever he is on the screen. Rounding out the cast is 50 Cents as Jordan Mains, his money-hungry promoter and Miguel Gomez playing Magic Escobar, his villainous opponent. (Hey, what is it with these odd names anyway?)<br/><br/>While the dialog has an authentic grittiness, the plot becomes more and more absurd in its predictability, As multiple obstacles quickly begin to mount in the most of illogical ways against our hero, who should be renamed Billy Hopeless, the film starts to become a parody of itself. Director Antoine Fuqua doesn't help matters with his overt foreshadowing of events and his penchant for soap opera melodramatics. He stages the boxing scenes with lots of hand-held in-your-face close-ups and handles these sequences with some verve. But his vision of the human drama outside the ring is so labored and overdone. The manipulative ending offers no surprises and the overall result is a bit of a yawn. <br/><br/>Southpaw is a dumb palooka of a movie. Even before the first punch is thrown, the contrived plot and its superficial characters kayo the film. But Gyllenhaal's impassioned performance is reason enough to see this film."

","Southpaw reminds us that the pleasures of a genre film lie less in originality than in the quality of the performance of familiar elements. Being old-hat is a challenge not a disqualification.<br/><br/>The plot line is familiar: a boxer is a single father who fights back to regain his child, title, fortune and especially self-respect. He has to fight and win in the social arena as well as in the ring. In Red Skelton's The Clown the dad was a — spoiler alert — clown not a fighter but in The Champ he's a fighter not a clown. Different jobs, same story. Different make-up, same emotions.<br/><br/>However familiar the plot, characters, even speeches, this film still packs a punch. Credit the strong supporting cast, especially Forest Whitaker as the second trainer, Rachel McAdams as the winning doomed wife and especially Oona Lawrence as the tough but needy little daughter. Of course, Jake Gyllenhaal is no mug in the leading role. He persuades us both with his rage and his vulnerability. Odd the film wasn't called Raging Poppa. <br/><br/>The fight scenes are almost in the same heavyweight class as Scorsese's incomparable Raging Bull. Much of the film's dramatic and emotional wallop comes from the crimson clashes, shot in intense closeup with sharp jabbing cuts and our disorientation matching the fighters'. The plot pours the violence out of the ring into the extra-arena showbiz, where another fight causes the wife's death. <br/><br/>Billy Hope's redemption lies in his overcoming his rage and emotional excess. He needs to do that to get back custody of his daughter. He also has to harness his anger to win the climactic fight. He almost loses it — and also the fight — when he lets his opponent's marital taunt enflame him. <br/><br/>But he recovers and wins on the strength of his change not just in character but in tactic. First, his new coach trains him to block punches instead of absorbing them in his version of Ali's rope-a-dope. He also cultivates his surprising left hook — hence the choice of title. Going southpaw is a metaphor for Billy Hope's radical change of character that redeems him. <br/><br/>Billy (nee William) toughens his Will to succeed in his Hope, to recover his family. This is prefigured when he has his daughter spell 'dismantle' and 'hopelessness.' Billy recovers his Hope by dismantling his old character and developing a new strong reach. That's the new wine this film pours out of the old bottle, its genre source.<br/><br/>The film's full use of scantily-clad ring-number beauties leads to another theory. Why are male-centered sports, like basketball, football, and especially boxing, always accompanied by sexy broads? There's an erotic element in watching impressive male specimens groping each other and joining in emotional violence, especially when they're stripped down as in basketball and boxing. (Hockey doesn't count here.) The spectacle therefore provides exposed beautiful women to provide a hetero relief — and perhaps save us from acknowledging the homoerotic potential in macho sports. That's why in bromances — whether Starsky and Hutch, Butch and Sundance, even down to the Ted flicks — one guy always has a girlfriend. Not that there's anything wrong with that."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Is it possible to have a boxing movie without a crusty old trainer? Or a cute kid? Or a stubborn macho lead who makes poor personal choices? It doesn't seem to matter much as this latest from director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) checks off most of the expected cliché's, and still slides easily into the canon of boxing movies that now covers nine decades.<br/><br/>This one packs a satisfactory punch both inside the ring and out. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Billy Hope (the name courtesy of first time screenwriter Kurt Sutter, known for ""Sons of Anarchy""). Mr. Hope follows the expected arc: 1. On top of the World! 2. A nasty crash landing 3. Redemption and comeback. However, just because we are familiar with the trail, doesn't mean we can't enjoy the hike.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal continues his impressive string of performances that include End of Watch, Prisoners, and Nightcrawler. In the latter, he transformed his body by losing 40 pounds. This time, he packs on the muscle to become convincing as a boxer. The recent trend of actors getting fat, skinny, ripped or ugly to attract awards attention is nothing new to Gyllenhaal, who has made a career of melding into his roles.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Rachel McAdams as Hope's wife. The two share a background as orphans in Hell's Kitchen and have a strong relationship with each other and their young daughter played by Oona Laurence. Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson plays Hope's long-time manager who telegraphs his true colors much too early (and no, this doesn't refer to the recent news involving Mr. Jackson). Naomie Harris is a bit underutilized as the social worker, but the film is at its best once Forest Whitaker enters as Hope's last hope (sorry). Mr. Whitaker always elevates a film with his presence, and his character here would have provided a boost with even more screen time.<br/><br/>A few topics are touched upon, though none very deeply. The father-daughter story line was pretty effective, but the anger management issue could have been explored more effectively since it was so crucial to the story and Hope's personality.<br/><br/>Eminem provides some new music for the film, and it should be noted that this was the final score composed by the great James Horner, who only recently passed away. Sure the film ""borrows"" from Rocky and Raging Bull and many other boxing classics, but at least it doesn't go full ""Champ"" on us."
