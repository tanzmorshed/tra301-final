"liso1966","7","69","83","22 November 2011"," Cliché, predictable, but so honest and funny!
","This movie was all things cliché and predictable. Even though you know what is coming, the honesty with life's little quirks and human behavior was incredibly well done. <br/><br/>Timberlake is an okay actor. I found him to be a fresh breath in this movie. The dialogue and scenario fit his charm quite well. <br/><br/>I found Mila Kunis to be quite funny, and she pulled off that cute, charming, awkwardly damaged woman, perfectly. She was chic, yet easy to relate too. Down to earth, but an air of success and confidence, hidden in all the girly dreams and fairy-tales. <br/><br/>If you want something original and never done before, this is the wrong movie to watch. If you wish to appreciate a good spin on an old concept with stellar humor and humanity, it is worth the watch.."

","I was able to see a sneak screening of this movie almost 1 month prior to it's official release. I honestly walked in simply thinking I was seeing another typical romantic comedy with my girlfriend. To my surprise it was much more.<br/><br/>Timberlake plays an LA Blog Art Director who has just been recruited to work for GQ in New York by Kunis who is a headhunter. The two had great chemistry through out the movie.<br/><br/>What's funny is that even though it does contain the usual Cliché scenes that most romantic adult comedies contain, it does tend to poke fun at them and have some sort of realism to the plot.<br/><br/>Both Timberlake and Kunis are likable and really funny. Woody Harrelson was the best addition to support this younger cast. Harrelson plays a flamboyantly gay sports editor who goes from making sexual advances to JT, to offering him some pearls of wisdom with his love life.<br/><br/>I would have to say this movie was very enjoyable and if your skeptical about seeing it in the theaters, definitely put it on your ""must rent"" list."

","I was expecting to have to compare this movie with No Strings Attached (or whatever that movie with Ashton Kutcher was) all the way through however I was pleasantly surprised that the story was a bit more complex despite the obvious parallels.<br/><br/>Yes it's the typical ""boy and girl decide to be friends only but end up loving each other"" movie .... but I must admit that it was a lot smarter in the delivery. Timberlake and Kunis have a lot of chemistry on camera ... It's shot primarily in new york so expect the clichéd new york locations ... <br/><br/>The complexity of Timberlake's character is slowly revealed through the show as opposed to being revealed in the first 3 minutes like most other movies.<br/><br/>A good watch ... not slap your knee funny but certainly entertaining to the end ... clichés and all"
"jonathanruano","7","32","42","7 April 2012"," ""Friends with Benefits""
","""Friends with Benefits"" has a predictable and unoriginal rom-com storyline and its ending is pretty lame. Yet this movie coasts on the charisma of Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis and a lot of sharp and witty dialogue. As long as these two actors are talking to each other or having sex, there is hardly ever a dull moment. And the reason for this seems to be simple enough. In most rom-coms, the actors play pretty dim-witted, boring and superficial people and therefore there is no reason to take interest in anything they may say or do. In this rom-com, ""Friends with Benefits,"" Timberlake and Kunis play fresh, independent and smart people and for this reason we are interested in the lives they lead and what they say to each other. So ""Friends with Benefits"" does not have much of a plot, but that does seem to matter because on this rare occasion we are happily distracted by the magnetism of two capable on screen actors who are playing two well-craft parts."
"Samiam3","6","79","117","22 July 2011"," A sweet satire that's almost good (but not quite)
","What I can say for Friends with Benefits is that it's a cute movie that doesn't reach it's full potential. The main problem to me is that when it starts, the film is being played as satire and when it ends, it's being played straight. As a result, Friends with Benefits does not quite rise above the romantic material it mocks, but on occasion it's funny and adorable.<br/><br/>Actually for a while, the movie is on fire. The opening is cleverly handled, and is a good way to grab the audiences attention. Then for the next several scenes, Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake demonstrate charm, comfort and overall competence and end up delivering a couple of the funniest sexual encounters I've seen in years. What I like about them both is that they bring enthusiasm to whatever they do, and this film is no exception.<br/><br/>Around the halfway point, the film starts to feel a little boring. with a running time of just over a hundred minutes, Friends with Benefits is not a long movie, and while it's not exactly short either, it feels shorter than it should be. There are a few hints to suggest that a longer movie was intended but the Studio may have forced a cut down. In addition to an ending that feels rushed, all the supporting characters in the story seem futile, and underwritten. Woody Harrelsson, for example, can be a really funny guy, but he's not given the material or the screen time, to make his appearance worthwhile.<br/><br/>The film has it's ups, it has it's downs. It doesn't end up being a bad Rom-com, but I've seen better."
"DonFishies","7","79","128","5 July 2011"," A raunchy sex comedy that starts off sweet but becomes sour all too quickly
","I was unsure what to expect going into Friends with Benefits at an advanced screening a few weeks ago. It always seemed a bit too close in plot to No Strings Attached (made extra odd as the female leads Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman had literally just starred together in Black Swan), a film that came out less than six months ago, and while the trailers looked amusing, they seemed to look a little too close to an atypical romantic comedy. But the film actually ended up surprising me. Well, the first half at least.<br/><br/>Jamie (Kunis) is a headhunter in New York City who helps aspiring graphic design artist Dylan (Justin Timberlake) land a prestigious job at GQ. They become good friends, and after a discussion about their relationship failures, decide to start having sex without the relationship schmaltz (hence the titular phrase). But the good times cannot stay uncomplicated for long.<br/><br/>Rather surprisingly, the first half of Friends with Benefits is a ridiculously raunchy sex comedy that is sweeter than it is crude. The dialogue and one-liners drop at a steady pace, and there is plenty of laugh out loud moments. I was genuinely surprised at just how much I was enjoying the film, and how well co-writer/director Will Gluck (who knocked Easy A out of the park last year) helped capture the tropes and stereotypes of romantic comedies, and went entirely against them. The scene that starts the initial sexual antics is a complete dissection of the genre, and seeing the film twist and turn around the familiar plot devices was wonderful to see. It made the film feel hilarious, but also made it feel like it was attempting to do something different at the same time. Adding in a couple of random cameos from notable actors was a bit wacky (which the trailers have ruined slightly), but helped add to the humour.<br/><br/>Except the film comes to a screeching halt just about halfway in when Jamie and Dylan come to the all too obvious realization that they may want something more. The film then becomes drastically more dramatic, a lot less sweet, and significantly more ordinary. Even the laughs suffer, landing less with a snicker and more with a groan. Everything it does to shift itself away from the romantic comedy genre feels wasted because it falls into all of the stereotypes quicker than it poked fun at them. It almost feels like they wanted to desperately feel different, and then decided to just go the safer route as opposed to sticking with its offbeat early tactics. I was really enjoying the film significantly more than I imagined, but suddenly felt bored and totally thrown off by the drastic tonal shift.<br/><br/>While sketch comedy has proved to be one of his strong suits, Timberlake seems to have a lot of trouble carrying the film. We know he has the chops to command the screen and be absolutely magnetic (we have David Fincher and The Social Network to thank for that), but here he seems to be struggling with every other scene. He lands most of his jokes well, does decently with the dramatic bits and has plenty of chemistry with Kunis, but he lacks the spark I think most people will expect him to have in this role. He comes off as just okay, and more amateur than anything else. He would have been better suited in the film as a key supporting player, as opposed to the lead.<br/><br/>Kunis on the other hand, is significantly stronger and proves that her turn in Forgetting Sarah Marshall may have been an early suggestion of the formidable comedic talent she may quickly become. Gluck is not able to achieve the same level of breakthrough that he got from Emma Stone in Easy A from Kunis, but she manages to carry the film almost single handedly. Even at the script's weakest moments, she grins and pushes forward, never once appearing to be struggling as much as Timberlake does. I think my only complaint against her is that she spends a good portion of the film completely nude, yet ends up wearing all too obvious pasties under a white shirt in one scene. It seems more like a complaint against a horrendously bad editing and lighting decision than against her, but it was a scene that made her seemingly-realistic character feel a whole lot less believable.<br/><br/>Patricia Clarkson and Richard Jenkins both deliver good performances, but sadly feel like they are just plagiarizing from characters they have played better in the past. Jenna Elfman (who I did not realize was still acting) does a little better in a warm and significantly low-key role as Dylan's sister Annie. But it is Woody Harrelson who steals the entire show as gay sports writer Tommy. He plays the character ridiculously over-the-top, but never feels like he is encroaching on any stereotypes. He makes it his own, and is almost too good in the role. He gets all of the film's best dialogue quips, and runs circles around everyone on screen. In more than one instance, Timberlake looks legitimately shocked at some of the things Harrelson says and gets away with. I think the film could have only benefited from including more of him.<br/><br/>In the end, Friends with Benefits is both surprisingly well done and unsurprisingly ordinary. It tries so hard initially to be the anti- romantic comedy, and then just ends up falling into the same predictable elements that every other film in the genre has already done countless times before. The film is genuinely hilarious when it wants to be however, and this does save it from being a total waste. But it could have been so much more.<br/><br/>7/10."
"DICK STEEL","Null","26","40","1 October 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Friends with Benefits
","2011 will probably go down as the year Hollywood tells us having F* buddies is OK and encouraged, with no less than three films this year set around the premise of pure sex without strings or emotions attached, with Love and Other Drugs and No Strings Attached setting the precedence earlier with an incredibly good looking cast in all sorts of undress - Anne Hathaway, Jake Gyllenhaal, Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher - and added to the list will be current IT guy and girl Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis rolling beneath the sheets in a typical love story between the emotionally unavailable and the emotionally damaged.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis stars as Jamie, a headhunter in New York who persuades her target Dylan played by Justin Timberlake to ditch his young, upstart blogging team to join GQ (how's that for a little bit of subtle advertising) in revamping its website and to infuse new content ideas. A night out prior to the offer seals the LA based Dylan to relocate and take up the offer, with plenty of activities thrown in that if it's not Jamie being his only friend in a new, big city, they would serve as activities that would fit in for an awesome date night out. Before long they become firm friends, and made a pact to keep things physical since they each have their wants, and with the other party game to get down and dirty, so begins their game of tennis (though personally I prefer analogy with, and the term ""bedminton"" - it involves cocks after all). After all, why complicate what would be a beautiful friendship, if sex can be treated just as sex without the emotions thrown in to mess things up?<br/><br/>You know the clichéd drill by now, with things moving along fine and dandy, the hint of emotions coming into play to really turn things upside down, the narrative montage to show how frequent they mate like jackrabbits, before some large, needy episode or statements uttered that will probably reveal the true state of affairs, and the list goes on. Deny all you want, but one cannot help but to agree that the fairer sex will have things rough if pacts of this nature turn sour, and expectedly in a movie they always do, otherwise everyone will be happy without adversary, frustration and challenges to overcome and provide that change in strength of character.<br/><br/>And it is this power of the cliché that absolutely calls the shots in films like these. You know what will happen, but want to see them happen anyway even though you're multiple steps ahead of every character. And it is precisely these expectations that anyone would want to see covered, and try as the filmmakers want it is the clichés that they find hard to break away from, even if characters here proclaim very early on that romance in their world shouldn't be like an unbelievable Hollywood film, but in what would be art imitating art, look who's talking to begin with. And what's with the fixation about consistently taking the shine off the captain of US Airways Flight 1549 in its emergency landing onto the Hudson River?<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake is fast becoming the busy bona fide movie star since The Social Network, and continues his run with this film and In Time which will hit the screens here soon. He has that boyish charm that the camera just loves, and being a real life singer meant covering a number of songs here, from Stereophonics to Kris Kross made it look all too easy. Mila Kunis plays her role as the emotionally damaged girl with aplomb, and shares an effective chemistry with Timberlake that makes this film a delight to sit through, even if as mentioned the story's cliché and we know just about how these two nice looking people will likely get together. <br/><br/>The supporting characters while one dimensional almost always threaten to steal the show, from Patricia Clarkson as Jamie's sex crazed mom extending the lifespan of a running joke involving the nationality of Jamie's unseen dad, Woody Harrelson as the gay colleague of Dylan who always have innuendos offhand to share, Jenna Elfman who plays Dylan's sister and Richard Jenkins starring as Dylan's dad who's suffering from advancing Alzheimer's disease, which is especially poignant as it deals with the subplot of how a family copes with a loved one who's behaviour develops erratically, and holding the key to a pivotal personal experience to share and turn things around.<br/><br/>With Andy Samberg and Emma Stone making cameos (the latter being extremely crazy as a fanatical John Meyer fan), Friends With Benefits has its main leads to thank for in milking quite the cliché story for the masses, who are likely to make a beeline just to see those two in some down and dirty action, not that you get to see a lot to begin with anyway. Recommended, and stay tuned until after the end credits roll for more commentary when the two are sitting at a couch watching the outtakes of a DVD movie."

","Friends with Benefits is a good movie with a pretty well developed storyline and a fantastic comedic cast.I thought this would be exactly like No Strings Attached,and I really hated that movie so I wasn't going to bother watching this,but my friends told me it was much different and better,and while I didn't believe them I gave this a chance and I'm happy I did,it is much better and it isn't similar at all to No Strings Attached other than the set up of two friends having casual relations.I cared about these characters a lot and wanted them to get together,there was really great chemistry between Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake,and there are also hilarious cameos from great comedy actors such as Woody Harrelson,Andy Samberg.Emma Stone,Rashida Jones,Jason Segel,among others.My favourite part of the movie was Richard Jenkins,he delivered a great performance and the emotional addition of him struggling with Alzheimer's was a good idea and very sweet,I cared about him more than anyone else.It isn't anything outstanding,but it's funny and certainly a better than usual romantic comedy that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good one. <br/><br/>Two friends who despise romance decide to add a bit of love making to their friendship without any complications.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Richard Jenkins Worst Performance: Patricia Clarkson"
"holyspiritdriven","1","32","56","16 January 2012"," Nothing New
","I don't know what I expected from this packaged pre-frabricated Hollywood blockbuster so why did I feel like I wasted my $1.29 at Redbox (actually twice that for accidentally keeping the movie 2 nights). From the beginning, the dialogue was so full of quips and witty banter that the characters were never believable. The plot is basically the writer living out a fantasy of ""no strings attached"" sex which is a joke in real life because it's not how humans are made. In the movie, instead of learning that ""no love sex"" is impossible, the characters just decide they really do like each other (I'm not even going dilute the word ""love"" by using it here). The movie then proceeds to predictably fall into the romantic comedy trap that it made fun of in the beginning. Beside many personal annoyances (like Hollywood producers & writers always making movies about or based in New York or L.A. because they are ignorant as to any kind of life outside of those cities), I am beyond sick of movies diluting the beauty of sex by pushing the boundaries and tiptoeing on the line of pornography. This movie offers nothing more than the eye candy of Mila Kunis. If I were you I would not waste a Redbox dollar on it."
"hthbrr2","1","26","45","24 December 2011"," Just like No Strings Attached but slightly different and still horrible.
","Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>So when I first heard of this movie I got REALLY confused. Because a movie JUST LIKE THIS was JUST released it was called No Strings Attached. Wow it's official: Hollywood HAS RUN OUT OF IDEAS! They are so shameless about it now even. They don't even try to space them apart anymore to try and trick people! Like the Hulk reboots. At least they had YEARS separation. And people found THAT outrageous! These movies came out back to back! Here let me list the similarities between these two movies:<br/><br/>Both have the same plot: a male and female agree to be ""fu(& buddies"" <br/><br/>Both end up the same way: the male and female end up wanting more <br/><br/>Both have an actress that was in Black Swan; NSA: Natalie Portman FwB: Mila Kunis <br/><br/>Both have the male lead that was more famous in the 90's; NSA: Ashton Kutcher (That 70's Show actor) FwB: Justin Timberlake (N*sync singer) <br/><br/>Both have outrageous, BETTER, more interesting supporting actors/characters; NSA: the girl with the glasses FwB: Justin's gay friend. <br/><br/>Both have these people be at the top of their game and rich! NSA: the girl is a doctor and the guy I forgot but he was pretty well off FwB: The girl has a cushy job, and the guy is getting money thrown at him!<br/><br/>This last similarity brings me to my next point; the movie was unrealistic. This movie is taking place in a post-recession world. There are flash mobs, new technology, references to current things. YET in this movie companies are BEGGING people to work for them!? WTF!? THERE ARE NO JOBS! This was the MOST INSULTING DISGUSTING THING about this piece of (r@p movie! They will hire some #0re to FLY to LA to CONVINCE a guy WITH HIS OWN company to work for them. Doesn't that mean that they have to pay him more? It's for GQ magazine sure, but a mag has THAT much money!? And for what!? This guy does not even do his job! Knows nothing as proved by his gay friends question's like ""What font did you use?"" This guys 'brilliant' response; ""I don't know. Times new roman?"" Most of the time he is fooling around with the girl and doing other random $#!t!!!! It disgusts me that Hollywood does not get it! Life is not a fairy tale! People don't and CAN'T live these lives. That apartment Justin's character can supposedly afford (IN NEW YORK NO LESS!) even the rich struggle to get! WOW!<br/><br/>The only difference between these movies is the person that wants their relationship to mean more. In NSA it's the guy that wants more and the girl that doesn't ""get it."" In FwB it's the girl that wants more and the guy does not ""get it.""<br/><br/>Also I hated how this movie tried to be so hipster. Like it was trying to be so ""cool."" As if they were ""better than"" these movies they were making fun of. At this point pretty much ANY other romantic comedy is better than this piece of crap! Even NSA had the girl with the glasses - so funny! While this movie's stand out character; the gay friend, was barely even in the movie! Also the ending was a cop out they did not admit that they were wrong! Cynical to the end! Wow what idiots, what a pointless movie!"
"SteveMierzejewski","Null","49","95","7 September 2011"," A movie without benefits
","Don't waste your time on this one. A weak, predictable plot highly dependent on simulated sex scenes between the two main characters to maintain viewer interest. Of course, if you're into that kind of thing, you'd probably think this was the movie of the year. If you're looking for some depth or acting quality, you've come to the wrong film.<br/><br/>And what's with Justin Timberlake? Is he gay or putting a little too much glitter on his speech to give it a gay twist? I'm not trying to be funny here because one of the running gags is that people keep asking him if he is gay. I suppose this is supposed to have us all convulsed with laughter, otherwise I don't have any idea why they are beating us to death with this angle. I suspect Mila Kunis did her best with the underdeveloped character she was given, and its the reason I rated the film so highly. Anyway, if you really want to explore the 'can men and women be friends' theme, watch the best in this genre, 'When Harry Met Sally'. At least you won't regret the time you spent watching it."

","So is Friends With Benefits better than No Strings Attached? Yes. And if that's all you needed to settle a bet with your friend, you can go call him up now and plan a trip to the theater July 22 to find out why.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake has proved once again that he can actually act... Pretty well, actually. And that automatically puts him lightyears ahead of Ashton Kutcher. Additionally, Justin and Mila have some excellent and convincing chemistry that really supports the film, along with a handful of jokes and hilarious cameos that make for some good laughs. But the story falls flat where it tries to parody the typical romance movie because ultimately, it adheres to the exact same chick-flick formula: Guy meets girl, they hit it off, complications arise, they fall apart, they resolve their issues, and voilà... happily ever after. And Mila's mother in the movie... where have we seen her character before? Oh that's right, literally copy+pasted from Easy A. <br/><br/>I suppose you probably wouldn't expect anything more out of this movie than the run-of-the-mill romance comedy, but it's a solid one at that and worth your while if you're interested! <br/><br/>7/10"
"dbrando","1","35","69","29 July 2011"," A film with nothing
","Friends with Benefits seems like it might be a satire of Nora Ehpron's feel good films,or Neil Simon's one dimensional types with just TV cracks as substitutes for any kind of genuine dialogue. Not the case here. This film makes Ephron's screenplays and directed films, along with N. Simon's stuff, look like classics. Friends with Benefits has no acting in it, except for Patricia Clarkson, and she is debased as one of those old women- mothers who swear and screw around with men etc.<br/><br/>There isn't one line that is funny,there is not a scene between Timberlake and Kunis that has any chemistry to it. He is always seen as potentially gay, and Woody Harrelson's gay character keeps us wondering, if anyone would care to wonder.<br/><br/>Timberlake plays it all as sort of gay and sort of straight, but comes up neuter. I think the reason why there are so many nude shots of him is because you never take his gender seriously, like one of the dwarfs in Snow White, you never fear for Snow White's sexual safety; the dwarfs have nothing that would cause fear. So it is with Timberlake. Even when there is sex between Kunis and Timberlake, it looks like wrestling at summer camp.<br/><br/>The Altzheimer scenes are appalling, along with the gay male model scenes that are deeply homophobic.<br/><br/>This film needed a script, director, producer, and stars, not non-actors, who stomp around the set with no sense of mimesis, mimicking at all.<br/><br/>Avoid this, and watch ""The Nanny."""
"herbqedi","2","15","26","27 December 2011"," Actors talk at people, not to them
","This is the movie for the video generation - all flash mobs and photography. Some very good actors (Emma Stone, Patricia Clarkson, and Richard Jenkins) do their best with clichéd caricature actors (the shrewish ex-girlfriend, the lost-in-the-70's mom; and the father with Alzheimiers with a propensity for taking his pants off. Only Jenna Elfman as Timberlake's sister comes off as an actual human being. Woody Harrelson is horribly one-note as the obsessively gay sports Editor but it's okay because he's hip. This movie tries to be as hip as it can be by pretending to be a spoof on Hollywood Romantic comedies while actually making one. But, it's not really a romantic comedy at all despite the tacked-on cliché ending. It's really vulgar.<br/><br/>They talk at each other saying inappropriate things and never listening to each other. Both are gorgeous - I'll give them that. But, that's just about all. Their love-making sessions include some crude exchanges and interludes with Timberlake's slapstick routing about a male situation making it too hard to urinate normally chewing up about 4 minutes of film time. I've seen some reviews saying that the two leads had great chemistry. As far as I could tell the two were filmed separately, then spliced together. In a similarly themed movie, Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman had 100 times the chemistry these two did. Of course, Portman is a much more profound actress than the flippant Kunis (see Black Swan).<br/><br/>Okay, that's probably enough. I wasted nearly 2 hours of my life watching this so I need spend no more time on it now."

"dsa_ca","5","21","41","23 July 2011"," Friends with eventually regular Hollywood clichés
","There is a recurring adjective that is attached with Mila Kunis's character Jamie which is used by all her sex partners to their advantage i.e. she is emotionally damage. According to Justin Timberlake's character even Magnum P.I cannot solve the case of what's going through Jamie's head when she thinks relationships. What makes a person emotionally damaged is not really elaborated in the movie. She is raised by a single mother, but the quest to know who her father was, is more or less laughed off. While she breaks up with her relationship with Andy Sandberg, it seems she has enough admirers as Shaun White is shown as one of her secret admirer and she also has a passionate set of friends with whom she parties around. So what exactly is her state of being emotionally damaged related to? Or is it a statement that would help the director bring some complications with her friend that provides sexual benefits Justin Timberlake! That might be the case in this totally romantic comedy film.<br/><br/>The new romantic comedy 'Friends with benefits', which does not shy away from taking a shot at mocking at every romantic comedy clichés, more or less falls into trappings of the romantic genre from the beginning. Mila Kunis (Jamie), a corporate headhunter in New York, is just out of a relationship with SNL fame Andy Sandberg, while an upcoming blogger in Los Angeles, Justin Timberlake (Dylan) is also dealing with a break up with his girlfriend played by Emma Stone. When Jamie sets up an interview for Dylan at GQ magazine, he comes up in New York and meets Jamie for the first time at the airport. Right from the beginning Jamie performs all the cute stunts a romantic comedy female lead is expected to but also balances out by mocking Hollywood's take on romance and New York. Soon after Dylan moves into NY City to take up the job, Jamie gets him into her friends circle and they both start hanging out together watching Hollywood Romantic comedies and mocking it. But they both are missing sexual intimacy in their lives and since Jamie is emotionally damaged and Dylan claims to be emotionally unavailable they both decide to have just a sexual relationship without any emotions involved. <br/><br/>It's all fine and dandy till all the sex lasts for them and unfortunately for the audience as well. Once the sex dries up the movie just goes south and we are introduced to all the regular clichéd family characters. As Dylan takes Jamie to his home in Los Angeles for the 4th of July weekend, we are introduced to Dylan's good hearted elder sister Jenna Elfman (Annie) and her magic obsessed son Sam and more importantly Dylan's Alzheimer inflicted father Mr. Harper played earnestly by Richard Jenkins. The stories about Dylan's not so happy childhood is what eventually melts the heart of our emotionally damaged Jamie and they go on to have their first sexual encounter added with emotions. But these emotions are only noticed by the emotionally damaged girl, while emotionally unavailable boy clearly ignores and start off a chain reaction of complications in their friendship. So this is what is served as suspense romantic complications to our audience and since this is a pre-determined summer blockbuster the eye candy and emotionally hopeless couple have to get back together. How? Well with the usual Hollywood charm and pot full of cliché ridden sequences.<br/><br/>For a movie that mocked the romantic comedy genre at regular intervals during the first half of the movie, it was quiet an irony that it had to use more or less the clichés from that same genre to bring the movie around its eventual happy ending. And for all the dissing of Katherine Heigl by Mila Kunis, she is the new Ms. Heigl for romantic comedies. Easy on eyes with magnetic screen presence Ms. Kunis has the charm to breeze through the clichés of this particular genre of films. Justin Timberlake also provides an insight of what to expect in the future in his acting career as he also elegantly passes romantic comedy test.<br/><br/>As for the film, apart from the intimate relationship and scenes between Justin and Mila, it always seems to be hanging on extreme to carry some laughs. Woody Harrelson plays its Gay sports editor part with good amount of enthusiasm, but Patricia Clarkson as Mila's flirtatious sex obsessed mother just tries to be extreme and we should be thankful that few scenes from the promotional videos were edited out from the final reel. While there is another extreme moment between Justin and his wild date who tries to act as being wild in bed by licking and smelling Mr. Timberlake's armpit, which neither grosses out nor induces laughter but guarantees yawn from the audience.<br/><br/>To an audience who has seen it all in this year's romantic comedy hit 'No strings attached', which was also about friends 'hooking up' just for the pleasure of the whole act; Friends with benefit has nothing new or better to offer. It glides along on the charm of its two leads, but fails to hide its flaws as a good romantic comedy entertainer.<br/><br/>For more reviews visit http://cinemadose.blogspot.com/"

Do we really need to an explanation from Timberlake on why it's hard to urinate when a man is excited?<br/><br/>The film is replete with vulgarity's like this. It appears that rather than building on the film's few qualities, and it has a few, the producers decided to educate the opposite sex (whichever you happen to be) with crude innuendo on the other. It would appear they were trying to make the film interesting to 13 year old's. <br/><br/>This odd downplay to the audience in general goes hand in hand with the fact the film is simply a rehash of ""No Strings Attached"".<br/><br/>Mila Kunis, I expected better from you following, ""The Black Swan""<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake, I expected nothing from you following, ""Yogi Bear""."

","I was surprised to learn that this film was by the director of the engaging ""Easy A."" In ""Friends with Benefits,"" he elicits so-so performances from a wonderful cast as if it was his central purpose.<br/><br/>The script was written by three men, but sounds as if written by a middle-aged-plus lady a la the horrible Nancy Meyers, straining to seem ""daringly"" dirty, up-to-the-minute hip and fitfully ""meta."" There are plenty of references to movies and digital culture, but few laughs, and I never felt any human connection with the characters. The dialog is delivered in a pressured way, with each new line beginning at the instant the previous speaker finishes, with never a pause or overlap. The editor would usually cut at that instant, giving some scenes a very clunky rhythm, with consequent injury to any flow or naturalism.<br/><br/>FWB's scattered references to standard romcom memes don't seem so witty finally, given the script's failure to subvert or transcend them. Its would-be feel-good conclusion is unearned and false."

","Friends With Benefits is exactly like No Strings Attached. Except it isn't. The plot is the same, but the movie dynamics are totally different.<br/><br/>FWB was one of the funniest romantic comedies in years. No formula, no b.s., just good comedy.There were a lot of satirical elements in the movie that were surprisingly witty.<br/><br/>I'm not sure Woody Harrelson's character was actually needed to progress the story,but I'd equate it to Melissa McCarthy's character in Bridesmaids. Just really, really funny every time he's on screen.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the two main characters was very real most of the time. Both Timberlake and Kunis played off each other fairly well. And the rated R is what the adult viewer really wants. And trust me, FWB delivers.<br/><br/>Another thing FWB had that No Strings Attached didn't was a lot of heart. Very real emotions were often displayed in the movie.<br/><br/>There were some great cameos in the movie, like Jason Segel, Andy Samberg, Emma Stone, and Shaun White playing Shaun White. <br/><br/>Good for Will Gluck for making a good follow-up movie to Easy A. I think he's really starting to find his niche in Hollywood."

This movie didn't even have the bright side of good actors, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis may be easy on the eye but are mediocre actors at best, you only have to watch MK in Oz: The Great And Powerful to see what I mean.

","I was staying in on Saturday night and wanted to watch something light hearted and humorous. Friends with benefits seemed the perfect fit. Mila Kunis is usually talented and Justin Timberlake has done some good stuff. Add to it the glamour of NY and sharp comedy, things looked promising.<br/><br/>I lasted about 30 minutes. I don't know how they managed turn talent and sharp humour into something so annoying. Mila Kunis came across as a fake, arrogant brat and Justin Timberlake had about as much charm as a broom stick. I ended up just being irritated by a lot of things in the film. Such as when Mila Kunis asks Justing Timeberlake if he thinks she's pretty. This is Mila Kunis - voted the sexiest woman in the world for god sake. They both have glamorous jobs, look perfect and have perfect blend of humour and wit...just too damn perfect with absolutely no touch of reality. Not even a hint of chemistry between the two.<br/><br/>It's such a shame because Mila Kunis was excellent in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and her voice over work in Family Guy is brilliant. So I can only blame the director in this movie for turning her into such an annoying character. As for Justin Timberlake...bland, just bland.<br/><br/>Irritating film. Luckily, Predator was on and saved the evening. At least Arnie can do proper humour."
"napierslogs","2","16","35","31 October 2011"," Insulting romantic comedies, its fans, and everything else
","The thing about 'Friends with Benefits"" is that you have, in fact, seen it before. Not in the generic way the film implies that all romantic comedies are the same. But this exact movie was released earlier this year with the title ""No Strings Attached"". And what's worse is that vapid, uninspired, Hollywood-love-fest original is actually better.<br/><br/>Unashamedly, I admit that I like romantic comedies. I do get very upset when Hollywood makes stupid ones that I don't like it, but I still watch them. The problems here stem from the fact that ""Friends with Benefits"" is a romantic comedy but thinks that it isn't. One of the jokes that lasts the entire run-time of the movie is that romantic comedies suck and the people who watch them are fundamentally stupid. I don't like being insulted and I especially don't like being insulted by something that is trying to survive on put-downs and pretending to be better than the very genre they belong to.<br/><br/>There is a fake romantic comedy that plays during this movie, usually serving as fodder for insults, and allows the film to point out everything that is wrong with it. I don't think the filmmakers are so daft to not realize that they are doing the exact same things, but I do think they expected their audience to not pick up on it.<br/><br/>Recently Jason Segel has been doing the rounds promoting his new Muppets movie. One of the points he likes making is that the humour is pure and innocent; that the jokes don't insult or put-down anyone or anything. I like Segel as much as the next person, but it astounds me that he could be so hypocritical that just three months earlier he appeared in a movie where every joke insulted somebody or something.<br/><br/>And I do mean every joke. We start with John Mayer insults and the obligatory Katherine Heigl jokes, move on to standard romantic comedy insults, then come back with some out-of-place jokes making fun of the Hudson River-landing pilot, and on the way back to more romantic comedy insults, shoot off some remarks about Kriss Kross, '90s pop bands, and of course, homosexuals. And I likely forgot some.<br/><br/>Contrary to the current popular stance, I like Justin Timberlake. He has been in a lot of movies recently, and he's usually one of the best things in them. He also has no problem insulting himself. Surprisingly, the movie never took that path.<br/><br/>If for some reason, you're still watching, beware that ""Friends with Benefits"" probably has the highest product placement total in recent history. There's a reason Timberlake's character is a marketing exec at GQ – if they didn't make enough money at the box office, they would have off of their sponsors.<br/><br/>To be clear, ""Friends with Benefits"" is a romantic comedy. Girl is emotionally damaged, boy is emotionally unavailable. Girl falls for boy, boy falls for girl, but let's see how long before they both give in. If you don't like romantic comedies, then you won't like this. If you do like romantic comedies, then the filmmakers think you have a worthless opinion and you won't like it anyways. It is odd how that works out."
"Greatornot","2","17","38","14 August 2011"," Avoid this film like the plague
","I was actually embarrassed for the headline actors, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. The material was not good nor were the jokes. Justin Timberlake was bad enough to begin, as usual. Mila Kunis is normally better than this. I guess she was playing down to her material and co-star. Either way the acting was horrible as was the plot and the direction. A negative trifecta. If there were any redeeming factors to the film it was the supporting actors. All of which I felt did an excellent job with the material they had to work. Patricia Clarkson, Woody Harrelson, Richard Jenkins and even Jenna Elfman, respectively. The film was predictable which is OK in this genre. Just a sloppy project in every facet. Save your time and bypass this one."
"zardoz-13","Null","3","4","1 August 2011"," When Justin Met Mila . . .
","It is difficult to believe that talented ""Easy A"" writer & director Will Gluck had anything to do with this shallow as well as satiric romantic comedy about a loquacious couple who tumble in the sack but shun wearing their feelings on the their respective sleeves. You'd think that these youngsters were the first who preferred sex without sentiment. Each of these commitment-leery lovers has been through the wringer in a previous relationship that left them with nothing but bad vibes and the desire to never succumb so such sadness again. Sexy Mila Kunis plays a single but sexually active corporate headhunter named Jamie who recruits Los Angeles-based website editor Dylan (Justin Timberlake of ""The Social Network"") to be the new art director opening at GQ magazine. Predictably, not only does Dylan take this dream job, but he also bundles up with Jamie in bed in an R-rated movie that lacks both steam and momentum. You will find about as much meaningful nudity here as you might find in an issue of Maxim magazine. The entire plot revolves around their relationship after coitus and the ups and downs that they endure before Gluck and scenarists Keith Merryman and David A. Newman bring the leads full circle in Grand Central Station in the Big Apple. Just to add some sparkle to the shenanigans we are treated to Patricia Clarkson cast as the liberated mom of our heroine who raves about the 1970s and Woody Harrelson as Tommy an openly gay sports writer. ""Saturday Night Live"" fans will recognize Andy Samberg breaking up with Mila in an opening gambit while Emma Stone ditches Timberlake. Probably the slickest thing that Gluck pulls off is his surprising cross-cutting between the guys and the gals in this scene. Initially, we assume that Mila and Jamie are breaking up until we see that it is two couples. Richard Jenkins injects some heavy-handed gravitas as Jamie's Alzheimer's addled father who steals every scene in which he appears. Gluck tries his best (or worst) to skewer the conventions of romantic comedies, but he only winds up skewering himself. Mind you, Mila has some nice-looking skin and Justin has a washboard belly to die-for if you're into looking physically fit. Unfortunately, good looks, great chemistry, and rapid-fire dialogue delivery cannot overcome the one cliché after another. Altogether, if you have not seen ""When Harry Met Sally,"" watch ""When Harry Met Sally after you see ""Friends with Benefits."""

Way overboard with the sexual situations and language. Couple of narcissistic persons with a complete lack of morality try to hook up. You know every move before it happens. I wonder if they have run out of ideas in Hollywood. The background music was way too distracting. I wasn't sure if they were showing a movie or promoting a music CD.

"Smells_Like_Cheese","5","4","6","10 January 2012"," No benefit to watching it
","If you had read my comments you know my hatred for most romantic comedies, as they are the same formula over and over again with different names and actors. 2011 had a movie staring hot on the rise Natalie Portman called No Strings Attached. An intelligent romantic comedy about the realism on relationships, how sometimes there is no way to get around having feelings for someone in our busy world. We want that connection with someone and sometimes let it go before we realize that we may have lost someone special. So almost in taking her role too seriously, Mila Kunis who starred with Natalie Portman in Black Swan playing a girl who is almost a little jealous of the lead's talent, takes on the same like role. Playing the girl a small bit different by being someone who does believe in love but thinks that it's something wrong with her on why she can't find the right guy for her. Can Justin Timberlake prove her wrong? What could have been a very creative formula in making fun of how romantic comedies have taken over most women's perceptions of what love should be instead of what's reality, it turns back into the same tired old formula it's bashing in the first place.<br/><br/>Jamie has the task of trying to recruit Dylan to interview for a job with GQ magazine, he comes to New York and after interviewing for the position learns from Jamie that he has been given an offer to work for GQ. Not knowing anyone else in the city he and Jamie quickly develop a friendship. One night, while hanging out at Jamie's apartment watching a romantic comedy, they get on the topic of sex and relationships. They come to the conclusion that sex should not come with so many emotional attachments. Both feeling the need for a physical connection they agree to have sex without emotion or commitment involved. After several trysts together Jamie comes to the realization that this isn't really what she wants, and she would like to start dating again and informs Dylan that they need to stop. But after many failed attempts on both parts they are both in a supposed shock when they realize they really like each other.<br/><br/>You name it, the cliché is there: the gay best friend, the misunderstanding, the workaholics, the walking down the street to some cheesy sappy pop song looking into the sky wondering how a love could go so wrong, the talking to an old person making the protagonist realize how they were wrong and must do something so dramatic to win the person back and of course the big make up kiss in front of a big crowd of people who feel the need to applause despite the fact that they don't know what is going on. Despite a lot of flaws the thing I do give credit too is that Mila and Justin do have some great chemistry bouncing back and forth off each other. Although they are such beautiful people and it's hard to believe that they are that hard up for some loving. Would I say this is a terrible romantic comedy? Not necessarily, I didn't feel my time was totally wasted, but I would recommend No Strings Attached over this as that was more realistic and had a better feel to it. But I think this was over all a good way to waste some time if you're looking for light hearted fun as the two leading actors make it worth your while. It's just a tired old formula that I wish could have a different ending for once. But that isn't coming any time soon as Hollywood needs to stick with the safe formula of having everyone live happily ever after and nothing more after that.<br/><br/>5/10"

","This movie was absolutely horrendous. There was not a single positive aspect to this movie. First of all, it's not funny. Second of all, the acting is lousy. I understand that this is a romantic comedy and it's supposed to be a bit light and not so deep...but this was really bad. I mean, there really wasn't a single truthful moment in this movie from an acting perspective. I've seen children have more substance that Justin Timberlake and his female counterpart. Third of all, this movie was really awkward- like neither of these individuals have had sex in their life..... Fourth, the plot/story is literally non-existent--> we are literally forced to watch the first hour of the movie in this sort of trance-like mirage of weird images of Justin trying to be funny in bed with this chick....but all the audience could do is cringe in utter embarrassment at this fiasco.<br/><br/>Fifth, they kept trying to get Justin Timberlake naked--> but is he supposed to have a great body or something? I mean he looks like a highschool kid...what woman is salivating for the body of a highschooler? They should have been doing everything possible to keep his clothes on and not off. The list of flaws could go on for infinite....this movie blows. I give it an F.<br/><br/>The only thing that keeps this movie from being a 1 is Woody Harrelson who's awesome as usual.

","Another R-rated comedy? Come on, right? <br/><br/>Okay, even though this summer has seen the release of a litter of R- rated pups, including Horrible Bosses and Bridesmaids, there's definitely room for WIll Gluck's fast paced effort, Friends with Benefits. <br/><br/>Beyond the obvious similarities to No Strings Attached, the barely watchable rom-com that left everyone wondering how the hell Natalie Portman came off as less charismatic than Ashton Kutcher, Friends With Benefits is a sharp and satirical look at the modern landscape of romantic comedies.<br/><br/>A comparison to Scream isn't exactly off the mark here, as many of the same self-aware elements that worked in Scream work for Friends With Benefits. There are obvious breaks of the fourth wall when the rom-com clichés are checked off the list, but Friends With Benefits knows what it is, a romantic comedy, and a fun one at that.<br/><br/>During the opening few minutes, Jamie (Miila Kunis) and Dylan (Justin Timberlake) are both dumped by their respective significant others, prompting each to decide that it's time to take a break from everything resembling an emotional relationship. These opening bits are truthful, biting, and played off with a wonderful wink and smile to set up the entire tone of Friends With Benefits right from the starting gate.<br/><br/>Dylan is a veritable hot-shot at a dot-com when head hunter Jamie is hired to wrangle him as GQ's newest art director. When Jamie wines and dines Dylan in New York, attempting to close the deal on his taking the GQ gig, there are moments of genuine chemistry between the on-screen couple. Kunis, who is at the absolute peak of her celebrity right now, is charming, beautiful, and generally full of a real personality. Jamie is not perfect, and Kunis plays that perfectly.<br/><br/>On the flip side, Timberlake is extremely well cast, pulling on his boyish charms and good looks to breeze his way through lines and moments that could be extremely corny, but come off with poise and ease in his hands. Timberlake has now earned his place in movies -- he can stay, even though this and his performance in The Social Network feel more ""directed"" than ""acted"" per se, he's been smart in choosing roles that fit him as he gets his feet wet. Honestly, it sounds like the start that a lot of mainstay Hollywood stars have had. <br/><br/>After a few months in New York, Dylan and Jamie decide that they should adopt a friend with benefits lifestyle, as each are done with the dating game. After the ground rules are set, the two get to it. These first sex scenes between the two are some of the most entertaining in the movie, with Gluck's direction never letting one joke linger too long, just in case it didn't hit with the impact it needed. The first half of the film is a combination of clever writing (think Nora Ephron, but she's grown up with the internet) and quick editing to keep the pace and flow as upbeat as possible (exactly the same way Easy A , Gluck's previous effort, operated).<br/><br/>The plot finally comes around, as the back and forth connection between Dylan and Jamie becomes apparent, and the two are forced to actually deal with their feelings for each other, and share other feelings between each other as well. Friends With Benefits is a romantic comedy, so the typical situations of overhearing a conversation that was misunderstood and a brief entrance of a potential love interest are all in place. It's obvious Friends With Benefits is aware of the mold, but it's not about to go breaking it, either.<br/><br/>Overall: It's obvious that Gluck is perfecting the art of the new rom- com. Fired Up!, Easy A, and now Friends WIth Benefits have given rise to the John Hughes of the internet generation. Pulling in the best elements from the classic '30s and '40s ethereal cinematic romances, touches of Woody Allen's pace and conversational flow, and dialing up a Nora Ephron-esque charm in his screenplays (and screenplay adaptations), Will Gluck has another winner -- far better than that ""other"" sex without attachment movie.<br/><br/>Easter Egg: When Jamie is waiting to pick up Dylan from the airport, notice the name on the sheet of paper she steals: O. Penderghast. (Olive Penderghast was Emma Stone's character in Easy A.)"

","**1/2 out of (****)<br/><br/>Just three weeks after the new year, ""No Strings Attached"" was conceived. It was a raunchy, yet lighthearted comedy about friends using each other for just sex, with no emotion involved. Simply a mere physical act. Fast-forward to half the year and you got ""Friends with Benefits"". With a story nearly identical and characters just as zippy and charismatic, you think the quality would be the same. And well... you'd sort of be correct. The difference is ""Benefits"" is a slightly better production thanks to a few new tweaks here and there, but technically, it really is just the same movie. <br/><br/>Let's start off with the performances. Kunis and Timberlake have decent chemistry together, but not as great as I was led to believe. They portray a realistic couple and are enthusiastic and well-suited in their roles, but only when they need to be. The story? Nothing groundbreaking. Some heartfelt and touching scenes, along with the more comical ones, so it's all a win-win. Now for a sex comedy, does it push the envelope? If you thought ""No Strings Attached"" was a little skimpy on what it promises, then you'll be more than satisfied with this one. The sex is there, it's explicit, and just downright raunchy. Make no mistake here. Mix in a plethora of sex jokes and multiple f bombs and you pretty much have this movie. But to my surprise, the sex element wasn't that substantial. Probably just for the first third.<br/><br/>All in all, is this a film I'd recommend? Yes, but take it as a mild one. It hits all the right notes but it's not as great as others lead you to believe. If you are impulsive and can't wait to see this movie, hit up a matinée. It's a cut above most of what's offered, but it's nothing you have to rush out to see. Overall a decent movie."

","I couldn't stand this movie. Yes, it poked fun at other romantic comedies, but it was all the same old crap, no matter how much warning there is that they're going to be cheesy, it's still cheesy. Justin Timberlake is a funny character, but his acting skills still need improving. I guess practice makes perfect. Mila Kunis got a little annoying. I feel as though she's still playing Jackie a little bit. Her character in Black Swan was the most different character I've ever seen her play and she had very few lines in that movie. SPOILERS BELOW. LOTS OF SPOILERS BELOW. These two characters could not have been more cliché for a romantic comedy. This was especially shown with Justin Timberlake's character being a little feminine secretly and having all these embarrassing things (sneezing, afraid of heights, his childhood music interests) while Mila has no really embarrassing things going on.<br/><br/>Then there was the curve ball with Justin's character's father having Alzheimer's's. They tried to have some sort of touching moment, but it failed miserably. They should've left that out entirely. <br/><br/>During the flash mob scene in the beginning, any idiot that has ever seen a romantic comedy would know at that point that the flash mob would end up playing the role as the BIG MOMENT in the end of the movie. It was incredibly cliché, incredibly predictable and the acting was sub-par at best. <br/><br/>A positive was Woody Harrelson. He stole every scene he was in. He was the only good part."

And this is the case after her spectacular performance in The Black Swan. Showing Ms. Kunis prancing around in her undies is really sad. She is a wonderful actress and comedian, not a sex object. And the story itself is pure fluff meant to showcase the male lead, which is really ludicrous. How can Mila Kunis be so grievously miscast? Ms. Kunis is a powerful actress, who has a dominating screen presence, yet she plays second fiddle to the male lead who showcases his body. The story itself is sheer sentimentality covered by a veneer of trash-talking language meant to create an impression of being chic and cool, which is totally out of sinc with the characters themselves who are so shallow that their coolness is a sham. Toward the end of movie Ms. Kunis is finally allowed to display some of her dramatic skills, but it is too little too late as the the damage has been done and the movie comes to a quick and improbable end. The problem with showcasing a male lead in this movie is that the audience is asked to accept the premise that the male actor is more attractive than the female lead and therefore deserves more attention, but in this movie, that definitely does not work. Just like with Pretty Woman, this movie should have showcased the female lead and without making her act like a tramp. Mila Kunis is talented and beautiful; let her be the star."

","Actually I will start by saying something good about this, it won't take long though. All the good I can find in this movie is the main characters acting. Both Kunis and Timberlake handles their respective roles very well as they usually do, and it's easily seen that they work good together. That was the good part.<br/><br/>To the bad parts: Come on! I don't know how many times I've seen movies like this. Just another romantic sex comedy to put in the pile. They meet and talk, they have sex, they fight, the guy contacts the girl, and it ends with forgiving and a kiss. I love new creative concepts. Oh, I forgot to mention they have even more sex before they fight.<br/><br/>There are a lot of oneliners in ""Friends with Beneftis"" and quick answers we all know doesn't happen in real life. It can be cool with a fast dialogue in movies, absolutely, but it's happening too frequently here to make it somewhat realistic. I'm sorry to say it's sometimes pathetic how predictable this is. Can't they come up with some new scripts in Hollywood anymore? It even went so far they have a scene by the Hollywood sign to fill out some minutes. <br/><br/>No, I can't recommend this. As mentioned both Kunis and Timberlake are brilliant actors but with a bad and predictable script it doesn't help much."

","The movie was entirely predictable since it was, after all, a formulaic chick flick (Boy meets girl, good moments, bad moments, almost break up and then patch up leading to Happily ever after). But it was funny at times and had some poignant moments thrown in for good measure. Justin Timberlake, though he's getting typecast in fast talking smooth operator type roles, was good. Mila Kunis was better and they had pretty nice chemistry together. I like how they broke couple of stereotypes (art director, sports editor, who was probably the funniest, BTW). Her mom's character was funny as well. It won't stick with you, but it won't bore you while you're in there either. Good one to watch w/ your SO. <br/><br/>6/10"
"Turfseer","3","4","8","31 August 2012"," Clueless commitmentphobes transformed in old fashioned morality tale masquerading as urban comedy
","Jamie is an executive recruiter who recruits Dylan, a young, up and coming art director for a small internet company in Los Angeles, to come to NYC and work for the much more high powered GQ Magazine. Before this happens, there's a prologue showing their back story: both are going through another unsuccessful relationship with a member of the opposite sex. When Jamie and Dylan meet each other for the first time, they're both jaded, as they've been burned one too many times, in their quest for 'true romance'.<br/><br/>While getting to know each other, they watch a parody of a romcom (romantic comedy) on TV, both bemoaning the pitfalls of traditional courtships and wondering perhaps how they can circumvent all the complications associated with traditional romance. They forge an unlikely friendship where they can avoid any kind of commitment in the relationship and simply enjoy sex for its own sake. Hence, the 'benefits' is the satisfaction of having the sexual relationship without the commitment.<br/><br/>Soon, the film's scenarists strategy of setting us up for an old fashioned morality tale, becomes clear. The 'friends with benefits' program--that is, sex without commitment, is only part and parcel of a larger overall problem with the personalities of our protagonists. Jamie and Dylan are unfortunately narcissistic, coarse and immature.<br/><br/>The film's scenarists would like us to laugh at Jamie and Dylan, as they expose their foibles in the first thirty minutes or so. Jamie, the perennial go-getter, obnoxiously puts down Dylan, who extols the virtues of wide-open, west coast living as opposed to what he regards as the cramped living style of New Yorkers (the put-down becomes clear when Jamie sarcastically cracks, ""What are you, a Gazelle?).<br/><br/>If Jamie's coarseness is off-putting, it pales in comparison to Dylan's complete cluelessness. Dylan is so narcissistic that he simply can't understand why he's so wrong about Captain Sully. People rightly perceive that he's stubborn and ignorant when he claims 'planes fly themselves'. In reality, Captain Sully's plane was almost completely disabled due to the bird strike and could not possibly fly itself. So he's wrong on that count and 'tunes out' all those who are justifiably angry with him.<br/><br/>Dylan's myopic 'Sully stance' is indicative of what's wrong with the first third of the film. By trying to 'humanize' the characters, exposing them as deeply flawed human beings, the film's scenarists have gone too far and made them out to be decidedly unlikeable. Somehow the Sully joke needed to be lighter and not cast Dylan in such a negative light. That way, we would care more about him at the end, when he finally does redeem himself. The same goes for Jamie whose constant use of expletives coupled with her overreaching competitiveness, also casts her in a negative light, during the expository sequences.<br/><br/>The failed comedy of exposing the two 'losers' who adopt the self-defeating 'friends with benefits' program becomes a much more traditional romance in Act II and III, not unlike the 'film within a film' parody of the romcom the two lovers watch and disparage early on. It doesn't take long for Jamie to have true feelings for Dylan, after he invites her to California to meet his family and they have an intimate tryst. But Dylan remains locked in his fear of commitment and after Jamie overhears him putting her down while talking with his sister, the third act crisis is precipitated.<br/><br/>It takes a little while longer before Dylan redeems himself by realizing how selfish he's been, but with the aid of two key allies, he finally sees the light. The allies who counsel Dylan are of course, Tommy, his gay co-worker, delightfully played by Woody Harrelson and Dylan's Alzheimer's afflicted father, Mr. Harper (solidly and convincingly played by Richard Jenkins).<br/><br/>Couldn't you guess, but despite Mr. Harper's fluctuating memory loss, he manages to impart to his son, a tale of long lost love which turns out to be the big lesson here: don't let your best shot at love slip away.<br/><br/>It's all very predictable and sentimental but Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis do seem to exude some chemistry, working together. I only wish their characters were a little less alienating and a little more gregarious in the first thirty to forty minutes.<br/><br/>In the end, 'Benefits' can only live up to its billing for its romance and not its comedy. Simply put, there's nothing funny about obnoxious, clueless people. But once these protagonists are transformed, they do become a bit more likable. Still, is this rather predictable 'love-fest', a film you'll remember for a long time? I doubt it quite a bit.<br/><br/>As an old fashioned morality tale, where a misguided couple realizes the error of their ways and finds 'true love' in the process, 'Benefits' fits in well with the pantheon of mediocre romcoms, populating our movie theaters today."
"p-stepien","4","4","8","30 June 2012"," Overly cliché and laboured
","After another failed relationship high-rolling blog entrepreneur Dylan Harper (Justin Timberlake) and head-hunter Jamie Rellis (Mila Kunis) decide to forfeit on love and commitments. Per chance Jamie headhunts the LA settled Dylan to become the chief editor of GQ monthly, the New York. On his arrival to the Big Apple the two hitch onto their instant connection, chatting through the days and wise-cracking on the same wave-length. Not wanting to dissolve the friendship, but at the same time in the midst of an ongoing sex-drought, the two decide to enter an understanding: Just sex. No strings attached. What happens from then on is... pretty anticipatable. At first things are perfectly fine, but then an epiphany or two changes the state of affairs into something less raunchy and more heartwarming.<br/><br/>Romantic comedies are essentially my guilty pleasure (psst... don't pass the word around), often intaking a few to lessen the intensity levels following more ambitious cinema. Despite being able to fill in the dots several scenes ahead, they do offer a certain respite and touch the less cynical side of a human being. However cliché and stereotypical the two leads or predictable the outcome, the key issue is proper chemistry and some honest laughs. Unfortunately ""Friends with Benefits"" offers two mildly intriguing characters with pet peeves and supposedly cute idiosyncrasies, who are provided with well-meant, but laboured, dialogue. They end up attempting to talk there way into the viewer's sympathy with mildly entertaining punchlines, forced deliveries reeking of pretentiousness or mistimed comedic flow. Even worse some of the ideas spun into the move are outdated (like the whole flash mob concept) and just don't help to build the character's credibility.<br/><br/>The best thing in the movie is Dylan's father (played by Richard Jenkins), an Alzheimer afflicted heart-warming character, which single-handedly manages to instill a sense of honesty to the end resolution, despite all the dismembered emotionality of preceding events. Unfortunately for the lead cast the show is basically stolen by supporting actors with Jamie Clarkson as Jamie's hippie sex crazed mom and Woody Harrelson as a gay sports editor stealing all of the thunder whenever on screen."
"plasticanimalz","3","4","8","21 April 2012"," Uff, this was bad
","My motivation for see this was that I thought 'No Strings Attached' was hilarious and I like Milla Kunis. The previews for this film looked like it would be funny, and though I don't really care for Justin as an actor, I like him on 'SNL,' so, I thought he would at least be funny. This seemed to me like it was a rushed project. I got the feeling the whole time that this was written by some decent writers in the 2 nights and filmed in 2 weeks. Everything felt rushed, predictable and cliché. Maybe a better actor could have pulled Justin's lines off better, giving them some punch...but instead, whenever he and Milla and long diatribe's of banter, I felt like I was watching an acting scene in a class, rather than a movie. It also felt like maybe they had as much time to rehearse the scenes as a cold reading. The only good thing about the movie was Woody Harrelson. He was great. Milla's mom was good..., some of the lines were good, but too rushed through to really come across as good or leave any weight, and Milla and Justin had good chemistry. The only thing believable about this film was that they would make good friends. A good couple, is questionable, but they at least seemed to be having fun together. The movie was also extremely formula with no twists or surprises. I didn't see the flash mob coming, at the end, but, really, who cares. I would not call that a good or emotional scene. It seemed more like this went on in a producer meeting. ""Flash mobs are big right now. We should throw one in there at least a couple times. The audience loves it when the actors do a group singing number in a film, and flash mobs are the next big thing!"" EHHHHHH!!!!! Wrong. There was one, of sorts, in 'Enchanted,' but it worked only because it was a musical and was more of a Broadway number than a flash mob. I didn't care about anyone in this film. And how can you when it's paint-by-the-numbers formula without any real depth whatsoever? Everything in this film was a gimmick to make you ""feel"" something, but it was so all so transparent and spoon fed that it didn't carry any weight.<br/><br/>Justin should stick to singing. He's not a good actor. Being a good sketch actor on 'SNL' does not mean you can read lines. The only reason he was halfway OK, but I wouldn't go as far as good, in ""The Social Network' was because his part was small and he wasn't really acting, he just seemed to be reading lines and being himself. Not to mention, he's got a nice body but kind of Cro-Magnon looking. Without singing and dancing I don't really get his appeal...unless, of course, when he's Photoshopped. And him as an action star is even more ridiculous. What happened to the days of guys like Keanau Reeves? I mean, Jeremy Renner, Justin Timberlake, Adrian Brody? Seriously? None of these guys look like they could even take a serious punch, nor do they look lithe and stealth enough to avoid one. Though, I'm getting off track of the romantic comedy massacre, of this film.<br/><br/>It was on every level bad, other than Woody Harrleson, and completely unbelievable, on every level. The fact that Justin, or a 26-yr-old, is some high-paid sought after art director is ridiculous. They might as well have said he was a wealthy astronaut, which would have been just as believable. Topher Grace could pull off the young, over-achieving marketing director in that Dennis Quaid film, because he's a good actor...and they played up the fact that it was unusual for someone so young to be in that position.<br/><br/>Watch 'No Strings Attached,' rather than wasting any time on this film. Two great actors, great script, great chemistry, feel good. This is a film Milla should have turned down 'cause it did nothing for her career, and only cemented for me to avoid Justin in starring roles. He's just not good. The only film I liked him in was 'Southland Tales,' but he didn't say that much, does a musical number, and it was more of a cameo that added a funny element to the film. This was probably one of the worst romantic comedies I've seen in a long time. Two thumbs down."

","Friends With Benefits (2011): Dir: Will Gluck / Cast: Justin Timberlake, Mila Kunis, Woody Harrelson, Patricia Clarkson, Jenna Elfman: Xerox piece of sh*t about crossing friendship and sex. We have seen this bullshit situation a million times. In fact, No Strings Attached was released earlier in the year and seems like the same stupid plot. Leaving all details aside, it breaks down like this. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis meet after they have broken up in other relationships. Now they decide to avoid feelings and have lots of sex. What is so pathetic about this is how it jerks viewers around. We know where this is headed. Timberlake and Kunis have sex and pretend that they don't care for each other then tension interrupts their friendship. Then they avoid each other before that overly bullshit contrived ending that works like a punch to the groin. The supporting roles are even more over the top. Woody Harrelson plays a co-worker of Timberlake's and he is openly gay to the point of being too creepy. Patricia Clarkson plays Kunis's mother who shows up drunk and plays off the world's most idiotic cougar. Clarkson is a decent performer but here she is undone by the absurdity of the role and its over the top presentation. Jenna Elfman is also hilarious but none of that comes across in this junk. This is directed by Will Gluck who made the witty and funny teen comedy Easy A. He doesn't strike lightning twice here. We are given enticing musical street numbers that are suppose to reference films that are far better than this. Friends will benefit by just avoiding this stupid film. Score: 3 / 10"

"zkonedog","6","1","1","10 March 2017"," When Justin Met Mila
","In 1989, Meg Ryan faked an orgasm, Billy Crystal droned about ""sex getting in the way"" of male- female friendship, and the basis for nearly every romantic comedy since was formed ""When Harry Met Sally"". This film follows the same basic premise...but at the same time turns it completely on its head.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Friends with Benefits"" sees ""headhunter"" (or business recruiter) Jamie (Mila Kunis) meet Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and try to convince him to move to New York City to work for GQ. After seeing the sights and getting to know each other a bit, Jamie & Dylan (in order to avoid all the ""complications"" of a normal relationship) decide to engage in a ""just sex"" type of mutual agreement. From there, of course, things begin to veer off course and get a bit tenuous between the two.<br/><br/>Considering that this type of film has been done to death, ""Friends With Benefits"" is actually pretty good. Justin & Mila have great on-screen chemistry, the plot is a good mix of sappy & serious, and (at times) it will make you laugh (although many of those will be uncomfortable chuckles if watching with an audience).<br/><br/>Besides the irreverent fare (which would probably prevent this movie from being a ""classic"" anyway), the only problem I had with this film was how strange it was for the two leads to be playing against type. Usually, Timberlake is the ""crazy guy"" and Kunis is the ""uptight witchy girl""...that is how we are accustomed to seeing those actors. Here, however, Timberlake is a bit more reserved while Kunis goes through a gambit of emotions from beginning to end. The chemistry between the two, as I mentioned, was great, but it was awkward seeing them against type.<br/><br/>Overall, though, this is a decent rom-com that provides (in equal parts): sexual escapades, tongue-in-cheek humor, character development, & an engaging plot. It may not be an all-time great, but ""Friends with Benefits"" most definitely has its moments."

There is absolutely no fresh point it deals with that has been dealt 100 times before. No innovative/brilliant screenplay or narration, cinematography/visuals or background score.

Harrelson is constantly asking Timberlake to go out for drinks, so the can hit on men and women respectively. Timberlake always refuses, but half way through the movie he agrees. At this point we expect some funny scenes watching Harrelson on the prowl.

I learned just how accomplished Justin Timberlake is. Singer, dancer and actor. Mila Kunis is his match emotionally in this film.<br/><br/>It must be very difficult to create a romantic comedy based upon human frailty, based upon the characters' deepest yearnings and deepest fears. I think the movie did a good job of doing that. Even Woody Harrelson's character who started out as a caricature in the beginning of the movie, evanesced into a caring, compassionate, supportive human being - behind the facade of his seemingly crass humor.<br/><br/>As always, Richard Jenkins was an actor that all of the characters could hang their performances upon.<br/><br/>This is a movie with very touching, rather endearing humor,inclusive, not exclusive humor.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised, especially after reading many reviews which almost steered me away from watching it at all."
"rogerdarlington","Null","3","6","10 April 2012"," Friends with no strings but benefits attached
","Hollywood movies often come in pairs as films with the same premise are released within months of one another. ""Friends With Benefits"" and ""No Strings Attached"" were released very close to one another and both pose the question of whether it is possible for a couple simply to have sex and be friends without becoming emotionally or even romantically involved. Many men have never had any problem with this concept and Hollywood is now toying with the issue of whether liberated women can think the same. There are no prizes for guessing the conclusion of both romantic comedies but it's entertaining to see how each film works round to essentially the same ending.<br/><br/>This time round the guy is Dylan (Justin Timberlake) who moves from Los Angeles to New York to take on a new job at the behest of headhunter Jamie (Mila Kunis). Like ""No Strings Attached"", ""Friends With Benefits"" has a lot of talk about sex - the script is sharp and often funny - but remarkably coy when it comes to showing it with nothing more risqué than a bare back. The film makes fun of movies that are overly romantic while coming quite close to being one of the works it parodies. So innocent fun which finishes up being rather old-fashioned. The French would have done it differently."

When Patricia Clarkson uttered one word which I shall not repeat here, about 3/4 of the way through the film, I left.

","I came into the movie skeptical, not knowing what to expect. Before the screening I expected Friends With Benefits to be a carbon copy of No Strings Attached just with different actors/actresses. Having watched the movie however it is much more than that. While following the same basic idea, the story line, jokes, and acting made for a much better movie. The movie managed to feel less like a common chick flick and more like your traditional comedy, appealing to both men and women. The target audience is clearly the 20-somethings but its appeal extends far beyond that. Friends With Benefits manages to produce laugh after laugh without being overly raunchy which is impressive given the subject matter. The chemistry between Timberlake and Kunis also gave the romantic side of the movie credibility. All this being said the funniest part of the entire movie was seeing Woody Harrelson play an extremely outwardly gay man, a stark contrast to the majority of his acting roles. At the end of the day Friends With Benefits pulled off what few romantic comedies do, combined the right amount of laughter, romance, and plot to create a movie perfectly fit for your night out with your significant other."

Timberlake's acting in this is weak, his jokes are not funny, and his character is just boring, which makes it a bit tedious to watch.<br/><br/>On the other hand, though she wasn't really that funny, Mila Kunis' acting seems to make up for her co-star's, as her performance is way more convincing, her character is light-hearted and spontaneous which was nice to watch .<br/><br/>The directing and editing of this wasn't good at all. The trailer leads one to believe that this is a hilarious film, and indeed I laughed at the jokes in the trailer. But whilst watching the film, there seemed to have been long pauses, which made the jokes not as witty or even funny. The trailer's editing is indeed much better than the actual film's. However, the jokes coming from Woody Harrelson and Patricia Clarkson were worth watching, and almost compensated for the lack of humour from the central characters, but I still wouldn't recommend this film to anyone."

In fact there is a fake rom-com in this movie where they point out all the movie clichés that they won't fall for. There's just something unlikeable about an anti-rom-com. There's a reason why formula rom-com has been successful for so long. The fact that both Jamie and Dylan try so hard to be detached emotionally makes this story emotionally detached.

","The premise of ""Friendships with benefits"" is not a novel thing in Hollywood. Some might even say that it is a very old motif and lacking in originality. And, ""They"" would be right! More so, when two extremely similar films are released within the very same year. If you missed it, the other one is No Strings Attached and looks like a carbon copy of Friends with Benefits. The punch lines and jokes delivered by main leads, Kunis and Timberlake, are often clinical and sound rushed in. It fails to connect emotionally, seemingly missing the mark as a romantic comedy; On the other hand, the comedic parts are rather acceptable, due to the help of supporting cast- Specifically, a note worthy performance from Woody Harrelson and amusing cameo appearances by Shaun White. I have no problem believing that Kunis and Timberlake are good off screen friends. But, on screen, they completely lack chemistry thus leaving the stereotyped ending lifeless and unromantic!

Now the obvious flaw in this is that nulling emotion to achieve these other things isn't actually possible, what we're removing is the social inhibitions: they just did it arbitrarily.<br/><br/>If the entire movie wasn't about how the thing that they're trying to avoid is inevitable, then I would say that it was actually somewhat progressively leading towards a world where social expectations didn't lead our romantic encounters, but we did, however long they may or may not be.<br/><br/>The clear problems lie in both the biology of a woman having to carry the child (though not necessarily THE woman, but that causes issues as well), and the egotism that leads people to attempt to control the entire situation because of a biological tick: i.e. when one is ""suddenly"" ready to have a baby, those hormones prevent considering if the other person involved wants that, and don't necessarily open one's mind to having the baby elsewhere.<br/><br/>Part of that is the design of passing genes forward, and the rest is social conventions: i.e. it's a very complicated problem.<br/><br/>Back to the movie, it's a lot of fun, it's funny, it's sexy (they're naked and pressed against each other like a 3rd of the movie), but it's not deep because being deep on these topics isn't palatable, see above or the 3rd act of the movie.<br/><br/>I think the people that will truly relate to all of this movie wouldn't watch this movie, but there are likely parts you'll relate to or at least enjoy."

The additional footage makes perfect sense for hardcore fans, these additional scenes are not only at times funny but they extend an offering of extra ""hope"" and sometimes ""explanation"" of scenes that were previously concluded.<br/><br/>The TWO disc special edition is a perfect trade in for anyone who rushed out to purchase the film when it released in stores. On your second disc you will find an amazing conversation between show Creator Michael Patrick King and Executive producer / Star, Sarah Jessica Parker. Together they discuss everything from the process of character development - to fashion decisions with Pat Field. You will also find three additional scenes that did NOT make it into the extended cut of the film which are alternate takes on what you DID see make the final cut.<br/><br/>Overall I rated this product ***** stars because it is a collector's DREAM to carry this film as a personal memento of appreciation, fandom and hope. Without plot give away - I will simply say this ....

","Both Timberlake and Kunis have recently broken up with their partner. Kunis plays a recruiter for GQ magazine, and Timberlake is someone she ""stalked"" to head up their Art department. Timberlake's ex-gf is Emma Stone. What is interesting is that Kunis' character is the laid back type of person we would expect Emma Stone to play, while Stone (what little we see of her) plays an emotional character we would expect Kunis to play. I don't know if the producers did this by design, or they just lucked into it, but knowing this made the movie funny on a different level. Kunis is savvy enough to realize she has been ruined by romantic movies as she awaits her Prince to sweep her off her feet. You know at the end of the movie, come running to her as she is about to leave, and pour his heart out to her.<br/><br/>Kunis gives Timberlake a fast paced tour of NY, perhaps one of the best sells for Manhattan I have seen in a long time. The movie verbally condemns Hollywood's romantic comedies while ironically creating one identical to it. With some quick character build up, the film goes to a scene where Timberlake and Kunis decide that they will have sex without the emotional baggage while swearing on a Bible app. No complications, just sex. Guess how that turns out?<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson plays a gay sports editor who is not shy about being gay. Woody gives Timberlake love advice, ""It's not who you want to spend Friday night with, but who you want to spend all day Saturday with.""<br/><br/>The sex scenes between Kunis and Timberlake are more comical than romantic. Timberlake likes to keep his socks on and sneezes after an orgasm, and Kunis is a screamer. Patricia Clarkson plays Kunis' super hip mother, who has never really told her daughter who her father was. In her first few minutes he was Greek, Puerto Rican, or Russian...she is sure he was Eurasian.<br/><br/>The dialogue is fast and witty. Kunis did a background check on a guy she dated.<br/><br/>Timberlake responds: ""Did you do a background check on me?""<br/><br/>Kunis:""How could you possibly max out an Old Navy card?""<br/><br/>Timberlake: ""I was just out of college and really into cargo pants.""<br/><br/>In spite of the adult themes, the movie has a lighthearted chick flick Disney quality to it. The acting was good. The movie was very clever. If you liked ""No Strings Attached"" you might find this one on par or slightly better.<br/><br/>F-bomb,sex, brief nudity, deals with Alzheimer's"

I thought Kunis was great and you could feel a real chemistry between her and Timberlake. They both worked well together. <br/><br/>The plot is well worked at the start, and I really enjoyed the first hour.

","The romance is pretty much diminished by the physical act of casual sexual intercourse. There is more sex in this than films like 50 Shades of Grey and Nymphomaniac, films designed to showcase this physical act of love. Problem is, this film is so bland and formulaic that its not innovative in the slightest. You've seen it a hundred times. A couple promise to just engage in casual sex, what is known as friends with benefits, but naturally start developing feelings for each other. You can coat its core with layers of harmless fun all you want, it still remains the same. Ironically, it attempts to deconstruct the genre. There is a pivotal scene where the couple watch a rom-com and distinguish typical elements that make a 'Hollywood' film and the negative connotations it represents. Pop music at the credits, unrealistic eternal love and the endless amount of clichés. I honestly thought the film would then utilise these and flip the genre on its side...but no. Ironically, it follows the exact same formula that makes a 'Hollywood' rom-com. Is that supposed to be funny? No. If anything, it is wasted potential. It's strongest asset is the script which has various humorous moments and brings plenty of charisma to our lead characters who are played by the irresistible Mila Kunis and mediocre Justin Timberlake. The person I was watching this film with has memorised the script...by heart...indicating that it sticks with certain people. Just not me. Kunis is great, sure all I hear is Meg from Family Guy but she played the role well. Timberlake cannot act. Sorry, but I just dislike the guy. Everything he does feels forced and uncomfortable to watch, and occasionally Kunis suffers the same fate. Like watching two pieces of cardboard trying to become a work of art but actually disintegrates and biodegrades into the Earth. The supporting cast were instantly forgettable. I admire how the plot explores the complications and impracticality of having a friend with benefits. It's a pass from me."

Kunis plays a big city corporate ""headhunter"" dumped by a guy who, in real life, wouldn't tie her shoes. She then hires Justin Timberlake into their big city firm. Their job doesn't matter and both actors seem way too young for their occupations – much of the dialog sounds forced into the mouths of two actors better suited for a college-based TV show.<br/><br/>But both try their best to make the premise believable: two beautiful people agree to remain friends with benefits i.e. they can have great sex but won't be in an actual relationship. Of course they wind up falling for each other but there's a lot happening before this inevitable conclusion – which is never fully realized.<br/><br/>The scriptwriters try so hard to stray from the cookie-cutter rom-com template that there's a movie within a movie (starring Jason Segel) that purposely basks in clichés, including manipulate sappy soundtrack and banal one-liners: making it clear to the characters and audience we're breaking new ground. But are we? This premise has been done before, but Kunis and Timberlake have an essential chemistry to make their sexual escapades – and the morning-after banter sparking an inevitably tense kinship – feel fresh and involving. <br/><br/>Patricia Clarkson adds the needed aged experience as Kunis's quirky mom and Woody Harrelson's turn as Timberlake's gay pal basks in intentional scene-stealing dialog.

","Don't expect something new out of this. It just an ordinary romantic comedy movie that always tell about how beautiful and great love is.<br/><br/>I watch this movie with my girlfriend who made me to watch it. Well, i don't want to watch it, but then she told me that Mila Kunis get naked in it, then i agree to watch it.<br/><br/>The film take of from a guy who got a job offer in New York and pick up by a girl in the airport and show how great New York is, then he agree to take the job. He and she quickly become a friend, since he just move in to New York. My favorite part of this movie is, when they both watch a romantic comedy in the DVD, and she asked: ""why there is no movie that show what happen after the big kiss (the happily ever after part)?"" and he answer: ""yeah they made it, it call porn"".<br/><br/>Well, overall it just the same old romantic comedy that the both main character got fell in loved to each other and nothing new to it.

","I have a friend, a 50-ish lady, who not long ago described her relationship with a certain man as ""we are friends, with benefits."" Honestly I had never heard it described that way, but she explained it. Then this movie came out and I was leery. But then we saw it, and both my wife and I thought it is pretty good. The dialog is snappy and rings true, and the two leads are quite good and convincing.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake is Dylan Harper, a hot-shot West Coast editor on a web-based publication, and gets offered an interview trip to New York, for the job as editor for GQ Magazine. He says he is just going for the trip, but things develop.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis is the headhunter, Jamie Rellis. She meets him at the airport, and when he balks at considering the job she tells him, ""I am not going to try to sell you on the job, I'm going to sell you on New York."" She succeeds, he moves to the City, the two of them are naturally relaxed and fun together, and become best friends.<br/><br/>Then, just bantering one day one of them suggests, why go without sex while we are both between relationships, let's just do it, with no strings attached, and it will be like playing tennis. When it is over we shake hands and say see you around.<br/><br/>Of course if that had worked then there wouldn't be much of a movie past that point. It gets romantically complicated when they both begin to have deeper feelings for each other and at the same time deny those feelings.<br/><br/>Three other characters add greatly to the enjoyment of the movie. Patricia Clarkson is Jamie's wild and loose mother, who shows up without notice, and at least once Jamie and Dylan are in bed, naked when she walks in.<br/><br/>Old reliable Richard Jenkins is Dylan's dad, with early onset of dementia. Sometimes he just takes off his pants, in public, because he gets tired of wearing them. But in the end he gives his son the key advice, if you think she even might be the one, go after her. Life is short.<br/><br/>And Woody Harrelson is Tommy Bollinger, the openly gay sports editor. He plays the part perfectly.<br/><br/>A fun, entertaining movie, but for adults."

","This film was fairly good and had a few chuckles in it but the story was dragged out a little too much. As a projectionist I tend to miss the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film because I'm busy sorting stuff out up in the projection booth. This means that I sometimes miss the true meaning of some films. But with this film I caught on pretty well and rather liked the film. I would definitely recommend going to see this film if you enjoy a mixture of romance and comedy. This film is only 1hr and 49min long but I thought that it went on for over 2 hours. The story line in this film could have been a little more fast pace to keep the audience a little more motivated. The story line is great but a little confusing, so keep your hearing at a high when watching this film. This film is definitely suited for both male and female audiences and is not another one of those chick flicks that girls enjoy watching and the boys just cant stand. It's an all-rounder for both male and female viewers and a great laugh. Don't think that you don't want to watch it because I said its a little long... go and enjoy yourselves.

Brilliant movie.I was expecting this to be very poor with Justin in it but now think there could not have been a better person to play this part, not to mention the fact that Mila Kunis is sexy, funny and hot in this movie. I think that the shear notion of friends with benefits is something most of us has considered just shows it cannot work but the comedy that can ensue to find this out is sometimes priceless as this movie shows.

","I am a little surprised by some of the negative reviews posted here about this movie. What did these people think they were going to see, Shakespeare? Ibsen? Shaw? Come on people, it is a romantic comedy, and a pretty good one at that. Clichéd? Uhhh, a romantic comedy is one big cliché. Did anyone really think that ... SPOILER ALERT... they weren't going to end up together at the end of the film???? If she died, or he got hit by a bus, it would be a drama or tragedy, not a rom-com. The two stars showed surprising chemistry in this film. Mila Kunis was articulate, funny, adorable, heck I fell in love with her. Plus she really has a flare for comedic timing. If you compare this film to its ugly 2011 clone 'No Strings Attached', you start to wonder if the wrong actress from 'Black Swan' got the awards. Justin Timberlake was equally effective. I bought these two as a couple. The rest of the cast was certainly up to the task. Patricia Clarkson seems to be getting type-cast as the kooky mother, and Richard Jenkins was good as the Alzheimer suffering, but endearing father. Woody Harrelson turned his 5 minutes of screen time into another over-the-top performance. Over all, this is a slight, fun, modern (plenty of swearing) romantic comedy, filled with enough cultural references that it will feel dated in 10 years. It doesn't pretend to be high art, and you shouldn't judge it that way either."

I laughed the whole way through! Only a couple of small corny parts that slightly threw it off but you had to expect it because it's a chic flick. I would actually pay to see this again!

","8/10. Pretty good and funny. Sometime mild predictable moments but it was forgiving because of the situation. The acting and chemistry between Justin Timerlake and Mila Kunis was great. There was a good mix of drama and comedy and the film wasn't over-done with clichés apart from when the film deliberately was meant to be cliché as a joke. Highly recommended drama/comedy/romance film. If you are a guy, don't get put off with the romance aspect of the film, it's not lingered upon much and is more comedy and drama and enough to appeal to a group of friends who want to see a good comedy film at the cinema or just a adult couple who want to see something for a good laugh."

","As I started watching this movie the first thing I noticed was Justin Timberlake's horrible acting. Honestly, the guy shouldn't be in movies this way. He always acts as, more or less, his real life self (a unisexual boy with a cute voice and good social intelligence).<br/><br/>The movie was more or less a sex romp with popular songs as background music and hints of homosexuality from supposedly straight actors (?).<br/><br/>Personally I enjoyed the last half of the movie more than the first, to be honest the first half of the movie was the biggest piece of rubbish I've seen in a long time. It made me think that the actors were somehow tricked into signing up for the movie, because no one in their right mind would volunteer for such a lousy script. The whole romance satire thing was overdone, and I could never quite figure out who the target audience was supposed to be. Was the movie made for college kids, teenagers or adults? It didn't quite fit into any of the categories and just left me confused and annoyed. What was I watching?<br/><br/>Nevertheless, there was some good stuff in the movie toward the later half which left me giving this movie 5 stars (would've been 2 stars if it kept going like the first half)."

","Who doesn't love Mila Kunis? Not many people! She's so compulsively watchable that it's hard to think of an actress more popular with males AND females at the moment. Her teaming up with JT makes Friends With Benefits everything No Strings Attached wasn't. Obviously the two films have the same plot line, there are a few bits and pieces which are different but all in all pretty much the same, the characters in this film are so much more fun, sexy and worth your time.<br/><br/>There's a bit more raunch in this movie which I think adds a lot to the plot, the fact that the characters actually do seem like friends is definitely a plus for this movie, for me the chemistry between Mila and JT is electric.<br/><br/>Full props to Justin Timberlake too, he gets better and better with each film, he has made the transition from music to film quite well. Patricia Clarkson is divine as usual, I take it that she's a friend of the director, now being in 2 of his films, the other being Easy A, she is fantastic in these wacky parent roles. Speaking of Easy A, Emma Stone's cameo at the beginning of the film is priceless...... I was on the ground in stitches, I've been yelling ""John F**kin Mayer"" at random times ever since. Love Emma Stone!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>In closing, Friends With Benefits is a fun romp to be had with friends or your partner, it towers over NSA in spades. Well worth the price of admission. :)"

","I fully expected this movie to be ""No Strings Attached,"" only with much better casting. I could not have been more wrong. In fact, this film destroyed any expectations that I had preconceived. It was quite possibly the best romantic comedy or date movie I have seen in the past five years. Casting was certainly key and I can not see anyone except for Timberlake and Kunis portraying these characters.<br/><br/>Dylan (Timberlake) runs an extremely popular blog and is the perfect candidate to run the online editions of any magazine. Jamie (Kunis) is a corporate head hunter; someone who goes after specific job candidates on behalf of a company. She is hired by GQ to convince Dylan to take a high position with the magazine. After Dylan agrees to take the job and moves to New York he develops a kindred friendship with Jamie. Both characters realizing their need for carnal interaction; they decide to start just being ""friends with benefits."" Things become complicated as it is slowly revealed that Dylan tends to run away from hard situations. His father is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and it is made obvious that Dylan struggles to accept the hand that he has been dealt. Dylan's denial allows him to deny that he in fact has developed feelings for Jamie, who has also developed feelings for him. Long story short, it is Dylan's father who talks sense into him allowing Dylan to confess his feelings for Jamie. I walked away from the film feeling that the overall message conveyed is that 'life is tough so it is important to find happiness with the one that you love.' It is also worth noting that Woody Harrelson does an excellent job by providing a supporting role and comic relief. His character, Tommy, is the sports editor for the magazine and also a homosexual. He tends to be the vehicle that pushes the story along and helps to sugar coat some of the film's seriousness. I will say that the movie is sappy at times but the 'heart' mixes with the awkward story line in such a way that makes this movie work 8 Stars Out Of 10"
"jacobsfam-1","Null","2","5","30 July 2011"," Disappointing
","I was enjoying this film until the scene in the park. I was pretty surprised to hear Justin Timberlake's character in the film ask if someone who was starring at a tree was retarded. Mila Kunis was excited that maybe she found a nature lover in the park, yet Justin had to imply that the guy must be retarded. Justin Timberlake's character thought it was okay to mock the disabled by implying that people with special needs are hapless. I just don't get why Hollywood thinks it's okay to marginalize people with disabilities. People living with disabilities are individual as people without. What you call people is how you treat them."
"treeskier802","Null","2","5","29 July 2011"," Is This The Optimal Way To Date?
","I've decided to take a different spin on Friends With Benefits than most of the other reviews I've seen. Essentially Timberlake and Kunis' characters decide they are sick of the typical path that occurs when couples date. So they decide to be friends who simply have sex with no strings attached. This dating style allows the two to be completely honest with each other in what each likes and dislikes both sexually and personally. As it turns out, they become the perfect fit for each other. Unfortunately neither sees this and they consider dating other people because both feel what they are doing cannot last. I think for many people this is the best way to date! If you go into a relationship with the idea it will just be fun, you end up being yourself. You immediately get comfortably sexually, which can be intimidating if you gradually dated trying to get to know each other first.<br/><br/>As for the movie, the storyline was fresh and Timberlake and Kunis had great chemistry which is what you want out of a romantic comedy. A lot of the comedy poked fun at the stereotypical romantic comedy and then th movie when ahead and used those stereotypes to move the storyline ahead toward the end of the film...pretty genius actually. A great movie to watch with your significant other. Rating 7 of 10 stars."
"Christian_Dimartino","8","2","6","27 December 2011"," A decent romantic comedy.
","This has been a good year for Romantic comedy. In fact, it's the best year since 2009. In 2009, we had the great movie (500) days of Summer and the Sandra Bullock/ Ryan Reynolds rom-com The Proposal, both films that had a nice charm to it. This year, we've had one great(Midnight in Paris), one really good(Crazy Stupid love) and another good one, Friends with Benefits.<br/><br/>I was skeptical about it. Because this story plot has been used twice within a year. First, in 2010's Love and other drugs, a romantic dramady about a guy(Jake Gylenhaal), who works for a pill company, who meets a woman(Anne Hathaway) who has Parkinson's. It wasn't a great movie, but it was a well acted, sweet movie. Then following that, in January, we had No Strings attached, which was okay, but was nothing special. Now we have Friends with benefits, which beats them all.<br/><br/>The film revolves around two people(Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis) who have come to the conclusion that true love in movies is nothing like real life, and for that reason they start to sleep with each other, without dating and without feelings.<br/><br/>FWB is smart for a romantic comedy. It constantly pokes fun at romantic comedies like The Ugly Truth, and gives them justice. If they would've started bashing Woody Allen movies, then we would've had problems. But they don't, just the bad ones. It's smart, maybe not all the way fresh, but funny, and the two have great chemistry and it's fun to watch.<br/><br/>The film had me until the final act. Towards the final act, the film gets serious, which was just not right for this movie. I don't know, it just lost it's touch when it got serious. Even so, it's a very enjoyable romantic comedy none the less.<br/><br/>B+"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","2","6","28 July 2011"," Clever writing and genuine comedic acting help mask the inevitable clichés
","If I had the ability to time travel (and who's to say I don't, because I'd never tell you if I did) and felt inclined to show a movie to the citizens of the '20s or '30s that would fully capture for them life in the 21st Century because I wouldn't be able to take them there myself, I think I'd choose ""Friends with Benefits."" For one, it's predictable romance — that much hasn't changed in 80-90 years. For another, the presence of technology is rampant, which would awe them while also proving another thing that hasn't changed in 80-90 years: product placement. In all sincerity, however, Will Gluck (""Easy A"") has crafted yet another comedy that's savvy to its audience, and though the contemporary attitudes, humor and references come heavy-handed at times, he captures our sensibilities and can identify the talent that can make that writing work.<br/><br/>The only thing the screenplay doesn't write its way around is the formula to which the film's premise inextricably links itself. As funny and even touching as the writing can get, it can't outrun the predictability factor of two friends who try having a relationship built on emotionless sex. Dylan (Justin Timberlake) moves out to New York City from Los Angeles thanks to Jamie (Mila Kunis), a head hunter who sets him up at GQ. Knowing nobody in the Big Apple, Dylan spends a lot of time with Jamie and they connect over bad past relationships and some healthy sarcasm. Each plagued by their own issues, they determine they could try sex without feelings.<br/><br/>Yup, we know how this story goes; we even had a refresher course in January with ""No Strings Attached,"" a botched exercise to say the least. What that film lacked were (outside of Natalie Portman) the talents that ""Benefits"" has to sell us this recycled story as if brand new.<br/><br/>It's a tough sell, so any measure of success should be hailed a victory. For starters, Kunis and Timberlake are funny people — sincerely funny people. Undoubtedly improvisation was involved, but they understand the material and they make it natural and honest (as well as hilarious often times). Maybe more importantly, the supporting characters defy the norm of best friends and roommates. There's Woody Harrelson as a charismatic stereotype-breaking gay colleague of Dylan's at GQ, Patricia Clarkson as the free-wheeling and somewhat unmotherly mother to Jamie and other that pop up along the way. Certainly they only exist to provide the key advice necessary in these types of rom-coms, but their characters serve that purpose in fresher ways.<br/><br/>Although he didn't write ""Easy A,"" Gluck helped pen this film using similar techniques to try and subvert the rampant clichés. Much in the way that ""Easy A"" (which gets a shout out in the airport scene at the beginning if you watch closely) mixed modern humor with homage to teen comedies of the John Hughes variety, ""Friends with Benefits"" both honors romantic comedies and calls them out on their crap. Jamie is a hopeless romantic who despises the movies for warping her views on love and as she and Dylan drink beer and broach the subject of sex for the first time, they're even watching a rom-com, albeit a made-up one ""starring"" Jason Segel and Rashida Jones. The extra pinch of satire softens the fact that we all know even this film will descend into similar mushiness because that's what these movies do. The fact that we still embrace this obvious outcome speaks volumes to how well ""Friends with Benefits"" avoids being the awfulness its premise suggests.<br/><br/>Occasionally the film struggles to balance its excessive contemporary humor with moments of actual sincerity and a few characters and subplots (such as Dylan's family with his troubled father played by Richard Jenkins and his sister played by Jenna Elfman) though well done, feel out of place or unnecessary. Otherwise, the jokes hit and the sentimentality takes root as needed. Although I could've laughed half as much as I did at some of the jokes, the cast proves to make the difference in feeling the sting of some of the mediocre humor versus letting it slide.<br/><br/>~Steven C <br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","I have to say that watching ""Friends with Benefits"" is one feel good time of a watch! The film is very sexy and it's blended with humor and emotional attachment. And it showcases how more and more relationships have become and that is it's just all sex with no strings attached! That's something that most of us younger folk enjoy, still we get arguments that we all need love and relationships, yet this film proves that great sex alone can lead to attachment and the chance for love! This film even though it proves that romance can be obtained thru sex, it bucks the typical trend of Hollywood romantic comedies. It showcases plenty of fun loving erotic scenes of bed hopping and good old fashioned sex! In New York City Jamie(the hot and very sexy Mila Kunis)a young up and coming magazine executive who's just broken off a relationship hires a young hotshot from sunny California Dylan(Justin Timberlake who hams it up in this role)and this young stud is also single. It's upon his arrival to New York City the two hit it off and they agree from the start that this will only be a relationship of sex! The bed climbing eventually becomes tiresome, still it's fun and different from the norm you as the viewer will eat it up.<br/><br/>Good supporting turns are given along the way in the form of Tommy(Woody Harrelson)a gay magazine staff office worker, and veteran Patricia Clarkson is funny and sexy as Jamie's cougar and alcoholic mother Lorna, while TV actress Jenna Elfman is a bright smile as Dylan's big sister Annie. Along the way while dealing with family and relationship problems both Jamie and Dylan see that sex can lead to attachment then that grows to feelings and then a chance for love. This proves that having fun in the process gives anyone a chance for something special.<br/><br/>Many may take from this romantic/sex comedy that you learn as you go and that the benefits of sex are good it's a fun process. As it shows in the end it opens up a new beginning for a relationship of love and attachment. Now that's something we could all hope for and hopefully more sex and more bed hopping will lead to these kind of endings."

So, the movie is struck on saying and frankly declaring straight away and throughout the whole length of the movie that it will not follow the cliché way of boy meet girl and they fell in love because they are perfect for each other. But all things point that way and eventually the movie can't resist the super romantic clichés like declaration of love and desperate running to get the girl. Sure, there are some just friends scenes and the sex scenes do indicate that the two friends are simply enjoying themselves, but the way they complete each other and care for each other is simply controversial to the whole thing. If this was a movie that didn't identify itself as a unique and different movie , parting itself from the rest of the romantic comedies (the film even makes fun of them) then yes this would have been a nice movie, but the way it has been presented, well, it leads you to think that you'll see something different and you eventually won't.

"HelenMary","6","1","2","2 July 2012"," enjoyable romcom trying to be ironic about romcoms
","Olivier or Oscar worthy this is not. Enjoyable, likable and fun this most definitely is. Mila Kunis is the believable headhunter wanabe-happily-living-in-a-post-romcom-disillusion world, who falls in like with Justin Timberlake, the unlikely prince charming given his commitment issues. It's predictable, the trailer showed too much, and at times it's just a vehicle to show Justin's six-pack (I'm not complaining) against the back/front drop of the beautiful Kunis. Their chemistry is great, you liked them together, and that really added to the film's premise of the titular friends with their bedroom benefits.<br/><br/>It's not all silly, there were touching moments, the two leads dealing with family and life issues - wayward Mum and Dad with Alzeimer's - but there's a lot of genuine humour with some very clever writing and witty one-liners (some of which I'm pretty sure were Harrelson (playing gay sports writer at GQ) ad-libbing) and he brought superb comic-extra-relief with his ""strikily dickily"" rather sound but usually crude relationship advice.<br/><br/>This IS formulaic, of course, but it actually mocks that... narrates it, even. It's trying to do romcom ironically, and it works rather well... it's quite honest, and I liked that. Also beautiful shots of NYC and LA (*sigh*) to add lustre to a rather stylish well-groomed GQ-esque look to the film. I liked this a lot more than I expected to; was prepared to be ""meh!"" but actually wouldn't be averse to seeing it again. Maybe. If it came on TV."

I believe it says something about the movie when audience loose their aesthetic distance and start addressing the technical aspects. <br/><br/>Some characters come across as chopped off (Jamie's mother, the father). They had potential in my opinion. They could have been very charming if given enough space. Even Jamie (Mila) is quite obscured as a character, we know about her from others' report but we rarely see her development or actual change conveyed through acting instead of telling. <br/><br/>The city scenery is pleasing. <br/><br/>_____ my first movie review, sorry if it lacks."
"mistaphill-1","5","1","2","17 March 2012"," Ehh, it was OK
","Yes, I know it's a chick flick. But on a cross country flight, I had to pick something to watch on the airplane seat screen, and already saw Moneyball the first couple hours of the flight, so I gave this a try. I can't stand Justin Timberlake, and quite honestly he seems like another gay guy unsuccessfully trying to pass off as a straight guy, but Mila Kunis is still a hottie, so at least there's some eye candy. The movie is supposed to rip on romantic comedies, but quickly becomes the very thing it rips on. It gets quite predictable, and anyone in the audience could have written the ending for it. Also it's more than obvious that a few L.A. locations were trying to be passed off as New York (like the airport scenes). Overall not the worst movie ever, but pretty much forgettable."
"WatchedAllMovies","4","1","2","25 February 2012"," A typical Hollywood movie of this genre
","The movie gets a rating of 6.6 before I saw it, so I thought it would be decent. Unfortunately, this movie follows the same formula like many others before it. Two adults acting like immature teenagers. If they use actors that look like teenagers, it would at least be more believable.<br/><br/>Justin's acting is so-so. the lead actress is not that attractive and is heavily covered with eye makeups.<br/><br/>If you have not seen a ""friends having sex"" type of movie, this would be OK to watch.

"Donatien3","7","1","2","29 December 2011"," Funny but not ground-breaking
","Just when you thought the rom-com genre had fallen into a predictable pattern, 'Friends with Benefits' comes along to try and subvert this pattern. While it fails to do that, it's still an enjoyable film which isn't as mind-numbingly formulaic as your average rom-com.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis play Dylan and Jamie, two emotionally-damaged friends who start having no strings attached sex.<br/><br/>While the film does tread a predictable path, there's enough laughs – especially from Woody Harrelson (as Dylan's gay workmate) and Patricia Clarkson (Jamie's free-spirited mother) – to keep it fresh. There are also some touching moments, such as Dylan's dad's (Richard Jenkins) battle with Alzheimer's. There's even a funny rom-com movie- within-a-movie starring Jason Segel and Rashida Jones, which ticks all the rom-com cliché boxes.<br/><br/>My one biggest gripe of the film is their depiction of Dylan as a (recovered) stutterer. While explained away as a nervous childhood tic which was treated by a speech therapist, it comes back briefly during the helicopter rescue scene, then disappears. It seems to have been included to give Dylan some extra sympathy, but fails. His lack of basic math skills, by contrast, is much funnier.<br/><br/>While FWB isn't able to put the fresh spin on rom-coms that it planned, it's still an enjoyable films which rises above the usual dross this genre serves up."

","The faults of this movie slightly outweigh the good points. It tries to have an informative SATC type look at relationships. But it kind of feels silly more often. <br/><br/>Good points: Nice locations in NYC & LA beach. There is some chemistry between the leads. Patricia Clarkson is different in her hippy type role. Mila is pretty and okay to watch. The part with the father is quite touching. <br/><br/>There are some laughs here and there. <br/><br/>Bad Points: Too rushed dialog trying to jam in too many jokes in too short a space of time. The sex scenes are a bit like jack rabbits. Justin's voice is a bit high pitched and the singing is juvenile. The supporting cast are used kind of briefly and then discarded like Emma Stone. The screenplay could have been tightened and edited a bit.<br/><br/>Overall OK for one watch but not one of the better ones."

","This was a very 21st century movie. It seemed like it was trying too hard to avoid being cliché, but it just ended up being cliché with a twist. It was enjoyable to watch, and fun to see Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis in action. Above all, the soundtrack is awesome; just like the movie hints. The good thing about this movie that stands out against the rest of its kind is that there's more to it than the title implies. Most people have to learn the hard way in life; few save themselves in time. The ending credits were so much fun that I had to sit until the very end. They did a great job on this movie. Few romantic comedies nowadays have as much creativity as this movie does."
"cosmo_tiger","Null","1","2","24 October 2011"," A funny ""re-make"" of No Strings Attached that I didn't think was as good. I do like Portman better though. I say B
","""Are you asking me out? I mean, I'm the only friend you have in New York - you don't wanna complicate that."" When Dylan (Timberlake) is lured to New York for a job by Jamie (Kunis) they become friends. After a night of romantic comedy watching they begin to talk about how ""broken"" they are. After a deal is worked out they become ""Friends With Benefits"", but, predictably, that only makes things worse. The plot to this is almost the same as ""No Strings Attached"". After having seen that one, I didn't think this one was as good. Most of it probably has to do with the fact that I think Portman is hotter then Kunis though. Also No Strings felt less girlie to me, and I can't explain why. While Timberlake was pretty funny, and Woody Harrelson had some funny lines (but did tend to go over the top) the movie really seemed to drag for me. I did like the fact that the movie tried to make fun of all other romantic comedies (from dialog, to settings, to music) but I still got bored in parts. I think that, like me, when compared to ""No Strings Attached"" you will pick a favorite based on the main actors. That is because it basically the same movie. Much like ""Deep Impact"" & ""Armageddon"". Overall, a funny movie that is not as good as the ""original"". I give it a B.<br/><br/>*Also try - No Strings Attached"
"3xHCCH","4","1","2","3 October 2011"," Fornication is NOT cool
","I was very intrigued with Mila Kunis since I saw her in ""Black Swan."" Her portrayal of the new ballet dancer that threatened Natalie Portman was spot-on and riveting. I knew I would like to see her again in other films. And so, even as romantic comedies are not exactly my cup of tea, I watched ""Friends with Benefits.""<br/><br/>The movie started very well with Jamie (Mila Kunis) and Dylan (Justin Timberlake) breaking up with their respective SO's. That paved the way for big-time blogger Dylan to meet professional head-hunter Jamie in New York City so she can convince him to accept a job as an editor in GQ Magazine. The situation devolves from a nice smart friendship into an unconscionable purely sexual relationship. Of course, the rest of the film goes as the typical rom-com formula goes: boy meets girl, they fight and separate, then they get back together.<br/><br/>While Mila Kunis is so attractive and bubbly in her portrayal of Jamie, I was disappointed to see her in this kind of loose character. Still, Mia Kunis is the best part of this movie. I am a fan of this girl. On the other hand, Justin Timberlake seems to be playing the same type of guy in all his films. The Justin here seems to be the same cocky, fast- talking, sleazy Justin in the Facebook movie!<br/><br/>This film has got some remarkable supporting characters which divert our attention. Richard Jenkins as Dylan's dad with Alzheimer's was good, but seems out of place in this story. Jenna Elfman as Dylan's understanding sister was sweet. Patricia Clarkson as Jamie's hippy liberated mother was funny. Woody Harrelson as GQ's Sports Editor was hilarious in his few scenes.<br/><br/>For me, only the snappy dialogs and the perkiness of Mila Kunis save this movie. While I know that this type of ""sex-only"" arrangement exists in these hedonistic times, I do not particularly like to see this immoral situation ""glamorized"" on screen. Fornication is NOT cool."

"richard-s-bellamy","Null","1","2","20 September 2011"," Play on the romcom clichés
","The romcom genre is by nature a formulaic affair. Girl meets boy, chemistry, do they don't they, yes they do. Friends with Benefits tries to play on the formula in a self aware style. The film and its characters both know the disappointments of chasing the fairytale of true love. The couple initiate a friendship that the co-stars Timberlake and Kunis do with humour and a good turn of chemistry. To avoid the hardships of chasing love the story has them turn against love, thus creating the premise of the anti-romcom. This is of course a red herring. The couple fall in love despite themselves and it is an enjoyable journey to follow them.<br/><br/>The story exposes the characters flaws that inherently cause one person to connect deeper to another. The emotion that the couple attempt to remove from the relationship in favour of just sex, wins the day. Where the film does well is turning the conventions just a notch to show something reasonably fresh in a very clichéd genre. The film even mockingly plays on these clichés through a film within a film which Kunis as the die-hard romcom fan finds herself aspiring to in her own love life.<br/><br/>Friends with Benefits paints an amusing yarn of finding love where the characters actively chose to deny it. Gluck keeps it raunchy (see poster for example of possibly most suggestive gesture to find itself on a London bus), self aware and when needed shows the baggage the characters carry without it being over sentimental. The message seems to be that love, if you can find it with the right person, is the ultimate friends with benefits."
"Jackpollins","Null","1","2","27 July 2011"," The D**k in a box guy and Meg from Family Guy are ""Friends With Benefits""
","In early 2011, we got No Strings Attached, a film I liked, didn't love, may I remind you, but liked. Now, not much further down the road we get the exact same premise. Don't believe how similar the premises are? Well, this movie is called Friends With Benefits, and No Strings Attached's tag line was ""friendship has its benefits."" Now, you're probably wondering...as an overall romantic comedy..how does Friends With Benefits compare to No Strings Attached? Well...they're almost the same..almost. I liked, but didn't love both of them. That being said, Friends With Benefits is fairly smarter, funnier, and more touching than No Strings Attached. This fact probably comes from the fact that No Strings Attacked was much more puerile, albeit funny humor, while Friends With Benefits is more mature about its sense of humor. Now, that was the first part of my review. I'm sorry if people found it pointless for me to compare one movie to another, but they're kind of asking for it. The second part of my review will consist of Friends With Benefits as a movie on its own. Now, I got to say, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis work very well together. The chemistry is very fun here, and create a lot of raunchy laughs. That being said, Richard Jenkins as Justin Timberlake's father adds some much needed heart to the film, because you can't have a romantic comedy without having some heart. I also really liked Jenna Elfman as Timberlake's sister. That being said, there's such an unneeded amount of predictability and a lack of originality here. Overall, Friends With Benefits is a nice movie, whose central premise is not very original, but all the really solid performances and chemistry amongst its stars keep it afloat."
"blackmambamark","6","2","7","24 July 2011"," First half, funny......second half, giant chick flick cliché' trap.
","After seeing that pile of garbage that is ""No Strings Attached"", why on god's green earth would i see a movie that harbors the same concept. Well, ideas can be crapped on. Case in point, ""Batman and Robin"". Just because Joel Schumaker took a dump on my childhood doesn't mean the idea of Batman is still in the toilet. But can an idea as simple as this be somehow salvaged? I must admit, the movie did start off quiet entertaining. Both characters are likable, the dialog is witty and at times very funny, and the cameos are great. Needless to say, the direction this movie was taking was VERY different from ""No Buttholes Attached"". They made the sex portion of the film both hilarious and very sexy. The guys will love watching Mila Kunis strut around in next to nothing, and the girls will love the constant shots of Timberlake's ass. Combine that with the quirky awkward situations that we all encounter with sex, and you got a pretty humorous concept.<br/><br/>However, around the half way point of this film, it took a turn that i was hoping would never come. And that's what happens with the majority of these chick flick traps, they trick you with their humor, and they turn all emotional. And that's exactly what happened with this movie.<br/><br/>I mean come on, how can a film that's really witty and funny turn all serious in a blink of an eye? I mean, one second i'm laughing, and the next, i'm not forced to deal with the sad situation with Timberlake's father having Alzheimer's. Then it trickles down even more when Kunis overhears Timberlake's feelings about her, and of course, the movie gets all emotional and turned into ""No Poop Bombs Attached"".<br/><br/>By this point of the movie, i gave up all hope. I already knew what was coming. I was bored, and i actually took a phone call in the theater, which is something i never, and i do mean NEVER do.<br/><br/>Bottom Line.....like i already said before, the first half was funny, witty and clever. And the second half is a giant chick flick cliché' trap. I didn't hear one laugh or chuckle in the theater for the remaining hour of the film. But the ladies will probably love it."

","A couple days ago, I was lucky enough to attend an early screening of the new romantic comedy, Friends With Benefits.<br/><br/>In the film, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis play Dylan and Jamie. Dylan is a businessman in LA recruited to work for GQ magazine in New York, and Jamie is a co-worker who shows him the ropes or New York. They're both just getting out of shaky relationships, and have become fed up with the concept of true love. While mocking the typical rom-com clichés of a movie they watch one night. They decide to make a plan to add sex to their friendship, with the intention that it doesn't lead to complications. But, as cliché would have it, adding sex to friendship does lead to complications between Dylan and Jamie.<br/><br/>The movie has kind of the same idea as No Strings Attached, a movie released earlier in the year, and even though we did not need two of these movies, I will say Friends With Benefits is a better movie. It's not great, it's just that I found No Strings Attached to be so dull, Friends With Benefits just gets more things right.<br/><br/>The screenplay is pretty straightforward, but I liked how it would poke fun at the clichés of romantic comedies, and then would use those for its comedic advantage later on. The movie is predictable, and it goes on a little longer than it needs to, but that was something I could overlook, because the film had me laughing the whole way through.<br/><br/>At the very least, the cast is right. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are hilarious in the movie, and they share great, and sometimes steamy chemistry. They both have a bit to be desired, but their charm, especially that of Kunis, makes that forgivable. There are also some laugh out loud supporting roles by Patricia Clarkson and Woody Harrelson, and a brief, but awesome cameo by Emma Stone in the film's first few minutes.<br/><br/>But the movie does still tend to shake in tone, and every so often, there's a rare joke that doesn't work.<br/><br/>Friends With Benefits is ALMOST a good movie, but it'll sadly have to settle at **1/2 out of ****, subject to change upon possible rewatch."

Confusing cinema goers making them rack their brains trying to decide on a film!<br/><br/>Here are a few examples to prove my point:<br/><br/><ul><li>Killers vs. Knight &amp; Day (2010)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dante's Peak vs. Volcano (1997)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Prestige vs. the Illusionist (2006)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A Bugs Life vs. Antz (1998)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Deep Impact vs. Armageddon (1998)</li></ul><br/><br/>Coincidence? I think not! But from looking at those titles, there's always one that's better quality than the other. And if you're trying to decide which one is worth your time. Let me help you make that decision. <br/><br/>Both 'No Strings Attached' & 'Friends With Benefits' are typical and predictable, definitely something for the ladies. Both portray a modern female character who are empowering and career focused & don't want a serious relationship. But we can all guess what happens at the end, women hormones and emotions take over. <br/><br/>But if we're going to compare the pair, 'No Strings attached' takes the cake hands down. The film's script takes on a much wittier approach and gave me a few chuckles and giggles. At the same time there were scenes that got me a little choked up. It was a good mix of comedy and romance like the genre suggests. <br/><br/>Not to mention Kutcher and Portman who were portraying these typical characters, seem to have more chemistry and didn't make my skin crawl. Even the older wiser character in both films, played by Kline (Adam's Father) had more of a distinct characteristic and was flawed and funny as oppose to the 'Friends with Benefits' counterpart played by Clarkson (Jamie's mother) who's character failed to even resonate in my memory.<br/><br/>'Friends with Benefits' is a Justin Timberlake fans only film. Mila and Justin made a good effort, but if you're looking for a film with a typical plot that would make you laugh and cry. You'd be better off checking out Reitman's 'No Strings Attached' attempt. <br/><br/>Even though the 'No Strings attached' tag line appears to be directly ripping off 'Friends with Benefits'. How I see it is, if you're going to do something that's been overdone and clichéd. Then do it well. And 'No Strings Attached' did just that"
"Danusha_Goska","Null","1","3","17 August 2011"," Surprisingly Good. Restores Faith in Romantic Comedies. Worth Seeing
","""Friends with Benefits"" has a lightning fast, very smart script, it moves like a limousine, and it features another stunningly moving character turn by Richard Jenkins. It's good enough that it revives hope for that troubled genre, the Romantic Comedy. It's worth seeing, more than once. <br/><br/>""Friends with Benefits"" surprised me. I don't understand why Justin Timberlake is famous – what is remarkable about him, really? – and Mila Kunis does nothing for me. We live in the age of decline of the Romantic Comedy. ""Friends with Benefits"" was not the forgettable, rote, mass- produced studio product I expected. It was actually really good. <br/><br/>""Friends with Benefits"" began really fast, and I found myself bobbing along on the script's energy. I noticed how much I was enjoying it and I kept waiting for the film to drop the ball, to let me down, to betray itself, to fall into predictable clichéd traps. That didn't happen for quite a while, and the film's failings were slow in coming, minor, and didn't ruin the film. <br/><br/>What ""Friends with Benefits"" does right it does very, very right. The script is amazing. There are jokes that you'd need some literacy and maturity to understand. They fly right by, no pause for the viewer to laugh, or to google the references, before the next one-liner or trenchant observation rolls down the chute. Our culture has been so dumbed down that hearing a joke that one would have to have some knowledge of history or culture or even just the front page of the newspaper to understand amazed and gratified me. <br/><br/>The movie's strong point is that it is so fast; that's also a bit of a weak point. Legendary director Frank Capra said that ""sometimes your story has to stop and you just let your audience look at your people. You want your audience to like themthese scenes are quite important to a film. When the audience rests and they look at the people, they begin to smile."" ""Friends with Benefits"" is so frenetic, it never creates a memorable screen moment where Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (Mila Kunis) do nothing but look movie-star lovely and get under our skin. <br/><br/>Richard Jenkins works some powerful mojo. He's a character actor, older, bland-looking and bald, but in every movie I've seen him in lately, especially so in ""Eat Pray Love,"" he seems to be visiting from a different, better movie, and I want, after the movie I'm watching is over, to watch the superior film from which Jenkins has visited. In ""Friends with Benefits"" Jenkins plays Dylan's father who is suffering the early stages of Alzheimer's. He is funny, profound, arresting and truly lovable. What is Jenkins doing? Whatever it is, more actors should do it. <br/><br/>Jenna Elfman, Patricia Clarkson, Woody Harrelson, Nolan Gould and Masi Oka are all very, very good in supporting roles. Clarkson, as Jamie's mother, delivers a liner about Jamie's father that made me laugh out loud. <br/><br/>On the surface, ""Friends with Benefits"" looks like too many other, lesser movies. It's not. It's a really good, worthwhile film."

","Young urban professionals Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake become friends after Kunis (a corporate headhunter) recruits Timberlake (a high-class magazine editor) to New York City to take a job with magazine giant GQ (Gentleman's Quarterly). Their friendship blossoms as both are discontented with failed romances. Thus they decide to have a physical relationship which is meant to avoid complications and complexities of would-be deeper emotional bonds. Of course we all know this will be a recipe for all kinds of turmoil and conflict which will ultimately develop between our two leads. ""Friends With Benefits"" makes itself out to be a revolutionary addition to the romantic genre, but in the end it is just as predictable as dozens of its type. Kunis and Timberlake make for an interesting pairing, but their chemistry is more sporadic than it is sizzling. Richard Jenkins gives one of his finest performances as Timberlake's father who is experiencing the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, but his appearance (along with daughter Jenna Elfman) is too late and really becomes too much of a side-story that the audience does not necessarily need (I think I would have rather had a film where Jenkins' character was the focus). Patricia Clarkson is loopy and in the way as Kunis' 1970s-obsessed mother who throws out everything verbally except words of wisdom. She is almost like Kunis' daughter instead of the other way around. Also along for the ride is gay sports editor Woody Harrelson who comes around Timberlake with would-be hilarious one-liners and distorted views about relationships and life in general. Harrelson's character, like Clarkson's, was probably not needed at all in the final analysis. Tiring clichés, an interminable running time, weakly-drawn characters, and stupid gimmicks (the recurring flash mobs in particular) cause ""Friends With Benefits"" to collapse by its final resolution. 2.5 out of 5 stars."
"crystal_finlay","Null","1","3","31 July 2011"," A modern comedy about casual sex
","Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (Mila Kunis) are two beautiful, young, and charming individuals who fall in love under the most unconventional circumstances in the summer flick, ""Friends with Benefits."" During the process of recruiting Dylan to join a New York based magazine, Jamie shows Dylan some of New York's most famous attractions all while the two spark an innocent yet adventurous friendship. As the title alludes, the two confess their physical attraction to one another and swear to have casual sex without emotional commitment whatsoever. As they spend more time with each other and get to know the other better, they soon discover that their sexual routine changes their friendship for the worse.<br/><br/>In addition to the modern sexual overtones of the script ""Friends with Benefits"" captures the aesthetic values of New York City's bustling culture, diverse attitudes, and breath taking scenes. Early into the film, Jamie confidently declares that she is going to ""sell"" Dylan on ""New York"" and in doing so introduces him to the endless choices of eateries, rooftops of sky scrappers, and flash-mob routines in the middle of Time Square. How could Dylan resist? He is convinced to walk away from his life as a blogger in Los Angeles and take a job in a huge city where he knows one person- Jamie who has to be one the friendliest and most social people that the city has to offer. He doesn't want to admit it but her personality knocks him off his feet and he spends most of his time trying to convince himself that their relationship must remain confined to their ""friends with benefits"" status which gets more entertaining as the film progresses. Its very hard not to fall in love with this duo as friends or as lovers who want more but don't know how to uncomplicated things.<br/><br/>The supporting cast accounts for a number of the film's laughs. Lorna (Jamie's mother played by Patricia Clarckson) is the complete opposite of her career-driven mother. She binge drinks, sleeps around uncontrollably, and fears stability. Tommy (Woody Harrelson) is a gay sports editor at Dylan's magazine who prides himself upon being ""strictly dickly"" although he admires women as being superior to men. Go figure.<br/><br/>""Friends with Benefits"" is a modern, raunchy yet tasteful romantic comedy about two confused people who struggle to maintain the status quo of how their relationship should develop and their endearing feelings for one another. It gets a rating of 7 out of 10."
"TheHrunting","Null","1","3","27 July 2011"," Hypocritic oath
","This is a romantic comedy on the candid side that attempts to evenly round up both the female/male viewer by throwing out some honest, self-depreciating jokes about the sometimes awkward and frustrating aspects of what either side goes through when dating and attempting to secure a steady relationship. ""Friends with Benefits"" is an unchallenging film that comes across more as a spoof of other contrived rom-coms while still managing to fall into a few of the trappings and part of the formula itself the more involved it gets.<br/><br/>This is by no means quintessential and it's hard to say if it tackles the promiscuous question any better than ""No Strings Attached"" as they don't always take themselves very seriously but are more for brisk and painless recreation instead. ""Friends (with Benefits),"" the indy flick from 2009, answered a little more about the debatable question. The main difference between the recent ""NSA,"" is it had one side who felt more attached than the other and previously they were more acquaintances than friends. All three seem like different experiences in their own little ways, but where both ""FwB"" 2011 and ""NSA"" borrowed off of ""F (wB)"" 2009 was they all start off as silly comedies and then revert back to a similar rom-com template, not to mention all boil down to emotions that everyone was trying to suppress. Now that a template is officially established, hopefully this is the last of 'em.<br/><br/>This has a very loosely laid out plot that instead of going for layer upon layer keeps it simple by concentrating on character development, leaving ample room to evaluate emotions and coming with little recognizable patterns throughout in the meantime that looks at their on-the-fly lives in the city and charismatic friends and family members. There's the premise: they go through unserious and unreasonable dates, then meet through business--Dylan (Timberlake) is from L.A., Jamie (Kunis) is from N.Y., now he moves to N.Y.--they become close friends and, of course, they're done with the emotional side of sex, hence they should be friends with benefits. Problem solved! Not exactly. Both are still romantics at heart even though they try and hide their emotions so they don't get hurt again with Jamie being a blunt, cursing New Yorker, and Dylan avoiding talking about private issues when confronted. They try and keep it cut and dry or as a ""tennis match,"" but if it wasn't inevitable enough start to grow onto each other. They want to keep the friendship, so both date outside but confusion sets in if they should go back and further the connective bond they had.<br/><br/>From what at first has them yelling out calculated directions of how to please one another like a business transaction, this turns into some believable chemistry between Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake with some spontaneity thrown in to give them some natural interaction. This comes with lots of undergarment shots, a few butts, as well as plenty of bedroom banter that only holds back in showing the full detail. Shaun White shows up as the token and somewhat pointless antagonist who's nice to everyone else but chides on Dylan because he had a thing with Jamie prior. Woody Harrelson plays the proud and macho gay friend Tommy who's got a thing for sports. Harrelson tries a little too hard, but still manages to keep one's undivided attention whenever he enters the screen just for what he'll say next. Patricia Clarkson--from ""Easy A""--plays Jamie's irresponsible mom Lorna who goes through more men than floss and has some pretty humorous lines despite not being the perfect role model.<br/><br/>Everybody seems to be checked out when it comes to steady relationships, including Dylan's father (Richard Jenkins) who's going through Alzheimers but wishes the mother was still around and that he actually went after a former crush. This causes Jamie and Dylan to reevaluate what they had, despite the flaws and hangups, and the film from having rapid edits and quick quips in the beginning starts to eventually ramble on and turn a tad bit long so it can avoid falling into a clichÃ© and sappy closer, which it nearly does so anyway. Who are they fooling? Even though some of the humor and serious subjects don't always mix at this stage, it was still somewhat mushy, easy fun that's perfect enjoyment for a date night or a relaxing nothing-to-do day. ""FwB"" doesn't necessarily answer any questions as it shows more than it tells, but when it concludes still comes with a few relating puns and jabs at what people go through just to find the right person, or who that right person actually will be outside of our preconceived notions. I guess there's hope even for the ones who want to cut to the chase and eliminate all those courtship rules. (Also submitted on Cinema Freaks, http://docuniverse.blogspot.com)"

"bopdog","10","2","10","24 July 2011"," Deft and engaging. Brilliant cast delivers the perfect tone. I loved this movie!
","Very pleasant surprise! I enjoyed this film. I knew I was heading into a rom-com, of course. Often rom-coms have at least some major element of what I can only call ""the stupid"". Maybe a supporting character is so lame or even unsavoury that it detracts from the overall integrity of the movie. Or perhaps, in some cases, the plot hinges on events that aren't even just theatrical (after all, all films are ""fake"" and theatrical), but so contrived and removed from life as to be just plain silly. Or stupid.<br/><br/>The only criticism of the movie I have, and it is a minor quibble, I guess--- I never understood what the Shaun White character was doing in the movie. Minor spoiler: I kept waiting for him to be a catalyst for something, but all the writers had him do was act yobbish and odious. Shaun White is a lovely and admirable man in real life- so what was the object of his ""fictional"" appearance in this film? Dunno... Maybe it was funnier or more interesting on paper? But aside from that odd bit of character insertion, everything else was pitch perfect.<br/><br/>This movie felt solid and real all the way down to every character, each scene, and right up to the end. Please understand I am granting a ""theatre"" realism to it, not a ""how my actual life goes"" realism. But isn't it just so that we have some stories we tell ourselves, both for solace for our disappointments, and for inspiration and maybe even guidance for how we'd like to live our lives? In that latter case we'd call the stories ""inspirational"".<br/><br/>""Friends With Benefits"" was also like that latter case. it is a fantasy, to be sure. We aren't meant to take it as a documentary. But there are many levels of greatness amongst stories and fantasies, and this movie had th best quality of art. It was the best kind of fantasy- it spoke to me on deep and true levels, it uplifted me and yes, as clichÃ© and hippie as it may sound, it also inspired me.<br/><br/>The actors were perfectly cast. I've always liked Mila Kunis- but here she shows up as a powerful actor with a wonderful playful nature that wins her friends in any audience. Justine Timberlake- I must confess I always kind of thought he was a poser, producing music that pretended to be ""all street"" and whatnot. But i was proved wrong here, and am glad of it. he was sympathetic and engaging. Both the leads were people I could identify with, and cheer on.<br/><br/>Patricia Clarkson was pitch-perfect. her role as the wacky mother could easily have turned into a cringe-worthy cartoon of ""an old drunk broad"" who still lives in her salad days, in lesser hands. Clarkson was human and warm and likable- a master acting job, and a master class in the deft touch with perfect tone.<br/><br/>Jenna Elfman was also a pleasant surprise--- I remember her well from the likable TV fluff ""Dharma and Greg"", and a few roles in the likes of the Edward Norton directorial movie 10 years or so ago. Kind of ""sharp,"" then. here she seems to have matured into a very likable and strong woman. Her character felt sensible, essential to the story, and loving. That was very nice to see.<br/><br/>Overall, every character appeared for just right amount of time. No character over-stayed their welcome or purpose. Even keeping the adorable and amazing Emma Stone down to just a few too-brief scenes was, in the end, probably a smart move on the director's part. Any more would have been distracting. It was all just right!"

Huge mistake. The movie was raunchy and totally predictable, it wasn't the least bit funny, and there was no chemistry at all between the lead actors (due in part to the fact that JT doesn't talk or act like a heterosexual).<br/><br/>Seriously, is this what passes for a romantic comedy nowadays?. I wanted to kick myself for wasting 2 hours watching this garbage, when I would've MUCH rather watched When Harry Met Sally for the 7th or 8th time.

"katyushka06","8","1","4","28 August 2011"," The best romantic comedy of this summer
","Films on such tricky subject, when two lonely hearts meet each other and decide to refuse having serious relationships and mutually agree to experiment what it's like to be just sex friends recently came out in the cinemas so we can compare and contrast . By playing main characters' feelings and intentionally getting them into this game it seems like directors try hard to show us that such experiment is bound to fail. And it is, surely, a perfect version, because everyone is alive, let us not forget that it's only a movie, but we have evident example of what happens if we try to go against nature.<br/><br/>In spite of the original scene â€“ New York again, and little banality of the plot, everything is given lively and comparatively new. Because the main thing is how to present and this is the key to success. And to present the movie as good as possible and give it out as something individual the creators used techniques that allow separating this comedy from variety of movies of this kind. Dilan (Justin Timberlake) moves to New York to become art director of a famous magazine. That's when Mila Kunis' character appears and becomes a guide for him (and for us, of course) in the city that never sleeps. So we can praise the director even for the opportunity to fall in love with night New York over 15 minutes. Flash mob idea deserves particular attention, because prepares us for the further watching and in some way leads us, giving the opportunity to feel what we are going to see next and how we should receive it.<br/><br/>A couple of Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake look fresh. Undoubtedly, new faces breathed new life into this kind of movie, yet it is still possible and we are not tired of Justin's curls. Preconception of his actor career can be explained, but is unjust. Justin, even if it sounds strange, stands out against a background of all these former pop singers who decided to try themselves in something new. What's the secret? Maybe his charisma, maybe really good acting. And who knows, maybe both. Anyway, he is quite good looking. At least, he manages well in a comic genre.<br/><br/>What exactly characterizes this movie from its previous related neighbors is easy and unstressed narration. But even this is not everlasting. Though characters make fun of this over-dramatization in the cheap romantic movies with happy endings, for classic melodramas it is an irreplaceable element, and finally the films gets its drama, gradually adding tragedy as it is supposed to be. On the other hand, it is presented not as sweet as it could be if we talk about classic romantic comedies, but with a sense of humor and satire. There are certain clichÃ©s that are necessary to be done.<br/><br/>As a result we have an excellent summer comedy, a little vulgar, a little cynical, but all in all it is pleasant to say that creators didn't stress much on drama, but expressed the main idea without using strong morality."
"jonnyhavey","Null","1","4","25 July 2011"," ""Contemporarily Relevant: The Sex Buddy Disparity""
","""Contemporarily Relevant: The Sex Buddy Disparity"" ""No Strings Attached 2""? No, it is another film about a couple of people trying to make an emotionless relationship based around sex work; Natalie Portman's ""Black Swan"" costar just happens to be in it. Director Will Gluck's (""Easy A"") ""Friends With Benefits"" is a better disparity of the sex buddy concept than the aforementioned because of its array of genuine characters starting with Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. Dyan (Justin Timberlake, ""The Social network"") works as an art director of an online media company (my dream job) in California and has just been dumped by his girl friend Kayla (Emma Stone, ""Easy A""). The other player, Jamie (Mila Kunis, ""Book of Eli"") is a headhunter in New York that has also been dumped by her boyfriend Quincy (Andy Samberg, ""I Love You Man""). Dyan was ""emotionally unavailable"" while Jamie was ""emotionally damaged"" making them the perfect match when Jamie meets Dylan at the airport to facilitate his job offer with a nation renowned magazine. Dylan inevitably takes the job and with one friend in New York to turn to, Dylan and Jamie become really close. As the sexual tension builds, they make fun of a clichÃ© Jason Segel (""Bad Teacher"") and Rashida Jones (""The Social Network"") rom-com and embark on an emotion free series ofsexual escapades. The relationship becomes much more as they begin to open up to each other transforming the happy-go-lucky comedy into a dramatic (but not overly dramatic) conclusion with splendid performances by Richard Jenkins (""Hall Pass""), Patricia Clarkson (""Easy A"") and Woody Harrelson (""Zombieland"").<br/><br/>The coolest part of the film is that everything from its lingo to the character's jobs and even the credits give the film a relevant contemporary feel. Also, while the characters are goofy, they have a lot of heart making the film's conclusion clichely fulfilling and allowing the cast to fluently connect with the audience. The chemistry between all of which makes the movie feel unscripted, making Timberlake and Kunis into a naturally perfect on screen matchup. Timberlake and Kunis must step aside, as Richard Jenkins runs away with his authentic portrayal of a man suffering from Alzheimer's that will make you laugh and cry (especially for one like me who works at an Alzheimer's and Dementia home).<br/><br/>Everything bad about the film is self-explanatory because if you are expecting a genre defining rom-com without a predictable ending, you have been misled. While, Director Glick follows suit of ""Easy A"", making fun of the genre, in the end there really isn't much more he could do. The genre is fixed, and can be very repetitive leaving too much room for pointless moments. ""Friends With Benefits"" seems to avoid space filling jokes most of the time, but still lets moments like the unnecessary Sean White cameo overstay their welcome.<br/><br/>Romantic Comedies have not changed much at all over the years, but if you are looking for a film that is current and has praiseworthy actors embodying genuine characters, ""Friends With Benefits"" is the fun and true solution."

"iheart_ny","10","1","5","26 August 2011"," At least ten times better than No Strings Attached
","This has been a magical summer for movies. A lot of movies that I was really looking forward to, have turned out to be lousy. However, I've seen a lot of movies that I expected to be awful, but ended up being really good. Thus, ""Friends With Benefits"". Romantic comedies are always awful for me. I love them, but they make me feel like crap. The reason why this is, is because most of them are dishonest, and make you feel like only in the movies, things work out in love. ""Friends With Benefits"" is refreshingly honest, kind of sad, yet hopelessly optimistic. Its dialogue is fast and quick, kind of ""Juno""-esque. <br/><br/>Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake are both coming off Oscar roles. Justin Timberlake was surprisingly good in ""The Social Network"", as was Kunis in ""Black Swan"". Maybe it was a fluke that both of them were so good in those movies, but this is the kind of movie they belong in. Their characters, Dylan and Jamie, have personalities, and characteristics that mesh with each other in a really awesome way, which doesn't come very often in romantic comedies.<br/><br/>The story, as for most romantic comedies, isn't surprising at all. It's two people who are coming out of bad relationships, who meet in a classic cute romantic comedy way, and decide that relationships don't work out, and to remain ""friends with benefits"", or friends who (constantly) have sex. As you could imagine, this doesn't work out the way they had hoped. There was a similar movie released this January, with Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher called ""No Strings Attached"", which, clearly will be referenced in most, if not all reviews for ""Friends With Benefits"". I, admittedly, didn't hate that movie. But it's a piece of dreck compared to this one.<br/><br/>It's a typical hour-and-forty-five minute romantic comedy. However, it's kind of this generation's ""When Harry Met Sally"". It's ""When Dylan Met Jamie"". The two leads are so great with each other, one the yin to the other's yang. You can tell that they would be conceivable as a real couple. They aren't the perfect, immediately compatible couple that usually headlines a movie such as this. Justin Timberlake keeps proving that he's a better actor than a lot of pop stars. He's insanely likable in this movie. Mila Kunis had a smaller, haunting kind of role in ""Black Swan"", where I thought she was above average. She's really allowed to shine in this one, bringing life to a character that could have been much less. The attitude of this movie is sometimes gritty, always quick, witty, and urban. It makes good use of the time it's given. It acknowledges the ridiculous romantic comedies that it could have been. Jamie and her friend, at one point, walk by a poster for Katherine Heigl's ""The Ugly Truth"", and says ""Shut up, Katherine Heigl! You stupid liar!"". A fake in-movie-movie, with Rashida Jones and Jason Segel, is meant to emphasize how ridiculous most romantic comedies are. Great stuff.<br/><br/>Another thing this one has that ""No Strings Attached"" didn't have is a great supporting cast. Patricia Clarkson plays Jamie's mother, a hippie lush who is really damn funny. Woody Harrelson also does a good job as Dylan's unapologetically bold and hilarious gay boss. He gets kudos for not making a gay character a stereotype. Richard Jenkins plays Dylan's Alzheimer's stricken father, and Jenna Elfman plays his sister. They add to the quick and zippy feel of the movie. Cameos by Emma Stone and Andy Samberg are always welcome, too.<br/><br/>While some probably won't like this one as much as I did, I liked all of its characters. I felt like each character was well-developed and interesting. The quick writing is what makes it better than a lot of similar movies, but when everything in it is mashed together, the whole package is very good. I look forward to watching it again.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

It's a happy little feel-good movie, and certainly nothing more. However, what makes it so good is that the film knows that. It never pretends to be something it's not, and pokes fun at all the clichÃ©s it harbors.

The movie drags a bit at times, it slows down and you really don't want it too, so that's one issue. The sex scenes are comical and hot, and they work for this film.

","Friends with Benefits does not redefine the tried and tested rom-com formula. It is pretty much the same as any of the other movies from this genre. However, the lead actors Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis have a mesmerizing chemistry which makes the movie really watchable. The writing is crisp and witty. The story is about two people who decide to have sex without getting in a relationship. However, they eventually develop feelings for each other without admitting it. The film separates itself from the bunch by being self-conscious as the leads repeatedly mention the fact that their story is similar to a Hollywood movie. However, some of the melodrama seems contrived when everything seemed to be going perfectly well between the two. Mila Kunis shines in this movie and is extremely likable. Watch it for the chemistry and sharp dialog."

","Friends With Benefits was definitely fun, and it was what I was expecting. And yes, of course it was easily predictable, but what kind of romantic comedy isn't? Friends With Benefits was mostly simple and fun, easy to watch.<br/><br/>Most of the sex scenes are very good, they weren't made too deep nor were they just physical action which would make you awkward, hoping nobody enters the room. It was realistic and showed how fun sex can be with the real person, which is something movies don't usually show you. Movies just try to glamorize sex way too much, in Friends With Benefits it was very casual.<br/><br/>I'm not so sure about Justin Timberlake's acting though. He seemed decent, but not particularly good. Mila Kunis however, is brilliant and funny as always. Also she's gorgeous, which makes the movie easier to watch.<br/><br/>I was kind of hoping more from Woody Harrelson's character, but every time he opens his mouth, they just had to point out how gay the character is. I think the audience got it after the first time yet still it needs to be said so many times it felt like the only feature the character had. Sexual minorities need much better representation than this. <br/><br/>The whole story felt like it would be making fun of them, but still they ended up using them. I can't decide if the movie was ironically playing with the clichés or if it fell into its own trap.<br/><br/>Friends With Benefits is fun, but I can't imagine watching it a second time. There are way better romantic comedies, like Keeping The Faith, but sure it's worth one watch."

Personally I was waiting to see her in movie like this from ""That '70s Show"" because her potential was underrated and positive energy she gives not used as should be.<br/><br/>Watch this movie, you are going to remember it.

","This movie is VERY attractive to look at. You have two attractive lead actors and some breathtaking cinematography as well as beautiful scenery. The major problem with this movie is that IT doesn't know what it is, so how can we know what it is?<br/><br/>What I mean is that this movie fails to be a comedy and a drama. It's also not a ""dramedy,"" it's just a mess. The jokes fall so flat, it's not even funny. The first joke is about the pilot who landed the plane on the Hudson River...Not funny at all, offensive really. Then comes Woody Harrelson (awesome actor) who's talent is wasted on playing a stereotypical flamboyant gay guy who also makes unfunny jokes. Anywho the jokes fall so flat that you can't consider it a comedy. Surely it must be a drama then, right? WRONG. Any dramatic tension that could possibly build up is ruined by awful acting. Seriously, none of these actors have any chemistry; terrible casting. Whether it be the two leads or the supporting actors, they have absolutely no ability to feed off of each others' performances. <br/><br/>Aside from the bad acting and confusion in the movie's intent, it's just a tired idea. Whether it be the original ""Harry Met Sally"" or ""No Strings Attached (another, even worse movie) this idea of exploring a no strings attached sexual relationship has been done many, many times and much better. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, but it's just not very good."

","... Friends with Benefits can't run fast enough into the very clichés it wants to make fun of. It is like a producer is steering the project into the tightly packaged product zone while he had writers with more creativity than was allowed/needed.<br/><br/>The crisp dialogue is really what makes the movie stand out IMO since I would not say that the chemistry between Milla Kunis and Justin Timberlake is more than adequate. Actually the setback of this crisp dialogue is the fast delivery and the impression of having fast delivery puppets rather than fine characters. That is a directorial issue: how to keep a fine comedic pace without letting down the characters in stand-up gig mode? I appreciated the script was somewhat original in the background but the LA sequence, which should have been the high point, is a ridiculous let down full of stock characters/situations and comedic action bogged down in the middle. From there ending is painfully dragging its feet.<br/><br/>Not bad, has fine creative inroads, but never quite makes it above the level of a very conservatively clichéd RomCom."
"bp-pavankumar786","Null","0","2","26 December 2013"," Feel good but ends quickly
","Justin and mila action is good but their chemistry is exceptional despite e fast ending could have extending more.overall its a go od movie except the film comes to a screeching halt just about halfway in when Jamie and Dylan come to the all too obvious realization that they may want something more. The film then becomes drastically more dramatic, a lot less sweet, and significantly more ordinary. Even the laughs suffer, landing less with a snicker and more with a groan. Everything it does to shift itself away from the romantic comedy genre feels wasted because it falls into all of the stereotypes quicker than it poked fun at them. It almost feels like they wanted to desperately feel different, and then decided to just go the safer route as opposed to sticking with its offbeat early tactics. I was really enjoying the film significantly more than I imagined, but suddenly felt bored and totally thrown off by the drastic tonal shift.<br/><br/>While sketch comedy has proved to be one of his strong suits, Timberlake seems to have a lot of trouble carrying the film. We know he has the chops to command the screen and be absolutely magnetic (we have David Fincher and The Social Network to thank for that), but here he seems to be struggling with every other scene. He lands most of his jokes well, does decently with the dramatic bits and has plenty of chemistry with Kunis, but he lacks the spark I think most people will expect him to have in this role. He comes off as just okay, and more amateur than anything else. He would have been better suited in the film as a key supporting player, as opposed to the lead.<br/><br/>Kunis on the other hand, is significantly stronger and proves that her turn in Forgetting Sarah Marshall may have been an early suggestion of the formidable comedic talent she may quickly become. Gluck is not able to achieve the same level of breakthrough that he got from Emma Stone in Easy A from Kunis, but she manages to carry the film almost single handedly. Even at the script's weakest moments, she grins and pushes forward, never once appearing to be struggling as much as Timberlake does. I think my only complaint against her is that she spends a good portion of the film completely nude, yet ends up wearing all too obvious pasties under a white shirt in one scene. It seems more like a complaint against a horrendously bad editing and lighting decision than against her, but it was a scene that made her seemingly-realistic character feel a whole lot less believable. overall its a good movie."
"ormessi","7","0","3","14 November 2013"," Shallow but charming romantic comedy
","So ""FREINDS WITH BENEFITS"" gives us a very typical new york love story, and as usual, the way to the love is not so easy. Lets start with the plot, we have Dylan, the shy an handsome young man from LA who made his way to the NYC. The man who takes this place is no other then Justin Timberlake, who did a perfect job as the young charming and horny young man that as the movie goes on appeared as a sensitive boy with a complicated family background. The movie started with Dylan getting a job offer in new york, he came to the big city, there he feels unconnected. But he has Jamie, a ""had hunter"" who helped him during his first days in the city and soon became his best friend. Our Jamie is the lovely and supper sexy Mila Kunis, Jamie is the urban new york girl with hopes to ""Hollywood style true love"", she defines herself emotional defective and a lot of her problems comes from her ""special"" mother (Patricia Clarkson). Dylan and Jamie are lonely, and misses sex so they decided to start an unemotional relationship, based on sex only, from now on you're about to have a really good time with Jamie and Dylan's hilarious and sexy adventure. Now let's take a look at all the aspects of the movie, the story of this movie is far from being unique, I think that after 15-20 minutes every one can see how the end is going to look like, but the main actors are pretty good and they take this ordinary plot to a young and wild place. I also like the presenting of Dylan's family and their issues, which gave this movie another measure, a deeper one. So let's make it short, this movie is the ideal romantic comedy, funny, easy but also charming and cute. for another reviews: http://imdb.com/user/ur44998795/comments"

","Summary This movie is about two people Jamie and Dylan. They both are dating someone but got dumped. Jamie meets Dylan for her job. They like each other as friends. When they were watching a romantic movie they started talking about how they missed having sex, and so they decided to have sex with each other without any emotions or feeling. Dylan had to go back to LA because something was wrong with his father. Jamie was supposed to go somewhere with her mother but instead she went with Dylan to LA. Dylan his family thought they were a couple at first. When Dylan tried to have sex with her again that night Jamie didn't want to because she knew she started to have feelings for him. After that Dylan talked with his sister about Jamie because she knew something was wrong. Jamie heard the conversation and decided to go back home in New York. Dylan had a talk with his father and he told him he should go back to Jamie and make it up and so they ended up as a couple.<br/><br/>My opinion about the movie I love that movie. It's perfect.

"itamarscomix","8","0","2","18 July 2013"," A formula that works
","Friends With Benefits is a genre film and it isn't ashamed of it. It uses every cliché in the book and it uses them to full effect, better than any rom-com I've seen in ages. In an age where the classic rom-com is all but dead, when hipsterish films like (500) Days of Summer subvert every rule of the genre to hell and back for the sake of being edgy and subversive, Friends With Benefits is just self-aware and subversive enough to feel like it was made in 2011 and not twenty years earlier, but even if they make a snarky remark while doing it about the lack of realism in this sort of film, they still do everything you know - and hope - they will. The amazing thing is, it works. This comedy inspires true catharsis in the viewer and reminds us all why these clichés and rules were created in the first place - long before the genre turned into the bad, sticky joke that it is.<br/><br/>A lot of the credit should go to the cast, of course; because a film like this could never work if you're not rooting for the two leads to end up together. Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake, it should be noted, are not in any way great actors. When each one is alone on the screen, they fail to impress, and when they interact with any member of the excellent supporting cast - Richard Jenkins, Woody Harrelson, Patricia Clarkson and even Emma Stone - Kunis and Timberlake are always the less interesting and less magnetic half of the scene. And yet - when they're together, they have an incredible and natural chemistry, one that only the great couples of the silver screen could ever achieve, and they make even the sex scenes, that could have been awkward with other actors, feel natural and pleasant. They makes for a real and likable couple that you want to root for, even relate to, so much so that you can set aside your cynicism and forget that the scenario would have been very different with two people who, well, don't look like Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake.<br/><br/>Most of all, though, it's the screenplay that makes Friends With Benefits work against all odds. It shows real wit and understanding of the characters' age-group, and doesn't try too hard to be hip and modern that it alienates the viewers and the actors. It's radiant with love for New York City, turning it into as major a player in the story as the lead characters, giving the story a strong sense of location and reality. Most impressive of all is the dialog during the sex scenes, which is more candid, realistic and hilarious than you would ever expect from a rom-com. Where other films would stop short when these scenes and fade to black and blast up the music, Friends With Benefits doesn't really show what people having sex look like - it's still a mainstream American comedy, after all - but it does show us how they act, and it's extremely accurate, avoiding any manner of idealization or romanticization and as a result is very relatable and as a result, very funny.<br/><br/>I'm a heterosexual male. I don't, by definition, like romantic comedies. But I liked this one. I understood where the story was going about ten minutes in, I knew exactly what the characters were going to do, but I'll be damned if I didn't really want them to do it. And I enjoyed it all the while. Friends With Benefits won't change the world, it's highly likely that I won't remember it two years from now. But if, ten years from now, it'll pop up on TV, it'll jog a pleasant memory, and I'll watch it all over again. And it'll be two hours I'm sure to enjoy."

","I had seen rom-coms No Strings Attached and Love & Other Drugs which were both released within a couple of months of each other, and when I heard about this one it sounded exactly the same kind of format, I was expecting this to be the same standard of entertainment as well. Basically executive recruiter Jamie Rellis (Mila Kunis) is given the job of signing internet based art director Dylan Harper (Justin Timberlake) in Los Angeles for her client at GQ magazine in New York, he is hesitant for a while but is persuaded to change his mind after being given a tour of the city. After this fun night out he is given the contract to sign, and after this the two of them spend some time together and become friends, and one night watching a romantic movie together at home and get into a conversation about relationships and sex. After this chat they decide that they would like to have sex together without any emotion or commitment, and this becomes a frequent activity for them as they meet many times to do this, they see it as a good fun activity and almost fulfilling a basic need, but wanting to see other people though they decide to drop this and just stick to being friends. Soon after Dylan meets and starts dating Parker (Bryan Greenberg), and they too have sex, but he gets angry when she leaves him and they break up, Dylan suggests meeting up with Jamie on the July 4th weekend while he visits his older sister Annie (Jenna Elfman) and father Mr. Harper (Richard Jenkins), and they end up sharing a much more passionate night of intimacy unlike previously. She however overhears him and his sister talking about her where he says he does not have any true feelings for her, so upset she flies back to New York, and few days he returns there as well to try and reconcile their friendship and see why she has been ignoring him, when she does find her she confesses hearing what he said and does not want to be friends. Then Jamie finds out Dylan may be leaving GQ for another job, and talking about this leads to another argument between them, and apart they try to work out their feelings for each other, Jamie spends time with her mother Lorna (Patricia Clarkson), while Dylan's father is suffering the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, and he has to look after him with his confusion increasing. He talks to his gay friend and co-worker Tommy Bollinger (Woody Harrelson) about what he feels for her and decides he should go after her, he calls her mother to set her up to go to Grand Central Station tricked into thinking she is picking her up, but actually he is forming a flash mob. When Jamie arrives she is surprised by the flash mob suddenly dancing all over the station and Dylan tells her how he really feels, he share a passionate kiss and he says they should go on a real date for the first time, and they say they can leave the sex until later, but obviously this may be misconstrued. Also starring Emma Stone as Kayla, Andy Samberg as Quincy, Masi Oka as Darin Arturo Morena, Shaun White, Lili Mirojnick as Laura and Jason Segel as Brice (in the romantic movie on the TV). Timberlake proves he is still a likable actor following his role in The Social Network, and Kunis is a good choice as the spicy and beautiful friend turned lover, together they make a reasonable couple, as I expected it was pretty much exactly the same storyline as the films I mentioned, it has some funny moments though and it is sweet enough, a predictable but alright romantic comedy. Worth watching!"

","A film which should suit any age. Romance and comedy which is the perfect combination. Most people in live have attempted to have a friend with benefit, and this film tells you why its difficult to keep it. With the sexy actor Justin Timberlake and beautiful Mila Kunis, you watch two people who start of having a bit of fun, end up falling for each other. It's not all about the sex, a part of Dylan's (Timberlake) live has a secret which can relate to those who are also struggling with someone Alzheimer's. I loved the film and it suits anyone weather or not you haven't had a friend with benefit as it just makes you laugh throughout. All my friends have loved this film as it relates to everyone so you should watch it too, I highly recommend it."

","Well, it's obviously not a remake of When Harry Met Sally, but it's impossible not to make the comparison. There was even a straight homage/reference to Nora Ephron in one scene.<br/><br/>I haven't liked many new movies coming out of Hollywood in this millennium and have therefore not watched many lately, I'd rather been catching up on the classics I haven't seen. I watched this one without any expectations and it caught me by surprise, it had a heart which very few new movies have. The two characters were actually pretty likable and that's a key factor to this kind of movie. There's no point watching this kind of movie if you don't like the characters.<br/><br/>I read a few reviews stating Kunis and Timberlake didn't have chemistry, but I strongly disagree. I think this couple here is a real pleasure to watch. I've previously seen Timberlake only in The Open Road - one of the only movies I have actually stopped watching in the middle - the acting was just horrible. Here the story is totally different, Timberlake makes a great performance. Kunis has made a great career, something one might not have expected after the 70s Show.<br/><br/>The writing is nice for the most part, the dialog works. What I had a small problem with were a few dialogs that went ""under the belt"" so to say. It's a pity, since this is somewhat classy movie, even the sex scenes were done in a kind of tasty fashion. We don't need to know where someone's finger went or why it's difficult to pee at a certain occasion.<br/><br/>The dialog and pace is at times a tad too fast, resulting in bad editing. In a few occasions there is a clear jump cut, where a characters position changes noticeably between two consecutive images.<br/><br/>In any case, this was a bit of comeback for Hollywood in my eyes. It seems they can still create likable characters after all. Being the age where I remember When Harry Met Sally as a new movie, it's a great achievement that I could actually enjoy the ""same movie"" made for a new generation."

""Freinds with benefits"" is no exception.<br/><br/>What makes it work here is the lead pair Justin Timberlake & Mila Kunis and their electrifying chemistry which is a lifeline for a romantic comedy. The two are there in almost all the frames & you won't get tired of them. Mila Kunis' character is ""Genelia""esque ie, bubbly , over talkative , vulnerable yet tries her level best to externalize courage & gumption . Justin Timberlake's is that of the routine romcom hero who has his own share of secrets & vulnerabilities.<br/><br/>The writers Keith Merryman, David A. Newman, Will Gluck, & Harley Peyton have tried their level best to keep the story as fresh as possible & have succeeded to some extent . There are couple of very good moments like the flash mob scenes both at the beginning & right at the end , the one on the Hollywood hills to name a few .It is very difficult to shy away from the routine & those romcom clichés' do get in now & then. Will Gluck has directed the movie competently without leaving any space for boredom. The pace is maintained right through .<br/><br/>The movie has a striking similarity to ""No strings attached"" especially the central theme is the same but enjoyable all the same. But the characters are more adorable & the movie has more lively moments than that of the former .<br/><br/>On the whole , ""Friends with Benefits"" is a nice time pass. Go for it.<br/><br/>Bottomline : Breezy...!"

","FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS is a bit of a twist on the usual run of romantic comedies; hook-ups are for sexual gratification only with no emotional strings attached -unless.... And that is where this film starts out, with a lot of promise. The story is by Harley Peyton with assistance from Keith Merryman and David A. Newman who with director Will Gluck adapted the story for the screenplay. Sound like a lot of cooks to spoil the broth? Well, in part it probably is as there are many little subplots here that bump into each other.<br/><br/>Jamie Rellis (Mila Kunis) is a New York head-hunter trying to sign Los Angeles-based Dylan Harper (Justin Timberlake) for her client. When he takes the job and makes the move, they quickly become friends. Their friendship turns into a friendship with benefits, but with Jamie's emotionally damaged past and Dylan's history of being emotionally unavailable, they have to try to not fall for each other the way Hollywood romantic comedies dictate. Add to this fairly substantial idea the gay character Tommy Bollinger (Woody Harelson in a fine little cameo) and Patricia Clarkson as Jamie's galavanting mother and the mix becomes funny. Despite a rather intrusive copout ending there is PLENTY of eye candy from Timberlake and Kunis and lots of bed romping. It's goofy but entertaining and it does show that Justin Timberlake is becoming a fine leading man on screen. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","Similar to the recent ""No Strings Attached"", this rom-com asks the question, can you have sex without love or a relationship? Of course if you are Milas Kunis or Justin Timberlake your chances will be somewhat higher than the average Joe but as an average Joe, you probably know the answer to that question already.<br/><br/>Maybe but it would certainly be difficult, human nature being what it is.<br/><br/>Dylan Harper (Justin Timberlake) is the archetypal young ""designer type"", doing lots of flash stuff on a ""Minority Report style"" board and being paid lots of money to do art/design for a blog site.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Jamie Rellis (Mila Kunis) is a headhunter in New York attempting to fill a senior art/design position for GQ in New York. Following a bad start at the airport the two meet and Jamie attempts to ""sell"" New York to Dylan by giving him the grand but secret tour, after a quick flash mob and obligatory out of bounds rooftop view of the city, Dylan is sold.<br/><br/>The pair then decide that not only have they become firm friends but the idea of becoming ""bed buddies"" is rather appealing, both being healthy specimens with compatible body parts, no strings attached, no nasty breakups and they will remain friends forever, all sorted.<br/><br/>We are then treated to the usual movie montage of sex scenes that are reasonably explicit in a main stream movie and on occasion stray into, ""did we really need to know that much detail"", territory.<br/><br/>Timberlake and Kunis have good chemistry together on screen, making a believable young couple having a great time, with good jobs, lives and apartments.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson pops up as a flamboyantly gay Art Director, befriending Dylan and adding a few good one liners, although the character is largely irrelevant to the story, aside of providing an audience view of Dylan's thinking but it is always good to see Harrelson back on screen.<br/><br/>Kunis is sexy and natural, Timberlake plays an extension of himself and does nothing to dispel concerns over his range, following his excellent turn in ""The Social Network"".<br/><br/>So far, just your usual sex comedy, the film then deviates from the norm by looking for some depth as Dylan introduces Jamie to his family. This takes on a more serious tone which does rescue the movie from some of the usual rom-com clichés. Not that it avoids them all, queue Hollywood sign rescue but there is an attempt to move away from the shallow end.<br/><br/>Jenna Elfman, Patricia Clarkson & Richard Jenkins all contribute to this widening of the story and add some necessary acting weight, providing perhaps the best segment of the film. Yet more demonstration, if it were needed, that generally good actors help to make better films.<br/><br/>As they say, ""who would have thought...."" <br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Fun in parts with definite sparks between the leads, an adequate rom-com for the under 30's but older audiences may wish for a more chaste approach.<br/><br/>Marginally better than ""No Strings attached"" but overall adds little to the genre but at least aims a little higher, albeit falling short into acceptable date movie territory."

Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are the leads, and Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson and Pat Clarkson are on hand for support. Veteran character actor Richard Jenkins plays Timerlake's dad who is slowly slipping into dementia. The sex scenes are tame for an R-rated flick, and played strictly for laughs. They are in no way erotic, for you worried parents out there. Also, for most of the movie, Kunis doesn't look all that appealing.

","'FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Another movie about friends trying to stay friends while involving sex in their relationship and hoping not to complicate things. This one features yet another talented and high caliber actress (Mila Kunis) coming off a critically praised film ('BLACK SWAN'), in a critically acclaimed performance, and is paired in a lowbrow 'f--- buddy' film with a much less talented actor (Justin Timberlake). This one is slightly better than Kunis's 'BLACK SWAN' costar's ('NO STRINGS ATTACHED'), despite lacking the presence of the great Natalie Portman. Kunis is great in the film and does have a certain amount of chemistry with the lightweight Timberlake but the movie as a whole is still very predictable and extremely light on laughs.<br/><br/>Kunis and Timberlake play Jamie and Dylan, Jamie is an Executive Recruiter for a New York based job agency and Dylan is an art director for a company in Los Angeles. Both have had their fair share of failed relationships and are ready to give up on love all together. When Jamie tries to recruit Dylan for a GQ art directing job in New York City the two immediately hit it off. Dylan takes the job and the two quickly become best friends. One day while watching a romantic comedy together (starring Jason Segel and Rashida Jones) the two come up with the idea of adding sex to their relationship without any of it's romantic entanglements. This of course leads to many complications especially when they begin falling for each other.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Will Gluck (who also directed the critically acclaimed hit 'EASY A' in 2010, and it's star Emma Stone has a cameo in this film) and it was written by Gluck, Keith Merryman, David A. Newman and Harley Peyton. It's adequately directed and the relationship aspect of the film is believable. The problem with the film is it's just not funny. Kunis has by far the most laughs and brings a lot of energy to her performance but Timberlake almost sucks all the energy out of the film at the same time. His line delivery is pretty bad and he just doesn't make a good leading man. He's been fine is supporting comedic performances but when he has to play it straight he just doesn't have the skills to hold his own with someone like Kunis.

Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis share a delightful chemistry, and they fill their characters with such charm and charisma. They round up a terrific cast ensemble including Patricia Clarkson as Mila Kunis' crazy mother, Richard Jenkins as the Alzheimer stricken father to Justin Timberlake, Emma Stone, Andy Samberg, and Shaun White all in funny cameos, and Woody Harrelson in a scene-stealing performance as Timberlake's gay business partner. There are some laughs to be had, from beginning to end, and it's pretty cool to watch Timberlake and Kunis have a chemistry in the bedroom. Director Will Gluck has a perfect idea of organizing a sexy script with some heart, a terrific cast, and some truly funny moments.

"JohnRayPeterson","7","0","1","9 December 2011"," Unoriginal, predictable, yet fun; more than earlier films on the subject
","This is not the earlier 2011 'No Strings Attached'; it has the same general theme and unavoidable similar conclusion but that's where the two movies part. I don't summarize the plot; for that, see your usual sources like IMDb storyline. In my review of 'No Strings Attached' (which you can read by clicking the 'Jrlock' author link), I spoke of the demographics of the ratings and how it translated to chic flic by a slim margin. The same applies here. However, as of the moment I'm writing this review, the rating of 6.6 for 'Friends' vs the 6.2 for 'No Strings' says the audience preferred the newer film; I do. Instead of a Kevin Klein figure that added spunk to 'No Strings', this movie, 'Friends', has a more sympathetic dad in Richard Jenkins, plus 'Friends' has a support role by Woody Harrelson who plays Tommy, the irrepressible gay new buddy of Timberlake. He's good in that role; Harrelson's good in most all his roles. These two supporting actors, Jenkins and Harrelson, outweigh, in my opinion, Klein's contribution (even if I'm a bigger fan of Klein).<br/><br/>Mila Kunis, who plays Jamie, was, wellWoof! I much preferred her character both for her personality and 'coup d'oeuil' (I wanted to avoid using the expression eye candy again in this review). The part of Jamie was much better written than that of Emma in the earlier movie. Speaking of script, this movie's writing made for a faster pace, to match the hustle character of New York and yet it flowed very nicely. The dialogue blows away the one of 'No Strings', and upon reflection you will come to that conclusion; it is suited to the part of the title which contains the word FRIENDS. And that's what marks the difference between the two movies, the relationship. I wanted to avoid writing about Justin Timberlake because I never cared for any of his 14 other movie performances, least of all the one in 'Black Snake Moan' which was despite Timberlake, is a very good movie; however the writing in 'Friends' was so good that I found Timberlake, in the role of Dylan (somehow it's a name that fits Justin), quite bearable. Most might find that comment petty; I acknowledge that for all who have read some of my reviews and for everyone else, I don't care. Kunis and Timberlake were more convincing than Kutcher and Portman.<br/><br/>Finally, to those who write reviews complaining about romantic comedies, like this one, saying it's predictable etc. etc.; get over yourself, that's how Hollywood romantic comedies are. They also inevitably end in a fairytale like 'feel good' conclusion. It's a formula, a recipe, a mold. Your favorite actors, directors and the good writers are what make you pick these movies, not the bloody story; it's also why you like one more than an other. Be adventurous and watch European movies and then you can write opinions of some value, otherwise stop whining damn it."
"lewiskendell","7","0","1","8 December 2011"," More friends with more benefits.
","Friends with Benefits is much funnier and raunchier than your average romantic comedy. What really makes it work is the on-screen chemistry between Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake, who have both never been more charismatic or appealing than they are here. The two keep things interesting (and sexy) even when the story takes a turn for familiar territory. <br/><br/>Which it inevitably does. Two attractive friends decide to have a strictly physical arrangement in order to avoid the typical complications of a relationship, but things inexorably get messy when feelings start to encroach, despite their best attempts to keep things casual. We're hardly in spoiler territory, here, and while the story isn't revolutionary, there are enough wrinkles in it to keep it from feeling stale. And as I said before, Kunis and Timberlake are so likable that just having them on the screen is entertaining. The first half of the movie is quite amusing, too, though that gets toned down some as things get more serious. <br/><br/>In the battle of ""friends having sex movies"" between this, Love and Other Drugs (admittedly, that movie ultimately goes for a very different vibe) and No Strings Attached, Friends with Benefits is definitely the winner in my opinion.

Their mutual relationship gets underway when Dylan who is in dilemma whether to accept the offer from ""CQ"" or not. So to sell off that offer she decides to ""Sell New York"" location rather than the Job itself. Their friendship develops eventually and they come out with a plan to have casual intercourse considering it a game just like tennis. The relationship grew day by day before they actually fell in love without each being aware of it. During the run of play, Dylan visits his hometown in LA to his family and decides to take Jamie along with himself. As they developed a friendship with sexual benefits, they had one course at their home but to the surprise of Dylan, his sister watches him leave Jamie's room and they think that they both are in a relationship. But when Dylan was saying some ill-words against Jamie to his sister to shrug her off, unfortunately she listens to it and decides to leave back to New York early next morning. Now when he comes back to New York he finds Jamie behaving strangely and they both decide to put an end to their friendship. But the moment of enlightenment comes to Dylan when his father visits him in New York and he pour his hearts out when he admits of having an incomplete loving relationship which he was unable to make reach its penultimate goal and how that has hampered his life ever since and suddenly he realises what Jamie meant to him in his life. So he make amends and movie ends on a high note wherein both admits their eternal love for each other and lives happily ever after. The review would be incomplete without placing a special emphasis to the character of Tommy (Woody Harrelson) who plays a small but beautiful role of a content writer at CQ. His philosophy and approach makes the movie hilarious as well as interesting. His dialogue wherein he tells Dylan about his philosophy is the pick of his character and helps him to realize his friendship with Jamie. I would give a decent 7/10 for this Rom-Com and hopes people would appreciate a simple movie as it is rather than getting dissection of each of its aspects."

Despite being picture perfect, Mila Kunis does not add much to her role apart from being beautiful for beautiful sake. At the end of the day, Friends with Benefits does not work because it doesn't walk the talk.

I'm a big fan of Kutcher, so that kind of put me in a favour-situation, but nevertheless I will be objective.<br/><br/>FWB starts in the funny way, meeting Dylan who tries getting settled in NY. OK, the first 30 minutes have its moments and is kind of funny. And I will not criticize the way they introduce the friend-sex-thing, it is an (if it is possible to believe) convincing dialog sequence (actually all the dialog is not that bad). The problem is that the story and jokes aren't funny. Except for the first part, I think the homosexual guy is the best thing and it ends up with that I only wait for him to say something funny. This is were I think Portman and especially Kutcher succeeded BIGtime.<br/><br/>Sorry Kunis, still think you are really good, but you should have stayed at That's 70s Show.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Due to the overwhelming number of ""blah"" reviews, purely to balance the universe I felt compelled to review this.<br/><br/>I just watched this movie twice in a row. I watched it early today and watched it again when my wife came home. Nearly as funny the second time. Laughed out loud a bunch of times. <br/><br/>The dialogue is very fast and full of tiny jokes that a lot of people would easily miss, and further a handful of jokes are repeated throughout the movie. ""Hollywood sign...LA's only real landmark."" Minutes later,news caster covering the event makes the same observation. (However, most people will laugh at the joke just before this one and miss the newscaster repeating it) Dumb people are too slow to follow the dialogue, so they'll get mad and call it boring.<br/><br/>I gave this a bunch of stars not because it's a perfect movie in every way. It's not incredibly deep. It doesn't deal with world war II victims or some serious mind bending bull crap, but it ridiculously excels at what it does.<br/><br/>Just because something has clichés isn't bad. There is nothing new under the sun folks. All you negatives out there that are so hard to please and so overly stimulated you're bored to death - just slit your wrists already.<br/><br/>ps. A review is not a synopsis, you would-be reviewers!"

","¨I have the perfect body for Photoshop. This (face) gets more angular, these (legs) get longer, and this (nose) get way more Christian.¨ I don't think anyone would have a problem in real life believing that Mila Kunis could be a model, but this is just a movie so we go with the flow when she tries to convince someone she works as a model in order to find Justin Timberlake's character in a photo shoot. Friends with Benefits is director Will Gluck's follow up to his very successful 2010 comedy: Easy A, and although it isn't as great as a film as that one was, the movie still manages to entertain thanks to a decent script and a great chemistry between Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. This movie actually had all the ingredients to fail: First of all there was a very similar movie that came out in the same month staring Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis's Black Swan partner, Natalie Portman. Second the film follows the same formula most romantic comedies do, and we can anticipate the ending miles away. So, why did I enjoy the film as much as I did? I admit the chemistry between Timberlake and Kunis was great, but that isn't enough for me to make a film of this caliber enjoyable. I also have to admit that I love Mila Kunis and think she is extremely gorgeous on film, but that neither is enough for me to enjoy this movie. I actually enjoyed the plot quite a bit and found most of the things happening believable. I know love doesn't work like this all the time, but there can be a couple of occasions in which true love can be magical and predictable. Some girls have found their Prince Charming, and that is the story some filmmakers have decided to tell despite all the clichés and formulas.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake plays an upcoming successful blogger from Los Angeles named Dylan who happens to have some good job offers coming his way from New York. Jamie (Mila Kunis) is a work agent who makes Dylan the offer to come to New York to work as the editor for GQ Magazine. Dylan just ended up being dumped by his girlfriend for being emotionally unavailable and decides to give New York a shot. Jamie was also recently dumped by her boyfriend, so both Dylan and Jamie realize it is better to focus on work and not enter relationships at this stage of their lives. Jamie convinces Dylan to accept the job by selling him the idea that New York is a great place to live and he agrees. Once in New York, both of them begin to form a strong bond together and become real good friends. They both agree that they don't want to be in relationships at the moment, but they miss sex. All of a sudden they both come up with the idea that they should sleep together without dealing with the whole relationship issue. They decide they can have sex just like two friends would play a game of tennis together, without all the romantic emotional stuff involved. Of course the plot gets more complicated than this and emotions begin to affect their relationship. Patricia Clarkson plays Lorna, Jamie's hippie loving mother, while Jenna Elfman plays Annie, Dylan's older and caring sister. Richard Jenkins is Dylan's father, while Woody Harrelson also has a supporting role as Tommy, the sports editor for GQ magazine.<br/><br/>The entire cast is really fantastic in this film. The strong chemistry between the two lead roles (Timberlake and Kunis) is supported by a magnificent cast. Richard Jenkins is always great, and in this movie he plays the role of a father suffering from Alzheimer to perfection. Jenna Elfman is also great in her role as the sweet and caring sister, but the two supporting characters who get the most laughs are Patricia Clarkson and Woody Harrelson. Patricia is great as the free loving hippie mother, and Harrelson shines as the gay sports editor. The plot also works really well despite following all the Hollywood clichés that the film sort of tries to make fun of when they have Jamie and Dylan watch romantic comedies together and rip them off for being so predictable. The screenwriters were a little hypocritical because they followed most of the same formulas those movies did, but I still had a good time with it and laughed at several scenes. I also liked that there was more to Timberlake's character than what we were first introduced to. We got to see some of the depth that he had in the film and he did a great job with his role. I thought I was going to hate this film, but I was surprised at how much I ended up liking it. The first half hour was a little strong for me, but after that the film picked up and ended up having a good message after all.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"clivey6","6","0","1","26 September 2011"," Slender premise
","The main angle here, as with No Strings Attached, is that of the booty call - sex available on request from a 'friend' who you fancy but don't wish to date. Problem is, it's a slender premise for a comedy in this case, because the two leads hang out together, chat, as well as have sex. So really, from the viewers' perspective, it's just your average romantic comedy. There's never any clash of tension, such as one of the leads bringing back a new beau and receiving an inappropriate or untimely 'booty call', or either of them facing disapproval from a friend or relative over their cynical arrangement. In many ways, this is like When Harry Met Sally, only condensed into two months rather than 20 years or so, and the sex out the way from the start. Even then not as funny, because here the two leads pretty much agree on stuff from the get go.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this does take off and becomes more likable as it goes on, but the two leads aren't too great to watch with their kit off and none of it seems too sexy or even kookily sexy to me. It has to be padded out with other themed stuff - the LA/New York divide and their respective parents. It becomes quite watchable and passes the time, but it's never that sexy or that romantic."

","It was obvious from the trailer that this was going to be a fun movie to watch! JT has a lot of humour in his acting and Mila Kunis is good in any movie, I think...<br/><br/>Friend with Benefits is as predictable as any romantic-comedy though. They meet, they get on, they fall out, they declare their love for each other and live happily ever after. At least I knew what I was in for! I enjoyed watching how the fun on-screen relationship between JT and Mila progressed, from meeting in the airport to being 'FwB' and on from there. There were other amusing roles around them too, with Dylan's sister and her son. Also, Dylan's father who has Alzheimers likes to walk around with no pants on. Then there's Jamie's mother who is a bit wild and comes and goes throughout the movie.<br/><br/>My favourite part was probably when Dylan finally tells Jamie how he really feels in a very extravagant way. It was a bit cliché but makes you smile. And a good song choice too! Overall, I think it is worth a watch if you're in the mood for a funny, sexy comedic romance. And if you don't want to pay to watch then it's a must when it shows on TV! 7/10 for me - could've been better but for the predictable story."

","this is not a path-breaking movie. it's just a simple love story. it has some funny lines, a few interesting characters, and some beautiful visuals. mila kunis is ""pretty,amazing"". JT seems to be getting into his groove. of late, his performances have been really impressive. the best thing about this film is the pace at which it moves, slowly in parts, and at breakneck speed in others. it slows down in precisely those portions where you want to look at things a little more deeply, and otherwise it just zooms away when the mood lightens up. you end up with a smile on your face, in the end, and you feel the time was well spent. with all the concept-heavy movies that seem to come out of Hollywood these days, it's nice, for a change, to watch a light-hearted, romantic comedy. good thing some film-makers out there realise that a part of the audience still wants to watch some conventional stuff. highly recommended!"

","Executive Recruitment Consultant Jamie (Mila Kunis) lures designer Dylan (Justin Timberlake) to New York, and they become easy friends. Both have just been dumped and so they decide that it would be a good idea, given that they both miss sex, if they start having sex on a ""no strings"" basis. Despite a promising start, it all goes pear-shaped.<br/><br/>Boy meets girl, audience can see they are a perfect match, all goes well, something gums up the works, last act solves the problem and resolves the relationship. The rules of the romcom are so fundamental that to breach them would probably result in the earth tipping off its axis or something equally apocalyptic. Fortunately, Friends With Benefits takes no such risks, treading very nearly the exact same course as No Strings Attached from about 6 months ago (Hollywood turning out 2 films about the same thing at nearly the same time - fancy that. Who'd have thought?).<br/><br/>So we have an unoriginal romcom. What else do we have? We have a surprisingly small amount of bad language, most of which comes from Emma Stone's short and very funny cameo within the first 5 minutes). We have quite a lot of sexual talk, sexual activity, and nudity although, since this is Hollywood, the talk can be as frank as you like (and it is fairly frank), but the sexual activity and nudity are absolutely non-explicit - lots of underwear, bare bums but no bits, and lots of Hollywood sheets covering up anything interesting.<br/><br/>Importantly, though, we have engaging people who we care about (with very good performances from both Timberlake, in his first primary role and Kunis, doing as good a cute-and-sexy as I've ever seen), we have an entertaining and intelligent script (hooray!), we have secondary characters and situations who add to the main story rather than detract, and we have heart.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this."

","This movie really takes on the question of can their really be friends with benefits. Well i have always wondered this and I'm sure some of you have to. Im not going to ruin the movie for anyone so i will just keep this very simple. This movie does a pretty good job conveying this question. I have to give a Shout out to Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis they really seemed to fit the characters extremely well. Me being a huge Mila Kunis fan thought that this really fit with the personas she has had from previous movies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Justin i thought also did a really good job by seeing the way he acts from his music videos and just the way he looks really seems to work well with this character. I do not recommend seeing this movie with younger kids as pretty much there are some scenes that they shouldn't see, granted its the parents choice on letting them see it or not. I feel that this movie is one of the movies that really should be taken into notice romantically. I thought though out this movie that this is worthy to be competing with movies like Hitch. Thats would probably be the closest thing i could compare this movie to. That being said i feel that this movie has a different angle on Love and this new angle that they work really seems to work well.<br/><br/>Overall: Great Movie, Great Acting, and MOST of all GREAT THEME."
"lyncorr","7","0","2","2 September 2011"," Friends with Benefits - a romance comedy with a twist...
","Friends with Benefits is a movie that I can watch over and over again, though the first time is always best. Yes it's a rom-com but it's not your usual predictable ""happily ever after."" The two characters: Jamie and Dylan (played by Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake) each get dumped by their partners at the beginning of the movie for being ""emotionally damaged"" (Jamie) and ""emotionally unavailable"" (Dylan). Kunis's character plays a headhunter working on behalf of GQ magazine to attract Dylan who is a web designer that runs a successful blog back in LA. He thinks his life is pretty perfect until he meets Jamie and decides to take the job after she gives him a sneak peak of life in NYC. The two demonstrate that people often elude true love for fear of getting their emotions trampled upon. It just goes to show that beauty, success, brains and money do not protect you from getting hurt and it happens to the best of us.<br/><br/>They pledge to both ""lock off"" their feelings (just like George Clooney) and have a casual ""friends with benefits"" relationship until they end up falling for each other. There's a realistic plot and the tension that occurs near the end of the movie, leads to a climax that couldn't be sweeter and can be described as a modern day fairytale. One of my long time favourite actors Woody Harrelson played a super funny character that offered some pearls of wisdom to Dylan. It also has a certain seriousness to it as it gives a glimpse of what living with Alzheimer's disease is like and also how broken (single parent) homes can affect a person's future relationships. Timberlake and Kunis had great on screen chemistry that made for a realistic film which however should be taken with a grain of salt. With a little help from his Dad and the ""flash mob"" Dylan is able to open his heart and allow love in and Jamie is able to ""live out"" her favourite movie. The film ends with a beginning – Jamie and Dylan's first date as a real couple. The only thing missing was the horse and carriage, which was in fact present, but the writers allowed a funny twist that made it even more real.<br/><br/>The movie can be best summarized by my favourite line by Woody Harrelson's character, Tommy: ""It's not who you want to spend Friday night withit's who you want to spend all day Saturday with."" <br/><br/>I give this movie 7 stars!!!"

","Set in the Big Apple, 'Friends With Benefits' (2011), follows LA-based art director Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and New Yorker corporate head-hunter Jamie (Mila Kunis), who both have been dumped by their respective partners after being labelled emotionally damaged and unavailable. After Jamie is assigned to lure Dylan to the GQ offices in New York, they quickly form a close friendship. As the title suggests, they eventually attempt to experiment with their friendship by adding sex into the equation, all the while convinced they can remain 'just-friends'.<br/><br/>Directed by Will Gluck, who directed and produced the brilliant 'Easy A' (2010), 'Friends With Benefits' is pretty much your run-of-the-mill rom-com. The script at the beginning offers the possibility of a unique plot line, as the characters declare Hollywood to be full of unrealistic love, however the film ends with a highly predictable finish that goes against the ideas brought forth in the first half an hour. <br/><br/>The two leads are solid, however, and Justin Timberlake shines somewhat in the last 30 minutes, giving his character more depth than that is usually found in romantic comedies. However it is the supporting cast that really add to the film, Patricia Clarkson as Jamie's mother is excellent, and Jenna Elfman is genuinely believable as Dylan's sister, struggling with their father's Alzheimer's. Woody Harrelson is somewhat wasted, however, as Dylan's gay friend, with the writers resorting to tiresome stereotypes for the duration of his time on screen. <br/><br/>Overall, while the cast is solid and there are genuine laughs to be had, the first 30 minutes promises something other than the ending that we are left with, and will inevitably go into the enormous pile of predictable rom-coms."

","Touching, Funny and warm.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake stars as Dylan; the arts director for GQ magazine in NYC alongside Mila Kunis who plays Jamie a successful headhunter. Dylan meets Jamie when he flies over from LA for his job interview with GQ magazine and is her client. Jamie becomes a friend to Dylan in NYC since he has no friends in this town as yet apart from Tommy who is his gay colleague who Dylan keeps a distance with for obvious reasons. Dylan and Jamie who are both on the rebound after failed relationships are currently off the market and living it up single like George Clooney (Or so they think). FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS finally is a rom-com for both male and the female audience. Fast flowing and hilarious it's a very well- orchestrated directorial by Will Gluck.<br/><br/>The success behind FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS is a great combination of acting talent, script and the directorial. Dylan and Tommy (Woddy Harreison) keep the whole life in the movie all cheerful at all times. I have watched Justin Timberlake in many movies before however this is by far one his best performances. The scene on the Hollywood sign is hilarious and very brilliantly done by both Justin and Mila. (You have got to watch this). Since the performance in BLACK SWAN to see Mila Kunis on screen is quite welcome. The 28 year old Ukrainian beauty is as stunning as always and very convincing. During the latter moments when her character moves into realization she brings out Jamie convincingly and connects with the viewers. Even so drawing a few tears if you're very sensitive. Especially to a female audience! Jenna Elfman who is hilarious in the sitcom ACCIDENTLLY ON PURPOSE plays a mellow Annie, who is Dylan's sister. Richard Jenkins as always has clarity. If you have seen him in VISITOR you will know exactly what I am refereeing to. However this time round he is a mix between being serious and funny and he does not seem to enjoy wearing his pants much!<br/><br/>A very modern soundtrack compliments this worth watching movie. Most directors fail to infiltrate mass numbers of viewers today since they mess up on the soundtracks. Musical scores and soundtracks are an extension to the greatness and the success of a movie. As much as the visual senses are tingled by lively colors and amazing scenic beauties of the skyline in NY and LA, the auditory senses need some sensation too. Will Gluck's choices in the auditory aspects are smart selections. The soundtrack can be called very commercial and less original, however, the more the people know it the more they will enjoy it. Would I be right in saying that?<br/><br/>A movie not be missed, it's not too heavy to grasp, a very basic story of emotion. It may be called a low calorie movie! Well balanced in its humor and lighter moments. Although it is not for the whole family (due to nudity) it's a movie worth spending your money and time on.<br/><br/>Title: Friends with Benefits Directed by: Will Gluck Starring: Justin Timberlake, Mila Kunis, Jenna Elfman, Richard Jenkins, Bryan Greenberg & Woody Harreison Rated: Rating: 07/10 Minutes!!!"

"JdotCo","Null","0","2","11 August 2011"," ""Friends With Benefits"" a worthy rom-com
","(There's a couple of mild spoilers in this review, but nothing too bad).<br/><br/>I have a theory on this one. During their time on the set of ""Black Swan"", Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman talked to each other about making identical movies. They probably even had a little contest between each other on which one would have the better movie. <br/><br/>Portman thought she and Ashton Kutcher would be perfect together and it would be a can't-miss flick. Thus, ""No Strings Attached"" was made. Not a great movie, though better than most gave it credit for. Portman was still good. She did as good a job with that one as anyone else could've done. <br/><br/>Kunis liked her chances with Justin Timberlake. And six months later, we got ""Friends with Benefits."" <br/><br/>Kunis definitely won the bet. <br/><br/>""Friends with Benefits"" outdid its predecessor in several ways and turned out to be a quite the charmer. The movie had zippier dialogue and funnier jokes (though nothing was as funny as the period mix in ""No Strings Attached""). Kunis and Timberlake demanded screen time together with a charming chemistry that produced moments of joy, sorrow, attraction, reservation, hurt and betrayal.<br/><br/>It might be shocking to say, but Timberlake actually played the part. Seldom did I feel like it was just Timberlake reciting lines and singing (yes, he sings a little bit). He actually came across as a guy who was really trying to figure things out and learning how to handle adversity when it came his way. <br/><br/>The premise of the movie was simple. Jamie (Kunis) is a recruiting shark who convinces Dylan (Timberlake) to move to New York and take a big job at GQ magazine. As Jamie woos Dylan, they start to open up to each other and realize they want the same thing at this particular point in their lives: sex without the emotional attachment that comes from relationships. <br/><br/>Sound simple enough? Of course not. Sure, they both enjoy the physicality of this endeavor, but eventually, things get too close for comfort. As they threaten to cross the threshold from sex partners to being a couple, true feelings throw a curve ball into the mix, and now they're left sorting out the mess. <br/><br/>What makes ""Friends with Benefits"" work is how the characters change their approach through the course of the story. Kunis gets hurt, and it shows. Timberlake gets bitter for a little bit, and it shows. <br/><br/>It also helped that when trouble arose, there actually were sorrowful, emotional moments off of which they played. The bad stuff that happened in ""No Strings Attached"" just felt like the next step in the movie. In ""Friends with Benefits"", Dylan's father, Mr. Harper (Richard Jenkins), had physical issues that truly left a mark on Dylan. Though a bit predictable, his father's predicament gave him a better perspective of his own situation, which, in turn, helps both him and Jamie. <br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast rounded the movie nicely. Woody Harrelson plays Tommy, a co-worker of Dylan's who is gay, and is convinced Dylan is gay, or least tries to convince Dylan of this. Jenna Elfman plays Dylan's sister, who thinks he and Jamie are perfect for each other and enjoys talking about her brother to Jamie (where has Elfman been, and why has she only been in two movies the last seven years? She deserves more work). <br/><br/>The story ends in a typical cliché rom-com way (actually, there's a scene at the end of the credits, which I'm proud to say that, out of the 75 or so people who came at the same showing, I was only one who got to watch it). But even that seemed fitting for the story. Whether it was the solid delivery of the lines or just quick style by which they were delivered, ""Friends with Benefits"" just clicked."

","As many, many have pointed out Friends With Benefits is practically a carbon copy of the earlier release No String Attached. The difference? Friends With Benefits did everything right!! It really is the stereotypical romantic comedy but holds no punches and even takes time to poke fun at itself and the entire genre but unapologetically serves up exactly what it makes fun of. Irony! The laughs are non stop, and the adult humor is without pause throughout the whole thing. They could have easily toned down the adult tone but given the film is about sex it makes more sense to have a good ol' fashion R Rated comedies which are already ruling this summer anyways. It is simply fun to watch and yes it does end up pulling out the predictability you can expect from any romantic comedy but wouldn't you be disappointed if it didn't? As mentioned they manage to poke fun of itself and its own genre and ends with a cute heartwarming ending that wraps everything up.<br/><br/>First of all let me just say that Justin Timberlake is going to be become a Hollywood A-Lister. His charisma on screen, his comedic talent, and his acting ability is outstanding! He makes the film worthwhile for anyone and handily carries the film. Mila Kunis gives one of her best performances since That 70's Show. Her character is stereotypical to a T. The hot young successful woman with a wild side that makes the male lead do things he would never have done before making him fall head over heels for her. But she is terrific and fun to watch and the chemistry between Kunis and Timberlake is near legendary. As far as I'm concerned it's Richard Gere/Julia Roberts worthy. They are great together. The supporting cast is nothing short of brilliant. Patricia Clarkson, Jenna Elfman, and the amazing Richard Jenkins are absolutely terrific in their respective roles. The only disappointing performance is that of Woody Harrelson whose 'gay' character is way overdone and becomes annoying rather than endearing when everyone else grows on you.<br/><br/>Director Will Gluck is fairly new to directing but he has hit two big home runs in my book. First was the sleeper hit Easy A which seems to have made Emma Stone (who makes a small cameo in this film) an A-Lister pardon the pun and now this film. Simply he knows how to entertain and I think he has a big eye for talent. I doubt that Gluck will ever take home an Academy Award but he will entertain without a doubt. I know how some reviewers will take this film...predictable, mushy, overly dramatic in spots but I am judging this by sheer and utter entertainment value and I was thrilled with how entertaining it was. It is truly the perfect date movie because girls will love it and guys can enjoy it just as much for the comedy and the performances. An A+ movie experience!! 8.5/10"

","I just saw a preview in London with the very nice Will Gluck coming on stage afterwards to talk about the film. <br/><br/>Romcoms really aren't my cup of tea, and I'm especially wary of the sub-genre that claim to subvert the genre's clichés. 500 Days of Summer really annoyed me in its grandiose claims to be a new kind of rom-com where the guy doesn't end up with the girl. It turned out to be just as predictable as the rest. And you know what? People want to see the guy get the girl...it's what they're paying their hard earned money for.<br/><br/>It's to Will Gluck and the other writers' credit that they get that. Instead of subverting the clichés and alienating their audience, they PLAY with them instead. The main characters sit in front of the TV watching a rom-com (itself a really funny film within a film) and skewer all of the plot points and character tics that you get in studio comedies. The fact that they go on to mouth the same clichés in their own lives is deliberate and well-managed. It's called having your cake and eating it and, by and large, they get away with it. <br/><br/>As with all rom-coms it's made or broken by the leads. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are good actors, sure, but crucially they're Likable. You want to see them happy at the end, and you don't really care so much about how they get there. <br/><br/>The first hour is really fun. Lots of jokes about LA vs NYC; the cringe-worthy way people break-up with people; your first day in a new job, that kind of thing. <br/><br/>The last half-hour falls a bit flat, and there are a couple of poorly judged moments where Justin starts stammering and acting like an 8 yr-old wuss. But I can't remember the last time a comedy of any description held its nerve and its tone for the full 90 minutes so I won't judge this one too harshly. <br/><br/>Basically, go see it. You'll be pleasantly surprised rather than disappointed. Justin Timberlake's acting is going from strength to strength and he and Mila make a fun couple. It's an interesting take on the 'this isn't really a rom-com, you know' sub-genre and the best one I've seen in a while."

","Dylan (Justin Timberlake) is a dot.com designer living in the City of Angels near his ailing father (Richard Jenkins) and his sister, Annie (Jenna Elfman) and her young son. However, he is so talented at his job that he is soon ""head-hunted"" by Jamie (Mila Kunis) to work for GQ magazine in New York. If Jamie can persuade Dylan to take the job, she will get a big bonus. For his part, Dylan has to be sold because he loves the west coast. But, Jamie does her recruiting well and convinces Dylan to make the change. Very soon, the two of them realize a growing attraction but since both have them have had past romantic difficulties, especially Jamie, they decide on the ground rules. There will be no commitments or expressions of love, in their future relationship, only a friendship with sexual benefits. Things get more complicated when Jamie's ditzy mother (Patricia Clarkson) comes back to stay with Jamie and Dylan's father's dementia gets worse. When Jamie goes along with Dylan on a holiday trip to Los Angeles, the future of their pact seems in danger of changing. Will they stay together or will they call it quits? This is an entertaining romcom with likable characters, nice scenery, great costumes, and good acting. Timberlake is especially surprising in his acting ability, my view, for music is surely his main pursuit. Kunis also does a good job while Clarkson, Jenkins, Elfman and all of the others are fine, too. Special praise should go to Woody Harrelson, who plays a gay colleague of Dylan's, as he does terrific work in a difficult role. So, that's that. However, this film is a far cry from the days of Pillow Talk and such. It has many explicit sexual scenes and travels a quite different path to a ""true love conquers all"" conclusion. In my opinion, this is so because Hollywood is changing the romcom rules to appease male viewers who are dragged to date night films they hate. So, in place of action, there's plenty of sex. Some viewers will understand this, like me, but will still have a hard time accepting it. Therefore, those fans who prefer lighter, ""cleaner"" romantic comedy will probably have to turn to Hallmark instead of Hollywood, if this film is an example of the ""future world"" of light romance. I hope its not so."

","Friends With Benefits, while good, serves as one of many 2011 sizable disappointments next to Bad Teacher. Maybe I don't like this type of cliché storytelling, but I think what is partially to blame is that the film is marketed like a laugh-out-loud comedy, when really, it's more or so made up of the occasional chuckle and the rom-com parody that is more clever than funny. Still, it is in no way bad, just misleading and expected.<br/><br/>The big thing with this film that I found very smart and very effective is its cast. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are some of today's hottest celebrities. Timberlake is popular with the ladies, and Mila Kunis is popular with the men (I am no exception). Not to mention, we get cameos by Emma Stone and The Lonely Island's Andy Samberg. If this isn't an ensemble comedy cast, I don't know what is.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, when thinking of this film, the film No Strings Attached comes to mind which came out earlier this year. I say big deal. If we can have multiple superhero films come out this year, each one dopier than the next, multiple comedies about grown men trying to have sex, and even CGI-ed Alvin in the Chipmunks, Garfield, and The Smurfs, I don't see why two films focusing on the same topic, asking the same question can't be made.<br/><br/>The plot is as simple as it has ever been. Dylan (Timberlake) is an art director who works in Los Angeles. Jamie (Kunis) is an Executive Recruiter who tries to recruit Dylan for GQ Magazine. Both have been recently dumped, and miss sex, but don't feel the problems that follow sex are worth it. Dylan and Jamie meet, they become close, and they both agree they are emotionally complex in some way. So they decide to have casual sex, no feelings, nothing personal, just sex. They swear on the Bible - iPad that is.<br/><br/>Dylan meets and befriends the sports writer for the magazine, Tommy (Harrelson) who is one of the funniest characters in the film. He gives Dylan advice like a straight man, when really he thinks a man and a woman together is ""creepy."" This film is funny, but not as funny as it suggests. It is better than No Strings Attached by a little. For one thing, it treats its characters like human beings and not just ""Man"" and ""Woman."" Not to mention, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are clearly having fun with their characters.<br/><br/>The humor, most of it coming from Kunis, comes natural and isn't forced. But I would've thought more laugh-out-loud moments came out of this picture. The trailer suggests this was nonstop comedy from two shining stars. I only recall laughing-out-loud twice in this film, and I dare not speak the scenes.<br/><br/>Vulgarity in Friends With Benefits is one thing it does right. It has a lot of it, but enough of it. It isn't in every sentence, yet it isn't squeaky clean. Plus, it's always fun to see a couple having a serious conversation throwing in swear words like fourteen year olds.<br/><br/>I liked Friends With Benefits, but I left disappointed. Maybe this formula is near-impossible to freshen up because of the inevitable outcome everyone sees coming from the moment they sit down in the theater. It's not a bad thing to be cliché, especially in a time like this where it's hard to avoid. It just doesn't work in the film's favor. There are scenes where the film tries to parody other rom-coms, and is successful at that. But what this boils down to is a good comedy, with a disappointing effect. It gets us where we need to be, but then says ""eee, uhh. I'm done."" Starring: Justin Timberlake, Mila Kunis, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Andy Samberg, and Richard Jenkins. Directed by: Will Gluck."

","Hmmm...so, I had hopes for this one. Justin and Mila are both hot and they have great chemistry...when they're not on screen. <br/><br/>I actually liked ""No Strings Attached"" more, though not by much more, but it was more believable. A better movie, in my opinion, is actually ""Love & Other Drugs"" which I thought would be like watching a poodle crap through a window while I eat my lunch. However, it surprised me.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the movie was fun...but it got caught in that last week's Velveeta (not even respectable cheese) crap.<br/><br/>See this movie if you:<br/><br/>1. Genuinely want to compare it with ""No Strings Attached""<br/><br/>2. Can appreciate the long-term benefit in seeing Mila Kunis exposed<br/><br/>3. Really don't want a relationship with the guy you're dating<br/><br/>Also men...avoid this movie like the plague if the girl you're hoping to sleep with imposes a ""5-Date Rule"" on you. Let her watch it after you've made it to date 5 and then stop calling her.<br/><br/>(5/10 stars) Self-Stimulation has more benefits, but this'll do."
