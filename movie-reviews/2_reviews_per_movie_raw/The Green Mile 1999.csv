"KathyT","10","556","603","15 December 1999"," As wonderful as the book!
","""The Green Mile"" is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times.  I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen.  Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King's ""Shawshank Redemption"" to the screen.  He does the same high quality work with ""The Green Mile"".  The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway.  The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison.  His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book.  The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that.  I can't understand the complaints.  The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long.  The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing.  Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes. ""The Green Mile"" will haunt you."

","i expected this movie to be a normal and i just want to see it for Tom Hanks but as movie goes through i cry,i laugh and there comes a feeling which can't be described in words. i rate this movie as the best i have ever seen. some moments in the movie makes me hold my bed pillow in the tightest ever grip. i can guarantee that this movie will leave an impression in your mind for a long time. i even say that this movie is better than shawshank redemption.fantastic story, brilliant acting,mind boggling feelings and overall an unforgettable drama. if you have watched 1000 movies and not this then your movie watching journey is incomplete.i will also make sure that even my next generation should watch this one."
"alan photog","10","634","715","9 January 2000"," Film was invented for creations like this.
","The Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best. The depth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering excellent performances. There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. He brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.<br/><br/>The Green Mile should bring you joy, laughter, and if you are like most in the theater this night, tears.<br/><br/>BRAVO!"
"Matt-231","Null","286","321","15 December 1999"," True to the book, which is odd for a movie.
","Having seen the movie, The Green Mile, and read the novel of the same  name by Stephen King, I am glad to say that the movie stays true to the  book, which in itself is a great read.  I read the book in one setting about a year ago, and after seeing the  movie, I didn't see one scene from the book, or one plot point, left  out. There were a few minor changes from the book but which in no way  detract from either work.  As far as performances, I can imagine many people pointing to Michael  Duncan as John Coffey or Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb as the best  performances of the movie, and they are good, but I would hope that  Michael Jeter would receive recognition for portraying Eduard  Delacroix. He plays Delacroix exactly as I pictured him when I read the  book.  I can very well see why King himself said this is his favorite of the  movies adapted from his novels. It is the only one played out as he had  written it.  I wouldn't compare this movie or the book to (Rita Hayworth and) The  Shawshank Redemption because that would be unfair to both. They are  both great, but are both different. The Green Mile isn't a movie about  hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie  about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects.  But like The Shawshank Redemption, I give The Green Mile 4 out of 4  stars. Great story, great cast, great look."
"uniikki","10","373","423","10 February 2000"," A rare gem of casting and direction.
","Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at ""the mile"" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.<br/><br/>A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is coloured by this.  Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan.<br/><br/>It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camerawork is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation.<br/><br/>All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. Five out of five."

","THE GREEN MILE (1999) ****<br/><br/>Starring: Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Doug Hutchison, and Gary Sinise Written and directed by Frank Darabont. Running Time: 180 minutes. Rated R (for scenes of strong disturbing violence, language, and some sexuality)<br/><br/>
By Blake French:<br/><br/>	It's not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. ""The Green Mile"" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by  Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. ""The Green Mile"" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe.  <br/><br/>The story is more of a personal narrative than an actual plot. The film offers an interesting perspective of the events that take place. It is seen through the eyes of a man who is over one hundred years of age, Paul Edgecomb, who is currently living in an old folks home with his friend, Elaine. During a very emotional day for Paul, he tells Elaine of a historical year in his experiences. She listens closely to his story.<br/><br/>He tells of a particular year in the 1930's. The setting is a beautifully crafted prison hall. Paul explains he used to be a kind prison guard on death row in charge of overseeing the executions. In this year, several significant activities occurred in his life: he had a terribly painful urinary infection, and met a prisoner named John Coffey. This man has been sentenced to the electric chair for the rape and murder of two innocent little girls. This man isn't like anyone else Paul has seen, however. Aside from being massive in size, he is humble, mild mannered, and caring. After several miraculous events take place that may point to the thought that John Coffey might have magical powers from God, Paul begins to doubt the crimes this so called criminal has been convicted of. <br/><br/>	Throughout the story we witness three executions that in an electric chair. These capital punishment sequences have much power and significance. The electrocutions, one in particular, contain some of the most unsettling, disturbing material in film history. The movie is anti death penalty; we see the sometimes sadistic world from the prisoner guards point of view. It will put you in their shoes--and perhaps, change your opinion on the death penalty. I certainly had to think about my stand on this issue.<br/><br/>
I did have questions that were not really answered by the filmmakers. I wanted more on John Coffey's magical powers; the miracles aren't investigated enough to suit our pleas. I think the movie could have also stood on a firmer platform of religion. We assume that Coffey's abilities are a gift from God from the character's dialogue, but religion itself is more of a theme in the film than a message or plot point. I can perfectly see why the writers decided to leave these elements to the audiences imagination, to provoke participation. So I suppose my objections are not really flaws, just personal aspirations.<br/><br/>""The Green Mile"" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from ""American Beauty"" in the best performance of 1999. <br/><br/>
The message to ""The Green Mile"" is clear and understandable: justice isn't always just and the miracles can happen in the most unexpected of places. This film is one of the most penetrating dramas of the past several years. It will induce your mind to think about its subjects, and gradually build on you. ""The Green Mile"" is a movie that will stick with you long after the ending credits role by. <br/><br/>Brought to you by Warner Bros."
"thomaseb","10","151","182","31 January 2000"," Amazing and captivating rendition of the novel.
","The length of the movie was perfect. It kept to the story to an amazing degree. The few changes didn't hurt the feeling nor the telling. The story itself is stirring and captivating. The casting of the parts and their portrayal were right on. This is one of the best movie versions of a Steven King novel I've ever seen, and I think I've seen them all. If you're prone to tears at a film, take extra tissues, you'll need them. The theater I was in was a mass of sniffles through the end credits. If you like fantasy/drama the film cannot be missed. There are some graphic scenes that may upset some, but this is Steven King. This is a movie I plan to add to my video collection as soon as the Letter Box version hits the shelves."
"epluribusunum2010","10","35","39","5 September 2012"," Rest in Peace Michael Clarke Duncan
","There's a reason why this Oscar winning tour de force is #67 ranked of all films on IMDb, despite the fact that it's 3 hours long and has some truly grisly scenes (not for the squeamish, children, or a first date.)<br/><br/>It's chock full of outstanding performances, not only from Hanks, but also from the many supporting characters, all who are rich and full. It will seem slow to the impatient, but will be richly rewarding for those with the stamina to make it to the end. <br/><br/>It will certainly get you thinking about capital punishment and perhaps different shades/degrees of evil. It is either a deeply moving spiritual tale or a wonderfully creepy journey down the rabbit hole of Stephen King's mind; take your pick. Either way, I put it right up there on my desert island list with the likes of Shawshank Redemption. It is definitely required watching."
"jlacerra","10","219","275","17 June 2001"," A one of a kind classic
","This movie is a real gem.  It is hard to find fault with it.  Hanks is excellent in a role that clearly calls for him to suppress his natural slant toward humor.  He is Paul Edgecomb; Tom Hanks is nowhere to be found.  Yet he gives Edgecomb just the right flavor.  One cannot find a single weak cast member!  Michael Jeter should have got an Oscar.  Michael Clark Duncan put just the right shading on his huge character to make him vulnerable and sympathetic.<br/><br/>Flawlessly shot on perfect period sets, the whole production binds together to bring the extraordinary story into the realm of a believable and compelling study of human injustice and charity."
"schd5","10","179","228","17 January 2000"," Mesmerizing & Thought Provoking
","Without using all the old cliches, I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in a creative, intriguing, and life enhancing experience. Everything about this movie was delightful. I recommend seeing this movie with someone especially close to you. After the movie my FiancÃ©e and I spent two hours talking and expanding on the films ideas and concepts. This was truly a electrifying experience. I would venture to call this movie one of the best movies of all time.  Sure, there are things that I would have liked to see done differently, but that is what makes a movie more enjoyable. The discussions following this film were wonderful."

","I went looking for an experience. Something that would take me to the limits of my own existence and remind me that even in the darkest corner of my own life, there was hope. I was reminded, instead that along with the triumph there must also be sacrifice. A part of me died in that theater, but I walked out feeling renewed, refreshed...and a little cursed.<br/><br/>I think Paul Edgecomb feels the same way.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks has to be the epitome of a Hollywood living legend...and the guy's only in his 40s. He went from scraping his way through sophomoric slap like The 'Burbs, Turner & Hooch, and Bachelor Party to rise up in the 90s as our towering ""everyman.""  Anyone who marvels in his ""simple guy in complicated circumstances"" roles such as Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan knows that he can deliver the goods...and an Oscar nomination (or win...or two...in a<br/><br/>ROW!!!)  But Tom does something very interesting in The Green Mile.  He lays back.<br/><br/>The breakout performance in this film goes to Michael Clark Duncan (right now tied with Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osment for my Best Supporting Actor vote).  Crippled by his size, Mr. Duncan has a limit of the roles he can play. However, given the role of a child-like behemoth with Christ-like powers of healing, Duncan brings to the screen a performance that will transcend the Denzels and the Poitiers of the world.<br/><br/>The Green Mile is Cell Block E in a Louisiana State Prison, death row. Paul Edgecomb run this wing with compassion, a startlingly different approach considering the legendary cruelty of southern prisons.  He is surrounded by men in him employ who all share his philosophy that these men ultimately await the most devastating punishment.  Why make their stay any more troubling.<br/><br/>All save one: Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchinson), relative of the Governor and always ready to remind anyone who disagrees his HIS methods just who got him his job. Percy hates everything about The Green Mile; the prisoners, other guards, even a tiny, brave mouse who befriends one of the inmates (Michael Jeter).  It isn't until another new inmate is processed, a man they call ""Wild Bill"", that Percy will meet his equal.<br/><br/>So where is the common thread? What is a messianic character doing on death row? What role will Tom Hanks play in his redemption? And what's this ""curse"" thing I brought up in the beginning of this review?<br/><br/>If I could tell you, you wouldn't slap the money down on the box office and find it for yourself.  Let me just tell you that the final blessings bestowed by John Coffey (Duncan) could make optimists and pessimists alike find a common ground. How you perceive the final moments will be up to how you impart on yourself...and the world.<br/><br/>If John Coffey guilty of his crime?  Are the fates of the characters in this film deserved?  Half and half.  Evil is punished, bu t goodness must bare witness...and that has a price as well.  Will Tom Hanks win another Academy Award?  He shouldn't.  Is this a good film?  No.  It's an incredible film.<br/><br/>I still weep for Paul Edgecomb."

","Having doubts about seeing this movie because of the length (3 hours can be death to a film).I was so surprised that I didn't look at my watch once throughout the whole movie. Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie.

","The Shawshank Redemption is possibly my favorite movie ever. I had seen many movies before it, and I've certainly seen a lot after, but not many of them made me feel what that one did. Now, I have that feeling again. And once again, it comes from watching a Frank Darabont movie. I couldn't possibly explain the overload of emotions I experienced in the 3 hours it lasts. I have laughed. I have felt the emotions of every character. And most of all, I have cried. Very few movies have touched me like this one. Is there something to say about the acting that hasn't been said before? No, it isn't. You may have heard it is flawless, incredible, whatever. You did hear right, it absolutely is. I can't think of anyone in the whole movie that wasn't convincing in the least. The script has its funny moments, but it's incredibly deep, poignant and heartfelt. The characters are so ""human"" and unpretentious you can't help but adore them. But, well, there will be some you'd like to strangle. There has to be a villain everywhere, right? The Green Mile is a movie I will hardly forget. You can't possibly forget such an emotive story.<br/><br/>What, you want to watch it? Great! But don't forget to have grab some tissues first."

It's long, but the time flies.<br/><br/>Hanks is superb here as is the inspired choice of Michael Clarke Duncan and in fact all of the cast. Even the mouse was brilliant!<br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/><br/>It's the story of a simple man wrongly convicted of the worst type of crime. Set in a time where there is no real recourse to justice for such men and with a subplot that becomes the main focus of the film. Is John Coffey a gift from God and if so why are we allowing him to be legally murdered?

","The world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner of men are housed. Because these men are said to have committed a crime, the places are manifest and most men serving there, have earned their stay. However, as history has shown, there are innocent men incarcerated as well. Occasionally, one of these innocents are not only imprisoned, but are further remembered because their life becomes legend. In this case, the realization is nothing short of incredible as the new prisoner is a natural empath. Steven King the prolific American horror writer, chronicles this unusual story in a Louisanna prison where one Joe Coffee, (Michael Clarke Duncan) a huge, nay, enormous Black man, having been convicted of murder, is sentenced to be executed, by electrocution. Tom Hanks( And Dabbs Greer) plays Paul Edgecomb, an aging Prison Guard, who recalls his years in the state prison. Working on 'Death Row' or "" The Green Mile "", Mr. Edgecomb recalls Mr. Coffee's arrival and the strange events during his stay. With sympathetic Guards, like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery Demunn and one particular sadistic guard called Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb recollects his discovery of the man's unusual healing powers and the surprising revelations concerning his innocence. The story is crafted by Steven King and it's application to the silver screen is perhaps one of the finest adaptation ever done. Duncan is magnificent and has a superb ability to allow the audience to learn his true purpose. Were it not for the sadistic behavior of Hutchison, who earned his ultimate reward, the story would not have carried it's genuine sympathetic awe which gave this movie it's Classic status. A great film and a must for true movie fans. ****"

","Until I saw 'the Green Mile', I always thought that the 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'Forrest Gump' were the two saddest movies that I ever saw, but this movie actually blew me away for good.<br/><br/>'The Green Mile' tells the tale of a few prison officers whose life changes when a supposed rapist/murderer gets sent to the prison they are in. During this time, they come to realize that he has a mysterious power that can be used for good and that the man may truly be innocent of all accused crimes.<br/><br/>I love every single thing about 'the Green Mile', the same way I loved everything about 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'Forrest Gump'. The acting in the movie was just perfected on all corners. Tom Hanks brilliantly portrays the complex character of Paul Edgecomb and the late Michael Clarke Duncan absolutely steals the show in an Oscar robbed performance as John Coffey. May he ever rest in peace. It wasn't, however, just those two who gave strong performances. The actors playing Brutus, Hal, Del, Percy, Wharton all did an unbelievable job at portraying how realistic prison life may truly be.<br/><br/>The story is so emotionally moving that it is impossible to not like and connect with. The characters presented in the movie are some of the finest movie characters that I've ever seen. This film truly mastered characters and what they undergo during prison life.<br/><br/>The directing and writing by Frank Darabont, the man behind 'The Shawshank Redemption' absolutely masters everything a film needs to get right once more and adds such layers to each character that we come to truly love by the end of the film.<br/><br/>The tone to the movie is so dark that we are immediately thrown into the world presented in this movie. The movie is so sad on many occasions that I was truly left bawling my eyes out.<br/><br/>**Spoilers*** The scene where Del is horribly executed to death was just too sad to look at. This movie made me sympathize with criminals more than any other movie.<br/><br/>The last half hour made me truly cry all the way through it. The film doesn't attempt to out do itself and just masters it all. The ending to the movie just continued to make me cry.<br/><br/>John Coffey's death is perhaps, the saddest death I've ever seen in movie history. It was such a moving scene that truly made me think twice about life.<br/><br/>***Spoilers ended*** 'The Green Mile' is a superbly acted, directed, written movie with fascinating characters and a moving story that is sure to make everyone cry and be totally glad that they saw this movie. I however, do not think I will ever sit through this 3 hour movie, as I cannot bear to be emotionally connected to these characters. Watching 'The Green Mile' again and again is not easy, but that's a good thing about the movie."

"bkoganbing","10","14","20","7 December 2009"," The Least Of us
","I'm glad that a number of reviewers have informed me that this highly unusual tale was a faithful adaption from the novel by Stephen King. I'm not much of a fiction reader so it is gratifying to hear that his vision got to the screen intact. <br/><br/>I would not have guessed this film would have come from a horror story writer. No monsters from the id or any place else are present in this story set in the American South of the Thirties. But demons do exist in The Green Mile and there is a man named John Coffey who takes them unto himself.<br/><br/>The Green Mile refers to the cell block housing the inmates scheduled for Death Row. In that cell block comes Michael Clarke Duncan who is close to seven feet tall and maybe weighing 400 pounds. He's also as docile as a baby lamb and whose only request is that they leave a night light burning because he gets a little afraid of a strange place in the dark.<br/><br/>Of course the guards who have the typical white Alabama attitudes of the day don't quite know what to make of them, but Tom Hanks who captains the cell block and most of the rest find out just how special he is. And Hanks cannot believe that someone like Duncan could possibly be guilty of a double rape/murder of a child.<br/><br/>This modern day parable of the Jesus story has King telling us that it is very possible that many of his kind have walked the earth with talents for healing. One of them got a religion worked around him, but they can come in all walks of life and certainly no one would expect one to come in the guise of an illiterate black Alabama sharecropper. But one of my favorite Bible verses has Jesus himself saying that what you do unto the least of my brethren you do unto me.<br/><br/>Somebody of Michael Clarke Duncan's size and build is not going to get too many really good roles and he certainly hasn't played anything remotely like John Coffey again. Parts like that don't come along and the film seems almost to have been built around him. It's one of the most moving performance that has ever been put on film in history. And it's an incredibly difficult role, he's meek for his size and Uncle Tom like, but as we learn far from it. In fact Coffey is beyond what the ordinary human mind can comprehend. Duncan received one of four Academy Award nominations that The Green Mile got, in his case for Best Supporting Actor. Since the film is built around him, my only question is why was it the Supporting Actor category?<br/><br/>The Green Mile was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay, but did not come home a winner in any of these. A pity that one of the best films of the Nineties could not get at least one Oscar.<br/><br/>Where there's a Christ-like figure you also have some devil spawn villains and we have a pair of them in Sam Rockwell as another death row prisoner and David Hutchison as a rat of a prison guard with both connections and issues. What happens to them is both poetic and diabolical in true Stephen King tradition. Others in the cast of note are Bonnie Hunt as Mrs. Hanks, James Cromwell and Patricia Clarkson as the warden and his wife, David Morse and Barry Pepper as two other guards on the block and Michael Jeter as another prisoner with a remarkably trained 'circus' mouse.<br/><br/>The Green Mile is a remarkable allegorical picture and might be considered for Easter time viewing if it has a season. It certainly will make folks think."
"Rockford_6","9","10","14","19 August 2008"," A rare gem
","Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie. The Green Mile isn't a movie about hope and friendship, as The Shawshank Redemption was, it is a movie about a miracle of a man, and the people he affects."

"ventery","10","7","9","20 September 2018"," An Emotional Masterpiece!
","There have been a few times in my life when a film moved me to such a degree that I cry for hours after the end credits have rolled... last night was one of them. I avoided watching The Green Mile for years after my very first experience left me crying for a whole week and experiencing intense nightmares about it. One could say that I was probably not emotionally ready to handle a movie of this magnitude and while the emotions I experienced were very real to me, I never grasped the underlying messages and couldn't understand the symbolism.<br/><br/>As a matured adult I experienced the film very differently. On the surface level, this film is about the brutal murder of two young girls which led a black man to be falsely accused of the crime and sentenced to death. The film delves into the relationships formed between the prisoners and the officers in charge, and the realization that he may be innocent of the crime. However, beneath the surface, the film is riddled with deep symbolism that makes it incredibly difficult to watch.<br/><br/>The selection of cast members for this movie was expertly chosen - each one bringing a new layer of humanity to the overall story. Tom Hanks was breath-taking in his portrayal of Paul Edgecomb, the head guard on the mile who was greatly affected by the magical presence of John Coffey. Tom captured Paul's inner struggles beautifully and brought the character to life. <br/><br/>The late Michael Clarke Duncan, who played John Coffey was mesmerising and I could not take my eyes off of him. His muscular physique and rough exterior made him perfect for the role but it was his ability to embody the mysterious and often naive nature of John Coffey's character that should have won him an Oscar. His character's growth throughout the film and his ultimate realisation that the only way to escape this unpleasant life is to go through with his execution are what made him so heart-wrenching to watch. <br/><br/>Moreover, the underlying symbolism in this movie was expertly hidden and handled with care. Most notably was Mr Jingles, the little grey mouse who befriended inmate Edward Delacroix and offered him some relief from the pain he was facing as his impending execution was fast approaching, symbolising the child-like nature of the human spirit and our longing to cling to life. I found their interactions very heart-warming but it was his brutal execution that awoke a sense of hopelessness and sadness in me.<br/><br/>Another example of this was evident in the scene where John Coffey is being led out of the prison to be taken to the house of the Sheriff who's wife was dying of brain cancer; he stops for a moment to look up at the stars and tries to share a story with the officers. Later, as he is being led to a wooded area outside the prison walls, he stops for a moment to smell the leaves on the floor and then offers them to the officers to smell. In both scenes, he portrays both the child-like wonder so many of us have lost and the lack of gratitude that we have for simple things like being able to smell leaves or look up at the stars. <br/><br/>Finally, John Coffey epitomized three of the most beautiful characteristics any person could have: love, compassion and empathy. As I watched his character unfold, I felt drawn to the pain that he was experiencing. If I had to describe my own experience with this life, it would be through John Coffey's famous line: ""I'm tired, boss. Tired of being on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain. I'm tired of never having a buddy to be with, to tell me where we's going to, coming from or why. Mostly, I'm tired of people being ugly to each other."""
"undeaddt","8","3","3","6 February 2019"," Rest In Peace, Michael Clarke Duncan, you legend.
","With this movie Tom Hanks proves why he is one of the all time best male actors that shook the world with their abnormal amazing acting roles. Among the TOP 100 IMDB rated movies, he has probably more than 4-5, including The Green Mile, Forest Gump and Saving Private Ryan, Captain Philips was also an amazing movie. But the spotlight in The Green Mile is reserved for Michael Clarke Duncan in the role of John Coffey. Nobody can count the amount of people that this person made cry in the early 2000's. He is the most adoring male human being that showed up on the movie screen in this century, his acting is out of this world and emotions are leaking out of every cell of his body. The fact that the actor died 7 years ago makes everyone 10 times more sad....rest in piece legend. Above all, we must not forget that this is another movie based on a Stephen King novel that succeded big time, which shows why we may consider King as the best novel writer of all time."

","Frank Darabont directs another masterpiece adapted by a Steven King novel.Sheer brilliance at its finest.Tom Hanks makes perhaps his greatest performance as the corrections officer Paul Edgecombe who doesn't believe in miracles until he sees one.While Tom and the others all shine in their roles I think that Michael Clarke Duncan deserves most credit as his magnificent portrayal of John Coffey-a convicted 8 foot tall giant murderer.He is accused in the killing of two little girls and sentenced to death.With time however Paul starts to wonder if the gentle hearted Coffey really did commit the murder.The movie has so many emotional moments that it's hard not to sympathize with the characters.The deep emotional drama of some of them is mentally pressuring and you become connected with these people - again expertly accomplished by Darabont who perfectly understands the source material and sticks close to it.Like Shawshank before it the movie teaches us the value of human life and how strong each one of us can be.This is achieved here similarly as again there is an innocent man put in prison but unlike Andy John is touched by God.He is a magical being who calls forth sympathy and by the end the audience is so аttached to him that the somewhat tragic ending is quite sad.As his previous movie Mr Darabont creates yet another fantastic film sure to stay in your heart for a while.Steven King should be proud."
"Christian_Dimartino","10","9","13","25 July 2011"," Magical,marvelous, and moving.
","One of the most moving films ever put on screen is director Frank Darabont's The Green Mile, a deep,tragic, and overall wonderful film that teaches lessons, reaches into your heart, and leaves you taken off your feet, and sad.<br/><br/>The Green Mile is told through the eyes of a prison guard named Paul(Tom Hanks) and a year he spent with John Coffey(Michael Clarke Duncan), a death row inmate who has miraculous powers. As the film goes on, you get to know Coffey, and you love him, though, he's impossible to hate.<br/><br/>The Green Mile is one of the most heart wrenching films I have ever seen. Aside from its wonderful story, there are characters here that you grow to love, such as Paul and John, but yet there are characters that you really grow to hate, and that brings me to the unbelievably fantastic performances.<br/><br/>Aside from Duncan's marvelous Coffey, the best performance here is from Doug Hutchinson as Percy, the films most hatable character. He's not the bad guy, but if you've seen this guy you wouldn't be surprised if he was. Percy is an arrogant doushbag, and you really can't stand him. I hated him more than the film's actual villain(not going to reveal).<br/><br/>In 3 hours, Darabont focuses on the characters and the story lines, which I admire. These are some of the best 3 hours I have ever spent. And even though The Green Mile ends on such a sad note, I have to say that I preferred it over The Shawshank Redemption. Sue me, I don't care.<br/><br/>A"

This is not ars gratia artis, art for arts sake; it's art for the sake of humanity; for portraying brilliant stories that center around human interactions in the most inhuman of places. If anyone stumbles on this review, understand that there are few similarly heart-wrenching films out there. Others have pointed out more, and I agree. But these stand out among the rest, and that is indisputable.<br/><br/>If you are a film enthusiast that has not seen these films, or if you are just looking for a great flick, look no further.

","First off, the reason I watched this movie is Michael Clarke Duncan. Almost an year back I read a post in IMDb saying ""The Green Mile actor Michael Clarke Duncan is dead at 54"". I wondered why IMDb mentioned a movie name at a person's death post. I don't know about this movie until his death. So I really wanted to watch this for him. It took almost an year for me to get this movie. <br/><br/>As of movie, actually I lost myself in that movie for like 3 hours. I never knew how to characterize acting until watching this. I mean I didn't think I was watching a movie, actually I felt like it was so real. Tom Hanks played an exquisite role, I personally think if anyone wants to see what acting is, the search ends here. <br/><br/>About Michael Clarke Duncan:- His role actually overshadowed everything in this movie.

It is story about human character,their life and believing...It shows how we react on things that just happen without reason, things that we can't explain even if we see it by our own eyes. It is true like movie tells us- it is difficult to find miracle or better that miracle find us, but if we do, we don't believe in it or worse we destroy(kill) it! Great act by Tom Hanks like always, role of a good family person, who help those around him, person who stands up for his convictions, is written all over his skin, actually whole crew that cared about prison was picked up very carefully and they really made a great entirety...great story by Mr. King...maybe a little unusual for his writing, but one more reason to congratulate him for this one!

","A great cast with great performances and a great story that keeps you hooked all the time and moves you more than once.<br/><br/>I would like to begin this review by stating that I've never read the novel written by Stephen King. So I don't know anything about the similarities or differences between this movie and the novel.<br/><br/>There are many things about this movie that I like a lot. One of those things is the cast, which is a very strong one. Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Barry Pepper, ... All of them have a role that seems to be written especially for them. It's good to see David Morse again, he's one of those actors you commonly see, but never in a leading role. Doug Hutchinson's character is one of the most annoying I've ever seen. But perhaps that's a good thing. He really was great at being annoying. LOL :D<br/><br/>Another thing about this movie which I like a lot is the story which keeps you hooked for the majority of its length. There are many movies out there that have a storyline that are shorter in length that have you glancing at the clock from time to time wondering when the movie will finally end. The Green Mile however, keeps you hooked and makes you curious about what will happen next and further. With a little over 3 hours, this movie only seems too long but doesn't feel that way unlike many others. At least, not when you're into this genre of movies.<br/><br/>This story nearly has it all: it has excitement, drama, love, comedy. One moment you're laughing, the other moment you're feeling compassion with people that are being sent to death. As said, this movie is not about the deathrow, but about the people on it and about the spirituality, mystery and how everything affects the characters that spend their final hours their or work there for a living.<br/><br/>/*** BEGIN SPOILER ALERT ***\ One of the best moments was the final moment with Michael Clarke Duncan on the chair. The sadness you could read from the faces of the guards (Tom Hanks, David Morse, Barry Pepper)... Perhaps it's not correct for them to be like that, but at the same time it is very moving and understanding.<br/><br/>\*** END SPOILER ALLERT ***/ ALl in all, it's a very enjoyable film with a deep story that really takes you along. Within 3 hours I feel like I've witnessed their lives for months. At the end of the movie, when you start looking back at the beginning, you'll probably understand. :) Some characters probably weren't explored that much, but probably with good reason. After all, its a movie about magic, miracles, spirituality. And the persons involved with that have to be mysterious in some ways.<br/><br/>This is probably one of the best films I've ever seen. My rating for it: 4 1/2 out of 5."

","""The Green Mile"" expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama. It was adapted from Stephen King's novel by director/writer Frank Darabont and released in 1999. If you're not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I'm not) DON'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful and spiritually-profound film; ""The Green Mile"" is by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes.<br/><br/>THE STORY: Tom Hanks plays the head Death Row guard at a Tennessee prison during the Depression. A new inmate is introduced, a hulking black man named John Coffey (exquisitely played by Michael Clarke Duncan), who is condemned to death for the rape and murder of two little girls. Hanks and his guard friends slowly become intrigued by the seemingly pure-hearted giant and begin to realize that he is eminently gifted in a decidedly supernatural way; they conclude that there's no way he could be guilty of the crime. If that's the case, who is guilty? And will the guilty party get away with it.<br/><br/>""The Green Mile"" is a 3-hour film, way over my limited attention span, and yet it is somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings. The film is character/dialogue driven, unique and wholly unpredictable. Please don't mistake this for a run-of-the-mill prison flick. The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue. This is an incredibly powerful supernatural mystery/drama.<br/><br/>*** SPOILER ALERT *** (Don't read this next paragraph unless you want to consider possibilities about the character John Coffey) <br/><br/>John Coffey's last name is, evidently, derived from an ancient Sumerian word, kophi, which means ""winged creature."" Hence, John could be viewed as a angel or messenger from the Almighty. In truth, John is an obvious type of Jesus Christ verified in six ways: (1.) His initials are J.C. (2.) He's completely pure/good-hearted and can easily recognize true evil. (3.) He miraculously heals people. (4.) He pronounces and executes divine judgment. (5.) He is sacrificed even though completely innocent. And (6.) He offers eternal life (in a sense), as evidenced by the extended life-span of the Hanks character and the mouse ""Mr. Jingles."" <br/><br/>*** End SPOILER ALERT *** <br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Make no mistake, ""The Green Mile"" is one of the greatest films ever made. It ranks up there with my 5 or 10 best. Don't miss out on this cinematic masterpiece. Now please excuse me while I wipe the tears from my face."

The supernatural effects in the movie might be unbelievable if you focus solely on them, but I think they're ""metaphoring"" and make things a bit more understandable, maybe. A wonderful movie that moves at a measured pace on to a very unexpected ending. As with most great movies the casting is almost perfect and each character gives added depth to a rich script. Tom Hanks gives another outstanding performance, his supporting actors (particularly David Morse)actually support and enhance his role.

Well, like other death row movies, this one really touched me; ending with people lives, despite what they've done, is a sad subject for me. It must be the most terrifying feeling to know you're going to be killed in a matter of minutes. Preparing yourself for the electric chair might be even worse. As a thrilling Stephen King's story, ""The Green Mile"" brings an innovation-- this time, a character has a special gift of healing people, like a saint. It is indeed beautiful to see that big and apparently bad guy helping people as he can. Filmmakers are mean in this case-- they make you adore the character, just to kill him in the end and let you down.

I also thought it was so sad when they were watching the last movie that the prisoner got to watch before he died, and then Tom Hanks's character started to cry! I also loved how even though the prisoner was huge, he had a heart of gold, and he actually appeared cute and innocent to me during the whole movie. The only con of the movie was it took me a little bit to understand the murder of the little kids that was committed by the insane man in the movie. I also loved when the old Tom Hanks showed the old lady that he was telling the story to the mouse that was still alive.

","My Plot Summary:<br/><br/>The Green Mile, set in the 1930s, is about the mental and physical health effects of working on death row. In this film the guards encounter many different men that have been put to death for various crimes. It isn't until they come across a black gentleman that has been falsely accused of raping and murdering two young girls, that they begin to really have second thoughts about execution. This inmate has the magnificent gift of healing through his faith. A mix of the inmate's gift, and the fact that he is innocent, causes the guards to question whether or not this man should be executed. The situations a person encounters in their profession can affect them for the rest of their lives. Paul Edgecomb, played by Tom Hanks, is the supervisor on death row, a dimly lit, dungeon-like building. Edgecomb has suffered major effects from the many executions that he has taken part in. He encounters a once in a lifetime experience when John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is sent to the Green Mile to await his execution. John Coffey is a very large and intimidating man that is extremely soft at heart. All this man wants is peace in his life from all of the hurt that is going on in the world around him. He has been blessed with the gift of healing. While he tries to help all he can he learns that it is impossible to help everyone. Paul Edgecomb's fellow prison guards are of varying personalities. Brutus Howell, played by David Morse, is a large man who has been given the nickname ""Brutal"" due to his size. In spite of the fact that he is a tall man, and somewhat intimidating, he is a kind man that comes to second guess the ruling for the execution of John Coffey. Percy Wetmore, played by Doug Hutchison, is an all around jerk who is all bark and no bite. This is proved when one of the more violent inmates grabs hold of one of his co-workers while he stands there shaking in his boots. Percy's interaction with the inmates causes John Coffey to dislike him. As a result, John Coffey has decided to ""infect"" Percy with an ailment that he cured a person of. Percy lashes out on another inmate, kills him, and then releases his ""infection."" Percy, in the end, ends up going to a mental hospital.<br/><br/>My Review:<br/><br/>The Green Mile, starring Tom Hanks, David Morse, and Michael Clarke Duncan, is a brilliantly written and produced piece of work. The choice of actors and actresses along with their exquisite performances could not have been better. The lighting and angles made the viewing of the movie a one of a kind experience. The artistic dimness of the lights, and dull colors within the walls of the Green Mile made this film all the more believable. It gives the viewers the sense of doom and dread that is felt by the inmates knowing that their lives are soon coming to an end because of the crimes they have committed. John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, delivered the most convincing, amazing, and overall ground breaking performance in this film. In spite of his extra large stature, Coffey is a kind, soft hearted man who brings a lot of heart-felt emotion to the Green Mile. The attachment that the guards develop to Coffey makes it extremely hard for them to carry out his execution; there was not a dry eye amongst the guards. This film shows that any situation that is encountered in a person's profession, whether it is mental or physical, can affect them for the remainder of their lives. These men face the biggest moral obstacle they will ever come across in their lifetimes. When asked by Paul Edgecomb how he is to answer for the execution of John Coffey, he is assured by the large, gifted inmate that it is OK to execute him, that it will end his pain and he wants it to be carried out. All he wants is to end the feelings he has every day because of all of the violence and hurt in the world around him. This film is, by far, one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time. There was laughter, tears, and amazement throughout the entirety of this film. The performance of the cast of The Green Mile was above and beyond my expectations of a film that deals with a prison setting. Tom Hanks, along with the many other actors and actresses will leave you begging for more. If you have not seen this brilliant piece of work, then it should be added to your list of must see movies for the year because it is guaranteed to please! If you liked Shawshank Redemption you will love this."
"ironhorse_iv","9","4","6","5 August 2013"," Frank Darabont's Green Mile goes the extra mile and delivers a great movie.
","I promise you that if you have any humanity in your soul, by the end of watching this movie. You will find yourself weeping, because how moving this movie is. The Green Mile is an amazing movie directed by Frank Darabont who knows a little bit about directing prison movies. His biggest claim to fame was 1994's Shawshank Redemption, a prison movie adapted from a Stephen King novel. So it was no surprise that Frank and Stephen King would once again team up to bring audiences another great movie. Can lightning strike in the same place twice? Yes! Set in the Deep South rather than the north this time, Green Mile takes place in Louisiana's prison during the Great Depression. The film really captured the era. Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecombe, a prison guard that works at a quarter of the prison whom job is to execute the inmates. The job is hard and tough. He became to question himself, and his job when a new inmate came named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a simple minded giant whom works more like a miracle worker than a murderer. I have to say what a great cast! Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey was amazing. The way he can pull the audience in, with his delivery is just spell bounding. I got his 'broken glasses' and 'he kill them with they love' speech. I think this encompasses a major theme, how people are ugly and cruel to each other, and justice is only sometimes given. Everything about him, speaks John Coffey from the way he handle miracles, and even the child like innocents when playing with a pet mouse name Mr. Jingles. David Morse as Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell is a great supporting character that helps Paul with his job. I really liked his performance as the strong- will, second in command officer. Then there is Dough Hutchison as Percy Whetmore - he plays a great weasel. He captured Percy's cowardice, arrogance, and violence perfectly as the crudest of the guards. Last, worth noting is Sam Rockwell. He was a little older than how I imagined the criminal Wild Bill to be. He did bring some good humor to the film. I do find the moon pie scene hilarious. A lot of critics have panned the film for not having realistic characters. The characterizations on the death row inmates don't really seems like they belong there. Honestly, does anybody think Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) even commit a crime? He seems way too old to be really a murderer, even Arlan Bitterbuck (Graham Greene) didn't seem so bad. Then you got Percy, the immature sadistic, racist, creep, painted here as being nothing less than 100% evil. Not 50% evil, not 80% evil. But 100% evil. Is that realistic? Is it? Does this guy have even a single redeeming feature? Nope, not one. So I'm not buying this guy either. The characters were way too good or just plan evil with little to no character development. I think it's OK to have film like that, and how the characters were portrayed, I think it was very accurate to the book. In the book, I had a hard time telling the other guards Harry (Jeffery DeMunn) and Dean (Barry Pepper) apart, so I'm glad in the movie, Dean was considerably older than Harry. The biggest change from the book is the racism in the South. I honestly think they toned it down in the movie, the n-word is used plenty of times in the book. Another thing that the movie didn't put was the short story about old Paul in Georgia Pines with a cruel employee that reminded him of Percy. Adding this to the movie would have made it too long, it was already three hours, but it definitely gave his elderly age some more depth. The movie did add some new things to help the film. I think the repeated visual of the light bulbs bursting during Coffey's bursts of power added to the story since we couldn't get inside of Paul's head. I also thought Coffey showing Paul what he saw as opposed to Paul going to investigate was a good move for the film - it shortened the film that was needed badly. Another thing that angry some critics, was the ""Christ"" like symbolism with John Coffey. People says it was too much messianic overtones in the story but it's absolutely ludicrous. As a Christian man, I wasn't offended by it. People need to be open to all beliefs to get this film. Once you get pass that, you find John Coffey to be a very interesting lovable guy, and you get emotional invested in him to the point that you cry when you see what happen in the end with his character. Then there are those people that mad because the movie is way too long. Not that that is always bad, but it didn't help things at all here. If this movie had been the standard flick, but I will defend this movie because the Green Mile is supposed to seem too long. It was even quote in the film. Anybody who read the book, should have known that. The music by Thomas Newman is amazing. It fits in with the mood of the film. Even the song from 1935's Top Hat work in this film. Overall: I really enjoyed this movie. I can understand why it was nominated for a Best Picture at the Academy Awards. An amazing story. Sad emotional for sure, but a lot of great stories are. BTW- RIP Michael Clarke Duncan. You were a great actor."

","Frank Darabont, the extraordinary director of the hit ""Shawshank Redemption"", comes back to the big screen with yet another adaptation of another prison drama novel by Stephen King. This time, the story is ""The Green Mile"", and this time he has the help of Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan joining a powerful cast that also includes Bonnie Hunt, Michael Jeter, and Sam Rockwell. The movie stars Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, an officer on death row, with a serious bladder infection, who rounds up a new suspect named John Coffey, portrayed by Michael Clarke Duncan, a man with mysterious immortality powers, that may have been accused for the raping and killing of two innocent girls. The movie follows as a dramatic and entertaining tale of hope, faith, and courage. Darabont brings back the lucky charm used in ""Shawshank"", but this time he combines real life with fantasy, and creates a story of miracles and dreams. Anyways, the film has powerful backgrounds, and the film focuses on the story with lots of drama and thrills, and the script is more well-written since Shawshank was well-written. The special effects are amazingly realistic, and the story is like a special charm from the heart. I really enjoyed this film, and it's fun to watch it again and again. You will enjoy it so much, you will start to wonder where the 3-hour running time has gone. ""The Green Mile"", in my review, ""an exhilarating prison drama, truly watchable""."
"AnglsBbgrl","Null","4","6","12 December 2002"," Wonderful, Moving to Tears...
","I love this movie, and I have seen it a couple times. It doesn't matter that I know what is going to happen or that I know the movie like the back of my hand, I cry endlessly every single time. I watched it again last night. My boyfriend and I bought it, and he had never seen it. So we sat down to watch the movie, and I realized how truly emotionally moving this movie is.<br/><br/>IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE ENTIRETY OF THE MOVIE DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER DOWN...<br/><br/>The characters in this movie really hit home. You fall in love with these men that are on death row..(all except for ""Wild Bill""). You don't know what on earth they have done, yet it is so bad that they are on death row, and you fall in love with them. You can't help it. I sat there last night, propped up on my pillow in the bed and watched and fell in love with this huge beast of a man that is convicted of raping and murdering two girls. (I knew from the get-go that he didn't do it). And I watched and fell in love with Dale, a French, homosexual, crazy, mouse-loving man. I watched him fall in love with Mr. Jingles. I grew into this hate for Percy ""WET""more (I still get a kick out of that name). And when it came time for Dale to be executed, I cried like I was losing a family member. It was so hard to watch this happen! My boyfriend had to pause the movie, just to check on me. I sat there for five minutes, crying so hard. Then the same thing for John Coffey, I couldn't even watch him be persecuted. I sat beside my boyfriend, face buried in his chest weeping every tear out of me. It was so awful. I have NEVER in my life had a movie effect me like the way this one does. It is a brilliant movie, and the characters chosen for each role could not have been better portrayed if this was a true story, with the real-life people playing their own parts. Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor, and personally I think he does his best when he is acting as a southern authority figure. He is such a convincing actor, along with everyone else in this movie. Props to the actors, director, and Stephen King, you all are wonderful!"
"bob the moo","Null","14","35","8 March 2003"," Overlong and too worthy but still a good story  just don't expect it to be anything like Shawshank 2!
","Now a resident in a rest home, one time head warden on death row, Paul Edgecomb, is struggling with his untold memories.  When a film brings it all back to him he recounts the story of the time when a huge black prisoner called John Coffey was put into wing.  It is not too long before the peaceful, loving prisoner, found guilty of the rape and murder of two children, has mysterious gifts that transcend the decay of the lives around the prison.<br/><br/>After Shawskank Redemption I was attracted to this as many of the makers were the same not to mention the author, the prison setting and the running time.  However that same running time and some negative reviews put me off and I didn't get round to seeing it till recently.  The film is very slow and this is occasionally to it's detriment but not too often.  It's main failing is that it's supernatural spin makes it difficult to get involved and lose yourself in completely.  `Redemption's ` strength was that it was a human story.  Green Mile tries to have the strength of human spirit at it's core but it doesn't quite come off.<br/><br/>That's not to say that the story still isn't moving and involving because it is.  However it doesn't come as easily as it should and when the story slows a little bit it does feel slow.  It could easily have lost 30 minutes as at it's current  length it feels like a long movie which is a bad thing  Two Towers is long but didn't FEEL long!  Also something I always find annoying is when a score really works the emotion where the actual film can't manage it by itself  here the score is working overtime to wring every drop of emotion from the scenes.<br/><br/>The film is very well directed and there are powerful moments of cruelty. When the chair is used I couldn't help but feel that it was real.  However the main attraction (other than the mouse!) is a wonderful performance by Duncan.  True there is an element of slave cliché about it but he rises above that a gives a performance of such emotion and such gentleness that came as a surprise from someone of his build.  Hanks is also good and wisely plays it quite low-key and the support cast is solid, comprised of many many well known faces including Morse and Cromwell.<br/><br/>Overall this is good but overlong.  It is a very different film from Shawshank and many will compare it to that much better film.  However the film is worth the work despite some simplistic errors and flaws."

"Deanjones1970","10","4","7","14 November 2012"," A soon to be classic movie.
","The Green Mile was definitely one of the best movies of the year. With the character driven storyline, all of the characters played well, to the mix of joy, laughter and sadness. This is one of those movies where every single actor puts their all into their craft. It was interesting that this was taken from a book that Steven king wrote being that it seems he writes a lot of horror and thriller books. I did not get a chance to read the book but i have heard it is almost perfectly taken from the book with just a few parts taken out that didn't improve the movie. Some people have complained that it was too long around 3 hours but i believe that is what made it even better. the way the story flowed and the skills of the actors the movie did not feel like it was slow and dragged on. The movie wasn't about the friendships on the green mile but it was more of a miracle of a man and the people he effects. When Michael Clarke Duncan's character gets convicted of a crime and is placed on the green mile everyone is in awe of not just his size but how humble and mild mannered he is. When a few miraculous events take place the guards start to think he has magical powers gifted to him from god. With all the things the happened and his attitude the guards start to doubt that he did the crime he has been convicted of. The message I got from this was that there is clear that there is injustice and the miracles can happen in the unexpected of places. One thing I also noticed was the depiction of the relationship of the guards and inmates. They all seemed like friends they seem to have been treated with respect and dignity and because of that they seemed to not have as many problems that you may have in other prisons. Weather that was because of the beliefs of King or the director or both that we should treat our prisoners better so that they don't end up back in prison and not as violent while they are in it. This film will get you to think about its subjects and gradually build on you. This will be a movie that will be hard to forget even after the credits have ended."
"Britwebber","10","4","7","11 August 2011"," Wow, just wow.
","Wow is all I can say. Let's see... I was only a mere nine years old when this movie came out in 1999. I had always known that ""The Green Mile"" was a good movie -- all I knew was that it featured a large black man and I can remember people talking about it. Now, at 21, I took the time to actually watch this movie last week and am completely blown away. A little late... maybe. But it just proves that this is a timeless piece of work that will continue to be viewed through the decades.<br/><br/>I won't go over the plot because most other reviews have already done so.<br/><br/>But first off, the acting. Incredible. Never did I for one second doubt these characters. And for once, every single cast member did a fantastic performance. I will admit that I have always been a Tom Hanks fan but he outdid himself in this movie. I think it's his best performance by far, beating out Philadelphia by a nose and Forrest Gump. Just a stellar job well done.<br/><br/>*Spoiler* The scene in which John Coffey crabs Paul Edgecomb's hand, you can see and feel the pain right along with them. That has got to be one of my favorite scenes from any movie.<br/><br/>The only actor that could have even done a better job than Hanks would be Michael Clarke Duncan. A better actor could not have been cast for that role.<br/><br/>There is just something so magical about this film. Initially, seeing that it was over 3 hours, I thought it may be a bit long. It never felt like 3 hours and certainly every scene was necessary. After watching a modified television version tonight, I realized that EVERY single minute of that film was so important and none could be cut to get the full effect of the movie.<br/><br/>I have watched this 4 times within the past 2 weeks and that says something right there.<br/><br/>I am not a good movie reviewer but felt compelled to write one about this flick. It's just simply amazing, THIS is what movie making is about, and it's so rare to watch a film such as this. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and buy the DVD! It's a must have to any collection."

","I must say, i gotta commend this movie for its emotionally raw portrayal of death row guards. The characters, for the most part, show remorse for what they do in their daily jobs with the 1 exception being Percy Wetmore. he is a sadistic bastard worthy of any top 10 evil people lists. My favorite scenes are:<br/><br/>1) the mouse hunting scene 2) the bit where john coffey first arrives & asks if they leave the lights on 'cos hes afraid of the dark 3)eduard delacroix's execution 4)the line, ""my names John coffey"" ""like the drink?""

"yuenw003","10","4","7","7 March 2006"," Archetypal biblical-like theme of human nature
","I think this movie addresses a universal theme that's almost biblical in nature: Man is basically evil. He will manufacture and rationalize in his own way to distort good (in this case a good man named John Coffey) into evil (Jesus Christ suffered the same fate.) The question pose by this movie as we identify with the main character prison guard Paul Edgecomb(Tom Hanks) who is in the position as a modern day Pontius Pilate is this: When we are faced with what is told to us and packaged to us as evil, and we discover to the contrary, are we bound to be an agent to evil or do we have the backbone and strength of spirit to expose the wrongdoing and act on our principles for what is right? Life is a test and we will pay a dear price for bad choices with our conscience for the rest of our lives."
"patrickeab","9","4","7","12 February 2006"," An excellent, unusual, disturbing and thought-provoking film
","Without prior knowledge this long, long film threatened me with a late, late night. I started it with prejudice and with reluctance. Prejudice perhaps because the mere idea of death row is horrifying in itself, and to make a movie that is set right in and on death row sounds unappealing - and it is exactly that at first sight. But the quiet dignity of the boss warder (Tom Hanks) is convincing and compelling.<br/><br/>In juxtaposition to the 'quiet man' was the wimpy, nasty little thorn in his side - Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) playing another prison guard. But as a vicious, sadistic little bastard who wants to inflict his own punishment on others because of his warped view of life and his own insecurities. Well enough played for one to develop a keen dislike for him within minutes of clapping eyes on him.<br/><br/>Set in a time not long after Fred Astair and Ginger Rodgers this film plays out the agony of seeing a huge black man brought onto death row as a convicted murderer of two little blond girls. Even his defending council says the he is guilty and never to be trusted - not even for a moment. Implying that if Hanks is foolish enough to trust him he will regret it. Despite that Hanks takes the risk and pays the price in an unexpected way.<br/><br/>This huge black man excellently played by Michael Clarke Duncan cures the ailing Hanks (he has a urinary infection in the days before antibiotics) just by a laying on of hands. Hanks accepts this as a miracle, but he then sees further evidence of this huge, gentle giant's miraculous powers.<br/><br/>With a real sense of claustrophobia the scene of the nasty guard, Percy Wetmore being punished by his fellow guards is not for the squeamish. It will worry me for a time to come.<br/><br/>The agony comes when the black gentle giant carries out further miraculous acts and yet is still not saved from the electric chair. The ironic 'punishment' Hanks receives for not saving him from his execution turns on its head what most of us would value greatly. It is both a sad, and yet at times a darkly humorous film, but at all events not to be taken for granted nor dismissed easily.<br/><br/>For me this was one of the most compelling films I have seen in a long, long time. If you only watch films just to be entertained, don't bother. If you watch films just to be excited, don't bother. If you watch films because you want to be transported to another time and another place and want to experience the moral dilemmas of some good men and to see the actions of some evil men then this will hold your attention from start to finish. You will remember this film as well as you have the Shawshank Redemption."
"Loren-3","10","4","7","30 September 2004"," Ensemble Performance
","Ensemble Performance (n): Wherein all elements of a stage play, film or other suchlike entertainment deliver together, all participants contributing equally as their characters allow, creating a singular and powerful presentation.<br/><br/>The above is my own ""definition,"" if you will, but that's how I feel about The Green Mile. From Tom Hanks to Michael Clarke Duncan to David Morse to Doug Hutchenson in the major roles to elements as small as James Cromwell's warden or Gary Sinese's cameo, no one and I mean NO ONE ""phones it in,"" or merely goes through the motions.<br/><br/>Also appreciated was the pace of the film. Some complain that three hours is too long. I submit that to allow the characters to unfold at the pace of the South in the 1930's, to get the depth and breadth of them, three hours was necessary. For myself, I started watching it of a Saturday evening, thinking I'd ""spot"" through it. The three hours flashed by. Frank Darabont creates the reality of a Louisiana prison in the 1930's, sets the stage with the characters of Paul Edgecomb, Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell, Eduard Delecroix, Arlen Bitterbuck and Percy Wetmore. Into this menage he weaves the magic of a simple black man, John Coffey (""like the drink, only not spelt the same""). The impact Coffey has on Paul Edgecomb, on Warden Moores's wife, on a mouse named Mr. Jingles, indeed on the entire Green Mile ... is a source of wonder in the story-telling that makes this period piece the marvel that it is.<br/><br/>Also very worthy of mention is Thomas Newman's brilliant score, which brings blues and prisoners' chants and multiple flavors and nuances to the table, as much a part of the ensemble as the above-listed characters.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, this is no action-packed, whiz-bang, shoot-em-up piece of eye-candy. It's a beautiful, detailed and subtle piece, not much like any other piece of Stephen King I know of other than ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (which I've yet to see, believe it or not!). And it's a piece I've repeatedly enjoyed for the quality of its production and the power of its performances.<br/><br/>I recommend it heartily. Please enjoy."

This was another of those films I rated very high on the first viewing but lower and lower on the second and third looks, finally eliminating it from my collection. However, that first look was a memorable one because this film had some dramatic moments!<br/><br/>The acting in here is outstanding and runs the gamut from well-known actors like Tom Hanks to several unknowns, all having major roles. It's also nicely filmed. However, the story and the acting are the main attractions. The unique story gets you involved to the point where, even having to watch several very, very unpleasant scenes, you don't want to put the movie down.<br/><br/>Big Michael Clarke Duncan elevated his career a lot with this role, playing ""John Coffey,"" a prisoner with strange powers. You could root for all the characters save two, a sadistic guard aptly named ""Brutus 'Brutal' Howell"" (David Morse) and Warden Hal Moores (James Cromwell). I was sorry to hear Cromwell blaspheme regularly but not surprised since he seems to have played so many ""bad guy"" roles in the past dozen years and done this in other films. With those two exceptions, however, it was nice to finally see prison guards as good guys, something rarely seen since the classic-movie era. Michael Jeter, one of those unknown actors, was a lot of fun to watch as ""Eduard Delacroix.""<br/><br/>Overall, however, as much as I praise this movie, the unpleasant scenes, the high use of the Lord's name in vain and the length of it all make this a tough movie to watch over and over, but it's a movie to definitely see at least once.

"Buddy-51","Null","7","16","14 July 2000"," long superficial tale
","`The Green Mile,' since it is based on a Stephen King novel, emerges as a death row prison story with a sci-fi twist.  Chances are the viewer will either be swept up in this tale of life, death and spiritual renewal involving a group of characters working and languishing in a 1930's prison cell block - or dismiss it as a prime example of sentimental hooey.  Like the similar (and similarly overrated) Stephen King-inspired prison epic, `The Shawshank Redemption,' this new film provides far too sanitary and romanticized a vision of prison life to be either entirely convincing or particularly meaningful.  Indeed, `The Green Mile' goes a step further into the realm of parable by ascribing to one of its main characters the power of miraculous healing.  Unfortunately, however, a parable is, almost by definition, supposed to be short, pithy and to the point.  The story here - which runs a presumptuous 3 hours and 8 minutes - is so overstuffed with subplots and subsidiary characters that it actually works to weaken the emotional effect generated by the plight facing John Coffey, the innocent messenger from God condemned to death, and Paul, the prison guard assigned to run the death row cell block, who comes to learn of Coffey's innocence.<br/><br/>`The Green Mile' certainly has its heart in the right place, but it divides its world too evenly up into good guys and bad guys.  Perhaps the decision to cast Tom Hanks in the leading role of Paul accounts for the fact that the character seems far too genial, soft-spoken and humanistic to be a man dedicating his life to dispatching convicted murderers to their just (or unjust) rewards.  Coffey, a mountain of a man in the form of actor Michael Clarke Duncan, ranks as the oldest cliché of all:  an uneducated, marginally imbecilic lug of a guy whose innocent, childlike heart and mind, though trapped inside a behemoth's body, provide the clean vessel through which God is able to work his wonders.  Except for this last fact, Coffey's pedigree descends from a whole multitude of earlier characters, including Lennie in `Of Mice and Men' and even Frankenstein's monster.  Is this possibly why `The Green Mile,' in deference to the former character, features a mouse in a prominent role?   Similarly, one doubts it is mere coincidence that the crime for which Coffey is convicted is that of raping and murdering two little girls, an echo of Frankenstein  - albeit, in this case, Coffey, of course, is innocent;  after all, having him be guilty of the brutal murders would muddy up the moral waters and make it a lot harder to elicit tears from a sentimental, happily rheumy-eyed audience.   Also, this allows the authors to pound home the Christ figure qualities of Coffey (John Coffey - JC - get it?) to an unsubtle fare-thee-well.  In addition to dying innocently for another's sins, Coffey gets to heal the sick and smite the evildoers (the latter, more in keeping with Jehovah perhaps than with Christ per se).<br/><br/>Nor are the filmmakers much more successful with their villains.  Amidst all this amazing good will between condemned killers and supportive prison guards, there has to be some vinegar to cut the sweetness.  This comes in the form of a too neatly balanced duo, one a guard, the other a far-from-model prisoner.  The guard, Percy, is a craven, sadistic coward who delights in antagonizing the prisoners, taunting and torturing the men at the moment of execution and, most monstrously of all to the animal lovers in the audience, squashing a pet mouse on the eve of its owner's death.  The evil prisoner, Wild Bill, provides a similar two-dimensional quality to his wickedness, serving as a too-obvious foil for the other pure-as-the-driven-snow condemned men.  By so neatly divvying up the characters into clearly delineated categories of good and evil, the filmmakers rob their film of the moral complexity that might have lent it some real meaning.<br/><br/>As to the film's rather startling and, initially unexpected, flights into fantasy, they serve mostly to further soften the edge of this already overly idealistic and mawkish story.<br/><br/>`The Green Mile' is certainly not a `bad' film.  It sports a number of excellent performances, generates some moments of genuine emotional power and, though languorous at times in its pacing, admirably refuses to hurtle ahead as it patiently gathers the strands of its story together.  As with a good long novel, one approaches it with a sense of patience and goodwill. We want to give it the benefit of our attention.  Therefore, we regret even more that the makers of the film too often settle for the easy path of cheap emotionalism and simpleminded sentimentality.  Those of us willing to dedicate more than three precious hours to this particular cause deserve better."

","This was a good- not great- movie. The sad part is that if it wasn't so drawn out, it would have been much better. The acting- particularly Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan- was tremendous. However, the other characters really aren't fleshed out well at all, which is really bad in a three hour plus long movie. ""Shawshank"" it ain't."
"zza99tmk","1","44","154","6 March 2000"," a terrible would-be successor to ""The Shawshank Redemption""
","I really wanted to like this film, I really tried to. But in the end I heavily regretted having seen it and personally I think of ""The Green Mile"" as the first appalling film of this year. This saddens me the more as the director of that film is Frank Darabont who brought us the wonderful ""Shawshank Redemption"". The parallels to his debut from 1994 are obvious: a prison story full of optimism(a friendship between the two main protagonists (one black, one white)) written by the same author (King) and again overlength (this time you've even got a running time of 3 hours+).I would argue that already the story itself is problematic in its conception: the characterisation is implausible. The prisoners (with the exception of one) are all portrayed as good natured men who obviously could do no harm to other people. It makes the fact that they've been sentenced to death for heinous crimes the more unlikely. For a grim and dark place like a prison the green mile is a unusual harmonistic place.This depiction of a prison and the characters is not just naive and almost laughable, it also reminded me of how more realistic and appropriate in such terms ""Shawshank Redemption"" was. People could say that the film generally is not very realistic since John Coffey has supernatural powers but I honestly think that capital punishment is a too serious subject to treat it as an element of a fairy tale. Moreover the film never questions the death penalty, the message rather seems to be that death row is a necessity. Again I was reminded of an another film, Tim Robbins' ""Dead Man Walking"", arguably one of the best and most important american films of the last decade(if you want to see an appropriate and artistic convincing account of the death row, then you're in for a treat).There's basically nothing to say against an optimistic approach when you're talking about such a sad, disturbing and important issue, but what made me really upset about ""The Green Mile"" is the unbearable extent of sentimentality and naivety in the film. Sure, ""Shawshank Redemption"" was emotional, too; but there it felt right, there Darabont managed to find the right tone - here it is just pure kitsch. When Coffey says towards the end something along the lines that people shouldn't treat each other badly and that he wants a peaceful world, I almost started to giggle. Moreover the contrast between the harmonistic, light- hearted scenes with the mouse and the execution scenes doesn't work at all, it destroys the film. Moreover these three scenes (particularly Percys revenge on Delacroix) are not just <br/><br/>disgusting(and believe me, I can really bear a lot),they perfectly fit into this unpleasant mixture of feel good- mentality and pathos. There were good performances in the film (Doug Hutchinson, the ""Polaroid Man"" from Chris Carters ""Millennium"", Michael Duncan Clarke, who made the best out of his cliche role), but in the end I didn't care about the one or two good things I could say about this film. And Tom Hanks? Well, Hanks should really try something new-he's played the clean, good-natured guy so often, that it starts to get on my nerves and not just on mine.I just can't put into words, how much better, how superior ""Shawshank"" was than ""The Green Mile"". The difference is not just striking, it really hurts. When I was watching ""The Green Mile"" I heard people in the audience crying - I was tempted too, but not because I was moved, no, in my case it would have been out of sheer disgust. What a missed opportunity..."
"sdemauri","Null","8","20","21 August 2000"," Fell short if intended to be a Christ allegory
","WARNING - THIS REVIEW CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS<br/><br/>Though this film had its poignant and powerful moments (as well as serving as an indictment of the death penalty), such moments failed to add up to a coherent whole for me, especially if Stephen King and Frank Darabont were intending to make a symbolic parallel (as it seemed they were) between John Coffey and the other ""J.C."" - Jesus Christ.  Whatever their intentions, it was clear that the Coffey character was functioning more as a symbol of innocence in a fallen world than as a ""normal"" flesh- and-blood human being.<br/><br/>However, the film did not really succeed as a redemption story in that the sympathetic ""good"" characters surrounding Coffey remain sympathetic and good, while the unsympathetic ""bad guys"" (i.e. Percy and Wild Bill) remain unsympathetic, or at least ""unredeemed"", as far as what is shown to the viewer.  I suppose one could see Delacroix as a redeemed man, although he's already redeemed when the viewer is introduced to him.  Also, if Coffey is intended to be a Christ-figure, one of the most confusing plot developments (if I am interpreting it correctly) arises when Coffey employs one ""bad guy"" (Percy) as an instrument to kill another ""bad guy"" (Wild Bill) because Coffey had gotten a glimpse into the evil in Wild Bill's heart.  Therefore, one cannot truly see Coffey's death (though presumably undeserved) as a loving substitutionary sacrifice by an innocent one for a guilty one, in that Coffey had already exacted his own judgment on Wild Bill - the ""guilty one"" in the film who ""deserved"" to die.  Such a storyline is not consistent with the biblical story of Christ, in which the innocent Christ bore the judgment that all human beings equally deserve, as no human being can claim to be ""less evil"" or ""better"" than another human being, since all are equally in need of the divine grace and forgiveness offered in Christ.<br/><br/>As I said, this film has its moving moments, but if filmmakers are attempting to go for pretty obvious Christ-symbolism, they would do well to check their story for consistency with the original."

","This is the worst film i've seen all year, in fact I thought it was aimed at children.  How anyone can call this a piece of uplifting cinema is beyond me.  Okay, Tom Hanks gives a pretty good performance for a one-dimensional do-gooder, but the rest of the film is pantomime of the cheesiest kind, Puss-in-Boots at my local theatre was less predictable. The characters are cliched stereotypes bar none.  We have good kindly guy, comedy good guy, insane bad guy, nice but dim black guy (particularly offensive for this millennium) which leads us to a tedious sermon on good v evil of the most simplistic sort .  The director is clearly living off his reputation, having directed the excellent 'SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION' and poor old Stephen King must be turning in his bed (hopefully he's recovered now). The best thing about the film is Mr Jangles the comedy reincarnating mouse who makes a glorious reappearance in the final reel with slightly longer fur.  The death of Mr Jangles earlier on in the proceedings probably arouses more sympathy from sentimental American audiences than the sight of nasty prisoners frying in 'Old Sparky'.  Please go and watch 'Midnight Express' instead for a slightly more realistic representation of prison life. Risible."

First of all, I really didn't like how this movie dealt with the topic capital punishment. I hardly doubt the atmosphere in a death tract depicted in ""The Green Mile"" is anything like that in real life. Guards and inmates are buddies? (Except for the one BAD guard and the one BAD inmate, of course!) They're cracking jokes and having fun with a little mouse? Oh please! I had a feeling this movie was bad when it started in that nursing home with that sentimental looking old guy but when John started to cough up that what-ever-it-was-horrible-computer-animation-stuff I knew it was just terrible. The movie is overly sentimental, has a horrible constructed plot (sure, the real killer just happens to be in the cell across to Johns) and lacks any creativity and imagination. I read somewhere that Michael Duncan did a great job in this movie.

","It's not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. ""The Green Mile"" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. ""The Green Mile"" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe. ""The Green Mile"" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from ""American Beauty"" in the best performance of 1999."

I'm not a 5-year-old kid and I can't watch The Green Mile without being sarcastic. How can any spectator accept the way this tall black guy is playing? And what did Frank Darabont expect spectators to react watching his so unfair and unhappy fate? Did he want us to burst into tears? Come on! The Shawshank Redemption was shot a few years ago by the same director. It was a prison movie like this one but it was a good one for it avoided too many melodramatic effects and because the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were above all human characters. Those played by Tom Hanks and every other cast member aren't humans. They are nothing but all-American icons and I hate that. Besides the death penalty issue is the heart of the film. Does Darabont seriously tackle it? Never! In The Green Mile, being legally executed appears to be something which has to be taken for granted by every citizen, no matter if people die in some awful way (i.e. Eugène Delacroix, the guy with the lovely mouse), and no matter if an innocent guy sometimes gets toasted. At the end of the film, old Hedgecomb confesses that he couldn't stand executions anymore after Coffey died. So what did he decide to do? Did he organize public protests and demonstrations against this punishment? No! He just left the penitentiary and found another job. What a hero! What an activist!

Coming from the mind of Stephen King (whose most endearing films were outside of the horror genre; namely, The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption and Stand By Me), The Green Mile is a story with many layers depending on how you look at it. Many have likened the story of John Coffey to that of Jesus Christ and, having seen the film, the connection is definitely there to be made with very valid points.

","This is a good film, primarily because of Tom Hanks' subtle ability to portray a man who is tough, hard, and duty conscious, and at the same time compassionate and human. This character reminded me of Hanks' portrayal of Capt. Miller in Saving Private Ryan. A few scenes are grisly, but the tone of the film is generally positive, and several scenes are surprisingly moving. The supernatural powers of one character stood out strangely in a film that otherwise seemed to be dedicated to harsh reality, but I suspect that was intentional, for contrast, and it worked.<br/><br/>One detraction was that I had a nagging suspicion that Hollywood was once again taking an opportunity to promote it's sociopolitical views, on capital punishment, race, and regionalism, but maybe I have become over-sensitive to this issue. At least they did not bash Richard Nixon, but then, it was set in the 1930's.<br/><br/>Compared to American Beauty, this was a better film. I gave it a 9 out of 10."
"FlickJunkie-2","9","1","1","15 June 2000"," Well crafted character study
","Stephen King knows how to spin a yarn.  This is another terrific adaptation of a King novel that delivers a bittersweet story of a depression era Louisiana prison on the death row cell block.  It presents numerous interesting character studies that induce strong emotions for the various characters.  There is also a lot of irony here with good guys who are evil and bad guys who are good.<br/><br/>Director Frank Darabont, who missed out on an Oscar with Shawshank Redemption' (also by Stephen King) to Forrest Gump' must have decided he wasn't going to beaten by Tom Hanks again and secured him for this film with wonderful results.  Unfortunately, he was trumped at the Academy by Kevin Spacey and American Beauty', an injustice in my opinion.<br/><br/>Darabont again does a superlative job of creating the right mix of drama, imagery and human interest.   My only criticism of his direction is that the film was much too long.  It certainly could have been done in two hours instead of three with very little lost in the editing.  We could have eliminated the entire first execution and rehearsal without any loss to the story except perhaps the sponge issue.<br/><br/>The acting was outstanding by all.  Tom Hanks turns in another great performance as the tough but kind cell block boss.  Hanks continues to show his versatility, excelling in both dramatic and comedic roles and moving effortlessly between them like a chameleon.  David Morse mirrored Hanks as another tough guy with a heart and played the part nicely.  Michael Clarke Duncan engendered a very sensitive and lovable nature to his character, making the contrast between his demeanor and physiognomy all the more striking.  And I cannot leave out the uncredited star of the show, the little mouse who played Jangles.<br/><br/>Overall, a well crafted film and an excellent story that suffered slightly from excessive length.  I rated it a 9/10.  I would recommend it highly to anyone except those who are squeamish about graphic violence (such as the electrocution scenes)."

","Our Warner Cinema is 45 minutes away and I spent the whole time on the way back trying to fault this film, and I couldn't think of anything.<br/><br/>
I read the book when it came out and that too was excellent, prior to seeing the film I couldn't think of how they could do some of the stuff in the book without it being cheesy, so I assumed they would change a lot of it, but they didn't and it is one of the best adaptions of a book I have yet seen, along with The Shawshank Redemption."
"davideo-2","Null","1","1","1 May 2000"," Fairly well endowed to the book
","Before going to see The Green Mile tonight, it was only very recently that I had read the novel, and so I was able to know who the names of the characters were fairly quickly, and a lot of the story,for the extreme running time it occupied, became pretty easy to follow.<br/><br/>But, if truth be told, I could have read the book 4 years ago when it was originally published, and still today be able to draw the same comparisons.The fact is, that if you read any novel which the film you are about to see is based on, you can make up your own interpretation of the story, and that is way better, because it happens at your own pace, and it unravels in your own way. So, out of the two, although the film was good, I would probably advise to read the book instead.<br/><br/>The film picked a wise number when it chose to add light, humorous intervals to the story,e.g. Mr.Jingles first introduction, and all the other comic moments it inspired. A movie focusing on a story this grim and unrelenting would need moments like this to make it bearable, because when it is, it chills the blood with it's nastiness. John Coffey's wailing with the two dea d girls, and Eduard Delacroix's execution are profoundly nasty moments in the film. Another of the film's merits is the performances of it's stars. Tom Hanks seems to subconsciously mesmerise with his portrayal of the lead character. His bit as the regular honcho guy who has to place firm law and order on the inmates and his henchmen is affected by the smallest of things. His eye movement, his expressions, and his observations of the time and the place and indeed, the situation he is in truly lift the character he is playing up many notches. As for Michael Clarke Duncan as Coffey, well, in the next role I see him in, I'll be wishing he was in this one again. With one shot, he transforms a regular joe movie personality into a magnificent powerhouse of a performance, that powerfully renders all the cliches/stereotypes obsolete.<br/><br/>Another asset of reading the book, however, is also that if you absorb it, if you take in everything that is happening, ,it will make the film go by far quicker. Although the novel is a far greater suggestion, really, The Green Mile is what proper moviemaking is all about.****"
"DanielHong.org","Null","1","1","12 March 2000"," Tom Hanks distinctive facial and voice expression fits very well in movie
","Capital punishment still remains as controversial issues although still some innocent people go to death row and bad people walkout fine. And someone who is watching the ball s**t as a witness can't do anything about it but comfort the prisoners until the final day. But watching actual electric chair execution is whole different story. Disregards of intensity of crimes he did, no guards can watch him being fried from the chair. That's why many guards are nice to prisoners in death row because sooner than later the prisoners will face worst treatment ever. In this movie, I can see guards and prisoners bond with friendship behinds the strict rules. Well, there are ass-guards in this movie and so there are full of revenges here and there in this movie.<br/><br/>One last thought, Tom Hanks distinctive facial and voice expression fits very well in movies such as ""Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, Turner & Hooch"" where he plays with black characters as partners. It is fact that there are plenty of racial conflicts going around and perhaps this movies (where he is in) can lighten up people."

Don't walk into this movie expecting to see a regular prison movie. That's The Shawshank Redemption. This is a spiritual fable that has 3 different stories in it..they are the following:<br/><br/>1.) An innocent 7ft. tall black man on death row with magical healing powers. 2.) 4 kind prison guards and 1 sadistic one. 3.) 2 other unique prisoners: a man who grows to love and care for a wild mouse and a crazy, violent man named Billy The Kid.<br/><br/>You wonder at first why are there so many different stories but it all fits together at the end. It has a happy ending to it. So happy that I cried tears of joy. While Shawshank was great from beginning to end, Green Mile starts to get good after the first half hour. Good movie, worth a watch, but still not as good as Shawshank. Not by a long shot."
"dtaz","Null","1","1","30 December 1999"," Another moving film from Darabont and King
","The Green Mile caught me by surprise.  Being that The Shawshank Redemption is one of my all-time favorite films, I went into this film expecting an attempt to capitalize on ""Shawshank"".  Man, was I wrong.  Aside from the prison settings, these two films could never be confused with one another. While Shawshank is about the triumph of the human spirit, The Green Mile is more about who we are at our core.  Are we good or evil?  Can we change who we are?  Why are bad things allowed to happen?  There are some imbedded references to Christ, even symbolized in John Coffey, where we see the sacrifice of His dying for our sins.  The cynics out there may choose to smirk at these actions, but I think that they would be making a knee-jerk mistake.  This film makes no judgements about us as a society or any such nonsense, but rather tries to make us look at ourselves, individually, and how we relate to the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Hanks does his best work in a few years.  Michael Duncan and David Morse, I think, are the most compelling, however.  I've heard criticism that the film is ""too long,""  I don't really know how to repond to that argument other than to ask the person if they came to that conclusion before having seen the film.  If a film grabs and interests you, then holds that attention, then there is no way one should be able to make that claim about The Green Mile.  It is the length it should be and needed to be.  I enjoyed it immensely and will put in in my top ten for the year.<br/><br/>One last note to the cynics among us:  cynicism does not automatically make one smart or thoughtful.  In fact, it can be a good thing.  I only say that to remind you that just because a film, book, song, or event is about something ""good"" does not automatically make it bad or untrue."
"Joe Moretti","Null","1","1","29 December 1999"," Another Superb Cast in the Powerful and Magical Green Mile
","The film business is certainly going out of the 20th century with one hell of a bang.  1999 has had an astonishing amount of excellent films with some of the most powerful acting that I can think of.  Just trying to keep up with the slew of great films is a full time job and here at the tail end of the year comes another superb, if slightly flawed piece of filmmaking, ""The Green Mile"".  Like 1994's, ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Green Mile"" is adapted from a Stephen King novella and directed by Frank Darabont, who also directed ""Shawshank"".  The Green Mile of the film is the section of the Louisiana State Penitentiary for death row inmates. Tom Hanks is Paul Edgecomb, the head guard of death row, who is battling a nasty urinary track infection, a sadistic guard (Doug Hutchinson) and the crew of inmates, particularly the nasty William ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Sam Rockwell).  Enter into Edgecombs life, but a new prisoner, John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) who has been convicted of brutally raping and killing two young girls.  A seven-foot gentle giant, Paul is convinced that Coffey is not capable of harming a soul, especially after witnessing his unique healing powers that can't be explained.  The more Paul gets to know him, the harder it is for him to walk Coffey down that green mile.<br/><br/>""The Green Mile"" is somewhat sentimental and predictable, a tad bit too long, starts off at a snails pace, plus the one prison guard is a typical stock villain and the mouse bit (a very cute one to boot) goes on a little too long, but this film is good old fashion story telling with some great acting to help it rise above its minor flaws. It is a powerful and mystical tale that shows the best and worse in humanity.  Much superior to ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Green Mile"" is one of this years best films that relies on great writing with potent acting. The acting is pretty much flawless and Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan are being mentioned for Oscar time.  Both are very good, especially Hanks, who gives another great performance as Paul, but it is Michael Jetter who deserves the Oscar nomination for supporting actor as inmate Eduard Delacroix.  Jetter, a veteran actor of film, stage and television (Evening Shade), gives a brilliant performance creating a very memorable character.  It was not till part way through the movie that I realized that the actor was Michael Jetter.  It will be a major disappointment if he is not nominated; it is a remarkable performance in a film with some of this year's finest acting. David Morse (St. Elsewhere) as prison guard Brutus also does superb work. This fine actor should be working much more; he is totally captivating while on screen.  Overall this is some of the finest ensemble acting this year.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks has good instincts for picking great roles in very good films and ""The Green Mile"" shows him at the peak of his career.  If only more of today's ""movie stars"" could follow his lead.  ""The Green  Mile"", another great film to end 1999 and this century. Recommended.  × × × × out of 5."

","What can I say?  Frank Darabont is a cinematic genius.  Every shot was well thought out, perfectly timed, and beautiful to watch.  As the story starts to unfold, we learn what each character is about, and we see them grow along with the story.  I don't think I stopped crying for the last 20-30 minutes of the film due to the amazing performances of everyone in the cast. Michael Duncan Clarke was superb and Tom Hanks delivers another great performance.  I admit I never read the novel,'The Green Mile' and have never really liked many ""Stephen King"" based movies.  I loved this one as much as 'The Shawshank Redemption'.  When I left the theatre at the end of the 3 hour film, all it's images, characters, and ideals went with me.  I really feel that Frank Darabont finally deserves his Oscar for both best director and best film."

","As I reflect on the film, I keep coming back to one basic thought. It is the thought that struck me about 20 minutes in: This is a film that has been perfectly cast.<br/><br/>It has been four days since I last saw Darabont and Tattersall's The Green Mile and it still hasn't quite all sunk in. I had read Stephen King's serials while recovering from back surgery. The week before surgery, my girlfriend told me that the people who made Shawshank Redemption were adapting another King story and that it would star Tom Hanks and that big guy from Armageddon. So, finding myself confined to my bed, I started reading. I was finished within a day.<br/><br/>I like delude myself a little. I like to think I know a few things about film and I could be a director, you know? When I read good stories, I like to picture which actors would be good for which parts. It was the casting of James Cromwell as The Warden that iced the cake for me. That was one I didn't expect. I thought he would be playing Irish Police Chiefs until he keeled over. Not that playing a southern Prison Warden is casting against type exactly, but he still puts in a nice performance. As does everyone in the film. This must have been a fun film to make.<br/><br/>The only thing that I didn't like about the film was that it explained too much to the audience. So much can be said with just shot sequence and gesture. Sometimes dialogue gets in the way of things that can't be communicated with speech.<br/><br/>Still, I cried like Nancy Karrigan."

Actually, it could even stand to be a bit longer and go into more detail about the condemned inmates themselves and Paul Edgecombe's investigation into Coffey's defense (or lack thereof).<br/><br/>Brilliant performances by Hanks and Duncan.  I was especially wowed by Sam Rockwell's intensity as ""Wild Bill"".

If you've not experienced the novel, be prepared for a story that you will not forget.  Through Frank Darabont's leisurely pace, we become a part of Tom Hanks' world.  We get to see his routines with the inmates, and with his men.  The day that John Coffey arrives on the mile, Hanks' character will never be the same. Some may complain about the running time, but as I stated earlier, the leisurely pace allows you to soak up every minute, every detail and every emotion that you will be exposed to.  The acting is top notch, and spread out over a very good ensemble cast.  Michael Clarke Duncan is wonderful as John Coffey. David Morse is perfectly cast as Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell and Tom Hanks is wonderful as always. Doug Hutchinson brings such venom and spite to the role of Percy Whetmore, you will be satisfied with his fate.   The Green Mile is a film that pulls you in and doesn't let you go.  The ending is an emotional whallop that will unsettle you, but at the same time, you'll realize that it's the only way the story could end.  Another great story from Stephen King, who is making a name for himself as not only the most prolific horror novelist, but as a writer of intimate stories about ordinary events, that become the most extraordinary tales of friendship."
"Dr. Don-2","1","32","114","24 December 1999"," It's not a great film just because they made you cry.
","Nice packaging, but too much of it. Typical Stephen King story, well-told but not much weight.  Full of stereotypes and predictable good guy/bad guy stuff.  I loved Tom Hanks in ""Philadelphia"" -- that was a challenging role and he performed it magnificently, with depth of character, pathos but no sentimentality.  Ever since, though, he's taken on one interchangeable role after another. Enough, already. The sad thing is that I truly CAN believe that almost 50% of the IMDB voters so far rate this very average and over-long film as a ""10"".  Excellence apparently is a function of the volume of tears they make you shed.  I say, ""make you"", because I think this film fully intends to manipulate emotions -- the emotions of white, comfortable, middle class Americans who enjoy cheering for the oppressed, simple but pure of heart big black man who is abused by Southern crackers.  Aren't we glad we're not like that? Yet again, a black man gets to be a parody, not a person.  We white folks don't have to be afraid just because he's big and black, see, 'cause he's really a Jesus figure (""J. C."", his initials).  What a relief. Still wouldn't want him living next door, though, would we? All in all, good actors playing two dimensional roles. In the real world, as Kosovo and Northern Ireland and Rwanda show, we're all just a hair-trigger away from being cruel.  Let's have more films that recognize that there are few good guys and bad guys, just a whole lot of us doing the best we can and trying to do it right.  That's too complicated for most Hollywood types, and doesn't usually make much money. ""Dead Man Walking"" was ten times the film that this one was, and even it wasn't a ""10"".<br/><br/>""Besieged"" and ""The Informer"" were so much better than ""The Green Mile"" that to mention Oscars without naming those films is ridiculous.<br/><br/>And that's all this middle-aged long-time and ardent lover of films has to say."

","I believe I am alone in my dislike of this movie.  In fairness, the acting and cinematography are excellent.  That said, the story and directing of the characters was extremely problematic for me.<br/><br/>Here we have this man who has an incredible gift to heal others and the audience looks on in amazement as he performs miracles but at no time do the characters on screen seem freaked out, excited, or exhibit any emotion other than ""Hey lookey what he can do.  Let's get him to cure my wife.""  That ruins the whole picture for me because it was no longer believable.  If I witnessed such visually stunning miracles(stuff coming from the mouth etc.) I would be telling everyone I knew, calling scientists, papers, etc.<br/><br/>The other characters also didn't seem too hurt that they were going to execute an innocent man.  Unbelievable!  Especially an innocent man with extraordinary powers.  In the real world many fight to keep real killers on death row alive and spare their lives but nobody fights for this man. Hogwash!"

","If you go to see ""The Green Mile,"" be prepared to laugh. A lot. And not because the film's intention is for the audience to laugh--it's just that bad. It has all the outward appearances of a very moving, emotionally charged film that will make you leave the theater saying ""Wow."" (The subject concerns Death Row inmates, Tom Hanks stars, and the director is of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" fame). But I just left the theater laughing, because the movie had become so predictable in its plot and dialogue that the woman behind me had begun to recite the lines along with the characters. (And the sad thing about THAT is that I saw it on opening night).<br/><br/>But its predictability is not even remotely one of ""The Green Mile""'s major problems, and those are an overly corny, hokey story and script that are nearly impossible to buy (especially those particles that fly out of John Cofee's mouth whenever he performs a miracle--what is THAT?), acting ranging from mediocre to downright bad (no wonder John Cofee was given so few lines), and a complete inconsistency in tone. A movie about Death Row inmates should NOT cut from a scene of a man being executed (of which this movie shows about three) to a scene of the guards cooing over a cute little mouse (which appeared in the movie so much that the damn thing should've been named after the mouse). The execution scenes are of such a brutal nature that directly juxtaposing them with light-hearted prison follies completely degrades the seriousness of execution and is outright jolting for the audience.<br/><br/>""The Green Mile"" left a bad taste in my mouth from its opening moments which never really left. Once I began to get a feel for how limited it was in hitting the real issue of the film, however, I was able to view it as one of those happy ""drama-turned-comedy"" accidents. I can only say that any recognition for ""The Green Mile"" for any more than it actually is--a piece of cheese that never deserved to see cinematic daylight--is  a not-so-happy accident indeed."

","Frank Darabont's follow up to the Shawshank Redemption is a poorly written and painfully unoriginal story. <br/><br/>For starters, the Noble Savage stereotype is racist at best. A character that is misunderstood by society and doesn't want to live in that society due to the character's extreme moral idealism (i.e. edward scissorhands, powder, etc.) is far from new. <br/><br/>Coffey's character is not the only one that is one dimensional. Pretty much all the characters' dispositions are made to be one of two things: good or bad. There are no gray lines and it is obvious who the audience is supposed to hate and who they are supposed to root for. It's boring and childish. The frenchman, Michael Jeter, is made up so that we feel completely sorry for him. We're not even allowed to know what his crime was because then we might not love him so much.<br/><br/>The prison guards are the most loving forgiving group of prison guards that have ever lived. Hell, they're the most loving forgiving people that ever lived. A prisoner spits in Tom Hanks's face and he actually does nothing about it? My grandmother isn't that nice.<br/><br/>Stop reading here if you have not seen the movie.<br/><br/>And wasn't it convenient that that prisoner, Sam Rockwell, just happened to be the actual criminal behind Coffey's crime? And when they ""caught"" Coffey with the girls, can anyone honestly say that if a black man was found with two dead white girls that they would not shoot him? Black men in the 30's, and especially in the South, would be killed for being seen in public with a white woman, much less killing a white child.<br/><br/>And when Coffey does die, Tom Hanks doesn't put too much effort into stopping the execution. He just asks Coffey what he should do, and Coffey says nothing, so that's what he does. Of course Coffey must die, because in all racist Noble Savage films the savage must die so that his white savior can learn a valuable lesson.<br/><br/>And where is the warden at this point? He said he can't stop the execution, but I find that implausible. I'm sure he could at least try to save the man who saved his wife. And wasn't that a plot twist that was hard to see coming? I also found it interesting that when Coffey healed her, he also did her hair and put makeup on her. <br/><br/>The whole movie has no real continuity being that it was adopted from a serial novel. The movie could have ended in about five different places and the audience wouldn't have minded. <br/><br/>The only interesting element of this movie is its ending which certainly does not save it. I suppose this movie is more Stephen King's fault than Darabont's, but regardless the movie is a disappointment in front the backdrop of all the superb movies that have been released with it in the past few months."

","Made with little subtlety, grace, or wit, suffers from the same disease as Shawshank in seeking profundity in every vignette. Whereas I could overlook some of the preposterous and contrived situations in Shawshank and just enjoy the movie, the Green Mile just seemed contrived except for a few scenes and characters. Of course it has redeeming qualities about it, namely Duncan's performance and the gripping execution scenes.<br/><br/>
I like Shawshank alot despite its flaws, however The Green Mile is just plain mediocre, not one I would ever want to sit through again. It could have been a decent 90 minute movie. The far too long and frequent mouse vignettes detracted and cost the movie momentum, there is no need to show a guy pee 10 times in the movie, we understand that it hurts when he pees, enough already!. The evil prison guard was just far too simple and one-dimensional a character to the point of absurdity which eliminates the impact of his comeupance at the end, contrast this with the very satisfying end to Shawshank's prison warden (a far more interesting, faceted, and believable character). The end was diluted as well, I think the movie went a scene too far at the end into some fuzzy preaching, as a viewer it really wasn't necessary, the impact of Duncan's end on the Hanks character and the viewer is strong and moving and the movie should have ended there instead of having a scene to explain to the audience (as if to a slow fifth-grader) the truth of the moment."

For this film to be rated so highly, is completely bewildering to me. Let me just say that I am by no means some kind of American working class slob who can only sit through a 90 minute action-packed popcorn film loaded special fx and t&a. I can easily sit through films like Barry Lyndon and 2001 without even getting up for a snack. If a film is truly great, it will hold my attention. If it isn't, then I may just doze off. At least I was interested enough to rewind it when I woke up to see what I missed. It wasn't worth the effort. <br/><br/>This film failed on almost every level to connect or convey any true emotion to me. The only character I liked was Michael Clarke Duncan as a Christ-like figure who has exceptional healing powers, but is put to death for a crime he didn't commit. The film is slow, talky, and not very well-acted. This was truly surprising since the cast members of this film are usually quite good.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks stars as a guard in charge of the death row wing of on old southern prison. Through most of the film, we see him and the other guards interacting with the prisoners and carrying out an execution here and there. Tom Hanks gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen him give. The only emotion he shows at all is agony while trying to pass a stone through his urethra! Yes, a major plot point in this film is that Hanks is having trouble urinating! Whatever.<br/><br/>As far as the other characters go, nobody does that well in the acting department. David Morse, Barry Pepper, and James Cromwell have boring characters. The individuals who play the bad guard and the psychotic prisoner over-act badly. Michael Jeter's character is so annoying that I couldn't wait to see him executed. His execution scene is perhaps the most memorable scene in the film. <br/><br/>And the part with the little mouse! Way too cutesy for words. I thought I was watching Stuart Little for a moment. <br/><br/>And not to spoil the conclusion or anything, but there is absolutely no payoff for anything we've learned throughout the film. I at least was hoping the ending would tie everything up in a thoughtful manner that would somehow make the whole experience rewarding. Nope! <br/><br/>Overall, this film is a dud.

Unpleasant subject matter (and several vile supporting characters) don't detract from the emotional value of the piece, which is professionally handled despite one or two small missteps (an execution scene, for instance, which runs too long).

","The Green Mile is a movie of emotions, a movie that leaves a life lasting experience and above all a movie that keeps you involved in till the very end. Director Frank Darabont does take his job seriously. The events in the movie take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at ""the mile"" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.<br/><br/>The action done by each and every person is fantastic, specially John Coffey (Michael Duncan) who plays a little less prominent role in super hit movie Armageddon. This movie is all what a classic should have. It's not a special effects action or adventure. It a movie for people who really appreciate the basic elements of a feature file and that is story, acting and flow.<br/><br/>My recommendation is don't ever miss it and keep a hanky with youjust in case??"

","The film version of Stephen King's novel, a retelling of the story of Christ's Crucifixion, is possibly one of the most beautifully bittersweet and deeply emotionally satisfying pieces of film making I've ever seen. The Green Mile works on so many levels, a mystical story of God's love and forgiveness, a loving story of friends working together toward a common good, and a brutality-tinged mystery of who killed two little girls in Depression-era Louisiana. I cannot find a really significant flaw in King's writing, the ensemble cast's performances, or Frank Darabont's direction.<br/><br/>This is a gem and a blessing!"

My Dad suggested watching it and I agreed because I admire Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>But what I saw blew me away. I've never seen a film that was so amazing. In general I'm not a very sensitive person who cries often, but since I watched it for the first time I've been crying anytime when I saw it.<br/><br/>After the I had seen the movie I read the book and it was the first time that a movie was as good as the original story. It's also very hard to to as well as Stephen King and to produce emotions and fear like he does. But this very movie succeeded in doing both.<br/><br/>It's also because of its great story and its amazing characters. The whole movie is not just about one single person as you might think. You get to know about the story and the situation and the destiny of every single character.<br/><br/>It was the first movie that made me cry. When you watch it you just don't simply ""watch"" it. You become part of it. You can feel the anger and the hatred that is felt by the wardens against this damn Percy and you can fell the pain John Coffey has. It touches you so much when Coffey says that he never had a friend to tell him where they should go. You wish to be his friend. You wish you tell him that he's the most fantastic person you've ever met in your entire life.<br/><br/>The end drives the emotions to the peak. John Coffey: Sorry for what I am. What do you say, John? You are one of the true miracles! Don't apologise for yourself. And when Hanks comes towards Duncan and touches his hand and Duncan thinking ""He killed them with their love for each other"" you're gone.<br/><br/>You can't understand why such an amazing person wants do die and doesn't like himself.<br/><br/>I can't understand when people complain about this movie.

","'The Green Mile'<br/><br/>I have found many prison movies overrated. 'The Shawshank Redemption' was good, perhaps great, but not the best movie ever (according to the average IMDb.com user, the film is number two on the list of the best movies ever). It was actually quite a rip-off of 'Escape From Alcatraz,' but that's a different story. What I'm saying is that prison movies tend to be overrated. But 'The Green Mile' with Tom Hanks was a very nice surprise.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays a prison guard in the depression-era. He isn't just any prison guard, however. He is a guard on 'The Green Mile,' which houses criminals on death row. He is under the employment of James Cromwell, and is husband to Bonnie Hunt.<br/><br/>And then, one day, a huge giant named John Kofe  'like the drink, only spelled different' -comes into the prison, and miracles start to happen. I won't tell you what happens regarding any of the miracles and such, but I will tell you to look out for the mouse. <br/><br/>The acting in 'The Green Mile' is excellent. Tom Hanks does a great job in his role, quipping a southern accent and a prison ward cap. Michael Clarke Duncan brings John Kofe to life: a sweet, innocent giant. Irony at its best, considering the man is about eight feet tall.<br/><br/>The movie plays with the audience's emotions. At times you want to laugh; at times you want to cry; at times you want to cheer. But at all times you can't help but participate in the film. <br/><br/>The film is long at times - clocking in at over a whopping three hours - but I don't have a problem with that. I'm not in any rush. I came to watch a movie, and that's what I'm going to do. I'm not one of those people that complain about the length of time a film has. If I don't feel like watching a movie, then why did I even go see a movie in the first place?<br/><br/>'The Green Mile' was adapted to the screen by Frank Darabont, who brought us 'The Shawshank Redemption.' Between the two, I'm not sure which I like better. They are both very good movies.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend it. It is easily one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>4.5/5 stars "

"Marmaduke Grove","Null","3","6","22 August 2002"," ""The Green Mile is so long"" - You ain't kidding!
","The Green Mile, as you already must know if you're here, is a story about Black Jesus (hey! I thought that was Everlast! =D), aka John Coffey (JC - get the hint? Well, the rest of the movie is even less subtle) played by Michael Clarke Duncan and everyman-type White Pontius Pilate (Paul Edgecomb here - surprising it's not Paul Pedgecomb) Tom Hanks - whose distinguishing feature, unfortunately for all of us is a often-showcased urinary infection (couldn't they make it like a sore shoulder or something?). As for the story, you pretty much already guessed it - you've heard of the Bible, right?<br/><br/>Okay, you know that already, we established. You probably also know that Tom Hanks is a great actor. David Morse also is in a creepy way. Michael Clarke Duncan isn't, unfortunately. But Hey, I guess if the script calls for a giant, your choices are pretty limited?<br/><br/>But all in all, the cast is good, and the interplay between them is also very good. That is not the problem.<br/><br/>Well, then, you may ask, what is? Is there even one? Sorry to disappoint everyone, but, yes, there is - or are - two, in fact.<br/><br/>One: I didn't think it was at all possible but this movie manages to me more over-dramatic self-important and pompous than Frank Darabont's previous effort - that way-overrated #2 movie in the world for-some-bizarre-inexplicable-reason Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>Two: The Length. 3 hours plus. To me, that's just unnecessary. I mean yes, if a movie is good you don't really care how long it is, but when it's borderline like this movie is, that just goes to annoy you, the viewer.<br/><br/>A side note - this movie scores the third greatest last line in movie history with the (I hope intentionally) bittersweetly too-true ""Sometimes the green mile can be so long.""  Good point, Tom, but actually, it always is - no matter how you watch it it still takes 188 minutes every time.<br/><br/>Overall, I'll give it a 5 out of the 10"

Tom Hanks has a great money making face but his acting is pretty bland and sub-standard in most movies. The writing, however, is just stupid as most King ventures. Grown men get scared and pee their pants and the ironies that he is able to present are so obvious they are like being hit in the face with a building (very BIG black man is a sweet and harmless innocent).

Nothing new beneath the sun, only poorly executed re-runs of ideals belonging in the 19th century. When it finally reaches the not very surprising end, we are supposed to be crying our guts out.

And this was reaffirmed by the fact that the director also directed Shawshank Redemption. What I got was a Stephen King-esq novel movie overflowing with lame symbolism and un-explained superpowers. In fact I know the exact point the movie turned for the worse. The first time John Coffey used his ""magic healing"" powers, I realized how lame this movie could be. Although I should have realized the clishe trip i was going to take when the movie opened with a flashback. This movie included most every dramatic clishe it could, including: old guy flashback, good natured guy (tom hanks) in a horrible place (the prison), and finally a christ story. But then what did you expect from Stephen King, an original story?

","I use that expression cautiously and deliberately. This film hides its massive illogic and implausibility behind emotional manipulativeness and cheap tear-jerker tricks. Fans of the film who may be reading this will naturally object as though I am invalidating their tears. But please consider that your tears were coaxed out by a crude setup. Some complaints: 1. Where on earth would one find such compassionate prison guards? To quote Mahathir Muhammad, ""Either one gets callouses on one's heart or you bleed to death."" 2. In the South of 1935, not even the white liberals would treat a black man with such dignity, let alone prison guards. 3. How would a patrician white woman thank an illiterate and dirty black man for saving her life? With a hug? 4. Once John Coffey sees Wild Bill, why would his only words be,""He's a bad man!""? Why did he say nothing? 5. After visiting Coffey's lawyer, why did Paul say nothing to any legal authority? 6. The execution of Delacroix was annoyingly unrealistic. A botched execution (and there have been many) would never be anywhere nearly as gruesome. 7. Finally, and this is the point at which I hated the movie, there were MANY opportunities for the guards to get Coffey's case re-opened, even if he didn't cooperate. But that would have turned it into a courtroom drama, not a religious-like story of redemption, suffering and eternal punishment."
"snsh","2","9","28","31 August 2003"," 1.5 hour movie stretched to 3 hours
","I don't understand why this movie is so highly rated.  I suspect it's partly a christian-thing given the theme and all.  Not being raised christian it doesn't connect with me.  But regardless, the movie has several problems:<br/><br/>First, every scene is twice as long as it needs to be.  Also include many formulaic scenes when I the moviegoer was supposed to go ""ooh ahh"" in wonderment, but instead I was so bored.  This film could have been 1.5 hours long with no loss of content.  Tom Hank's closing line is even something like ""the green mile can seem awfully long.""  Oh the irony.<br/><br/>Second, the writers give the characters a handicap of being incapable of communicating -- JC rambles about ""helping people"" when he could simply say ""hey look I have special powers allow me to demonstrate.""  If I were in charge of sentencing, I could see myself putting him on death row too -- it is so frustrating.  The same frustration comes from the buildup to the scene with the warden's wife -- if Tom Hanks only lucidly told the warden what's up, they could've done the job in 5 minutes without any fuss.  Instead, they were cryptic and turned it into a 45 minute production.  What a waste of time.<br/><br/>Third, the philosophy of the movie just doesn't seem right.  The prison guards all have super-cushy jobs.  Compare to the characters in Saving Private Ryan.  Which extreme commands more respect?  I don't see building heroes out of prison guards.  Similarly, the main character JC is wallows in self-pity.  Rather than be so depressed about the evil in the world, he needs to swallow it and go out and do something with his life.  Take valium if you have to.  If you're in trouble with the US government, flee to Yemen.<br/><br/>These problems were on my mind every minute of the film.  Most likely you won't be bothered by them, given the ratings.  But to be safe, in case you watch The Green Mile and after 1/2 an hour you don't like it, turn it off you won't like the next 2 1/2 hours either."

","This movie was offensive to me. I felt (and I am sure people will be happy to disagree with me) that the black character in this film was trivialized and ultimately only served to further the white characters lives.<br/><br/>Just to illustrate, the character is not intelligent. He is overtly meant to symbolize Jesus Christ, but he is not smart. The white characters, with very few exceptions are not racist (in the South, in the 1930's!? and before you say anything, I live in CO now, but grew up in Mississippi). So you have this group of death row guards, who care about the prisoners, except one mean guard. You have this eight-foot-tall black man who is dumb and scared. However he can raise the dead. I realize this is supposed to be magical realism, but switch this to Germany in the 40's, make the black guy jewish, and the guards nazis, and nobody would buy it. Death row guards in the South were as racist then as they are today. Working on Death Row does not make you sympathetic to prisoners, it makes you cold and angry.<br/><br/>
***SPOILERS****(although if you haven't seen this, don't. Go rent Dead Man Walking)<br/><br/>Forget the obvious historically inaccurate premise. Let's just look at the fact that this is an uplifting movie when the most sympathetic person is killed, and Tom Hanks lives to be 300. It is obvious that this is yet another movie where black people are meant to be only helpers to the white main characters (Legend of Bagger Vance, Ghost, Song of the South). Even though this character is physically, morally, and supernaturally superior to everyone else, he uses his powers only to help the white guards, not to escape, or survive, but to die that Tom Hanks might live. If that is it, then this movie is a tragedy.<br/><br/>This movie is pure crap. I gave it a 2 for the cinematography. Tom Hanks plays a fatter version of his normal part, likeable white guy (when will this guy play a villain?). Stephen King provides the story (thanks for writing about the South, Stephen. You're from Maine right?). Together they manage to trivialize everything from the Civil Rights struggle to the Bible. Nice work, guys. Hope you enjoy the money."

","It's not all negative; the period feel is strong, if very middle-class (the sharecroppers have a phone???), and so are the ensemble performances. The Green Mile unquestionably does a good job of pressing the right emotional response buttons for entertainment purposes. So does 'Bambi'. My problem with TGM is the amount of disbelief that has to be suspended to enjoy it. In Disney cartoons you know that anything is allowed to be possible, it's an animation. In TGM it's completely obvious - and completely unnecessary - that John Coffey is holding a light bulb in the 'help' moments; it's completely obvious that his breathing out the 'badness' is gratuitous CGI; couldn't they just have left him and the others to ACT it? The overwrought SFX turn Coffey's miracles into cheap sideshow stunts. Don't get me started on the mouse, by which the cardboard characters are upstaged. TOO MUCH MOUSE!<br/><br/>It's a shame that the script characterisations are totally subservient to the sentimental story, like in a pantomime. Cold Mountain Block D managed to recruit the most liberal-minded bunch of warders in the country - but not one of them ever has a twinge of conscience, let alone any sense of smell! The only point where a character seems to get complicated is when the oh-so-nasty nephew turns co-operative for five minutes after striking a bargain with Tom Hanks. He soon reverts to stereotype. The rest of the film they all just follow paths that wouldn't be out of place in a high school nativity play. At no time does any of these sensitive, earnest death row wardens question the morality of capital punishment - from either end, even to get slapped down. Nobody criticises it, nobody justifies it, it's just not an issue, even in the modern, smell-less old folk's home at the beginning. You're left with the conclusion that in spite of all their caring, sharing postures, that those warders are just pretending, and just want to see those guys fry, like waiters longing for the last customer to leave. And so you stop believing their good intentions, and your disbelief is suspended. Same as I felt when I saw that poster covering the hole waving in the draft in 'Shawshank'. The morality of capital punishment is an elephant in the room that TGM and its sensitive, liberal characters ignore - apart from the attorney - he had the right degree of bloodlust.<br/><br/>TGM is effective as broad entertainment, but the reality of the situations (execution, racism) it deals with is so horrible that you almost want to shout ""stop sugar-coating it!"" at the screen. Tom Hanks - his usual dependable, if ever-so-slightly bland performance - experiences ten times more pain from his NSU than from the gruesome job he does, and the ghastly system he is a pillar of. And the reason TGM takes so long between story beats (how many times must we see him screw that thing on his head, already!) is that if it didn't, the paper-thin story would crash and burn in an hour. Don't take it as seriously as it takes itself, it's a well-dramatised piece of mummery."

","""The Green Mile"" tries hard to be a nice movie, to steer your emotions, to feel along. Etc. Everybody who is nice simply is nice, character depth is secondary. What completely ridicules the entire thing is the influence of fantasy elements to enlighten the atmosphere. Not only is everybody nice, but heah, with some special abilities they are even nicer!<br/><br/>
Technically the movie is of course well done. Camera, lights, everything is in the green. Unfortunately that doesn't make a good movie, when characters are simply created to fulfill general expectations. Although this simply seems to be a routine production to appeal to mass audiences, anyway, and of course it hits right on the target. That Hanks was in for a role here is understandable - his main aim nowaday seems to be building up his reputation with the Academy. For Duncan the decision was probably more difficult, he got to play the usual part of the black country guy. But a chance to get a role in a ""made to please the academy"" film is a hard thing to refuse, esp. when your co-star is Hanks and a name like Stephen King stands for the novel.<br/><br/>It is much more reccomendable to watch ""Dead Man Walking"" for a good look on the topic, but of course if you felt along with the characters in Cameron's ""Titanic"" this is your thing to go for."

","Painfully long and drawn-out movie which comes across like an ""after-school special"" for grown-ups. I was irritated by its transparent heavy-handedness and attempts at audience manipulation. The acting is quite good at all levels, but not good enough to make up for a story which carries on for three dreadful hours of ugliness. No redeeming (or entertainment) value here at all. A MUCH better movie set in the same time period is the Coen's ""Brother, Where Art Thou?"""

In the South in the 1930's, a black man is seen holding two dead young white girls.  He is found by a group of gun totting redneck yahoos.

"matzucker","3","6","17","11 September 2000"," Of mice and men... and murderers.
","That it should've been, at least.<br/><br/>But let's start at the beginning, which is, I might add, terribly slow. A lot of time passes before something actually happens. King & Darabont use this time to carefully put their chess pieces in place before making their move in the last 60 minutes or so. There's a host of details during the first 2/3s that later become significant. And since I'm not one of those who need to see fireworks of action and suspense from the first instant of a movie, that's fine with me. After all, the pace increases considerably during the course of the movie.<br/><br/>Some of these aforementioned details are so predictable that I could guess the next turn of events half an hour in advance. And that's never a good thing.<br/><br/>The last hour, however, makes up for a lot of the film's former trappings. There's no arguing that the solution is quite touching.<br/><br/>So finally, a movie worth watching, but there were still a few things that bugged me. First, I would've liked to know more about the inmates as murderers, which I guess they were supposed to be. (You never notice, though.) In the way they're portrayed, these are good, righteous people that are good friends with the wardens, love a cute mouse and are generally lovable. So- why are they in death row anyway? I understand the novel shed some light on this, and the film could've certainly needed some of this other side of the story to avoid some of the schmaltz.<br/><br/>
Second, isn't this prison just lovely? I mean, it seems like a camping tour at some points. If death row is like that, I want to be in it!<br/><br/>If The Green Mile was supposed to make any statement about the right or wrong of the death sentence, you'd better watch Dead Man Walking to form your own opinion instead of being manipulated into believing that all killers ultimately become nice people once they're in Our Favorite Death Row. It works for tearjerking, but not for discussion of that subject.<br/><br/>But, mind you, I couldn't help being manipulated myself- and it worked. I was genuinely moved at the end and, despite the occasional predictability, the story had its clever moments.<br/><br/>So, it was an OK movie, at times even a bit more, but it sure didn't deserve its Best Picture nomination at the Oscars, and it sure can't hold a candle to King's and Darabont's first joint venture, the brilliant The Shawshank Redemption. 7 out of 10."

Then the first of the miracles occurs as John Coffey performs a ""laying on of hands"" cure on Paul Edgecomb. Later he brings a mouse to life with the ""evil"" spewing from his mouth! It is almost comic.<br/><br/>The comedy ""miracles"" get sillier and the film drags on and on until it finally reaches its nadir with the shot of John Coffey in the cinema with the projector light behind him like the aura in a medieval depiction of Christ  oh please - treat me as a grown up. What a waste of a great opportunity. Could it be re-edited with the daftness taken out? It should have been brilliant."

Why?<br/><br/>This film lacks in a million ways and I find a lot of user views quite laughable when there are many other great films available out there, the green mile is a very bad film which barely spreads any emotion at all unless you enjoy watching people on death row and extremely vile and horrible bad guys that are throughly unbelievable. In ending I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone at all. It is way too long and I feel if it was two hours long it would have been watchable and enjoyable. The film has no real story either ( is it about a mouse, an inmate, a prison officer, death row - can you really relate to such a film that has no cohesion). I feel people got carried away by the mouse really - other than that rent out something worth watching instead. Comparing this to the shawshank redemption is ludicrous as well."

But disappointment hit me early, and it was a direct blow that knocked me down and out.<br/><br/>Prisons are fun, aren't they? Well, in this film they sure are. Chasing a mouse and stuff. And, oh yeah, most inmates waiting for the electrical chair are actually kind, nice, sometimes even philosophical people. THEY are the victims. Not the relatives of the people they murdered. Those inmates are in there for murder for crying out loud. But they act as if they can't even put their own pants on. And this Percy character, he is really 'bad'. But he's the most 'real' person in the entire film---a film which is basically as ridiculous as Tom Hanks playing a SERIOUS role. Tom Hanks IS Forrest Gump, or the main character in ""Big"", both essentially being large kids. Picturing Hanks as a warden is as silly as claiming that James Bond is a monogamist.<br/><br/>

I actually arrived a few minutes late to the screening and (thank God) missed the ""Saving Private Ryan"" style old-person-seeking-forgiveness bookend, yet I immediately knew exactly what was coming for the entire rest of the movie.<br/><br/> (CAUTION: SPOILER)  You couldn't watch the demonstration of the execution, with its excruciating emphasis on the wet sponge, to know that bad, bad Percy was going to dry-fry some poor sucker.  And everyone knew the lovely dying belle would be healed in a touching climax.  But beyond the utterly simplistic characters, the by-numbers plot line, and the butt-numbing slowness, there was also a self-serving hypocrisy I found absolutely offensive.  Given that one of the main characters is a huge black man on death row wrongfully convicted of a crime he didn't commit, we are naievely supposed to assume that this is a sensitive, anti-racist film.  Yet how challenging would it have been to make that (single) black character more intelligent than even Mr. Jingles the Circus Mouse?  And the final ""I ain't never seen a picture show"" scene is unforgivably masturbatory.  Given the history of this writer-director team in ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" which managed to skillfully engineer a happy ending and admirable morals without turning into pulp, this film was a major disappointment."

Emotionally it was riveting as you could feel nothing but sympathy and appreciation for all but one character in the film. Even with that, it left me feeling very empty afterwords and was almost as depressing as ""The Pledge"" starring Jack Nicholson. It was overly hyped and not worthy in my own collection although others may feel differently.

It was a great half-hour, and there was a memorable shot of Swayze touching the hands of other inmates on his march to death row in order to ""heal"" them.  That was a half-hour in 1986.  Why does Stephen King take 6 novellas and Frank Darabont over three hours to tell the same story with less impact.

If you happened to like The Green Mile, I can understand...to an extent. In fact, if this film had been an hour and a half long, I would have left throwing Academy Awards at it. If such a film had been accomplished within a humane amount of film, I'd have been impressed. But accomplishing this little dramatically when dealing with such a difficult issue as the death penalty over such an immense amount of time is simply inexcusable.<br/><br/>There are some individual performances that stand out, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan and David Morse's.

I found it too long; turned it off after about two and a half hours (too late at night/early morning). Nicely paced, though; obviously, the story takes three hours to tell, which is fair enough. <br/><br/>I went along with much of the early parts, the death row routines, the bad apple among the little good guys; the likable inmates - bad boys once but harmless old lags now.

When a very large African-American named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives, Paul witnesses some events that no one could ever imagine.<br/><br/>This is the only which comes to my mind that I would classify as both haunting and heartwarming at the same time. Haunting because the prison's bleak environs drain all hope; heartwarming because of what happens in this particular prison. Both Hanks and Duncan turn in pitch-perfect performances, as do the other cast members. Bonnie Hunt as Paul's wife Jan, trying to cope with the effects that her husband's job has on their personal life; James Cromwell as Warden Hal Moores, doing everything to carry out his job but depressed by numerous factors; Doug Hutchison as despicable guard Percy Wetmore, who likes nothing more than to be as cruel as possible; David Morse, Barry Pepper, and Jeffrey DeMunn as fellow guards Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell, Dean Stanton, and Harry Terwilliger, respectively; Sam Rockwell as vicious inmate ""Wild Bill"" Wharton; Michael Jeter and Graham Greene as fellow inmates Eduard Delacroix and Arlen Bitterbuck, respectively; Patricia Clarkson as the warden's wife Melinda, afflicted by an awful disease; Harry Dean Stanton as loopy janitor Toot-Toot; and Dabbs Greer as the elderly Paul Edgecombe.

Well, to the extent that ""The Green Mile"" is Christian allegory, Christ said something like this: `Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.  -Oh wait, I'M without sin!""  THUNK!<br/><br/>Why does everyone assume that this story even takes place in a Christian universe?  Is it because so many of the characters are Christian?  But this is 1930s American South.  What did you expect?  When a character with supernatural powers of healing lumbers up, OF COURSE everyone assumes the powers are God-given; they assume his perfectly ordinary eyebrows are God-given, too; but the script gives us no reason to suppose that they're right.  Rather the reverse.  There's something random and essentially pointless about Coffey's abilities and actions, something that suits an atheist or pagan universe in which all sorts of oddities just turn up, something which doesn't justify the atmosphere of reverential ponderousness adopted by Frank Darabont and his cast.  (What IS that brown dust that Coffey spews out periodically?  Is it now OBLIGATORY for directors to run the rough footage through a computer and make it worse somehow?)  But it's a very modern sort of paganism.  There's nothing at all beautiful about the magic, which is a telling flaw.<br/><br/>Look: it's not as bad as I thought it would be.  I THOUGHT that Darabont would have let the extravagant praise heaped upon ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (a good film, by the way) go to his head, and produce a slow, lingering, pompous version of a less interesting story.  Sort of true, but it has its moments (although, as more than one critic I've read has added, ""perhaps by chance"").  I thought Tom Hanks would be unendurable.  Surprisingly, he does a good job, all things considered.  I thought the racism would get on my nerves.  It's not really racist.  Coffey is a simpleton, but not because of the rule that blacks must be simpletons; rather, the rule is that good people must be simpletons.  (Coffey is so good he can barely form sentences.)

","THE GREEN MILE-starts out with an  older man, remembering the time he was much younger and working in 'the green mile', the prison cell block, prisoners were put in, before being electrocuted in the electric chair. The real story starts when a huge black man, John Coffey comes in, who much later in the film turns out to be able to heal people in a mysterious way. We also get acquainted with the other prisoners and wards. One of the wards is not as nice as the others, but a frustrated sadist. The story is well told with great eye for detail, also the actors, with Tom Hanks as main character are giving excellent performances. The film loses (great part) of its' credibility when John Coffey starts working his miracles. It is not very clear why we need to see not one, not two, but THREE electrocutions(of which one goes wrong and never seems to end).<br/><br/>But what is mainly disturbing about this film is not so much its' length or the unnecessary flashback (why not start right away with the story?), but the portrayal of its charachters. The film seems to be trying to tell us, that we should be nice to all, no matter what or who, not be racist, but it does it in a very stereotypical and disturbing way, and thus sending the opposite message. As Hall already once argued, a representation of, for example violence, is not violence, but a message about violence. The huge, muscled black guy, is really a softy who is hardly able to pronounce grammarly correct sentences. It is very surprising nobody protested against this terrible stereotype, which I supposed has been overcome and  belonged to the past, where blacks were thought simple and stupid. The nice wards are all good christians (after all, we are in the south of America), and therefor it is impossible that someone who is able to perform miracles has done any harm. And indeed this 'angel' turns out to be innocent. Yep, the Good and the Bad are not to be mixed up, ignoring roughly the enormous grey area in between. Surprising  then that it is OK to treat the nasty ward, Percy, in a very cruel manner. OK, he is a very bad guy, but weren't we supposed to be nice to all? * 1/2 out of five"

","Prison drama + fantasy. I didn't see that coming. It brought emotion into the picture. Some would need tissue box because it's wild till the end.
Well done. A story of life, love, loss and loyalty. A moving example of how anyone can change with more acceptance and less judgement. One of the greats."
"joecoby45","6","2","4","15 February 2018"," A pretty decent, if unmemorable film.
","The Green Mile is a fairly decent movie in most regards. Its well filmed with good production values and has a pretty OK story that overall is entertaining to watch. The performances are also all very good. Especially by Michael Clarke Duncan, Sam Rockwell, and Doug Hutchinson.<br/><br/> However by the end of the film I just felt underwhelmed. Nothing really special happened in it. The super natural aspects really weakened the story in my opinion. Going into it I was expecting the story to be about a prison guard who works on death row who just so happens to befriend one of his prisoners. So when the whole thing became supernatural I was a little disappointed. If the story was more grounded in reality and had a lot less filler it would have been emotionally gut wrenching. But its not. <br/><br/>Also there is a very out of place violent scene in this movie. A man gets slowly burnt alive because of a villain sabotaging the electric chair. Its a scene that feels taken directly from a Hostel movie. Ugh."
"rpk_74","3","2","4","2 March 2014"," Entertaining movie but with childish magical elements, failed to touch me
","Let me start off by telling the positive: the movie didn't bore me like some other people said. Some scenes were funny and the acting was decent. Overall the movie was entertaining.<br/><br/>But that being said, I really do not understand this movie being in the IMDb top 50. I found this movie disappointing because of the almost random magical aspect they added. Though this is symbolism or whatever you wanna call it, I didn't buy it. And neither did my friend. When the first ""magical moment"" happened we were like ""hmm okay, that's kinda lame/weird, but okay i guess we'll get it at the end of the movie"". Unfortunately that didn't happen and after the first magical moment, this movie just downgrades to a simple childish story of a person having some kind of superpower and the prison guards being amazed by it. To me it lacks meaning, feels way too random and the magical elements are childish. If I were still a kid though i'd probably be amazed too by the magic, just like the main characters. So maybe the target audience they had in mind were kids.<br/><br/>This movie did entertain me but nothing about it was touching or shocking. I personally couldn't identify with John Coffey, because to me he's not human but some kind of superpower. This movie was supposed to be meaningful and touching, but it failed miserably hard at it for me, would not recommend unless you're kid or you don't mind the random magic they added. This movie could have been much better if John Coffey was portrayed as an actual human and they kept out the childish magic. But surprisingly a lot of people really like this movie and i'm the minority, so watch it and go figure it out for yourself!"
"Steviestar7","10","2","4","26 July 2013"," One of my favourites
","I think I would go as far as to say that this is one of my favourite films. I love that it's a simple story of right, wrong and the goodness that some people can hold that is so strong it's magical. I recently read The Green Mile book and I can't think of any other book to film adaptation that is more faithful. About 90% matches up perfectly. The only things removed were some scenes in the nursing home that reminded Paul of Percy which didn't affect the story at all. Michael Clarke Duncan is excellent and understated as John Coffey, a role that could easily be too overplayed in the wrong hands. The Green Mile is a classic film that will never age."

It's probably more the story than the screenplay, but this movie is still one of the best i've ever seen. The acting is really good, the story fits the book. I think this movie is more for adults, but it can be appreciated by everyone. I wouldn't suggest it to too young people, but it can be a good movie for 10+. From the little mouse to the big man, this movie as no equal, up to date, on the story of a life-sentenced person.

All the actors in the movie fit perfectly for their characters & they really did an extraordinary job. At times, i feel like why did not i get bored of watching a movie with a run-time of 3:00 hours? because every player in the movie was absolutely amazing. Michael Duncan was exceptional & Tom hanks did justice to his character as well. Although, i really feel sorry for Michael Duncan RIP, Nevertheless, John Coffey will always be remembered in our lives just like in the movie as an AnGel :) In a nut shell, this movie is about GOOD vs EVIL, & it conveys the message that TRUTH shall always prevail & EVIL must die.<br/><br/>Amazing work!!"
"MildInconvenienceMan","9","2","4","21 October 2012"," A classic - that delves into the question of what if someone truly good was put on death row?
","This film is one of the best films of all time, as it is completely unexpected and just outstanding. When I first watched this film I was never expecting one of the characters to have some kind of god given power, and even when I've now watched it a few times I still am left mesmerised every time it happens. The emotion in this film is one of its key parts, it utilises the idea of prison and especially death row, to show what people are really like even when they face 'the mile'.<br/><br/>The acting is without parallel in this film with key appearances of Michael Clarke Duncan who plays John Coffey so, so well, he so amazingly simple yet so deep at the same time he is truly a gentle giant, and it is a pleasure to watch. Tom Hanks also plays the head guard of death row extremely well, as he really has all authority and its interesting to see how he plays the role when many others would have become corrupted in such a position. The rest of the inmates all have their own detailed stories, as well as the guards, there is so many different tones in this film. It can really be sen that every kind of person can relate to someone in this film, an thats what makes it so great.<br/><br/>The use of the mouse is also something that must have been amazingly tedious to film but the responsiveness of the animal is something that is rarely seen in other films, so this is again something that makes this film amazing. The film is also long in terms of what we can normally expect for film length, but you don't notice it, I felt it could have gone on for many more hours and I would have enjoyed every minute of it. <br/><br/>The complexity of the relationships between guards and prisoners is also something that perfectly portrayed in this film, the idea that we are all humbled with this idea of our final mile, of what ever it may be for each person. Which leads to my next point about the meaning of this film, that there is so much hatred in this world, even though the characters had done bad things, there was only really one of them who was a truly bad person all the rest were humbled, and it was disgusting to see audiences to the executions cheering for revenge. <br/><br/>A lot of this film also was in what was not said and mere looks of trust were enough to reassure the audience so that we believed the story even though ti is obviously fantasy, but it is made so believable by these connections and outstanding acting.<br/><br/>This film is one of the best films of all time, and should definitely be watched by anyone, more than anything, to make them feel humbled that someone so pure and so good could be killed for something they didn't do, its portrayed so well - definitely a filming great and a classic."

","Absolutely one of the best movies of all time!!! The storyline, the adaptation, the directing and acting ensemble was just magnificent! I have seen this movie MANY times and NEVER get bored of it! Not many movies move your emotions like the Green Mile as well! I could not understand in 2000 how it did not win or get nominated for more awards!! Hanks wasn't even nominated for an Oscar? Probably because 3 wins in-a-row would be unheard of! It's crazy how Stephen King, the master of horror novels has had many great screen adaptations, but his 2 best were prison based flicks, Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile .. with the same Director I might add! How come they just don't make these great movies anymore? The 1990's was a great decade for movies! Silence of the Lambs, Braveheart, Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile, Titanic, Jurassic Park, Shindler's List, all in my top 10 of all time! The past decade has been ""crap"" in comparison! Again, The Green Mile ... a great movie!"

","The Green Mile is THE most moving film I have ever seen. John Coffey is accused of murdering two children. He is eight feet tall and has a childlike mentality, often crying himself to sleep in his cell. With a run time of just over 3 hours, you can be sure to have an immense amount of sympathy for this 'Big Friendly Giant' as he awaits his execution on Death Row. You can also be sure to shed a few tears at the end of the film, so don't forget the tissues ;) This film is most definitely a 10 outta 10, although arguably deserves much more. It is a film guaranteed to make you feel an exotic cocktail of emotions, and with the sad ending, it will be on your mind for long after it finishes.

","The first time I saw this movie I had flicked it on about 20 minutes in while it was playing on the History channel. I was working on a school project at the time and I turned the television on just as a little distraction to keep me entertained abit. I kept the movie on for about 45 minutes until I realized just what I had accidentally tuned in to. I forced myself to turn the TV off because I knew this was a movie one needed to watch and devote all their attention to - and if I would have kept it on my project would never of been touched.<br/><br/>About a week or two later I found myself with an empty Saturday afternoon, I sat down to watch a little TV. To my unexpected surprise The Green Mile was airing again on History channel and I caught it about 20 minutes after the part I had originally left off. I simply had to watch the rest of it, and quite quickly, the movie I suspected to be a deep & powerful story evolved into so much more.<br/><br/>When the movie ended I sat through the credits unable to move, paralyzed in awe. The story was unbelievably powerful, messages were abundant, acting was terrific, cinematography was outstanding and I simply can't praise this movie enough. Keep in mind I missed the beginning of the movie and a small portion of the middle and this is the way I feel - as soon as I get a chance I will buy this movie and watch it through fully. It shook in a way very very few other films have ever managed to even come close to and I immediately knew the answer to that perplexing question, which before this experience I never believed was answerable: If you could only pick one movie to ever own and watch for the rest of your life, what would it be? <br/><br/>Do NOT let the runtime scare you (I have always had a mean bias against movies running longer than 2 hours) it will be over much sooner than you want it to be. Watch this movie alone with no distractions. Have a tissue box next to you, if you let yourself understand the characters and the situations there is no doubt in my mind that little box will come in handy. This movie WILL move you - be prepared."
"Gunn","10","2","4","17 February 2010"," Perfection!
","""The Green Mile"" is a GREAT movie, a Masterpiece. In a great movie everything ""clicks"" during the filming and this is a perfect example. The cast of Green Mile is so perfect that one cannot picture or imagine anyone else in these roles. The most crucial character in this film was John Coffey, and he was the last one cast. John Coffey is such a complex character not only in psychologically but in physical appearance. Michael Clarke Duncan was suggested by Bruce Willis, who'd read Stephen King's book, at the last moment and he delivered in spades. He is the heart of this movie. The other cast members: the always dependable, Tom Hanks, David Morse and James Cromwell, the brilliant Sam Rockwell and Barry Pepper, the terrific character actors Jeffrey DeMunn, Graham Greene, Harry Dean Stanton and veteran Dabbs Greer, along with Bonnie Hunt and Patricia Clarkson and newcomer Doug Hutchison. The late Michael Jeter turned in an Oscar worthy performance as the Cajun prisoner Eduard Delacroix. Last but not least was Mr. Jingles the talented mouse, who was portrayed by a group of equally talented stunt-mice. Frank Darabont deserves credit for his vision and directing which put everything into place. Kudos also to David Tattersall's stunning cinematography, Thomas Newman's whimsical score and to Stephen King for a brilliant story. There are so many great scenes in this film that it's difficult to single out one, but the scene where Paul Edgecombe (Hanks) asks John Coffey (Duncan) what he can do for him, when he knows Coffey is innocent is extremely poignant. I should also give credit to Terence Marsh and William Cruse who ""created"" the Green Mile set. This film is on a par with its counterpart ""The Shawshank Redemption"" also by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont."

","It's rare that I'm moved to tears by a film; I'm rather hard to impress. Schindler's List, for example, almost got me crying -- almost, but not quite. The Shawshank Redemption is another one. This film, however, never fails to make me weep.<br/><br/>John Coffey's life as a Christ-like figure on Death Row is touching and moving. The only reason this fails to achieve a ten-vote from me is because of a certain scene involving ""punishment"" that seems out of character -- I'll say no more than that, but you will recognize it when you see it.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say there is not much to be written about this film other than that it is worthy of the highest praise; if you have not seen it, you must do so -- and if you have, then you know why it moved me to tears."

","I recall in 1999, seeing this and how fresh it is for me, still. I think The Green Mile is an amazing cinema experience, for me and for those with heart. I was into the story watching these guards doing their jobs, going through the telling of this and then enter, prisoner John Coffey,(Michael Clark Duncan) with this power for healing. This was a real true to form tear-jerker. <br/><br/>Hanks, playing Edgecomb, the guard that you couldn't help but care about, was made outstandingly well, by Tom's work in this one. What a terrific pick, for that role! I just get this different feeling of vulnerability, when I watch ""The Green Mile"", I wasn't familiar with the book as many others were. I just don't think that has any effect on my understanding or coming to better grip with the storyline. <br/><br/>I wish that I could go back and see it again, in that movie theater, go back in time (so to speak )because it seemed to speak to me then. About doing for others I think, that was the biggest thought that I can bring away with me. The healer, (Duncan), John was huge and intimidating, yet he was a very important element in Paul's life and his wife's especially. If not for Paul taking the chance, nothing would have changed for Jan most likely. I enjoyed Warden Hal, ( James Cromwell-""Babe"" 1995) his part was just right, the direction and the cinematography was very simply perfect for this prison drama. Delacroix, (Jeter- now deceased) was a great side character, and who can really forget 'Wild Bill' Wharton, (Sam Rockwell) who ed all over the place in there, what a demon that guy was.<br/><br/>All that aside though, this was a 'thought-provoking' wonder on film-stock. It leaves you feeling and thinking more than anything else. I recommend highly for those who love a grand story with an incredible ending. Thanks to Director, Frank Darabont. I also am amazed at the fact that Stephen King wrote such a touching and fair work like this. (****)"

"david-2849","10","2","4","13 February 2006"," Biblical
","Stephen King is something of an oddity to me. On the one hand he comes out with pulp trash like Thinner and The Stand, both works of utter banality written by a bored and cynical author whose only interest lies in the accumulation of wealth and the mass production of brainless rubbish. On the other he creates works of pure genius like Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile whose literary importance are, IMO, right up there with the greats. This latter is, undoubtedly, the work of a literary genius and it should be taught in schools no less. The plot wastes nothing, driving home its point from start to finish and wasting not a single millimetre of film in the process, from the subtlety of John Coffey's name (JC, Jesus Christ) to the crucial importance of every character, including the detestable but ultimately pitiable Percy and the vile, and yet somehow funny Wild Bill. That we are made to laugh at Wild Bill's antics is no sick frivolity on King's part. This movie delves deep into the human soul and asks us exactly what we think right and wrong is, what we think of justice and how we perceive the duplicity of faith and kharma. We are involved. We are made to gasp, cry, shout and cheer. And in our involvement we are forced to make uncomfortable alliances. Is Coffey the second coming? Or is he merely an angel, adrift on earth and 'lost in the dark'? His benevolence is clearly complete. He has no capacity for evil, and yet he is executed for one of the most evil crimes imaginable. His cross is a chair, his disciples are mere prison guards, and yet the injustice of his death is no less potent. Only the symbolism of his place in the world and our empathy with it are questionable compared with the unsullied perfection of King's inspiration. This is a movie rife with subtle asides and depths you'll miss if you blink. But also a movie of great passion and unending love for the art of storytelling. Not a scene is out of place. Not a camera angle goes astray. Hanks, Hutchison and above all else, Clark-Duncan, create a masterpiece between them. Duncan's moving performance is simply breathtaking. Here is an actor used to portraying henchmen, hired goons and 'gangstas' giving the performance of his life as nothing less than the most tear-jerking softy since Bambie. Not since King Kong has such a muscle bound hulk touched the hearts of so many. I defy even the hardest of hearts not to blub as Coffey pleads to be spared the execution hood because he fears the dark. Hanks puts in another sterling performance. Better than Private Ryan, but possibly less than Forrest Gump. This is Hanks as Hanks. Hanks as you know him from such films as Sleepless in Seattle, The Money Pit or Turner and Hooch. Hanks as funny man in a not altogether funny situation. Hanks as the put upon Hanks making do the best he can. But ultimately Hanks at his most convicted. He liked making this movie. You can tell. Which is good, because anyone associated with production of The Green Mile should be proud of their creation."

It was good because it began as your average prison start that didn't exactly blow me off my seat but it the gradually became more and more interesting until it eventually began to become a bit stupid when the guards discovered that the man on death row had some powers. <br/><br/>The story is about an execution place where everything is normal until tall, mean looking, colored man enters and the saying don't judge a book by it's cover definitely occurs with this film when he touches everyone's heart and the workers there start to query the execution of the tall colored man.<br/><br/>I'll admit that when the guards call out ""Dead man walking down the green mile"" it does become quite upsetting for the characters that you have just gotten used to are becoming executed. The acting is very, very good which should have won some awards.<br/><br/>I'm not overly keen on the fact of the powers that the colored man gains powers, I found that that turned a normal movie in to a weird movie and those two certainly do not go well together.

He met John Coffey, a physically shaped and tall prisoner who was wrongfully accused of the murders of 2 little girls and unfortunately sentenced to death. This guy, a very kind person despite his threatening shape, was in reality a healer who cures with Faith, and he did miracles, like resurrecting a mouse who was crushed by a rebellious warden, curing the wife of Edgecomb's friend (who was in the death article) and of course curing Paul's painful urinal infection.<br/><br/>But the most important thing that happened, is when Paul took the hand of John Coffey after he resurrected the mouse. It gave him almost immortality, cause in the end, Paul Edgecomb told his girl friend that he was 108 years old, and I was surprised for a man who takes walks outside with such shape and age. Unfortunately, all of his friends he had and loved, including his wife, died while he grew older and older.

The length of the movie may be much for some, It was fine for me. It certainly isn't a quick snack, it's a main meal!

","I am a 13 year old girl and i watched The Green Mile last night with 2 of my mates at a sleepover, i noticed all the people posting on here are all adults and thought the film was brilliant etc etc blah blah blah. I am 13 and this film literally blew me away, i was so shocked! I was expecting something boring we were all going 2 fall asleep halfway through, but i was surprised. John Coffey is so cute! We all decided that was what made the film so sad and moving, how he was a bit dumb and wanted to leave the light on. I had to remind myself that it was NOT real, because i was almost crying and that would do nothing for my street cred. lol. <br/><br/>That execution scene when they did not wet the sponge was so disgusting my mates could not watch it but as i had not seen it before i decided to give it my full attention all the way through. <br/><br/>This is one of those films you'll never forget for the rest of your life no matter how many other films you watch. Some other films i will never forget are The Rock and Fallen they are amazing. A book i will always cry at and never forget is I Am David.

This film is one of the best i have ever seen. The characterisation is sublime, the direction is flawless and the range of emotions this film provokes in you is truly incredible.<br/><br/>I won't single out an individual performance as this would discredit the rest of the cast, they are all superb; every one of them.<br/><br/>For anyone who hasn't seen this film yet, watch it, i'm sure you will like it. You will empathise with every character, you will detest Percy with a passion, you will respect all the guards except Percy and you will sympathise with John Coffey (like the drink only not spelt the same) <br/><br/>You will Laugh, you will cry, you will witness a truly horrific death, and you will almost feel it.<br/><br/>TRUST ME, YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS MASTERPIECE<br/><br/>10/10"

","The simplification of characters, the eternal battle between the 'angels' and the evil that we don't want to see on the screen anymore and the utter professionalism of Hanks acting make this film pretentious and conventional. Well, Hanks insists on treating the condemned humanely, but not a word against the death penalty. Oh, Hanks, the patriotic American son that ""we"" love so much... of course, he doesn't want to take a minimum risk by pronouncing a single word with a political/radical connotation.

","A beautiful beautiful movie. One of the greatest masterpeaces of all kind. Even though it's three hours long,  I watched it untill the end. straight, one pee stop ;). Although containing some very disturbing images, Green Mile, the (1999) Is one extrordinery movie, in wich everything connects. It makes you wonder. it creates inner feelings. from the begining, you just know, john coffey didn't kill those little girls. From the begining of the movie you see how evil persy is. from shouting ""A dead man walkin'! Dead man walkin' here, people! A dead man walkin'!"", too where he tries to kill Mr. jingles, and when it killed it. and to the very disturbing point when he didn't wet the spunge. From that point, you just feel you want to make him pain... It shows how much sadism can be painful, if it isn't ceing controlable. Tom Hanks is the greatest actor, or one of them. each movie is being putt into your memory, and it's a feeling like your'e in another planet, watching earth at all it's glory..."

","After many years, and hundreds of films, I really thought that The Godfather was the finished article, it couldn't be bettered.<br/><br/>Until that is, I bought The Green Mile on a whim.<br/><br/>I confess that I am a huge fan of Stephen Kings early work, Carrie, Salems Lot, The Stand,( in which Gary Sinese is tremendous)Christine,etc. Although in my opinion, most of his writing since Misery has been pretty grim.<br/><br/>This is very different indeed.<br/><br/>As an example, when I bought the film, I came home and stuck it in DVD player, just to watch the first 15 minutes, to see if I could get a grip on the plot. I was concerned that it would be another Geralds Game or Delores Claibourne and would be better in the bin.<br/><br/>I watched the first 15 minutes and checked the clock, and found that 50 minutes had passed!!.  As i had to go work, I Left it alone.<br/><br/>Later I watched it with my wife, and when it was over, we watched it all again.<br/><br/>This without doubt the best film I have ever seen.  I have recommended it to numerous people who have, without fail come back to and said ""what a film , this is the best they have ever seen"".<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is excellent, and in my opinion gives an Oscar winning performance when he is not even on screen!!, in a portion that he does with John Coffey ( Michael Clarke Duncan), Who tries to explain himself to Hanks.<br/><br/>The opening part of the film, where a posse is searching for two missing girls, is frightening when they catch up with Coffey, you could see someone shoot Coffey, and it wouldn't have been out of place.<br/><br/>David Morse is very good, as always, with a dry wit, that permeates through his role, similar to Victor Borge in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>Doug Hutchinson as Percy Wetmore is tremendous, if ever i wanted to give someone in a film a punch in the face, he is the one. He plays the slimy, backside kissing, hateful, know it all to a tee.<br/><br/>The only flaw I could find in the whole film was James Cromwell.  He played his part very very well indeed, but every time I see him in a film, I think of him as Zephram Cochrane in Star Trek - First Contact, Boogying hid brains out.<br/><br/>This is an awesome film, without doubt the best of them all, better than the Godfather, not by much, but better, if you haven't seen it, watch it, and then , watch it again./"
"Kuntos_the_Destroyer","5","2","4","23 September 2001"," Bribery works with the Academy too, you know.
","Stephen King-based movies are, if anything, a mixed bag. His stories work very well when the screenwriter/ director focusses on internal tensions within the protagonist (see Stanley Kubricks The Shining, Rob Reiners Misery or Taylor Hackfords Dolores Claiborne) and they usually turn out less successfull when external horrors are 'examined'. Perhaps the best film (and certainly the most humane) based on Kings work is The Shawshank Redemption, at the time criminally ignored by both audiences and the Academy. Half a decade later, however, it's one of the most loved films of the nineties (check out the IMDb top 250; it's probably still in the top 5).<br/><br/>
Which explains why Frank Darabont took the same direction again. The Green Mile is another prison-set film (on Death Row during the Depression, actually) based on Kings writing. And again Darabont draws your attention to the characters instead of aiming for cheap thrills. There are differences aplenty, however. Most significantly, The Green Mile has supernatural aspects Shawshank didn't have. Still, the similarities are so great (and the reasons behind casting America's favourite actor Tom Hanks are so transparant) it's hard not to consider The Green Mile as anything but an attempt to translate Shawshank's critical success to box office receipts (and Golden Baldies).<br/><br/>Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's terrible. And it really is not. The Green Mile is hardly a Shawshank Redemption either, though. It's far too Oscar-friendly for that. I though Shawshank was an honest, moving and cleverly written film. The Green Mile plays the emotions up to the max however. So much so that to me it just felt a little faked. It is highly manipulative and its characters are less well rounded than those in Shawshank. Best examples? The (gratuitously) horrific electrocution scene and the sadistic guard character (the Wild Bill character is a pretty good one, too). Extra Oscar points for an extremely long running time, an annoying wraparound time set in modern time (see also: Titanic, whoever thought these wraparound things work?) and a zillion shots of people crying.<br/><br/>
It's also loaded with that so-called bleakness that works so well for the Academy. The world can be a horrible place (well duh...) in which death can be a form of release. Not wanting to be to depressing, it luckily shows the role of being humane to eachother. Yep, that's Oscar-material all right. Not too challenging or complicated, it reaffirms all which is traditionally believed in the U.S. (also of peculiar interest is the Academy's preoccupation with optimistic films related to death; see Titanic, Gladiator, American Beauty, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon even).<br/><br/>But I mentioned it's NOT a terrible film, right? Well, it isn't. The Green Mile is reasonably well (although very traditionally) directed  and at times its heart-tugging does work. Also, the acting isn't that bad. Tom Hanks I'll never really like, he's just either too bland or too much Tom Hanks The Actor for me. But the supporting performers are, within the limitations of its writings, excellent. Michael Clarke Duncan (who gets to do most of the crying) is oddly convincing as giant, retarded angel and David Morse and James Cromwell are good. The outstanding member of the cast, however, is Michael Jeter as mouse-loving Cajun inmate Del. The cinematography is also highly atmospheric and the presentation of the supernatural aspect is surprisingly subtle (as are religious undertones).<br/><br/>Solid acting and effective use of old techniques make this a watchable film, but in the end it's far too hyperbolic in it's emotions and simply too bloody long. Not really bad but as good as it's IMDb rating would have you think? Not by a long shot.<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10"
"hagerp","5","2","4","23 July 2001"," Affecting perforces offset by ridiculous plot hole - (spoilers)
","There are a number of standout performances in THE GREEN MILE, particularly by Michael Clark Duncan.  As the spiritual center and Christ figure of the story, Duncan is superb.  There are so many things to like about this movie (it is an effective and moving indictment of the death penalty) that it is sad to see it undone by a plot absurdity.<br/><br/>Any story that depends on supernatural elements requires that the audience suspend disbelief.  However, accepting supernatural elements demands consistency and logic in the other supernatural elements.<br/><br/>(Spoiler)<br/><br/>In this movie, Coffey's talent as a healer becomes known to the guards and the warden.  Near the end of the movie, Coffey is able to pass on a memory/image of the person who actually committed the crime he was convicted of to the guard/narrator (Tom Hanks).  Although Coffey is clearly innocent, we are told that nothing can be done to save him.  This is totally absurd. In the real world, where there is no evidence for actual spiritual or psychic healing, practicianers (or charlatans) enjoy fantastic success.  If there were a REAL healer, who could also transfer images from the minds of killers to other people, then publicizing his talent would be a trivial exercise.  We already know that officials came to the prison to see a mouse perform -- why wouldn't people come to see a genuine healer?  Finding powerful supporters who would argue for clemency would be the next logical step.  In essence, the momentum of the movie is to kill Coffey since he is a Christ-figure, and the plot is the ultimate casualty.<br/><br/>Trying to paper over the hole with the idea that Coffey was ready to lay down the burden of empathizing all of the world's pain and embrace death just didn't work and felt condescending.<br/><br/>Rating: 5 = Performances (8) - plot hole (3)"

","Frank Darabont proves once again why he should be the only one to touch any Stephen King-related. This adaptation of the best seller series is stellar. The parts he removed from the book are the parts that shouldn't have been included anyway (and they are only minor at that). The story is tight, the acting is top notch, the set design is just what I imagine when I read the novels.<br/><br/>Did I mention that the cast is first rate? From Hank's understated and moving performance as Paul Edgecombe to Clarke's soulful, sad and touching display as Coffey, there isn't a bad apple in the bunch. OK, it is a little long but it hooks you from the moment go. Not once was I bored or glancing at my watch. Darabont keeps the pace steady and never lets the material get ahead of him.<br/><br/>This is a great movie. How the Oscars totally ignored this one is beyond me.<br/><br/>

"rem-14","Null","2","4","8 June 2000"," A film that is actually better than the novel.
","There are so many reasons why 'The Green Mile' should be a bad film.  The fact that the story has been adapted from a best-selling novel, the fact that the film is over three hours long, and most of all the fact that the story is based around the supernatural powers of a man.  Curiously 'The Green Mile' is not a bad film though, infact it is a very powerful and emotive movie which can summon up fear, anxiety and tears in the same five minutes.<br/><br/>Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is a prison warden on a death row known as the Green Mile, a result of the emerald green tiles on the floor.  In the summer of 1933 John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), the biggest man you'll ever see, is sent to 'the mile' for raping and murdering two young girls. Curiously Edgecomb is not afraid of Coffey, as he is with most of his inmates, and after a while begins to suspect Coffey's innocence.<br/><br/>Hanks, once again, delivers a first-class performance, helped by the rest of the cast, noteably Michael Clarke Duncan (Armageddon) in his first major role.  There are no Hollywood heavyweights propping up the main actors, infact you probably haven't heard of any of the other actors, except for Gary Sinise, who makes a brief appearance as a newspaper journalist (this is a Tom Hanks film afterall!).<br/><br/>I read the novel before seeing the movie and in my opinion the movie wins hands down.  Although three hours may be too much for most people, it just flew by for me, and I'm not ashamed to say that I shed a tear at the end.<br/><br/>Nine out of ten and a candidate for film of the year."

"Lee Depkin","10","2","4","9 December 1999"," Powerful and spellbinding
","This is a film based on a collection of Stephen King short stories, directed by Frank Darabont, who also directed the highly acclaimed ""The Shawshank Redemption"".  It takes place in 1935, in a Louisiana penitentiary, and Paul Edgecomb (played by Tom Hanks) is a supervisor on death row in E Block, known as the green mile.  He is respected by his subordinates and the prisoners alike because he treats them all fairly.  However, his life changes when he takes charge of a new prisoner, John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a towering hulk condemned to die for the brutal rape and murder of two small girls.<br/><br/>There is so much to like about this film that I hardly know where to begin. The look of this period piece is so authentic that you are transported back to that time when justice was dispensed according to the color of your skin and at the discretion of the prison guards.  All the gritty details are here to experience, from the oppressive heat and grime to the horrors of a botched execution.  The story, which echoes the traditional Stephen King theme of good versus evil, evolves slowly, building the characters with great care.  Performances are all exemplary, with special recognition going to Hanks for being able to convey so much through mannerisms and facial expressions.  He shows compassion and understanding towards the inmates despite trying circumstances.  Michael Clarke Duncan also deserves special recognition by adeptly showing us the gentleness and vulnerability of condemned man John Coffey.  Solid supporting performances by an all-star cast round out this exceptional film.  Even though it is just over three hours long, nothing is superfluous.  I highly recommended it, and enthusiastically give it 10 out of 10.  See it, then for an encore treat go rent ""The Shawshank Redemption"", if you have not yet seen that one."

","SYNOPSIS:
Everything begins to change for the guards on death row when John Coffey comes to the green mile. Unexplainable events start taking place that change their lives for the better and for some... the worst.<br/><br/>REVIEW:
I have to start off by saying the acting in the film is incredible. Something you expect with a cast like this. Tom Hanks, David Morse, James Cromwell, Michael Clarke Duncan and the list goes on. Sam Rockwell is one of my favorite actors working today and he plays Wild Bill so well. I also really loved the performance by Doug Hutchison as Percy. You can really feel the tension of the room when Percy walks in. Then I swear Michael Clarke Duncan has to restock on fluids heavy after losing as much as he did for this film. The man can cry for days I couldn't believe it. Then Tom Hanks had me feeling his pain when trying to pee, I started sweating myself. If you've seen the movie you know what I'm talking about. The direction by Frank Darabont was done really well. He had very good timing and kept the flow of this 2 and a half hour film smooth. I do have to say that there is an element of this film that took me out a little. When the unexplainable events start taking place I was down a little bit. I like when things stay grounded and realistic and so for me, I was slightly disappointed. Other than that, there's not many bad things to say about this film. One of the last scenes of this film was beautifully acted and delivered from Darabont and left a good taste in my mouth. For that, this is a definite recommend. 7.6/10."

","Writer/director Frank Darabont returns after the amazing THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION to enter the same setting; the American prison system. Although like SHAWSHANK based on a Stephen King novel it is a very different film.<br/><br/>An old prison guard named Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer) spins a fabulous yarn about his younger years when he was running 'The Green Mile' which was death row in Louisiana. Really it is about his meeting with a new inmate in John Coffey (great performance from Michael Clarke Duncan who was nominated for an Oscar).<br/><br/>This is not your ordinary Stephen King movie. It is not in the realm of horror, but the character of John Coffey is a very King character to me. Something rare in film happens here. It may happen on a much more regular role in books, but in film you generally have 2 hours to show your characters, show your plot and solve whatever problem happens in the film. This one runs at over 3 hours and never seems to be long, drawn out or too long. The rare thing is all major characters are really fully developed before you really know much about John Coffey. All characters are running when Coffey's character and story take over the film. It takes some major ingredients to do that; time, great acting, great direction and a great story.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is amazing as the younger version of Paul Edgecomb and is surrounded by some great talent as well with the likes of David Morse as his working companion Brutal, Sam Rockwell as the crazy inmate Wild Bill, Graham Greene as inmate Arlen Bitterbuck and Harry Dean Stanton as the kooky Toot-Toot just to name a few. As well I think Doug Hutchison does an incredible job playing a character such as prison guard Percy. You should grow to hate him and perhaps not show him any sympathy as his character reaches a horrifying and ironic end.<br/><br/>So, you don't need to be a Stephen King fan or Tom Hanks fan to really enjoy this film (even though I would consider myself in both of those camps). You just need to enjoy character driven and interesting stories."

It's golden leaves and large meadows of grass ... It's the old healing English movie I like.
The picture of Dell's execution showed that my whole heart was pulled up, just like the electric current running through Dell's whole body. Sadness, sympathy, fear, and anger also penetrated my whole body. I seemed to feel a part of Dell's pain. This movie also made me feel the death fear and the confession of my crime before the execution of the death row prisoner. The jailer except that Pell, the other people are not like I saw in other prison films. Be violent and abuse the prisoner. On the contrary, they are very kind. They call doctors who have broken their fingers. They whisper in order to take care of the emotions of the criminals. They are very caring for the little mouse ""Mr. King"", and will be punished a few days before execution. The inmates who spent the money went out to start the drill ... Admittedly, Paul asked John Kofi to rescue Mrs. Melin, which made me feel strange to him. But I believe Kofi is willing. After all, he is so kind and feels the same about everything in the world. The picture of Kofi saving Mrs. Merlin is also very touching:
""What's your name?""<br/><br/>""John Coffey, homonymous with coffee, but spelled differently.""<br/><br/>I really love Kofi. His eyes have always been compassionate, tender, pitiful and a little scared. There is so much pain in the world, but you can feel the same, you are working hard, angel."

","A very moving masterpiece. He USES their love for each other to kill them. Every day is like this. I feel the pain of the world. It seemed to me to be a kind of heart, a kind of compassion, very moving, that people are so stupid, to hurt in a loving way. The parents' love for the dead girl turned to hate for John, and even asked for more killings. It is really a very good contrast, so many wars in human history are not the same, the aggressors to love their country to exploit other countries, defenders to love their country to fight to the death, in fact, are in the use of love to kill people so there is war. The compassion and wisdom of buddhas and bodhisattvas is true love. They can suffer injustice when necessary and sacrifice themselves for the sake of others. John, this is the path of bodhisattva. amitabha"

","The plot was quite complex. The characters got good character development, it had some nice unpredictable twists and the characters were very complex. The guy with the mouse's death was very emotional, as was John Coffee's and saving the dying woman. The murder of the girls at the beginning was also very emotional. There was one mediocre scene. The scenes with Tom Hanks' character and his wife were a little dull.<br/><br/>John Coffee was probably the best character. Although all the main characters are good characters, I don't think any one of them was a truly outstanding character. None of the characters had any truly unique powers (except Coffee) or circumstances for example. It was just one movie, despite it being a long one it's hard to develop even the main characters well in a single movie. My biggest problem with the characters is they just felt too normal, none of them seemed truly unique, which is ok because that's common for films that take place in the real world."

","The magic of the film is strong. Such a film, which uses supernatural power as the key narrative factor of the film, is destined to make the answer of many profound problems found through magic, not by human. From the perspective of supernatural forces, it is actually a simple redemption story. However, the director has extended too many themes, and there are no foucs among the several themes, which makes the film's original meaning of ""redemption"" chaotic and obscure. And the way of elaboration is a bit more contorted and contrived. The procrastinating rhythm and overly complex theme make the character, scene design, and macro structure of the film very superficial, rather than serving the theme. Therefore, although the topics discussed in the film are diverse and difficult, the deterrent effect on the audience is obviously insufficient."

The casting was absolute brilliance, every actor performs their roles amazingly well. That being said the roles Paul Edgecomb and John Coffey play by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan steal the show, and I would make a case saying this is the highlight of Tom Hank's film career. For a film that just hits the 3 hour mark you will never find yourself looking at your phone or watch to see when this film ends, and when it ends your going to be sad that this gem of film is over. I would heavily recommend watching this with a box of tissues near by as there are many tear jerks throughout the film especially towards the end. One thing I find that goes unmentioned in reviews on this film is the soundtrack, when you watch the execution of John Coffey listen to the music as best as you can, as you will find that it's the main reason you shed a few tears. Too me this is the definition of prison movies (yes I believe this movie is better than The Shawshank Redemption) and is the first movie I think of when someone says Tom Hanks or prison I think of this movie.

","This is not a review in my opinion, but a questioning.<br/><br/>First of all, i didn't read the book. Also since John wants to die in the movie it may sound disrespectful to search for a way to save him. However; he is an angel, living miracle and I wanted to see him alive at the end of the movie. So, I made a little research about death penalty in US and how to save someone from it.<br/><br/>It is possible to say that, ""death penalty"" is seen as a valued term . Because it is the most clear example that showes the difference between guilt and innosence. So, turning away from a death row decision is a very very hard decision. Even if we assume that a court (I don't know if the court makes the decision, just for the example.) turns away from a death penalty, it will create two different ideas which may create headaches for the government. First, people will start to judge past cases about death penalties and they might ask that ""What if they were innocent?"" Second, people's trust in law can decrease and might ask ""Is this how our government ""punishes"" criminals?"". In both cases there are questions against government, so this is why turning away from a death penalty is a rare event.<br/><br/>However, numbers show that more that 150 people were freed from death row since 1976 in US. Since none of them are people born with prophet's miracles like John did, there might be a way to save him! He can revive a dead animal or cure a sick person in front of the jury or shake hands with them to show the reality as he did to Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>Lastly, even if John got away from the death row, his life will be the opposite of what he wants. So maybe death is the right choice for him. Some parts of my hearth want to see him alive, other parts are just pleased with the ending..."

","The green mile is probably the best Stephen king movie ever made after the The Shining. It's really a film about believing in God, even if you know that you are going to die for your sins. It's just a really sad movie and I found it really hard not to get emotional when people realize that they don't have much time left and that God maybe wants to know what their last word is before the leave this world for good. Tom Hanks and the cast is amazing and the film never gets tiresome or boring its over 2 hours run.

","I'll keep it short with no spoilers:<br/><br/>Nice drama movie.
Good story and acting. Good atmosphere and shots.<br/><br/>The whole movie feels a bit like The Shawshank Redemption. Same kind of shots, colour and atmosphere. Off course that can happen when the director and writer are the same, as is the case with The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.
If The Shawshank Redemption is a 10/10(my opinion), I find this movie a 8/10.
I do fancy the story, but I do not like it as much as The Shawshank Redemption.
The score is good, but also not as good as with The Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>Recommended: Yes.
However, brace yourself, it is a long movie and you need to follow the story. No problem, because it is a good movie, but something to keep in mind.<br/><br/>Tip: First watch The Green Mile and after that watch The Shawshank Redemption, if you at this point did not already watch The Shawshank Redemption."

","One of the points critics often mention is the fact that the guards on death row are too kind. Too sensitive. This might be true, I can't tell, I've never been on death row before. Neither have most of the critics, I assume. Maybe the nefarious Percy was indeed more realistic, but if there's one absolutely awful person it's gotta be him. I think that Death Row should really be like this. They may be criminals, but they're still people who are about to die. Some kindness can go a long way.<br/><br/>This picture might be somewhat predictable, cheesy even. Yet that is not the point here. This film is meant to inspire you. To make you think. Think about the world we live in. John Coffey's speech shows this. Powerful words delivered with great eloquence. 
""Mostly, I'm tired of people being ugly to each other. I'm tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world every day. There's too much of it. It's like pieces of glass in my head, all the time... Can you understand?""<br/><br/>Never in my life have I been more moved by words. John Coffey was a shining light, in a world of immense darkness. Some may call this movie naive. Only meant for the gullible. I don't think that's true. This movie makes you painfully aware of all the injustice and wrong in this world. And John Coffey knew it. He knew it all. He did not stand up to heal more people. He asked to be released of it. I do not call that gullible or naive. I call that thought-provoking. In the real world, too, people are aware.<br/><br/>This film is beautiful. Three hours will fly by. Your emotions will be a rollercoaster. This isn't just a good movie.

","All of the performances and technical aspects on display here are excellent. The only major problem with this film is the pacing, especially in the beginning. This movie has many amazing scenes, but it also has scenes that go all kinds of nowhere. The scenes with Paul in the nursing home feel so out of place. The only purpose to them is to reincorporate the film being shown later on. There are a number other scenes like that, where nothing of much substance takes place. The only reason I can think of to justify is this: All of the great scenes were shot, but someone down the line thought the film needed more to stretch it out to three hours for god knows what reason, and they just thought of the most generic and unimportant things to address in this emotionally moving story. In conclusion, it's a really good three hour movie that could've been a great 2 or 2.5 hour movie."

","Prison guards on death row during the Great Drepression in Cold Mountain Penitentiary. Tom Hanks, playing a prison supervisor, showcases his acting chops in this fantasy laden Stephen King story adapted for the screen. Along with Hanks, the movie is loaded with many seasoned actors who step up and give this dirge of a movie much needed energy and life. One of my favorite actors is Sam Rockwell who played 'Wild Bill' Wharton. As Wild Bill he played a crazy man and spent time wearing a straight jacket in the rubber room. All he wanted was a piece of corn bread. With a solid screenplay you are convinced there was such a prison and Michael Clark Duncan had special supernatural skills. You'll have to watch the movie to see what I mean."

","I hadn't seen this movie in awhile, & only just now tripped over a Sundance reairing of its last 10 minutes. I was annoyed that dish gives it 3Â½:4 stars, it being an extremely rare case of a Hanks movie I can tolerate, and the fact of these last minutes (from the execution to the ""finis"") touching me into tears tells that. Hanks didn't portray his character at the last, but even so something of him, in which his portrayal was so ""lived-in"" effective, still embodied his older self played by a different actor. But also a pang of sorrow came to me over the untimely loss of Michael Clark Duncan, who likewise turned out nowhere near a phoned-in performance, & ever since the cinemagoing public have been diminished by the lack of his presence in ... well, a fill-in-the-blank on that. ""How unfortunate."" Still we do have what body of work in which he did appear, & if The Green Mile may be accounted the apex of that sadly truncated filmography, that is certainly nothing to moan much about; its premise may not be champagne-&-tiger-prawns delectable to the eye & ears, but that he and Hanks (and David Morse, rarely better himself) imbued into it such depth in their portrayals that we don't even see that they ARE acting, gives this film certain joys through its pains that render it uniquely inspirational.

"TheMovieDiorama","9","0","0","25 February 2018"," The Green Mile is a near perfect story film.
","A term I like to use for a film that is purely focussed on the story. Structured so well that you are on board from start to finish, with a suitable beginning, middle and end. That is what makes a story film. Having now just watched this for the first time, The Green Mile is easily one of Tom Hanks' best films. I'm sure you've all seen it, a prison executioner for prisoners in Death Row encounters a new arrival who causes some unusual happenings. The ability to perform miracles. Ok so I'm going to do this slightly differently. My only negative with this film is the usage of the supernatural elements. Now I know it's a vital aspect of the story, but I'm just not a fan. Obviously used to highlight the moral implications of capital punishment where perhaps some prisoners may actually be innocent, I just find there are other ways to convey this in a more realistic manner. Not Frank Darabont's fault, Stephen King's source material is hit and miss for me. Aside from that personal preference, I found The Green Mile to be utterly captivating and near perfect. Darabont's direction, yet again similarly with 'The Shawshank Redemption', screams confidence. Long takes entirely focussing on the characters. Tom Hanks, David Morse, Barry Pepper, Sam Rockwell, James Cromwell all gave emotionally powerful performances. Michael Clarke Duncan though, a-whole-nother level. So much crying yet his dialogue is so powerful. There is one absolutely masterful scene where he holds Hanks' hand, the camera is all on Clarke and he just talks. Just...words. Then one tear rolls down his face and I get them feels. I feeeeeel it. Raw damn powerful emotion. Musical score was gorgeous. The execution scenes were tense and hard to watch. Percy was the perfect embodiment of evil. Well-structured three act narrative and, finally, a sombre conclusion that leaves you feeling empty inside. Safe to say, The Green Mile is the quickest three hours I've spent watching a film. Thoroughly enjoyed it."

When I saw the running time of the film I sat down rather reluctantly to view it. I remember becoming engrossed in it & never noticed the three hours passing by - always a sign of a good movie. Yesterday I returned to the film again after 16 years and although this time I did feel it's length somewhat, it had lost none of it's power to thoroughly captivate. Perfectly cast and performed, it provides amusement, high drama & ultimately for the audience - tears. It is a fable / fairytale for adults with important & poignant messages about life (and of course death) that we all need to consider.

This is a heartwarming film that pulls you inward and makes you truly feel for its characters. It's one of the better adaptations of a King novel."

The movie's pacing faithfully feels like a Stephen King novel making it's message even more impactful. <br/><br/>It has a slow start but that is all necessary in the end.

","THE GREEN MILE - 1999<br/><br/>Directed by Frank Darahbont<br/><br/>Starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan and Doug Hutchinsons<br/><br/>Plot Overview: ​Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) walked the mile with a variety of cons. He had never encountered someone like John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a massive black man convicted of brutally killing a pair of young sisters. Coffey had the size and strength to kill anyone, but not the demeanour. Beyond his simple, naive nature and a deathly fear of the dark, Coffey seemed to possess a prodigious, supernatural gift. Paul began to question whether Coffey was truly guilty of murdering the two girls.<br/><br/>I mean if King's book was as good as this movie, it has skyrocketed to the top of my to-read list. Frank Darahbont directed 'The Shawshank Redemption', which is one of my favourite films of all time. So naturally, upon hearing he directed the film I was about to watch, I had exceptionally high expectation. And he exceeded them. This is a powerful, moving, sensationally acted masterpiece of cinema and I have no doubt in my mind it will one day be recognised as a classic.<br/><br/>Lets look at the story. It is a slow burning tale but this works heavily into the film's favour. The writing for this movie is phenomenal and every line of dialogue is so cleverly written. This movie is THREE HOURS long but I will tell you here and now that it doesn't feel like it at all. Perhaps a scene or two could have been cut or shortened down to slightly decrease the run time but that is honestly just nitpicking. <br/><br/>I love the ending for this movie and the ambiguous nature around it. The slight tinge of hope and optimism is such a powerful and moving way to end the film on.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks was exceptional, as always, as Paul Edgecrombe. As far as protagonists in films goes, Edgecrombe was a fairly decent one.<br/><br/>Michael Clarke Duncan was extraordinary as John Coffey and deserved to win the Oscar, unfortunately he did not. Coffey is a prime example of sensational character writing and development. He is such a likable and fascinating character that you can't help but feel sorry for him and be invested in his story. Truly exceptional acting and writing.<br/><br/>Doug Hutchinsons was fantastic as Percy and I wholeheartedly believe he could have competed with Duncan for the Best Supporting Actor, should he have been nominated. Percy was a snivelling, smug, little dirt- bag whom I utterly despised and wanted his head on a spike. Credit to the writer, director and Hutchinson himself.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell was also phenomenal as Wild Bill. Similar to Percy, Bill was a loathsome character who I have no sympathy for but that really helps sell the greatness of his character. You despise him and everything the sick creep stands for but you can't help being invested in his story and interesting in his character. While I am not too familiar with most of King's work, if this standard of character(along with Percy and Coffey) is common throughout his work, I can 100% understand why he is renowned as a writer.<br/><br/>The other supporting cast, such as David Morse's Brutus or Michael Jeter's Eduard Delecrozx were all excellently written and acted. <br/><br/>The costume and set design for this movie was excellent. Both the cinematography and editing were amazing. Surprisingly, the special effects on Mr Jingles' were also pretty good.<br/><br/>My expectations for this movie were perhaps unfairly high when I sat down to watch this movie. But if my expectations were unfairly high, then I think a level headed first watch of this movie would have shown me the light. As a whole, I think The Green Mile is a truly exceptional and sensational masterclass of cinema. The acting, cinematography, editing, story; it is all incredible. That and more is the reason I can happily rate this movie 10 Mr Jingles' out of 10! Highly Recommend you see this movie."

","'The Green Mile' is considered by many to be one of the best films of all time and it's easy to see why it's held in such high regard. It's a brilliant film with a story that has it all - there aren't many films that will make you laugh and cry like this one will, and that's what makes it special.<br/><br/>Aside from the story, this film benefits from some excellent acting performances. Tom Hanks is one of my favourite actors and he is simply outstanding as the guard, likewise the rest of the cast all contribute to an all round excellent film. My one gripe, however, is the overly long running length. As a general rule I don't like long films, and while 'The Green Mile' certainly didn't feel like it had been padded out, I do feel it could have been trimmed by half-an-hour or so."

","The story is more of a personal narrative than an actual plot. The film offers an interesting perspective of the events that take place. It is seen through the eyes of a man who is over one hundred years of age, Paul Edgecomb, who is currently living in an old folks home with his friend, Elaine. During a very emotional day for Paul, he tells Elaine of a historical year in his experiences. She listens closely to his story.<br/><br/>He tells of a particular year in the 1930's. The setting is a beautifully crafted prison hall. Paul explains he used to be a kind prison guard on death row in charge of overseeing the executions. In this year, several significant activities occurred in his life: he had a terribly painful urinary infection, and met a prisoner named John Coffey. This man has been sentenced to the electric chair for the rape and murder of two innocent little girls. This man isn't like anyone else Paul has seen, however. Aside from being massive in size, he is humble, mild mannered, and caring. After several miraculous events take place that may point to the thought that John Coffey might have magical powers from God, Paul begins to doubt the crimes this so called criminal has been convicted of. <br/><br/>Throughout the story we witness three executions that in an electric chair. These capital punishment sequences have much power and significance. The electrocutions, one in particular, contain some of the most unsettling, disturbing material in film history. The movie is anti death penalty; we see the sometimes sadistic world from the prisoner guards point of view. It will put you in their shoes--and perhaps, change your opinion on the death penalty. I certainly had to think about my stand on this issue.<br/><br/>I did have questions that were not really answered by the filmmakers. I wanted more on John Coffey's magical powers; the miracles aren't investigated enough to suit our pleas. I think the movie could have also stood on a firmer platform of religion. We assume that Coffey's abilities are a gift from God from the character's dialogue, but religion itself is more of a theme in the film than a message or plot point. I can perfectly see why the writers decided to leave these elements to the audiences imagination, to provoke participation. So I suppose my objections are not really flaws, just personal aspirations.<br/><br/>""The Green Mile"" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from ""American Beauty"" in the best performance of 1999."
"Hollywood_Yoda","10","0","0","28 June 2017"," From a Serial Novel to a Serious Film
","First of all, Frank Darabont did a spectacular job directing this epic film. I was very surprised they could fit all six serial novels into one film, without splitting it up, but he mastered that. Some minor details had to be left out, if not, this film would have been diminished by nonsensical details and been a five hour film that no one would have sat through, besides die-hard Stephen King fans.<br/><br/>The casting was near perfect. I say this because the character of Percy Wetmore was a nightmare, a bully. However, in the end, Percy got to leave the Green Mile just as he'd wished! Tom Hanks could have been more compelling, it felt like he was not in the role completely (and he wondered why he didn't win another Academy Award).<br/><br/>As for Michael Clarke Duncan, may he rest in peace, he was terrific, very surprised he did not win an Academy Award. Barry Pepper was not bad, but I can't say I remember seeing him in much after The Green Mile, except in 3: THE DALE EARNHARDT STORY. Of course, David Morse was great playing Brutal, probably his best role to date.<br/><br/>And James Cromwell too, probably his best role besides L.A. CONFIDENTIAL in 1997. Let's not forget Gary Sinise, a minor role, however, very remembered (especially since this was his third pairing with Tom Hanks after FORREST GUMP and APOLLO 13). Graham Greene was great too, probably his best role since DANCES WITH WOLVES.<br/><br/>The story is great, the acting was average, and the direction was superb, well done by Darabont, who also directed 1994's THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, also a story by Stephen King. One of the best films of 1999, still a favorite of mine, and many other Stephen King fans.<br/><br/>If you still haven't seen this film, what are you waiting for? Go watch this now! And enjoy."

A film that does not have time and will be relevant at all times. This is a very complex and dramatic movie, from which tears will be drawn completely independent of you. Despite the fact that the film is very heavy, I have reviewed it many times and will look again and again to get the incomparable emotions from this film. The game of actors at the highest level, the horses fully revealed their heroes, while the movie is on, you completely immerse yourself in the world that the director opened for you, and you empathize and do not like the heroes of this film. The filing is very interesting. Not all of this world is as it might seem to us in the beginning."

","Frank Darabont and Stephen King. They have to be one of Hollywood's greatest combinations. They are just, magic.<br/><br/>The Green Mile is a film I've been delaying to watch based on the feeling of knowing how amazing it must be, so looking forward to it was pleasure enough. Sadly, I knew sooner or later I'd have to watch it. Now that I have, I both regret and appreciate having watched it. Regret because, it was in fact, as amazing as I thought it would be, and now I've watched it, thus I can't ever unwatch it, just to relive watching it again.<br/><br/>This film is over 180 minutes long, and 90 minutes in, I checked how much more of the movie was left; seeing that there was another 90 minutes to go felt like nothing but, joy. At no point did I want this film to end.<br/><br/>Every cast member, including Mr. Jingles, applause. Frank Darabont on the directors chair, excellent. Thomas Newman, could've been a little bit more emotive, because this film is at that level, but, he was wonderful nonetheless.<br/><br/>And then the story. What I kept asking, and knew of course would have to be addressed is; How are they going to let John die? How, and why? The fact that the initial answer to that question wasn't the only answer/conclusion, just made me appreciate King and/or Darabont's expertise, methodology, precision and sheer intellect even more.<br/><br/>For many I feel that, John's explanation to Paul for why he is ready to die was enough, when it actually wasn't. I could sense strongly that it wasn't, but I was willing to let it go because I felt no further consequence, would arise, but clearly, Stephen/Darabont weren't done just yet... They infected the story, with that extra bit of life.<br/><br/>The Green Mile is classic material, a must watch and didn't run a minute too long. 8.4/10."
"archynyc","10","0","0","7 June 2017"," One of the best movies
","This is a thoughtful, intelligent movie with outstanding direction. The plot veers into melodrama at times, with at least one coincidence that is overly convenient, but the humanity of the guards keeps the movie on track most of the time. Hanks is the American ideal, just, kind, capable, decent. Bonnie Hunt's performance as Edgecombe's loyal, wise, patient, and very loving wife is a pleasure to watch. Doug Hutchison is terrific as Percy, the nephew of the governor's wife who is assigned to work for Edgecombe, and whose combined arrogance and insecurity lead to disaster. And Michael Clarke Duncan is deeply moving, showing us both Coffey's innocence and his dignity.<br/><br/>It's pretty easy to make a movie where the hero saves the Earth from asteroids or blasts the bad guys into smithereens because those kinds of battles give us lots of very cool stuff to look at. It's a lot harder to make a movie like this one, holding our attention with heroism in small moments and unlikely places. Teens, who often feel that the problems of the world are too overwhelming to address, can learn from this movie that a small courtesy can have an enormous impact."

","I want everyone else who hasn't seen The Green Mile to get as much pleasure out of it as I did so if you haven't seen it I'd rather you didn't read my review. Anyway, when it comes to suspense Stephen King always delivers the goods and this film is no exception. Like The Godfather movies it is a very short three hour movie. It never drags and you never lose interest. It is a Christian allegory. John Coffey is a Christ figure and his initials indicate this. His attorney doesn't know where he came from and says it seems he came down from the sky. He has the power to perform miraculous acts of healing. A further likeness to Jesus is that it is a man called Paul who tells of him. Coffey is an intimidatingly big man but he has a child-like fear of the dark. He also has a child-like pleasure in the simple things in life like when he points out the constellation of Cassiopeia and says ""there's Cassie, the old lady in the rocking chair"". It is touching the scene where he says he had a dream about having the two wee lassies he was wrongly convicted of murdering sitting on his knees and they're all laughing with pleasure at the mouse, Mr Jingles, and his incredible antics. When Wild Bill grabs his arm the truth about these two murders is transmitted to him although Wild Bill doesn't realise it. He in turn transmits it to Paul but it is not admissible evidence in court. John Coffey will still be executed for a crime he didn't commit. Paul offers to carelessly leave a few doors unlocked so as he can make good his escape but John Coffey, much like Jesus, agrees to go to his execution. The two villains of the piece are Wild Bill and Percy Wetmore. Wild Bill is a psychopathically evil man. Percy is childish rather than child-like. He acts like a spoiled child and enjoys bullying people who are weaker or more disadvantaged than himself. But, like a lot of people who are so inclined, he is basically a coward. He wets himself when Wild Bill, with his penchant for putting his hands through the bars of his cell and grabbing people who are within easy reach, grabs him and he wets himself with fear (maybe his surname is a reference to this). He is prepared to go to any length to kill Mr Jingles for the sheer pleasure of it. He is looking forward to his transfer to the state mental hospital and it is divine retribution by John Coffey that results in him ending up there, not as a warder but as an inmate after being an instrument in Wild Bill's come-uppance. Another instance of his sadistic nature is how he sabotages Del's execution so as it is prolonged, agonising and horrifying. One of Del's victim's relatives gleefully says, as he's being strapped into the electric chair, ""Satan's imps are a-awaitin' and the fires of hell are well-stoked"". But she, like everyone else, is horrified when she sees what happens, in fact the people watching Del's sabotaged execution are so shocked and horrified by what they see a riot breaks out and they try to force their way out the locked doors. After Del's agonising death, Percy says ""I didn't know the sponge was supposed to be wet"" and another warder punches him in anger at the way Percy is insulting the intelligence of him and the other warders. Apart from Percy, the warders are surprisingly compassionate men given the job they have to do. Maybe they believe that even convicted murderers are due an easy time during their last remaining months on this Earth. Anyway, excellent."

In this way, there was no need to be stingy with details; details which are key to the progression of the narrative.  Those who scoff at the film's length have lost interest early on!

","I was a huge fan of The Green Mile book long before the movie came out, so my expectations were rather high.  I hadn't seen The Shawshank Redemption (though it's on TV tonight so I'll most likely watch it)but since Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors, and it's my favorite book, I pretty much knew to expect a kick-ass movie.  I was not wrong.<br/><br/>The Green Mile opens with slo-mo yokels hunting for someone and then cuts to a close-up of an old man's face.  I felt that the beginning with the old Paul Edgecomb (the narrator of the story)lagged quite a bit.  It only lasted about 15 minutes, but I found myself getting restless.  However, once it went into 1935 mode, I was completely there.  The theatre my friends and I went to was only 1/2 full, but there wasn't a single dry eye in the house, no matter how adamently my ""macho"" guy friends will deny it.  Naturally, my friends would take the most inopportune time to crack a joke. Nevertheless, this is definitely my favorite movie, and I have seen a helluva lot of movies.<br/><br/>I noticed the few changes from the book and movie, which were added in for dramatic effect and really worked.  My one complaint is how there wasn't Brad Dolan, like in the book, the mean care-person of the senior's home that old-Paul is in, who is compared to Percy Wetmore, the main bad-guy in 1935.<br/><br/>
People said that this movie was cliched, and maybe it was, but it didn't stop me from enjoyng it thoroughly.  I personally, am glad that I read the book before the movie, and I suggest anybody who hasn't seen it yet does the same.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be surprised if Doug Hitchinson (who plays Percy Wetmore) or Michael Clarke Duncan (who plays the gigantic black killer/miracle on the block) got Best Supporting nods for the Oscars.

In the preview screening that I attended, there was not a dry eye in the house during several scenes, and clearly rattled many members of the audience.  Tom Hanks continues his winning streak as a death-row guard, and is wonderfully supported by the entire cast.

","I read ""The Green Mile"" in one afternoon, and was moved to tears by the end of my sitting. When I heard about the film version, I was totally ecstatic, not only because of the opportunity to see such a wonderful story onscreen, but because it stars several of my favorite actors, and is directed by Frank Darabont, director of my favorite film, ""The Shawshank >Redemption"".<br/><br/>However, I am a bit disappointed. One of the things that made ""Shawshank"" so great is the fact that it was a small film--not something you saw trailers for every 10 minutes. It was this amazing little gem, and when you find someone else who's seen it, it's like you've found a kindred spirit (not a single person I know who has seen it thought it was anything less than absolutely wonderful). However, Darabont seems to have capitalized on the lavish praise ""Shawshank"" now receives, and tried to make ""The Green Mile"" a big, important film. Its three-hour length, somewhat overdramatic acting, and numerous closeups wear on the nerves after a while. All this damages the impact of the film's message, and lessens its value as a whole.<br/><br/>I do think the film will be rewarded come Oscar time, or at least Oscar nomination time. And some of those nods are deserved, such as Thomas Newman's gloriously understated music, David Tattersall's luscious photography, and an outstanding breakthrough performance by Michael Clarke Duncan as accused murderer John Coffey. (Personally, I'd like to see Barry Pepper, Sam Rockwell, or Doug Hutchison receive Supporting nods as well!)<br/><br/>All in all, not a bad flick.

In the Green Mile, the actors chosen have given astounding performances, and will leave you chuckling one moment, and feeling your heart break the next.

"XRANDY","Null","0","0","27 January 2002"," Not ""Shawshank Part II"", much to my relief.
","Minor spoilers.<br/><br/>I was skeptical when I heard about this movie.  I thought, like I'm sure many others did, that after the achievement of `Shawshank' that the same director (Frank Darabont) was making another prison movie based on the same author as the previously mentioned work.  To put it bluntly, this had the possibility of disaster via redundancy written all over it. <br/><br/>
Of course I loved it.  Probably because its use of a prison is more of a vehicle for its apologue, than the dominant presence that it was in `Shawshank'.  The numinous aspect of the story was also enjoyable, as it never seemed to overcome the humanistic portion of the tale.  And like all non-horror King films it has a certain, wellKingesque (for the lack of a better word) quality that pervades adaptations of his works (`Stand By Me', `Hearts in Atlantis', etc).   There is a kind of quaint, yet mystical element to these film versions that always seems to transplant you into their world for the duration of the film.<br/><br/>How you ultimately feel about this movie probably comes down to how you feel about powerful manipulation in the guise of pure evil (Percy and Wild Bill) and pure good (John Coffey).  In fact Coffey is not only innocent he is a veritable saint, and inevitable martyr in a plot that is as old aswell as old as Jesus Christ.  The gray areas between the polarizing forces of morality are the rest of the prison guards and other death row inmates.  We learn much about one of the guards, Paul Edgecomb (Hanks), and a little about his co-workers, but what is significant is what we learn about two of the condemned.  Character development and themes of repentance pervade our dealings with Arlen and Del, and tug at our sympathy, while leaving almost no knowledge of their criminal acts to use in judging them.  This is probably best, because they are fictional characters, so the filmmakers can't be excused of glossing over anything heinous, and it precludes a probable mire in dichotomy, which would lengthen an already long motion picture.<br/><br/>It is always an interesting phenomenon, in my opinion, how all the dramatics, sweeping music, appealing actors, and other blandishments of the big screen can engender affinity with characters we would normally excoriate."

This all star cast of hardened veteran actors puts together one of the most impressive, emotional, and realistic performances I have ever witnessed.  Surprisingly, the most powerful performance comes from a relatively unknown Doug Hutchison, he plays the nephew of a government official that you love to hate.  And believe me, you will HATE him.

","The Green Mile By Dean Kish<br/><br/> Can a miracle happen in one of the worst places on earth? This is the very question posed by author Stephen King and director Frank Darabont. The Green Mile is set in the 1920s at the height of the Depression and where people were always looking for hope. Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb, a head prison guard assigned to the infamous `Green Mile' which is the name of that prison's death row. Its name originates from the pale green floor within the section. The inmates and the guards on the Green Mile care and at times even nurture each other. I think this is why King decided to base the story in a simpler time. Through the course of the film, Hank has to fight a bladder infection, a vicious spoiled brat guard and a giant with a heart of gold. It's through these conflicts that we see the story emerge.<br/><br/> Hank's continues his allure as one of the greatest actors of our generation but does tug hard on keeping our attention. His conflict with the vicious Percy Wetmore is over stretched and becomes a bore. Percy is tyrannical and reminded me a lot of an impression of Kevin Spacey or Tim Roth instead of an actual credible performance. To be blunt Percy's devilish nature seemed to be staged, predictable and never really frightening. I can see the reason for the character but he is so cliched it really bugged me. For me the amazing performance was in the giant, John Coffey. Michael Duncan who plays John Coffey was amazing and brilliant in his very simple role. I look forward to seeing more of him. Darabont's sweet tone and melodrama made me really yearn for a rough real prison opus like BravoTV's `OZ'. Death row is supposed to be bleak and the last refuge for the convict. But when I witnessed the execution scenes, a different view came to be. It seemed each time Hank's crew killed a man they lost a little part of their world and that kept me in my chair. Asking the question how much of their world will be lost to `Old Sparky'? They were gut-wrenching scenes. A delicate and delightful addition to the film is the world we enter when we are introduced to `Mister Jiggles', the mouse, who makes us smile every time he moves that spool. It's his addition that cleverly uncovers the miracle and the depth of love within one giant's being. A continuing debate I have around the film is the ending was it the appropriate ending? Without ruining it for the masses write me with your thoughts. Could it end another way? The Green Mile is very long especially with an accompaniment of trailers which stretch the length to 3 and a half hours. I witnessed people actually get up and leave before the final revelation even finished. As I walked out of the theatre I began to wonder if this film maybe should have been a mini-series instead of a feature. Director Darabont's previous film `The Shawshank Redemption' was another prison piece with a better message and a better length. (4 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer"

","The Green Mile is a very good movie based on Stephen King's serialized novel. I have read most of King's books and this is one of his very best. It is adapted nicely to film by Frank Darabont, the man responsible for the film version of King's story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank was a great movie too, with brilliant performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. I'm hoping Darabont will adapt more King stories.<br/><br/>The acting is the highlight of The Green Mile. Tom Hanks, one of the best actors working today, is great as Paul Edgecomb, a death row guard. David Morse, Barry Pepper and Jeffrey DeMunn all give strong performances as fellow prison guards. Doug Hutchinson (Eugene Tooms in two early X-Files episodes) as creepy guard Percy Wetmore and Sam Rockwell as sadistic killer ""Wild Bill"" both give standout performances. James Cromwell, Michael Jeter and Bonnie Hunt are good in smaller roles. Harry Dean Stanton is hilarious as a drunk janitor used in run-throughs for the executions.<br/><br/>However, the best performance is turned in by newcomer Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey. Coffey is one of the most inspiring characters I've ever seen in a movie and I hope to see more of Duncan in the future. He deserved an Oscar for his performance. This film ranks with American Beauty and The Insider as the very best films of 1999."
"EThompsonUMD","8","0","0","2 August 2000"," A mix of Hollywood sentimentality and thematic ambition.
","The Green Mile is an odd and somewhat over-long, yet fascinating, blend of Hollywood sentimentality (evil guard vs. good guards, the idiot/Christ-figure black giant, the mouse plot) and thematically ambitious, cinematographically arresting storytelling. Its metaphoric title aptly suggests the rich, ambiguous interplay of life and death imagery surrounding all the characters - not only those facing imminent electrocution in a 1930s contraption that suggests, however realistic its depiction, the instrument of torture a twisted medieval baron demonically possessed with the knowledge of electricity might wield on his worst enemy. <br/><br/>The 'green mile' of the prison death row supervised by prison guard, Paul Edgecomb (wonderfully acted by Tom Hanks), is on one level a short painted corridor whose length is measured not literally in feet, but rather figuratively, in the emotional intensity of certain, scheduled, horrifying death. Here 'greenness' functions both as a gallows humor joke and as a sign of redemption (all the inmates, even, ironically, the 'innocent' ask for forgiveness as their last earthly act). On another, more allegorical, level, the green mile is life itself, filled with love, yes, and beauty and even miraculous generosity and healing, but filled even more to the brim (the film suggests) with brutality, suffering, and loss Â– and of course culminating in an execution less ritualized but no less certain, and often no less gruesome, than the one faced by the socially condemned.<br/><br/>That the pain of living outweighs the joy is indicated, among other ways, by director Frank Darabont's choice and nearly exclusive use of institutional settings (prison, mental hospital, nursing home), by execution scenes whose prolonged horror produce existential as well as physical nausea, and by its inclusive catalog of the slings and arrows that human beings collectively must face (from the relative triviality of urinary infection to the nightmarish rape and murder of children).<br/><br/>Perhaps even more than its length, slow pace, and strange mix of realistic and supernatural modes, the most un-Hollywood element of The Green Mile is its insistence on a tragic, and rather orthodox Christian, view of life and death."

","After watching over 3 hours of The Green Mile, I turned to my friends and we all agreed - this movie was disappointing.  While it clearly was well-filmed and had some terrific performances, especially by Doug Hutchinson and Sam Rockwell, the movie lacked the emotional force to carry you through such a long movie.  For better or more likely worse, it will be compared to Shawshank and its safe to say that it never reaches that lofty perch.  I laughed once and never felt chills...it never moved me which is usually why I go to the movies in the first place.  <br/><br/>I find it interesting that, in my opinion and with few exceptions, the best adaptations of Stephen King books come from those that deal with human emotions in the real world (Shawshank, Misery, Dolores Claiborne, Stand by me, Cujo) without resorting to some odd supernatural force (see/read the end to ""It"" or ""The Stand""....terrible).  King can really build up a story and I'm willing to suspend my disbelief but when he never offers any sort of explanation, it takes away from everything that has come before it.  He's not a terrific closer and this ending once again proves it in my mind.<br/><br/>In my own personal top movies of all time, Shawshank holds the #1 spot so I really wanted to love this movie.  I just don't think the story was strong enough."

","The Green Mile has to be one of my favorite movies of '99.  The story: Tom Hanks plays a security guard who encounters John Coffey (Michael Clark Duncan), a man wrongly accused of murder and who later reveals that he has the power to heal people.  Michael Clarke Duncan is awesome as John Coffey, a giant of a man who is gentle and child-like.  He has to be my favorite character out of this movie.  Tom Hanks and all the other guards and prisoners of the Green Mile, the name given to the death row because of the lime-green floor, are also very good characters.  Pursey, a weaseley guard with a bad attitude, is one of those characters that you just love to hate. There are many other likeable characters in this movie, including a mouse which a prisoner names ""Mr. Jingles"".  This movie has some lighthearted funny moments in it.  For instance, in the night the guards try to find a mouse that has been poking around the prison. (Mr. Jingles)  ""Three grown men, outsmarted by a mouse!"" It is also very touching in parts, specifically towards the end. If you get the chance, see this movie.  In my opinion it's one of the best movies of 1999.

"BuddyBoy1961","7","0","0","12 July 2000"," By far, 1999's most moving film
","1994 saw a modest Stephen King novel translated into a modest, little-seen prison drama...that is, until it was blessed with a surprising seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. Since then, everyone and their grandfather has espoused ""The Shawshank Redemption"" as the little movie that could...and did. Five years later, its director, Frank Darabont, has adapted yet another prison-based King tale into a highly pleasing entertainment. But there the similarities end. While ""Shawshank Redemption"" essentially belied its typically macabre Kingian origins, but for a similar tone and languid pace ""The Green Mile"" includes a crucial plot element not atypical from the horror-meister's oeuvre. Told in flashback, a former death-row prison guard (solidly played by Hanks) relates the extraordinary story of John Coffey (Duncan), a simple-minded and gentle inmate who is readily accepted as a killer in the summer of 1935 because of his hulking size and damning circumstantial evidence. But Coffey (initials J.C., ahem), in addition to his overwhelmingly considerate attitude, possesses a singular talent for psychic empathy with others and an ability to heal the sick. Gradually, he convinces most of his captors, to varying degrees, that he is not a man capable of the heinous crime he is condemned to die for imminently. Compounding their crisis of conscience are the presence of a callous fellow guard and a psychotic neighboring inmate. Despite its over-length (by at least 20 minutes), the 3-hour ""Green Mile"" succeeds in every other respect. Often moving and technically astute, its premiere quality lies within its ensemble of actors, each of whom is simply perfect in their respective roles. Hanks may be the star of the show, and Duncan may stand out because of the uniqueness of his character, but their co-stars are consistently equal to the standard they've both set throughout. That alone is reason enough to see ""The Green Mile""."

Underlying themes bring up questions about the ethics of the death penalty and the American legal system, in retrospect and today; the story may make us feel that certain characters deserve to die, however these same feelings are turned on us by the inevitable outcome of the film.  This movie is filled with things that bring out emotions in everyone: disabled people, cute little animals, undeserved human suffering, and a heavy religious influence are among these traits.  Definitely one of the best films of the year."

","I agree with some of the other comments made about Stephen Kings adaptations, some work and some definately don't. This is one of those that fortunatley does, and it even makes up for some of the one's that don't. Don't mistake this for just another prison flick, or expect a rip off of the Shawshank Redemption, because this is neither. It follows the lives of prisoners and guards on a prisons death row, Hanks (Paul Edgecombe) is the head guard who tries to show a little compassion to the prisoners facing the inevitable, most of his fellow guards are of the same mind except one, who uses his position as nephew of the governor's wife to keep him in a job that enables him to induldge his bullying nature. Michael Clarke Duncan is John Coffey, who, with shades of Forrest Gump, introduces himself as John Coffey, ""like the drink only spelled different"" is a prisoner on death row for killing two girls, as the film progresses the guards come to realise they are about to send an innocent man to the chair. It has some nice moments in it, particularly with Mr Jingles, a mouse who patrols the 'Green Mile' floor and eventually makes friends with the guards and prisoners, and I have to say I haven't seen an acting performance like this from a mouse since Tom and Jerry. All the cast play their parts well, Tom Hanks and Michael Clark Duncan especially. King's story gives the film enough of a twist to make it interesting and different, but it's not so over the top with the effects and to make it nonsensical. The film wasn't quite what I expected, and was pleasantly better than I though it was going to be. It maybe a 3 hour epic but I've seen shorter films that have seemed twice as long, and I could quite happily sit through the film without getting antsy. On a par with 'Shawshank' so if you liked that chances are you'll like this as well."

And it really SHOULD have been a boring one!  After all, how much of a story can you make out of what amounts to be a more confined ""Shawshank Redemption"".  I was definitely amazed.<br/><br/>Never, during the three hours, did I wonder when it was going to end.  The acting, the scenery, the music, and some kind of intangible, unrecognizable atmosphere draws you in, and literally makes you feel as if you're there, back in the 1930's in an unairconditioned death-row.  During the three hours, you see Paul Edgecomb so profoundly affected and changed by a man who was, initially, just another rapist and murderer.  And as he explains the story to his friend, you can understand his fear and anguish, because you were there with him as he got to know John Coffey and killed him.  When the movie finishes, it's almost as if you're suddenly thrown back into your own life, wondering how you got from 1933 to the present, and wondering what will happen to Paul Edgecomb.<br/><br/>The acting was spectacular, the directing was spectacular, the music (Thomas Newman is an expert) was spectacular, and the story was, although a simple one, a very meaningful one that makes you wish it were a reality to which you could go back in time and change its outcome.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, the Oscars were a farce.  American Beauty was a more trendy, cliche ""let's-criticize-Americans"" movie.

","People would think that this film from the same director as THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, that this is another prison film.  Well, it isn't. SHAWSHANK was more about a man's search for hope.  The director, Frank Darabont, new film THE GREEN MILE, isn't about a prison, but about a miracle that happens in a prison.  This is a outstanding film that shows what a miracle that could, or we wish that could happen, and how would mankind treat it. The story is based on the Stephen King novel, where it takes place on ""E"" block of a prison in Louisiana.  The ""E"" block is the death row, also known as ""the green mile.""  On the mile, the chief of the security is Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), a sympathetic guard who cares about the health of most of his prisoners.  Paul has fellow kind and friendly guards at the mile which include, Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), and Harry Terwilleger (Jeffrey DeMunn).  There is one rotten apple in the bunch of guards, and his name is Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison).  Percy doesn't care about anybody but himself.  Percy is cruel to the inmates, and loves to taunt them. One day a new convict arrives to the ""green mile,"" a seven foot and 300 pound black man named John Coffey (Michael Duncan Clark).  Coffey (sounds like the drink, spelled different)was convicted of killing two young girls. But when Paul talks and meets Coffey, he believes that Coffey didn't kill the two young girls.  But that is only a part of the story.  There's a secret in Coffey that is a blessing or a miracle.  Whatever you call it, it's highly unusual for someone to have, and it does good towards humanity. THE GREEN MILE has ""classic"" written all over it.  This is a truly fantastic film!  Despite it's 3 hour plus running time, it's the fastest paced 3 hour film since TITANIC.  The story and character's grab your intrest, that time doesn't matter to you.  You're more concerned about the people.  That element alone is a sign of success. Frank Darabont tells a strongly dramatic film that isn't about a prison, but takes place in one.  It's a very emotional film, yet you would walk out of the film not only falling in love with it, but somewhat happy. Darabont does a excellent job of detailing the character's and their feelings and  traits.  And like SHAWSHANK, Darabont does a magnificent job on adapting the work of Stephen King.  If I was Stephen King, I would have only Frank Darabont direct the film adaptations of my stories from now on. But the acting is also worthy of picking up golden statues.  Tom Hanks is different and great as the very kind and caring prison guard.  So are his fellow guards (Morse, Pepper, and DeMunn).  James Cromwell is also excellent as the prison warden who isn't the ""stereotyped"" warden.  And Michael Jeter is quite good as the mousy prisoner Eduard Delaeriox, who's best friend is a mouse.  But two faces or actors stand out in this film.  First is Doug Hutchison, who is very cruel and creepy as the evil guard.  His character of Percy, is the type of villian that you would love to see him get punished.  And the other actor who stands out is Michael Duncan Clark.  Clark is huge, yet he's very emotional and gentle as Coffey that the audience does feel a certain kind of kinship towards him.  You care about Coffey, that you also would believe Paul that Coffey can't be a murderer. I was extremely pleased with this classic. This has Oscar for Best Picture (winning, not nomminated) all over it. It is indeed over 3 hours, yet you'll feel a lot different after watching this movie.  It's a excellent tale about miracles, that happen in the most unlikely places.  And if they do happen, don't abuse them, bless them.  THE GREEN MILE, is paved with gold!

","A deeply moving film that really makes you think about life and what it means to each of us. I sat in my chair after the movie and was burdened by the thought of what I would have done when faced with a similar fate. The 3+ hour running time didn't matter at all. The story was so gripping that even though there were a great many ""slow"" moments, the film never once bored me. An excellent movie experience. Should have won Best Picture of 1999."

","I was intensely moved by 'The Green Mile', which is as haunting as 'The Shawshank Redemption', yet far more mystical. It was not nearly as uplifting as 'Shawshank', it was very sad and violent in parts, but also had moments of humor. The acting is first-rate, particularly Michael Duncan as John Coffey, the Gentle Giant and healer on Death Row. The execution scenes are disturbing, and the film is very long. But, as with 'Shawshank', I felt haunted by the film long after I had left the theater. I see images of the film flash in my mind; I hear pieces of dialog. It's heart-breaking cinema, and even if critics are dismissing the film, Hanks and Company have nothing to be ashamed of. I highly recommend this film, but go with an open mind and open heart, and a vivid imagination and sense of hope. These are essential; without them, the message will be lost."

","Frank Darabot and Stephen King joins again after making ""Shawshank Redemption"" which was a hands down masterpiece (even though it didn't win best pic which it deserved, not FORREST GUMP!!!) but that's beside the point. Anyway...<br/><br/>First of all, great cast, of actors who all did awesome jobs. Frank Darabot seems to work magically with actors in his films.(even though he only has done two, but it's still all good) His actors never seems to be confused of what they are playing and they seem totally absorbed. Great pace of the film. I like films where it's not just cut and cut and cut and next scene. I personally like films where I have a time to just absorb what just happened and what's on the screen at the moment. The film seemed to be a little long, but I was absorbed in the film most of the time.<br/><br/>If there's a flaw I'm going to say that its flaw was in the content generally. Why am I saying this? Because I could not figure out what was necessarily a flaw in that film. It was a good film, as a matter of fact, a GREAT one. But, it could somehow have been better. Somehow. Because there are better movies than THE GREEN MILE. And if there are better movies than one movie, that means that you can somehow make it better by changing it around a little bit. How? I don't know. But you can make it SOMEHOW better. Am I saying this was just an OK movie? NO. But I'm saying that there are better movies. THAT is all I'm saying. Anyway....<br/><br/>All right, enough blabbing. Want my opinion on this movie in one sentence? It was a GREAT FILM. Go watch it. **** out of ****"

","Good movie, but a perfect example of what a good editor could do for a film. This film needed an editor -- desperately. It was WAAAAAAYYYYY too long. That aside -- the acting was superb -- in particular Michael Clarke Duncan who turns in one of those once-in-a-lifetime performances. Of course, Tom Hanks is excellent (who would've thought that Kip of Bosom Buddies would become one of the great actors of American cinema?). What also gives this movie its heft are the great supporting actors like Michael Jeter.<br/><br/>I realize this movie is meant to change one's mind about capital punishment because it is set in the South amongst the stereotypical racists and rednecks and there is a particularly horrifying execution scene that lasts too long, but it didn't change my mind for those very reasons -- Hollywood is trying too hard to foist its political views on me.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is excellent, and I would recommend it."

"Theoron","Null","0","0","24 April 2000"," King and Darabont are at it again...
","There's a wonderful line in the opening scene of the classic movie `All About Eve' given by George Sanders: `Minor awards are for such as the writer and director-since their function is merely to construct a tower so that the world can applaud a light which flashes on top of it.'<br/><br/>`The Green Mile' is one of those towers.   And what a wonderful tower it is, constructed by those two magic lantern architects Stephen King and Frank Darabont.  They were the responsible parties behind the majestic edifice of `The Shawshank Redemption.'  <br/><br/>Stephen King, the chief architect of `The Green Mile,' seems to draw unction for his greatest writing from the Bible.  One of his most popular works, `The Stand,' is nothing more than a possible explanation for the book of Revelation.  Whether you believe that the book of Revelation is a true prophecy or not, one cannot honestly deny it's incredible ability to fire the human imagination unlike any other words put to paper during the past two millennia.  <br/><br/>It is quite obvious Mr. King has once again has gone back to the Bible to gather kindling to light the fire known as `The Green Mile.'   But rather than John the Revelator's fantastic visions of future mayhem, he goes back to the beginning of the New Testament, and gathers his sticks amongst the rich woods of the four gospels.   Unlike Revelation, the four gospels are a straightforward telling of the life of Christ, as witnessed by many of his disciples.   These accounts are not meant to be, nor are they written as an allegory.   Hence, much room is left for later wordsmiths to describe the life of Jesus in more poetic terms.<br/><br/>While one may either appreciate or hate `The Green Mile' without having ever read any of the works of Matthew, Mark, Luke & John; it is a far more interesting film when one watches it with the knowledge of the gospels in the forefront of one's mind.   The gospel paradigm is almost an essential filter to distill the essence of what King and Darabont are trying to say.    <br/><br/>Though the main character is a prison guard played by Tom Hanks, the true story of this film concerns the fate of a giant black man named John Coffey, as played by Michael Clarke Duncan.   Here we have our messiah; falsely accused of a crime he did not commit, and sentenced to die for it.   Not only is he innocent, but much like Jesus himself, Coffey is blessed with the gifts of healing and prophecy.   (Careful viewers will find the Coffey character to have a demeanor very similar to Hank's Forrest Gump!)<br/><br/>But what's an allegory of the life of Christ without a Pharisee to shout `crucify him!'   Mr. King does not disappoint in this regard, but supplies several Pharisees to counter the innocence found in John Coffey.   We have a perverted prison guard, Percy Wetmore, who seems to have sadomasochistic tendencies.   (He definitely being more of a sadist)  and a prisoner named `Wild Bill' who hints at being demon possessed by choice.   Not surprisingly, these two don't care much for the big African American messiah in there midst, and choose to torment rather than learn from him.<br/><br/>One also needs disciples for a proper messianic tale, and these are supplied by the characters of the `good' prison guards, played by Tom Hanks & Co. They have wisdom enough not to judge their wards, but do there best to care for them until the final judgment of the state of Louisiana is carried out.  Having been in charge of violent men for several years, they quickly realize that John Coffey does not fit the profile of those who are routinely sent to their final resting place courtesy of `Old Sparky.'   This realization creates an unwanted dilemma, for how can one, in good conscious, put to death an innocent man for crimes he did not commit?  <br/><br/>
Themes like these are not the talk of the local coffeehouses, but are critical to our advancement as moral agents.    If nothing else, I can salute King and Darabont for pushing this issue into the forefront of our lives, that we may, if only for a few hours, contemplate the seriousness and finality of capital punishment.   Those politically inclined have proclaimed that this film to be blatant criticism of capital punishment, but I don't see it that way.   Too me, this film goes beyond that issue, and forces us to think critically about our own lives, and our own need for a Savior. <br/><br/>Frank Darabont, in his efforts to help construct this magnificent tower, shows just how much a film can impact us when a man with the proper temperament and talents is put to the task.   His direction is tight and his techniques are subtle.   He allows the story the room it needs, not cropping or chopping, as many would be tempted to do.   The pace of life in the Deep South is slow and steady, and Darabont does a marvelous job of capturing that feeling in the confines of an impatient medium.<br/><br/>Stephen King did a fine job crafting the story the film is based upon, but leaves just a few too many loose ends that would have been best trimmed before publication.   There are certain actions and scenes that just don't make sense, and though they don't majorly detract from the main story, they do detract somewhat from our understanding of the film.   It's a bit distressing when I find myself rewriting a movie in my head while I'm watching it on the screen; and I admit doing it while watching `The Green Mile.'   There were a few scenes where I found myself saying, `If only he would have said `B' instead of `A'  what impact it would have had!'   It is my belief that had the script been just a bit more polished in places, this film would have been the rightful winner of `Best Picture' instead of `American Beauty.'"

","Those who complain about the length of THE GREEN MILE should count themselves lucky that there are some film-makers around willing to put faith in their work and its value rather than fob you off with 90 minutes of the usual over-edited dross. And though I accept that there's little in the film that hasn't been done before, there's also little in it that has been done better. Although not as cohesively structured as THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE GREEN MILE is that wonderful film's equal because it explores evil and injustice in a more telling and confrontational manner. So what if all the bad characters are EXTREMELY bad? Would more morally ambiguous characters have really served the thrust of the story? One of the film's strengths is its simplicity both in story and character. A movie as touching and marvellously acted as this deserves nothing but praise."

","Its a rare experience when a film appears to have a profound impact on your emotions in a particular point in time.  The Green Mile is such a film.  It is brutal in parts, but at the base of the story is something quite different, something many people will never be able to touch or feel.  What would it be like to be able to help people, to read peoples thoughts, to know what is in their hearts?  Most of us will never know.  Everyone from technical crew, actors the director, screenwriter etc all helped to produce a very powerful film.  Its rare when a film can make you feel compassion for the convicted (even those who were actually guilty of their crimes) and hate for those in positions of authority and power.  This film is different to any I have previously seen in its combination of emotional intelligence, history and storyline.  Its thought provoking, emotionally draining and visually stunning. I would recommend it to anyone.  Only one complaint was I seriously doubt that so many contemporary varieties of four letter words were used in the depression era as vocally depicted in this film"

Tom Hanks is wonderful as always, James Cromwell and David Morse do their thing and do it as well as expected of them, and Graham Greene sets down another convincing old Indian (excuse me, Native American).

","Frank Durabont has already passed the Stephen King test, being one of the few directors to successfully adapt one of the pop-authors books into a good film with The Shawshank Redemption.  Durabont does it again with The Green Mile.  <br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb, a prison guard circa 1930's, with a heart of gold who runs the area of the prison that is death row, and affectionately called 'the green mile'.  Paul and his counterparts believe that a little kindness goes a long way in maintaining their little corner of the world, as they believe their kindness is all that these inmates have left. <br/><br/>
John Coffeey, a friendly giant played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is the latest visitor to their cell block, who has been convicted of a murder that we know right away he did not commit.  We know this because his only request is that they leave the lights on for him at night as he is afraid of the dark.  <br/><br/>One of the big complaints about this film is its running time (almost 3 hours) but I have to say that I wasn't bothered by that one bit.  In fact, I was sorry to see it end.  <br/><br/>Over the course of three hours we see several story lines evolve, mostly surrounding Hanks character and the supernatural powers that Duncan's character possesses.  We get a first hand look at capital punishment and the ordeal of facing the electric chair.  While this is a film that rallies against capital punishment, the film does not get mired in its message. <br/><br/>
Hanks does some fine acting in this role, holding back the temptation to let loose his trademark humor, maintaining a stoicism that would befit a prison guard in this situation.  <br/><br/>Duncan is even more interesting to watch.  His blubbering village idiot provides the true heart and the magic (literally) of this moving film. <br/><br/>
The Green Mile contains some horrific scenes, including a botched execution and a nasty end to a lovable rodent, but even these incidents are tamed down by the warmth that is conveyed by its main characters.  Despite the violence, I would still recommend this film for the whole family."
"Chelman666","9","0","0","24 March 2000"," A good book adaptation and a very interesting biblical allegory.
","Firstly I must say that I was quite sceptical before actually seeing this film. It enjoyed a huge hype and everyone was raving about it which generally is bad news in my opinion. I was however pleasantly surprised. On a basic level of a book adaptation the film was wonderfully true to the story and didn't detract from the suspense of the book.<br/><br/>
As we all know Stephen King adaptations are either gems or stinkers, there is no middle way. This fortunately fell into the gem category.<br/><br/>I myself am not religious but since I was brought up as a catholic it was hard to miss the biblical relevance of this film. It seemed to go a little further than the bible because it actually spells out to us what purgatory and hell are like and what heaven is supposed to be like. These are of course life and death respectively. The ones that die are the lucky ones. There is of course the obligatory element of the struggle between good and evil where satan (wild bill) is defeated by christ (john coffey). Even the initials seem to be so chosen as to make even the dimmest of viewers realise the allegorical aspect.<br/><br/>And of course the judeo-christian aspect of 'eye for an eye' is present as well in the shape of Percy Wetmore.<br/><br/>This movie not only goes a little further than the bible it also questions one of its most important 'truths', namely it states that death equals heaven unlike the traditional view that life equals heaven. For that questioning only this film becomes much more valuable.<br/><br/>I would definately recommend anyone to see it. If you've only read the book up till now do not be afraid of seeing the film and being disappointed, you won't be.<br/><br/>As to many complaints that the film is to long I would like someone to point out which scenes should be cut.... This is a movie where unlike in many 90 minute movies there are no embellishing subplots. Every single scene falls into place at one point of the movie or other. This ranges from Paul's urinary tract infection to Mr.Jingles and the cornbread baked by Mrs.Edgecomb."

I am glad you took my advice. I just saw your ""Green Mile"" and I thought it was very good. I see that you adapted it from Stephen King's story about a death row giant and his supernatural powers. I see that you once again created a bond between the black and white man in prison by having the prison guard befriend this gentle giant.

His presence was almost comforting and I didn't even know that much of the story in advance.<br/><br/>The story, except for one forgivable coincidence (it's too coincidental to my opinion that the true killer of the two girls John Coffey ('like the drink, but spelled differently') was convicted for, Wild Bill, actually was in the same prison and at the same time as John) is a true gem with some nice King edges.<br/><br/>Breathtaking, silence-making, contemplating.<br/><br/>Best movie of 1999 (and I have seen a lot, believe me).<br/><br/>9 out of 10."

","This is King's most cunning film, even better than The Shawshank Redemption. We are given no horror like silk-peeling of a kind, yet so touching a story, so well written in a very strange point of view (as King usually does). From a penitentiary guard. The film develops itself in a plot in which the suspense is going on quicker and thicker on throughout to the end. The Green Mile has won for itself for its great story nonetheless. The characters were so well acted and well maintained."

","Surprised. That's how I was feeling after seeing ""The Green Mile"". I've never expected anything from this movie, in fact, before watching, I used to think that it would be boring, exaggerated, silly, annoying, irritant, ugly and an unjustifiable nominee for the Oscar, occupying space that should be used by much better movies. Most of these ""qualities"" were deduced from the scenes that were always shown in the television: the little mouse running, the little mouse eating, the little mouse that... like the whole film was about the mouse. And more than this, by some extremely exaggerated ones, where the 2 meters Michael Clarke Duncan asked Tom Hanks to leave the lights on in the night. <br/><br/>I knew that the movie wouldn't be so stupid, of course. It was nominated for the Oscar for some good reason. So, I wanted to take a look at it. After watching ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", ""The Cider House Rules"", ""American Beauty"" and ""Being John Malkovich"", it was ""The Green Mile"" time. I went to the cheaper theater in my town and... surprise! After less than 30 minutes I was completely interested and excited. <br/><br/>Although the mouse really appeared a lot in story, it wasn't as irritant as I thought it would be. In fact, the little mouse was very important in some of the main and most emotional scenes. The movie would be worse without it. I thought Michael Clarke Duncan was good in his role but not amazing. Tom Hanks was. The cinematography was beautiful and the execution scenes were remarkable. And the three hours and eight minutes passed very fast.<br/><br/>
I still think that ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Magnolia"", ""Being John Malkovich"", ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and even ""Election"" deserved the Best Picture nomination (much) more than ""The Green Mile"". But now, at least, I'm not so indignant. ""The Green Mile"" has its qualities, and these aren't a few. 9/10"
"danielll_rs","6","0","0","11 March 2000"," A very good film, but doesn't quite deserve the nomination for best picture
","Now that I've seen all the five nominees for this year's Oscar as best picture, I can say what I think of each of them-- ""American Beauty"": simply the best film ever made. If you have read some of my comments, you now that (10/10)-- ""The Cider House Rules"": a wonderful, warm story, beautifully acted and directed (9/10)-- ""The Insider"": a very well made drama, discussing important subjects, as ethics, and showing the power of the press in our days (9/10)-- ""The Sixth Sense"": an excellent supernatural drama with amazing surprises, specially in the end (10/10)-- And ""The Green Mile""... Well, it's the 'worst' in the category. I put the word worst between inverted commas because it doesn't mean that it is a bad film. Just the opposite- it's a very good one. <br/><br/>The film begins with an old man telling to a friend of his a story by flashbacks. The story is about his life while he was a chief guard in the 'green mile' of a prison, where criminals wait to be executed. Everything changes when John Coffey, a tall black man, accused of the murder of two little girls, arrives in the prison. I won't tell many details of the plot, but some amazing, supernatural things happen, changing the lives of the guards and the prisoners.<br/><br/>""The Green Mile"" is based on a Stephen King novel, and is very well adapted by Frank Darabont, who also makes a great direction job. The acting is another high point of the film. Tom Hanks gives a good performance, and Michael Clarke Duncan surprises us. He deserves his nomination for best supporting actor, but I don't think he deserves to win.<br/><br/>
""The Green Mile"" has also its flaws. There are many impacting scenes, specially the ones where people die in the electric chair. However, the end, which could have also been impacting, is confusing and weird. Another part I didn't like was when Coffey cures Melinda, the lady with cancer. It looks like an ""Exorcist 4"". And more- that was predictable. <br/><br/>Taking these defects, the film really works. It is not another ""Shawshank Redemption"", or something better than ""American Beauty"" or ""Being John Malkovich"", but it is a worth seeing. And take your time to discuss some details, as the initials of Michael Clarke Duncan's character (J.C.).<br/><br/>

","You either love ""The Green Mile"" or find it a great disappointment. There seems little middle ground . Altho the acting was high quality, the story line does not really provide an opportunity for any character to demonstrate unforgettable mastery of a memorable role.The critics generally favor Duncan for the acting ""tour de force"". I cannot because I was unable to understand more than a few words he uttered. (my own hearing disability) There is more widespread agreement that this picture is too long by at least an hour. Vigorously agree. My major criticism of this movie is that it could not make up its mind whether it wanted to be realistic or surrealistic. Logic, humanity,gratitude and compassion demanded that John Coffey's execution be postponed pending re-examination of his purported guilt. It completely destroys credulity  when the Warden stands by to witness Coffey'execution(Coffey merely saved his wife's life) and Eberton(Hanks) actually conducts the horrible miscarriage of justice."

Of course I didn't cry FOR Hanks in this movie, rather WITH him (and every single person in the cinema with me). Some movies you miss a line here and there because of opening chip packets or chatter between bored viewers being overheard. With ""The Green Mile"" you miss lines from nose blowing, breath catching mid cry and sniffling back the runny nose and tears.<br/><br/>I LOVED this movie and what it said ------ it didn't hit you over the head with its spirituality either which i liked. I am appalled by the evangelistic style ""Events"" that are staged by so-called faith healers today, trying to get you to join their one true church of god to be healed (credit cards accepted of course)and pushing their own agenda before you get ""healed"" which of course you don't.  No, John COFFEY truly was a spiritual man, one who's spirit was powerful and therefore didn't need to preach in order to share his soul with others.<br/><br/>That's what I feel spirituality is ...... not organised religion or churches, rather it is the honest love between one another of people. When Coffey said ""it's the same all over the world, they kill them with their love!"" I understood! I hope we all can understand one day and stop man's inhumanity to man.<br/><br/>The best film I have ever seen!   10/10<br/><br/>PS to Haley Joel OSMET, sorry kid, you'll be crying too soon!

","The Green Mile(1999) was one of the best films of last year and should be awarded with several Oscars.  Michael Clarke Duncan carries the film as he projects a man who is gentle, misunderstood, and slow-minded.  In fact, his performance is an inspiration to the rest of the cast as they seem to feed off it.  It did a good job at showing the racial hatred and how it affects justice.  The Green Mile is similar to Of Mice and Men because that also involves a slow-witted, misunderstood, gentle person.

","I'm as big a fan of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" as you'll find.  So, as I did with ""Shawshank"", I saw this on opening day.  I have to admit I was a little worried about the 3 hour plus running time.  But let me say this was never boring, and never really felt too long (except for a few scenes).  Honestly, it sailed much more than the other 3 hour film I saw today, ""Magnolia.""<br/><br/>The reason for the length is the dedication to the book.  Almost nothing has been left out.  The only major changes were made to the present day material, which bookends the film here.  It takes about 2 hours and 50 minutes to tell this story.  I'd say it could have been trimmed by maybe 10 minutes.  Some members of the audience were restless, but they appeared to me to be guys better off watching ""Armageddon"", so the hell with them.<br/><br/>On the plus side:the cast.  It's one of the year's best.  A bunch of great character actors, old and young.  And Hanks does give one of his best performances.  The Duncan guy playing John Coffey is dead-on:it's as if the book was written with him in mind.  The production design is top notch.<br/><br/>On the minus side:I would have rather seen Roger Deakins back.  The photography is good, just not as crisp as ""Shawshank.""  Thomas Newman's score is good, but a little ""Shawshank"" redux.  The closing segment underlines what we already know, or feel.  The old Paul Edgecomb didn't have to spell everything out.<br/><br/>One thing:the LA Times critic here (the same guy who dissed ""Titantic"") threw a hissy fit over Del's execution scene.  The way he described it, you would think it was a Fangoria Splatterfest.  I found the scene tastefully done (in the context of what happens in the book) and honest-to-gosh restrained.  But that's my two cents."

","I did not expect to enjoy this film as much as I did. You may be surprised too. The fact that it is over three hours in length should not put you off. It's highly watchable. The characterisation is very strong. On an emotional level you connect directly with most of the characters. You want them to succeed in the task that is laid out before them. This is where the length of the film becomes advantageous. All the actors are well cast although Tom Hanks seems to be on 'auto pilot', he's in a role you'd expect him to perform well in. Michael Clarke Duncan is superb as the prisoner facing his last days on earth, reflected in his recent and well deserved Oscar nomination. The supernatural turn which we encounter half way through the film turns what could be an average prison drama into a tale of good against evil. What do you expect? It's a Stephen King story. Remember 'The Shining'? Something similar occurs there. The direction is comendable. The interest is retained despite most of the film being set in the same small prison corridor. This is why the characterisation needs to be so strong. It's an interesting, heart warming film which you'll be glad you saw, despite its length.

Georgia decision in 1972.  <br/><br/>The portrayal of Coffee by Michael Clarke Duncan shows that one could have the power to heal, and his portrayal of a death row inmate is similar to the character of Tom Robinson in To Kill A Mockingbird, where the similar circumstances of an African American male tried through the courts ended with a guilty verdict, and a death sentence handed down by the judge.

","So what we have here is a movie set in a prison in the 1930s involving a group of death-row guards, a childlike supposed child-killer who wants the light left on at night, and a tiny mouse. No, it's not ""Stuart Little"" for the taxpaying set, it's the latest movie adapted from a Stephen King story. Specifically, ""The Green Mile"" comes from the only King story so far to be presented to the public in serial form; that is, one chapter at a time was published in separate short books.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is Paul Edgecomb, the leader of the guards, already a hardened veteran of the block. His kingdom is The Green Mile, the death-row area of the prison, so named because of the color of the tile that the prisoners must walk on their way to the electric chair. One of Paul's newest prisoners is a massive black man named John Coffey, who seems completely out of place except for his size; Paul immediately senses no violence in the man.<br/><br/>The mouse is the pet of the Mile and spends most of his time in the company of one of the block's senior prisoners, Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter). The mouse himself isn't completely relevant to the plot, but his presence does serve to humanize the prisoners and to act as a bookend for the entire story, told in flashback by Paul many years later. There are many subplots, all of them surrounding Paul and his crew as they deal with John Coffey and the other prisoners, but none of them seems incongruous, and that's a major asset to a film like this. Running three hours, it's easy to mix in multiple plot lines, of course, but you don't want your audience falling asleep on you. Frank Darabont, who helmed that other Stephen King prison story (""The Shawshank Redemption""), does an extraordinary job selecting just the right camera angles and keeping the pace of the film consistent. This, along with ""Shawshank,"" is a rare bird: a film adapted from a Stephen King story that actually works well on the screen. Most of the King adaptations out there - and there have been a LOT! - have been lackluster and lacking. King's greatest quality as a writer is his exposition and character development, and most films don't have the time or patience to carry that quality over. Both of Darabont's do. <br/><br/>As for the cast, there are no slackers. Hanks is gritty and convincing in the lead, and his fine support includes David Morse as a fellow guard and James Cromwell as the prison's warden. All acquit themselves wonderfully, allowing the viewer to be drawn into the story effortlessly."

I have not been so absorbed into a long film like this, nor was I so profoundly affected by it.  The film is based on the book(or books) by Stephen King, yet to my understanding, it had a totally different emphasis of the story(aka. Book:horror story; Film:drama)  The film deals with miracles and believing in them, and above all, how each and every one of us walks our own path in life and have our own miracles and things to be proud of in life.  We all walk our own Green Miles.  Every aspect of the film is superb, from the acting, the lighting, special effects, and the direction by Frank Darabont(Stephen King's ""The Shawshank Redemption"".  The film was also very funny at times, particularly the scene where the new prisoner chews up tobacco into a huge mush mess, and spits it all out on the prison guard.

","First of all... I really liked it. Tom Hanks' latest film is just another prime example of how he has developed into a tremendous actor. While we may have enjoyed his previous films Splash, Turner & Hooch, Dragnet, Money Pit and the ever not-so-popular Joe and the Volcano, they are not of the same caliber as Philadelphia, Forrest Gump, Private Ryan, and now The Green Mile. The Green Mile is a flashback story of a prison guard who supervised a ""death row."" His flashback story touches on the uniquely personal yet strange relationships that develop between the guards and death row inmates. The depression setting era adds to the true brutality and horror of the death sentence... not in an effort to dissuade a person from supporting the death penalty, but rather show the ""executions"" from both a revenge or retaliation perspective and also from a brutal and possibly unjust perspective.<br/><br/>The Green Mile is named after the long green corridor between the cells. Tom Hanks, as head guard Paul Edgecomb, shares his memories of the inmates who resided along the green mile. One inmate in particular is John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, convicted of murdering two young girls. Hanks and the other guards (who are all excellently portrayed in this film) witness a few ""miracles"" along the green mile and struggle with Coffey's role in these ""miracles.""<br/><br/>The film is almost three hours in length, but to remove even a minute would do this film an injustice. This film is based upon a Stephen King novel, but if you are not too hyped on his work, you will be pleasantly surprised at how ""mellow"" this film adaption is compared to some of his others. The way these memories of death row inmates are shared is very personal and the audience member is drawn into a brief understanding of how it must feel to be a guard for death row. While an audience member might start to warm up to an inmate, you are quickly reminded of the reason for their incarceration.<br/><br/>Bottom line... while you may find The Green Mile a bit long (as most miles seem to be), I promise that you will enjoy each and every step along the way."

","""The Green Mile"" is the kind of film that oozes with confidence that it is going to win a slew of awards, where some scenes look like they were made so the Academy would play them as a clip while announcing the nominees. Some people have been blown away by it, while others have brushed it off as a self-important piece of rubbish. My feelings fall somewhere in the middle. I think ""The Green Mile"" is a likeable film, but not exactly worthy of getting a ""Best Picture"" nod. The main thing that makes this film strong is it's collection of exceptional performances. Tom Hanks delivers the goods (surprise, surprise) in almost every scene, while the lesser known actors that surround him also shine. I was especially moved by the actors who played Dell and John, both give sincere performances that are truly Oscar worth. The story definitely sounds shmaltzy when you here about it second-hand, but the director does a pretty decent job with. It's a simple tale of a couple of prison guard's discovery of a miracle, ultimately making them reassess their own emotional lives. What I didn't like about the plot was that it too long and became redundant at times, and some of the character's aren't handled very well. There was a bit of sporadic immaturity in the lead characters, they sometimes acted like schoolboys instead of grown men. Percy and Wild Bill weren't explored enough, and both got their ""just deserts"" too harshly and easily. The supernatural aspect of the story was made well with emotional intensity, as well as a surprisingly low amount of cheesiness, some moments were actually quite powerful and moving, especially towards the end.

If he doesn't get an academy award nomination for his part in this film, then the whole system must be ""fixed"". I ditto the above for:<br/><br/>Michael Duncan- - as John Coffey. Michael Jeter--Eduard Delacroix Doug Hutchison--Percy Wetmore<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Gary Sinese were both outstanding.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is so youthful appearing that Bonnie Hunt looked as if she were Tom's mother rather than wife. Overall, I found the film very depressing but fast-paced with very tender  moments. One could literally feel the pain of those who suffered.<br/><br/>this film is personally rated    8.3"
"cbenavidez","Null","0","0","5 February 2000"," Tom Hanks and Michael Duncan were inspiring.
","This movie will tug at every heart string you might have.  It makes you look at life in a different perspective.  It also focuses on the reality of death.  It then adds a little magic to it all.  The characters, in this movie, will make you feel the pain and joy that they are portraying.  I don't know how many Academy Awards Tom Hanks can get, but he is definitely bound for another one.  This is not to mention, the flawless performance by Michael (Big Mike) Duncan.  This movie is a must see.  If you think this is just another fly-by-night movie, your dead wrong."
"poem","8","0","0","4 February 2000"," Nice little movie with many acting giants
","Tom Hanks was the main character in my absolute favorite of the 90's - ""Forrest Gump"". This is his new movie. But - a killer with healing abilities ? Sounds really idiotic, doesn't it ? On the other hand, reading the list of fabulous actors which are in it might change one's opinion before watching it, and the movie itself has some really seldom qualities which makes it very, very enjoyable.<br/><br/>The acting here is simply marvelous. It is emotionally correct. It clearly demonstrates Mr. Hanks' (and many others!) abilities to transport emotions onto the screen. It was very nice to notice these little details - how he talked without words with his friend, how he acted in the different situations. In fact, he doesn't express feelings very often, but he really knows how to make you feel what his character feels. On the other hand, the script is often also very funny, often the people in the cinema laughed long and loud.<br/><br/>Well there is not only light. The healing scenes are simply bad, just like the basic script idea. The reasons why the healer got sentenced to death were unrealistic. In fact, some little logical holes were really obvious.<br/><br/>And the evil characters in this script - damned, they were played so excellently that I really couldn't stand them at all. Well this is not really a disadvantage, but I prefer movies with less brutal people in it.<br/><br/>This movie would not have received much praise without the names of Mr. Hanks and the well-known author of the original book. Its design is too ""little"". Excellent actors alone have never been enough for a movie to succeed. But in this case, I think the name Hanks will be enough, and I think this movie will be nominated for the Oscar."
"boberck","Null","0","0","30 January 2000"," Simple and cliche...but overwhelmingly powerful
","I went to Green Mile prepared to be cynical.  Instead, I left in awe.  The reason is simple: I have a weakness for Twilight-Zone-type morality plays which invoke myth and simple sentimentality.  The plot is not original; a character performs a few supernatural feats of healing, complete with bursting light bulbs.  What sets Green Mile apart is that enormous competence of production, acting, directing, and music.  TGM is not meant to be a serious look at any social issue.  The main setting in a prison in the early part of the 20th century is mere window dressing.  The magical character is a huge black man.  Again, that is mere window dressing.  In fact, all the characters are stereotypes, practically archetypes, and we all know who is good and who is bad.  But the movie is so strong, it pulls the strings so effectively, it crafts almost every scene with such perfection, that it simply steamrolls its way over these objections and one is left mesmerized at the end.  I expect that serious film critics will find the plot much too cliche for their tastes.  But us novice critics are in awe of this example of the power of movie making.   And I expect the normal movie-going public will be swept off its feet."

","Two weeks ago, we had a free screening of this movie here at URI.  I went into it knowing absolutely nothing about the book and the movie.  I was blown away!  After it was over, I was stunned to realize that it had been 3 hours long.  I was so enthralled with the movie that I didn't even look at my watch once.  I don't have enough time or space to fully describe the incredible event that this movie is or the spectrum of emotions that this movie will invoke.  Let me just say that any movie that can bring an entire lecture hall full of college students, half of who are drunk, to tears must be incredibly powerful.

","The book was good, but not great. The movie was great. Never before have I seen a movie so closely follow the book's storyline. Every scene from the book is included in here, and the director takes very little artistic additions. For those people who couldn't stand the movie, what were you thinking? A children's story with violent content? If you are referring to the mouse, then you obviously haven't read the book. People who read the book will love the movie, mainly because it is almost identical, but the movie is even better in the book because it is filled with wit and humor to make the three hours seem like nothing. This isn't a normal Stephen King type story, so maybe that's why there have been a few complaints."

","If Michael Duncan Clark doesn't win the Oscar for his portrayal of the gentle giant and they give it to Tom Cruise who can't act his way out of a paper bag, I'm tearing up my SAG card.  Tom Hanks once again proves himself the consummate actor with the utmost understatement in this role of a prison guard with compassion for the inmates doomed to die in his block.<br/><br/>The combo of Stephen King and Frank Darabont is a match made in movie heaven, this being their second collaboration after Shawshank Redemption...another doozy of a film, rich in characters and storylines."
"Chuck-149","8","0","0","20 January 2000"," Inferior to ""The Shawshank redemption""
","""The Green Mile"" will have excellent chances at the Oscars because ""Th Shawshank redemption"" was over-looked at the Oscars in 1994.  But it isn't as good as ""The Shawshank redemption"" probably because it isn't realistic at all.  However, the acting level can be compared because Morgan Freeman and Tom Hanks are both very good actors.  As for the directing, I think Darabont did a better job with ""The Shawshank redemption"" than with ""The Green Mile"". ""The Green Mile"" is a very good movie however and deserves to make it to the Oscars and in many categories.<br/><br/>  Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) works on death row at the local prison.  Death row at his prison is called the green mile because the floor on which the men walk going towards the execution room is green.  Paul has a bad urinal infection that year.  But aside from that everything is fine.  Also, since the men who are going to be executed there are practically as many as the guards, well the guards have befriended them.  But one day, John Coffee (Michael Clarke Duncan) is sent to the green mile.  This man looks like he could kill a man by blowing him over.  He is even bigger than one of the guards named Brutus (David Morse).  But once he is locked up, routine-life on the green mile starts again.<br/><br/>  One day however, while everyone is minding their own business, John calls Paul and asks him to grab his hand.  As soon as Paul grabs John's hand, John pulls him toward his cell and after a few seconds, he lets Paul go.  Paul instantly goes to the bathroom and realizes his urinal infection has gone away.  That was John's biggest secret.  The man is able to make miracles and soon starts  changing many things on the green mile.<br/><br/>  All the guards deliver great performances and Michael Clarke Duncan walks away with the movie.  I'm sure you'll be seeing him in the nomination list for best-supporting actor at the Oscars.  As for the movie itself, I think I found it inferior to ""The Shawshank redemption"" especially because it wasn't that realistic and Michael Clarke Duncan had a Jesus-like personality performing miracles and saving people's lives but he still delivers a terrific performance.  As for Frank Darabont, well chances are you'll be seeing his name in the best director nomination list if not this year's winner."

"slsmith2","Null","0","0","18 January 2000"," Movie follows book extremely well
","I was very excited to see this movie for more than one reason.  First of all, when I heard that it was directed by the same person who directed Shawshank Redemption (which I LOVED), I immediately knew that it would be amazing.  Also, anything written by Stephen King (as Shawshank Redemption also was) is bound to be good.  I had also bought the book when it first came out in serial form.  So the first thing I did when I went home for winter break was to read the entire book.  I was desperate to see the movie, but I was determined to read the book first.<br/><br/>The novel was extremely moving; I cried through probably half of the last book, and the movie followed very closely to the novel.  Never before have I cared so much about a mouse.  King creates a compassion in his audience for Delacroix and Coffey that would not be expected.  They are both convicted murderers on death row, yet I found myself feeling sorry for them and not wanting them to die.<br/><br/>Percy was easily unlikable, as was Wharton.  At times I wanted to jump into the screen and punch Percy myself.  On the other hand, I really liked the character of Brutal.  Although he seems to be tough, he's a very sweet guy. Each character transferred extremely well from novel to screen, which sometimes can be difficult to accomplish.  The written word allows for character description and explanation much more easily than film.<br/><br/>As always, Tom Hanks gives an outstanding performance, and Michael Clarke Duncan is amazing as John Coffey.  He portrays the depth of his character extremely well and proves that he can handle any type of role.  From the wild and crazy Bear in Armageddon to the powerful and subdued Coffey in The Green Mile, Duncan has secured his place in Hollywood alongside other notable actors for years to come."
"Kilroy-17","Null","0","0","17 January 2000"," Three hours? Didn't seem like it.
","The Green Mile was a movie that I really enjoyed.  It had the flavor of the Shawshank Redemption in its general tone and in the music, but the movies aren't similar at all.<br/><br/>I could talk about the film, but nothing I'd say about it would be original here.  I'm the 303rd reviewer of it here at IMDb and I'm sure I won't be the last.<br/><br/>But looking at some of the other comments makes me wonder what the hell people are thinking about when the lights go down.  I can understand the talk about the length of the film, but one person said that he didn't like being force-fed someone else's ideas about religion.  While no one could miss the parallel this film has to the life of Christ, why would you think that religion was being forced upon you?  Did someone drag you to a theatre and make you stay for the entire 3 hours?<br/><br/>Another person was irritated that the movie didn't address the morality of capital punishment.  The film was not even remotely about whether capital punishment is right or wrong.  To its credit, it doesn't even hint at the morality of it.  You simply accept that you're on death row and that there are executions.<br/><br/>And still another was mad that the death-row inmates were not all portrayed as evil people.  Another thought that it should have been less of a fable. One person even complained that the bladder infection that Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) had was a stupid sub-plot!  They must have been on their cellular phone for the first hour or something.<br/><br/>Why can't a movie just be a movie?  Nothing more, nothing less.  Just go in, watch it, and be entertained or not.  Don't worry about where the idea for the story came from.  Don't worry that some issue wasn't explored in a way you thought it should be unless of course that exploration would be plot critical.  Some people seemed to be obsessed with punching holes in films instead of trying to enjoy them.  Doing that is missing the point of every movie which is simply to entertain.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, the Green Mile?  Very well done.  Excellent performances all around.  I especially liked Doug Hutchinson as Percy Wetmore (that's funny since he wet his peed himself).  We've all known a little toilet bug like Percy.  A must see..."
"kiley_taylor","10","0","0","8 December 1999"," Oscar to walk The Green Mile
","I was fortunate enough to go see a screening of The Green Mile starring Tom Hanks last night.  Having read the book(s), I was expecting a bit of a let down in the movie.  For the first time in my life, however, I saw a movie that made me wish that I had not read the book before viewing.  Not that the book(s) was not great, but the movie and its performances were phenomenal. There are a great number of highly anticipated films coming out between now and Christmas, but I can confidently say that this movie will no doubt get a nomination for Best Picture.  Knowing that the award is generally pre-disposed to the whims of Academy members, I will not say it will win Best Picture, though it probably should.  Tom Hanks will be up against some very stiff competition for Best Actor ( Kevin Spacey, Jim Carrey, Tom Cruise, etc.), but he should be nominated for Best Actor again.  He probably won't win because he has two Best Actor awards already.  That said, if Michael Duncan (the big black guy who played Bear in Armageddon) doesn't win Best Supporting Actor then I may never go see another movie.  He is incredible. There are also great performances from David Morse, James Cromwell, Sam Rockwell, and Barry Pepper (Jackson from Saving Private Ryan). The Movie will also probably win Best Adapted Screenplay because it takes over 600 pages of highly detailed written material and doesn't miss anything important.  I highly recommend this movie.  Its 3 hrs and 5 minutes long, but its worth every minute.  As always with Stephen King type adaptations, pay attention to everything, because everything matters.  I hate to say that movies are in my personal Top 10 without seeing them 5 to 50 times, but The Green Mile certainly appears to be headed toward this prestigious title, and Hanks has solidified his position as the best actor of our generation."

Though the film clocks in at an epic 3:08, I never once looked at my watch. I was thoroughly engrossed and spellbound by the hypnotic visuals and the completely on-target performances. These were the people I pictured in the book. Extra consideration (especially by the Academy) should be given to Michael Clarke Duncan and Doug Hutchinson, who bring the sweet innocence of John Coffey and the maniacal sadism of Percy Wetmore to life. This year's Best Supporting Actor race is going to be tough, with these two thrown into the ring together to compete against the brilliance of Haley Joel Osment from ""The Sixth Sense.""

GREEN MILE, amazingly enough, combines elements of all of those films, books, and ideas.<br/><br/>What we have here is an entertaining but completely contrived parable with an obvious Christ-figure (another character in movies or literature with the initials J.C.) and his chief preacher of the ""word"" named Paul whom he met, not on the Road to Damascus, but on the ""green mile.""<br/><br/>The only thing that makes this unbelievable potboiler work is the excellent cast.

Every Shawshank fan will always remember the ending when Red meets Andy beside the sea as the music transits from 'So was Red' to 'End Title'.<br/><br/>'The Green Mile' brings me back to that wonderful feeling. Just this time it is a warm mixed with sad feeling. Some of my friends complain that they don't like movies that bring them such depressed feeling.

","King can tell a story and The Green Mile is a good story. If you can suspend disbelief about the unflagging civility, kindness and insightfulness of the 1932 southern prison guards, the movie works well. It is about 90% the same as the book. It lacks the energy, edge and clarity of The Shawshank Redemption, but so do most prison movies. It is at least 30 minutes longer than it needed to be, but it holds your attention. Worth seeing."

","The Green Mile: Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is in charge of death row at Louisiana's Cold Mountain Penitentiary in the 1930's.  Despite the nature of the job, he takes great pains to make life comfortable for the inmates he must eventually shepherd to the Grim Reaper.   Edgecomb's life is changed forever when he meets John Coffey (Michael Duncan), a gentle giant with a unique gift who may have been wrongly convicted. Unlike ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and some other super hyped movies this year, the promotion machine for Mile has been running on idle - unless you're a movie fan or you read the book you probably haven't even heard of it until this past week.  Brought to the screen by the duo responsible for Shawshank Redemption (author Stephen King and director Frank Darabont) I expected nothing less than excellence.  I was not disappointed. <br/><br/>
On it's most basic level, The Green Mile could be described as a study of good vs evil or a debate over the pros / cons of capital punishment but such a simple analysis does the film a disservice. A tightly written story it interweaves humor, horror, mystery, mysticism, and drama.  At three hours long however, it might not appeal to the casual moviegoer.<br/><br/>
The casting is superb and the actors mesh well, an important consideration given the set's confined spaces (according to Hanks, the area they had to work in was no larger than 100 square feet).  I would love to discuss the performances of the entire cast- Hanks, Barry Pepper, Michael Jeter, etc - but two actors in particular stand out: Duncan whose combined physical presence and surprising acting skills make Coffey believable (rumor has it that at one point Shaquille O'Neal was considered for the role - all I can say is thank heaven for small miracles) and Doug Hutchinson as Percy the sadistic prison guard - arguably the most evil character since Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.   Without these two actors, the film simply would not have gelled as well as is does. <br/><br/>If the recent deluge of cinematic drivel has left you feeling that Hollywood has forgotten the art of film making, this movie will change your mind."

Themes of kindness versus cruelty reminded me of Sling Blade (also another central, misunderstood character), but with important differences, like the narrative frame at the beginning/end (the only slightly weak acting) that reminds us of how we have a limited amount of time to make a difference.

Wasn't the joy of seeing his wife healed enough for him to do everything within his power to see John freed?!?  But,then again, were these things pursued, it would have been a different movie.

A dim, dark and hopeless atmosphere. In comes Michael Clarke Duncan(Armageddon) and suddenly good things start to happen before the inevitable executions. One of the best Stephen King movies.

"Lonnie-3","8","0","0","23 December 1999"," Enjoyable, if a bit overlong and problematic
","First, let me say that I am an enormous fan of Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" and believe it to be in the Top Ten films of the decade.  So, I went into ""The Green Mile"" with very high expectations. I was both not disappointed and reserved in my praise.  The film does so many things right that it's hard to knock from any angle.  The performances, especially by Hanks and Duncan, are stirring and near-perfect.  The production values are flawless. And Darabont's direction is, once more, exactly in tune with his material.  That's all the good stuff. As for the bad, I have two major complaints.  The first one falls on the shoulders of Darabont.  He simply has to learn how to move his stories along at a quicker pace.  There are very, very few stories out there that require 3 hours to tell in a movie, and this isn't one of them.  The pace is so deliberate at times that it weighs down the emotion - it would be more stark, honest and moving if it had more of a sense of pace.  The movie does, after all, deal with the imminant nature of all of these character's deaths, which would be more easily understood if the audience felt that they were snuffed out too quickly, rather than overstaying their welcome (as I felt Michael Jeter's Dell did). My next complaint is with King's story, and what I feel is the inherent racism in the story of John Coffey.  Having the only black character in the movie be both semi-retarded and magical plays upon ancient misconceptions about blacks in America, especially in the South.  As they do with many foreign cultures they don't understand, Americans have placed black people in the category of ""other,"" seeing them as exotic, mystical and ethereal. There is nothing patently offensive in this, but it's an oversimplification and, frankly, it's just uninteresting. These are just my thoughts.  Other than this small, rather nit-picky criticisms, I'd say ""Green Mile"" is one of the better films in a fantastic year of cinema.<br/><br/>Lonnie"

","The team which produced ""Shawshank Redemption"" has achieved the difficult task of topping its earlier effort.

They are excellent in their pivotal roles.  But it is the supporting cast that makes this movie work.  James Cromwell is believable and pitiable as a grieving husband.  Kudos should also go to David Morse(""Brutal"" Howell)and Michael Jeter (Eduard Delacroix).  Gary Sinise and Harry Dean Stanton both give jewel-like performances in tiny parts. Thomas Newman (score) and David Tattersall (cinematography) should both contend for awards for their work. <br/><br/>     This movie has been criticized as overly sentimental and obvious.  It is neither.  It IS emotional--as life and death subjects should be.  But what some viewers have labeled as obvious is the film's faithful portrayal of the grinding inevitability of the death machine--even when its target is an innocent man.<br/><br/>     Like ""Dead Man Walking"", this film will cause death penalty supporters(like me) genuine discomfort.

I usually trust Roger Ebert and was therefore willing to give Darabont another try thanks to his positive review.  I'm very glad that I did.  The acting is incredible all around.  Micheal Duncan and Micheal Jeter stood out particularly.  I am not usually a great Tom Hanks advocate and consider him generally overrated, but I thought he did a fine job of carrying the lead role in this film. The movie is slowly paced, as was the serial novel by Stephen King, and takes its' time developing characters and events.  We really feel the breadth and scope of the tale.  It feels important and monumental as it is being watched.  The photography (as in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION)is top notch.  The incorporation of TOP HAT (which I don't recall being used in the novel) in several scenes moved me to tears.  I have seen well over 2,000 films in my life and less than ten have made me cry (that would make a good topic for a conversation thread). The antagonist from th e nursing home which existed in King's novel was wisely removed.  I found that subplot distracting when I read it.  On the converse, I felt that the most powerful moment in the novel was the heart-wrenching death of the Hanks character's wife.  I was disappointed that this was also excised for the film.  My only real complaints (why I give this a 9 instead of a 10) is the gratuitous use of computer generated effects.  They did not coincide with the look, tempo or ambience of the film.  Particularly the glowing lights, incessantly exploding light bulbs (yes I know, these were NOT computer generated) and the black swarm of insects that Coffey expels from his mouth. I realize that this is how it was described in the book as well, and I did not buy it then either.  These scenes would have been more powerful if done on the low key.  Is it a classic?

This set-up creates a bond between the characters and the audience unlike any experienced in any other movie to date.  The performances were absolutely outstanding. Surprisingly, the performance noteworthy performance of Tom Hanks is overshadowed by the outstanding performances of three unknown actors: Michael Duncan, Michael Jeter, and Doug Hutchinson.  All three of these actors deserve academy awards for their performances, but it's a shame that only one can win it.  Michael Duncan has already received his share of praise, but it seems as if Doug Hutchinson and Michael Jeter have not gotten their piece of the pie.  Doug Hutchinson delivers an outstanding performance as a snotty prison guard that you love to hate.  By the end of the movie, you'll want to see him walking down the green mile.

","Another 1999 movie that combines several different genres--human drama, suspense, occasional comedy--and takes its viewers on an emotional rollercoaster.  You really have to be a machine not to feel something after watching it.  This one goes a step further and introduces another genre--sci fi/fantasy--into the plot.  After all, it's based on a Stephen King story. The film is being compared to Shawshank Redemption by everyone, but that film was more romantic in its handling of the characters and the events.  Do hardened prisoners really get that captivated by an opera?  Green Mile is more hard-edged and realistic, especially in the end.  The irony is that the film has so many fantastic elements....think of John Travolta in Phenomenon. My only complaint is the ending.  Without giving away too much plot, I think the fate of one of main characters could have been handled differently.  Tom Hanks and James Cromwell's character could have intervened, since they saw the ""miracles"" right in front of their eyes.  A retrial could have been arranged.  Then I guess we would've had a 4 hour movie instead of a 3 hour one.  Still an excellent film, and the first movie to generate so many emotions from an unlikely source--a mouse!"

The acting of veteran Dabbs Greer and David Morse was well casted in their roles and their performances were magnificent. There were great performances by the remaining cast. I must say that even the limited amount of screen time with Gary Sinise he controls the scene and is always compelling. Everyone loves Bonnie Hunt, anyway. (that's a compliment). I am anxious to see the lesser known actors in more roles in other films. Doug (Percy Wetmore) Hutchison, the guy you love to hate has a screen presence that will catapult him into more roles and a brighter future. If I had one thing to say about this motion picture it would be how well cast it was- Actor to Role.     I can't think of ANYONE ELSE performing in the roles of this film."

","Having read the book this past summer, I very much looked forward to the film.  I was not disappointed.  As good as, if not better than, the book.  The choice of another actor to play the Tom Hanks role as an old man rather than Mr. Hanks himself with makeup was a great idea.  The very versatile Hanks was natural and believable in his low-key approach to his role. Always strong and responsible in his authority but gentle in his dealings with the condemned.  Percy was superb as the villain (villains can be superb, you know) as were his antitheses Brutus and Dean. Barry Pepper as Dean is an actor I want to see more of in the future.  That face I shall never forget as the sharpshooter from ""Saving Private Ryan.""  Mr. Duncan was as I imagined John Coffey.  Compassion in the flesh.  Cynics will hate this film (and are already doing so) but we romantics and dreamers who love Mozart as well as Beethoven should thank Mr. Darabont for enriching our lives with 180+ minutes of artful grace.  It's not always easy to watch but Stephen King does not write to make us feel comfortable, being a prophet of the dark as well as the light.  I wish the movie well.  Perhaps it may even win an award or two.  Can a mouse be nominated for best"

","The Shawshank Redemption was a great movie - it had some flaws, most prominent of which was its tendency to manipulate emotions, but there was too much good about it for the bad to be glaring.<br/><br/>But in The Green Mile, Shawshank's flaws are amplified.  Darabont pretty much maps out how the audience should feel at every point in the movie.  He never really gives the audience a chance to decide how they feel on their own.  Some scenes more than got their point across, but Darabont continued to draw them out, to make sure that even those that already fell asleep caught his drift.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my other point - I have always had a problem with the MTV-generation of films that cannot stand still, but this film could definitely have stood further editing.<br/><br/>I didn't think the movie stunk.  The acting was outstanding (despite Tom Hanks once again playing the nice guy role), and I did appreciate the shots of humor that kept the proceedings slightly more brisk than they should have been.  There are some standout scenes as well that perked me up amidst the sloggier parts.  In reality, it was just a movie that went too far too often to make the audience gasp.

I pretty much saw most ""surprises"" coming, but the movie worked so hard to get there that it didn't bother me. I didn't have a problem with the running time, as I think it was important to develop a genuine familiarity with the characters. My heart was heavy after leaving the theater, but I respect a movie that can affect me like that, in an honest fashion. The movie is perfectly cast from Hanks to William Sadler in the role of the father of the girls. Everyone is good, but I was especially impressed with Sam Rockwell and Michael Jeter. I've only seen Rockwell in one other thing, and that was some stupid drunk-driving after-school-type special I had to watch for health class six years ago. I can remember back then thinking he had talent, and continue to think so, as he made Wharton perversely funny, while still a soul-less b***ard.<br/><br/>I had the misfortune of not seeing Shawshank until it came out on video.

"Cochese-6","Null","0","0","14 December 1999"," Entertaining, but Melodramatic
","First off, this is no ""Shawshank Redemption."" However, Frank Darabont keeps a very similar mood in ""The Green Mile."" To start off, the movie is very well acted, particularly by Sam Rockwell and Ron Hutchinson.( Rockwell's Wild Bill is one of the most spontaneous and crazy villains I've ever seen.) David Morse plays his role with quiet dignity,and Tom Hanks is pretty good, but I wouldn't expect any nominations coming his way for his performance. The direction deals with the film in a way that makes the length very appropriate. The scenes before Duncan's John Coffey is introduced, are not rushed, and allow the viewer to fully capture the atmosphere of the death row strip known as The Green Mile.       However, the movie is cursed with melodrama. (Why do directors add a score to a film's most sincere moments?!? Can't they see this ruins the impact?!?) This is not to say that you won't be touched by John Coffey, or the killing off of certain characters, but it does water the moments down a little.<br/><br/>    But the thing I like most about ""The Green Mile,"" that I'm sure many viewers will hate, is how much it leaves to the viewer's imagination. It allows the viewer to think about the various levels of meaning in the film, by leaving certain events open to mystery. Some parts are excellently directed, but overall, it's a disappointment given all the anticipation. I'd give it a 7 on the imdb scale."
"SKG-2","7","0","0","14 December 1999"," Huge disappointment
","Like a lot of people, I was really looking forward to this movie.  Though I didn't think THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION was the greatest movie ever made, I did like it a lot, I liked Stephen King's serialized novel, and I like the cast.  So how did this movie go wrong?  Well, ""wrong"" is perhaps too strong a word, since there are good things about it.  All the performances are good, and there are moments of real power(***SPOILER ALERT*** Like when Sam Rockwell grabs Michael Duncan.  Having read the novel, I knew it was coming, but Frank Darabont sets it up so well it truly is a shock. ***END SPOILER ALERT***).  And maybe my opinion of the film is tempered by the fact the theater showing it had projector trouble about 2/3 of the way through.  But I don't think that's it.<br/><br/>One of the reason King's stories, when he's on, are so good is his characters are just ordinary people.  He doesn't try to make them insufferably noble.  And while the supernatural is his territory, he makes sure he grounds it in reality.  But in this movie, that goes out the window. I know John Coffey is a symbol, but in the novel he was also a real human being, and here, he's just a symbol, which gets to be tiring after awhile. And while I know this is a fable, and not a realistic story, Darabont lays things on awfully thick, especially when Hanks finds out what really happened to those two girls.  If I remember correctly, in the novel, he finds that out on his own, which is part of what I meant about grounding it in reality.  And while I am not among those who think movies are too long(if you think about it, a lot of the really good movies this decade have been over two hours), this feels longer than its 3 hour plus running time.<br/><br/>As I said, I didn't hate this movie, but considering the talent involved, it has to be counted as a disappointment."

The entire audience was caught up in it and I could hear people around me just bawling.  That said, this movie was 5 minutes too long.  Right at the end, it seemed like Darabont suddenly felt the need to explain what needed no explanation.  Rather than let the story and images speak for themselves, he crammed way too much into the end.  As a result, the last few scenes with Dabbs Greer nearly completely ruin the incredible movie that had been built to that point."

","The Green Mile was visually impressive.  The story, though I have not read the novel, was quite compelling.  However, good cinematography and a great story do not always make for a great film.  The Green Mile lacked the... ""edge"" we saw in The Shawshank Redemption or in movies such as Shakespeare in Love or, for you Tom Hanks fans, Forest Gump.<br/><br/>The development of The Shawshank Redemption was brilliant.  It seemed as if every scene had at least two purposes: the scenes developed the story as well as the characters.  The audience was constantly thinking.  In The Green Mile, it seemed that each sequence had either one purpose or the other. This contributed to the length of the film.  The audience can't help to wait for the end of one predictable scene after another.<br/><br/>While trudging through The Green Mile, I couldn't help but suspect that if a little more time had gone into the preproduction and a more compact, while more meaningful, screen play had been written, the film would have lived up to its full potential."

Still, the script is tight and the story is told more efficiently and effectively than in King's novel.  The slow pacing in this movie that so many critics complain about is essential to the story--this movie is about waiting for death, and waiting for a conclusion in so many ways.<br/><br/>The performances were all flawless, with no exceptions.

There were several surprises that I was not able to participate in, and the anticipation of one particularly catastrophic scene nearly sent me fleeing from the theatre (rest assured, while the scene in the film was extremely powerful and disturbing, it wasn't nearly as graphic as it is in the book).  This drawback aside, ""The Green Mile"" was without a doubt the best film I've seen all year.<br/><br/>It would be a travesty if Michael Duncan does not receive an Oscar for his phenomenal portrayal of John Coffey.  He had me crying at nearly every scene he was in.  Doug Hutchison, David Morse and Michael Jeter also gave terrific performances, and Tom Hanks was... Tom Hanks.  You can always count on him for a reliably moving performance.<br/><br/>When going to see this film, be sure to bring some hankies (preferably Marcal brand, because they do not test on animals).  My sister claimed that she didn't need tissues because she's not a ""cry-at-movies"" type of person. Well, she only made it a little more than halfway through before she was bawling like the rest of us.  There wasn't a dry eye in the theatre by the final scenes.<br/><br/>Also, try not to go in with preconceived notions about this being a ""Shawshank"" sequel.  The settings for the two may be similar, but they are radically different films, with totally separate feels.  ""The Green Mile"" is definitely strong enough to stand on it's own.

I would imagine many people will be disappointed if Darabont and Michael Clarke Duncan don't receive top honors for this masterpiece.  Duncan's performance as the gigantic black man accused of murdering two young white girls in 1930's Louisiana is superb, shining with a sense of innocence and humility despite his intimidating stature.  Tom Hanks brings his  usual fantastic performance to the roll of the death row block supervisor, and the supporting rolls are well-cast and solid.  The message of the film is very clear, ""Love one another.""   King's character development is so precise that we find ourselves emotionally attached to these death row inmates and hurt for them as they approach their pending execution dates.  Darabont's last film, the wonderful ""Shawshank Redemption"" taught a lesson about living our lives and hope for the future while ""The Green Mile"" teaches us to love one another and gives us hope for what lies beyond death.

Cinematically speaking, i knew i was in for an aesthetic treat.<br/><br/>the part that surprised me was the degree of supernatural elements present in the movie.  when John Coffey threw his head back and spewed out what looked like tiny bees escaped from the X-files set, i was taken aback and couldn't help but utter a ""what?"" to myself, with furled brows and a scrunched up nose. it distracted me somewhat, but i eventually got over it.<br/><br/>the only other complaints i have about this movie are a few lines of dialogue and a couple of bad edits.  the characters themselves were vastly intriguing, and i was especially engrossed with the performances of Hanks, Morse, and Pepper.  there was a real sense of humility and compassion among the characters that brought home a sense of how day-to-day living continued through the Depression.  clearly, priorities of that era differ from those of today.  this theme tied in very well with the take-home message in the movie: that everyone walks their own Green Mile, and no one ever knows how long it really is.<br/><br/>the botched execution scene hurt me terribly, and i felt emotions run through to my very bones.  the thought of Delacroix's physical pain and the mental pain (from Wetmore's last-minute Mouseville revelation)broke my heart, truly.  not just for Delacroix, but for Edgecombe and the other guards who could only imagine how horribly that man's life ended.<br/><br/>Percy Wetmore.  for the first time, in a long time, i frightened myself with the degree of hatred i felt for an antagonist.  i chuckled to myself when Wetmore wet himself and couldn't help a delicious sense of vengeance toward him during ""payback""<br/><br/>
all around, best casting i've seen this year.  nice to see many of the very same actors we saw in Shawshank.  all performances were spectacular, and real on-screen chemistry seeped off the walls.  these guys were inside the story, and the result was perfection.  special kudos to Barry Pepper: engrossing to watch him on the screen, for strength of his acting talents and ease on the eyes."

","The quest to produce the greatest movie ever has eluded filmakers for decades. Many will say that nothing can topple Citizen Kane as the standard to compare to. Indeed, such a remarkable movie is not so easily forgotten. But how do we define a great movie? Great actors? Talented directors or Authors? A ridiculous Hollywood budget? These all help, yet the defining element of a truly great movie is how it moves you. The Green Mile moves the masses because it addresses one thing every living being has in common: death, as well as our fear of death. The film is filmed in exquisite detail that is accurate, but understated. Tom Hank plays a subtle character, allowing the other characters to breath and develop. As well, James Cromwell and Gary Sinise do remarkably well with their minor characters. The real prize goes to Michael Duncan, playing the condemmend (and enormous) John Coffey. The movie is without a doubt emotional, there is an execution scene that will forever haunt me. The humor is well placed to relieve the audience from the overall sad theme. Yet the tear-jerking scenes near the end are milked. It seems director Frank Darabont was going for the ""Kleenex effect"". That's all well and good, but Tom Hank's Forrest Gump in his 5-minute grave soliliquy to Jenny was more effective more than the 20 minute ""walkin' the mile"" near the end.

Tom Hanks deserves the Best Actor this year.  It may be tough, but his southern drawl which one him his second statue has a definite chance of getting him to the podium again.  Stephen King and Frank Darabont are geniuses.  With those two working together, they are bound for Oscar glory. Kudos to Frank Darabont on a spiritually engrossing script.  He deserves Best Director and Screenwriter, that is if American Beauty doesn't beat him to the chase.  Bottom line:  DON'T MISS THIS FILM!!!!  YOU'LL BE SORRY IF YOU DO!!!!!!!"

","This movie directed by Frank Darabont has to be the most overrated movie of the last two decades. The plot is shallow, unrealistic and above all absurd. Not just that the pretentious and so called emotional moments in the film aren't moving and touching, but they are also laughable and ridiculous. The scenes featuring the mouse (Mr. Jingles),Percy Wetmore and 'Wild Bill' Wharton reminded me of the cartoons I used to watch in my childhood. To put it simply, its a bad combination of mawkish sentimentalism and make beliefs. I don't care if the film is predictable but the pathetic attempts of audience manipulation and superficial treatment should keep this movie out of the top 250 movies in IMDb.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes were too dragging, meaningless and hollow. Some others were too chaotic and deranged. Overall the film is a classic example of bad filmmaking. We cant really rate the actors as there is no scope of performance in such a poorly directed film."

With little surpises, a bland story, and pointless tacked-on fillers at the beginning and the end, it would surprise me if anyone would want to see this movie twice.  Not nearly as good as Shawshank.  Almost all of the jokes fall flat, which becomes embarrasing to watch... Darabont didn't spend a lot of time on this script, by his own admission even.  From Shawshank, I was expecting some stirring music and cinematography in The Green Mile. Neither were present.  In fact, the cinematography was so bad it almost gave me a headache.  I felt like I was watching a B movie, with all the non-stop close-ups, occuring at a methodic static pace.  Would you watch this movie again?  If not, how can you say it is the best movie of 1999?

","I am starting to like Stephen King's work more now, and I read the book. A wonderful book, that is faithfully(mostly) adapted into an equally wonderful film. My only complaint of The Green Mile is the length, I do think it is too long. However, The Green Mile is a film that is haunting, thought-provoking, moving and engrossing.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully directed by Frank Darabont(director of the slightly superior The Shawshank Redemption), is beautifully shot with a foreboding setting and atmospheric cinematography and lighting and has an engrossing and haunting story that is well-paced too. Thomas Newman's score is positively hypnotic and very beautiful, with some great authentic song choices, my favourite being Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams(And Dream Your Troubles Away).<br/><br/>The script is thoughtful too, and the movie also has a big emotional impact without feeling manipulative, I honestly couldn't help crying at the end of the movie. I have to say as well, the execution scenes were really quite harrowing. The performances are strong, Tom Hanks is excellent as the warden, as is Doug Hutchison who gives a credibility and complexity to a character that could have easily been clichéd and David Morse as Brutus. But Michael Clarke Duncan is the actor I want to give the real kudos to, he has a wonderful character and he absolutely nails it.<br/><br/>Overall, a very, very good movie. Had it been shorter, it would have been perfect. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"MBunge","5","3","8","4 February 2011"," The best bad movie I've ever seen
","Sometimes it's fun to criticize a bad movie, but not always. The Green Mile is the first bad movie it is going to physically pain me to criticize.<br/><br/>This is a story about the death row at a Louisiana prison in 1935. Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the hard yet decent man in charge of this last stop for prisoners on their way to the electric chair. Paul is good friends with his boss, Warden Hal Moores (James Cromwell), and is a good leader of his fellow guards. His three closest co-workers are the appropriately named ""Brutal"" Howell (David Morse, the young Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper) and the middle-aged Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey DeMunn). These are 4 decent men trying to do an unpleasant task as well as it can be done.<br/><br/>The 5th guard on death row is not so decent. Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) is a mean, weak and petulant young man who got his job in the prison because he's the nephew of the governor's wife. If Paul or anyone else bothers him, it would just take one call from Percy to cost them their jobs. In the Depression, that's better protection than a platoon of marines.<br/><br/>The other important characters in this tale are Jan Edgecomb (the gorgeous Bonnie Hunt), the kind and tender wife of Paul; the vile and deranged death row prisoner ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Sam Rockwell); a meek and comical Green Mile inmate named Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) and his pet mouse Mr. Jingles; the warden's fatally ill wife Melinda (Patricia Clarkson); and most of all, a gigantic black prisoner named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan).<br/><br/>John Coffey was condemned to die after he was found with the raped and bloody bodies of two young girls in his arms. But when Paul and the other guards witness and experience John Coffey's magical ability to heal people from their sicknesses and their suffering, they begin to doubt that God would grant that sort of power to any murderer and to dread the day when John Coffey will have to sit in that electric chair.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go any further into the story of The Green Mile because, well, there's really not that much of a story. I will say the acting in this film is almost universally superb and the direction by Frank Darabont is just as excellent. This movie looks good. It sounds good. It even feels good. For all that, though, The Green Mile is NOT a good film.<br/><br/>Firstly, at over three hours, it's just too flippin' long. You could easily cut out at least a half hour and probably 45 minutes and lose absolutely nothing. It's never completely boring, but it's so languid and placid and every scene takes forever to get started, to get going and to get done. It's the sort of too long movie that's not tough to get through the first time you see it, but if you try and watch it again you'll wonder how you ever made it through at all.<br/><br/>Secondly, as I mentioned before, there's very little story in this film. There are events that happen and things the characters do, but there's no real purpose to any of it because there's no real conflict or moral in this movie. None of these characters have to grapple with any problem and change because of it. Paul Edgecomb is the same hard yet decent man at the end of the movie that he was at the beginning. John Coffey's the same. Percy's the same. ""Wild Bill"" is the same. These characters don't live and breathe like genuine human beings, they're just cogs in a narrative machine. They have a function to serve and that's all. Percy, in particular, couldn't have been more two-dimensional if he'd been run over by a steamroller.<br/><br/>Thirdly, what story there ischeats. At the start of the movie, Percy is supposed to be untouchable because of his connections. But when it's necessary for Percy to be ""touchable"", those connections suddenly don't matter. The audience is supposed to fall in love with Eduard Delacroix, so what he did to get on death row is never even vaguely referenced even though his guilt is never disputed. For the big sad scene where everybody is supposed to cry, one character joins in with his tears even though there wasn't a single moment in the film to explain why he should be choked up. There's an irrationally cruel ending that 100% contradicts something established earlier in the film. And there isn't a single emotional moment in the whole thing that isn't obviously and blatantly manipulative.<br/><br/>Fourthly, as technically good a job as writer/director Frank Darabont did, he appears totally oblivious to the sharply clashing and diametrically opposed tones in his film. He simultaneously tries to achieve a stark, Shawshank Redemption-like realism and a Disney-like family film fantasy. There's both a botched execution where someone slowly burns to death and a prison escape so silly it could have come straight out of The Apple Dumpling Gang or an episode of Three's Company. The Green Mile has R-rated language and a G-rated performing mouse.<br/><br/>It bothers me to point out the flaws in this film. That's because so many of the individual pieces of the movie are done so well and it's clearly made with such earnest good intentions. The Green Mile is, in many ways, the best bad movie every made. You'll probably enjoy it a great deal if you have low standards and I truly don't mean that in any condescending way. When a film has these sorts of basic problems, though, it doesn't do anyone any good to pretend they're not there."
"searchablesprite","2","3","8","27 January 2000"," So much wrong here
","Comparisons of The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption will be inevitable: same author, same director, similar settings.  But where Shawshank was an inspiring story of one man's believable struggle to keep hope and follow his dreams, Green Mile resorts to magic and sentimentalism to make a vague, sappy point.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, the ""point"" of this overlong artificiality is, simply put, some folk good and some folk bad.  It tries to be a stirring parable of accepting people for who they are, not what they're supposed to be, but several factors water it down.  The most glaring flaw is that the entire story hinges on a supernatural element.  How are we supposed to draw insight into our own lives from a movie that so heavily relies on fantasy?<br/><br/>The characters themselves are two dimensional stereotypes.  You've got your good and fair cop here, your bratty and abusive cop there, both watching over a weepy gentle giant and a mischievous hell-raiser.  But there's never anything revealed about these characters' pasts, nor insight into their motivations.  Throw in a subservient and acquiescent wife, a put-upon yet diplomatic warden, a hard-nosed trial lawyer and a lovable, feisty trusty for nice scenery and you've got the entire scope of this film.  There is very little character development, either.  The only evidence we have of any characters' development is the maudlin lines they say the same way they say them throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>All of these glossy, plastic elements in a film with a subject as controversial and sobering as capital punishment borders on the appalling. The film as a whole feels detached from the real world, and when the explicit violence that occurs is perpetuated upon cartoons, the film itself becomes a cartoon, too.  It rings hollow."
"mail-25","1","10","42","20 February 2000"," Insulting
","This movie very subtly hides it's ideology: sadism is not okay, but death penalty and the system that supports it are okay. Criminals are criminals, the death penalty is shown as the most natural consequence on earth. Like fate. Eye for an eye. The criminals are shown as kids. It's a perverted sitcom situation in a death row, with Tom Hanks as the father figure. Disgusting. And there's racism, too: John Coffee is Uncle Tom, has the mind of a 3 years old. A white man must reflect what's happening with Coffee, a white must command him.<br/><br/>The ""spiritual"" events are only superficial. They distract from the basic questions this movie cowardly avoids. About crime, punishment, remorse, duty. And why a Christian society thinks that it is okay to kill criminals.<br/><br/>Highly overrated and self-important movie"

","Steven King's recent novel The Green Mile left me spellbound.  It seems that he has been stuck in a penitentiary theme ever since the popularity of the motion picture adaption of his award winning novel The Shawshank Redemption, but The Green Mile is another great novel from Steven King.  I had the (neither good nor bad) fortune of seeing the screen adaption of The Green Mile this past weekend, and it was the worst movie I have seen in a long while.  Just when I thought Hollywood was beginning to produce more and more immaculate movies, something like this comes along.  The screenwriter/director and his entire extended family should hand their heads in shame.  Almost a mystical and angelic action in the book, John Coffey's expelling of foreign disease from his own body was nothing more than a random person blowing out what looked like bugs."

It is really sad when movies portray the simple act of not being a bigot as heroic. I guess for the period perhaps that was true, but it just adds to the lazy stereotypes in the movie. Percy is particularly laughable, over-reaching to be the arch-villain of the movie. Sad filmmaking lauded due to the cash, director, and its ambitions, but it is undeserving."

","I watched the Green Mile a few days ago and since then have come back to it twice. My children have sat through all three hours, silent, and obviously moved. While the magical elements are at times whimsical, the leisurely drawing of the characters and the sheer weight of Tom Hank's and the supporting cast's acting, ensure that what could have been an over sentimental movie leaves you with the feeling that you have spent a worthwhile 3 hours - a rare feeling. This is not a particularly challenging film - its treatment of the death penalty is ambiguous but this is not the real thrust of the plot - this is a film about people, love and moral conscience. Main criticism is the end - unnecessarily contrived adding nothing to the message."
"bhcesl","Null","2","5","8 October 2004"," You know the plot.
","I want to respond to the majority of comments made so far concerning the quality of ""The Green Mile"". The following is a list of comments I have read and felt deemed a response. I am not a movie critic, and I'm not a writer which means the following comments will be simple.<br/><br/>1. This movie is too long. It is long. I did not feel it was too long. There have been movies that were excellently done and I have wondered why they cut it short. I didn't feel that way during this movie. It was just right.<br/><br/>2. Too many characters are developed. I'd like to hear from those who said this which characters didn't need to be developed. Everyone played a role, everyone had a purpose, and everyone did a good job.<br/><br/>3. It's too chaotic/Too many subplots. I'd like to hear from those who said this what they would have eliminated from the movie. We needed to see the old Tom Hanks in the beginning so he could tell his story. We needed all the steps in between to feel crushed when John Coffey is executed. We needed to see how the death of the girls unfolded. Nothing was out of place and nothing was extra. It's also worth mentioning that a complicated canvas of characters and events more closely resembles life. Perhaps it's time movies start doing this more often. If a Russian novelist can get awards for writing a painfully detailed story, why shouldn't a movie?<br/><br/>4. The acting was subpar. Come on. Right. I don't want to be the one to say that crying during a scene means it was well done; that is certainly not correct. You cry during the Green Mile because you are in the movie. When someone acts badly, it's hard to suspend your disbelief. The acting was not goofy.<br/><br/>5. The humor threw the rhythm of the movie off. 3 hours of serious is a lot of serious. Stephen King likes to throw humor into even his darkest of novels (and movies). It works in the horror stories, and it works here.<br/><br/>6. What's the deal with this supernatural stuff? Hey, it's a cool addition. Probably it could have been written without the flies and healing, but why? After all, it is Stephen King.<br/><br/>7. The Delecroix execution was too violent. And electrocution isn't? Hey, we live in a society where we kill people for being too bad. I'm not saying I agree or disagree with the ethics of it, but if they author was trying to make a point, he did it well. And again, I say: It's Stephen King. He likes the violence, and this was a nice way to get it in there.<br/><br/>My final opinion, being the completely unqualified and inexperienced critic that I am, is: this movie is really good.

","I was at one point a great fan of Stephen King. I still list a couple of his works among my favorites, this one among them. The book, though marketed by a gimmicky (but fun) serialization, wove together a complicated story in two timelines. The prison story of John Coffey was a book within a book, and was carefully intertwined with the 1990s present of Paul Edgecomb(Tom Hanks).<br/><br/>The most grievous failing of this adaptation was the neglect of the way the timelines merged for Paul Edgecomb. Instead of this carefully intertwined story, viewers get a sappy version of the 1930s storyline, with a brief nod at the 1990s tale. While interesting in and of itself, the focus of the screenplay on the 1930s timeline left me annoyed at the piece of the puzzle that seemed left out to me.<br/><br/>In addition, I feel that Tom Hanks was probably not the best choice for Paul Edgecomb. Even in this serious roll, he gives off his own aura, constantly reminding me that he is Tom Hanks, not Paul Edgecomb.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending of the movie adaptation is lacking. The book's ending left me feeling the deep despair of the aged Paul Edgecomb. The movie just left me feeling annoyed."
"zeppelin-9","4","2","5","14 October 2000"," Predictable (SPOILERS)
","WARNING: SPOILERS<br/><br/>What a disappointment! The Green Mile is nothing but a predictable movie. The characters are too shallow. The four guards, John Coffey and Delacroix represent Good, Wild Bill and Percy represent Evil. The film gives us no reason why Percy acts the way he does, nor does it say why John Coffey has its power. Someone might think those powers were given to him by God, but it's nonsense. Why would God give someone the power to cure others, if he allows everyone to die? And why does he need a human to do it, when he can do it himself? And things like that. The film tries to make some critics, (""What the hell was that?"" ""A successful execution"" ""You call that successful?"" ""He's dead, isn't he?"") but the point is lost in the melodramatic atmosphere the director (unsuccessfully) tries to create. That scene when John Coffey is executed was simply ridiculous. I almost laughed. The Green Mile is just plain stupid. And that thing at the end? ""He infected us with life"". What was the purpose of that? Nothing, but to add more melodrama."

","I still don't know if I really liked the movie or just loved the actors and Tom Hanks surprisingly is not the strongest of these. The prisoners are such incredibly interesting people, especially the chilly ""Wild Bill"" and the crazy De La Croix. I didn't even recognize Patricia Clarkson who was so good as the heroin addict girl friend to Ally Sheedy's photographer in High Art, here is the sweet (too?) wife of the warden. It is a small role but she did the most with what she was given. Then there is that incredible center piece , the guy that plays John Coffey, the original gentle giant wrongly accused, incompetently represented, predictably convicted and oh so beatific.<br/><br/>The real problem is that this movie is: A. too long. <br/><br/>B Too predictable (Wild Bill was the real killer to me almost as soon as the warden told Hanks that they had a real hard case coming in.)<br/><br/>
C. too hackneyed in production (The storm the night De la Croix is executed.<br/><br/>
D. Too silly Does Hanks really have to pee that much (Maybe it is just me, but as career signatures go, I much prefer Nicholas Cage's fondness for Volvo's to Hanks peeing). and <br/><br/>E. Too gooey sweet, Brutal may be how a real death row guard operates, but this Brutal was the sweetest guy you will ever meet as were all of his cronies except of course for Percy. <br/><br/>Which brings us to Percy who epitomizes the movie as a whole, well acted but poorly scripted, after the botched job he did in front of witnesses even the governor is going to say to him ""son you {blew it} this time and there isn't anything we are going to do about it"" this if he is still there after failing to help another guard in an emergency. How can we believe this guy? As much fun as he is too watch strutting around getting us ready for his just reward (Is there ever any doubt that justice will be done?) he is like everyone else in the film written out of someone's fantasy book."

Especially the acting by Tom Hanks as the pleasent prison guard and more especially Michael Clarke Duncan as the miracle prisoner John Coffey (like the drink, only not spelled the same)and he not only gives his best performance yet, he gives probably the best performance of the decade.

","A short time before seeing this film, I had seen ""La Vita È Bella"". Naturally I compared these two films. I can't say that they are similar, but I found terms to compare them. I need to state that I loved ""La Vita È Bella"" and hated ""The Green Mile"". The first film teaches us to enjoy all the little pleasures of life, to try to always find the positive part of ones life (even if we are locked in a concentration camp). It is a difficult idea to accomplish but if we have that in mind we will probably have a much happier life. The second film ""alerts"" us to the awfulness of life, all it's tortures and injustices... It makes us really feel sick about ourselves and, for instances, you can only wish to die and be freed of this terrible life. If life is so painful and hard, the only thing you can do to make it better is to try to live it the best way possible, loving every moment of its short duration! We can't spoil life by feeling miserable every instant, that would be a waist of time and nothing would ever change.

Although the story is very emotional, the ""message"" is rather contradictory: How can you promote ""the Good"" and at the same time subliminally justify violence in some scenes?

"billm-4","Null","2","6","10 December 1999"," Overlong, incoherent, repulsive and ridiculous
","I found ""The Green Mile"" to be a massive disappointment in comparison with Frank Darabont's 1994 adaptation of another Stephen King story, also set in a prison, ""The Shawshank Redemption"". ""The Green Mile"" has a running time of just over three hours to tell a tale which could have been told more compellingly in 2 to 2.5 hours. You cannot avoid the feeling that the filmmakers had their eye on Oscar glory rather than making a fine film, and one of the unfortunate rules of thumb in this area is that long films have a better chance of winning than shorter competitors. Alas, there seems to be ample evidence of quantity defeating quality: ""Gandhi"" beating ""Tootsie"" in 1982 and ""Out of Africa"" beating ""Witness"" in 1985, to name but two.<br/><br/>Unlike many Stephen King stories, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" had no supernatural elements. This was a major advantage in restraining the crazier excesses of the writer's imagination and making the film touching and credible. Unfortunately, ""The Green Mile"" has a miracle-working prisoner on death row. The wonder worker has the initials J.C., just in case you missed the crass symbolism of an innocent healer being unjustly condemned to death.<br/><br/>
Most miracles tend to be arbitrary favours bestowed for no apparently consistent reason by a capricious Deity. Why do only a tiny fraction of people who go to Lourdes get cured, in comparison with the huge numbers of apparently equally devout and deserving pilgrims? Here, the saintly (if mentally challenged) John Coffey is apparently able to cure the terminally ill on demand. The limitations of 1930s medicine are cruelly highlighted. Tom Hanks' noble prison officer character, Paul Edgecombe, has a painful and embarrassing bladder problem which would probably be cleared up quickly by modern antibiotics. In 1934 he faces the alternatives of nausea-inducing sulfa drugs, or allowing Nature to take its slow, distressing course in healing him. J.C. can, of course, cure him in seconds by laying on of hands, absorbing the ""poison"" into his own body and exhaling it through his mouth in the visible form of droplets.<br/><br/>The good John was apparently aware of his powers (which extend so far as performing a Lazarus-resurrection job on a badly crushed mouse) before he entered prison. This gives rise to hundreds of obvious questions, such as why he did not do a similar Lazarus job on the two murdered little girls with whom he was caught. Perhaps that was beyond even his powers, for some unexplained reason. More seriously, his supernatural gift highlights countless idiocies in the plot development. <br/><br/>This J.C. was apparently not even immaculately conceived and born in a stable; he seems to have been delivered into the world fully grown to his 6.5 feet, 300 pound-plus bulk. He apparently had no prior life history before he was caught with the bloodstained corpses of the little girls in his arms and obviously had not demonstrated his healing powers anywhere, as otherwise he would surely have become quickly reknown as a miracle worker, at least in a local area. Even after he has cured the prison warden's wife of a terminal brain tumour in front of several witnesses, he is still apparently on his way to the electric chair. Even worse, he seems (again, for an unexplained reason) to be unable to ""exhale"" the poison from the brain tumour and is terminally ill himself. Never fear, he is able to ""exhale"" the illness into a suitably vile prison officer. This infusion of the bad vapours apparently affects the villain's brain in a non-fatal way - we last see him incarcerated in a mental institution. <br/><br/>This cure of the prison warden's wife is yet another dumb episode which prolongs the excessive running time. Apparently, the combined brainpower of all the officers on Death Row could not devise a legal way of getting the wife and saintly John together for a healing session - they have to smuggle John out of prison to the warden's home in the middle of the night in a complex operation. Also, even when it is clear that John can do cures on demand, no one suggests that his abilities be publicly proven. If he cured a few dying children, would that not help his case for a reprieve, or at least a stay of execution? Well, it might, but it would also impede the risibly bogus plot mechanics where Saint Tom Hanks and his fellow officers end up executing an innocent man, have dreadful pangs of conscience, etc, etc.<br/><br/>The vile prison officer must be one of the most thankless ""bad guy"" roles foisted on any actor. Doug Hutchison does his best with the loathsome Percy Wetmore and occasionally suggests some humanity within his worthless carcass. I assume his unfortunate surname comes from his loss of bladder control under stress, clearly shown in one scene. However, much of the time the script portrays him as a coward, liar, sadist, manipulator and bully, constantly invoking his influential relatives who will take terrible reprisals against anyone at the prison who offends him. This is yet another unexplained imbecility in the script: if this creep has such powerful connections, why is he doing such a horrible and dangerous job on Death Row? Why have his relatives not already landed him a safe and cushy desk job elsewhere in the State sector? The only motive implied is that he gets a kick out of seeing people suffer and wants the chance to witness, and indeed supervise, an execution close-up.<br/><br/>Of course, poisonous Percy does get this chance. In one of the most gratuitously horrible scenes you are ever likely to witness in a cinema, he deliberately sabotages the execution of a prisoner by NOT wetting a sponge in saline solution before it is placed on the condemned man's head. Thus the electrical contact is imperfect, and the victim screams out in ghastly agony as he is slowly fried alive. It makes an unforgettable scene in support of abolishing the death penalty, or at any rate this form of it. I suppose it is one of the few points you can make in favour of this abysmal film.<br/><br/>Other points in its favour include the excellent cinematography, set and costume design and a very fine cast, especially Tom Hanks, David Morse and James Cromwell. It is a great shame that, as in so many films, the enormous talents of both cast and crew have been wasted on such repulsive and ridiculous dreck. I would give it 3 out of 10, and those three points purely for technical and acting competence."

"vicrknudsen","9","1","2","13 August 2019"," Review of ""The Green Mile""
","Directed by Frank Darabont
Written by Frank Darabont
Starring: Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Bonnie Hunt, Jeffrey DeMunn, Bart Pepper, Michael Jeter, James Cromwell and Sam Rockwell<br/><br/>When I talk about films, with my friends, I often talk about my favourite films or my least favourtie films. Both in which are very debatable and it a totally personal opinion. There are good films and there are bad films. And then we have the films that stand out to me. ""The Green Mile"" is one of them.
The 1990's was a decade in the film history, where the quality was reaching another level. More advandced technology were avalable, and a lot of new-comers had their entry in the 90's.
1994. Probaly the best year in in films ever, and a year where two talented directors had their time to shine. The one we all know as Quentin Tarantino, with his crtitically acclaimed ""Pulp Fiction"". And Frank Darabont, who made Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" into a glorious feature-film debut for ""The Shawshank Redemption"". A film that now-days stands high on almost every movie-critics' top 10 list.
Darabont made his name famous and a few years later he worked on a film, also adapted from a Stephen King novel, ""The Green Mile"".
This 3-hour epic is quiet possible the best of the best of cinema, that has ever been crafted.
Every single element of the genius-written story and touching performances reach its peak in such perfection, it is hard for me to belive why anyone wouldn't like this film.
""The Green Mile"" tells the story about a prison guard and his team, working on the death row in a prison. Their lives are affected, when a black man, John Coffey, who is accused for raping and the murder of two children, comes to the death row and waits for his conviction.
This phenomenal movie stands out from all other films that has ever been made, by simply just letting the story to be told. Even though it's a 3-hour long film it never feels long or at least not too long. Every element just hit the perfect note, in every single scene. And most of this are due to the highly-talented director and screenwriter, Frank Darabont. His second film, and yet again he shows that he is one of the finest directors on the planet. His way to tell a story has been done so well, I cannot put any words onn how genius and perfect it is.
The film was nominated for four Academy Awards at the 72nd Academy Awards ceremony including one for best suppoting actor to Michael Clarke Duncan, who play the inmate John Coffey. His acting skills of this film are beoynd any actors' standard. He is a teriffic actor and has been casted for the perfect role in ""The Green Mile"". The rest of the cast are also very good, with Tom Hanks in the lead, nothing can go wrong.
Techincal, ""The Green Mile"", are a gorgeous looking film. It's musical score is written by Thomas Newman, who again shows off his skills in conducting a beautiful score and build up tension at the right moment. Also the movie is shot very beautifully.<br/><br/>In my opinion, ""The Green Mile"" is a better film than ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Though, they're both very strong films, with each of their own qualities, I just prefer ""The Green Mile"". It has all what it takes to be a masterpice of cinema. On a technical level, and on an emotional level. Don't miss out any chance of seeing ""The Green Mile"".
It ranks on my personal Top 50 movies.<br/><br/>I give ""The Green Mile"" 5 / 5 stars"
"Bored_Dragon","10","1","2","30 July 2019"," ""I've done some things in my life I'm not proud of, but this is the first time I've ever felt in real danger of hell.""
","I usually comment on movies right after watching them, while still under strong impressions. Of course, provided that the film does leave impressions. Movies over two hours I watch in halves, two days in a row, or even thirds, in case they are extremely long and slow-paced. Also, I tend to ""rewind"". I often watch certain scenes two or more times, whether to understand them better or simply because I like them. I take breaks to search the Internet for answers to questions that pop into my head (Where have I seen this actor before? When did this guy die? What exactly does this word mean?), to make screenshots of powerful cadres, write a note in the skeleton of future review, do something that comes to mind and I'm afraid I'll forget if I don't do it right away...<br/><br/>""The Green Mile"" lasts over three hours. It flew by faster than a sitcom episode. I saw it in one breath, without a single ""rewinding"" or pausing, without even blinking. Without a single thought unrelated to the movie. I don't remember the last time a movie caught my attention like this, and when it ended, I was left speechless. Even now, a day later, I am unable to write anything analytical about it. The technical aspects are excellent, but essentially irrelevant. I would only like to mention the performance of Michael Clarke Duncan, which was so convincing and full of emotional charge that he repeatedly brought tears to my eyes. The story this movie tells, the message and the emotion it conveys, are enough to make this film fully deserving of its reputation and its high place on the list of the best films of all time, side by side with ""The Shawshank Redemption"". If I recall correctly, King himself stated that this film is the most faithful adaptation of one of his novels. And when it comes to adaptations of Stephen King, we can divide them into two groups - Frank Darabont's adaptations and all the other adaptations that, compared to Darabont's, can only go to the corner to be ashamed of themselves (with the exception of Kubrick's ""The Shining"" and Reiner's ""Misery"").<br/><br/>10/10"

","""The Green Mile"" tells the story of a strange prisoner, a very big and muscular man, who is sentenced to death for murdering two small girls. As the prison staff, which behaves generally very kind towards the prisoners, get to know this one better, he shows signs of some supernatural power floating through his body, yet is destined for death.<br/><br/>It is very easy to build up empathy with many characters of the movie. It is indeed a heart-touching story presented well but that's pretty much it. I'm neither a huge Stephen King fan, nor a huge fan of paranormal happenings in realistic surroundings, so you might want to read my preview with caution but having some kind of modern day Jesus in the death tract of an american prison is at least let's say.. an interesting choice. What you get is a well-produced adaption with some well-known actors. Unfortunatelly, I found the film to be not very suspenseful and it didn't really catch me and made me desire for more.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is sure worth a watch, the more so if you generally like King's way to build up storys and mix them with fantastic elements. Otherwise this is a rather basic film with a rather odd plot."

","A few weeks ago, I finished Stephen King's novel ""The Green Mile"" and realized that I was about the only person on the planet who had not seen the film adaptation. Upon viewing the 3-hour piece of work, I was amazed by the degree to which King's writing was able to be translated to the big screen (as opposed to, say, ""Hearts In Atlantis"", which left much to be desired).<br/><br/>The plot of the film is exactly the same as that of the book, centering on a 1930s death row prison and the strange (paranormal?) events that transpired there. All the actors are dead-on in their interpretation of King's characters, such as the inspired Paul Edgecombe (Tom Hanks), the lunatic guard Percy Wetmore(Doug Hutchison), the even loony-er prisoner ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Sam Rockwell), and the hulking, meek inmate John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), from which the story really draws from.<br/><br/>I won't give away any plot details here, but suffice it to say that pretty much everyone will enjoy this film. While the subject matter and language (the film IS set in a prison) rules out the kiddies, pretty much anybody else should find it to be an inspiring journey, as the movie explores the themes of death, love, and doing the noble deed in the face of great opposition.<br/><br/>I don't say this for many book-film combinations, but in this case you may actually be better off in seeing the film, as the acting is so wonderful and the plot does not deviate from the novel."

","If you've never seen 'The Green Mile', then you need to at least once in your lifetime. A truly beautiful adaptation of Stephen King's book of the same name based in Death Row of an American prison between the 1920 and 1930'<br/><br/>The backdrop is a hot, unforgiving summer in what was the springtime of the guards lives. Led by Tom Hanks's character Paul Edgecomb, the men discover the extraordinary gifts of a prisoner by the the name of John Coffey who was to be executed for the rape and murder of two little girls. John was played by the late Michael Duncan Clarke, a man whose soulful demeanour and muscular build brought the adaptation of the character alive from the very first minute you meet him on screen. Despite John's size, his gentle demeanour and vulnerability soon reveals an extraordinary gift as Paul opens up to John about his urine infection. The guards set about utilising him to cure others. <br/><br/>The film brings to the fore the harsh reality of the guards duties whereby they walk the condemned prisoners to their eventual execution along the last walk of their lives along the green painted floor dubbed 'The Green Mile"".<br/><br/>The film depicts the array of emotions one would naturally expect, purveying the horrors of prison life, remorse and eventually death. Characters such as Wild Bill and Percy, both cruel and sadistic, thwart the lives of Paul, his men and prisoners under his charge. <br/><br/>John, whilst in transit, discovers that Wild Bill is the true murderer of the two girÄºs for whom he'd eventually be executed for dispenses his own justice upon him. Percy, after deliberately sabotaging an execution of a prisoner, also receives a similar fate of his own when John infects him with a tumour thus leaving an inpatient of the local psychiatric hospital.<br/><br/>The film is tinged with both good times and sad, particularly when John is finally executed, breaking the spirits of Paul and the guards fortunate to have met him.<br/><br/>It truly is a piece of cinematic gold and needs to be watched from start to finish in its entirety, giving you an appreciation of life's trials and tribulations."

","Just now I finished watching the movie and I feel so complicated.By the end of the story,I thought it would be peaceful,but I was wrong.Every one Paul loved and cared left him,and even the mouse died too.I saw the dark side of the world when Percy executed Edward.At that moment I couldn't help crying because he seemed so painful. On the other hand,John Coffey was an angel.I think there must be a reason why John was afraid of darkness and why there was bright light when John was helping others.Probably because the darkness symbolized the world filled with violence and cruelties and the light symbolized the heaven without them.As an angel that came from heaven,he was so lonely,just as Paul,he saw everybody's pain every single day.That's also why John did't want to get rid of death.

","Straight up, Frank Darabont is a ""great"" in the making. The story-is-God dedication that transformed The Shawshank Redemption into a modern classic is much in evidence in this lavish, confident fantasy drama, but he may be hamstringing himself with his dogged devotion to pop-horror guru Stephen King's prison-inspired output. The Green Mile impresses, shines, awes, jabs the heart at moments, but it is no Shawshank. King wrote the book as an experiment in serialized fiction - six even parts each cliffhanger-ed to the next - and at a bot-busting three-plus hours, the movie feels like watching a whole mini-series in one sitting. There's certainly a lot of great stuff here. But be warned, you'll need stamina.<br/><br/>Directing, Darabont was reputedly infuriatingly meticulous, every scene finessed with a Kubrick-esque repetition of takes in search of perfection. It has paid off. This slowburn 30s-set tale of a prison Death Row (the corridor, here lime green, is known as the mile) shaken by the arrival of a dim-witted giant (Clarke Duncan) accused of slaughtering two baby girls, is a paragon to expert detail.<br/><br/>The performances are subtle, the script (by Darabont) faithful to King's prose, the style elegant and poised and the big moments suitably grandiose. The crux of the matter is that the gentle seven-footer John Coffey has the miraculous, quasi-Holy power to heal. And heal he does, from narrator and Row boss Paul Edgecomb's (Hanks) graphic urinary infection, to pet mouse Mr. Jingles, squashed by the Rows bully boy new recruit Percy Wetmore (Hutchison). All of which, combined with Coffey's ethereal view of what separates the good and bad, convinces the rattled Edgecomb that he must be innocent.<br/><br/>Over the epic running time the film inches its way through a complex soap opera of events on the Row, punctuated by three pivotal and grisly executions via ""Old Sparky"", the electric chair. And, a la Saving Private Ryan, the story is told care of a mysterious flashback framework. All of which works brilliantly. Yet, when denouements unravel and Coffey works his magic - marked by a freaky spewing of tiny black insects into the air - it is all far less staggering than the build up signals. In the main this is down to the sheer length - and so much of it superfluous - that patience is exhausted and drama dampened. There is also a lot less going on here than Darabont reckons, ostensibly boiling down to a simple take on the evil-that-men-do.<br/><br/>Polished it is, profound it ain't. A big, tasty meal that lacks the nourishment of Shawshank.It is harsh, though, to judge solely against such a startling debut and The Green Mile is about as accomplished a piece of storytelling as you'll come by. Morse, Clarke Duncan, Bonnie Hunt as Edgecomb's wife and, especially, Hutchison weave their own acting magic. Hanks every man routine may have become so ingrained it virtually doesn't register, but you can't imagine the movie without him. And Darabont, the real star, is a director in a classic- tradition. Give him a story and he delivers a real movie. Time, though, to ditch King."
"pinoverde","10","1","2","9 March 2016"," What to say
","What to say, one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen! It makes 3 hours pass like a second. One day a new prisoner arrives. He is a gigantic black man, framed by the low-angle camera to loom over the guards and duck under doorways. This is John Coffey (""like the drink, only not spelled the same""), and he has been convicted of molesting and killing two little white girls. From the start it is clear he is not what he seems. He is afraid of the dark, for one thing. He is straightforward in shaking Paul's hand--not like a man with anything to be ashamed of. The actors are the best and nothing else to say. Best of all"
"KavianAtabaki","8","1","2","20 January 2016"," One of the best prison films ever made.
","The Green Mile is an amazingly soulful movie that features strong acting from an incredible cast. Frank Darabont directs another prison movie with style and humanism. He rarely directs films, but when he does they are usually knockouts (including the Shawshank Redemption & The Mist). Michael Clarke Duncan gives a simply wonderful performance here that rightfully got nominated for an Oscar. The fact that he died prematurely makes this even more of a heart- wrenching story to me. Tom Hanks is his reliably likable self and the rest of the cast is made up of good character actors. I thought most of the characters in this film were memorable. It's really hard to explain to someone without giving details away, but for first-timers this film will surprise you. The 3 hour run time seems long, but this film could not have been better paced. I never found myself checking the time. This is a classic that deserves to be seen."

Those 3 are not necessarily my favorite movies, but they are special for a different reason. These movies, Forrest Gump, Hatchiko and the Green Mile, engaged me so much emotionally, that I couldn't help but cry at the end. I don't want to take any of the plot away, but John Coffey is easily the most likable character in a movie since Forrest Gump. I don't think that the difficult part is to be sad enough to make someone cry, but to engage the spectators enough to commit that much of there emotions.

"CinematicInceptions","9","1","2","10 October 2015"," Incredible characters and emotion come together to make an amazing film.
","I won't go so far as to say that this movie is perfect, but it's easily one of the best-crafted films I've ever seen. It bleeds character and emotion of all kinds. It's not very pleasant to watch the whole time despite the joy of some scenes. In the end, it leaves you with a bittersweet aftertaste that you're not likely to lose for a while. As with the Shawshank Redemption, Frank Darabont is not afraid to horrify us by showing some of the worst treatment that men can give each other. But he rewards us with the righteous actions of the protagonists.<br/><br/>Our protagonists are clearly good men who make the best of their job of execution. Paul Edgecombe is our typical passive Tom Hanks character who happens to be present for incredible events, but comes out changed because of it. The secondary protagonist is falsely convicted child murderer John Cofey, a gentle giant with incredible powers and kindness. We get some exposition of the other guards and have reason to sympathize for them. They know how to treat their prisoners, whether by giving them the best death they can under the circumstances, or cracking the whip when necessary. We get to know a few of the other prisoners as well, particularly Dale and Wild Bill. It's great that the two of them have such incredible contrast because it shows us that bad men are still human but that they are also still dangerous. So having the foil of Wild Bill makes us like Dale that much more. Then comes our antagonist, Percy. Now, there are some villains that we're meant to just hate or just love, but Percy is someone that we love to hate. He abuses his privileged background by making the prisoners lives as miserable as he can. The thing that I think really makes him so detestable is that he stays within the rules of the law, but not within the rules of common decency. And he really shows us how bad you can legally be. His actions during Dale's execution are just about the epitome of adding insult to injury. Whenever I thought that the other guards were punishing him too cruelly, I would think back to Dale's execution and think, ""Yeah, he deserves every bit of that."" There are a few other minor characters such as the warden Hal and his wife, Paul's wife, and Arlen the first man they execute. Despite what problems people might have with the three-hour runtime, I would argue that it was definitely worth making the movie that long because of how good it developed the characters.<br/><br/>There isn't really a plot outside of the constant character development unless you count the progression of revealing John Cofey's powers and innocence. In these scenes there are a lot of setups and payoffs with the three people that John heals. I think having John heal Paul of a urinary infection was a good move. At first, the choice of ailment seems kind of gross, but making it something that personal and painful I think engages the audience a little better than something like a stomachache would. Then, we see John's power have an emotional impact when he revives Mr. Jangles and cures Hal's wife. One last story point I want to comment on is the development of the electric chair. We get the basics on how the whole execution process works, then see the peaceful death of Arlen. An hour or so later we see Dale's horrible execution and the horrors that occur when something ""goes wrong"". Then at the end, we have the beautifully sad death of John. I don't know quite why, but I thought the sequence that those were shown in was perfect.<br/><br/>The script is nice and consistent with each character and has pretty realistic dialogue. The acting is top notch because the actors are there to act and not to pose as models or anything like that. There aren't any great camera angles or tricks, but I guess it was well shot.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to just about everybody, even people who don't like long movies. There might be some scenes where you have to close your eyes due to emotional impact rather than gore. I guess the only reason you shouldn't watch it is if you don't like serious movies or have trouble paying attention. Aside from that, I see no reason for anyone to not at least give this a try. Overall Rating: 8.9/10."

","In this mesmerizing drama based on the hit novel by Stephen King, Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb, a prison guard at a a Louisiana death row penitentiary known as the Green Mile. His fellow prison guards include Brutus Howell (played by David Morse), Harry Telwinger (played by Jeffrey McDunn), and Dean Stanton (played by Barry Potter). Then there is Percy Whitmore (played by Doug Hutchinson), a cruel and sadistic guard who Paul only hires because he is the son of the state governor. His ruthless and appalling demeanor towards the prisoners gains him hatred by the fellow guards. On a long and ordinary, the guards are introduced to prisoner John Coffey (played by Michael Clarke Duncan), an unusually tall, buff man who is sentenced when he is falsely accused of the rape and murder of two little girls. Coffey soon reveals to have an incredible gift to heal people. This film is set in the 1930s during the Great Depression era.<br/><br/>When we are first introduced to John Coffey, he's not a man of many words. He says very little for quite some time, and is insulted by his fellow prison mates. As the story goes on, he learn some intriguing things about this character such as his ability to heal and take away illnesses. Michael Clarke Duncan delivers a highly enthralling performance as this character. His dialogue just touches your heart and leaves you breathless. His performance was nominated for Best Actor in Supporting Role that was sadly taken by Michael Caine in Cider House Rules. Tom Hanks is also impressive as Paul Edgecomb who forms a bond with Coffey and decides he wants to help him. Doug Hutchinson portrays Percy Whitmore, a character the viewers will want to punch in this face. Hutchinson gives off an ingenious portrayal of this character who enjoys watching others' pain and treats the prisoner with absolute cruelty. This is best demonstrated in the scene that introduces him when he agitates one of the prisoners and eventually breaks his hand, and in another scene, when he crushes a pet mouse under his foot, then another scene where he purposely sabotages a prisoner's execution that ends horrifically. Man! What a jerk! This story is very powerful and moving, and will undoubtfully have you reaching for tissues. Frank Darabont does a fantastic job at constructing story and characters as well as demonstrating some great cinematography.<br/><br/>The Green Mile is a must-see film for everyone.

","The Green Mile, based on Stephen King's 1996 novel, is a stirring drama of metaphysical fantasy wedded to grim reality. The central protagonist Paul Edgecombe (Tom Hanks), a prison guard for the Louisiana State Penitentiary for criminals on the death row, keeps things running smoothly on the Green Mile, so-named due to the scuffed green linoleum that covers the floor between the cells and the electric chair. He receives his convicted tenants with rare dignity and takes no pleasure in strapping them in to ride the lightning, seeing it instead as a sad, necessary business. Of course there's that urinary infection that makes him feel like he's ""pissing razorblades"" but Edgecomb tries to stay calm and compassionate. The ground under his feet begins to shift when John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), condemned to die by electrocution, arrives. A child-like giant, Coffey has been convicted of murdering two pre-pubescent girls in an apparently air-tight case; he was found with their bodies in his massive arms, covered in their blood. Despite his towering stature, he is a gentle man who seems to have a mysterious power much more important than physical might. Edgecomb senses the same, but only takes his own doubts to heart after Coffey displays a miraculous healing touch that cures him of his urinary infection. Soon, it is readily apparent that Coffey is no criminal. In fact, he is a miracle worker, an angel-on-earth with the power to heal and give life. This leaves Paul and the movie with a moral dilemma and throws out every preconceived notion of justice, faith, and redemption behind the barred windows.<br/><br/>Lovingly crafted, intense and pure of spirit, Frank Darabont delivers The Green Mile as a Biblical allegory that explores the range of human kindness and cruelty as he meticulously sculpts his large cast of characters against magnificent scenery, infusing a lustrous depth to the film. Despite its varying tone, the fact that the movie still comes together as a cohesive whole is testament to Darabont's talent and dedication to spinning a cinematic story that matches the literary source.<br/><br/>He also extracts wonderfully modulated performances from his entire cast. Tom Hanks embodies Edgecomb with a reliable decency without overselling it. The rest of the supporting cast also pitches in remarkable performances, especially Sam Rockwell as the psychotic Wild Bill, who is literally foaming at the mouth with evil and Doug Hutchison who gives a hauntingly vicious portrayal of the sadistic Percy Wetmore. But perhaps impressive of them all is Mr. Duncan as the imposing black man who despite being a dead man walking, is a Christ-like vehicle of God, capable of miracles. He puts up a deeply moving performance, showing us both Coffey's innocence and his dignity as he labors mightily to save his character from turning into a shallow stereotype, instead proving to be an unforgettable presence.<br/><br/>The Green Mile is indeed a rousing cinematic experience with a deeply human core. It's what I call movie-magic!"

","The lives of guards on Death Row are affected by one of their charges: a black man (Michael Clarke Duncan) accused of child murder and rape, yet who has a mysterious gift.<br/><br/>Starting off early with ""Top Hat"", not unlike its use in ""Purple Rose of Cairo"", one wonders if this old film has grown in popularity since its earlier days... but this is neither here nor there.<br/><br/>The writing of Stephen King is largely dismissed by critics, and the movies made of his books are very hit and miss. The same with Frank Darabont, whose work is overall nothing terribly special. Yet, somehow when they come together, they do amazing things, at least with prison films. Both this and ""Shawshank Redemption"" have sat firmly on IMDb's Top 250, usually very high on the list.<br/><br/>And this one should be. Maybe not high art like the French new wave films or the works of Chaplin, Kubrick and others, but this is a movie that will be timeless. One hundred years from now, it will still be remembered and enjoyed by fans. And that means something."
"dkshkndpal","9","1","2","8 May 2014"," don't miss this one!!!
","So, this is my first review on IMDb and i wanted to start with a movie that really affected me. The Green Mile gives you everything and more that you as a movie lover could ever ask for. Power pack performances, Tom Hanks never disappoints, standing right next to him are David Morse, Michael Duncan. I want to also point out the incredible performance delivered by Sam Rockwell as a heartless, blood hungry maniac. I was completely blown away by the story and especially Ducan's character who looks like a brute, but, in fact is the most innocent man on the face of the earth. The movie draws you in, deeper and deeper and makes you reflect on the kind of society that we are living in. Besides, it has plenty of funny scenes too. See this movie if you want to experience a roller coaster ride of emotions . At last i say it again, DO NOT MISS THIS ONE."

It will go down in history as one of the most real, and heart touching movies ever:)I couldn't pick a favorite actor in this because they all were amazing! Every actor played their part amazingly. It would not have been the same with different actors. I have never seen a movie where every single part is played with the right emotion. It is one of my all time favorite movies, and i don't think anything could take its place, honestly. Its great for all ages, to parent discretion. I would recommend it to anyone.

","I saw this movie with my daughter when it first came out around Dec. 1999 and then went back to theaters twice more to see it again. I have since watched the video more times than I can remember. I am not a huge Stephen King fan, although I do like some of his works. But this story and movie has become virtually my number one of all-time. The Thomas Newman score is enchanting and I often replay the end credits just to hear his music once more. As someone previously noted, the casting was superb and when you watch other movies with these actors, you will equate and remember that you saw them in the Green Mile. There are scenes that still give me goose-bumps, and scenes that cause me to wipe my eyes afterward, and I am a 69 year old straight male. There is a saying that the time you spend fishing is not counted in your life-span. The same can be said for the times that you watch this movie. Frank Darabont has done a terrific job with the settings in various rooms of E block, just as he did with 'The Shawshank Redemption' completed 5 years earlier. Doug Hutchinson masterfully portrayed a character you immediately grew to despise, and you knew at some later point he would get his just desserts. Sam Rockwell could have also received a supporting actor nomination, as did the late Michael Clarke Duncan. If you have not already seen this movie, I recommended that you rent the DVD so that you can see it without commercial interruption, or editing to fit a time slot on regular TV."
"alishahmohd","10","1","2","25 November 2013"," The Green Mile - Emotional and Mesmerizing
","The Green Mile is a movie based on the Stephan King book by the same name, however unlike some other movies based on his books, not only this is a magnificent movie but the movies stays true to the plot of the novel. <br/><br/>The film moves at a slow pace, but it is still very entertaining to watch from it's beginning to the end, it's plot is also engaging and keeps us interested in finding out what will happen next. While the Green Mile has it's share of amusing scenes, it is a completely serious movie. As a matter of fact emotional might be more accurate. This movie has so many scenes that are just sad and may make you tear up. I try my best not to cry during movies, even during very sad scenes, but I just couldn't control myself while watching the Green Mile, many scenes just touch your heart and the tears will start falling down. The ending was also good but also very sad at the same time, but after this film ended I was simply in awe after watching such a magnificent work of art. The Green Mile is a 3 hours long mesmerizing masterpiece.<br/><br/>The acting is almost perfect almost all actors play their role perfectly, Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan are fantastic in their roles, although i wish Michael got more screen time in the first half of the film. Sam Rockwell and Doug Hutchison play their villainous characters perfectly and really make you want to hate them. The actors who portray the prisoners and show innocence make you feel sympathy for them, like the guards in this movie, and you realize they really do regret what they did, and when they are executed you can't help but feel sad, at least from the inside. But the casting is almost perfect, the actors portray the characters next to perfection, specially Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, as a matter of fact King himself said he had imagined Hanks in the role of Paul Edgecomb.<br/><br/>The music and direction is also brilliant, Frank Darabont did a fantastic job of portraying king's other book into film (ShawShank Redemption) and he continues his success with the Green Mile. He is a magnificent director, I just wish he does more movies based on King's book, because King + Darabont simply results in magic on screen. <br/><br/>While almost perfect, the Green Mile's slow pace, long duration and large amount of emotional scenes do it's replay value no favors, also I find it hard to believe that all prisoners on death row are so civil and nice towards the guards and vice versa, it maybe explained in the book but I find it unrealistic, also the twist that was revealed near the end, in the flashback, just seemed random and ironic, they could have gone in another direction and used another method to bring more light to the truth. Also John Coffey's goes a little out of character in that scene.<br/><br/>Regardless, The Green Mile is mesmerizing and a classic work of art which will make you smile, cry and simply leave you in awe.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9.5/10"

","Presumably on the tide of success of The Shawshank Redemption (1994), the producers decided to bring The Green Mile to the big screen. It used the same prison framework and expanded it with some supernatural elements. Actually, Stephen King did that in his writing which got transfered to the silver screen.<br/><br/>While watching i encountered the same problems as in the other movie which actually stem from the literally template. Writing about supernatural is Stephen King's forte but anything which is even close to portraying actual events feels fake to me. In the same way one wouldn't put an equal sign between a strawberry and a strawberry flavored chewing gum.<br/><br/>The combination of the supernatural and harsh prison reality was interesting to watch, although the former has been obviously not possible and latter fake. In it's ambition to be something of the extraordinary the movie got too long."

","The Green Mile is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a talented cast that all match their characters perfectly. It's a very inspired story that, despite it's length, is very easy to follow, all the characters are developed in a very subtle manner, we are never spoon fed information. I did find the fantasy element a bit forced, it kept the story moving and was quite powerful, but I do not feel like Frank Darabont was able to capture that dramatic effect he was going for, it felt like he was not comfortable with it, making the scenes that showcase Coffey's power seem like they were only there as they were mandatory to the novel. The performances are very powerful, Tom Hanks shines in the lead role, further proving his versatility and likability as an actor, as does Michael Clarke Duncan, portraying a damaged, emotional character to superb effect, certainly the highlight of the late great actors career. Well acted and a really enjoyable story, I would recommend Green Mile to anyone looking for a good drama. <br/><br/>Follows the life of guard Paul Edgecomb, working on death row, who is put in a difficult situation when John Coffey is put into prison, a so called criminal with a heart of gold and a very unusual gift. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Tom Hanks"

"rubenvanbergen","9","1","2","4 January 2013"," Almost perfect
","This film is a testament to everyone involved, as well as to Stephen King's imagination. The performances are excellent and, typical of a Stephen King story, there is some real human drama that drives the story just as much as the more supernatural occurrences. The one problem I had, however, was with the latter. The thing is, most anybody, if they saw something like the events in this movie, would be shaken, to say the least. And not just at the time, but long after, questioning what they saw, if it was real and whether they might be going insane. But that doesn't really seem to happen here. Everybody's reaction to something that by rights ought to be world-shattering is really quite underwhelmed, comparatively anyway. Most of all Paul's wife, who doesn't doubt her husband's story in the slightest, and even starts giving him advice about it as though she were telling him how to ask his boss for a raise.<br/><br/>Of course I understand that the film wouldn't work if you had to show all of the characters reacting realistically and making a big fuss. There wouldn't be time, for one thing. But you'd think they could have reworked the story a bit. Maybe not have Paul tell his wife, for example. Anyway, it's a minor point and it shouldn't spoil this film for you by a long way. But it is the reason - probably the only reason - why I like Frank Darabont's other King adaptation, The Shawshank Redemption, a little bit better still."

","Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at ""the mile"" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.<br/><br/>A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is colored by this. Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan.<br/><br/>It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camera-work is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvelous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation.<br/><br/>All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. 10 out of 10"

No man I could not sleep after watching this movie. The movie starts with John Coffey's arrest. Then it leads to Old Orphanage. Paul (Tom Hanks) is prison guard in the death row. He is the supervisor of all the executions. His assistants are Brutal, Dean, Harry and New guy Percy. Usually the death row is called as ""The Last Mile"" but they call it as ""The Green Mile"". Paul and his team believe in smooth handling of the prisoners but Percy is not like that. He is very aggressive also he is the brotherhood of state government politician. Before every executions Paul will rehearse twice. Mr. Jingler (The mouse) played an important role in this movie. He become pet for one of the prisoner named Eduard Delacroix who is going to die in few days. But Percy wants the front row of the executions. If Paul gives the front row of the executions Percy will quit his job and will join in Mental Hospital supervisor. During Del's execution Percy didn't wet the sponge which should place in the prisoners head. So Del execution went horrible. All were angry with Percy for this. After sometime John cures Paul's urinary infection and saved Mr. Jingler life. So Paul thinks he can cure Hal's (Prison head) wife who is having Brain Tumor. After that John also met his destiny. Then it leads to again the orphanage. Old Paul and his friend Eille went to Mr.Jingler's house (as Paul and Brutal promised to Del the build the House for Mr. Jingler).

","Director Frank Darabont, who made an acclaimed feature film debut with The Shawshank Redemption, based on a Stephen King novel set in a prison, returns for a second feature, based on King's 1996 serialized novel set in a prison in The Green Mile.It was adapted by him from the 1996 Stephen King novel of the same title. The story is told in a flashback format and tells the story of Paul Edgecomb with John Coffey,and his life as a death row corrections officer during the Great Depression in the United States, and the supernatural events he witnessed.The movie stars Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan as Edgecomb and Coffey respectively,and David Morse,Bonnie Hunt and James Cromwell together Michael Jeter, Sam Rockwell, and Graham Greene.<br/><br/>In 1935, inmates at the Cold Mountain Correctional Facility call Death Row ""The Green Mile"" because of the dark green linoleum that tiles the floor. Paul Edgecomb is the head guard on the Green Mile when a new inmate is brought into his custody: John Coffey,convicted of the sadistic murder of two young girls. Despite his size and the fearsome crimes for which he's serving time, Coffey seems to be a kind and well- mannered person who behaves more like an innocent child than a hardened criminal. Soon Edgecomb and two of his fellow guards, Howell, notice something odd about Coffey: he's able to perform what seem to be miracles of healing among his fellow inmates, leading them to wonder just what sort of person he could be, and if he could have committed the crimes with which he was charged.<br/><br/>It was a long film that was a shade under three hours.But that does not mean that it was boring.In fact,it was absorbing and compelling as we get sympathetic to the lead character particularly John Coffey.Also,despite the clichés and stereotypes that characterized this film,the performances of the cast manages to lift it from the depths of the commonplace and make watching it enjoyable.Credit should be given no only to Tom Hanks but also to Michael Clarke Duncan for his honest and sincere portrayal of Coffee,which definitely touches the audience heart and empathy.Also,Darabont once again pleases the viewer with his superb direction just like in The Shawshank Redemption."

","Tom Hanks puts forward another great performance in his acting career. One of his greatest performances since Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan. In this movie, he plays the head prison guard of a death row prison, or the green mile or the mile as the guards call it. It also features the second collaboration with Tom Hanks and Barry Pepper, who is also a pretty good actor. But he did a very terrible job in Battlefield Earth. And the roll of John Coffey played by Michael Clarke Duncan was absolutely amazing, remarkable, breathtaking and very touching. He plays a death row inmate accused of murdering two little girls which he did not do who and he is also very huge and strong and has the mentality of a child. He is basically the guy you would feel sympathy, empathy and compassion for. This is Michael Clarke Duncan's best film role to date. Doug Hutchinson was awesome as Percy, the guard who has no respect and no compassion for the prisoners. He is pretty much the guy who thinks, who cares about the prisoners and has little respect for his colleagues. He is also the guy you would just love to hate. And finally, hands off to James Cromwell as the prison warden. One of his best film performances. The Green Mile is one of the most touching and most gripping movies I have ever seen. Along with the Shawshank Redemption, this is one of the best prison movies ever made."

","I enjoyed Stephen King's serial novel and I enjoyed this as well. Stephen King weaves his best story with The Green Mile. I use to support the death penalty, but my view has changed because of the book series and the movie. Whether they be rapists or killers, they are still people and maybe even with loved ones. The maximum sentence in my opinion should be life in jail. Delacroix did a horrible thing by being a rapist. The movie did an excellent job of making you feel bad for him. His whole demeanor changed and how he acted with the mouse Mr. Jingles was enjoyable to watch. It was easy to feel bad for him when Percy stepped on Mr. Jingles, when Percy told him that Mr. Jingles would not go to a mouse circus when he died like Paul told him, and when Percy botched up his execution. You know what, I really hate Percy. Even though the man with magical powers John Coffey didn't care about being executed even though he never killed and raped the two little girls, I was still sad and I admit that I was crying. Anyone who thinks that males crying is wrong, they must have no heart at all."

""The Green Mile"" puts a supernatural twist on the genre and though it lacks the inspirational kick that allowed ""Shawshank"" to win the hearts of nearly all who've seen it, it holds its own among the many great dramas of the 1990s.<br/><br/>Based on the Stephen King novel, ""The Green Mile"" is a Depression-era film that takes place in a Southern prison on the cell block that houses the criminals awaiting death and ""Old Sparky"" (the electric chair). The ensemble consists of a few of these prisoners and the guards that watch them, led by Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks). The story is partially narrated by the elder version of Edgecomb as he reflects on the strange and life-changing events that occurred in that prison when a large man with mysterious healing abilities named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrived.<br/><br/>Darabont's adaptation is meaty with smooth and effective story arcs and full-bodied characters who feel 100 percent authentic. Just like in ""Shawshank,"" Darabont separates the good guys from the bad guys quickly and they tug at our emotions right away. Doug Hutchison plays the mean-spirited and snotty Percy Wetmore, the one prison guard who's aunt is the governor's wife and tries to use that privilege to behave however he likes. All the other guards (a strong ensemble cast including David Morse and Barry Pepper) treat the prisoners with some humanity, but Percy treats them as if they're the scum of the earth, which easily rattles us. <br/><br/>Darabont asks for a small leap of faith in that we're supposed to pity the prisoners, but considering the flaws of the criminal justice system at the time and excessive and unnecessary use of the death penalty, this is not too difficult. In general, Darabont has the uncanny ability to influence his audience and it's everywhere in ""The Green Mile,"" namely with characters. The introduction of Sam Rockwell's ""Wild Bill"" to the prison is the finest example. He acts catatonic until he gets to the prison and then attacks the guards. From there on out, his subplot is a roller coaster. When he finally gets what he deserves (solitary confinement a couple times) its cathartic for the viewer, but then he's right back at his usual hi-jinx.<br/><br/>Character mastery is the strength of the film, but its weakness is the supernatural element. Considering it takes a long while to enter the picture and everything else feels like authentic historical fiction, John Coffey's healing abilities feel out of place even though they drive the latter half of the film. They're intriguing and add a layer of mystery that certainly complicates matters and when it's used it usually has an impact on the more powerful events of the story (one involving a wonderful little mouse named Mr. Jangles). Yet there's still a continuity issue that just kind of snaps the illusion of the film for a brief moment.<br/><br/>""The Green Mile"" is often considered one of the greatest ""tearjerkers"" of all-time and it certainly warrants that notion whether you cry or not. Rarely does a film pull at your insides like this one, just as it did with ""Shawshank,"" and rarely does a three-hour movie manage to never get boring or talk-heavy. Darabont's excellent script carefully places the turning points of the story to ensure just that.<br/><br/>Here is a film that will radically influence your perceptions of justice. The line between good and evil in this movie is so thick as if suggesting for every definitive good there is in this world there is its equal. Normally we're introduced in film to characters who suggest every person has the capacity for both, but ""The Green Mile"" argues that's not always the case. ""The Green Mile,"" which refers to the green floor of the cell block, symbolizes the path before one is ultimately judged as being one or the other. A tough idea, a powerful idea and one that suits the weighty impact of this film.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","This movie is one of a kind and not what I expected at all when I first picked it up. I guess this is to be expected from Stephen King. I thought it was strange to see ""fantasy"" listed as one of the genres, but there is a reason for it, which I did not expect at all. The story, unlike most, was not predictable and boring, but surprised me at many turns and held me captivated the whole way through. (And I am hard pressed to find a movie that I don't get at least a little bored with after the 2 hr mark.) It's deep, emotional at just the right points, and quite unique. I highly recommend it. This certainly isn't your typical death row movie with a bunch of generic criminals as characters, but much more."

","This, indeed, was the best picture of 1999. Screw American Beauty. It is nothing compared to the Green Mile. It is a rare film made that left me watching through the credits. I mean, it seems like every few years you get a huge handful of good movies, and a huge handful of god awful movies. This is an amazing movie. Handsdown.<br/><br/>The film chronicles the time that Paul Edgecomb spent working at Cold Mountain Penitentiary when John Coffey was there. He was accused of rape and murder of two girls, but Paul is not so sure.<br/><br/>It includes a wonderfully memorable bunch of characters, mine being Eduard Delacroix's, who has one of the best deaths in movie history. Or, as Part 3 of the novel's title ""The Bad Death of Eduard Delacroix""<br/><br/>The film's visuals were haunting. The locusts were creepy and stunning.

","I really can not describe in words how much I love The Green Mile. I only discovered it about 6 months ago and it became my favourite film straight away. This film is sad, funny, intriguing and just absolutely beautiful. I read the book first and was just so amazed at how well it was adapted into the film. Nothing is missed out and I think that every single one of the actors was cast perfectly, particularly Doug Hutchinson as Percy Wetmore who you can't help but hate. I think my favourite thing about The Green Mile is the sound track. The music in the film is just stunning and a few of the songs can bring tears to my eyes without watching the film, just listening. I suppose this film won't appeal to everyone, especially those who find it difficult to concentrate for a long period of time! But for me it's 10 out of 10- a perfect film, I can't fault it."

","I'm not going to make a long review about this movie. Actually, I won't review the movie at all but just simply tell you that it is a must watch for everyone. First of all, for those of you who are not aware of it, the movie is adapted from a book Stephen King wrote...yes, the master of horror himself! I actually read the book when it came out sometime in 1996 and remember not being particularly thrilled by its cover, but as always with King (it was also my first King novel), one page is all it took for me to be sucked in this wonderful story. This is also a movie that stays very true to the book it takes from, book that I recommend thoroughly to anyone as well.<br/><br/>All in all, what you need to know has been said by many other reviewers here so there is no point in me repeating that. The Green Mile will deeply touch you (guaranteed) and it is very likely that the tears will flow at the end of the movie. I know they always do for me, and it's about the 4th time I seen it...if you haven't watched it already, I suggest you stop whatever you're doing and do so right this second! <br/><br/>10/10"

","I remember reading King's novel when it came out in monthly parts, piecework style. It worked well like that.<br/><br/>But it works equally well when taken as a whole, and Frank Darabont's adaptation gives no idea of the fragmented nature of the source material.<br/><br/>Two things come across when revisiting the movie. One is the strength of the ensemble cast - this is a big cast, of performers who are either well established names, or who have made their names since (and perhaps because of) this film. Every part is well cast, and brilliantly performed. I sometimes think you can tell how good a cast is by reference to how much you loathe the baddies, and Doug Hutchison and Sam Rockwell deliver in spades. But every part - down to Bonnie Hunt, Gary Sinise, and King/Darabont regular William Sadler - is simply excellent.<br/><br/>The second thing which comes across is how well constructed the story is. Every single element o the story is essential to it working properly, and the separate parts fit together like a precision watch.<br/><br/>Wonderful stuff."

","In my ""Powder"" review I mentioned the similarities between this movie and Powder where the latter was even written years before this one was released. If you see both movies you will know what I am talking about. The most charming scenes in the Green Mile are taken from Powder. I am sure that all who watched both remembers quite well the scene where Powder makes the guy who hunts the deer feels the pain of the animal. Exactly same scene when Michael Duncan makes the guy who kills the mouse feel its pain. Another similar scene or idea is when Michael Duncan in the ""Green Mile"" heals James Cromwel's ill wife which is taken from Powder who helps the Sheriff's wife to deal with her dying process.<br/><br/>I am not saying that the ""Green Mile"" is not a good movie. On the contrary, I enjoyed it a lot but Powder is a decent one and was made way before the Green Mile so it deserves to be praised being the original at least."

I don't shed a tear watching a movie often but this made me cry pretty bad, it was that moving. With over 3 hrs you would think it was boring but believe me you won't move while watching.

","This is one of my favorite movies because it is a touching and tear jerking . Although it is a heart breaking movie, it also makes you feel warm inside because john Coffey is so innocent. It was a 3 hour long movie, but time flies because it is such a beautiful story. I don't think there were any scenes that could have been deleted in the film. I also thought that the cinematography was great. The director did not use many out standing colors because it is about murder and very dark topics. The only time the director used vivid colors was on the people who were healed from Coffey's treatment. Since the color of the movie was dull, i think the audience did not get distracted and was able to get in to the movie. All the actors fitted in the role; i don't think anyone else could have any of the roles better. Great choice of actors (non famous and famous)."

It's about the life of prison guards that guard the Death Row inmates and the inmates especially John Coffey.

The snotty prison guard is also good because he is annoying in a good way.<br/><br/>This movie won a few, well-deserved Oscars. This movie should have won Best Picture.

","Yes John Coffey You did! One of my favorite movies of all time. On my movie list it tops #1. Being a fan of the movie I have also read the book. Also a great book by Stephen King. Along with being one of my favorite movies the acting was utterly brilliant. Percy is one h-e-l-l of a bad person. When Percy squished Mr. Jingles, I wanted to squish him. A lot of people I talk to say they do not like long movies (by the way the movie is 188-189 Min about 3hrs. and 8-9min). I appreciate them so much. why spend so much to see such a short film. Anyway the movie is also one of the saddest movies I have ever seen. The saddest death, of course, is when John Coffey was put to death. A simple-minded African American wrongfully accused put to death. Another part of the movie that was sad was when Edward Delacroix was killed by Percy Whitmore. The Movie is a great adaption from the novel. Yes the movie is very sad, and I am mad enough to admit it I cried when Edward Delacroix and John Coffey died,(Only a little......). I really recommend this movie to be watched I loved it so much. Also If you like this movie see the other adaption of Stephen King's novelette Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption or just The Shawshank Redemption.(IMDb's #1 movie)."
"zardoz-13","7","1","2","12 September 2008"," ""The Green Mile"" Is A Lemon!
","Stephen King is a good writer, but he isn't one of my favorite authors. Please don't misinterpret my comments about Mr. King. Indisputably, King has a knack for knitting gripping horror yarns, but the warp factor in this fiction dilutes any satisfaction lately that his endings furnish. The twisted nature of good and evil that permeates his plots makes them as lurid as gory car accidents. You don't so much read Stephen King to enjoy a catharsis as you do to experience necrophobia.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont made his Hollywood feature film debut five years ago as the director of ""The Shawshank Redemption."" Derived from a King novella, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" became one of the top-grossing films of 1994, surpassing even ""Pulp Fiction!"" When I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and later raved about it, little did I know that King had a claw in it. Incredibly, Darabont performed a miracle on ""Shawshank"" and King. Not only did he make it palatable, but he also created a classic with a dramatically satisfying resolution. The good guys triumphed, and the bad guys got what they justly deserved! A Stephen King movie that neither grossed me out nor cheated me is an exercise in rare artistry.<br/><br/>Although ""The Green Mile"" shares similarities with ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" the former falls short of the latter. A prison serves as the setting for each movie, and a black man and a white guy form a close relationship. Each film explores the themes of good and evil and the fragility of the human condition. Unlike the thoughtfully-paced and trimly-crafted ""Shawshank,"" Darabont wallows indulgently in King's source material. King readers will applaud the reverence that Darabont lavishes on the literary master of the macabre. Nevertheless, ""The Green Mile"" is a lemon that wears out its welcome long before it ends. Despite a terrific cast and its atmospheric production values, ""The Green Mile"" is far too long, far too loquacious, and far too morbid. While this death row drama succeeds as an above-average character study, ""The Green Mile"" could have been improved had Darabont left half of it on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>Not only did Darabont direct ""The Green Mile,"" but he also penned the screenplay. Unimaginatively, he drags out everything ad nauseam. ""The Green Mile"" clocks in at an appalling 187 minutes! Moreover, those three hours and seven minutes lack velocity. The initial 45 minutes elapse without complication, but the remaining 142 minutes lurch about in fits and starts. You'll be checking your watch at the two hour mark and wondering why the film has not made greater progress. Darabont dramatizes so much questionable material that he doesn't have time to accelerate either the momentum or urgency.<br/><br/>Eventually, the shopworn plotting degenerates so much that you want to fast forward through those scenes that clog up the action. Darabont seems lost himself. ""The Green Mile"" circles rather than moves in a straight line. He resorts to standard symbolic clichÃ©s, such as John Coffey's initials. Moreover, Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan of ""Armageddon) acts a Christ figure of sorts, because he was unfairly imprisoned for crimes he did not commit. When Coffey heals one guard and resurrects an animal, the comparison between Christ and Coffy is blatant. Movie rule #1: Animals must never die! Later, Coffey passes along part of his powers to Edgcomb whose first name was Paul. Catch the religious significance? The realism clashes unevenly with the fantasy. The ""Hogan's Heroes"" antics are entertaining, but too much time is wasted on other characters that add nothing to the plot. Darabont directs as if he were watching a mini-series.<br/><br/>Indeed, ""The Green Mile"" boasts some powerfully emotional scenes, but the misguided scenes outnumber them. While confined largely to death row, ""The Green Mile"" sprawls with considerable ethos, passion, and scope. Darabont weaves elements from ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" (1962), ""Powder"" (1995), and ""E.T: The Extraterrestrial"" (1982). Darabont relates the story in one marathon flashback. Since Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks of ""Forrest Gump"") never faces death, the flashback proves an acceptable storytelling device rather than anti-climactic, as it would be in lesser films where the hero appears in constant jeopardy. Edgecomb lives in a retirement home when we see him at first. He attends a screening of the Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers' musical ""Top Hat"" (1935) in the facility. The memories that ""Top Hat"" triggers sends Edgecomb out of the room in tears. A lady friend rushes to Paul's side, and he regales her with his exploits as a prison guard in the 1930s.<br/><br/>Characters with depth and strength walk ""The Green Mile."" The action unfolds during the Great Depression in 1935 at Louisiana's Cold Mountain Prison where a gigantic ""Of Mice and Men"" type African-American itinerant receives the death penalty for killing two little white girls. As the Chief of Guards on Death Row, Paul Edgecomb treats the inmates with respect and dignity. He supervises the arrival of John Coffey in E-Block. Coffey towers like Goliath over Edgecomb and his crew of guards, and he has to bend over to enter his cell. During Coffey's sojourn at Cold Mountain, Edgecomb discovers the miracles can occur in the most unlikely places.<br/><br/>Sadly, the unsavory moments in ""The Green Mile"" sabotage the memorable ones. Occasionally, you may even feel a mite green around the gills. The squeamish should look the other way during the electrocution scenes, especially when Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter of ""True Crime"") dies in the chair. Of course, no American movie about life-behind-bars could resist commentary on capital punishment. Indeed, prison movies often qualify as thinly-veiled polemics against the death penalty. Clearly, the people at Warner Brothers who made ""The Green Mile"" deplore the death penalty, but they relish poetic justice. At the last minute, The Green Mile"" wades a little too deeply into the philosophical quagmire with its revelations about the protagonist. Altogether, the audience doesn't get any time off for good behavior."
"dshark87","Null","1","2","13 March 2008"," The Green Mile, a comment on the film.
","""The Green mile"" is a cell block for death row inmates, named such because the floor was the color of faded limes. It's the setting of the story of John Coffey, an innocent angel, come to us as a very large, imposing black man with a shy, child like personality, who is wrongly accused of murdering two little girls and sent off to be executed on death row. <br/><br/>With Coffey's power to 'take things back' or heal living things, Coffey tried to save two dying little girls, who were beyond help when he came upon them. Coffey ended up being accused of their murder by an unknowing, angry mob. <br/><br/>The girls were murdered by Billy the Kid, who worked as a laborer for the father of the girls for a brief spell before ending up as another inmate on the Green Mile, for another, equally heinous crime of murdering a pregnant woman and her family.<br/><br/>Billy the Kid is a force of wickedness, counter to Jon Coffey in the world.<br/><br/>On the Mile, there are some interesting characters, like Delacroix, an inmate that befriends a mouse, who accidentally stumbles on the fountain of youth, via John Coffey. There is the child of privilege, in the evil Percy Whitmore, a prison guard who stands as a contrast to the lead characters of higher moral esteem.<br/><br/>Brutus Howell (David Morse) and Boss Paul Edgecomb(Tom Hanks) play two guards at the prison. They are regular guys who have an almost cold sense of decency...which make them the perfect vehicle for the viewer to see the story through. The relationship between Hanks and Duncan is like, 'man meets angel.' <br/><br/>'There are good people in this bad world'...is the thought I walked away thinking after seeing this charming, funny and sometimes painful, yet beautiful film, for like, the 6th time since its release in 1999.<br/><br/>Fantastic spiritual journey this movie is. Mystical, sad, funny, joyful, evil, the whole ball of wax wrapped up in a three hour film worthy of discussion among all those who seek truth or just speculate on what constitutes our human notions of our values. <br/><br/>There is another movie called ""Defending Your Life,"" (with Meryll Streep and Albert Brooks) where the premise was that when you die, you go to a way station, where it is decided whether you 'move forward' or go 'back' based on whether you rose above fear in your life. If you were fearless and good, you moved forward. If your life was dictated by fear, you went back and tried it again on Earth.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Jon Coffey was afraid of the dark."

","""When I stand before God awaiting judgment and he asks me why I let one of His greatest miracles die, what am I gonna say???? that it was my job?"" The Green Mile is not a movie for those looking to fill a couple of hours in meaningless, mindless entertainment. The fireworks and special effects here are scene enhancing, and not the main attraction.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a novel by Stephen King (Who also wrote The Shawshank Redemption). While I have not read the novel by King, the movie introduces a fantastical element that ordinarily we wouldn't believe. I believe this film is not a study into miracles, although they occur. It is a study into the meaning of capital punishment and what it means to face death and life with complete knowledge. Choices must be made, sometimes, that stay with us for the rest of our lives. This film leads us through our own experiences and feelings on our own choices.<br/><br/>The film appears to begin at the end. Death row, the green mile, Old Smokey, cells filled with men who have been convicted of horrible crimes and are confined here waiting the unavoidable conclusion. It is quite clear that some are guilty and they inspire our feelings of justice. It is clear as well. However, that others may or may not be guilty and inspire in us only pity or sorrow or compassion. It is human, all of it. Sick, well, giant, mousey. Good and evil. If you let it, it will make you think and it may even change your life.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks shows once again why he is arguably the most celebrated actor of all times. Hanks tells his saga as an old man. Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb who is the chief guard in Louisiana State Prison's death row. Part of his job is to supervise the executions of the prisoners waiting to walk ""the last mile"", in this case called the ""green mile"" because of the lime green tiles that cover the floor of the prison. I hate people who give away too much of a movie in reviews so I never do that in my reviews and in this case I am tempted to tell you more but I feel those of you who haven't seen it I'll be spoiling it all for you....<br/><br/>I have been inspired by movies in my life, but this is the first movie that I have watched where when the credits rolled I had an immediate insight into my own spiritual existence. This movie will make viewers think about their attitudes, spiritual integrity, and overall meaning for existence.<br/><br/>Also be prepared for graphic death scenes, racial hate, moderate depictions of violence against children, slight foul language and no ""everybody lives happily ever after"" ending. Some do, some don't. That's life."

Stephen King has done a great job once again. Although a lot of the actors weren't big-name actors (except Tom Hanks of course), I still enjoyed their performances (when I name the movies in here it's only the films I had seen them in). Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, Saving Private Ryan, Road to Perdition) was great as Paul Edgecomb, I don't think John Travolta would have pulled it off as well (They were originally going to cast Travolta as Edgecomb instead of Tom Hanks). Michael Clarke Duncan (Armageddon, Daredevil, Sin City) gave probably his best performance as the miracle-making giant, John Coffey. Barry Pepper (Saving Private Ryan, 61*, We Were Soldiers) was probably my favorite guard, Dean Stanton. He just seemed to have more depth than some of the others. Michael Jeter (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Jurassic Park III) was cast as Eduard ""Del"" Delacroix, who was actually probably my favorite character. Some of the scenes in this movie were difficult to watch, and Percy the guard, and Wild Bill Wharton were the most annoying characters I've seen in a while. But, this movie was still great.

American actors not from the South almost always get them wrong and British actors do so much better at the Southern accent. Maybe some linguist can explain this phenomenon.

a cold calculating imposition as to the state and its mandate to execute these individual's whom it has deemed worthy of dying for there crimes against society.There is also no redeeming quality in there sentencing as both the law as well as the state provide and in fact by virtue of the film itself deny the existence of a supra-natural creator.There is no hope in this film,only the death that it solemnly moves toward.There is a terrible mistake that audiences make when they see a film like this and that is to judge it as to society and the system which rules as possessing any moral belief in God or even of Salvation.This film is a very clear predetermined denial of the existence of Miracles and as well that a God in Heaven exists,or has ever existed.The inability of the films underpinning to provide a belief in the innocence of the character named Coffe-is so cold and even bastardly that this is thought to be the law when in fact it represents the getting of ones way and further it represents through the conduct of its officials,from rookie cop to prison warden the desire to maintain the status quo.The revelation late into the film of the real killers identity should of provided at least some effort to see that an innocent man does not die for a crime that he did not commit.One of the reasons that he did go to the electric chair was because he was the one they chose and come hell or high water he's the one there going to fry.The idea that he fell out of the sky as like a patsy was made very evident by the attorney who represented him.What suggested is that when the law says its got its man it means it.If the viewer wishes to include some ideas about racism I too will not ignore it because there are simply to many stories about the perils of this life not to listen to the evidence.However this is not the end to this story about the world we live in,it provides only the sure thing that any who find there way to death row will most surely die.This film provides a problem and that we as a culture live in a world that is ruled over by a system as well run by Laws and the people it employs to enforce those laws.There are a couple of areas that are worth mentioning,it is this reviewers opinion that one of the attractions of the film is of the emotional content which is exemplified by the miracles witnessed by these officials.The Hanks ordeal is real enough however it is the Wardens wife who believes and in fact provides a witness that is indeed a very worthy chapter in this movie presentation.The makers of this film were very conscious of appearances where we see the wife upon Coffey entrance into her room and the subtle attempts to alter her appearance without changing the scene.The not spoken of up to this point is Mr. Jingles and though this may in fact provide for amusement it is deadly serious.This film made certain that it was not stated out right lest it be against the law however even as of just a couple of days ago-appearing in the New York Times(this day being-Dec.12,2004)there was a graph of the percentage of DNA that is possessed by other species not being human.The mouse then and even now is recognised as having the highest percent of DNA seen to be exactly the same as the human being,that being 55%.What does that mean?it provides for the fact that there is no belief in the existence of Devine Creation and that the human kind literally evolves from the likes of a lower order of life.This film is more deadly then a bullet because its underpinnings are understated and not immediately perceived by there audience.The introduction to the film and as well the end to the film are in fact the answers and seem at first incongruent with the telling of this tale.What answers-The impossible idea of the existence of Mr.Jingles just so in that cabinet-it is so convenient not to be taken seriously and though the old guy is older its not a worthy thought of him being as old as he suggests.If I remember he suggests something in the hundreds and so on,however it to me is not to be believed in and it would seem that in fact there is an admission of actually trying to steal the thunder of Gods Mercy through the carrying out of the orders to execute Coffe.These are unjust and unfriendly neighbors and never the Twain shall meet.What we are asked as of all things to believe in, is Christian in its precept and yet does nothing to assuaged the heart of the human kind as to the very deadly and dangerous purpose had by this overseer as well by its system.When you play with reality this is the kind of review you get and I promise you there is a-lot more where this came from.This film is about stealing the life from the heart of the human kind and though not being of itself particularly inspiring it is also provides for a look see as to what was being stolen if not the heart of the matter and that might be the opportunity to do so-I think we are in fact looking at the profit motive and how deadly serious it is with reality in tow to get its way-This is not recommended viewing and in fact is a UN-American film."

","I love this movie. Every time i watch it I find something else that I love about it. The acting in it is amazing!! Beautifully done. Even though all the actors were superb, I just want to comment on my favourites: David Morse - I thought he was fantastic. He was my favourite character. I was a bit annoyed that they down played his role a bit - in the book, his role was more prominent. Michael Clarke Duncan - he blew me away. It was as if the character was written with him in mind. Doug Hutchison - he was great as Percy, a character you loved to hate. Michael Jeter - he was very good. He played Del so well. Overall, this is just such a fantastic movie. I recommend it to everyone. 10/10."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Stephen King is one of the greatest Horror writers of all time. With stories like ""The Shining"", he has become categorically associated with the spine chilling. Ironically however, he is responsible for two films which are not as much spine chilling as moving and to a degree inspiring. The first of these is 1994's ""Shawshank Redemption"" and the other is 1999's ""The Green Mile"".<br/><br/>Staring Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, ""The Green Mile"" is the story of a prison during the depression. In charge of the Electric Chair, Paul Edgecomb (Hanks) and his group of guards, run a tight operation where often the guards have a close relationship with their prisoners. One day a prisoner is sent to them in the form of the gigantic John Coffey (Clarke Duncan). Coffey is sentenced to death for the brutal murder of two young girls, but as the guards begin to interact with Coffey, they begin to realise he isn't quite what he seems.<br/><br/>With multi-Oscar winner Tom Hanks in the leading role, King and director Frank Darabont, have chosen a well seasoned professional who can put in the outstanding performance often needed. In ""The Green Mile"" however, Hanks is outperformed by the surprising Michael Clarke Duncan. Used to more blockbuster based roles (1998's ""Armageddon"" and 2003's ""Daredevil"" for example), Clarke Duncan shines as the sweet giant with a heart of gold. Worthy of his nomination for best supporting actor at the Oscars, it took a questionable win for Michael Caine for him to not win.<br/><br/>Aside from Hanks and Clarke Duncan, the remainder of the cast provide equally sound performances. Patricia Clarkson is perhaps underused, whilst Sam Rockwell is perhaps overused, but all in all, the cast perform effectively.<br/><br/>""The Green Mile"" is a brilliant film. It's perhaps slightly too long, running in at a hefty three hours, but the majority of it runs smoothly and effectively. It might not be as good as films like ""The Godfather"" (1972) or ""Casablanca"" (1942), but it's definately a film which everyone should watch. It's a film which inspires us to think, and simultaneously causes us to shed a tear. Three hours it might be, but make the effort and you won't be disappointed."

","So far this is the best movie I've ever seen! I just don't get it - where was I earlier? Anyway, the emotions in it are almost too much to handle. The proportions of the reality and the fantasy are perfect cause you don't feel like watching a Sci-Fi movie. I'm a big believer, so for me this movie was perfect cause I believe that in a thousand or whatever big number of years, this could happen. Miracles do happen, although we do live in a time where we only trust our computers and stuff like that. The movie doesn't stop to carry you away till the very last minute of it and that is something which is quiet rare for movies. For the poor people who haven't seen it(hopefully, yet): If you want to see a more than just a perfect movie and a great team of actors, then this is for you!"
"NoArrow","Null","1","2","3 April 2004"," Makes you want to cry, makes you want to laugh, makes you want to smile, one of the greatest!
","""The Green Mile"" should be in the thesaurus as a synonym for ""amazing"".  The story it tells is one of the saddest, heartwarming, most brilliant ever told (and I don't mean just in movies).  Everything about this movie is perfect, it literally has no flaws.  Yes, some may complain about the running time, but anything shorter wouldn't have been able to tell the story right. Truly, I doubt anyone could put up a good argument that this isn't a terrific film.<br/><br/>The [brilliant] story focuses on death row guard Paul (Tom Hanks) and how he copes with his job - executing the inmates.  Everything is regular until gentle giant John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives with a death sentence for the rape and murder of two little girls.  Coffey is an unlikely pedophile/killer - he's afraid of the dark, he cries in his sleep, he speaks with an innocence as if he's never come in real contact with a person before.  Seeing this, Paul starts to question whether or not Coffey committed the crime he was sentenced with.<br/><br/>Paul is also suffering from a bladder infection, one day, when its really bad, Coffey grabs him, touches him, and then he's healed!  He does the same for a pet mouse crushed by the villain Percy (Doug Hutchison).  It is thought that maybe Coffey was trying to heal the two dead girls he was found with.<br/><br/>And so starts this great, great film.  Every cast member puts forth.  There are some great side performances from Michael Jeter, David Morse and Patricia Clarkson - but don't get me wrong, there isn't one bad performance in this movie.<br/><br/>Of course, the greatest comes from Duncan, playing a sad, hulking simpleton often drenched in his own tears.  This is the performance of a lifetime for Duncan - who is now unfortunately wasting his talent on ""Daredevil"" and ""See Spot Run"".  He was nominated for an Oscar for this film, but Michael Caine beat him.  This is an outrage, Caine always plays the sympathetic British guy.  Duncan's performance is one of the greatest I've ever seen.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the most touching, sad movies I've ever seen, watch it, 9/10."
"hokiemo","Null","1","2","18 March 2004"," Deeply moving film worth watching
","This movie makes you wonder how many innocent people have been executed.  I found strong religious symbolism in John Coffey to Jesus Christ in that Jesus performed miracles and he too was put to death despite his peaceful and innocent nature.  I do believe images from the movie will stay with you long after, but not in a bad way.  I didn't think the movie pushed a viewpoint regarding death row convictions in one direction or the other, but just made you think about the judicial system.  Maybe DNA testing would have freed John Coffey if the year was 2004, but I think he would have been implicated in some way, maybe as an accomplice, since people judge each other based on appearances.  There was one very nasty character in the movie who most people would agree deserved death row. But of course, is the satisfaction of putting down the vile murderers of the world worth the life of even 1 innocent person?  What if that innocent person was you?"
"trouserpress","7","1","2","13 February 2004"," I have the solution! (Major Spoilers ahead!!)
","Okay, so it was a nice film and all that, but I can't enjoy it now because I've seen such an obvious solution to their problem that now it just bugs me that they didn't do it. Don't read this if you don't want the plot revealed to you - <br/><br/><br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT)<br/><br/><br/><br/>John Coffey showed Paul that it was Wild Bill that killed the little girls, and that is why he turned Percy Wetmore (quite a funny name, which I'm sure was done on purpose) into a vegetable, who in turn shot Wild Bill. Paul then had to explain that Percy just went nuts, and this was in no way connected to John Coffey's magic powers. Later on he can't decide what he is going to do about John's execution, so they end up putting him in the chair.<br/><br/>So here's what he should have done: Told the warden that Wild Bill confessed to killing the two girls, and Percy in his loony state shot him in disgust. Therefore John is innocent, and they have four witnesses to back up the story, so they can let John go. He can then live forever with Paul and the mouse and no one needs to ride the lightening.<br/><br/>Simple huh?<br/><br/>
(END OF SPOILERS)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Leaving all that aside for a moment, The Green Mile is still a good film, but I don't think it's good enough to be in the top 250. The main problem is that there are two films in there- a top notch prison drama and a supernatural thriller. For me the two elements just didn't gel together to make one good film. The use of CGI jarred with the 1930's setting. They could still have had this guy with powers but I think it would have worked better if more was left to the imagination, not CGI lights and magic flies. This kind of thing probably read well in the book, but there are some things you should definitely leave out of Stephen King adaptations."

","Very disappointing.  Beware:  other than the prison setting, this WAY overlong production veers left center from its director's ""crisp to perfection"" previous effort of Shawshank Redemption.  The Green Mile is gasically a live action cartoon from wooden one-dimensional performances. Hank's Goody-Two-Shoes guard and Duncan's wrongly accused Stepnfetch gentle giant were especially excruiating to watch.   Then there are the Spielbergesque 'pickups' (let's just count how many times one can bear to watch a mouse scamper across a floor) and plot lines that can be seen from forever (""inoperable tumor bad/must come out"").  When o when will filmmakers learn that the brilliant imagingings of Stephen King's mind simply cannot be filmed?  Satisfying for the masses I'm sure.  However as a staunch death penalty opponent, the only thing good I can say about this film is that the execution scenes were realistic enough to sour anyone to that ideal - except that alas they don't use the chair anymore."

I watched ""The Green Mile"" first, and although I feel that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the greater movie, ""The Green Mile"" is an outstanding movie in its own right.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont shows why he is one of the best screenplay writers/directors with this movie.  Despite being over 3 hours long, this was a movie that constantly kept your attention.  Tom Hanks, as always, gives an outstanding performance, but the real star is Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey (""same name as the drink but spelt not the same"").  David Morse, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, Michael Jeter, Barry Pepper, Patricia Clarkson, and even Gary Sinise and William Sadler (who also with Jeffrey DeMunn appeared in Darabont's other classic film, ""The Shawshank Redemption"") in bit roles give memorable performances as does Doug Hutchison who plays the weasel, Percy.<br/><br/>Yes, it has more ""fantasy"" elements to it than ""The Shawshank Redemption"", but it is based on a Stephen King work.  And as much as I loved Shawshank, ""The Green Mile"" is DEFINITELY the sadder movie.

Now THAT'S entertainment, Frank!<br/><br/>Last Sunday, years later, I got to tune in and pick up where I'd left off, and having seen the whole movie, I think that mid-movie execution scene to be even more misconceived, in what is an otherwise entertaining movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS APPROACHING<br/><br/>There is too much implausibility here though, even for a fantasy flick: the ease with which they smuggle Coffey out, for one thing, the general saintliness of one and all, for another, the fact that they can show Coffey a 'flickershow' inside the prison, without notice or preparation, as soon as he asks to see one, and so on and on.<br/><br/>The end is worth waiting for, but the final line is a little ironic after 3 hours plus: ""the green mile can be awfully long"".

","I have resisted seeing this movie because of all the hype, but am glad I finally watched it - as it is far better than I expected.<br/><br/>This is the first Tom Hanks movie, where I forgot who he is and became immersed in the character. I think this is his best performance ever, but it was eclipsed by those of Sam Rockwell as  Wild Bill and Michael Clark Duncan as John Coffey. Duncan's performance in particular was one of the most gripping I have ever seen in many years of movie going. There really was not a wrong note in the casting and all performances were far above average. The only possible miscasting was Dabs Greer as the Old Paul Edgecomb - surely there was someone available who looked a bit more like Tom Hanks?<br/><br/>As with all Stephen King stories there are no shades of grey in the characters, they are all either good or bad and we are made sure of that right from the start.  This, particularly in a movie of such great length does pall somewhat, but the story gripped right to the end and there is lttle that could be left out.<br/><br/>It is necessary in a story such as this to suspend disbelief, but then this is so with virtually all of King's stories.

","""The Green Mile"" is the second adaption of a Stephen King jail house drama after ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994), both being directed by Frank Darabort. Tom Hanks in one his best roles plays a jail house office in the ""Green Mile"", the death row of a Lousiana country prison in 1935. When the tall black prisoner John Coffey arrives, being sentenced to death because of a double child murder), nothing will be the same. John appears as a simple-minded, but jesus-like faith healer, laying his hands on aching scrotums, trampled mice and maniac housewives and healing them within a few seconds only. While Hanks and his colleagues become aware of John's abilities and innocence, the sadistic rookie Percy Wetmore brings violence, hate and destruction into the small world of the ""Green Mile"".<br/><br/>This is not just another prison movie, but one of the most touching statements about love and violence, life and death, belief and disbelief, and finally about humanity and against the death penalty filmed during the last few years. The jail house wardens celebrate a row of executions - one becoming a painful torture to the victim and the audience after an act of sabotage by officer Percy - like a ritual, switching off their personal feelings. In the end they have to execute John, and even if they all now that he's innocent they can't stop his fatal walk to the electric chair... the film ends with one of the most touching finals of the movie world during the last few years!<br/><br/>The complete cast in this stunning drama is brilliant, especially Tom Hanks, his colleagues and the death row inmates. The most stunning roles of all is played by Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, not speaking or moving much, but with an instant expression of pain and suffering on his face that won't let you untouched. <br/><br/>The whole atmosphere, especially in the Green Mile settings and the execution chamber, are touching, depressing and fascinating at the same time. There's a fine and minimal score by Thomas Newman and some lovely filmed tricks with a  mouse who becomes a big attraction in this small world of death and suffering. Even if Darabont/King use some standard elements of fantasy/horror movies like Tom inhaling the evil and sickness from other people with a light stream, it never becomes kitschy or unbelievable. Watch this great movie!!!!"

"mtac877824","Null","1","2","9 November 2002"," The Green Mile creates Miracles..Hanks best work yet
","How to sum up the single best movie Tom Hanks has made to date? It is not possible to comment on this movie and give it the justice it deserves. It's too good and too intertwined to comment on it in just a few words. Although it is his best work, Hanks (""Boss"") supporting cast enhances Hanks' own heart-wrenching performance and unique view of the Green Mile. Who can ever forget ""walking the mile, walking the Green Mile"" uttered repeatedly by Harry Dean Stanton in a comic turn as a trustee. The Green Mile is rich in dialogue, location and casting with Oscar worthy performances by every single actor that puts the viewer not just on the Mile but with each person on the Mile. Uniquely original and uniquely wonderful while  heartbreaking is what The Green Mile is.  Miracles happen.  Even in the death-row cellblock at Cold Mountain Penitentiary.  John Coffeey (like the drink but spelled different) played by Michael Clarke Duncan (who was nominated for an Oscar for his incredible role) is a gentle giant of a prisoner with supernatural powers and brings a sense of spirit and humanity to his guards and fellow inmates, as well as his incredible ability to create divine miracles in the least likely place--The Green Mile. It's a stellar ensemble cast that brings the Stephen King novel by the same name, to real life.    Notable scene stealers are Mr Jingles, the incredible mouse that befriends a cajun inmate on the green mile and Edward, the resident cajun on the Green Mile.    Sam Rockwell as the disgusting and vile ""Billy the Kid"" and Michael Jeter as the cajun inmate show just how good they are at their craft. Harry Dean Stanton, mentioned above, gives us some needed humor as the trustee who allows the guards to practice on him in getting ""Old Sparky"" ready when the day is near for one of the inmates to pay the ultimate price for their crimes.  Just who Coffeey pays the ultimate price FOR is revealed midway through the movie, and it evokes a sadness that few movies have ever been able to do so convincingly. James Cromwell plays a grim but fair role as the sad, convincing and big-hearted warden whose wife plays a key role in the Green Mile and in Coffey's ""miracle gifts"".   David Morse, as ""Brutal"" may be a big man but his heart is bigger and you find yourself wishing you knew these caring men who have the hardest jobs in the country in the 1930's.    In the middle of all the activity on the Green Mile, is John Coffey,(SPOILER) convicted of a crime he didn't commit and knowing his soul is at stake, Hanks must carry out his duty as the ""Boss"" on the Green Mile and goes to Coffeey to ask a life altering question- listen closely to the answer; and then lives long enough to grieve for Coffey-- years later. <br/><br/>   Watch for Mr. Jingles to make his incredible second appearance toward the end.  Fred Astaire's ""I'm in Heaven""song has an incredibly different meaning on the Green Mile.   While you will be annoyed and disgusted with ""Percy"", he gets his come uppance (SPOILER) at the end. ""What happens on the Mile, stays on the Mile."" This movie has the best ensemble cast in the history of Hanks's impressive career. John Coffey's gift's keep giving long after Coffeey, weary of all the pain he says he feels from everyone, pays the ultimate debt he did not owe.   Barry Pepper (""Battlefield Earth"" and ""Saving Pvt. Ryan"") also turns in a deft and heart-warming portrayal of yet another guard on the mile with a heart of gold. Once again, you will find yourself wishing you knew these wonderful and wise men. It is a running theme throughout the movie that all people, regardless of what you might think of them, deserve courtesy and humane treatment.  A better group of actor's have not graced the silver screen than this one.<br/><br/> Miracles DO happen and the Green Mile is proof. If you never see another movie, see this one.  It might just change how you look at each other. Stellar!!  Unquestionably the best picture of the year."

Everything that is so beautiful, is also ugly in the same time.But what can we do if you have to execute one of God's miracles? What can you do? It's a situation, which most of us don't want to share a thought.And yet,Paul had to.And...he did he's job,because it was the best thing to do,not because he wanted. And it is incredible that people can be so mean,because they don't know, and can't see the truth. In a strange way John Coffey has similarities with the well known ring(LOTR).If evil can hide in the smallest things,then Good can also hide in the most unexpected beings,like John Coffey.

But this film certainly changed my mind... Here unfolds the true mastery of developing a whole 3-hour long story on a 100 square feet scene! I don't know if it was just me, but I filled two handkerchiefs while watching the movie! ;) All the characters are so alive and emotionally rich, that... it is really unbelievably believable!"

Directed to perfection by Frank Darabont, superbly acted by an ensemble cast and with an original story by Stephen King and Frank Darabont, this is as good as it gets at the movies.  I won't make the often-stated claim that ""this is the best movie of all time"" or even the best film I've ever seen, but it manages to deal with real spiritual and existential issues as meaningful as life and death, pain and suffering, and ""sin"" and ""retribution"" in a way I've rarely had the privilege of seeing on film, and manages to entertain to the max as well (if you liked it, try ""Dead Man Walking"" as well).

Michael Clark Duncan really steals the show as the huge, softspoken, and kindly John Coffey. He was nominated for best supporting actor, and should have received it. Doug Hutchison has one of the most difficult parts as Percy Whetmore. He does a magnificent job with the role. John Coffey arrives on death row at Cold Mountain Prison in 1935, accused of killing two young girls. As it turns out, he is completely innocent, but prefers to go to his death anyway. Paul is suffering with a painful infection that John eventually cures him of.Del (Michael Jeter) is another prisoner slated to die in the electric chair who befriends a mouse named ""Mr. Jingles"". Percy deliberately kills the mouse, and John brings it back to life, giving witness to his great healing powers. Percy is a spoiled brat, with connections to the governor. He uses this to more or less throw his weight around with the other guards, but gets his in the end. He should have taken that job at the mental institution.

","As in the ""Shawshank Redemption,"" Frank Darabont creates another brilliant transformation of a Stephen King novel onto the big screen with an award nominating success.  Although ""The Green Mile"" is three hours long, it is a film with complete character development. John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), the murderer of two sisters, utters one of the taglines from this film when the posse confronts him. Coffey declares that ""I tried to take it back, Boss but it was too late"". John makes the same remark to Paul Edgecombe (Tom Hanks), the supervisor ""Boss"" of death row, thus giving him a ""touch"" of the truth. This tagline was a double-edged sword which Darabont honed to perfection.  Not only was this comment mistaken as a confession, but also judged by the system to warrant the death penalty.  Innocence was realized by Paul through John's gift: A touch of life.  Paul was faced with a moral dilemma of knowing the truth,, but having to put John to death.  Paul asks John, ""What am I supposed to say when I stand before God on my judgement day and He asks why I killed a miracle of His.  That it was my job.""  The irony is compounded when we learn that a gift is not always a blessing."

It took me several hours to recover from watching this because of the emotional upheaval which one must go through watching this film.  It is not fluff, it is not light hearted entertainment it is a soul searching, defining moment in film that will not be equaled for a long time.  One piece of advice, do not watch this movie if you have something else you must be doing, don't get up to get a drink, don't read the newspaper, make sure you have 3 hours to dedicate to watching this masterpiece.

When they made it into a movie, I like some other reviewers here, was hesitant about it being any good, seeing as how most King books don't turn into movies all that well, with the exceptions of a couple.

Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecome was an excellent choice, as was David Morse whom portrayed Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell. Morse is the tall/quiet sidekick to Hanks in this movie, and he shows true restraint by not beating the pain in the butt, Percy Wetmore, (Doug Hutchinson) to death!  (At times I wish he would have!)  I have watched this movie many times and it is always as gripping as the first time.<br/><br/>The story timeline is excellently written and scripted.  I personally could have lived without all the 'at home' scenes with Paul and Jan Edgecomb, as there were many.  Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey was unbelevable. What a superb actor!  He is that gentle giant that everyone wants to stand back in awe, yet hug at the same time.  The emotional scene where Paul has to make that final decision of 'pulling the switch' (or ""Roll on 2"") on John is almost choking.  That whole scene grabs you by the throat and does not let go until after the final decision is made.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.  Albeit 3 hours long, I have YET to sit through it and ever once look at my watch.  SUPERB ENTERTAINMENT!!!"
"evilmatt-3","7","1","2","12 December 1999"," Good, but let's not go overboard
","I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  The acting and story were both much better than I thought they would be.<br/><br/>However, I do not really agree with the view that Oscars should immediately rain down upon this for a few reasons.  First, the screenplay, while certainly entertaining, has all the originality of a Disney script.  This is not to say it's bad; I just thought the movie was extremely predictable. In places, it even lapses into cliché.<br/><br/>Second, while Tom Hanks and company do a fine job of acting, none of the roles were particularly difficult to play.  All of the characters (with the possible exception of John Coffey) were extremely one dimensional.  Half an hour into the movie I knew how each of them would handle just about any situation-- there was none of that ambiguity or uncertainty that can make a character not just an image but an extension of the audience.<br/><br/>Finally, the directing is also good, but not spectacular.  While this movie script may be more challenging than most to shoot well, I think our director again lapsed into clichés with some of the screen shots (for a good example, pick any of the bird's eye view shots with the camera slowly moving up. Apparently the director is fond of these, as he also was liberal with them in The Shawshank Redemption.)<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good, entertaining movie, but if you want an Oscar winner, walk over to the next screen and see Being John Malkovich or American Beauty."

What is great about on the whole for this film is the character development.  I could comment on the actors whose names I can't remember, but Michael Clarke Duncan gives one of the most sympathetic performances in film I have seen. It is his performance which, ashamedly, brought this 18 year old male to tears, which is a hard task indeed.  The only thing wrong with this film, is the 3 hour time limit.  Simply put, the first hour is quite slow and drags on, but the last 2 hours gave everlasting questions about the world and life, forever on my mind.<br/><br/>From what I've heard, this movie is from the writer/director of ""The Shawshank Redemption"", which I've heard is a far superior film, which if true, I must see. 9/10"

After one of the inmates demonstrated the gift of healing, it became especially tough to have to carry out the death penalty on John Coffey, the giant black man.  Was there another way?  After Coffey had performed several miracles, Paul Edgecomb began to suspect that this man was not both a healer and a killer that God would not give the gift of healing to a murderer.<br/><br/>The Green Mile got me thinking about the lack of justice in our world today and wondering how often people have been wrongly convicted or died for crimes they didn't do?

","(POSSIBLE SPOILER)<br/><br/>I'd cautiously recommend this film to someone who's read the book, preferably more than once; if you see the movie first you're settling for a flattened-out version of the original with an unforgiveably hokey change in the ending. The acting and set I'd give an A++ to, the casting maybe a B (was Harry really that old? he was supposed to be a rookie!) but the treatment of the story itself I found very disappointing, particularly when I'd been told how faithful the movie was to the book.<br/><br/>A big problem was the cutting of the present-day section of the book, which makes it clear that this story is a memoir this 104-year-old man is writing in an effort to come to terms with his past. Some of the aspects that bothered people in the movie, such as the prison guard characters being so enlightened about race or the main character's wife being so perfect, weren't such a problem in the book as these were all being seen through the lens of memory, over a gap of 60 years. Likewise, all the moral ambiguities that made the book more than just a good yarn totally vanished in the film. In the botched execution, for example, the book makes it crystal-clear that Paul (Tom Hanks' character) has the authority to stop the execution and in fact he sees the execution is being botched in time to stop it. He doesn't, however, because years of looking the other way, not sticking his neck out, not rocking the boat have so thoroughly corrupted him that he lets a man he is responsible for get burned alive rather than make himself conspicuous. In the movie, however, he just looks dumb and oblivious. All the good characters in the movie are totally good; all the bad guys are totally bad and the movie suffers as a result.<br/><br/>Similarly, the religious themes in the book were totally excised from the movie except a rather clumsy parable making Coffey a Jesus figure. My theory on that is that Hollywood can actually do a quite good job with stories about well-known religious figures (Moses, Joan of Arc, Peter Marshall, e.g.) but hasn't a clue as to what to do with ""ordinary Joe"" characters to whom religion is an important motivation.<br/><br/>Very good direction, acting and set; worth seeing if you've read the book and can fill in the blanks."

This movie sure did something to me and For Your Information: I never rated a movie with a 10 before, but this movie sure deserves a 10+! This also is the first time that I write my comments on this movie since I think this movie should get every good comment possible!<br/><br/>During the movie I felt everything possible in a movie: I felt pain, I felt true anger, I felt compassion and I laughed out loud. Not all at the same time! *grin* I felt intrigued and I felt horrified. I cannot recall I have ever seen a movie that was able to drag me into the story as much as The Green Mile did. All I can say right now is that this movie deserves many, MANY Oscars.. What you say? It did? Well, thats what I said ;) No, seriously.. Tom Hanks acted extra-ordinary and together with him, so did Michael Clarke Duncan!<br/><br/>I would like to tell everybody who has not seen it already, please go watch it! It surely is worth the 3 hours! In fact, I wish there was more to this movie! :))"
"dwi_satria","Null","1","2","11 April 2001"," The best Stephen King's movie adaptation
","I'm a big fan of Stephen King, and had no idea at all that his installment novel, ""The Green Mile"", would be made into a movie when I chose the book as the subject of my thesis for university graduation.<br/><br/>I like the story a lot. But I'm always being skeptical to every movie who's adapted from a novel. So, I watched ""The Green Mile"" with great fear, and when it finally ended, I was greatly relieved as it turned out to be what I had expected. Although there are some great scenes in the novel that's been taken away in the movie (it'll be longer if they were inserted, I know), I must say this is the best movie adaptation from Stephen King's book.<br/><br/>
Many well-known reviewers in my country think it was too long. I have asked my friends (common people) who watched it and all of them don't think so. It should be that long, for if it had been a shorter movie, I would have hated it. (Tell me, which scenes that must be cut from the movie?)<br/><br/>I might not be subjective about it, since I'm a great fan of Stephen King, but how many stories in the world that tell about the beauty in the death row prison, and how such pure and innocent beauty (symbolized by the mouse and John Coffey) is mixed up by the brutality and unimaginable violence (symbolized by Delacroix's execution and Wild Bill)? Frank Darabont might not the best director, but he succeeds in transforming the essence of the novel and displaying it perfectly into the big screen. I could immediately feel the sadness of John Coffey at the first time he appeared in the screen only by his expression. I could feel the pain of Delacroix's execution (the scene I fear most, in terms of not conducted properly) through his screaming. And most important thing, I could feel the magic.<br/><br/>
The Green Mile is a great satisfaction and must be a perfect example of movie adaptation."

","*--WARNING- CONTAINS SPOILERS--*<br/><br/>
Before I begin let me say that I sat down to watch this film with an open mind, despite the bad things I had heard about it.I think Tom Hanks is a very talented actor and I was a big fan of The Shawshank Redemption, Darabont's previous film.<br/><br/>Where to begin with The Green Mile? For a start this film is way too long, clocking in at just under 3 hours.It is hard for any film to hold one's interest for 180+ minutes, but some like Casino or The Deer Hunter manage to do so; The Green Mile fails miserably. The key problem here is the story: Tom Hanks and the others do the best with their parts but ultimately the characters are all two-dimensional and unrealistic: the film supposedly shows us how grim life on Death Row is for both inmates and staff yet every character in the film seems to belong on the set of Fireman Sam or some other children's show. The only exceptions to this are the characters played by Doug Hutchinson and Sam Rockwell, two token villains (one inmate, one warden) who are so OTT and charicatured that they belong in a pantomime.Everyone else is as-nice-as-pie. Given that the prison is supposed to house the most dangerous criminals in the state this somewhat undermines the whole film.<br/><br/>The intention of making everybody so nice is probably to show that the positive side of human nature can shine in even the most grim circumstances, yet Shawshank managed to this with believeable characters, ones who both positive and negative qualities. The ridiculous characters completly ruin the story: it is obvious that Percy will purposefully sabotage an execution, that John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) is innocent and indeed that Rockwell was the real killer. The story is weak enough as it is yet Coffey is such an OTT Big Baby that his childish pleas at his inevitable execution are almost funny; I was so bored by this stage of the film that I was mentally urging Hanks and co to power up the chair and cook him.<br/><br/>I maybe excessive in my criticism, but if I am it is only because this could have been a good film- the execution scenes are well shot and are suitably horrific, underlining the barbarism of capital punishment. What we finally are left with however is a prime example of Hollywood emotion-manipulation, a film designed to make its audience cry and therby win Oscars. I saw Bonnie & Clyde a few days before I saw this and that was far more emotional and was very thought-provoking, despite its age.<br/><br/>Some people will doubtless cry their eyes raw at this film and proclaim it to be the best film ever; that's their opinion, which is fair enough. Personally I found The Green Mile to be mediocre at best, and 3 hours is far too long for a mediocre film. One more thing: this film features an indestructable mouse named Mr Jangles. The rodent is probably the best thing about the whole film- his final reappearance is nothing short of hilarious."
"olddave","7","1","2","10 December 1999"," this film is too long
","Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, and now The Green Mile.  They all begin with old croaker characters who begin to tell us a three hour story. Unfortunately, they come back at the end of the film as well and are sometimes nominated for Academy Awards.  Too bad the stories can stand on their own without these unnecessary flashback structures.  In this case, the sequences which take place in the present and are the bookends of The Green Mile ruin the film.  They tack on a good 20-25 minutes and the audience gains nothing for their extra time.<br/><br/>This is an average good film.  I had to give it a 7 out of 10 because people are being too easy on it.  Better films about prisons include:  Bad Boys and Dead Man Walking, both with Sean Penn, Shawshank Redemption, and Cool Hand Luke to name a few.  This film joins End of Days (though is obviously much better) as films that mess too much with religious symbolism and are too obvious with it.  John Coffey is a goofy Jesus Christ, one who sucks the tumors out of one woman only to spit them into a troubled man.  The real Jesus Christ would've been more forgiving.<br/><br/>If we spent less time with Jingles the Mouse, less time with the old croaker actors (the woman is really bad), less time with everybody but John, this would be a much better film, and no longer than 130 minutes.  While a good effort, this had better not be this year's best picture.  And please, Tom Hanks has enough oscars.  Let Jim Carrey and Kevin Spacey duke it out."

","I really liked this. Some parts are Very hard to si through, especially the Second Execution scene. Donno if we need Three of these in the one flick, but there ya go, it IS set on Death row, the director has a point to get across, and it is Hollywood after all.<br/><br/>It reminded  me a little of Phenomenon, if you took the Travolta character's abilities and put'em into use by the big black guy from Armageddon, you'd have it. There was a lotta heart in Duncan's performance, I was struck by how strong a presence he has, and how moving the healing scene outside the prison is as well.<br/><br/>Hanks, Morse, and DeMunn are all pros, I always like seeing Morse esp. in whatever he's in. Very reliable. It's interesting to see how much work Stretch Armstrong is post-Babe, here he gives a fine turn as the warden.<br/><br/>I thought that Sam Rockwell as the psycho chewed the scenery a bit much, but enjoyed seeing babyFace there Percy. I was shocked that he is almost 40 in the film, and played one of the psycho killers in 'A Time to Kill'. Quite a stretch.<br/><br/>Bonnie Hunt and the sickly Warden's wife both turn in fine performances, and both are also aged alot more by makeup than they really are, esp Hunt, who is two years older than me.<br/><br/>There are a couple things wrong-it is too long, I think that the middle execution scene was Not really necessary; and I thought that the finale with the old guy(Dabs Greer, who played the preacher on Little House all those years)narrating his life's turn was a little stretched out.<br/><br/>But overall, moving, insightful, unique, well-made, hard to sit through a couple places.<br/><br/>Kudos also to Mike Jeter and the Mouse too. Both were good.<br/><br/>

"Without Remorse","9","1","2","14 December 2000"," An insight
","I never knew what happened with people on death row. How they felt, what they did, how did the guards felt about all this, how they treated them knowing that they had a few days to live. This movie answers a lot of those questions.. a good insight into the world of death row.<br/><br/>Tom hanks has a problem... and the guys on death row know about it but can DO little for him. Help comes from an unexpected corner or rather cell.<br/><br/>It's a different sort of movie..so watch it without hesitation."
"redkiwi","9","1","2","14 December 2000"," Hanks picks another winner
","Probably the best film I've seen of the year; The Green Mile deserves all the plaudits and awards it gets.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is excellent as the prison guard on death row, but Michael Clare Duncan is superb as John Coffey, the miracle working giant.<br/><br/>The barbarism of the death sentence comes through during a blundered execution that was the deliberate work of a sadistic guard.<br/><br/>Thought provoking and moving throughout, the length of this film wasn't a put off whatsoever.  Several funny moments also made it enjoyable as well as moving."
"mynameislove","10","1","2","6 December 2000"," This film IS a miracle
","I feel reluctant to compare The Green Mile with The Shawshank Redemption, because IMO the latter film is more about what it can be like in a prison, with sadistic wardens, etc, whereas in The mile the guards (save for Percy...) seem to have quite a tender heart, they're more humane. I don't think this is a repetition of a movie, to make an even better one.<br/><br/>I think I got the message of the film after about 45 minutes; that there is so much hatred and anger among people, and that revenge is nothing constructive. A very important message which I think the film delivers brilliantly, with John Coffey as a ""triumphant card"". The supernatural effects in the movie might be unbelievable if you focus solely on them, but I think they're ""metaphoring"" and make things a bit more understandable, maybe.<br/><br/>There are flaws of course in this movie as in every other movie made, but I think it is unfair to give it a bad review, as the message is so important, there is so much magic in the film (I was totally spellbound and numb at times, and also nearly cried my eyes out, esp. in the later scenes), and the acting is so professional. The fact that I also took the movie quite personal (I tend to be a prejudice and critical about ppl sometimes - don't we all?), made me love it even more.<br/><br/>If you are not touched by this great movie, you must not have been watching it very carefully - ""reading between the lines"" - or you have a heart of stone (which I hope you don't :)<br/><br/>An absolutely emotional experience: 10/10."

","THE GREEN MILE is a very absorbing and engrossing story. As you watch this film, you get so wrapped up in the story and its characters, that you totally forget the passing of time.

When he meets the newest prison inmate, who's about 7 feet tall, he seriously doubts the guilt of the crime for which he was sent to prison. He discovers he's a very sweet and childlike person, and he even has a gift of taking diseases away from people.  <br/><br/>I can't tell you more than that, because I'm afraid I'd spoil the movie for you.

","""The Green Mile"" will doubtlessly be nominated for Best Picture. Which is unfortunate, as it doesn't deserve to be.<br/><br/>Comparisons to ""The Shawshank Redemption"" are inevitable, but, despite their similar origins, they are entirely separate entities, and deserve to be graded as such. However, ""The Green Mile"" probably would have been better served by being a bit more like ""Shawshank"".<br/><br/>Michael Clarke Duncan (in the role of John Coffey) and Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb are the only fleshed out characters here. Doug Hutchison as a particularly nasty prison guard certainly stands out, but he is a caricature, which is the unfortunate truth of almost the entire supporting cast. Barry Pepper and Jeffrey DeMunn as fellow guards could have played each others' characters, and doubtlessly it would have gone unnoticed.<br/><br/>The performances are not bad, by any means, but the performers themselves are given little to do. It isn't helped by the fact that every significant moment is announced to the audience by slow motion photography, swelling music, and sparks of light coming from the damndest places. Which is what the entire movie boils down to: manufactured emotions. People will certainly come away from this movie teary-eyed, with visions of Oscar dancing in their heads. But if you were to ask one of those people why they were weeping, they probably wouldn't be able to tell you. And not because it's indefinable. The movie simply does such a thorough and subtle job of pushing the right buttons that people don't realize they've been pushed.<br/><br/>This is a good movie, and if you want a good cry, I certainly recommend it.

","When ever I pick a video with Tom Hanks I know I'm going to watch something that will move me in some way.  Aside from his talent, the man obviously has good judgement in the roles he chooses.<br/><br/>Strange as it seems I had no prior knowledge of 'The Green Mile'. Somehow I managed to  miss the promotions and nobody had commented on it. I found myself in the video store desperately trying to find something different and I think I found it!<br/><br/>I must confess I was unaware that this was the work of Steven King and was delighted with a more feeling approach from the man. I have at times found him very hard to read although I have enjoyed many of his movies. I do feel the man deserves enormous credit for what is essentially a damn good yarn!<br/><br/>As the story unfolds we discover a bunch of guys doing their utmost to make the last days of the condemned prisoners in their care as humane as possible. Their biggest problem appears to be the sadistic nature of the latest recruit which is compounded by his connections to people in power.<br/><br/>
What evolves is a very moving picture touching on fantasy and emphasising the loopholes of the 30's judicial system.<br/><br/>Hanks is as good as always and much like a golfer, at the end of the day only competing against his past performances.  Once again David Morse plays an excellent supporting role.  Michael Clarke Duncan shows himself worthy of great things to come and Doug Hutchinson makes a powerful appearance of the man we love to hate.  Credit too must go to Frank Darabont who turned a good story into a great movie.<br/><br/>There are some horrific scenes which I thought my wife would hate, however all is justified in the telling of the story.<br/><br/>The result is I'll be looking for the names above when I'm looking for movies and maybe give Steven King's books another look."

"Shecky J. O'Pootertoot","9","1","2","4 September 2000"," It's the reason I go to the movies
","The Green Mile is one of those movies for people who love movies. It's a combination of a terrific cast, a hot director, great script, likeable characters, and Tom Hanks, whom the term ""likeable"" seems to have been invented for. This movie was custom made for the Oscars, and although it did not take away the awards it would have liked to, two best picture nominations for Darabont's first two directorial efforts ain't bad at all. Maybe it doesn't break any new ground when compared to some of the more outstanding achievements of 99, but that doesn't matter. It's a movie, made for those of us who enjoy going to the movies, packed full of high drama, a decent helping of suspense, and some generally moving sequences. It also finds a way to slip in a message in what has to be one of the most gruesome deaths I've ever seen in a movie, but at the same time it manages to not be preachy. it's not hard to see that this movie is probably against the death penalty, but I think it treats the subject in a fair and even-handed way. I think this movie will have made a Hollywood heavy-hitter out of Frank Darabont, and it couldn't have happened to a more worthy guy. It's also unfair that he has taken criticism for doing two Stephen King novel adaptions in a row, and both having focused around a prison. Besides the obvious similarities, the two films are completely different, and I wouldn't mind if he made a career out of adapting King/prison movies if they were all as good as Shawshank and the Mile.<br/><br/>Let's start with Hanks. Y'know, ten years ago I would never have guessed that Tom would be the huge player that he is now, nor that he would be suited for such roles as diverse as a grizzled army captain in WWII, an unfortunate, gentle AIDS victim, a lovable mentally challenged ping-pong champion or the executioner of death row inmates in a Louisiana penitentiary. Times, they have a-changed, my friends. Doesn't mean I rush to the theatres to see the latest Hanks film, some are better than others, but he deserves a lot of respect for rising to the top of the heap in Hollywood dramatic pictures. I like him. Who doesn't? Other actors of note were David Morse (he never disappoints, but I'd like to see more of him in leading roles. Remember The Crossing Guard, anyone?), and Sam Rockwell, who must be a rising star because he steals every scene he's in in this one. Wild Bill is one sick puppy, but I'll be dammed if he isn't a riot to watch as he torments the guards on the green mile. Other actors I enjoy are Gary Senise, James Cromwell and Barry Pepper. All are good, but they aren't given much to do so they don't leave a lasting impression. Michael Clarke Duncan does a good job as the enormous, simple and gifted man, but I wasn't sure it was Oscar worthy. I often wonder how hard it really is to play a mentally challenged person, since it seems every year at the Oscars there are always a few nominees for playing the part. He just seemed a little too sweet to me, but that may be the fault of the writers, but the award did go to Michael Caine for what was considered by many to be a terrible movie, so what do I know? My only complaint would have to be the length of it all. I really feel that is could have used a few cuts to speed it up a bit, but that's about it. The first time I watched it I was constantly comparing it to The Shawshank Redemption in my mind (a superior film, in my opinion), so I was a little disappointed, but that was unfair of me. Standing alone, this is a great film and it deserves all of the praise it has received. If you love going to the movies, chances are you'll love The Green Mile. 9/10 stars. G'night!"

I've seen films a fraction of that length that have dragged interminably.<br/><br/>The scene of the last execution ( I won't say who's encase you haven't seen it yet ) was one of the most moving I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The story while involved was engrossing and the effects spectacular.

The Green Mile<br/><br/>
Directed by: Frank Darabont, 1999<br/><br/>
Sterile and chummy Stephen King adaptation. Filmmaker Frank Darabont wrote the screenplay and directed, with Tom Hanks planned for the lead role since the beginning. Formulaic and sentimental drama has few highs and many lows (including a three hour running time). David Morse  a terrific and charismatic actor  is seriously wasted.<br/><br/>
Way inferior to The Shawshank Redemption (also King and Darabont) and it undeservedly got caught up in much hype. The superficial tone isn't convincing at any time and the special effects and slick characters are too glossy for the movie to touch in any sense."

","I cannot believe some people rank this movie higher than The Shawshank Redemption. Allow me to briefly compare the two. (Yes, comparison is totally warranted, seeing as there are written by the same author and presented in a similar manner)<br/><br/>The Green Mile has an ""inspiring"" story which it tells in a truly ordinary manner. It plays heavily on such nonsense as ""miracles,"" and the star-power of Tom Hanks. There is no inner meaning to the Mile beyond what is presented on screen. Is there good filmmaking, yes, but it's just so superficial. The water runs no deeper than the events that occur, no matter how fond you are of the idea of fate and wonderful things.<br/><br/>Shawshank, on the other hand has an ""ordinary"" story told in a truly remarkable manner; it is not an egocentric recap of Andy's adventures in prison, but about how he has inspired Red's life in the way he deals with his situation. The movie reflects so deeply in the conflicts of human life; the idea of purpose, worth, and taking control of one's destiny. This is where the Mile so grossly misses the mark. What are we to do with its story?"

It wasn't so much the plot, but the people that evoked such emotion. The guards and the kindness they showed to people who had committed heinous crimes, really made me well up. The acting was superb by everyone. I especially liked the performance of the highly underrated David Morse. When this stoic character cried, I did also.

"sirpauly","6","1","2","31 July 2000"," Not as great as the book, but still worth checking out.
","While the Stephen King novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" translated into one of the greatest films of all time, ""The Green Mile"" (while a marvelous book and a pioneer in the art of story telling), fails to achieve the level of intensity and magnificence of the book. A prison guard stationed on Death Row meets an inmate who is not only innocent, but a ""pure"" child of God; a miracle worker. The movie revolves around the relationship between the guard, Tom Hanks, and the inmate, dramatic-newcomer Michael Clark Duncan. Both of these actors do a fantastic job, while the supporting cast only improves the aura of greatness. So where does the grief lie? The movie moves slugishly, so bad that people forget why they are even WATCHING certain scenes. While intense and moments, the majority of the Green Mile is somewhat boring, and while boring-ness is not alone bad, combined with a bad translation from the book to the movie...it can be deadly."

If you're some kind of philosopher, this film can be seen as a modern version of the story of Jesus Christ's crucifixion. <br/><br/>When you leave the cinema, you may think differently about death penalty, although the film is more than just an anti-death penalty statement. If you don't believe in magic and if you don't like the cast of 'good'(Coffey, Des, ...) and 'bad' people (Percy, ...), then this 3-hour-movie will be hard to swallow.  I, for my part, tend to be in the 2nd group."
"awillcox","7","1","2","20 July 2000"," Great intention, but too sketchy to deliver
","It's amazing what Hollywood can do to a good book.  In an effort to make this a ""new age"" movie, Darabont stripped the book of its essential spirituality.  Whereas the book has several, specific prayers and a visible minister character, this PC version leaves out any specifics, in a seeming quest for the separation of church and mind.  This is not surprising, if you visit the official WB site, which has a link to a new age organization peddling a book ""Experiencing God without belief.""<br/><br/>Many of the performances are exceptional, especially Doug Hutchison (Percy), who brought depth and finesse to a very difficult character.  King's compelling book is airbrushed and soft-focused out of leaving anything but emotional impact behind in a new-age soup of feel-good, feel-bad emotional highs & lows."
"sal_ruggiero","7","1","2","1 July 2000"," An outstanding picture
","When I was going to rent THE GREEN MILE, I was doubting that I would like it because of the idea that the story couldn't be that realistic. A man with special powers in death row didn't sound that exciting and I thought to myself, how could the Oscars nominate a picture with that kind of storyline that lasted three hours long? When I watched it, my whole attitude changed.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont's vision of THE GREEN MILE is amazing in everyway. It is so touching. Children to elders will hang on to the very end to see what happens. We see what it is like to live in the south, in the depression, in a death row prison. Tom Hanks leads an outstanding cast including Academy Award nominee Michael Clarke Duncan as the gentle giant John Coffey, like the drink only not spelt the same.<br/><br/>The makeup in this picture is just as amazing. I am surprised that Oscar overlooked THE GREEN MILE there. The picture is inspirational and marvelous. It's competition for Best Picture though are much better films. THE GREEN MILE I feel is even better than Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption."" A great film!"
"Graham_Millar","6","1","2","2 July 2000"," Soporific epic has moments.
","This widely praised film deigns slowly, as a parent to a child, right up until its first execution, which hits the audience over the head with a scene of a violent, tremorous death and ensuing smoke wisping from the corpse's char-broiled body. It then resumes its gentle preach until the second execution, which displays, in lugubrious detail, flames ripping up the side of a man's head, thoroughly cooking his flesh and gassing witnesses out of the room as he screams and while the guards debate the matter.<br/><br/>Special effects, like countless modern films, do not enhance anything but rather only distract. Patience while enduring the slumberous opening and the presentation of unimaginative characters, plus the exhausted screen writing standard of the old man telling his drawn out story in a flashback, is rewarded by a good scene of men crying and an inspiring last line.<br/><br/>Many details were unnecessary, and at over three hours long, it seems someone released the uncut version by mistake. Short naps do not run the risk of missing vital plot developments. At least 45 minutes should have been whacked.<br/><br/>For an infinitely better Stephen King film, see ""The Shawshank Redemption""."

","Being a Stephen King fan, I have been mostly disappointed in the movies made from his works. (""Stand By Me"" & ""The Shawshank Redemption"" being exceptions).  I was not sure if ""The Green Mile"" would be worth watching, but after seeing so many rave reviews on IMDB, I decided to rent it.  I am sure glad that I did, as this film is truly outstanding!  Every one of the supporting characters did super jobs in representing the feelings and emotions created by the King novel.  At just over three hours in length, it is a bit long for some people's taste, but I found that not to be a problem, as I was being entertained for the entire time.  The movie contains some fairly graphic violence, but it is contained within the framework of the plot, and seemed to me to be a necessary element. The musical score was very well done, the filming was outstanding, the plot was faithful to the source material, the acting was great, and this movie had warmth, humor, style, and a well intentioned moral message.  What's not to like?  I give it a resounding 10 out of 10!"
"tfrizzell","Null","1","2","25 June 2000"," A Good Film, But No ""Shawshank Redemption""
","Whether it is fair to compare this film with ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a question up for debate.  However, since there is no decision on that topic I am going to make the comparison.  ""The Green Mile"" is a long way from ""The Shawshank Redemption"".  This film deals with a massive death row inmate in 1935 Louisiana played by Michael Clarke Duncan (in an Oscar nominated performance) who is charged with the murders of two small girls.  It is clear from the start that this man is not evil or dangerous at all, in fact he is blessed with the power to heal.  The supernatural aspect of this movie turned me off almost immediately.  It seemed that writer-producer-director Frank Darabont was going for something between ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and one of Stephen King's other novels that dealt with supernatural phenomena.  The result is a film that is uneven in many respects, in spite of the fact that it is very well made.  Tom Hanks does nothing to help out the problem as he gives his weakest performance in years.  William Sadler and Gary Sinise have such little screen time that one barely even notices them.  Everyone else just seems to be along for the ride.  Duncan is the revelation.  He keeps a questionable screenplay above water and holds the audience's attention for most of the 3 hours and 7 minutes.  That's another drawback, this film is way too long.  I think that 30 minutes could have been deleted and the end product would have still been the same.  A very considerate 4 out of 5 stars."

"Rhino Rover","9","1","2","11 December 1999"," excellent
","Should this movie get Oscar nominations? Yes. Should Tom Hanks get an Oscar nomination for his performance in this movie? Definitely. In short, this movie was very moving and makes some powerful statements about racial equality and capital punishment.<br/><br/>Based on a novel written by Stephen King, this movie deals with the internal conflicts that a particular prison guard, Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), faces as he meets an inmate that is on deathrow that he believes is innocent. John Coffey (Michael Duncan) is the gentle giant that has been accused of killing two little girls and is scheduled to die in the electric chair. He is brought into deathrow where Hanks' character first meets him but as the movie progresses, Hanks character begins to see the true nature of this man. Coffey comes across as a gentle, caring, yet simple man and to complicate things, he poses the ability to give life which ultimately casts doubt as to the man's ability to harm another living creature. Throughout the rest of the movie you get to see the relationships that develop between this inmate and all the guards as well as with some of the other inmates. This movie does bear some resemblance to ""The Shawshank Redemption"" but only slightly. The issues that are dealt with here are a little heavier in nature.<br/><br/>This is one of the few movies that I have seen all year where the acting in it was extremely strong. There was not a single character that I found portrayed ineffectively or unrealistically. A couple of the more notable performances (aside from Hanks) came from David Morse (character of prison guard, Brutus Howell) and Michael Jeter (deathrow inmate, Eduard Delacroix). Both of these men brought a sense of feeling to their character that the audience truly felt. This was also the first film that I have seen Michael Duncan in and was pleasantly surprised. First of all, this man is HUGE. You sort of have a glimpse of his enormity in the commercials and trailers but you definitely get the full effect of it when you see him stand next to David Morse or James Cromwell. Both of these two men are about 6'6"" but are dwarfed when Duncan walks into the scene with them. Aside from his ""physical"" presence, this man gave a stirring performance in this movie, especially at the end in a lengthy dialogue sequence between Hanks and himself.<br/><br/>The are a couple of things that I do have to point out. This movie is very long (3+ hours) and you definitely feel it. There are no action sequences but there is a lot of dialogue that you have to pay attention to and this attributes to the lengthiness that you feel. In addition, quite a bit of the cinematography was shot in very low light. Whether this was done on purpose to enhance authenticity or just due to poor lighting, I found it occasionally difficult to see what was going on.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was excellent. Be prepared to be cerebrally engaged as this movie definitely makes you think. Also, bring a box of tissues. You will definitely leave the theatre with a tear in your eye...or at the very least, a lump in your throat."

"JimPills","Null","1","2","11 December 1999"," The last millennial allegory
","In his first film since ""The Shawshank Redemption"", Frank Darabont once again takes us inside the King County Pen for ""The Green Mile"", a mysterious and surprisingly grim story about a prison guard who gets to touch the miraculous.  However, that very miracle is what he has been fated to destroy, and the film therefore becomes the story about how a man comes to spend a lifetime atoning for the greatest sin of all. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks, once again in fine form, stars as Paul Edgecomb, the guard of the Green Mile, a Louisiana state prison's death row facilities.  One day, a new prisoner comes onto the block, and immediately stands out.  John Coffey (dig the initials) is big, slow, and good of heart, and stands convicted of the murder of two innocent girls.  Coffey, it turns out, is a man of supernatural sensitivities, in more ways than one.<br/><br/>The film starts out with rock-bottom realism, thanks to the authentic production design of Terence Marsh and the consistently eloquent cinematography of David Tattersall.  However, as the hyperreal elements of the story begin to creep into prominence, the story intensifies, becoming more magical...and sadly, that's where it lost me a little bit.  What made ""Shawshank"" so powerful was that the redemption of the men had nothing to do with God or miracles, but with their own will, hope, and determination. Giving these desperate, damned men a hand from above can make for interesting philosophical considerations, but from a purely plot-driven standpoint, it almost feels like cheating.<br/><br/>Still, there's a lot here to recommend.  Darabont's direction is carefully controlled and skillful, and the film is supported at all times by another unique score from the wonderful Thomas Newman.  However, this is another case of a film being elevated by its actors.  In addition to Hanks, we have a star-making performance from Michael Clarke Duncan as Coffey (who would have guessed that Bear from ""Armageddon"" had this kind of soulfulness in him?), and great work from Doug Hutchison as a sadistic guard, David Morse as the other wise man of the block, and Michael Jeter as a prisoner who falls prey to the most unfortunate execution in cinema history.<br/><br/>The film is involving, and the three hours the story takes to unspool do not drag.  However, the initial feeling one is left with is of grim hopelessness.  Without giving away too much, let me just comment that it does not say a tremendous amount for mankind that the ultimate punishment is to be an observer of the follies of man.  Bearing witness to atrocity, however, can often be the best way to ensure that future tragedies do not occur, and in many ways, that is the message of the film...an important message to carry with us as we plunge into an uncertain new thousand years."
"mreisman","Null","1","2","3 April 2000"," Too Long
","This is clearly a well-made movie, with good intentions, but it's easily an hour too long.  You could actually read most of the book in three hours. And with the ample lighting provided by people checking their Indiglo Watches, you could actually do it in the theatre.  If there were more to uncover about the characters in the story, I might have better tolerated the length.  But I don't know any more about these people than I did in the first 15 seconds in which they were introduced.  They are either Very Good, or Very, Very, Insanely, Ridiculously Bad.  Admittedly, Stephen King has never been the master of character depth, but he has never been this predictable.  You don't need to go farther than John Coffey's initials to tell you what's going to happen to him.   Props to Michael Duncan and Michael Jeter for powerful commitment to their one-dimensional roles."
"proteus-14","Null","1","2","31 March 2000"," Brilliant, Touching, but Somewhat Disappointing
","This movie was a masterpiece of film-making, but being a huge fan of Shawshank Redemption, when I saw that Frank Darabont (director of Shawshank) was directing this, it was on my must see list in a second. True, a powerful performance was given by all characters in the film, some roles more than others, but after sitting through 2 of the 3 hours of the movie, I was growing listless and wanting to leave. The movie just had too many things going on at once, too many small to medium size sub-plots all moving at the same time in different directions. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie as a whole, from the fresh new characters and their struggle to the comic relief of Wild Bill Wharton. Darabont successfully re-creates the dark and brooding atmosphere that was the standard in prisons of that time, although I feel that this movie was a letdown compared to Shawshank.<br/><br/>In wanting to get more from the movie, I took the liberty of buying the six book set of The Green Mile, by Stephen King. Of all the movies I have seen and owned in my 20 years, this one follows the book series almost to the letter. After reading the books, I went and saw the movie again, and got a lot more from it this time. Maybe it was because I went to the restroom before I sat down so I could endure the whole 3 hours in peace..<br/><br/>In closing, The Green Mile will surely go down in history as one of the most powerful and touching movies to ever be produced. I think however, that in movies that are so flawlessly created to re-create reality, in present times or past, adding such a large fantasy element really ruins the whole style of the movie. (a la Forrest Gump) The ability to believe in a 7 foot 450 pound black man with healing powers doesn't really help the reality of the movie much.. the painstaking recreation of the set to make you believe you are really on the mile of the old prison. This is where Shawshank edged this movie. We could all relate to Andy Dufresqne, his struggles, because he was a realistic person, in a very real (but re-created) environment. We could hear and appreciate the playing of the opera over the loudspeaker because Darabont did a super job of putting us there. The scene in the end of Shawshank where Andy is reaching for the sky in the rain is beyond words. Compared to the climax of this film, The Green Mile is ""Green"" with envy."

I left the theater in a daze at the 3 hour running time, and utterly disappointed in the film.  Let me just say that I thought that the film was very well cast, and the direction from Darabont was actually quite good.  What was lacking was a good, intelligent script.  If you break it down, there is not really an original idea in this entire film.  It's like King and Darabont watched as many prison films as they could, and stole all the good ideas.  If you don't believe me, check out Birdman of Alcatraz.  They even stole from their previous collaboration, and far superior film, The Shawshank Redemption.  This script, and story in general, also lacks any true heart or emotion.  The characters are paper thin, and we are told which ones to like and hate.  The filmmaker does not give us a chance to choose; the bad guys are totally bad, and the good guys totally good.  Plus, all the big so-called ""emotional"" scenes are totally contrived and completely phony.  I might be coming down a little hard on this film, but only because I wanted to like it, and I expected better. With all the talent involved, this should have been a great film. Instead, it is quite disappointing.  Sorry guys."

"SimmoMar-2","Null","1","2","14 March 2000"," Not Shawshank, but still fabulous
","I came into this movie with extremely high expectations.  Having seen Shawshank at least 30 times, it IS my absolute favorite movie, I anticipated another masterpiece from Darabont and I was pleased to see such a marvelous piece.  So it was three hours.  There have been other masterpieces of this length, like Braveheart and Gettysburg.  And unlike others, this movie takes its entire length and makes the most out of every scene and every minute. Also taking into consideration that a Stephen King novel is no short piece of work, I'm impressed they were able to consolidate the book into 3 hours anyway.<br/><br/>What makes the movie are these.  First the cast is superlative.  We start with Tom Hanks, who in my opinion earned his Oscar in THIS film not Private Ryan.  His sidekick as it were is David Morse, who we know from his extremely different roles in The Rock and The Long Kiss Goodnight.  Cromwell was excellent, as well as Sinise, and Michael Clarke Duncan takes a huge turn from his normal tough-guy and bouncer routines to play the sympathetic John Coffey.  What I liked best was to see Barry Pepper and Sam Rockwell who've taken a drastic turn from their normal roles to play something entirely different.  Pepper and Hanks were in Ryan together if you remember, but I last remembered him from Enemy of the State.  Rockwell was in Box of Moonlight, and he goes from a happy go lucky slacker in a coonskin hat to a crazy psychopath whose past is darker than we first think.  This mix of top-billers, lesser-knowns and indies makes for an excellent batch of a cast that carries the film perfectly.<br/><br/>Second of all, the music made it for me.  Thomas Newman writes the score, as he did for Shawshank.  The man knows how to capture mood so perfectly.  His quiet and remorseful piano in Shawshank built the sympathy for Dufresne that Darabont and Stephen King intended.  I particularly liked his xylophone like arrangement for the mouse in the movie.  I can't put a finger to which melody I liked best, but my emotions have always been dictated by the music and this score had me bawling.<br/><br/>Thirdly, a solidly constructed atmosphere for the movie.  The depressed time of the period already adds a certain tone, but the dusty bright daylight of the outside world contrasted to the clean and unchanging condition of the Green Mile really demonstrate the isolation.<br/><br/>And last of all the storyline is magnificent.  There are so many small allusions to catch.   I can't even really describe it, but there is so much to catch and ponder afterwards so I won't even bother trying to explain it all.<br/><br/>I'm still partial to Shawshank, but this movie was a close second for me.  I don't recommend the weak of stomach see it.  But if you can bare the gore of Seven and want to see a quality film, I can't think of anything I'd rather recommend."
"Oliver1984","Null","1","2","25 February 2000"," Highly Overrated
","I guess when you hear Frank Darabont is making a Stephen King prison-movie, you can't avoid comparison with the vastly superior Shawshank Redemption, but the fact is that the only thing combining theses two movies are those three things.<br/><br/>Green Mile is a triumph in camera-work, direction and acting. The movies visual look is outstanding, and the actors deliver good performances. This is much courtesy to Darabont, since Shawshank also was well filmed and acted throughout. No complaints there.<br/><br/>But when it comes to plot it seems Darabont is trying to get away with the same thing he did in Shawshank, mixing a lot of sentimental crap in between, to make the movie more appealing to mainstream audiences. Where Shawshank was one of the rare movies to be overly sentimental, profane and grim at the same time (I still don't get how he pulled it off), and still being touching and entertaining, The Green Mile fails to do so. On one hand there are the graphic disgusting executions, and the tasteless barbeque jokes, and then there's a huge endearing innocent guy who's healing everyone. That just doesn't work.<br/><br/>There's probably more graphic violence in Green Mile than in Shawshank, but also more sentimentality, and besides there's a rather silly E.T wannabe subplot that's overshadowed by all of the other stuff going on. The result is a good-looking, entertaining, but empty movie.<br/><br/>Darabont is probably trying to make a statement about the death-penalty, but it isn't working the way it's supposed to. Just by having extremely graphic electrocutions of sympathetic characters, and inmate psychos sneering at it, it doesn't make the viewer think it's wrong. I think i actually heard someone laugh at the ""barbeque-jokes"", and that proves that the movie didn't do what it was supposed to. In the ending scene it's more effective even though the electrocution is shown off-screen, but it is spoiled by excess sentimentality.<br/><br/>The good part is that the movie isn't boring at all. It's very entertaining and the length doesn't seem to be a problem. Conclusion: to say it is an ultimate humanistic prison-epic is wrong, but to say that it's good, stylish entertainment is very close to the truth."

"stiny","10","1","2","13 February 2000"," Take the journey of The Green Mile
","From the start to the end The Green Mile arouses all the emotions in your body thrusting you into E Block (Death Row) at Cold Mountain Penitentiary. This movie will consume you from beginning to end leaving you breathless as you exit the theater. Frank Darabont masterfully directs this prison tale. You may remember Frank Darabont as the first time director of another prison epic, The Shawshank Redemption. The cinematography in this movie is great, with lush colors it turns the nightmarish death row setting into a beautiful structure of death. It is a pleasure to watch this movie. The Green Mile tells the story of death row in a 1930's prison and the incidents that take place there. It focuses mainly on an inmate named John Coffey who seems to have supernatural powers. You may notice that John Coffey's initials (J.C.) are identical to another influential biblical figure. Coffey is played by Michael Clarke Duncan in a breakout role. He can be seen previously in Armageddon but you will definitely remember him for this role. For most of the movie your not sure if Coffey is innocent or guilty but you suspect that he is innocent. As you discover Coffey's story and learn about his character you follow three other inmates two of which you follow to the electric chair affectionately named ""Old Sparky."" These electric chair sequences are some of the most harrowing and suspenseful scenes in a long time. I personally could hear my heart pumping during them. The most powerful part of The Green Mile is the acting. Tom Hanks gives his usual brilliant performance that we have come to expect from him but the supporting cast is the best part of the movie. David Morse (Contact,The Negotiator,The Rock) gives an excellent performance as the biggest of the guards named Brutus. Barry Pepper (Saving Private Ryan,Enemy of the State) also gives a good performance as the smallest of the guards. However Doug Hutchinson gives the best supporting performance as Percy the mean, insensitive guard who often abuses the inmates. The ensemble cast of the guards in The Green Mile have great chemistry together. The actors who play the inmates are also a pleasure to watch. Of course Michael Clarke Duncan (John Coffey) is great but also Graham Greene, Sam Rockwell, and Michael Jeter. Graham Greene plays an Indian who we follow first to the electric chair. He does a great job. Sam Rockwell plays ""Wild Bill"" your usual troublemaker causing havoc throughout the prison. And the great Michael Jeter plays Eduard Delacroix. Jeter just about steals the show as Delacroix the man we grow to love right as he is sent to ""Old Sparky."" He is befriended by Mr. Jingles, the infamous mouse who also almost steals the show. Eduard Delacroix's execution is the hardest to watch due to the fact that it is botched and what happens next is unforgettable. Bonnie Hunt is also good as Tom Hanks' wife just trying to comfort her husband. The cast is what makes this movie really live. The dialogue is some of the best of the year. John Coffey's signature line is when he is introduced to someone. He says ""Coffey, like the drink except spelled differently."" The best line in the movie though is directed at Percy when he is perplexed by what he sees John Coffey do. ""This boy's cheese fell off his cracker"" is the line said towards Percy. The Green Mile is an extraordinary movie in many cases. It is a movie that deserves attention and deserves to be seen. It is a movie that you will be tempted to see over and over again because you want to take the journey many times. It is a movie you will not soon forget and is a movie you wait all year to see. It is a shame that we had to wait all year to see the movie and take the journey that The Green Mile has to offer. ****(cinematic ecstasy)"
"Super Chrille","10","1","2","13 February 2000"," A King lovers thoughts about a wonderful movie
","A fantastic filmatisation of an even more fantastic book! Frank Darabont has done it again! Last time he succeded amazingly with King's The Shawshank Redemption and now he is successful again. It's a long movie but to be honest I didn't look on my watch one time. I was really thrilled throughout the entire movie and I must say that this is a movie for everyone. Tom Hanks acts wonderfully while I'll be supprised if Michael Clarke Duncan isn't nominated for the Academy Awards. He is simply unforgettable, as he had to make himself 30 kilos bigger he certainly fits the role. From beginning to end the story just gets bigger and bigger until you will have to think hard to catch up with all the amazing things that happens. It is like Horror, Drama, Thriller, Drama, Comedy, Drama and Fantasy all together. With the serious discussion about death sentence mixed with supernatural it makes a film worth thinking about. I didn't think that they could make a movie from a King book so close to the book itself. But at that point they really succeded. I'm a big fan of mr King and have read about a dozen books by him, but I think this one takes the prize. In one word astonishing! Go see it!"

There is not a moment in this film where I wasn't either on the brink of crying, laughing or laughing outright.<br/><br/>The story is fairly simple and could easily have been made shorter. But it doesn't feel overlong in any way, much less boring or uninteresting. On the contrary. This is an Oscar film, worth at least four or five for best performances and for best picture and best script.<br/><br/>I envy Stephen King for being able to think these stories up. I envy director Darabont for making them ""happen"", and I sure as hell envy the cast for their fantastic portraits of the prison guards and the prisoners.<br/><br/>Go see this film. I don't understand what you're made of if you don't like it."

It may be a long movie, but you are just so absorbed and overwhelmed by the story that you wouldn't care if it were 5 hours long.

","I read Stephen King's The Green Mile long before it came to the silver screen.  I found the story interesting and entertaining, but not really moving--if that makes sense.  And upon reading it, I could easily see it being made into a film--for television that is.  Many of King's novels have made it to both the silver screen and the television screen, but I am sure this one definitely belonged on tv.  It was simply too long.  I love a long movie--one that can really draw me in and hold my attention that is.  But this film failed to do that for me.  In smaller doses, such as Part 1 on Sunday night and Part 2 on the following Tuesday, I would have enjoyed it much better.  The movie just has too many cheesy moments that are not portrayed very realistically.  But, then again, it is Stephen King and it is a supernatural genre.  There was some good acting in the film, but nothing stellar.  And am I the only one who thinks Tom Hanks just doesn't make a great screen presence?  I can't take him seriously.  All I see is the goofy guy who played in Splash."

","Ironically, although the 3-hour length of this film flew by for me (inclusive of time taken to change discs), I didn't really enjoy it that much. None of the characters were really outstanding, and the plot seemed like a long X-files episode. This film did not tackle the anguish of death row that well - ""Dead Man Walking"" (of which we are reminded early on in the scene when Percy is walking John to his cell) did a much better job of it. Neither is it a showcase the triumph of the human spirit over adversity - ""The Shawshank Redemption"", another Frank Darabont film has that honour. I'd conclude that it's a watchable film, but not deserving of 3 hours of one's time. I'm glad I only spent 10 Ringgit for the video CD."

","If you enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption, don't miss the Green Mile.  Though they are both prison movies, the difference is in the way the men imprisoned make the best of a bad if not impossible situation. The outcomes again are very similar, but different as well.  Tthey each touch the lives of many supporting characters in many different ways.  Miracles can happen anywhere!<br/><br/>The book was a little better then the movie but I think it's mostly because King's character developments are more in depth . It would have made the movie 4 hours or more had it followed the book.  I recommend reading the book before or after the movie. Either way, you'll have stumbled on a gem of a book & some wonderful performances in the movie (Notably Michael Clarke Duncan (Best Supporting Actor) Tom Hanks (Best Actor), David Morse, Michael Jeter, Bonnie Hunt, Sam Rockwell and Doug Hutchinson.)

I can think of only 4 films that would even be mentioned on a Top Ten list, and this certainly isn't one of them.  Sure, it was well done and the acting was top-notch, but the screenplay was horrible.  Cut the ""bookends"" with the old man, get rid of the mouse, have the characters show some kind of intelligence, and cut the movie to about 120-130 minutes, and I'd be on the bandwagon.

"potterj","6","1","2","2 January 2000"," A Moral Cartoon
","Disturbing in its mawkish moral certitudes, The Green Mile makes the guileless and plainspoken suspect and generally undermines its best sentiments.  Despite (or because of?) the loving, ingenuous hand of its director and the everyman appeal of Tom Hanks, the good are deftly made to seem dull-witted in this otherwise well-crafted bit of moral candy. As with any good sermon, you always know exactly what to feel, when to cry, and who to blame.  Perhaps our moral fiber needs a workout like this now and again, but like most exercise, it leaves you hungry for real food."

","This starts off as a fine movie. Excellent acting, especially by Michael Clarke Duncan in a marvelous turn as a condemned saint-like man. But as the Steven King plot begins to thicken so does the layers of pathos laid on by writer-director Frank Darabont. This is not a bad movie but an unterminable one that tries too hard to be important. Three hours can make one weary of the best intentioned designs. Framed like Titanic I predict it will also be wildly popular. It seems we can no longer recognize when we are being fed a sour pill."

"Deckard-16","10","1","2","30 December 1999"," Wow! Darabont and King have done it again.
","This is a very rich movie that takes its sweet time getting set up in its first half and then some gut wrenching and heart felt resolutions in its second half. HOWEVER the first hour and  a half is sweet and very intriguing --it is not a waste of time. Just like The Shawshank Redemption, writer-director Frank Darabont has taken a Stephen King story set primarily in a prison and made it into a faithful and thrilling movie full of heart and soul. The Green Mile is ranks closely behind American Beauty, The Sixth Sense and The Insider as my favorite movie of the year. At some point it gets ridiculous saying which one is better. All I know is that this strange wondrous tale of a very special death row inmate and the effects he has on everybody around him left me and my date stunned. It is brutal, profane, shocking, sweet, heart warming and, at the end, enigmatic. It throws you through a lot of emotions. Although I didn't read the book(s) I've read enough of King to know that his voice rang loudly in Darabont's adaptation. It is a great story. Darabont's treatment in both writing and directing must make the author ecstatic. Tom Hanks shines (once again) as the prison guard assigned to keep peace on Death Row. But when John Coffey becomes his charge he begins to wonder what inner peace is all about. Coffey is played by Michael Duncan in a performance that came as much from out of nowhere as Haley Joel Osment's act in the Sixth Sense. The rest of the cast is also excellent. The amusing meanderings of the first half prove to be essential to the revelations of the second half. It is a real stunner."
"ashleymark83","10","1","2","21 March 2004"," The more times you watch this, the better it gets.
","This is a film which starring Tom Hanks ought to be good. I was wrong. It's mindblowing; absolutely magnificent. There is not one aspect of the entire film that I can pick fault with. Frank Darabont is clearly an exemplar of cinematic masterpiece; the Shawshank Redemption was excellent, this is so good there aren't words to describe it. It has everything; drama- the stories in themselves are quite a dramatic backdrop; comedy-the pathos one could cut with a knife, the characters are constructed beautifully, evil is scorned, goodness is reinforced, and yet it doesn't come across as at all preachy. The tinges of sadness, are just that. Incredibly emotional but never corny, the sentimentality is exuded and the resulting catharsis electrifying. Michael Clarke Duncan is just amazing as John Coffey (""like the drink, only not spelt the same....""). The scenes where the satanic Percy 'forgets' to wet the sponge, and John can feel the executee's pain and he is writhing and jumping in horror so much so that 'Mr Jingles' the mouse leaps from his hands and shoots straight under the door is just awe inspiring. The special effects with the lights exploding, together with Michael Clarke Duncan's acting and the wonderful, apposite score just gels together so incredibly well. The entire ensemble cast were just magnificent. I've always liked Tom Hanks but this has to be his best role. He shows such versatility as an actor. The many different characters he's played in films such as 'Big', 'Philadelphia', 'Forrest Gump'(his second best role), 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'CastAway'- the latter film was not a brilliant one but with any other actor it would have been dire. He has the power to keep the film going by injecting his humour, warmth and damn humanity into the roles, all of them with differences, and lights up the screen. My favourite american film actor of all time, bar none. If you don't own 'The Green Mile' then I suggest that you go and buy it now!!! It's been out a while and it can be bought for less than 8 pounds in most shops now (I guess that's the equivalent of about 13 US Dollars) and for that you get not only a magnificent film of the highest calibre, but a couple of documentaries too.  Well worth it!<br/><br/>PS: If you haven't read the book, it doesn't matter. I would recommend you do though as it's Stephen King's best in my opinion. Other good (they're all pretty good) Stephen King novels include, 'The Shining', 'It', 'Misery', and 'Carrie'."

","as much as i enjoyed the acting in this movie (hanks and duncan are both worthy of oscar nominations) the storyline and character profiles are, awkwardly, biblical.  i think it was the second time john said his name that i thought about steinbeck's ""grapes of wrath"".  in that novel, one of the main characters has the initials JC and comes across as a christ-like, literary character.  very similarly, king has intentionally or unintentionally done the same thing.  john's character is strikingly christ-like, from his magical healing powers on down to his initials.  then of course you have paul.  in THE GREEN MILE paul resembles the paul of the new testament in the sense that he upholds certain family and ethical values and, after john reveal's his powers to him, wants to spread john's ""light"" to those who need it.  with this in mind, the film's story is very much unoriginal and frankly a finely-acted, well-scripted, new testament bible story."

It is annoyingly predictable, with straight personalities and crushing religious overtones. I really disliked how the movie tells you how to feel. I disliked even more how it gets its laughs from torturing a ""bad"" character, while at the same preaching kindness and healing. Why did so many people besides myself like this film?

My only complains it that the film is three hours long, and I feel it could have easily been trimmed by 20 minutes. There are several INTENSE, graphic execution scenes, one which I felt went a little overboard and should have been trimmed. I recommend this film for everyone (except children under 13). It will make you ponder man's goodwill and the future of humanity."
"bjudd","6","1","2","25 December 1999"," Confused about its message
","So was this movie about a Christ-like figure who is killed because his actions are misunderstood?  Or is it about the guilt one man feels because he allowed someone innocent to be executed?  Or was it about what happens in to people who do not speak up with the truth?<br/><br/>This confusion is at the center of ""The Green Mile,"" a film that is wonderful in some place, but baffling in others.  I loved the prison guard characters, especially the empathy and ""humanness"" at each of their cores. They establish relationships with the death row inmates, and seem torn apart when one finally has to die.  I also thought the movie as a whole moved quite quickly through its 3 hour plus length.<br/><br/>However, I am still quite confused after seeing it.  Was the prisoner with the healing powers supposed to symbolize Jesus Christ?  It seems this was the road the filmmakers were taking in the beginning, but then the character did certain things Jesus would never have done.  And what about the ending? This movie seemed to be moving toward a more upbeat, uplifting ending.  As a result, I couldn't help but feeling that the whole ""curse"" ending was tacked on and really did not have anything to do with the rest of the film.  I think this opitimizes the confusion it seems the filmmakers had about what this movie was supposed to say and stand for.<br/><br/>""The Green Mile"" is not a bad film, but it should not gain that many Oscar nods.  I think the Golden Globes made the right call, it was a good film, but not one of the best of the year.  With a great year of films, including ""American Beauty,"" ""The Insider,"" and ""The Man on the Moon,"" ""The Green Mile"" does not cut it as one of the best of the year."
"juniper-2","6","1","2","2 December 1999"," A gratuitous, heavy-handed film
","This film is completely unfocused, and dwells too much and too long on the executions. The guards never seemed disturbed about what they do. They're not happy about it, but one never gets the sense that they're doing a job that makes them wrestle with their conscience. The acting is excellent, though I don't think this will earn Hanks a third Oscar. You come out of the film feeling battered, and the John Coffey role wasn't emphasized enough to make you rejoice at the miracle."

","The final scene will have you in tears, if you aren't in tears already.<br/><br/>  Tom Hanks plays a death-row prison guard, along with Barry Pepper, David Morse, and newcomer Doug Hutchison.  They are all stunned by the entrance of Michael Clark Duncan, a massive prisoner with a child-like mentality.  He begins to do things, unexpected, that change the way these people look on life.<br/><br/>  The performances are equally brilliant, with the supporting characters supporting Hanks with ease.  Hutchison plays a character so mean and reptilian, that if I saw him on the street, I'd have the biggest urge to knock some sense into him.  Barry Pepper plays another young prison guard, who is in awe of the things he sees.  Pepper is subtle in his scenes, projecting hints of sadness.  Duncan, however, steals the show.  Whenever he speaks, or moves, your eyes and ears are on him.  <br/><br/>  Frank Darabont has scripted a moving film, that should get the best picture nomination.<br/><br/>  If there is one flaw, it is in the casting of James Cromwell.  Though he looks perfect for the part, his accent peeks through at times.  But that flaw is minor compared to the rest of the film."
"cupcake-6","10","1","2","21 December 1999"," The best film adaptation to ever grace the screen.
","I read ""The Green Mile"" about a week before the movie opened  here. About 60 pages from the end I began crying for the 3rd time since I had begun reading it.  I did not stop crying until ten minutes after I finished the book.  The book is completely compelling and touching. I consider it to be one of the best fiction books that I have ever read.  I was not sure if the movie would be able to live up to what I had seen in my mind while reading. On the Friday it opened, my fiancee and I went to the first showing.  3 hours and 10 minutes later, the two of us emerged, tear stained and even closer to one another than ever before.  Frank Darabont and cast have created a miracle of their own in this work.  The movie captures every emotion that Stephen King intended to be caught. Emotions that I was never aware that could be caught on film. I have seen reviews and heard opinions about this movie.  Most agree with me, masterpiece, work of art, and so on.  However, there are some people who think that this movie is self-indulgent, over-done, and way too long. Ironically enough, these are the same people who absolutely adored ""Titanic"", which was self-indulgent and far too caught up in it's own grandiose image.  It was also a 3 hour movie, and it did not capture in those 3 hours any of the emotion that the Green Mile captures within the first 30 minutes. Tom Hanks, Michael Duncan (Bear, to those who saw ""Armageddon"")David Morse, and Bonnie Hunt all helped bring to life this absolutely compelling, stunning, and emotionally wrenching picture.  Bravo to Darabont and cast for a beautiful job.  If this, like the equally wonderful ""Shawshank"", is snubbed at Oscar time,  it will be a disgrace to the movie-making business."

These people are all one-dimensional and the story plods towards its inevitable conclusion. The only time the film ""threatens"" to take a real grip on the viewer is in the all-too-brief Gary Sinise scene.

The few changes that were made for the movie I found to be done it great taste and beneficial for the pleasure of the viewer.

","After seeing thousands of movies one can become cynical and jaded about even some of the best there is to offer. Now in the wake of viewing Green Mile, I will forever see movies differently. being a manager of a movie theatre I don't always get a chance to see everything that I run, but have been able to see this 3 times in the first week! each time seeing it I find new emotions pulled from somewhere deep inside. Green Mile is a pleasure to watch from top to bottom and all the nooks and crannies in between, and a credit to everyone who worked on it. sprawling, enchanting, beautiful, harsh, horrific, and most of all human.  I truly mean every word I can possibly say about this movie. In the past I could never give a straight answer on any one movie that I thought was the best or brightest example of acting, cinematography, story, directing , music, etc.... but in the future if the question arises, I'll go out and buy that person this movie. I would love to give this film to everyone I meet, so that maybe they can be be filled with all of the emotions it evoked in me. I guess what I should really be saying is ""Thank you Stephen King, Frank Darabont, Tom Hanks, and every single person that helped bring this wonderful movie to the public"""
"benreed","10","1","2","16 December 1999"," As good as it gets
","Can you say Philadelphia, Forest Gump, Saving Private Ryan? Yes, Tom Hanks is en route to another Academy Award nomination. He is quickly becoming on of the best actors of ""all time"" not just our era. As in The Green Mile, he seems to be at his best in quiet, understated roles. He breathed life into this story while Michael Clark Duncan (they're going to need to cast another Oscar to award to this giant of a supporting actor) simply stole your breath away. You'll be hard pressed to find better ensemble acting. There wasn't a poor acting job in the movie, including the brief roles by Gary Senise (defense attorney), William Sadler (victims' dad) and Harry Dean Stanton (trusty). As for the guards (Morse, Pepper, DeMunn, Hutchison) and prisoners (Geter, Greene, Rockwell) too bad they can't all be nominated. Stephen King knows how to bring the viewer into movie, note the bladder infection subplot, it was a gem. I judge a movie on how I felt when I walk out after the credits, and whether I want to see it again and again. I'll be back. A thousand words aren't enough to praise this movie, but three little words can criticize it -- not long enough!"
"Chris-332","10","1","2","15 December 1999"," Absolutely amazing, powerful, and chilling!
","When I saw the previews for this movie, I thought it looked good, yet not at all as amazing as the modern day masterpiece The Shashank Redemption. It definitely didn't look as powerful. Man, I was completely wrong! This movie is not only the greatest film of 1999, but in my top ten favorite movies! It is the only movie where every single actor in it was outstanding! Tom Hanks once again does an exceptional role in this movie, but I was also very glad that he was not the only one in the movie that had character. Everyone had an outstanding character in this masterpiece. The story was breathtaking, and the fabulous directing by Frank Darabont added to the great screenplay. Some scenes in the movie were EXTREMELY powerful and also VERY disturbing. One scene in the movie would always stand out in my mind as nerve-wrenching. I can predict the oscars now: Tom Hanks winning best actor, Michael Duncan winning best supporting actor, Frank Darabont winning best director, Frank Darabont winning best screenplay, and The Green Mile winning best picture. I certainly hope that's the way they'll go, since they all deserve to win. I am also very mad at people complaining about the length of the film. Okay, maybe some scenes could have been taken out, but still, every scene in the movie was great! The only flaw I can find in the movie is the slapped together and far fetched ending. The movie should have ended after the final death. It shouldn't have gone back to the old Paul Edgecomb, who explains a cheesy ending. But still, the ending doesn't ruin the movie whatsoever. It still is one of my all-time favorite movies, and it will stay on my list for years to come."

There are scenes that are exclusive to the book that increase your understanding of the characters and situations. That is typical, but the amazing thing about this movie is that when it veers away from the novel, it actually enhances the book as well! This film deserves the numerous Academy Award nominations that it surely will get. I never thought that after seeing Forest Gump and Philadelphia that The Green Mile would be Tom Hanks best performance, but it really was. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!"

","Rarely are films made with this level of profundity.  Words fail the best critic.  Description fails the biggest fan.  I can't truly express here what this film will show each viewer.  But I suggest seeing it on a Friday or Saturday - this is an experience that makes it tough to go to work the next day.<br/><br/>Each and every actor delivers a performance that could be judged as the best they've ever done.  Michael Duncan is the keystone which anchors the performances by Tom Hanks, David Morse, Barry Pepper, Doug Hutchison, and Jeffrey DeMunn.  For Michael Duncan I would like to see future roles allowing this depth of character.  I believe he's earned them with this film.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont and David Valdes deserve a big deal of credit for bringing back the emotionally stirring music of Thomas Newman and the Production Design of Terence Marsh from Shawshank Redemption.  Their talents, as always, greatly contribute to the ambiance and moods of the film.<br/><br/>Stephen King must be exceptionally proud of this effort based on his work, whether it follows his vision or not.  For the essence of his story is complete and forceful.<br/><br/>This picture is a dark and powerful look at our humanity and beliefs.  It pulls at all the little sympathies we wear on our sleeves until we begin to feel with genuine empathy and can no longer overlook the blessings that we all take for granted."

","If you're after a film that will grip your heart, mind and soul...then this would most definitely be it. Stephen King's genius is reflected in this thrilling screenplay, based on his book of the same title.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks gives an impeccable performance as Paul Edgecomb, a prison warden, working on The Green Mile (death row). This particular year in time he is faced with meeting John Coffey - magnificently played by Michael Clark Duncan. Coffey is on death row for the murder of two young sisters, but his persona is far from that of a cold blooded killer, he simply seems to be a gentle giant.<br/><br/>Edgecomb gradually begins to warm to Coffey and begins research as to where he came from and considers the fact that maybe he didn't commit this terrible crime at all, especially when he begins to see the miracles which emanate from Coffey's vicinity.<br/><br/>Warden Hal Morris - played by James Cromwell - has a sick wife who is suffering from a brain tumour...helplessly he turns to Edgecomb for guidance. Would it be ethical for Edgecomb to lay this sick woman on the hands of a miracle worker...even though he is on death row?!?!<br/><br/>This King chiller is definitely not for the faint hearted, it is both thrilling and saddening. The performances from Sam Rockwell, as Wild Bill Wharten, a serial murderer and lunatic gives the film an added dash of genius. <br/><br/>Doug Hutchinson as Percy Wetmore, a mean-hearted warden provides public enemy number 1 for the viewers. His relationship with Eduard Delacroix, a pocket sized French prisoner is chilling and the viewers find themselves on the side of the miniature criminal."

Naturally, we find out (that helpful ESP, such a lazy plot device) that he is innocent. The true killer is also on Death Row and meets his deserved end. Oh, and the gentle giant cures the warden's wife of a brain tumor but is executed anyway, which is convenient because the pain of existence is too much for him. Camus, eat your heart out. On top of this torpid sentimentality are layers of ugliness and violence (no fewer than three executions in the electric chair, all depicted in fascinated detail).<br/><br/>Other Stephen King novels have led to astonishing movies.

","A lot of people have told me that ""The Green Mile"" is a fantastic film, and that I should see it. So I did. Usually, I like all movie's where Tom Hanks is a part of the cast, since he's such a brilliant actor, and no matter how bad a script or plot is, he's making the film good just by being on the screen.<br/><br/>I'm not going to tell you about how the film ends, and what made me give it a 3 out of 10, but for those of you who have seen it, I can tell that it was the ending of the film that made me turn it off, before it was even finished. To be honest, I was very disappointed. Still, there's always something good to say about o movie, no matter how bad it is, and in The Green Mile Tom Hanks does a very good job, and the other guards in the prison are pretty good too. Also, Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey and Thomas Newman's music saves the honor of the film, because in my opinion, this film is really bad."

","I usually post reviews of films that I happen to be completely mesmerised by or those which I think could have been worthy of 10 out 10 stars if not for this or that flaw (and for the latter ones the sole purpose of the review itself is to point out the flaws), but this one has compelled me to write out a review just for how bad it is! 'Django Unchained' (2012) was a film that almost made me compose a review for the same reason but that at least had the charm of Dr. Schultz's role and the unique concept of bounty-hunting.<br/><br/>This film however is so bad that I didn't even want to give it one single star but I had to in order to register my protest on the IMDb. Still, if I have had to justify that one star I would it split into halves for the performance by Tom Hanks and for that brilliant joke by by one of the guards of carrying a mouse in his wallet.<br/><br/>It might have made sense as a novel, so no disrespect to that, but as a film it did not. What really was the purpose of the film? To show an innocent being punished? A miracle man? Ill-treatment of blacks? Or worse, the tricks a mouse can perform, or the suffering caused by a bladder infection? Any or all of it doesn't mean that you should end up making such an amazingly boring film. John Coffey 's tears and show of innocence made me feel like punching the screen. He was annoying!<br/><br/>The worst being, they make a three-hour long film, bore you to death, and yet still leave so many questions unanswered: how exactly was John trapped into being accused of raping and murdering those girls? It hasn't been shown, not even when he makes Paul 'feel' his pain by holding his hand - the only thing shown in that scene is how Wild Bill rapes and kills them. So it is left as a John's claim. And, for exactly what was Bill in for? What was his offence?<br/><br/>Another strange scene being, Melinda welcomes John in her room by hurling abuses and asking him not to even come close to her, and yet after she is cured she suddenly relates a dream to John in which she saw both of them!<br/><br/>The first half hour gathers your interest and then you wait on and on for that thing to arrive which makes it earn 8.5 stars over here, but it never does!

","I'm sorry, but I have to say that this is one of the most dissapointing Stephen King movies next to the original Shining.  I believe myself to be one of Stephen King's best fans, and Mr. Darabont did not do as well a job on The Green Mile as he did on The Shawshank Redemption.  He cut out the most important scene of the book - the last scene.  The bus scene is one of the most heart-wrenching, just plain sad scenes I have ever read in a book, and if you don't cry after reading it, you have no heart.  It gets the point of the entire story across to you and makes you feel as if there is no hope in the world.  That's not the best feeling to have, but it was the path the book was taking all along.  With the movie, I felt like I sat through it for 3 hours and went home with a Hollywood happy/sad ending.  They didn't even kill Mr. Jingles!!!  Don't watch this movie - read the book instead.

It also was written and directed by Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, The Walking Dead, The Mist) and was adapted from the Steven King (The Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, Stand by Me) novel of the same name.<br/><br/>The Green Mile is about Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), a guard for the people on death row and the one of the newer members of the men on death row: John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) who seems to have mysterious gift.<br/><br/>This film would not work if the acting was sub-par, it needed to be great to pass. And thank God it did because the acting in this film is truly incredible. Tom Hanks (of course) is great. But he seems to be outshined by a man who has only been in bit parts in movies and TV and a small part in Armageddon which came out the previous year. This man is Michael Clarke Duncan and he gives a great performance of a man who has a very special gift. He plays a enormous man who is afraid of the dark and has been sentenced with the murder of two little girls, but we learn he cares deeply for people and for life itself.<br/><br/>Another part of this film's success is the writing of Frank Darabont. According to Steven King, this is the single closest adaptation to his writing he has seen on screen. But Darabont seems to capture King's story and ideas and puts them perfectly onto paper fully fleshing out the characters.<br/><br/>My only two problems with the film are that the effects are a little dated and the film might be a bit too long, but it still is a very touching, emotional story that will certainly touch you too."

That is what good movies are about.<br/><br/>The movie is perfect adaptation of a Stephen King novel. It could not have been done better. There are some graphic scenes but they are part of the storyline and honestly I have seen worse scenes in other movies. <br/><br/>From actors like Tom Hanks we have come to expect good performances. The surprise package is Michael Clarke Duncan is at his finest. Any doubt on his acting abilities, due to his persona and body, are swept away as he keeps surprising you scene after scene. David Morse does an excellent job as well.<br/><br/>It is on top of my ""must see"" list."
"Cs_The_Moment","9","1","3","4 July 2014"," Beautifully Acted and Touching
","The Green Mile looks at life on Death Row, told from the perspective of guard Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) who recounts, as an old man, his encounter with mysterious prisoner John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a convicted child murder who has more to his story than meets the eye, including a very curious ability.<br/><br/>This film is such a classic and it's beautifully acted. Tom Hanks is an incredible actor and he delivers yet another exceptional performance as the sensitive guard willing to treat his prisoners like people, unlike his colleagues such as the harsh and unforgiving Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison). Michael Clarke Duncan delivers a really touching performance that culminates into an emotional ending that may bring a few tears. Even the other prisoners, played by Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell, offer emotive performances with their own descent into madness knowing that they are waiting to die. The majority of the film is set in either the prison block or the electric chair room, which helps to reinforce the intense feeling of entrapment.<br/><br/>The story itself is a little unusual as there is a touch of the supernatural throughout, however it's surprisingly easy to accept this into the normality of the film. As you can expect from a film about Death Row it is a little upsetting to watch at times, but it's mostly a carefully woven story that gently unravels the history of the prisoners and why they are all there, focusing much more on the emotional aspects of such a setting for both the prisoners and the guards, rather than the physicality of it. I only have one real criticism: it was too long. At just over three hours long I felt like it was losing its emotional momentum and could have managed without some scenes and been just as, if not more, powerful a film. Nevertheless don't be put off by the length, unlike some lengthy films there are no points where you get bored watching it drag on, and even if you feel yourself getting lost towards middle of it, the final third brings you right back into it.<br/><br/>The Green Mile is beautifully acted and a really touching classic film. Despite being a little unnecessarily long it offers a real heartfelt journey and an unusual story that will really evoke some emotion â€“ well worth the three hours of the film!"

A man (perhaps) that can remove illness and injury from people and animals is arrested for murder. The dynamics of the story are further amalgamated by the fact that this man is Black during the Jim Crow era and he is accused of killing a little white girl.<br/><br/>The acting was superb. Tom Hanks around this time was just hitting homerun after homerun. Philadelphia in '93, Forest Gump in '94, Apollo 13 and Toy Story in '95, Saving Private Ryan and You've Got Mail in '98, then Toy Story 2 and The Green Mile in '99. All of his performances were stellar. But the X-factor, the dark horse in The Green Mile was, the now departed, Michael Clark Duncan. An ex-bodyguard turned actor, he did a wonderful job as John Coffey.<br/><br/>This movie evoked a myriad of emotions. Anger, joy, hope, and sadness. The various characters in this film all offered something. No character was wasted. They all made you take interest in one way or another.

And I guess that's why I found it entertaining, but dissatisfying all at once. It's not a film I'll ever wantonly see again.<br/><br/>Technical points; it's a first class production. There are no faults here in execution. This is A-quality commercial film making at its finest. The one fault that prevents me from liking the film is the writing. The whole premise and setup upon which this film is based is left blank. And, if this is not addressed nor otherwise explained, then how on earth can the rest of the film hold together? Simply put, the writer asks you to believe in the supernatural based on the opening scenes and the fate of the main characters. But, even if we're asked to believe in things that cannot be proved, the whole setup, a real situation, is never addressed to begin with. And, if this is so, then how can we invest ourselves in the rest of the story? Again, the fault of the author.<br/><br/>All in all an interesting film, but not one that really held my interest in any regard (I was forced to watch the thing three times while on vacation). If you're of the religious mindset, then you might find this film entertaining. Even if you're not it is worth seeing once for the film itself. <br/><br/>Give it a try."

","Paul Edgecomb is the 'Boss' of a prison for men sentenced to the Electric Chair during the Depression, in 1935. In comes John Coffey ('like the drink, only not spelt the same') - a massive, black man. But as Paul gets to know John Coffey, he discovers that there's far more to this amazing man than just his size and race. John Coffey is about to change the lives of these prison-guards forever, in a way few would except...<br/><br/>This excellent story is brought to life by some terrific acting from all the cast members. I'm staggered that Michael Clarke Duncan didn't win the Oscar, since his performance is so captivating. John Coffey is one of the most lovable and original characters I've ever seen. Tom Hanks is obviously brilliant too and I'm surprised they didn't think about nominating him for an Oscar. The direction of 'The Green Mile' is clearly similar to 'Shawshank Redemption', as the Director uses some of his usual trademarks. The music is perfectly suited, especially to a movie which would not be easy to interpret musically. There is one potential down-side, in that it's a long film - very nearly 3 hours. I watched it in bits over 3 days. Due to the length, it's a fairly slow moving film.<br/><br/>Previously I gave this 8 out of 10, because I hadn't seen it since I was 15. Empire and Total Film gave it 4 stars. But I've just finished watching it (I'm now 23) and I've changed my mind. It has to be five stars - 9/10 or 10/10, it just has to be. It's too good a film - it's too flawless and engaging. It's too unique. It's a very mesmerising film and will stand the test of time, I think. If you haven't watched it, then see it, as soon as possible!"

Of course, emotions after movie are way different. Two years ago, I was laughing aloud after movie saying ""What a waste of time"" now I'm saying ""What a masterpiece!"". <br/><br/>""Why did I have to kill God's miracle ?

I won't spoil the end, however, but I must say that this is the movie, along with few others I won't name, that has the greatest character development ever.

I usually have the annoying habit of wanting to know how long it would take until a film ends, but that was a question that never popped into my head during the course of this film. I've seen the eighteen reviews before me and I've read many of them giving a synopsis of the film. I will steer clear from that and simply say that I absolutely loved all the actors...Michael Clarke Duncan shone as John Coffey (good God that man's enormous), David Morse(Brutus), Dough Hutchison as the vile Percy Wetmore and last but certainly not least, Sam Rockwell as Wild Bill Wharton. He, as all the rest of the cast, was perfect for the role. People who complain about the length of the film don't really understand what The Green Mile is all about, I think... and what it is to me, is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I will certainly see it many more times in the future. Frank Darabont, and everyone else who made The Green Mile exist- especially the main man behind it- Stephen King- I can't thank you enough. This is sheer brilliance."
"blandiefam","6","1","3","7 January 2011"," The Formula that works
","The movie was good. I enjoyed it on one level and was slightly disappointed in the turns it took. It touched themes of racism and even played upon our own feelings about color and mental illness. The movie tried it's best to walk the green mile of movie telling by making the characters either fully terrible or fully good. My only problem with this movie is the fact that a mentally challenged man of color could be allowed to be wrongly electrocuted for a crime against little white girls. All they had to do was let the warden and anyone else (even the parents) touch John and see the crime as well. To allow an innocent man to die and call it a tear jerker is beyond me. The scene where John walks in to the warden's wife's room was totally innuendo with overtones which were unnecessary. The editor pulled down her dressed after the shock factor. Why couldn't the big healer get exonerated and a twist be put on the old formula where John studies Holistic medicine and become ""Somebody""? I wonder when we will transcend the usual stereotypes and not let the societal monster live. King seems to paint his characters with wide brushes but the sacrificing of the same types of people become formulaic. Obviously in the thirties this was most likely impossible in Louisiana but it was also impossible to put a black prisoner with whites. I guess we believe what we are allowed to believe."

","The Green Mile is a brilliant movie with an excellent cast and a well-written plot.<br/><br/>The film has a large cast consisting of many big-name actors, most notably Tom Hanks, who delivers an excellent performance.<br/><br/>The cast actually includes two actors who also appeared in other films with Tom Hanks: Barry Pepper, who was also in Saving Private Ryan, and Gary Sinise, who was in Forrest Gump and Apollo 13. However, Gary Sinise has a much smaller role in this film than he did in Forrest Gump or Apollo 13, you don't see much more than a few minutes of him.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast also includes some notable actors, including Graham Greene, who you might remember as Edgar the Explosives Expert on the Red Green Show, stars as one of the prisoners. Sam Rockwell, who recently starred in Moon, plays an insane inmate who several times has to get put in the restraining room. He doesn't have a major role, but Harry Dean Stanton, who you might remember from Alien, stars as another prisoner who is used when the guards have to practice their electric chair sessions. <br/><br/>The main cast consists of Tom Hanks, who you probably know from a number of great movies, Barry Pepper, who you may remember from Saving Private Ryan, David Morse, who had a supporting role in Contact, and Jeffrey DeMunn, all of whom provide excellent performances. Micheal Clarke Duncan does a wonderful performance as John Coffey (like the drink, only not spelled that way), a man accused of killing two children, and is in fact truly a kind man with an unusual gift of healing.<br/><br/>The film also has a well written story and good cinematography. One thing I really like about this film's plot is it is mostly from the point of view of the guards, something we don't normally see. <br/><br/>Overall, I'd definitely recommend watching this film, it contains what is probably one of the best portrayals by Tom Hanks, as well as a great cast and a great story."

The movie did all justice to Stephen Kings legendary novel. It did made some minor changes but that was necessary to present the movie. The Movie represents more than just cops, prisoners and a guy with powers. The Movie Shows the depth of what our world slowly is becoming, and how people face injustice. Each and Every scene from the novel is perfectly presented in the movie. As for the performance the whole cast did a great job. but Michael Clarke Duncan stole the show. he expressed his emotion just as the character was supposed to be. Tom hanks executed his performance with the uncanny ability that he posses. David Morse, Bonnie hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene, Doug Hutchinson, Sam Rockwell, Jeffrey DeMunn all performed with all heart and soul. The movie is very powerful overall.

","Stephen King's pulpy serial novel was a fun read; writer/director Frank Darabont turned it into a bloated, self-important and self-righteous movie.<br/><br/>He did the same thing, though to a lesser extent, to ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" another adaptation of a King story. Why in the world this man keeps turning to Stephen King for tales of philosophical import I don't know, because the material just isn't there. On paper, ""The Green Mile"" was an effective little story about a man with mystical powers waiting out his life on Death Row. The usual King touches -- including dips into the macabre and supernatural -- are there, but the most interesting parts of the book are the details about Depression-era prison life. Darabont amps up the religious overtones and smothers the story in hokey sentimentality.<br/><br/>My favorite Darabont film to date is ""The Mist,"" a nasty little bit of work that could fit inside ""The Green Mile"" with about an hour to spare.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

","This moving, strong drama is well paced by Frank Darabont, who knows how to do this stuff (see ""The Shawshank Redemption""). His direction along with the familiar score from composer Thomas Newman gives one the strong feeling of ""deja-vu"" at times. The original story was from the pen of Stephen King once again.<br/><br/>Acting in this film may well be its strongest point. Tom Hanks masters yet another role as the practical warden of Cold Mountain Penitentiary. Excellent support come from Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene and many others. David Morse is especially memorable as Hanks' workmate Brutal. The darling of Hollywood now though is Michael Clarke Duncan, after his strong, emotional portrayal of the giant John Coffey who seems so out of place on death row.<br/><br/>Yes the film could be called formulaic, following as it does a reasonably obvious path; and I really didn't like the behavior of certain characters that I thought were above certain responses.

","Stephen King's The Green Mile (1999) is a story about death row in a prison in 1935 and the lives of the guards who work there. John Coffey is a black man who is accused of the rape and murder of a child, but he is a miracle worker because he holds the power of faith healing. The cast includes Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, Bonnie Hunt as Jan Edgecomb, David Morse as Brutus Howell, and Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey.<br/><br/>The theme of this film is about the death penalty surrounded by compassion and innocence of a man who is guilty by association. John Coffey has a gift of healing others through his touch, some my say impossible, but an act of God. Coffey is on death row awaiting electrocution for a crime that he did not commit. This is revealed to Paul Edgecomb, a prison guard, through Coffey's mind while Coffey is touching him in an attempt to heal him. When Coffey uses his power to heal someone it leaves him exhausted, he goes through the pain that the ill is feeling. Throughout the film, he heals a mouse that one of the prison inmates has deemed his pet, the warden's wife, and Paul Edgecomb himself. Once the guards understand Coffey's innocence they do not want to see him be put to death, however, Coffey does. He does not want to bear the pain and thoughts that his special power brings him. He can't take the hurt anymore. He has used all of his compassion and power to save others but wants to end his life so that he does not have to live with the pain anymore.<br/><br/>The use of lighting and angles in this film is important to set the mood of the prison. It is a dark setting to set a dreary and sad atmosphere in most of the scenes. The angles of the camera are low and shoot up at John Coffey making his character look very large. He is a giant compared to the prison guards. This angle makes him look very tall therefore making the guards look much shorter than he.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant film that puts the viewer on an emotional roller coaster ride of joy, tears and laughter. It allows you to travel back to that time era and experience the sadness in a place such as the green mile, an inmate's last walk before execution, but at the same time a feeling of joy and miracle."

","""The Green Mile"" expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama. It was adapted from Sephen King's novel by director/writer Frank Darabont and released in 1999. If you're not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I'm not) DON'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful-and-spiritually-profound film; ""The Green Mile"" is by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes. THE STORY: Tom Hanks plays the head Death Row guard at a Tennessee prison during the Depression. A new inmate is introduced, a hulking black man named John Coffey (exquisitely played by Michael Clarke Duncan), who is condemned to death for the rape and murder of two little girls. Hanks and his guard friends slowly become intrigued by the seemingly pure-hearted giant and begin to realize that he is eminently gifted in a decidedly supernatural way; they conclude that there's no way he could be guilty of the crime. If that's the case, who is guilty? And will the guilty party get away with it. ""The Green Mile"" is a 3-hour film, way over my limited attention span, and yet it is somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings. The film is character/dialogue driven, unique and wholly unpredictable. Please don't mistake this for a run-of-the-mill prison flick. The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue. This is an incredibly powerful supernatural mystery/drama. (SPOILER ALERT! Don't read this next paragraph unless you want to consider possibilities of the nature of John Coffey) John Coffey's last name is, evidently, derived from an ancient Sumerian word, kophi, which means ""winged creature."" Hence, John could be viewed as a angel or messenger from the Almighty. In truth, John is an obvious type of Jesus Christ verified in six ways: (1.) His initials are J.C. (2.) He's completely pure/good-hearted and can easlily recognize true evil. (3.) He miraculously heals people. (4.) He pronounces and executes divine judgment. (5.) He is sacrificed even though completely innocent. And (6.) He offers eternal life (in a sense), as evidenced by the extended life-span of the Hanks character and the mouse ""Mr. Jingles."" (End SPOILER ALERT) BOTTOM LINE: Make no mistake, ""The Green Mile"" is one of the greatest films ever made. It ranks up there with my 5 or 10 best. Don't miss out on this cinematic masterpiece. Now please excuse me while I wipe the tears from my face."

John Coffey is basically an innocent man who was at the wrong place at the wrong time. he was in fact trying to save them by healing them because he has supernatural powers. the film is very heart felt and upsetting. it'll hit you in ways you've never felt.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont is a fantastic director and if he keeps this up he'll probably be crowned as the best director of our time........ 10/10........j.d Seaton"
"eadaoin7","10","1","3","17 January 2009"," When Story Was King
","The most frequent word I have read in all the comments about this movie confirm for me both why I adore this film and why others do as well, because that one word is something sorely lacking in most movies of today - The Story. Truly, how many movies in the last 10 years can you honestly say that the story, the tale, is what took you away from the theater? That the tale from someone's imagination both shed light on your own problems in life and transcended you above them? Also, how many original stories are for adults these days and not from Pixar? I don't say that as a knock against Pixar at all, mind you - they are terrific films. But, they are purely CGI, which is what most 'adult films' are, too. How often have you come out of a theater and said, ""Whoa, did you dig those effects?"" All too often, I think. But it's rare that one can see a film these days and say, ""Wow, what a story!"" Indeed, The Green mile, is one of those.<br/><br/>It is, and yet it isn't, a surprise, also, that the most prolific storyteller of our time has been the ubiquitous Stephen King. Yes, he has scared the daylights out of us. But, he has also made us laugh, made us cry, made us doubt (Misery), made us wonder (The Stand), made us reminisce (The Body/Stand By Me), made us hope (Shawshank Redemption), and above all made us imagine. At this point, I don't think it's accurate to call him a horror writer, because he has proved himself beyond that. He weaves his tales so effortlessly that we go along for every ride he takes us on. As one of the stars in The Green Mile has said, he's just the best storyteller around the campfire - at least in modern times. He often leaves the reader wondering, ""How does he come up with this stuff?"" But above all, it is in the way he tells it. His people are real people dealing with cleverly-disguised-as-unreal situations, and that's why we are drawn to his tales because we can see ourselves and ask ourselves what we would do when faced with the demons we face in life - real or imagined.<br/><br/>This brings us to the story of The Green Mile. On the surface, a fanciful and heart-wrenching tale. But in its telling, it becomes a several tales woven into one tapestry that we all can identify with. Haven't we all had a co-worker who makes our skin crawl and our blood boil but that is so connected we can do nothing about? Haven't we all felt at times so isolated and alone in this big world that we pour our love and care into the first creature that will come along into our ""cell""? Haven't we all felt so uninformed and jumbled that we have a hard time accepting pure and innocent love given without recompense? Haven't we all felt so helpless and broken when we know what the right thing is to do, but we are powerless to stop the wrong from happening? Haven't we all felt hesitant at first to accept the miracle of human kindness? And when that kindness is gone, then why are we still here?Haven't we all felt at times that maybe our travels have gone on just a little too long, to the point when we wonder briefly just why we're still here? I cannot mention one actor in particular without mentioning them all, so I will refer you to this movie's cast list so that you can appreciate just what a true ensemble this is - no one 'star' shines in this film. Everyone shines their own light. The music by Thomas Newman is nothing short of perfection, and deserved a special mention for its completeness in emotion and symbolism, as well as lifting the listener to even higher highs above the story itself (as an aside, and with all due respect, I feel that this score deserved the Oscar for 1999).<br/><br/>This could be coupled with 'Shawshank' as a prime example of cinematic-yet-human storytelling at its finest. And, they are both directed by the same director, Frank Darabont, who seems to understand what grand and caring film-making used to be, and deserves to be again. He sees the beauty in the simple, the humanity in the unbelievable, and he is able to pull off the sadly rare feat of crediting his audience, without resorting to trends or porn or language or lots of blood & booms. He gets it. Plain & simple, he gets it.<br/><br/>Yes, we are all fans of great special effects. We're wowed by big explosions and digitally-enhanced boobs and butts. And, OK, we laugh at naked wrestling men, or stoned losers, or drunk geeks, or anything easily accessible to the masses. Sure, films can appeal to the common denominator - this is evidenced by the string of movies that have their two weeks in the sun, every single two weeks, until another one comes out. But, do we still remember ""Superbad"" with the same awe and emotion as we do ""The Green Mile"", or ""Shawshank""? The same way we remember ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane""? It's easy to give an audience a momentary guffaw or gross-out moment. But, it's rare these days that a film will stir within our hearts and psyches even years after we've seen them. It's rare that a story so original and unexpected can both bring us back to our fundamental selves while sweeping us away. And, just like within The Green Mile itself, it is rare that someone or something comes along who knocks us off our carefully constructed foundation.<br/><br/>But, thank the heavens when they do..."

In fact, the mouse in this movie is the only creature without sin that comforts a sinner. That's the true heart-gripper. I adore David Morse, and he and Tom did an excellent job. My thanks to Bruce Willis for insisting that Michael Clarke Duncan would be perfect for this role, and he was! Heck, everyone was great. No, it's not as action packed as ""Titanic"" or ""Star Wars,"" but that's what makes it so great. These actors carried it off because of their raw talent; pure and simple. I think this movie should have beaten ""American Beauty."" That picture disturbed me to the point where I was actually nauseated. It's alright though.

This is by far the best movie I have ever watched together with Seabiscuit. The emotional level is beyond anything anyone could ever even think of feeling, historically it's not too complex but does not miss out on anything that suits the period that it is set in. Acting is of highest quality, not only Tom Hanks, EVERYONE. I could sit and watch this movie even if it was 100 hours long and I wouldn't ever want it to finish. It generates such melancholy and flows of sudden emotional spasms that are needed in some cases. It is the kind of melancholy that some people want to last forever because it is so deep that we are capable of feeling something higher than ever before. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is into heavy, painful, sad but amazingly DEEP movies. I also suggest The Pianist, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Good Will Hunting..etc."

The Green Mile is the remarkable story of the cell block's head guard Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), who develops an unusual relationship with an inmate named John Coffey (Michael Duncan), who possesses the spiritual gift of healing and supernatural insight. <br/><br/>The movie is very complex in both innocence and evilness. The character essence of all actors was outstanding because they made the audience believe that in this world there is a great deal of good and evil in all aspects of life. There is a tremendous amount of irony because not only they executed an innocent man, but also a savior that had the power to heal.<br/><br/>The acting done by Michael Duncan was outstanding because his physical appearance is of a very strong muscled black man; however, he had to play the role of a child-like innocent person that is often scared of the dark. He would laugh and embrace the moments when a pet mouse owned by another prisoner would perform tricks in the cells. There were times in the movie that he would think about all the horrors in the world and how he knows the pain of innocent people. One day, he cried about a murderer that was also an inmate, called Wild Bill (Sam Rockwell). Sam played a good role in being the evil, cruel murderer of the two girls. John cried because his supernatural powers gave him the ability to see what Wild Bill did to two innocent little girls. At one point John grabbed Paul's hand, which he called ""boss"" and through his powers allowed Paul to see what happened to the little girls. <br/><br/>In other times he cried and suffer over the abused that a guard name Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison). All the other prison guards felt they had an unpleasant job witnessing brutal electrocution of men that were sincerely undignified and sorry for what they had done. However, Percy was a very sadistic evil man that took comfort in making the prisoners that are in death row suffer by antagonizing them and took pleasure in seeing them walk their last steps heading towards the electric chair. <br/><br/>John does not say where exactly he's from. He is a southern man with very genuine good-hearted manners. The movie is set in rural Louisiana, back in 1935, in a prison called Cold Mountain Correctional Facility. Because of its dull-green linoleum tiles headed straight towards the death chamber, it earned the odd nickname ""The Green Mile."" <br/><br/>The Green Mile has music that was used back in the 1930's. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' character type of Band like music. The music at that time had an appearance of being ""clean cut"" music that people like our great grandparents enjoyed dancing to. A scene that the director used for a visual special affect was when John was sitting in his cell and a beam of sunlight was shined on him making him stand out like an angel. <br/><br/>In conclusion, John's tribulations of watching the bad of the world and trying to heal everyone had exhausted him. He literally sucked out illnesses and dark souls out of everyone's mouth with a strong divine light and then opened his mouth and released that evil into the air into what it seemed like a swarm of flies. It looked very miraculous. In the end, his death puts a great guilt on Paul's soul. Even though the white folks condemned him, John finds peace in knowing that his innocence has served good to all the people he helped."
"mariasacouto","10","1","3","17 February 2007"," a story within many stories
","only recently have I seen this movie, and I must say that despite the excellent performances of the characters, this story reveals to be a huge lesson of life. this is the story of the contrast between life(portrayed by the guards) and death(convicts). there's a lot of emotions mixed : revolt, anger, despise, contempt, love, self survival..and humor. the movie represents the American mentality of the thirties, that is, no respect for human life. the motto was to punish and revenge and not restore and re-educate to integration. apart from other comments I've read, I think Paul happens to be human; he treats the convicts with some kind of mercy and humanity, as he understands they are no longer alive inside that prison."
"aliceboy","8","1","3","22 June 2006"," A film worth watching
","I remember hearing so much about this movie when it came out, and I have wanted to see it about that long but just never got around to it. It was only by chance I finally did see it on TV (uncut, 'cause I'm in Sweden), and it was well worth the wait. It should be said right up front that I haven't read the book, and never will. I'm not that big a Stephen King fan, and haven't really been into him since I was in my early teens. So, I have no idea how much of him or his book has made it into this adaptation, and can only deal with the film on its own merits. Chief among these, of course, is Michael Clarke Duncan. His performance here is an utter revelation from the moment we see his face. The expression he manages to work into a largely expressionless character is astonishing, and that first look at him conveys volumes about who this man is. How Duncan didn't end up having excellent roles thrown his way after this I can't imagine. Oh wait, yes I can: he's huge and black, and Hollywood has no imagination to be able to cast him as much beyond a huge, black man. (It's like Don Cheadle all over again -- except he's small and black -- but still an amazingly talented actor who'll never get the roles he should just for those reasons.) At least he had this one time to shine, and he completely steals this movie. That he lost the Oscar to Michael Caine (who was playing...himself) is just another indication of how worthless the Academy Awards are in rewarding actual talent. He handles John Coffey with a subtlety that, frankly, the role didn't require of him. It's a shame the same couldn't be said for the rest of the cast. Most of the actors gave their roles just what was expected and no more, making the characters come across too often as parodies of who the humans would be. Another standout in 'Green Mile,' though, was Sam Rockwell. His role is King's too-typical crazy redneck, but he uses it as a showcase for some of his most outrageous abilities. It's easy to completely hate this guy, and that's all the more credit to Rockwell. (Compare this to Percy, who's meant to be contemptible, but too often just feels pathetic.) Again, why is this guy's name not on every moviegoers lips? This time, one has to assume it's because he's not leading man material and just has the chops (see also, Gary Oldman). This movie runs just over three hours, and this is one of those happy occasions when the time breezes by (compared to, say, the torturous and totally unnecessary length of Jackson's masturbatory 'King Kong'). The plot never drags, the photography -- though a little Speilbergishly sepia -- is lush and warm and Thomas Newman's score (recognisable from miles away) is sparse and effective. The direction was clearly lacking, most evident in the absence of better performances on the whole, not surprising looking at Darabont's resume. I would absolutely recommend this film, which is something I'd almost never say. It's an all-around viewable piece of work, and a perfectly benign popcorn flick."

","First of all, I thought that everyone gave an outstanding performance... especially Michael Clarke Duncan and Tom Hanks. Their performances were the most moving in my opinion. I was really amazed by John's (Michael Clarke Duncan) faith healing power. Also, I found some things funny. These included Wild Bill (Sam Rockwell) being out of control when he first arrived and Percy (Doug Hutchison) getting his comeuppance after being so violent. The only thing I was scared of was some of the violence... especially Percy's violent ways. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie. In conclusion, THE GREEN MILE was a very touching movie. If you haven't seen it, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it."
"jguerracastillo","10","1","3","3 November 2005"," A Masterpiece
","The Green Mile is a truly piece of art as a film, few movies are so complex, emotive and so damn well acted like this one. Frank Darabont did a amazing job adapting this highly well written novel to the screenplay and ""bravo"" for him as a director as well. I consider myself not a fan of Tom Hanks but his acting here is impeccable and is hand to hand with his performing in the film Philadelphya perhaps his best. In The Green Mile happens something that doesn't happens so often in movies and it lies in the acting each and every actor in this film did a stunning amazing job, lets face it no one looks less than the other and that is what makes this movie outstanding and grateful. Doug Hutchinson was so fine as Percy and he made his character just as the same one we can find in the book if not better, we all hate him eh? The Late Michael Jeter was excellent as Delacroix and his acting here is one of the best in the film, we could almost feel his love for this another great actor, the little mouse jingle, his partner in cell, even the mouse did it well I think Jeter was the right choice for the Delacroix role, damn he is Delacroix my respect for him wherever his is now. Michael Duncan as the giant healer Jhon Coffey give us his best performance to date i know a lot of people who broke in tears when his character was executed on the electric chair and that tell us how well portrayed was Jhon Coffey by Mister Duncan ""A real God creation"" says Tom Hank on the film. Sam Rockwell's performance , in my opinion, is the best in all the film his portrayal as the disgusting, lunatic ""Wild Bill"" Wharton was very very amazing and he really stole the show, what a crazy guy this Sam Rockwell hehe. Besides the acting in The Green Mile everything seems to be right the sets are perfect, the cameras shots excellent, the editing work was great as well the audio too, no big special effects, everything seems so real and in place, and one of the most important thing an amazing great screenplay, a very complex movie for fine tastes. This is one of those few films that you can watch once or two times per year and still finding new things on it and still getting stunned by the acting work, Frank Darabont really deserved an Oscar for his directing here I don't understand why he did not won. For those movies or Stephen king's fans who haven't seen Green Mile yet i recommend them to go out and rent it or buy it you won't regret it, without any doubt one of the biggest achieves for a DVD collector.This one of the greatest king's novel and it is perfectly adapted to the big screen as it should be a really worthy ten of ten. Great for Darabont and company they did a fantastic job."
"blackanese7","10","1","3","20 October 2005"," Good movie
","This is one of the best movies that I have seen. I remember when I first watched it my momma came in asked what was wrong with me because I was crying so loud. It feels like a movie about how God works His miracles in people and that you may never know when angels might be surrounding us. The scene that touched me the most is how Micheal Duncan wanted to leave this earth. There was so much violence and hate that it was so hard to have a decent life. It made me think about my existence in the world. Racism is still out there, but that should only motivate me to do better in life. The movie teaches a person a lesson. Good actors and great storyline. I give this movie an A!!"
"browningbrian","9","1","3","18 October 2005"," One of the best: The Green Mile
","In the movie The Green Mile there were many actors who deserved many awards. There are top actors like Tom Hanks and Micheal Clark Duncan. . Duncan played a role as the ""bad"" person were he was nailed for committing a crime. He had powers to heal people and that was all he was trying to do. Tom Hanks played the officer who had to take care of him. Hanks had his own experience with Duncan and knew that he was a good man. This movie shows people not to believe everything until you find out the truth. All and all this was a great movie that had so many great scenes that you felt like you were right back in time. You could watch this movies over and over again. It is a movie all must see."

","The Green Mile takes place in Texas, USA at a prison of capital punishment. Paul Edgecomb is one of the guys who works at the prison. One day a big man named John Coffey come to the prison. He has been convicted for the murder of two young girls in a nearby village. But his personality is far from a cold-blooded killer. Edgecomb gradually begins to warm to Coffey and begins research as to where he came from and considers the fact that maybe he didn't commit this terrible crime at all, especially when he begins to see the miracles which emanate from Coffey's vicinity. <br/><br/>Paul Edgecomb is the first main character of the film. He's called boss by his partners and he's a very self-controlled and sympathetic man. He has a serious urinary infection and hasn't had the courage to go and talk with a doctor. Maybe he's afraid of hearing that it's incurable. <br/><br/>John Coffey is the second main-character. Even though he is convicted for murder he seems to be a very calm and peaceful person. He has magical powers and his actions are synonymous with Jesus. Percy is the evil man in this movie. Actually he's one of the prison-guards but he's an immature and smug stripling. It's like he doesn't care for anyone and he does everything to satisfy himself. <br/><br/>I think all movies are filled with several messages. So it's very hard to pick out a special message in a movie. In this movie I personally think it's that murderers aren't always bad people. Ed Delacroix is one example. He seems like a good guy in the way he takes care of Mr. Jingles and also in the way he treats Boss and his friends. <br/><br/>Michael Clark Duncan gives an impeccable performance as the good-hearted prisoner John Coffey. Tom Hanks is a disappointment. He gives a rigid performance and is outclassed by the other lead-actors of the movie. I think a 2-times Oscar winning actor could have delivered a much greater performance. The movie is very boring in the beginning but after a magical healing of Paul Edgecomb's urinary infection the movie come to its turning-point. Overall the movie is good. It's a very good description on how it's to be on death row and i recommend it for everyone except those who requires realistic movies."
"filmbuff20","10","1","3","2 January 2005"," Magnificent.
","People have been urging me to see this film for a long time. This film left me absolutely flabbergasted and completely inspired. I have no shame in admitting that I blubbed a bit, and, coming from the most cynical critic when it comes to tearjerkers, that's gotta make a good movie.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is wonderful. He inhabits the part fully and unselfishly, playing off Michael Clarke Duncan who in turn plays off Hanks. They steal every scene they're in and when they're together, pow. The characters seem to be very much akin to the characters of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men (I have mentioned this before in a review of American Beauty). Each is flawed but not all bad, or good but not all good. These characters can invoke both sympathy and hatred in the same damn scene and their actors do them credit.<br/><br/>I'm not surprised that both Darabont and King have come out with yet another winner. I hope they team up again.<br/><br/>I have given this movie a ten, simply because never have I been so emotionally taken with a film and I'm worried that the next film I see will disappoint me because of it. The Green Mile is one to be remembered."

I've got to say, I got quite a hoot from encountering ""Wild Bill"" in the movie. His character is so very colorful in the book, so I looked forward with keen anticipation to seeing how the actor would handle him. And it was...Sam Rockwell! And he played him *perfectly*, SPOT ON. Michael Clarke Duncan is fantastic as John Coffey. Really, everyone is great.<br/><br/>Anyway, go see this movie. It'll give you a boost."
"grahamclarke","Null","1","3","12 July 2004"," Moving and entertaining
","Any film that runs 188 minutes, (most of which is filmed on one set), that holds your interest and hooks you emotionally is certainly doing something right. When all is said and done, ""Green Mile"" simply works. This is no mean achievement.<br/><br/>What makes it all work is a well written screenplay by Frank Darabont, which he has directed with equal ability.  A terrific cast headed by Tom Hanks, with support by David Morse, Michael Jeter, Sam Rockwell and Michael Clarke Duncan make a winning team.<br/><br/>Having firmly established the clear merits of ""The Green Mile"" it should be made equally clear, this is no way a classic. Its treatment of character is shamelessly stereotypical. The bad guys are rotten to the core, while the good guys are angels in disguise. This simplistic perception abounds; no character or storyline overcomes this basically shallow viewpoint.  But while you may be aware of these and other artistic limitations, there is enough magic to compensate. Films were made to entertain and move us. Despite its faults, ""Green Mile"" succeeds extremely well in both these tasks, where so many others fail."

","This movie makes my Top 10 without blinking. It is one of three movies in existence that has broken me down to tears. SPOILERS WITHIN! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. I'll try to keep them light.<br/><br/>This is not your typical Stephen King horror. It's more science-fiction esque. It's about John Coffey, a large black man who has been imprisoned for double homicide. He is brought to ""The Green Mile,"" death row in a small penetentiary.<br/><br/>John Coffey is no average human being. He's a little dim, but he holds a huge secret. He is a healer of sorts, and he demonstrates this ability in instances that will not be easily forgotten. He does things that are simply miraculous, as well as things that are simply interesting and thought provoking.<br/><br/>Some people have been turned off to this movie because of rumors of a gruesome execution scene. It's not gruesome, but it is shocking. To explain, I must introduce Percy. Everyone hates Percy. He's a stuck-up kid who only works at the prison because of his dad, who has a high ranking government position. Basically, anyone who messes with Percy, Percy'll get that guy fired, good man or not.<br/><br/>Now, Percy has explained to him that the electric chair has one very important piece, and that's the sponge that's placed on the person's head who's executed, to make the electricity course through their brain. Percy gets the bright idea to NOT wet the sponge, causing the executed to catch fire, and that in itself is a horrible sight.<br/><br/>Percy gets his dues, and a lot of things are resolved happily; the ending still has entire theatres in tears most of the time, though. That, you will have to see for yourself. Trust me, it'll be worth it."

","""The Green Mile"" ranks as one of the magical masterpieces that has ever been made. ""The Green Mile"" is at the top of my favorites list along with ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Titanic,"" and ""Meet Joe Black."" <br/><br/>Tom Hanks, who gives a phenomenal performance himself might headline ""The Green Mile"" as Paul Edgecomb, but it is David Morse who steps out front and center and steals the spotlight. I have watched Morse since he had been in ""Contact"" and ""The Negotiator"" and my conclusion is that his presence is felt immediately upon entering a scene. <br/><br/>Michael Clarke Duncan's performance as John Coffey, a man filled with hope and miracles, blew me away since it showed how much talent this giant of a young actor really has. Duncan's performance was touching and the best of his career. The plot of this movie is really good because it really does give human faces to the prison guards who have the toughest job of all, which is guarding death row. <br/><br/>The only thing I did not like about this film was 30 minutes longer than it needed to be. For example, the first 30 minutes should have been edited out because I feel it had nothing to do with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>
This has the best ensemble cast of 1999 as well as the best of the year in my opinion. Miracles certainly happen when Tom Hanks appears on screen as proven in ""The Green Mile."""

"eamon-hennedy","10","1","3","1 December 2003"," Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful.
","I love this film, I really, really love it. I don't care about the three hour running time, it flies in for me. It's a prison drama from Frank Darabont and stars Tom Hanks, James Cromwell, Doug Hutchison, Michael Clarke Duncun, David Morse and Gary Sinise. I think this is perfect. The film is moving, spiritual and heavy with religious symbolism and metaphor. It is deeply interesting and weaves a captivating tale of murder and death, healing and resurrection. While the film doesn't have the overlying sense of perfectionism that The Shawshank Redemption had (Darabont's major break is too good a film to better), there is no denying that this is a worthy follow up to a what is a modern day masterpiece. <br/><br/>The film is based on a novel by Stephen King and brilliantly it develops like one. The first hour is pretty slow. Very little seems to happen and Darabont, like a master novelist, takes time in developing the characters that are centered around the plot before actually kick starting it. We are introduced to Edgcombe (Hanks), evil Percy (Hutchison, stealing the film with a portrayal of sheer brutality) easy going Brutus (Morse), charming Warden Hal Moores and his dying wife, Melinda. We see how all these characters lives are to be impacted by convicted murderer John Coffey, a man convicted of killing two school girls, but who is more of a gentle giant and seems to have the capability of healing people (he takes away Edgcombe's bladder problems and brings a mouse back from the dead). It is the way that these characters develop over the second two hours of the film and how the event impact on their lives that make this a fantastic film.<br/><br/>Darabont's handling of the subject matter is superb. This is a deeply moving film, but never, and I mean never, is there a hint of sentimentality about the proceedings. In fact Darabont is prone to making the film a tad more darker and disturbing. An execution gone wrong and the realization as to what really happened to the two girls that Coffey's was accused of murdering give the film a slightly more horrific edge, but then again this is based on a novel by Stephen King so certain aspects are sure to be disturbing in any case. When all is said and done, this is not a horror film. It is an emotional film, one with a raw power to move. With haunting music from Thomas Newman (one of the best composers working today), one of Hanks' best performances and an ending that is equally optimistic but downbeat, this all results in a tremendous film that quite simply wonderful."
"BigFlax","7","1","3","13 October 2003"," The rare film that succeeds in spite of itself
","When just about everything else comes together in a movie, gaping flaws in the premise can often be overcome.  Such is the case in Frank Darabont's second Stephen King prison adaptation, The Green Mile.  It's not just that it's hard to believe a mob of white people with shotguns would have turned a suspected black child killer over to the authorities in 1935 Louisiana, but this is a questionable plot point to start a goofily supernatural story.  This is not to say that a movie can't be done well if it features a Christ metaphor (E.T.) or a somewhat off-the-wall supernatural happening that even the characters seem to be having difficulty reconciling (Field of Dreams), but The Green Mile does not carry its premise as well, in no small part due to how ridiculous it looks when Michael Clarke Duncan grabs Tom Hanks for a minute and then expels a whole bunch of black things.  (Apparently all illnesses are caused by evil and not, say, bacteria or viruses.)<br/><br/>Regrettably, The Green Mile doesn't quite get past the goofiness of the story.  It has some decent (if obvious) lessons to offer, but they're somewhat obscured by the heavy-handed allegory.  The game cast, led by a strong Hanks and filled out with numerous solid performances, does what it can to make up for that problem - and they're mostly successful, also helped by good cinematography and an atmospheric score by Thomas Newman (though Darabont might have avoided some of the inevitable comparisons to The Shawshank Redemption - not nearly all, but perhaps some - if he hadn't hired the same composer and then allowed him to make half his cues sound pulled from the earlier film).<br/><br/>The film's earnestness as regards the story is almost its undoing, but the cast and crew mostly bail out the narrative shortcomings.  The film doesn't even drag at over three hours, which is impressive.  The Green Mile is truly a best-case scenario for defining the term ""elevating the material."""

Reading the novel is one thing, but watching the motion picture is somewhat different. I, personally, have not ever read the novel and never will because of the motion picture. But I'm positive that reading the novel would've given me the same emotional effect that the motion picture (directed by Frank Darabont) has given me. The characters come alive along with the drama, the horror, and the action. It can help non-believers open their eyes and help believers open their eyes even more. It does that effect to me every time I watch The Green Mile and get in touch with the tone, the mood, and the theme that this classic film delivers. An Oscar-worthy classic indeed. Once you can feel the emotional appeals of this movie, then there's no way you can ever turn away from it."
"AslaugRuotsalainen","Null","1","3","16 June 2003"," A very interesting film...you should watch it
","***MILD SPOILERS*** Although it is an amercian film (sorry it wasn't meant in a bad way) this is a film worthwile of thinking about. The plot has been described already so I won't spent too much time on that.<br/><br/>What I find interesting is the ""power"" in the film; the very interesting case with the ""Godly"" power shown by the big black man who's able to make miracles. Showing actually miracles to people who at first don't believe them in any kind of way. Especially the scene with the dead mouse who ""awakens"" again or the healing of people.<br/><br/>It's somehow a film one won't forget, it makes a true impression and one can't help thinking that such things actually can happen if we just trust and believe in them.<br/><br/>We natually also watch nasty things in the prison but it seems that good spirit wins in the end showing all of us that the power and the ""light"" is stronger than anything else. In some way there's of course a religious theme but it never gets too much.<br/><br/>It's a film that makes an everlasting impression and I personally have to admit that I got tears in my eyes watching it because it touches subjects which still are somewhat ""taboo"". The film is also so true in a way; there's no ridiculous scenes and there's also a very serious tone in it.<br/><br/>Being on deathrow definately cannot be anything we can accept and how people mostly are treated is shamefull. The mouse also plays a great role making those terrible conditions the prisonors live under bearable.<br/><br/>Personally I don't find it a typical Hollywood movie because it has a beautiful story.<br/><br/>I will always like this film and admitted...I've seen it more than 10 times since I find new aspects every time.<br/><br/>A special film indeed but always worthwhile watching and then the casting is of course emminent."

I was so wrong. The green mile was definitely the best three hours long i spent for watching a movie. Filled with anxiety, violence and humour this movie is a definite non-misser, and deserves a place in the IMDb top 250 films."

","The best decision made by the makers of this film was to take the screen time to establish all the characters and their relationships with each other. If they had trimmed the movie to the standard two hours, the impact of the story would've been greatly diminished. All the actors are perfectly cast and the important themes are presented in an evenhanded fashion. The emotional payoffs at the end are some of the most rewarding I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. One of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel, 9/10."

","After I saw this movie, i was definitely in aww, how great it was, the philosophy that it taught, the perspective of life it was. Most of you thought it was long, but I thought it went by to fast, some people thought the ending was corny, but I thought the ending was great, and Stephen King found his best muse (in the book: On Writing, by Stephen King, it's good you should read it) and none of his movies could compare to this one. Frank Darabont did a great job, and brought back as much drama as he did in The Shawshank Redmemption. I thought that Michael Clark Duncan made a once in a life time performance, and I would be stunned if Duncan ever acted better than this. Then Tom Hanks was great, his western accent. Even if they don't tell you he was a western folk, you can just tell by his every move. Then the screenplay was great, personally, my favorite line was: ""We've never gone four times in one night since we were nine teen."" And the art direction, oh the art direction was great, it made everything worth the movie, if you didn't have that art direction then the movie wouldn't give you a feeling like you were there. And the guy who playes Wild Billy made a once in a life time performance also, I don't think this actor will get another good role, because if you look at him, he seems sort of punkish, and probably is hard to get him to play the right role. But Frank, did a great job, and the cast director picked definitely the right people for the job, that's pretty much what I've been trying to say through these lines. Then the producer definitely did a fine job, but he did take a risk by putting the sreen time that long, because other people thought it was to long, I read the zagat book and they stated a lot of people thought it was to long (I know it's 3 hours and 8 minutes, but when you are into a movie so much, it goes by so fast). So really what I'm trying to state is that his is and excellent movie, and don't miss out on it, don't care what other people say about it, because I kind of didn't want to see this at first because I heard it was pretty long, and the ending was pretty corny, but I loved, just go for it. I gave this movie a 10, and now I'll shut my skinny white face up."
"ambassadorforhugs","9","1","3","25 March 2003"," Amazing film, not over rated!
","The Green Mile is possibly the best film I've ever seen. It's definitely one of my favourites. After reading some of the cynical and ignorant comments made by others I felt I had to defend the film.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant all round. Some of the performances are under rated but that's what's needed in a film like this. Michael Clark Duncan is especially good in a surprise performance. The direction is competent and engaging. The dialogue is believable and the characters certainly aren't 1-dimensional despite what others think. This is an all round amazing film. I never give films 10/10 but this film almost made it. It was moving, funny, frightening, shocking, thought provoking, involving... the list goes on.<br/><br/>*spoilers*<br/><br/>Now that I've praised the film, I'm going to defend it. How anyone can say this is a sentimental, shallow, ostensibly moral film is beyond me. Only a cynic could say such a thing. Is there something wrong with good nature! Is it unbelievable that there are still some nice people in the world. Not all prison guards are nasty and brutal. Not every prisoner on death row is ""evil"". Not every white person in Louisiana was a racist in the '30's. These are narrow minded ideas. John Coffey is not used to represent a black man whose only role is to help white people despite having supernatural powers so he can help himself. The fact that he is symbolic of Jesus shows that he is a meant to be a great character despite his simplicity and misfortunes. The guards hold him in high regard. How can anyone consider this to be a racist film.<br/><br/>Some comments are a little unfair, but understandable. The film is long and is slow to begin with but the story and characters have to be introduced and developed. The beginning and end are good as the beginning shows how memorable the events in the film are to Edgecomb(e.g the dream and the reaction to the film) and the end shows us how things don't always work out for the best (e.g Coffey's execution and Edgecomb's speech) and a blessing might turn out to be a curse (or vice-versa) so things aren't always what they seem (e.g Edgecomb's speech). There are too many films with happy endings. Although I've already argued that some people are cynical (see above) I would have to say that I'm fed up with every single film having a happy ending - no matter what. As sad it sounds, bad things do happen to good people and the reason for the sad ending is to show why capital punishment should be stopped and to demonstrate that Edgecomb is being punished for letting Coffey die.<br/><br/>I have to say, the only problem I have with the film is the religious undertones. Being anti-religion I would've preferred them to have been left out, but the film isn't promoting religion (the guards are religious but this is '30's Louisiana, of course they're Christians, and it's never confirmed that Coffey is a ""miracle of god""). Everything religious is a reflection on the characters beliefs and not necessarily that of King's or Darabont's (or anyone else's) and is not in your face.<br/><br/>I think I've said all I needed to.<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10 almost 10/10"
"Jack the Ripper1888","10","1","3","23 December 2002"," Amazing movie. Sure to be a classic.
","THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stunned audiences around the world. Most people knew Frank Darabont directed it. What most did not know was that the story was based on a Stephen King short story. So, five years later, Frank Darabont took King's big, fat, hairy novel and turned it into a three hour masterpiece entitled THE GREEN MILE.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, Jeffrey DeMunn, Barry Pepper, Patricia Clarkson, Gary Sinese, and Graham Greene star in this emotion and inspiring film. The acting is wonderful. This film is indeed one of the best movies I hav e ever seen. This should have been able to earn itself several Academy Awards, but hey, it's the Academy's decision on what they think is good. Well, they thought this film good enough to get nominated for Best Picture.<br/><br/>The running time on this film is about three hours, so don't start watching it unless you have a lot of time to burn. I have A LOT of time to burn, so I have watched this movie several times already. I like it that much. So, if you liked THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, then you must see this movie! Other King movies of this genre that are good are HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, STAND BY ME and if you like those there's OCTOBER SKY, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE and Frank Darabont's THE MAJESTIC.<br/><br/>THE GREEN MILE: 5/5."
"enmussak","10","1","3","17 December 2002"," Intense emotional manipulation
","Something about this movie really hit home with me, I found it to be very moving.  However, I could see how someone would not approve of it highly. It tiptoes the line between drama and melodrama, but I believe NOT once ventures into the latter (close though).  I thought all of the characters were believable, the least of which was Percy.  Nevertheless, he is a very necessary character even if he is a little over the top with the portrayal of the evil side of things.<br/><br/>The one man enduring all the pains of the world is a common character in many mythologies and I think this movie did so well because viewing a person with that responsibility hits home with everyone.  It did so for me.  This is an easy movie to get into."

","I was disappointed by the false tone of this movie.  Its phoniness stands in stark contrast to the excellent Shawshank Redemption.I guess my feeling about the film is this:  sure, we can pretend that people talk and feel like this and while we're at it we can all put teddy bears in our cars, get fat talking on cell phones while driving around mindlessly and watch wrestling together in sports bars.  Or we could be honest, be grown-ups, be fully human, and acknowledge that this film is mainly false.  But maybe that's just me.  The second half of the film is better than the first, but it feels like the whole thing was made by people walking on egg shells.  Gag."

"EmbracedByJellyfish","10","1","3","28 August 2002"," MUCH better than The Shawshank Redemption!!! for quite a few reasons.
","Before comparing it to The Shawshank Redemption as almost everyone did, I'd like to tell the reasons for this movie being one of my top 5. I'd very like to tell, but... I just have no words. I can't express with my personal thesaurus what I felt after the movie ended, and what I feel now, several WEEKS after watching it. Let's just say I had a hard time coming back from it's world to ours. Every second of it is rivetting, every moment evokes a different emotion, every line is affecting, every scene will leave its mark in your mind. It isn't perfect, no, but the only thing I find fault with is the last scene with the old Tom Hanks' character (way too long, way too detailed... I wish I could have reedited it!) But I don't want to dwell upon this, so I'll just explain why I think Green Mile is much better than The Shawshank Redemption (and why Shawshank doesn't deserve its 2nd place on the IMDB top 250):<br/><br/>1. The most important thing: at first it seems that except of the prison aspect (and the director, and the original writer) Green Mile and Shawshank aren't similar at all. However, they ARE similar - they're both FANTASY. But whilst Green Mile focused on fantasy and produced the best of it, Shawshank pretended to be a realistic drama and completely failed, and I mean FAILED! Eventually The Green Mile's story came out more believable than Shawshank's! (If the last sentence sounds ridiculous to you - try to recall the American History X scenes of Edward Norton's character's prison times and compare them to the events that happened to Andy in The Shawshank Redemption. You'll get it.)<br/><br/>2. The Green Mile is much more EMOTIVE than Shawshank, it evokes a wilder range of feelings. There's MUCH more humor, more drama and even more suspense, even though both movies are pretty predictable. The ending is also not a banal ""happy end"". There are more different characters and the sympathy is greater, we get to know them better then we do in Shawshank.<br/><br/>3. The Green Mile consists from a beautiful exciting story NEXT TO some profound and important issues, such as the death-sentence and death in general. These subjects move anybody immediately, and in Green Mile particularly, as they shown in an EXTREMELY intense and disturbing way. Shawshank, IMO, is lacking these things, this big impact. You maybe get from it some messages about hope and stuff, but they're not as strong and impressive.<br/><br/>4. And finally the actors. With all the (great) respect to Morgan Freeman, nothing can be compared to the remarkable performances of the whole Green Mile cast (don't forget the mouse!:)). Their characters were transferred so well that you could feel for them. Superb, exquisite, those words are too weak to depict Tom Hanks' performance, his incredible facial expressions, his outstanding acting. Every movie is better with Tom Hanks, but this time he surpassed himself. And so is Michael Clarck Duncan (after the whole nine yards.. :))<br/><br/>10/10"
"shaun98","7","1","3","3 April 2002"," Good, but...
","After Darabont's excellent ""Shawshank Redemption,"" ""The Green Mile"" is somewhat of a mixed blessing. It's a good film, but falls short of the high expectations many people had for it. While comparisons are inevitable, it's best not to worry too much about the issue. They're just different stories with similar settings. Still, one must wonder if Darabont is destined to be typecast as a director of Stephen King-related prison movies.<br/><br/>Putting all that aside, it's a good story, to be sure, one that affirms ""Shawshank's"" theme of hope being found under the most difficult circumstances. At times, the film does hit the mark perfectly, be it in a manner that is wrenching, touching, or even magical. The botched execution scene is as terrifying as anything in a traditional horror movie. On the other end of the spectrum, the miracle scenes are a joy to behold. Duncan's performance as a wrongfully accused man with a gift is nothing short of heartbreaking at times. Hanks, Morse, and the rest of the cast deliver solid performances.<br/><br/>I just wish it was a tighter film. The midsection does tend to drag at times, with some characters taking up too much unnecessary screen time. This is especially true of the William Wharton character, one of the most hateful ever to appear in any movie I've seen. However, the final hour is nearly perfect; classic Stephen King.<br/><br/>*** (out of ****)<br/><br/>Released by Castle Rock through Warner Bros."

","I just watched at this movie for the second time, and I must say that this is a really great movie. Of course, the story is unbelievable (I guess that, back in 1935 in USA, a black man like John Coffey, would have been shot far before his trial....), and all is made in this movie to make us break into tears...and it works! I guess that the real strength of this movie is the casting: Hanks, Clarke Duncan, Morse, Hutchison, Jeter, Cromwell, Rockwell are all at their best. Even Gary Sinise, in a little supporting character. And also the little mice... This movie is typical of what american directors do best: a simple story, not too much to think, good guys, a bad guy, and great actors. Worth 9/10 and to be watched again and again. Just a remark from a french: the french accent of Delacroix (Michael Jeter) is anything but french."
"Don-102","5","1","3","12 December 1999"," Spiritually Uplifting, Yet Overall, A Green Bore...
","This highly anticipated film from writer-director Frank Darabont touches on so many aspects of human nature and of human feelings that it cannot satisfy on every level.  THE GREEN MILE is a long film, a film that you realize is long.  This is not good.  Darabont, director of the great SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, thankfully does not try to reenact that picture here.  This is like SHAWSHANK turned inside out.  The guards at the Louisiana State prison are ""nice"" (with the exception of one), and the hero (the incredibly impressive Michael Clarke Duncan) ""John Coffey"" is original like Tim Robbins in SHAWSHANK, but not as resourceful.  He does, however, have an incredible gift that is the backbone for how the audience will feel about him and the predicament he is placed in for the next 3 hours.<br/><br/>The film is simply overkill and tries to dabble in too many different notions of the human condition within these prison walls.  It was done so much more precisely in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION that you can hardly believe the same guy made the two movies.  GREEN MILE would have been better off staying almost entirely on the relationship between Tom Hanks and Duncan, which is really all you will care about.  The performances are all good, but too many characters are introduced and the inevitable is very clearly seen early on. You pretty much know what will happen to each character based on the simple Hollywood variations on good guys and bad guys.  <br/><br/>Duncan, who plays the massive African-American man accused of rape and murder and sentenced to spend his last days on the ""green mile"", the cell block which leads to the electric chair, is quite a find.  He is sure to get Oscar notoriety and deservedly so.  He reminded me a bit of Brock Peters from TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, who was in a very similar situation.  The two performances combined paint one of the ultimate portrayals on film of racial injustice in this country, especially in the 1930's.  The film eventually dips into the supernatural quite impressively and surprisingly, but it is marred by the frequent attempts at humor and the sometimes annoying sub-plots.  See for yourself and decide whether or not you would have edited it differently.<br/><br/>Long pauses and drawn out characterizations are a drain on the viewer's senses as you watch.  There is a gruesome execution scene that quite frankly indents the moral hypocrisy that is the electric chair, into the mind's eye. The scene is shot with such force and brutality, it is hard to watch.  This brings up the point of the film's muddled message about the wrongs of capital punishment.  Are the guards really against it, or is it just when they have grown close to a prisoner when they don't like it?  Again, decide for yourself.<br/><br/>I was disappointed by THE GREEN MILE.  It will no doubt garner a lot of award attention wrongfully.  Frank Darabont loves making films about prison but maybe he has swung just one too many times at that ball.  At times while watching the flick, I thought I should ""get busy living, or get busy dying,"" as said ""Red"" in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  The movie is that boring and that drawn out.  There are exceptional moments (like the tie-in to the year 1935 and the film TOP HAT), but finally, you must have some more passion and more life on the screen for such a story to really work.<br/><br/>Rating: **1/2"

"Steven Reynolds","5","1","3","20 February 2000"," ""...but sometimes, oh God, the Green Mile is so long...""
","Well-acted, nicely shot, and at moments quite moving, ""The Green Mile"" is ultimately undone by its staggering 188 minute running time.  Such languorous pacing adds nothing to the film - except fuel the audience's irritation with an unforgivably predictable plot and some pretty heavy-handed moralizing.  Darabont tries his best to wring some significance out of King's story, but the material ultimately proves to be too slight: this tale could have been capably told in 100 minutes or, better yet, deployed as a 20 minute ""prison life"" vignette in a film such as Darabont's vastly superior ""The Shawshank Redemption.""  Dragging it over three hours stretches the material too thinly, and in the end leaves a potentially deep story looking rather shallow.  This is a good lesson in filmmaking: you can have a fine director, a savvy cinematographer, a marvellous score, an excellent cast, and $60 million to play with - but if you don't have a decent screenplay, then you might as well stay home.  Just ask Kevin Costner.   5/10"

","I can't say that the ""Green Mile"" was a bad movie but it was far from the year's best. Maybe it's just the Anti-Hanks feelings I have but this movie was somewhat lack luster. I didn't care too much for Hanks' performance but then again I don't care for any of his movies. ""Saving Private Ryan"" was no ""Fighting Sullivans"" despite trying to be one, ""Forrest Gump"" had it's moment but I don't think a retard should be given the Best Actor award. This was the guy who played a manchild and played opposite a slobbering dog. But I digress. There wasn't anything that really grabbed my attention, I take that back. The mouse was the only entertaining character in the whole thing. Maybe it would've been better without the King-esque parts, then it would've gained some respect in my opinion. Honestly there's a better movie out there about a black man being thrown in jail for a crime they didn't commit, ""The Hurricane"". Denzel Washington's drama was more gripping and heart warming and Washington's performance was far better than Hanks' hick characters in ""Green Mile"" and ""Forrest Gump"". If Hanks beats out Washington for Best Actor and ""The Green Mile"" beats ""The Hurricane"" then I'm giving up on the Academy all together and sticking to Hong Kong action movies."

","How ""The Green Mile"" can possibly be ranked in the IMDB's Top 30 as of this writing completely escapes me. It's a commendable film for the most part, but lacks the immediacy and intricacy of ""Shawshank Redemption"" (which is nonetheless ALSO hilariously overpraised by IMDB voters) and plods along a little too deliberately. It also sells itself out to schmaltz in the final third. The acting, particularly that of the villains, saves the film; and to be fair the level of sloppy sentiment isn't as pronounced as that of the original book's. In a landmark year of cinematic breakthroughs, though, ""The Green Mile"" was a step backward, the same way ""Titanic"" was."
"mjukr","5","1","3","13 December 1999"," A Tearjerker for sure, but a Manipulative One
","Yes, I had a hard time holding back the tears.  But, when I left the theater I though to myself, ""what the heck were you getting all choked up about?"".<br/><br/>
The film purposely raises one's spirits to the max in one scene, and in the next beats the audience mercilessly with misty drama.  In fact, the entire movie consisted of this exhausting pattern of lift-you-up-then-beat-you-down techniques, and after reflecting back on the film, I felt very manipulated, almost cheated out of my tears.  There was no compelling character depth or sincerity of events that could be perceived as genuinely touching (and deserving of tears), only highly contrived sequences in which the film doesn't compel your emotions, it forces it out of you, even though there is no real substance under the surface melodrama.<br/><br/>It's even more of a surprise that in a THREE HOUR film we learn so very, very little about any of the characters. Even Hanks' character is given very little motivation (why did he become a guard, why did he marry his wife, why is he so kind to the prisoners, and on).  And the supporting characters are given one-dimensional, cliched roles (the brute, the old-timer, the rookie, the sadist).<br/><br/>Accordingly, the supposed center of this spiritual, modern Biblical tale, John Coffey, remains completely in the dark.  If the four guards are as compassionate as the film would have us believe, then why do none of the guards ever actually TALK to Coffey?  No one asks where he is from, or how he grew up, or how he found the girls--they just sort of talk about him while reveling in his miracles; how compassionate is that?<br/><br/>
The focus on the sadistic guard and the lunatic inmate were to heavy--the bonding between Edgecombe and Coffey needed more fleshing out.  It would seem that the mouse (a much overused metaphor in a film very, very concerned about contrasts) received more screen time than Coffey himself; and although this may parallel a certain theme within the picture, it works too harshly against the much needed character development.<br/><br/>This movie yearns to be exhalted as a rich, spiritual journey, but in the end, after all the tears had been shed (or pummeled out), I felt empty and cheated."

","This movie is so pompous and cheesy, that i can't believe it's in the top 250. Although i'm only 30 years old, i'm wondering a lot about the general filmtaste nowadays. There was a time in cinema, i'd say from circa 1945 to 1975 when movies from all over the world had a chance to be seen in the main cinemas. But when the Blockbuster thing started at the end of the 70's and since then the only purpose of Hollywood is to promote a 200 or 300 Mio. movie so intensive that everybody believes this must be the peak of inventive cinema today, since then it is really hard for true filmmakers to get only a little space on the market. I'm not saying that all the Blockbusters are crap, but mostly it's just overblown action nonsense. Hollywood today is not a place for creative film-making, because the producers must be sure to get at least the amount of money back they are investing on it. But how can there be art, when money plays the central role???? And is it necessary that a film costs 200 or 300 Mio. dollars although there is definitely no need for that for making a brilliant and innovative film. For example ""one flew over the cuckoo's nest 1975"" = 4.4 mio. There are loads of movies the costs were uner 100000 dollars, but even then many of these films are uknownn masterpieces!"

His life before, where he came from and why he was like he was but I understand why they did this. I don't think Hollywood has it anymore, the ability to wow an audience on a story rather than special effects. This film is and always will be a treasure.

The story is about a retired prison warden (Tom Hanks) who recalls the time during the Depression when a black inmate (Michael Clarke Duncan), accused of murdering two white girls but blessed with healing powers, arrived on Death Row.<br/><br/>The film is a long, often simplistic but engrossing drama that handles human interest material better than its supernatural aspects; though it can't quite reproduce on celluloid the smell of burning flesh or the agonies of passing kidney stones - both central to the plot - it at least shares one thing with its source: a deep-rooted, fundamental commitment to storytelling. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actor, Best Picture, Best Sound, and Best Adapted Screenplay."

","Usually when movies have a good cast they are not written well, when they have good writers, the cast doesn't perform as well as it should and sometimes when they have both it just doesn't work, But every once in a while a film comes along that makes us cry and changes the way we see things in life. Movies like Schindlers List and The Godfather. Well The Green Mile is flat out one of those movies. <br/><br/>It is Simply amazing, I have never seen a movie that has changed the way I act and think such as this film. It made me appreciate life and those who are around me. Its easily my favorite film. I had to leave a comment for those who were unfortunate enough not yet to see this captivating piece.

","Rated R for violence, language and some sex-related material. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:14A<br/><br/>I have heard that the green mile was up there as one of the greatest prison movies.That and Shawshank redemption which I have not seen.I saw part of the film on TV and loved it.I wanted to watch the rest of the film so I rented it and watched it.I must say the green mile is a fantastic prison movie.It is based on the novel by Stephen King who is one of my favorite authors.I will read the novel very soon.The Green Mile has pretty much anything you would want in a prison film.Its a very powerful drama with a few funny scenes.The film starts off with an old Paul Edgecombe in a retirement home.After watching the film ""Top Hat"" he tells his friend about how he used to be a prison guard in the year 1935.The film is called ""The Green Mile"" because the floor is green.This prison floor has the prisoners who are to be sentenced to death by electric chair.One of the prisoners is John Coffey, a gentile giant who is afraid of the dark.He is convicted of raping and murdering two little girls.The beginning of the film does not show much of John as it does the life in the prison.It shows the prison guards and some of the prisoners on death row.There is also a mouse named Mr.Jingles who befriends a prisoner named Delacroix.We also see a new crazy prisoner named ""Wild Bill"" who messes around with the guards.He is the comic relief of the film.Later in the film we see John's gift of healing.He first heals Paul's urinary infection.There is a sadistic guard named Percy who'se aunt is the wife of the governor of the state.This enables him to pretty much do what he wants.He is very mean spirited as he sabotages Delacroix's execution and makes him suffer greatly.But before he does that he also kills Mr.Jingles.John, however brings him back to life.After the guards know about John's healing powers, they decide to take him out of jail to visit this woman who is dying of cancer.When he sees the guards take John out, Wild Bill grabs him.While he does this,John sees that he is in fact the killer of the two little girls, the crime for which he was convicted for.After John heals the woman and they go back to the prison, John infects Percy with the disease that he took out of the woman.This makes Percy shoot and kill ""Wild Bill"".After, the disease comes out of Percy but this makes him crazy and he gets sent to the mental institution, ironically it is the place where he was offered a job.When Paul wonders why John would do this, John takes his hand and shows Paul how ""Wild Bill"" killed the two girls.This proves his innocence however John wants to die because he does not want to live in a world with all the bad things that go on in it.John ends up getting killed in the electric chair while the guards are all crying.The film then goes back to the present where we find out Paul is 108 years old and him and Mr.Jingles are still alive.However Paul thinks that god is punishing him for not stopping John's execution by making him outlive his friends and family.The Green Mile is an amazing prison film with excellent performances.This film simply has Michael Clarke Duncan's best performance.The acting is all around great.The Green Mile is one of the greatest prison movies of all time and one of the greatest film of 1999."

","I read The book in serial form when it came out and quickly re read it when it was released as a novel.It was Stephen King's finest work to date I thought and I believed he'd have topped it by now.However King to my knowledge has not and the movie version of the Green Mile shows it's author's love as well as Frank Darabont's love for the time period and in helping re create king's Characters and in helping Redefine them Darabont makes a true masterpiece out of the Green Mile you can't but help but watch and feel what the main characters feel.Tom Hanks shows us once again what a great actor he is.In my mind Hanks is this generations James Stewart he can be very good and he can at times underplay a scene just to let the others shine. But as good as Tom Hanks is the kudos for this movie must rightfully go to Michael Clarke Duncan his performance as John Coffey is wonderfully played and Duncan MAKES Coffy's innocence shine thru this man has all the making's to become one of the 21st century's greatest Actors if he is only given a chance and another role like this one to showcase his talent. The Green Mile is touching,warm,and above all else a very realistic portrayal of the very real demons men face everyday. Even in a place like Cold Mountain prison and on Death Row where men await that last walk down the Green Mile."

Tom Hanks was probably hoping for his 3rd oscar, yet his performance is not great. I read the books and thought they were great, but this is a weak, tired effort to translate novella to the screen.

"Alan One","4","1","4","14 January 2000"," THE MOVIE THAT WOULD NOT BE EDITED!!!
","Could it be that The Green Mile is really three hours long?  It only feels like five or six.  But seriously, folks. . . I could take cheap shots all day at this film, but I won't.  There's plenty of more substantial things to dislike about it.<br/><br/>In The Green Mile, the normal routines of a death row cell block in Depression-era Louisiana are upset when John Coffey, a gigantic, yet meek child-murder convict arrives, bringing supernatural healing and empathic abilities.  Coffey is a thinly-veiled religious figure (his initials are J.C., get it?), whose powers cause him to suffer on behalf of humanity. Paul Edgecomb, the morally-centered head guard of the block, is forced to consider issues of guilt, responsibility, and duty.<br/><br/>When asked for a last request, Coffey expresses his desire to see a ""flicker movie,"" something he has only heard about.  In the empty prison theater, he gets to see Fred Estaire and Ginger Rogers dance cheek-to-cheek in their 1935 film Top Hat.  (Interestingly, it was the same scenes that Mia Farrow gazed at longingly at the close of Purple Rose of Cairo to distract her from the train wreck of her life.)  To him, the dancers are ""angels,"" and as he's strapped into the electric chair he intones, ""I'm in heaven. . . ,"" the same line that Estaire sings.  The movies, director Frank Darabount suggests somewhat self-importantly, are a spiritual media that can transport us into an afterlife.<br/><br/>In a film willing to shoulder the responsibility of a believable context, these ideas might bear fruit, but The Green Mile willfully avoids the complexities of its main topic, capital punishment.  Darabount, acting like the Oscar-crazed filmmaker his critics accuse him of being, uses almost every scene in a mad attempt to jerk at the audience's heartstrings.  Such a strategy leaves precious little room for the ambiguity that justifiably clings to the topic.  Darabount has no choice but to portray the convicts (and the other characters, for that matter) as either noble or evil.  With the exception of Coffey, we are not told what their crimes are; their only indication is the anonymous faces in the crowd observing the execution. These yawning gaps in context, in addition to the George Lucas morality, give the film something of the aura of a fairy tale, a distasteful precedent considering the importance of addressing the issues surrounding capital punishment with a firm grounding in reality.<br/><br/>Did I mention that this movie is long?  Not only are we taken through every excruciating detail of each of the three executions, we also get to go through two dry runs.  In lieu of subtlety, Darabount figures the way to our hearts is redundancy.  Does anyone doubt it will work?"

"jboothmillard","7","2","15","7 September 2005"," The Green Mile
","Based on the book by Stephen King, and from director Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, also a King novel), this is another good prison drama with a good cast. The film begins with Old Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer) being reminded of his past by Fred Astaire's Top Hat on TV, and then he starts telling his story. In the 1930's, Paul (Tom Hanks) was a slightly cynical prison guard on Death Row, leading men down ""The Green Mile"", along with guards Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Saving Private Ryan's Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey DeMunn) and the evil Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison). One day the guards meet new prisoner sentenced to death, large, simple-minded John Coffey (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Michael Clarke Duncan). As time goes by the guards start to see that John might not be harmless as people make him out to be, especially after performing the miracles of curing Paul's urinal infection, which was great for his wife Jan (Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt), bringing the pet mouse, Mr. Jingles, of prisoner Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) back to life (after Percy squashed it), and more prominently curing the wife of Warden Hal Moores (Babe's James Cromwell) of her illness. Also, they realise that he is innocent and that (after his death, and Percy made dumb, and a flashback) it was in fact 'Wild Bill' Wharton (Sam Rockwell) that raped and murdered two little girls. So when they ask John what he wants done, let go to escape or face his sentence. He decided that he has had enough of living and seeing the bad sides of life, and he requests a final meal and film (Top Hat obviously). John's emotional death (the electric chair) was number 2 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers. Also starring Dances with Wolves' Graham Greene as Arlen Bitterbuck, Patricia Clarkson as Melinda Moores and Harry Dean Stanton as Toot-Toot. A fantastic cast, a vicious and utterly hateful villain (bastard, prick, arsehole are the best words to describe Percy), some good fantasy moments, and just an unmissable film, even for three hours. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. Very good!"

"Snowgo","5","1","5","14 August 2014"," Another Eruption from Stephen King's Evil Soul
","This is a dark, mean-spirited movie masquerading as something inspirational. Most of the movie takes place in and amongst the death row cells, inmates and guards. The violence is over-the-top, as per usual in any Stephen King product. Usually, when he writes something, any goodness and light in the movie are just props for the evil, which we are slyly manipulated to swallow.<br/><br/>Case-in-point: Michael Clark Duncan's character: An innocent man with healing ability accused of child murder. Only Stephen King would think of that: He is the master of justifying evil, criminal behavior. <br/><br/>Another example of the sleight-of-hand involved in the screenplay is the casting of Tom Hanks, who usually plays the good guy. In this movie, he chooses to look the other way as innocent men are tortured and murdered by a state penal machine.<br/><br/>We all need to think long and hard about what our values are. Our choices in entertainment reflect the kind of family we came from; how we were raised. Moreover, we need to be vigilant of sly artists who have a talent for deception: Capital punishment is murder. Including a hands-on healer was a cheap tactic to get good, moral people to watch the movie or buy the book. Stephen King is a sick man and we need to see clearly."

","What is The Green Mile? It's an extended flashback wherein a man in a rest home relates his youth as a death row prison guard in 30s Louisiana, and in particular his experience at the hands of John Coffey. Coffey is a colossal black simpleton who's in for the rape and murder of two white girls, but this is Hollywood circa 1999 so obviously he never done it. On the other hand he has a third eye, can project third-person footage of past events directly onto your mind by grabbing your pods, and can cure anything from the clap to inoperable brain tumours to a malfunctioning moral conscience by inhaling the bad from out of your body, then expelling it as a large swarm of insects (?) He can also bring pulverised mice back from the dead. But not two murdered girls, mind you, because they had been dead for 'too long' and that would just be silly.<br/><br/>I know Stephen King novels are notoriously hard to adapt, but...<br/><br/>With two exceptions, all the major figures in TGM, including, for all we are shown, the condemned men, are Good. They attempt to do the right thing without fail regardless of consequences, or they are endearingly simple, or, as in Black Jesus' case, both. The two exceptions are such laughable caricatures of evil they might as well have the word of curse tattooed across their foreheads; such manichaean nonsense is not the stuff of great films. All the considerable acting talent on display in this film can't quite bring these cardboard characters to life.<br/><br/>The good guys may be Good but they're not particularly effective. They react to the grossest provocations (such as being urinated over by a lag, which I expect would earn you a good kicking in most jurisdictions even today) with stoical good humour such that at times the film succeeds in making a Depression era execution block look like a Butlins run by the Keystone Kops.<br/><br/>I took leave of the film at the point when Hanks' character, concerned about his boss' wife's cancer, invites his work buddies to breakfast on the lawn, where he outlines his plan to a) remove what as far as everyone in the world is concerned is a double child rapist / murderer from his cell and take him out on the road b) dope another prisoner to cover their tracks and c) lock one of their own colleagues, who is out of the loop, in solitary for the duration, there to produce realistic bangs and moans in order to lead the other prisoners to think (b) is in there instead. All on the off-chance that a man who resurrected a squashed mouse and fixed Hanks' genito-urinary system might be able to cure cancer into the bargain.<br/><br/>Needless to say, they agree to this gargantuan lapse of professionalism and sanity almost without hesitation. The obvious question is raised and dismissed in a single sentence. Why not ask the boss to bring her into the prison instead? Because he's cautious and sceptical and therefore wouldn't go for it (who could blame him, really?) But even smashing his door in while he was out, force-feeding his wife sedatives and dragging her to the jail bound and gagged would make more practical sense.<br/><br/>What they do instead, then, is to doorstep him, with Coffey, completely unannounced in the wee hours of the morning. Because obviously he is far more likely to react favourably to a home invasion than a polite suggestion over the water cooler. Mr Cautious emerges with a shotgun in a state of some alarm, as one would in the circumstances. But for all his front he still lets them into the house and up the stairs. Now call me wacky but if several men tipped up in uniform at stupid o'clock with a giant murderer in tow who I didn't have a prayer of stopping by physical means, hell bent on entering my terminally ill wife's bedroom with God knows what in mind, but I had a gun to hand I'd have shot every one of the bastards half a dozen times before they got within arm's length.<br/><br/>But anyway. Incidentally, the way that Wetmore is set up as a cartoonish prick so that we are almost forced to applaud when his colleagues turn on him is more than ironic for a film that's supposed to warn us against kneejerk reactions.<br/><br/>Watching this film, in fact, reminded me how far we have come since the late 90s. TGM with its crude mixture of political correctness and dewy- eyed sentimentality wouldn't pass muster in this age of withering cynicism. I'm not Spike Lee's biggest fan but his criticism of Coffey's character as the archetypal Magickal Negro was on point.<br/><br/>Finally, if anyone actually changed their mind about the death penalty on the strength of a film with about as much grounding in reality as Who Framed Roger Rabbit they need to have their right to vote revoked.<br/><br/>Two stars for some very solid performances, one more because my wife liked it, plus 'tilt' because the main man died recently and seemed like the kind of fellow you could set your watch by."

","Death-row prison guard Paul Edgecomb (Hanks) and his kind-hearted colleagues on E block's Green Mile (the path from the cells to the electric chair) have their routine disrupted by new inmates, a friendly mouse, a maliciously unprofessional coworker and a series of supernatural events.<br/><br/>Set in Depression-era Louisiana, the Green Mile tells several human stories, all of them touched by E block's new tenant, John Coffey, a hulking black man accused of killing twin girls. The more his captors get to know this gentle giant, the more they're convinced of his innocence. John soon displays a miraculous gift of healing, creating internal conflict for the men who must oversee his execution.<br/><br/>Based on a story by horror scribe Stephen King, this 3-hour film has a lot going for it. Motifs of good vs. evil dominate, contrasting warm, selfless characters with others who personify humanity's ugliness. It also credits God with endowing miracle workers.<br/><br/>What's disappointing about The Green Mile is its abrasive flip side. The same people who acknowledge divine power are quick to use God's name profanely. Obscenities, as well as ribald sexual and anatomical references, tarnish the dialogue. Graphic depictions of urination, erotica and violence (brutal electrocutions the most unsettling) could have left more to the audience's imagination.<br/><br/>Despite moments of uplift, The Green Mile suffers from harsh elements and a frustratingly bittersweet climax. Some great scenes, but the lasting impression is like heartburn after a fairly satisfying meal.<br/><br/>5/10 Enjoyed the casting & the miracles, don't like the hypocrisy, blasphemy, cursing, or confusing characters."
"eyesour","3","1","6","17 June 2012"," Punishing.
","Excellent movie for those who relish suffering; both when watching it and from feeling empathetic pain themselves. Very suitable for either sadists or masochists, and all people who feel a strong need to cry. Brought to you by the same team that created The Shawshank Redemption, of which it is the obverse. Something like the Passion of the Christ. Shawshank described how one man beat the U.S. system, all on his own, and escaped injustice to freedom. It was almost plausible, and positively upbeat. The Green Mile describes how the U.S. system crushes innocence and saintliness, as well as how (some of) the guilty are made to pay for their sins. To be perfectly honest, it is messy. It doesn't make you feel good, and it's a sort of a snuff movie, apparently designed to make you a little sick. If you're normal.<br/><br/>It is also completely implausible, and contains any amount of utterly ridiculous miracle-working, some involving the healing of peculiarly repulsive ailments, as well as a gaggle of exceptionally talented circus mice. Presumably this is in homage to Steinbeck's ""Mice and Men"". The leading character, Hanks, is inexplicably condemned to immortality, although, at 108, and not looking much like his earlier self, the impression is that he's only got about another 5 years to go, at most. Perhaps because the subject-matter was so dippy and off-putting, I kept getting distracted. How did they manage to make an actor, who is in fact a mere 6 ft 5 inches tall, unconvincingly look as though he were eight foot? I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the photographic trickery, and noting how and when it didn't quite work, just like I did with Malkovich, in ""Of Mice and Men"". I also found myself frequently looking at the time, and wondering how much longer there was to go.<br/><br/>There may be an anti-capital punishment message involved, but the only miracle in connection with this movie is how it gets to #71 in the top 250. Watch Top Hat, instead."
"itai195","3","1","6","20 August 2000"," Am I missing something?
","This movie was one of the most terribly formulaic movies I've seen in years. It's basically Saving Private Ryan or Titanic's beginning and ending with a different plot thrown in the middle.  While that's always been a typical formula, due to the abundance in recent years of similar films it's just not excusable anymore.  Add to that the trademark, Hollywood cliche mix of cute, out of place humor and overly sentimental drama thrown in throughout the film and you've got one of the most overrated movies of the year.  True, most of 1999's best movies (Magnolia, Cider House Rules, American Beauty, Boys Don't Cry) were also overly sentimental, but at least they had worthwhile messages.  The best The Green Mile can muster is something like a trite ""don't judge a book by its cover"" or the even more annoying ""don't be mean to convicted killers, it hurts their feelings.""  Don't get me wrong, it's not that I wasn't disgusted by the treatment these men received (I'm not even an advocate of capital punishment), it's just the way the film handled these situations that made me gag.<br/><br/>I really did want to like this film as the acting is superb and the technical elements are all in place, but the contrived plot constantly detracted from the film's overall quality.  If you want to see one of 1999's truly good films, I recommend seeing one or all of the movies I mentioned above.  This certainly isn't anywhere near the quality of Frank Darabont's true masterpiece, The Shawshank Redemption."

Weird ending, too. Individual performances are solid if undistinguished. Brutal, played by one of my favorite actors, David Morse, has that slightly sinister vibe going on.

","The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison. His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book. The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that. I can't understand the complaints. The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long. The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing. Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes."

","First and foremost I would very much like to appreciate the storyline and the characters created by Stephen King. Such interesting and meticulously created characters were they.<br/><br/>The execution of Del, because of Percy thirst for revenge and purposely does not soak the sponge which he places on Del's head, I was immensely horrified by the convulsion and suffering in pain and while Del suffers so does Coffey, at that moment the direction was over the peak making it very scary.<br/><br/>Three grown men, outsmarted by a mouse.<br/><br/>Men under strain can snap. Hurt themselves and hurt others.<br/><br/>On the day of John's execution when he is taken to the auditorium, he senses immense hostility from the audience: ""They's lot of folks here that hate me. Lots! I can feel it. It's like bee's stinging me."" to which Brutus replies: ""Well, feel how we feel, then. We don't hate you. Can you feel that?"" (simply meaning the guards have nothing but sympathy for him).<br/><br/>My personal favourite is while Paul(Tom Hanks) says Role Two the way his eyes are filled with tear and his jaws tickling were my careful observations."

"connel-00841","10","0","1","21 September 2019"," Moral Analysis
","---THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS---<br/><br/>
The Green Mile is a film about the miracles of John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) told through the eyes of Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks). The movie takes place in a block of a prison ward meant for prisoners that have been sentenced to death for their crimes. One such inmate has been brought in for the murder of two little girls, John Coffey. Through the events that unfold, Paul Edgecomb and his coworker Brutus Howell (David Morse) start to realize that John Coffey may not have been the murder and ultimately discover that, instead, another inmate, ""Wild Bill"" Thorton (Sam Rockwell) was the true murderer. Events unfold and the conclusion leaves the viewer considering the moral conundrum faced within the film. This moral conundrum ends up being the true focus and theme of the movie and that is the issue of wrongful conviction.
Based on the report that Paul received, he too believed John Coffey to be the murderer, however saw him as a simpleton as he was a little slow and didn't seem to have much of an education. This alone could likely be a reference to the wrongful conviction of many of the mentally ill that happened in the past of the U.S. There are cases throughout history of the mentally ill being a target for demonization as well as criminal blame simply because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Further in, after witnessing some the miracles John performs, Paul begins to question if such a person could really turn out to be the murderer he was convicted as until ultimately, he saves the Warden's (James Cromwell) wife (Patricia Clarkson) from a brain tumor and ""shows"" Paul what really happened when the children were murdered. Despite Paul seeing the truth, they have no proof that John didn't commit the murder beyond the vision he shared. This is potentially a reference to how recently, and during the time the book was written, people were likely wrongly convicted for crimes and sentenced to death. We can look up cases where 40 years after a life sentence or a death sentence has been issued, emerging technologies have been able to find new evidence that proves that many of these people were innocent, such as DNA testing and much more thorough and less contaminating investigation methods. With this woven in theme, even if you ignore it, The Green Mile is still an amazing film with great cinematography, using the sheer size of John Coffey as a plot point to people being intimidated by him, creating the gentle giant persona, to the careful treatment of dialogue, asking it so you're on the edge trying to make sure you don't miss a single detail. I believe the film is still a good example of not judging someone by what you hear or by their looks since they may turn out not to be the monster you've been told they are."
"ilanmer","8","0","1","17 September 2019"," Honest review of my experience from the movie
","There is two parts to this movie. Two points of conflict.
The first point is very important and lead to the other. But, it's less appealing.
Don't get me wrong! the story telling and the acting is amazing during this part too. But, as said, it is not that appealing.<br/><br/>The second part is truly amazing. Great plot combining good acting, filming and ending that makes this film truly memorable.<br/><br/>I give it 8 stars because, I had to wait for the second part a bit too long. I didn't get bored, but I cant give it higher score because of this. Rated it by my experience first and foremost."
"elen-gevorgyan","10","0","2","15 September 2019"," One of the deepest movies I have ever watched.
","As a person who prefers romantic, light movies, I was astonished by the depth of this fascinating movie. The excellent performance of the actors made me speechless. I saw death in the eyes of the prisoners who were waiting for their execution. The unique storyline made me think of the concept of life once again. Indeed, life is a waiting period for death. We live watching straight into the eyes of death, just like those prisoners who were sentenced to death and were calmly listening to the sound of steps that would pick someone to execute. The metaphor is that we likewise are the prisoner of a small room that is tightly restrained by our thoughts. No matter how much good we do in our lives, we can do nothing when our moment comes.
I also wondered how heartless people were back then to be able to sentence another human being to death. But it made me even more disappointed in people realizing that this practice is legal in some countries even now."

","The green mile is a prison drama directed and written by frank darabount adapted from the stephen king story of the same name. Now you may know frank darabount from the mist, and you almost definetly know him from directing the shawshank redemption. The shawshank redemption is a true classic often counted among the greatest films ever made, and in my humble opinion it is the greatest film ever made. So hes coming off of that momumental film and you wonder ""how the hell is he gonna live up to that? Its another prison story set in the early 1900s, can he ever live up to shawshank?<br/><br/>Yeah. It does. Seriosuly the green mile is one of the best films ever made. Frano darabount just continues to impress. Hes made another film with incredible acting, pitch perfect camera work, hard hitting emotional moments, and unlike shawshank some really good visual and in camera effects. I highly recomend the ""magic of the mile"" it had some really good insight into the filming proccess. Lets talk about michal clark duncan.  He is oscar worthy and then some he is that good. Another great performance is doug hutchison. Its kind of easy to forget about how good he is because his character is so despicable, so hate-able, good god I dont think theres ever been a movie character thats made me want to punch something so much! Tom hanks is also incredible as paul edgecomb. I dont think its controversial to call tom hanks one of the greatest actors alive and in a carreer that includes saving private ryan,forest gump,philidelphia and captain philips this might be the best performance in his career. I highly recomend this movie, it is 3 hours long but belive me when I tell you it doesnt feel that way. I know alot of people say that about movies like the godfather and lawrence of arabia and there usually wrong but belive me its a relatevly easy watch if you dont mind crying your eyes out."

","""The Green Mile"" is another jailhouse movie adapted from a novel written by Stephen King. It's not a horror movie although there are some gruesome scenes within.<br/><br/>Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the head of a group of prison guards in charge of death row in a Louisiana State Prison. The story chronicles their day to day activities and interactions with the prisoners. One day a huge but mild mannered black prisoner John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) convicted of murdering two little girls. Smart ass guard Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchinson) makes fun of the giant.<br/><br/>Edgecomb and his co-workers Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper) and Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey DeMunn) along with Wetmore are charged with executing prisoners on their assigned date. A ""dry run"" with trustee Toot-Toot (Harry Dean Stanton) standing for the convicted prisoner is carried out to ensure that everything is in order. The first execution is that of Arlen Bitterbuck (Grahame Green) which is carried out according to law.<br/><br/>Later, a rebellious prisoner named ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Sam Rockwell) is brought in. He is truly rotten and unrepentant. A small mouse is running rampant within the block. Wetmore promises to eliminate the rodent. However, another prisoner Eduard (Del) Delacroix (Michael Jeter) takes a liking to the mouse and names him Mr. Jingles.<br/><br/>Edgecomb has been suffering from an painful urinary disorder, Coffey and Edgecomb have developed a mutual respect for each other. One day Coffey grabs Edgecomb and for the want of a different term, ""mind melds"" with him. Edgecomb to his surprise discovers that the pain is gone and that he can one again function as a man, much to the delight of his wife Jan (Bonnie Hunt).<br/><br/>As Del's execution date approaches, Mr. Jingles escapes and is crushed under the foot of Wetmore. Del is totally distraught but Coffey asks that the seemingly dead mouse be brought to him. He manages to revive the mouse much to the amazement of all. Later, as Del is led away to the execution chamber, Wetmore plans a particularly gruesome finish for Del. Edgecomb and the others are upset of the way Del died but are unable to remove Wetmore due to his ""connections"".<br/><br/>Warden Hal Morris (James Cromwell) is a friend of Edgecomb. Morris's wife (Patricia Clarkson) is suffering from a brain tumor. Edgecomb impressed bt Coffey's apparent powers, hatches a plan to bring Coffey to Morris' home. He manages to do so and Coffey is able to cure the ailing woman.<br/><br/>As Coffey's execution date nears, he has first a score to settle with Wetstone and Wharton which is accomplished in an unusual way. Later in another ""mind meld"" with Edgecomb, Edgecomb learns of Coffey's situation through a flash back and learns who the real murderer was.<br/><br/>An impeccable cast right from Tom Hanks right down to veteran character actor Dabbs Greer who play Hanks at an advanced age. Sam Rockwell stands out as the hateful ""Wild Bill"" Wharton as does Doug Hutchinson as the truly unlikeable Percy Wetmore. Michael Jeter, whose execution scene is truly graphic, also stands out. William Sadler also appears as the distraught father of the slain girls and Gary Sinese as Coffey's defence attorney.<br/><br/>A truly marvelous film."

","This would've gotten an 8 if it hadn't been for the warden's refusal to let John go upstairs to his wife. The warden explained earlier in the movie that she has a tumor in her head and is going to die; it's inevitable, barring some sort of miracle. Particularly when they bring big John over, all we hear from her up there in bed in pain and agony. She's in HELL. Therefor, it shouldn't matter to him WHAT John's planning to with/to her. Even if he wasn't there to help but do harm, what more pain could he possibly inflict her with? Even if he was there to KILL, he should submissively let him by because John's guess as to what to do with her would be as good as anyone else's and death would certainly end her misery. When the warden tells him, ""Don't you do it!"" I chuckled, ""Why not? You're wife's in Hell, dude, with no doctoral hope of getting better. I of course know he's going to help her but even I didn't, go for it."""
"Horst_In_Translation","8","0","2","25 July 2017"," Easily one of the best 1990s movies
","""The Green Mile"" is an American movie from 1999, so this one will have its 20th anniversary 2 years from now when I write this review (2017). Let me start by saying that this film runs for over 3 hours, so if very long films aren't your preferred choice, then you can skip it. It's okay, but you are really missing out in that case. The film is based on a novel by Stephen King and the writer is Frank Darabont who launched his career with Stephen King's works and kept going with adaptations for quite a while. Another would obviously be ""The Shawshank Redemption"", the film he made before this one here. Today, Darabont is probably mostly known for his work on ""The Walking Dead"", which is truly ironic looking at how wonderful his works in the 1990s were. As for this one here, I am definitely a bit biased as the cast includes many actors I quite like. This applies not just to lead actor Tom Hanks, but also to Rockwell, Morse, Cromwell and Sinise, even if the latter only has a very brief appearance. And how can you not like Michael Jeter and Michael Clarke Duncan after their performances in here. May they rest in peace. MCD is the only one who scored an Oscar nomination from the cast and this is also his career/life-defining performance for sure. The movie itself was nominated for four Oscars, but did not win any sadly.<br/><br/>I think that it may be difficult at times to appreciate the fantasy aspects in this film and with that i am referring mostly to the healing scenes. The film otherwise relies on very dark, very gritty and realistic plot developments because after all the entire thing takes place at a Death Row prison. But maybe it is this contrast between evil and goodness that lets it work so well. There were honestly more than just a few scenes and moments when I felt that they will really struggle to make this work, but they did succeed every time. Another example would be the frame between start and ending that plays many decades after the events at the prison, but when the closing credits rolled in I was very touched. I would also like to say that the film despite its massive runtime never drags a bit. It is truly easy to care for the characters and wonder what is going to happen next to them and this includes the good ones as well as the bad ones and there are good and bad ones at both sides of the law in here. The prime example is of course Doug Hutchinson's character, who is a bit of a main antagonist next to Rockwell certainly. It's a bit of a shame that the former did not really manage a great career and that people instead talked about nothing but his personal relationships. He was so good in here.<br/><br/>I also do believe that another huge strength of the film is the location, namely the prison. There is always an aura of imprisonment and narrowness surrounding this film, also when it comes to the guards. And I personally felt that the film always got a bit weaker for a moment when the action moved outside the prison, like the scene with Clarkson's character or the big jump forward in time. But maybe that's just me. The location is truly special in terms of the overall plot in here. The most heartbreaking moments are the execution scenes, the one with MCD's character, but also the one with Jeter's character. That one was painfully good and you could not watch anywhere else, even if your heart was breaking during it. It was basically a longer more intense version of the rodent-killing scene from right before that. Or maybe I should say ""killing"". So yeah, for me this was an outstanding movie and I believe everybody needs to see it. Then again, looking at the number of ratings this film has here on IMDb, almost everybody has seen it and the few who have not really need to change that as soon as possible. This film is a masterpiece and a definite contender for best film from the year 2009 (the decade sure went out on a strong note) and also for Top10 of the 1990s. What are you waiting for? Don't be scared of the duration. Be grateful it is so long because it is good from start to finish. Also a contender for best film of Tom Hanks' career and that means quite something. (Re-)Watch it!"

","Originally a Stephen King novel, this conversion to a movie was transformed to perfection. I think this one has to be one of the best Jail- type films, right below Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>We got the performance we've come to expect from the great Tom Hanks, but the real sleeper hero of a performance here was by Michael Clarke Duncan. You can't help but feel his emotions and sympathize with his character. Truly an outstanding performance. He deserved all his nominations and I wished he had one the Oscar for this film. His performance alone is the only reason anyone needs to see this film. <br/><br/>I only wish the pace of the entire film was a little faster, and the 189 mins was much, but overall still a great film! <br/><br/>A well deserved 9/10 from me!"

By no means is it a ""perfect movie"" (because that's practically impossible) but this is pretty damn close. I knew I was meant to watch this movie, and I don't believe in fate. The acting goes above and beyond, especially considering Michael Clarke Duncan (RIP, buddy), Sam Rockwell, Tom Hanks (duh) and even the rest of the cast is on point (such as David Morse or Mr. Noodles or Mr. Jingles). Even just watching this movie makes me proud of cinema, of all those who were involved in the creation of this classic. Nice to look at, an intriguing plot, and characters easy to fall into due to their tangibility. Very well crafted passion-project. I saw this for the first time with my mother two years ago, and even today watching the trailer makes me emotional. It was raining outside as the movie wrapped up, we were hugging and crying hysterically. It's a hard watch, but you can't help but keep watching.

"smy-23888","10","0","1","3 March 2017"," The Green-Blue Mile
","There are few movies I have watched that have completely indulged me in my emotions. The movie ""The Green Mile"" is based around a cell block where all of the prisoners are on death row, particularly a larger than life black man named John Coffey. John has been convicted of brutally murdering two young girls, and is by all means is intimidating simply by appearance. This movie is truly magnificent and movie because of its characters and their situations that are portrayed throughout the film. <br/><br/>Something director Frank Darabont did impeccably was make the audience feel like they had a personal connection to the prisoners in the movie. The movie progresses with the prisoners and prison guards getting to know each other. In this period, prisoners are not portrayed as wastes of society, but rather as actual human beings. Prisoners and prison guards joke around humorously as friends and not enemies, and in these moments the audience feels almost as if they are there, having a good time with the characters in the movie. When each of the characters is getting along and crack jokes at each other it makes the audience almost forget about the fact that these prisoners are on death row. This is possibly what makes this movie just so moving, because throughout the movie each of the prisoners have their executions carried out via electric chair by the very people whom we have seen them laugh and story tell with. I would be lying if I said I didn't shed a few tears and feel my heart swell up each time Paul (Tom Hanks) had to put his past relationship with a prisoner aside and read the prisoner his rights and conviction from prison guard to prisoner. <br/><br/>Each of the prison guard's jaws dropped when John Coffey first stepped out of the police vehicle that drove him to the prison, the car bouncing aggressively due to the huge transfer of weight. John is black, well over six four and looks like he belongs in a bodybuilding contest and is treated as if he were literally a walking weapon. However after multiple situations of John showing a harmless childlike personality, whether it be calling each of the prison personnel ""boss"" or requesting that the lights be left on because he gets scared of the dark, all of the prison guards, along with the audience realizes that John is harmless. In fact, John is not only harmless, but actually the opposite of harmful in curing, because he has the power to fix any physical problems, such as Paul's urinary infection or a prison guard's wife's cancer. Moments like these showed the beauty in life as Paul finally overcame a setback he had for years and the prison guard and his wife were brought back together due to the termination of the previously terminal cancer. Late in the movie it is revealed that John was found with the two girls in his hands not because he killed them, but because he was trying to use his powers to revive them. It was no mistake that the single person in the entire movie who had the power to cure any physical injury and who happened to be polite and as harmless as a butterfly was the man who was unrightfully executed. After watching this movie I had my opinion swayed on one thing in particular, which is the death sentence. Aside from watching numerous characters brutally electrocuted to death by people they would call friends in a different environment, John Coffey's scenario could have single handedly shown me that this punishment is by no means right.<br/><br/>John's execution scene has to be one of the most emotional scenes I have ever been fortunate enough to watch. The scene was filled with tension and regret, sorrow and helplessness, as the group of prison guards are forced to execute John, who was strapped down to a small chair, in front of a small audience knowing well that the man they are about to kill is innocent. <br/><br/>This movie was by all means an extremely emotional roller-coaster. There are happy moments that make it seem like there isn't a problem in the world, and then scenes that make you want to just sit in a corner with a blanket and cry. ""The Green Mile"" is a beautiful movie that shows the greatness in life along with the tragedy that comes with death, which is portrayed through the characters of the film. I would recommend this movie to anyone who can squeeze the three hour run time into their schedule and who is prepared to be seen with red eyes and tear stains down the side of their face for the rest of the day."

","This is a film that took me on a wide variety of emotions. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me get angry, it made me feel joy. This film made me feel bad for murderers on death row. Every performance in the film felt genuine, and the characters were believable. The characters had motives for their actions throughout the film, whether it be as defined as a desire to help when possible, out of hatred for horrible criminals, or just from pure insanity. Each execution felt quite depressing. There were problems with the film, like the continuity of the power of the main character. I'm left to assume that it no longer works after death, but it can cure cancer in a woman that is almost dead. If the main character was faster to get to the dead girls, would he have been able to save them? The power takes up large amounts of energy from the character, but it seems to be just as tiring to cure cancer as it was to cure a urinary tract infection. This film is not perfect, but it is so well done and the imperfections are so few and far between that they hardly become noticeable. This is a well written, well shot film, and it is close to being one of the greatest."

","Frank Darabont has proved himself to be the master of the prison movie he did this with The Shawshank Redemption and he does it here as well with The Green Mile a movie that I absolutely loved. This film is not only very emotional but it's also incredibly intriguing and a large part of that is due to Michael Clarke Duncan's incredible, Oscar Worthy performance here as Jon Coffey. Duncan proved himself to be a great actor but I had never seen anything like this form him, he brings a vulnerability to his character that always has you intrigued when you don't know the whole story yet but I thought Duncan was perfect at portraying the right amount of innocence and his execution scene will really break your heart and I will reiterate that I truly believe he deserved an Oscar for his performance. Tom Hanks was also fantastic in this film, of course since it Tom Hanks he's incredibly likable but through Hanks performance you know that this character is the best at what he does and his scene Duncan really gave him a time to shine. The mystery around Duncan's character is incredibly interesting, you have your suspicions from his first scene but you don't get all the information all at once your given subtle hints slowly and it makes the film all the more interesting to watch. This film also has a fantastic way of humanising its characters, you get the impression that despite what all these men have done they are still human beings who regret their pasts. This film also made me care about a mouse just as much as any of the human characters an that is truly worthy of praise. I loved how this film depicted The Green Mile itself and was all the guards had fantastic chemistry with one and other. The character of Percy is brought in to be a character that you despise and they do succeed at that and I loved how his character came to suffer but I found the resolution of his arc to be very rushed and their isn't really any kind of fallout from it. Now this film is about three hours long and I didn't really feel it until about the last twenty minutes where scenes begin to drag and don't have the same intrigue that the rest of the film had. <br/><br/>I absolutely loved The Green Mile it handles all its characters perfectly, has a fantastic setting, a truly heartwarming message, an extremely interesting mystery and a runtime that goes by very quickly until the last twenty minutes.

","""The Green Mile"" is the best movie on film history, I have ever seen.<br/><br/>""We think of this place like an intensive care ward of a hospital."" So says Paul Edgecomb, who is in charge of Death Row in a Louisiana penitentiary during the Depression. Paul (Tom Hanks) is a nice man, probably nicer than your average Louisiana Death Row guard, and his staff is competent and humane--all except for the loathsome Percy, whose aunt is married to the governor, and who could have any state job he wants, but likes it here because ""he wants to see one cook up close."" One day a new prisoner arrives. He is a gigantic black man, framed by the low-angle camera to loom over the guards and duck under doorways. This is John Coffey (""like the drink, only not spelled the same""), and he has been convicted of molesting and killing two little white girls. From the start it is clear he is not what he seems. He is afraid of the dark, for one thing. He is straightforward in shaking Paul's hand--not like a man with anything to be ashamed of.<br/><br/>This is not a good summer for Paul. He is suffering from a painful infection and suffering, too, because Percy (Doug Hutchison) is like an infection in the ward: ""The man is mean, careless and stupid-- that's a bad combination in a place like this."" Paul sees his duty as regulating a calm and decent atmosphere in which men prepare to die.<br/><br/>""The Green Mile"" (so-called because this Death Row has a green floor) is based on a novel by Stephen King, and has been written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is Darabont's first film since the great ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in 1994. That, too, was based on a King prison story, but this one is very different. It involves the supernatural, for one thing--in a spiritual, not creepy, way.<br/><br/>Both movies center on relationships between a white man and a black man. In ""Shawshank"" the black man was the witness to a white man's dogged determination, and here the black man's function is to absorb the pain of whites--to redeem and forgive them. By the end, when he is asked to forgive them for sending him to the electric chair, the story has so well prepared us that the key scenes play like drama, not metaphor, and that is not an easy thing to achieve.<br/><br/>The movie is told in flashback as the memories of Paul as an old man, now in a retirement home. ""The math doesn't quite work out,"" he admits at one point, and we find out why. The story is in no haste to get to the sensational and supernatural; it takes at least an hour simply to create the relationships in the prison, where Paul's lieutenant (David Morse) is rock-solid and dependable, where the warden (James Cromwell) is good and fair, and where the prisoners include a balmy coot named Delacroix (Michael Jeter) and a taunting monster named Wharton (Sam Rockwell).<br/><br/>Looming over all is the presence of John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a man whose own lawyer says he seems to have ""dropped out of the sky."" Coffey cannot read or write, seems simpleminded, causes no trouble and exudes goodness. The reason Paul consults the lawyer is because he comes to doubt this prisoner could have killed the little girls. Yet Coffey was found with their broken bodies in his huge arms. And in Louisiana in the 1930s, a black man with such evidence against him is not likely to be acquitted by a jury. (We might indeed question whether a Louisiana Death Row in the 1930s would be so fair and hospitable to a convicted child molester, but the story carries its own conviction, and we go along with it.) There are several sequences of powerful emotion in the film. Some of them involve the grisly details of the death chamber, and the process by which the state makes sure that a condemned man will actually die (Harry Dean Stanton has an amusing cameo as a stand-in at a dress rehearsal with the electric chair). One execution is particularly gruesome and seen in some detail; the R rating is earned here, despite the film's generally benevolent tone. Other moments of great impact involve a tame mouse which Delacroix adopts, a violent struggle with Wharton (and his obscene attempts at rabble- rousing), and subplots involving the wives of Paul (Bonnie Hunt) and the warden (Patricia Clarkson)."

","The Green Mile is a prison drama based on the novel The Green Mile by Stephen King. The major characters in the film are: Paul Edgecombe played by Tom Hanks he is the main officer in charge of the inmates that are on death row. Paul is a compassionate officer and tries to keep things calm for the inmates and tries to keep things very orderly. Jan Edgecombe played by Bonnie Hunt is Paul's wife. Jan bakes cornbread for her husband and the inmates. Hal Moores played by James Cromwell is the warden of the Louisiana penitentiary. Hal has an ailing wife at home who suffers from a brain tumor. John Coffey played by Michael Clark Duncan a large black man sentenced to die for raping and killing two small girls, he possess a unique ability to ""feel"" good and evil in the world and has the ability to do miraculous healings. He is a simple person, quiet and even afraid of the dark. Percy Wetmore played by Doug Hutchison is the governor's nephew, he agitates inmates rather than dealing with them with any type of compassion he does several things throughout the film that are just to upset the inmates, one example is stomping on Mr. Jingles. All of the guards dislike Percy. William ""Wild Bill"" Wharton played by Sam Rockwell is a rowdy and rude as well as aggressive inmate with almost a crazy personality, Edward ""Del"" Delacroix played by Michael Jetter is an inmate with a gentler demeanor about him who takes care of and plays with a pet mouse, he knows his execution is drawing near and worries what will happen to Mr. Jingles after he is gone. Mr. Jingles played by a mouse who initially is the pet to Del and is given to John after Del's execution, the mouse is in the movie throughout and with Paul when the flashback returns to Paul telling his wife Jan about the John. Although there are really several themes in this movie from miracles to life and death. The major theme of the movie is good and evil. Throughout the movie it is very easy to see that the characters are defined as being good or evil. This movie utilizes flashback to portray a story of death row inmates specifically the story of John Coffey and his unique ability to heal and take the ""bad"" away from people. Paul is telling his wife Jan, the story of John Coffey, an inmate sentenced to death on the Mile. (He is very large in stature a very big man about 7 feet tall and approximately 300 lbs. The camera angels in the movie are pointed up making him look quite large when they are pointed at him and then turned down when they are looking at the other inmates and officers to portray how huge this man is.) Paul who is the head officer on the mile is a gentle and compassionate person. He tries to treat the inmates with dignity helps to keep things calm. Paul struggles with the morality of having to put John to death as an inmate on death row, knowing that he possesses the ability to heal people. John was convicted of raping and killing two little girls at a home he worked at. He comes to the mile as a simple person, one that is not very educated and gentle, even afraid of the dark. John has a unique gift of being able to heal and see the ""bad"" in the world. Dialog is very important in the film because it makes it easy to understand just who John is. He doesn't use big words and he's soft spoken. Upon coming to the mile he even asks Paul if the lights would be left on because he is afraid of the dark. Paul comes in with a really bad urinary tract infection and John heals it. When he ""takes away"" the infection he blows out a matter out of his mouth and coughs quite a bit. Disbelieving what has just happened, Paul knows it is a miracle and that there is more to John than meets the eye. He continually throughout the movie shows his miracles. At one point Percy steps on Mr. Jingles, Del's mouse and leaves it for dead, John asks for the mouse and revives it in front of Paul. Mr. Jingles heads back to the cell with Del. After Percy botches Del's execution by not wetting the sponge on his head before he is electrocuted prolonging his death and causing him to catch fire, Paul and the others lock him in solitary confinement. During which time Hal's wife has taken a turn for the worse in regards to her brain tumor. Paul and Brutus sneak John out of his cell and take him to Hal's house where John heals her. When Paul asks John about it, John took Paul's hand and showed him a little bit of what he could see, he also gave him a glimpse of what really happened the day he was accused of raping and killing the two little girls. When the time comes before John is to be executed Paul asks him what he should do. He is trying to figure out within himself how he can commit a man with a gift of miracles to die and how he will answer when God asks him why. John tells him he has to do it, and that he is tired. ""Tired of all the ugly"" All of the characters are clearly defined in the personalities of who is good and who is evil throughout the film. Although this is a long movie, it is an excellent movie to watch. The dialog and camera angles add a great deal to enhancing the roles of the characters. This movie can be compared to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, although Harry and Ron are fighting good and evil straight forward, Paul fights with it internally."

","Yes, you read it, do WALK THE GREEN MILE (not literally though). The Green mile offers much more than what a prison movie should. It is what you say a complete movie with drama, emotions, acting and brilliant direction. Get this, acting from the mentally unstable guy (the rehearsal guy) too is good; so think about the main characters Hanks and Duncan. You will love this movie, no matter what our genre is. A note about the direction - Brilliant! Frank Darabonk has, for me, exceeded his work from the Shawshank Redemption! And Stephen King, his novels are always highly rated and when such a director picks up Stephan's work, masterpieces like The Green Mile and Shawshank are the outcomes.

"Leofwine_draca","9","0","1","24 July 2016"," Supernatural prison drama is a feather in the cap for all involved
","An excellent prison epic which proves to be another splendid adaptation of a Stephen King novel – the bar has certainly been raised in the '90s for such adaptations after all the trash we got in the 1980s (MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE anybody? Thought not). THE GREEN MILE is a splendid exploration of man's psychology, interactions with other men, and attitudes towards life and death emphasised by the uncomfortable Death Row setting. The characters in this film are vividly portrayed by many accomplished actors and actresses and the film works best as a slow-burning character drama packed with incident and occasionally fireworks. Of course being a King story there is a supernatural aspect to the tale (a prisoner is able to perform miracles) but this does not detract from the realism that the film offers in its story.<br/><br/>The narrative is excellent, the film a visual triumph, the special effects work limited and therefore effective. Tom Hanks is great as Paul Edgecomb, the sweaty guard who comes to believe that one of his captives is an angel sent from heaven, but best of all is big Michael Clarke Duncan in an emotional performance that will have any decent viewer reaching for the handkerchiefs during the course of the movie. Also welcome are excellent supporting turns from David Morse, Michael Jeter, and Barry Pepper as fellow prison guards, James Cromwell as the sympathetic Warden and Harry Dean Stanton being weird as always. But the characters who really stick in the mind are the villains: Sam Rockwell as the sleazy, psychopathic inmate who causes no end of grief, and particularly Doug Hutchison as perverted guard Percy. Hutchison, most familiar from his encore performance as mutant killer Tooms in two X-FILES performances back when the show was good, is fantastic in his part and really loathsome – evil, mean and treacherous, but also cowardly, childish and unthinking - a wondrous turn.<br/><br/>The film runs the gamut of emotions from A to Z. Love, fear, wonder, anger, everything in the human condition is explored here at one point or another. There are also a number of shockingly violent moments more powerful than any horror film – this is truly a prison movie for modern times. The worst scene has a prisoner frying on the electric chair but not dying. Ten minutes later he finally dies having emptied the building. A truly gruesome and disturbing moment. THE GREEN MILE is suspenseful, exciting, moving, and often profound – not to mention tear-jerking at key points. Thus it gets two thumbs up from this viewer. Watch out for Mr Jingles, the cutest and cleverest mouse ever seen in a movie (forget MOUSE HUNT for sure)."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","0","2","30 June 2016"," Compelling and provides entertainment throughout; one of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one which really got to me internally, I'd recommend you to watch this.
","'The Green Mile' once again reunites Frank Darabont with Stephen King, after the excellent 'The Shawshank Redemption' first brought their respective geniuses together. It's centered around a small cast of unique characters, a mostly singular location and an emotionally moving story; it's themes of injustice, inevitability, benevolence and miracles raise it above the typical 'prison film' fare - making it something that's actually rather poignant. It's different to what I expected it to be, telling a small-scale story with some unexpected supernatural elements, and is pretty emotionally powerful throughout. It is actually fairly compassionate, with the prison guards being portrayed as kind and gentle for the most part. There isn't an emphasis on brutality or malevolence, and each of the inmates is made to be sympathetic. It is often compared to 'The Shawshank Redemption', for it's setting and key crew - as well as a very similar score by Thomas Newman. While I do prefer 'Shawshank' - a film which is on the top end of my ten favourite films of all time - I certainly appreciate this as well, and honestly feel that it is a very different experience.<br/><br/>The script is excellent, proving that Darabont knows how to write. I'm not sure how much of the dialogue is lifted directly from the novel, but the film creates a plethora of rounded and relatable characters that hold the film together. It's as much a character study as it is a larger story, but both elements are handled spectacularly. Each character feels like a real person, with motivations and desires as well as specific personalities; every decision they make fits them perfectly, and there are no sudden changes of heart just for the sake of the film. The characters are brought to life with amazing performances from every cast member - especially Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse and Michael Jeter. Special mention needs to be made for Sam Rockwell, who stars in a fairly major role that isn't mentioned much. It further solidifies him as an excellent actor, and he is giving 100% to this role; he is incredibly ferocious, energetic and downright despicable. His character, along with Doug Hutchinson's sadistic prison guard, is perhaps the closest thing the film has to a villain - which may be it's most conventional aspect. All of the characters are compelling and given just the right amount of screen-time. The general story is, as I mentioned, small in scale and most of the film is confined to a single prison 'block'. This actually helps the picture greatly, as it allows it to focus on the people and events that are important to the narrative.<br/><br/>The film is a very long one, clocking in at just over three hours, but it kept my attention throughout; I can honestly say that the time flew by, and that the film didn't feel over-long at all. I can't think of a single scene that should have been cut. Perhaps there are a couple that could have, but every scene serves a purpose - whether to advance the plot, develop the characters or even just to provide a little humour. Speaking of which, the picture does feature some light-hearted and funny elements sprinkled throughout. I actually thought that it's tone worked perfectly, and the humour never felt cringe-inducing or out of place; it fit into the story really well, helping to balance out some of the emotionally heavier scenes. The movie does have it's fare share of those too. Scenes featuring Michael Clark Duncan's character in particular were very moving, and his performance is very strong. He has a few short monologues that solidify the themes of the film without shoving them down your throat, which are thought-provoking and wistful. An ending piece of narration also feels remarkably poignant and really makes you think. The film does a very good job of balancing the heavy with the light, effortlessly playing with several emotions at once, so much so that one scene had me practically hiding behind my hands - because the events within it were horrific for a certain sympathetic character - and then another shortly after had me smiling at the connection between a man and a mouse. It not only makes you sad but also happy, a rare combination; it's touching, somber, funny, heartbreaking and entertaining. <br/><br/>Overall, 'The Green Mile' is an excellent movie with an impactful story, compassionate outlook and believable characters; it is incredibly well directed, acted and written. Not only is it compelling and provides entertainment throughout it's long run-time, it's emotionally stirring and generally moving. One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one which really got to me internally, I'd recommend that everyone take the time to watch this: 8/10"
"chadlund","9","0","2","16 June 2016"," Best Stephen King adaptation, Hanks delivers as usual.
","Only reason I did not awarded a 10, is simply because the beginning of the movie wasn't very interesting and didn't seem very necessary to introduce the viewer to the story. In the book, there are two narrators, and the golden rule is when you rewrite a great book, it' s only going to appear inferior.<br/><br/>But the cinematography is very good, the actors do their part, even though it is clear Hanks outplays the rest of the cast, the scenes are pretty shocking but strikingly well done. Maybe people might not like how prison centers are portrayed, especially the lack of excessive violence used on jailbirds. <br/><br/>Why I thought was also a negative was the repentance of the death rowers - really, these criminals cannot be changed, no brain surgery can change them - I just on't buy the repentance, it's very sentimental.<br/><br/>But overall, everyone should see this movie, you have to understand the book was published in six volumes, it cannot be reduced into an hour and a half."

","This is one of those movies that if you haven't seen by now (in 2016), shame on you. Really. Please do not call yourself a movie buff or fan if you have not seen this title. The DVD is now in Walmart at 5 bucks and even 3 bucks (I have bought 2 copies at those prices)<br/><br/>Im not going to waste time in explaining what this movie is about because words can't make it justice. It's such a shame that a movie this good has come and gone and is still a very powerful story with actors that PERFECTLY translated it to film. Other than the obvious fact that the movie follow the book incredibly, almost unfathomably, but also that the message gets across, while only leaving scraps of details from the books that it is derived from. Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan etch out an amazing team performance that is rarely seen between 2 actors of their respective stature. It is sad that every time I see this movie, which is quite a lot yearly, I am reminded that Michael Clarke Duncan has passed away, as well as Michael Jeter. 2 actors that should've been in more movies like this. Incredibly powerful performances. Sam Rockwell, David Morse, Jeffrey DeMunn, James Cromwell, Barry Pepper and Bonnie Hunt are not devoid of any praises. All of them brought their A game to this movie and all of their characters are memorable, considering it is a movie that shares the screen with so many wonderful actors. Even Gary Sinise and William Sadler in their short camera times, steal the show with careful conviction to their roles. There's nothing you can say about The Green Mile that hasn't been said already. It is a beautiful, compelling and masterful tearjerker that will leave you breathless. The only questions that you may leave with, and trust me, there are not that many, you can find in the books. I suggest you pick those up and give them a read. This movie is so great, that when I read the books back in 99, I pictured the actors on it while reading the books and I was not disappointed. The Green Mile, much like the Shawshank Redemption are movies that will always stand the test of time because the time in the movie is not really set. The power behind the stories shift around eras and they can fit any time frame you might be standing in. That is still the case for me in 2016. I still watch this movie on DVD and still get moved to tears. It is simply a masterpiece that cannot fade away, no matter how hard you come up with other choices in movies."

It would be interesting to do historical research for the explanation. 2) the gentle, kind atmosphere of the « mile » : except the needed bad guys, everybody else looks as peaceful as the ones of the retirement home : the inmates for death row are supposed to be the worst criminals, while there they are rather lost souls : in a way, it's almost like we should cry for them !

Directed and written by Frank Darabont, based on a Stephen King novel, it features Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan in the lead roles.<br/><br/>This film is proof that, even in Hollywood, film art still finds a room. In fact, it's one of the most beautiful and human films made by the industry in recent decades and deals with controversial issues such as the impartiality of the justice and prison system, questionableness of capital punishment and the human right to a truly fair trial. The script is above reproach and it truly lives up to King's book. The cast surpassed in quality, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan, an actor who still isn't very famous outside the U.S. but that made a deep and moving role. Tom Hanks was also good but it wasn't unexpected because he had shone in recent films like ""Philadelphia"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"", launched one or two years before this.<br/><br/>Address controversial issues in an original and impactive way is often synonymous with success in cinema.

Clarke gave his all in this show and it was his one real chance to win an award. But the PC crowd who voted nixed any chance because this show actually had a spiritual side to it. With Caine, the PC'ers could promote abortion, and that was their logic. As for the show, I gave it 9 stars, because I felt too many people would never be able to see it with the R rated language.

He also possesses a unique healing power. Hanks is happily married but has a urinary problem, which is healed by Duncan, much to his surprise. It becomes somewhat unfocused and disjointed with unexplained situations such as why this guy can heal. Directed by Frank Darabont who previously made The Shawshank Redemption. He is backed by excellent visual elements that highlight the time period. Hanks stands firm as he observes this unique being and struggles to find his innocence, but the conclusion is too depressing. Morse does well as a guard who is the right hand man and witness to everything. Duncan is overwhelming as the large yet fragile prisoner. We are given no explanations other than the reality of watching him ultimately suffer. Doug Hutchinson steals scenes as a small yet sadistic guard who elevates his power beyond reason. Michael Jeter plays an inmate who has a pet mouse and this becomes a controversial scene with Hutchinson. The executions are severe and difficult to watch.

"brianberta","6","0","1","29 January 2016"," An emotionally powerful experience
","While The Shawshank Redemption is widely called the best jail/prison movie ever made, The Green Mile is often compared to it and the 2 films can easily be seen as rivals. What's interesting is that both films were directed by the same person, Frank Darabont. However, there is something major which sets both of them apart. The Shawshank Redemption was mainly from the prisoners perspective. The Green Mile, on the other hand, is mainly focused on the prison guards perspective. I was very interested in seeing this movie because I was curious of what he was going to do with it. I was not disappointed when I saw it and I'm glad that I did.<br/><br/>After an African American man is sent on death row after supposedly killing 2 young girls, the prisoners and prison guards are shocked when they realize that he has a miraculous gift. They soon start to think that he probably didn't commit the crime and he may be killed for something he didn't do.<br/><br/>The best thing about The Green Mile is that it is an emotionally absorbing experience with well-developed characters that I cared for deeply. The movie lets us know that just because the prisoners did something bad once in their lives, they still have a charming and kinder side to them and they might not be as bad as most would expect a death row inmate to be. The movie uses this to make you care for the characters. And you know what, it does a great job at it. Scenes when they die are very sad because of the kinder side the gives to them. I have to give this movie credit for making me grow a connection to death row inmates.<br/><br/>There are also characters that you really hate and want to see killed instead of ones you like. There is Wild Bill, a crazy and immature prisoner who acts rude to everyone. The movie did a great job making me hate his character. However, the character that I hated the most was Percy Wetmore. He treats all of the prisoners poorly and shows no respect to any of them. He is even hated by all of the prison guards. There were a few sadistic things he did which I felt were slightly exaggerated and over-the-top, but that's not to say that those actions didn't cause me to develop any sort of vendetta or hatred towards him. All in all, the movie does a great job with most of the main characters. There were some characters which I had a strong emotional attachment to, and there were other ones which I had a bitter hatred for.<br/><br/>Another thing I really loved about the movie was its fantasy aspect. It made the movie very interesting and it made the ending kind of thought provoking. I can understand why someone might find it to be jarring, but I didn't find it to be that at all. I think that it fit just fine in the movie and it is one of the things which made John Coffey such a great character. It immediately made me become drawn to him and the film becomes much more interesting once he gets introduced. Also, the ending is thought provoking because it makes the viewer speculate why Paul is living so long. It begs the question whether Paul's gift of living longer is actually a gift or a punishment. It also makes me wonder how long he will live.<br/><br/>In mine and many other people's opinions, John Coffey's death is the saddest movie death scene of all time. It was not only fleshed out very well, but it was also proved that John Coffey was innocent. This isn't the first film to have a wrongly convicted convict, but it is definitely the film which fleshed it out the most and made the nature of it hit the hardest. Also, the scene when he dies is very sad since it has numerous things in it which can make the viewer feel sad. It could be his last words, it could be the fact that Paul was hesitant to give the final order, it could be the part when he shakes his hand goodbye, or several other things which happen in it.<br/><br/>Despite everything I said so far, the movie is not perfect. The issues in it mainly rely on its pacing and length. Its pacing flaws are most noticeable in the first act as it takes way too long for John's gift to be introduced as the movie deals with numerous sub-plots first and it takes way too long to introduce us to all of the characters. The movie introduces us as to how Percy loses his temper easily by having him break someone's fingers, it shows us a flashback of John being caught, it introduces us to the Warden and his wife, it shows the guards find a mouse and let Del keep it as a pet, it shows another execution, and many other scenes. Also, I felt like it sometimes took a long time for the movie to move along near the middle of it and some parts of it seemed bland. The pacing and length needed work, but that's my only major complaint with the film.<br/><br/>Despite the pacing and length, The Green Mile was well worth my time. It was an emotionally absorbing experience with well-developed characters that I cared for greatly. This is the kind of a movie where you keep on rooting for a happy ending even though you know that it's probably going to have a tragic one. I also really liked the fantasy aspect to it, and it made the movie very interesting and the ending somewhat thought provoking and even more poignant. It's not going to be replacing The Shawshank Redemption anytime soon, but I still recommend it and I think that it is worth your time."

Sadly for me, no matter how hard I tried I simply couldn't be fully immersed in it.<br/><br/>It doesn't have that much things going for it from the start. 3 hours is a long time and with this movie it feels like half an hour or more could've been cut, specially since the main conflict doesn't really start until almost an hour into the movie. Is at that moment that you'll either get completely sucked in or totally taken out of the film.<br/><br/>The score by Thomas Newman isn't always on point and its not helped by the fact that movie is all over the place during two thirds of its runtime. Goes from almost a feel good movie, to pretty much a tragedy. The cinematography isn't that inspired and the editing may be a little to slow for some.<br/><br/>Both Tom Hanks and the late Michael Clarke Duncan give knockout performances and are perfectly casted. Problem is, they're pretty much the only fleshed out characters in the movie. You cant really feel how it affects the people around them and that makes some of the performances during one of the final scenes difficult to buy. Its a story only about the two of them but the movie frequently tries to also make it about the world around them and end ups failing at both. That doesn't hurt the finale that much, which absolutely nails the message of the film and will keep you thinking about it for a while.<br/><br/>Its predictable and the obvious religious theme may not be for everyone, but its still a very enjoyable movie."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","2","13 June 2015"," One Of Modern Cinema's Finest Tearjerkers.
","From the director of The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile is yet another poignant, touching & thoroughly gratifying prison drama that's patiently crafted, skilfully narrated & brilliantly performed and even though it's no match to Frank Darabont's 1994 masterpiece, it does carry an emotional weight that makes it one of cinema's finest tearjerkers.<br/><br/>Based on Stephen King's novel of the same name, the story of The Green Mile is set during the 1930s and concerns a prison officer in charge of death row inmates at a penitentiary. The plot covers his & others guards lives' which is greatly affected when they find out that their newly arrived prisoner, a giant African-American man, is gifted with supernatural powers.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Frank Darabont, the film marks yet another adaptation of a Stephen King's novel by the filmmaker and once again, he has transformed it beautifully on the silver screen. The screenplay also deserves a mention for it takes care of the smallest of details & always keeps the focus on its characters. Plus, there is ample amount of character depth to be found here.<br/><br/>Cinematography makes excellent use of its camera in capturing the usually repetitive, dull & still life of prison and the warm colour tones are precisely executed. The passage of time in the prison is strongly felt in the film's own 188 minutes of runtime but it never becomes an chore for the drama is too absorbing & rich in content. Thomas Newman once again chips in with an evocative score and it only gets better as the film nears its finale.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, The Green Mile features a reliable cast in Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell & others, and their contributions lift the drama up by a great extent. Hanks is once again at his usual best but it's Duncan who steals the show with a truly heartbreaking performance and the scenes between him & Hanks are a treat to watch. Morse is good, Hutchiston nicely sells his sadist character & Rockwell does fine in his cameo.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Green Mile is a wonderfully balanced motion picture that somehow manages to make its long runtime work in its favour. Sure it gets overly sentimental at times but none of those moments appear as a desperate attempt to move the viewers but genuine progression of the story. Also, the seamless blend between its supernatural elements & realistic setting allows the viewers to accept the story as it is without question and the film as a whole remains a gripping, heart-rending & emotionally shattering fable that's definitely worth your time & money."
"alecwest","9","0","1","12 June 2015"," Just one problem.
","Almost all of Stephen King's novels end badly for one or more of the protagonists. For example, in ""Cujo,"" the boy dies. However, Hollywood has a problem with kids dying horribly and re-did the ending of the movie version, allowing the boy to make a miraculous recovery.<br/><br/>This movie remained true to the novel in that the protagonist (John Coffey) dies. Perhaps King insisted that the movie remain true to the novel because King is anti-death-penalty - and wanted the novel & movie to make a ""statement"" in that regard - that some innocent people get executed.<br/><br/>In any event, when Coffey was explaining to Paul ""why"" he wanted to die, he said, ""It's the way things are all over the world.""<br/><br/>(possible spoiler warning) Knowing what they knew, Paul, Brutal & Harry could have provided Coffey with a far better outcome. First, and this wouldn't take much convincing, they'd need to convince Coffey that it wasn't the way things were ""all"" over the world - that there were places where he could find peace and contentment. Then, all they'd have to do is sign a statement to the effect that they witnessed Wild Bill's deathbed confession ... admitting he'd committed the crime John Coffey was accused of. A deathbed confession witnessed by three people of good reputation is almost never disregarded by a court of law. With that signed statement given to the prosecutor & Coffey's public defender, a new trial would have been a given ... if it even needed to come to trial.<br/><br/>Afterward, Paul could have found a job for John doing manual labor (for room/board only) in, for example, a Buddhist monastery - a place where John would be surrounded with peace and contentment for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>I can see only one possible negative ... involving the farmer and his wife. Knowing that it was Wild Bill who did the deed, they'd both realize they'd ""hired"" the man who killed their daughters - and it might put a strain on their marriage that couldn't be overcome. But, heck, the truth would set them free.<br/><br/>So, I give the movie an overall 9 rating ... taking away 1 point for John Coffey's needless death."

","Unusual but charming blend of crime, drama and fantasy based on the 1996 Stephen King novel of the same name, which follows death row corrections officer Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) during the Great Depression in the United States, and the supernatural events he and his fellow guards witness by gentle and simple-minded prisoner John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), who is accused of child murder and rape. With many charming characters and fun subplots, this epic outing is enjoyable from start to finish. Dabbs Greer's final film, whose character—an elderly Edgecomb—tells the story in a flashback format. A very touching masterpiece.<br/><br/>***½ (out of four)"

","I watched the movie after I read the book and I was so, so happy to see that they wasn't messed up him. I think this is the greatest movie , which is based on a book by Stephen King, because everything: the actors, the story, the acting of everybody, who are involved in the movie is just perfect. When the movie finished I was like: Damn, Hanks and Duncan are so good. It's really difficult to make someone cry only by movie, but the whole idea of the movie - the big ""bad"" men , who is so emotional and who try to give everything from him to save two girls, and his live after that is so, so complicated. As a big fan of Stephen King , I can say that ""The Green Mile"" is one of my favorite books ever. In it (and in the movie of course) the reader can find everything: good and evil, love and pain, the significance and insignificance of life and so many, many things. After you watch the movie you have 10-15 minutes just to think . Not much movies can do this with me."

","First time I heard about this, I thought ""This will probably be bad."" Then I watched it and holy molly! I loved everything!

I cried at the end when the big dude was going too die and I cried the most when Del went on fire.<br/><br/>I watched this like... two times and I still love it even now. Once I saw the flash back from the prisoner (I forgot his name...) I was like ""NO YOU DIDN'T!"" I were so happy when Percy shot him with 5 bullets. I'd love watch more of these movies with stories that is based on a true story or not a true story. Like this is a movie we need our world. Even I do love horror movies then these...

","After knowing about the Stephen King's novel, I was little afraid how can a visual adaptation match with its narration and emotion. But I was literally moved when I saw this near-perfect adaptation by Frank Darabont. I experienced more than what it did when I saw Shawshank Redemption. <br/><br/>Easily the best experience I ever had while watching a movie so lengthy. <br/><br/>The screenplay is the main plus which makes us engage in this fantasy tale which looks realistic on screen. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks in his tailor made role just lifts the environment with his acting and it was supported well by the rest but to me it was Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore! This performance will surely last long. Main highlight for the movie.<br/><br/>Nothing more to say just go and enjoy thats all! Don't ever think of missing this wonderful movie."

","There are certain works that are in our minds through the years. ""The Green Mile"" may not be considered a classic unwavering and unquestionable, but it is certainly one of those films latest movies that are not forgotten by those who see. Today there long after its release can not fail to mention this book when asked about an exceptional film that indicate, or can not get our head its strong scenes and exciting.<br/><br/>Originally published in six parts, with the title of ""The Green Mile"", the novel was released in a single volume: The Green Mile. And director Frank Darabont does seem to have a mission to wow the audience and can again. Darabont - who had previously adapted another classic Stephen King, the spectacular The Shawshank Redemption (1994) - writes and directs this new adaptation full of mystery and drama, which also takes place in a prison in the middle of Great Depression. In the book, the film is set in 1932, and the film was the last time for 1935 for the movie Top Hat (1935) directed by Mark Sandrich and starring Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, could be included in one of the leading and most exciting scenes of the movie.<br/><br/>The great merit of Frank Darabont was making a movie of just over three hours seemed to have much less, and not to have uninterrupted action scenes, but by arresting our attention with several parallel stories and emotion, even taking it slow, which take place in a virtual scenario, with few exterior scenes. The story of the film is not easy, talking about prison, murder and all the tension of a plot that talks about death row. The director has the ability to show all the characters and making us have a direct relationship with them, which further enhances the drama. Inside the prison we are introduced to Arlen Bitterbuck (Graham Greene), even appearing little question that if a man's heart really regret what he did, if he could be forgiven. See also Eduard ""Del"" Delacroix (Michael Jeter) and his friendship with the mouse Mr. Jingles. Exciting is the scene where he's going to death row and the boss says Gross Edgecomb and they were good men and would have met them before. The crime of Del's never spoken to his relationship with the audience to escalate. Sam Rockwell plays brilliantly 'Wild Bill' Wharton knew and spend a little of their coldness and insanity accurately.<br/><br/>On the side of the guards and prison officials who related to these prisoners, we have, besides Paul, Brutus 'Brutal' Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey DeMunn), Toot-Toot (Harry Dean Stanton), Warden ""Hal"" Moores (James Cromwell) and obnoxious, sadistic Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison). The cast is still completed with the lovely Jan Edgecomb (Bonnie Hunt) and Melinda Moores (Patricia Clarkson).<br/><br/>Frank Darabont defines the characters in his first scene as good or evil, giving them a certain one-sidedness. Even having seen the impressive John Coffey, to realize his look of fear and weakness, we know that there is something special, and that he could not have committed the crime of which he was accused. The viewer knows that ""Wild Bill"" is a dangerous criminal because it simulates an apparent catatonia to then attack the guards, so arrives in prison. You also realize how obnoxious and arrogant guard Percy (nephew of the wife of the state governor) is to yell ""More a dead man"" when John is escorted into the Green Mile. Their attitudes below only wildly increase the antipathy we have every scene in which he appears. Especially when we know that what he really wants is a close witness an execution. Great job Doug Hutchison, who unfortunately was not nominated for any awards.<br/><br/>This attribution of good and evil to the characters is crucial so that we can import more or less certain character. This is perhaps one of the points that weaken slightly the film, where the director says clearly who deserves to die or not. So we can sympathize with those who have decided their fate, and feel it was a deserved fate who proved wrong. The problem lies right there: no one is completely good or completely evil. Another factor to be raised is the final penalty of ""near immortality"" that reiterates God ""evil"" and vengeful Old Testament. Even having done well all the time, for killing His Envoy, he deserves punishment.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks once again proves that it is an exceptional actor, showing kindness and goodness central to his relationship with Coffey worked. Sam Rockwell, Doug Hutchison, Michael Jeter, James Cromwell are also in the correct tone on the scene. But is Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, that makes the film work. His character was the main ingredient to pass the credibility, gentleness, kindness and fear needed to represent the great miracle of God appeared that Green Mile death. His interpretation was key to building the relationship with the Tom Hanks character and to show the differences between the character of the giant with the softly, arrogant, nasty Percy. Duncan was deservedly nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe 2000 for this majestic work.<br/><br/>Still in the cast, we can not fail to mention the remarkable soundtrack by Thomas Newman (The Shawshank Redemption (1994), The Horse Whisperer (1998), Finding Nemo (2003). Composer knows dosing chords softer and powerful theme song masterfully.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont film develops slowly. The first time he introduces the characters to the public, the second time develops the gift of John Coffey and conquer the audience, and at the last minute presents shocking and memorable end. The film is basically about solidarity, redemption, justice, pain, fear and life. A sensitive film, captivating, painful and above all, unique. Frank Darabont has achieved a great classic drama."
"barryrd","Null","0","1","14 March 2015"," Epic Story of Prison Life
","The Green Mile is a great movie, almost epic in length but it never drags. This story of prison life consists of a series of episodes and scenes that are woven together to tell the experience of one man who spent a number of years working with inmates on death row and another man of great physical presence whose heart was larger than life. Some of the most depraved behaviour comes from one of the guards, who is bent on inflicting as much suffering and humiliation as he can get away with. I would point out that it is a movie that deals with the supernatural, so realism is not a factor in assessing the movie. However, we do see human nature at its best and worst. The best examples shine because of the extreme depravity and sadism that we experience. It is not a movie for the faint of heart; it is based on a Stephen King novel. King is not known for shying away from graphic descriptions of violence or what others might describe as ""being in bad taste"". So this movie brings those literary images to the screen. On the other hand, we also witness supernatural scenes but they are not treated as a normal part of the action, as in many modern ""thrillers"". I was tremendously impressed by Tom Hanks' performance but all the cast made a great contribution to the show. It is certainly a great movie, albeit with a confused ending. Despite that, I would gladly view it again."

","""We think of this place like an intensive care ward of a hospital."" So says Paul Edgecomb, who is in charge of Death Row in a Louisiana penitentiary during the Depression. Paul (Tom Hanks) is a nice man, probably nicer than your average Louisiana Death Row guard, and his staff is competent and humane--all except for the loathsome Percy, whose aunt is married to the governor, and who could have any state job he wants, but likes it here because ""he wants to see one cook up close."" One day a new prisoner arrives. He is a gigantic black man, framed by the low-angle camera to loom over the guards and duck under doorways. This is John Coffey (""like the drink, only not spelled the same""), and he has been convicted of molesting and killing two little white girls. From the start it is clear he is not what he seems. He is afraid of the dark, for one thing. He is straightforward in shaking Paul's hand--not like a man with anything to be ashamed of.<br/><br/>This is not a good summer for Paul. He is suffering from a painful infection and suffering, too, because Percy (Doug Hutchison) is like an infection in the ward: ""The man is mean, careless and stupid-- that's a bad combination in a place like this."" Paul sees his duty as regulating a calm and decent atmosphere in which men prepare to die.<br/><br/>""The Green Mile"" (so-called because this Death Row has a green floor) is based on a novel by Stephen King, and has been written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is Darabont's first film since the great ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in 1994. That, too, was based on a King prison story, but this one is very different. It involves the supernatural, for one thing--in a spiritual, not creepy, way.<br/><br/>Both movies center on relationships between a white man and a black man. In ""Shawshank"" the black man was the witness to a white man's dogged determination, and here the black man's function is to absorb the pain of whites--to redeem and forgive them. By the end, when he is asked to forgive them for sending him to the electric chair, the story has so well prepared us that the key scenes play like drama, not metaphor, and that is not an easy thing to achieve.<br/><br/>The movie is told in flashback as the memories of Paul as an old man, now in a retirement home. ""The math doesn't quite work out,"" he admits at one point, and we find out why. The story is in no haste to get to the sensational and supernatural; it takes at least an hour simply to create the relationships in the prison, where Paul's lieutenant (David Morse) is rock-solid and dependable, where the warden (James Cromwell) is good and fair, and where the prisoners include a balmy coot named Delacroix (Michael Jeter) and a taunting monster named Wharton (Sam Rockwell).<br/><br/>Looming over all is the presence of John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a man whose own lawyer says he seems to have ""dropped out of the sky."" Coffey cannot read or write, seems simpleminded, causes no trouble and exudes goodness. The reason Paul consults the lawyer is because he comes to doubt this prisoner could have killed the little girls. Yet Coffey was found with their broken bodies in his huge arms. And in Louisiana in the 1930s, a black man with such evidence against him is not likely to be acquitted by a jury. (We might indeed question whether a Louisiana Death Row in the 1930s would be so fair and hospitable to a convicted child molester, but the story carries its own conviction, and we go along with it.) There are several sequences of powerful emotion in the film. Some of them involve the grisly details of the death chamber, and the process by which the state makes sure that a condemned man will actually die (Harry Dean Stanton has an amusing cameo as a stand-in at a dress rehearsal with the electric chair). One execution is particularly gruesome and seen in some detail; the R rating is earned here, despite the film's generally benevolent tone. Other moments of great impact involve a tame mouse which Delacroix adopts, a violent struggle with Wharton (and his obscene attempts at rabble- rousing), and subplots involving the wives of Paul (Bonnie Hunt) and the warden (Patricia Clarkson)."
"msvalkyrie","9","0","1","1 March 2015"," A brilliant movie, worth the length
","This film really touched me. Seriously, it's emotional. I was expecting it to be a realistic drama about a nice guy being condemned to death. But then the fantasy part comes in and it's quite surprising.<br/><br/>But this film really is just pure art. It's original. It's touching. It's an extraordinary tale. And the actors are brilliant. Each actor plays their part brilliantly. From Tom Hanks playing the nice and kind prison guard with the bladder problem to Percy, who's um... not a very nice guy apparently.<br/><br/>The film is three hours long but those three hours are worth it. Unlike the tedious Titanic film, each minute of this film is interesting and keeps you gripped throughout the entire thing. It gives you a mixture of emotions: Joy, laughter and also grief. And of course, hate for Percy. Michael Clarke Duncan is usually seen playing big brutal thugs because of his huge height and muscle, actually he's surprisingly great at playing the soft John Coffey.<br/><br/>The plot is actually very simple. I'm not going to give away too much but you definitely know that this movie is not what it seems. But it's really the acting that brings out the film. The acting really is impressive, mainly drives the film to be honest. It didn't even need a plot, shove these guys into one room and tell them to act out a few lines and BOOM, it would still be a decent film. So when it comes to cast, The Green Mile really does have it good.<br/><br/>It's actually quite hard to find any bad points about this film. The length was one thing, maybe it could have been shorter. But other than that it was brilliant. <br/><br/>The film is very interesting. You see the point of view of prisoners who are on death row and realize that maybe there is actually a reason why it was banned in some countries. Because you start to feel how they feel when they are left with something like this. Only weeks to live. Some of the prisoners you are glad they are in this state, but the other prisoners you just feel sorry for. The film brings out one vital message: Should they really still be punished even if they are truly sorry for what they did wrong? It sounds stupid while you're reading this but watch the film and you will understand what I'm saying. Trust me. This film might just change your view on the death penalty. <br/><br/>It really is a great film and it's quite hard to find flaws in any of it. You care for most of the characters, even Mister Jingles the small little mouse who turns out to be a nuisance at first but even for a mouse he's a lovable character... Apart from Percy, no, Percy can go to hell. <br/><br/>It is one of the most dramatic films ever and I was nearly crying at the end. A realistic but sad ending. The plot line is simple but unique. Trust me, it sounds boring. It's set in 1930s and is based around death row (yawn), but it's actually really interesting and it gripped me right from the start. The story is more than what it seems and actually turns out to be quite deep.<br/><br/>So that's enough said because I really have nothing else to say. It's an amazing movie and really is worth a watch."

","it was a beautiful film. We saw how good it was like to be there in time in such a prison. Here they brought people to life by an electric chair which is very painful. The story is very well organized that a man is innocent because I believe that his punishment will serve namely that seat. But who gives a special gift. So he gives created a mouse alive again in the story and he gives a woman made more healthy. The story itself is very moving especially the man who is actually a good man, and man just wants to help. The reason he was there was that he allegedly killed a girl but he wanted to help her just because the person who killed her actually came in the end also end up in prison and that the man could see it. he was so afraid of the man and the circumstances together were very moving.

","I just watched this movie for the third or fourth time and I still enjoyed it like it was my first time. From all the Stephen King books this must be the best film made out of them all, along with The Shining. The actors are all fabulous especially Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan. I rarely cry with a movie but every time John Coffey gets me that far at the end. What an emotional movie this is with all the injustice. For a movie that is longer then three hours I was never bored for one second. And that is rare for me because normally after maximum two hours I start checking my watch. But with this one I never have that problem, that's how I am completely absorbed by the story and the characters. It's definitely one of my all time favorite movies."
"bridle15","9","0","1","18 February 2015"," A very touching film
","John Coffey is a kind, loving and peaceful man who only wants happiness and for everyone to get along. Sadly the film is set in America during the great depression (1930s) so racism is part of everyday life and so characters are blinded by this factor and so judge a book by its cover, Coffey is that misunderstood individual (until the end that is).<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is top notch and it has been almost perfectly adapted from the great novel by Stephen King, along with fantastic casting and most importantly the key emotional aspect is present throughout the film too.<br/><br/>When reading the book I hated the character of Percy with a passion and was so happy with his downfall, but in the movie I despised him even more this was due to the realistic evil glimmer in his eye when he crushed Mr Jingles or whacked Delacroix with his baton and his sarcastic nature that he used time and time again made me want to punch him repeatedly in the face as did many of his co workers. So well done to Dutch Hutchinson for really bringing this b*****d of a character to life! <br/><br/>The film reminds us that we all have our own Green mile we must walk when we reach the end of our lives but we do not know when or how, we must enjoy the time we have and get to know people for who they are and not what they seem to be.<br/><br/>Overall this film is very saddening and will surely make you feel many different emotions at once in a matter of 3 hours, that you will never forget.

"shockwave6464","9","0","1","31 October 2014"," Cinematic Perfection
","This film has done everything well. From the script to the on-screen performances to the film editing. Michael Clarke Duncan portrays the role of his lifetime and one of the best performances of the 90s in this film as the gentle giant John Coffey who is a miracle worker. Other noticeable performances in this film are Tom Hanks as prison guard Paul Edgecomb who witnesses Coffey's miracles and Sam Rockwell as the reckless William ""Wild Bill"" Wharton who has complete disregard for human life. In films like this, you can really hate the antagonists and sympathize with the protagonists. The score of this film done by Thomas Newman is very suitable for a film with such dark atmosphere and it also stands out on it's own. This film can also be a tearjerker when it chooses to be. This easily deserves to be placed in any ""Top 10"" list in the film industry."

","An abundantly loyal Stephen King adaptation (something of a rarity) that manages to balance a ton of heart and an equal amount of weirdness without getting the two hopelessly tangled along the way. It can be blunt and telegraphed at times, it's seriously overlong at just past three hours, and the dialog has moments of real weakness, but it's able to counter all that with a serious knack for tension, a truckload of bittersweet feelings and some fantastic central performances. Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan are the most visible, and work an easy connection with the cameras in two deeply sympathetic roles, but Sam Rockwell also hands in a terrific part as a give-no-damns lunatic whose wild, vicious, unhinged attitude works in strong contrast to his cellmates' general resignation. Tough to watch in places, especially as the mile's population begins to dwindle, but generally arresting and intensely emotional - there isn't anything else quite like it."

","When I first heard of the title for this film, I thought it would be a really bad war story or something close. But how mind blown was I really? I had to take confirmation from a 46 year old man to tell me how good the film really was. It was difficult to agree. As soon as the screen came on and the film began to play, I was instantly sucked in. The whole story of how the two men are connected in some way gave me the shivers- in a good way. All of the struggles that they prisoners and officers together show that not all people are evil and may be accused for the wrong crimes. I wont be a spoiler to whoever has not seen this film, but all I have to say is that the ending is that emotional, it actually made me cry. All in all, even after watching the amazing film, I still wonder who the prisoner actually was. To me, he was a gift from god."

"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","2","29 July 2014"," ""The Green Mile"" is an underrated work of art about the characteristics of fantasy and reality.
","Frank Darabont five years after the classic ""Shawshanke Redemption"" creates another prison drama that is a balance between the real world and fantasy. With Tom Hanks being the lead, you already know your off to a terrific start. Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb, a warden at a Louisiana prison in the 1930's who stumbles upon a new prisoner, John Coffey, who changes his life forever. Coffey is a huge African-American man who is accused of raping and murdering two young girls. We get to see extremely powerful flashbacks of the victims family searching around their land for their daughters, who eventually find Coffey holding the dead girls while screaming his head off. Michael Clark Duncan plays John Coffey amazingly, and in this scene in particular you will find one of the greatest scenes in acting history from this talented artist. Paul and John end up forming a relationship, causing Paul to find out that John has special healing powers and that he is in fact innocent. The story turns into a portrayal of honesty, trust, and chance. There's so much more conflict going on inside the prison that you won't be lost for a second. We have Percy, a cruel prison guard causing tension around the prison, many other prisoners and executions and a crazy prisoner that brings up a lot of questioning. Frank Darabont has proved to us that he is the master at making prison films. ""The Green Mile"" is a powerful film with tremendous acting and a very original story. I love how we get a great background of every character and every event shaped without spoiling the big mysteries and climaxes the film has. The balance between murder mystery and natural human emotions and motifs from these profound characters builds a perfect bond of mystery and compassion. Two other elements that are calculated well are the separation between fantasy and reality. We get an overwhelmingly natural portrayal of a prison from the 30's and natural characters played perfectly by each actor to give a realistic tone to the film, and yet we get a man who's basically as superhero that works to fight with the struggles of a tough, realistic situation. ""The Green Mile"" is a film that brings up a lot about how to better enjoy life and how experiences from the past can stay with us forever. An absolute terrific film!"

"KaylaMaster","7","0","1","15 June 2014"," Good movie, bad ending....
","Trying not to write a complete spoiler but it's tough, since the ending is what I want to talk about. I'd say, this is a partial spoiler but not completely!<br/><br/>It took a very long time for me to finally watch this movie because I am such a fan of The Shawshank Redemption. I knew there were plenty of similarities both in subject matter, and people connected to both films. <br/><br/>There's no doubt that I was increasingly on the edge of my seat as the movie progressed, but ultimately, I was deeply disappointed in the ending. Here's my reasoning:<br/><br/>John had suffered so much pain and disappointment in humanity. He was living in a time very different from today when blacks were often scapegoats for the crimes of others. (Much like in To Kill a Mockingbird) He wanted and frankly, was in desperate need of someone to save HIM as he had done for countless others. Here was a man who delighted in the smallest things of nature, of art and music and in the good of humanity. No one would have appreciated a kind act more than him, nor did he need it so desperately. Yes, he was a sensitive soul who absorbed the pain of others. But if you've ever heard this from anyone you love and/or respect and believed they were a powerful force for good in the world, would you just take them at their word that they wanted to die? Of course not! He needed Paul to stand up for HIM. To save HIM, and to speak out at the injustice of executing any man for a crime he did not commit. That would have been the heroic thing to do. <br/><br/>This had an expedient Hollywood ending but it doesn't make one feel a sense of triumph the way Shawshank did. Truth and justice did not will out. I know, I know, that's the way it is sometimes in the real world but clearly the movie was made to make a point, to convey important ideas. I much prefer a film that ultimately has an uplifting message that makes all the pain and horror of watching it worthwhile, at least in the movies!"

","The Green Mile is unambiguously invigorating. It is a tale that comprehends the true nature of life exclusive of how it is everyday all over the world. The story exhibits the daily lives of prison guards who are altered after an unexpected inmate makes an entrance to the green mile. <br/><br/>Notwithstanding the fact that it possesses an overlong run time of 180 minutes, it doubtlessly manages to make a hit. The plot may seem to be chimerical, but beyond any question, it is heart-rending. The movie latches on to all the necessary requisites, precisely, a thought-provoking story line, commendable dialogues and a very compassionate conclusion.<br/><br/>The casting department deserves special appreciation for assembling such a splendid movie troupe. Tom Hanks, who played the leading role was gratifying as ever. Michael Clarke Duncan and David Morse played the greater supporting roles. They were undeniably supreme for the roles assigned to them. Supporting them were Barry Pepper, James Cromwell, Doug Hutchison and Sam Rockwell who were stirring as well. Minor roles played by Bonny Hunt and Michael Jeter too were satisfactory. <br/><br/>Frank Darabont definitely aced at the film's direction. The screenplay adapted from Stephen King's novel was exquisite. Yet another time after 'The Shining' and 'The Shawshank Redemption', Stephen King has assured audience satisfaction. Editing and Cinematography departments have pulled off a fair job. Music by Thomas Newman was alluring as well. <br/><br/>Summarizing everything, the movie is simply ravishing, appealing from all the angles. Wish I could come out with the story but then, ""What happens at the mile, stays at the mile."" Rent 3 hours for this one and you will embrace it, without a doubt."

","""The Green Mile"" is a very good movie. I saw it 2 months before and I was exciting. As a crime movie it concentrates to a story of a murder, in which police arrest the wrong person ( not the killer ), but the one who tried to save the victims of the murder with his magic gift from God. It contains many elements of fantasy and it travels you to a magic adventure. Personally, I think it's also an emotional and a drama movie because it shows the pain and the madness of someone who knows that he is going to die hardly because of death penalty. So, I suggest to see it. I've already suggested it to my friends. You will understand the situation at these prisons and I'm pretty sure that you'll like it, If you like this kind of movies."

Man, it was three hours, but I didn't move to another attention while watching it. Yes, it was long, and the settings is just jail, house, and jail again. The character is just the ones that appear in the beginning. No such a great twist, but I feel the flow, the slow flow of characterization that Darabont give to the audience. A very precious sequence that easily come into my mind and still leave trace until now. Strong characterization, a great deal of humanity sense, critics, and drama delivered together by this motion picture.<br/><br/>I don't surprised when ""The Green Mile"" didn't win a single Oscar. In one hand, there are many great movie in that year, from ""Fight Club"", which is brand new and fresh. The modern visual effects and science fiction story from ""The Matrix"". The conclusion of mainstream American drama movie by ""American Beauty"", until a bunch of twist by Shyamalan in ""The Sixth Sense"". In the other hand, ""The Green Mile"" isn't the film to just entertain. It makes you gratitude to your life. It can touch the blind side of heart for some people, to look his very humanity, his compassion and feeling about each other.<br/><br/>I haven't said the technical things yet.

"gaurav_toyo","10","0","1","30 December 2013"," Hanks, Duncan and chills down your spine
","Have you ever felt the feeling of not feeling ashamed for crying unabashedly in public, watching well what, just a movie??? This was the case with me when I went through this motion picture running for a whopping three hours with powerhouse performances from bigshot Tom Hanks and the relatively unknown late Michael Clarke Duncan. This is among a list of American movies rating right up there with the best with a spotless storyline, a screenplay that is just oh-so-brilliant that I had to constantly rewind in order to clearly get the underlined implications, and the smooth acting performances delivered by the protagonists. It starts at an old age home where a mysterious old man bursts uncontrollably into tears inexplicably on watching a motion picture clip from the yesteryears. He is pacified by his lady friend and the actual narration starts here about his history and what made him cry. Tom Hanks takes up the role of a chief prison guard Paul Edgecomb, in charge of a wing which houses the prisoners convicted to the death penalty. The narration takes on a unbiased approach while describing few inmates subjected to corporal punishment, at times even being empathetic towards them. The name of the movie stems from the fact that the path towards their capital punishment from their cells were covered with green weed and was ironically called The Last Mile signifying their last walk. Paul and his team are infested by another guard Percy Wetmore who flaunts his connections with the Governor and causes wanton mayhem, insulting prisoners and making a mockery of prison etiquettes. The piece is all about John Coffey(Duncan), the giant black convict on death row for raping and murdering two little girls and his ensuing deep relationship with Paul(Tom). Coffey delivers one of his most cherished performances. To see such a hulk of a man weeping like a kid and being ""afraid of darkness"" was awe-inspiring, such was his depth and involvement. As the movie progresses, Coffey does deeds of magic that defy logic like curing a pet mouse of a repentant fellow convict, and curing the dreaded cancer of the prison warden's wife. The bond and the trust that develops between him and Paul is just too good to be true. Paul is also suffering from bladder infections which is cured by Coffey with a touch. All the while Paul is made to believe in the existence of the ethereal, the power of the almighty through Coffey. He knows that Coffey was innocent and the significance of the words Coffey utters ""Boss, I could'nt bring 'em back"", referring to the dead girls in his ape like arms when he was caught supposedly red handed. This conflicting person with his heavenly powers and yet frail emotional attitude clouded Paul's mind. He thought of ways to save this angel from the death penalty by allowing him to run away to which the big man replies that he is tired of human dystopia and the way he has been washing the evils of the society. All of him could not bear human insolence any longer(as a 2nd Jesus Christ washing away the sins of humanity and suffering himself) and it was the right time for him to die. In the end Paul says that he has left some of his gifts with him like long life and the ability to see events. But I would remember this movie for just a single thing/one. Michael Clarke Duncan. The way he utters ""Boss"" referring to Hanks, depicts the humility of the towering 7 foot frame and sends a chill down your spine. The all pervading and all pervasive force can be so meek and innocent, devoid of vanity--but look at our disdain??"

However, this movie wasn't quoted as much as Django Unchained, Forrest Gump or various movies with comical lines.<br/><br/>That's because most of the movies experiences, whether it would be laughter, or crying or shock, come from the built up backstory. The writer of the script saw Stephen King more than capable of building up story to where things would seem to go normal then all the sudden pull the rugs out from under you once you realize the established norms of the story.<br/><br/>There is a multitude of unforgettable characters within the movie and each one of them being distinguished clearly and in the end all the characters are connected. You don't realize it at first, but towards the end of the movie all the characters were like puzzle pieces slowly revealed and put together to reveal the large masterpiece that is the Green Mile.<br/><br/>The overall theme of the movie as I interpret it can be interpreted into Christian themes as well as general themes. The first being that God places people in various places with an exact purpose and agenda. And the location of people can determine the impact of any circumstance.<br/><br/>The movie at times will make you laugh, it will make you cry and yes I know this is a cliché description, but this is literally the only movie that made me do this. Not even Empire Strikes Back, Django Unchained or Rocky could do that. The only movie coming close to doing that was Forrest Gump, but even then it's a stretch.<br/><br/>If you want a movie to play with your emotions like a flute, watch this movie. It might possibly change your life."

","People who haven't seen this film you really should! My friend told me to watch it and at first i wasn't very optimistic, it just didn't seem like a film i would generally enjoy. But taken my friends recommendation i watched it. I didn't get into it at first but after about 15 - 20 minutes i started to get into it. It is a really good film one of the best i have actually seen in my entire life. Just by watching it all the human emotions started to take effect at how certain scenes and plots took place. Especially towards 1 of the characters. It makes you feel really sad for said character. The producers and actors of this epic film have done really well at how the movie transpired throughout. I also think that they choose their actors really well. They seemed to fit the position they played to a pinch. Like i said if you haven't seen this film I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU WATCH THIS FILM otherwise you are missing out on one of the best movies ever created to mankind. sorry i'm really not good at writing reviews. Enjoy the film!"

","This must see movie created a whole new genre of its own. Although it might seem like another prison movie with an inspiring message, The Green Mile goes far beyond ordinary. Between a remarkable cast and flawless plot, The Green Mile will have audiences on a roller-coaster of emotions from beginning to end. Tom Hanks (Paul Edgecomb), a prison guard on death row, thinks that he has seen it all until John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) is brought in. John is convicted of raping and murdering two small girls; however, there is something mysterious about John. Standing twice as tall as the guards, John appears to be capable of harming even the strongest of men, but his demeanor is kind and it throws the audience for a loop. How could a man come off as being so harmless, brutally rape and murder two innocent girls? It is obvious that Michael Clarke Duncan molded himself into John Coffey. The audience can almost feel the emotional pain that John Coffey is going through as the cell door slams shut. It is nearly impossible to imagine the extreme pain that one would go through during an electric chair execution. Not only do the viewer's get to see the execution of Arlen Bitterbuck, but also an execution gone wrong with Eduard Delacroix, played by Michael Jeter. During the execution Michael Jeter's blood curdling screams were so powerful I found myself begging for his suffering to end. The intense physical reaction to the horrific execution demonstrates that the actors clearly did their homework on how to portray their characters. Death row is where the worst of the worst criminals go, and The Green Mile found the perfect actors to make the audience experience how uncontrollable the inmates can be. Tom Hanks, along with David Morse, take control of the unstable Wild Bill Wharton, whose past adds a shocking twist to the story. The Green Mile uses the full potential of the all-star cast to make the audience feel as though they are part of the crew on death row from the beginning of the movie to the very last second. <br/><br/>The relationship between John Coffey and Paul Edgecomb is not one that would be likely between a prison guard and an inmate. Since the moment that John is brought into death row, Paul realizes that there is something off about John and his story. Without a doubt, John could easily take down all of the guards and run free, however he doesn't. John stays calm and emits immense sorrow for the crimes he committed. While the other criminals are banging on their cells, John stays calm and pleasant with each of the guards. It isn't until Paul suffers from a painful urinary tract infection that the plot of the story takes a dramatic twist. It is hard to tell if this movie is considered part of the science fiction genre after John displays magical healing powers, helping Paul. A death row inmate going out of his way to help a sick guard? With each twist and turn of the plot in The Green Mile, the audience is thrown on a whirlwind of emotions. Throughout the first half of the movie the viewers get a taste of how frightening the life of a guilty inmate is, but what if the inmate was innocent? Not only does the plot of The Green Mile draw in the audience's emotions making them feel emotionally connected to the movie, but it also creates wonder in the minds of the audience. After watching the movie, I found myself thinking about what I would do if I were an innocent inmate. Never before have I felt as engaged in a film as I did with The Green Mile. It is truly a roller-coaster from start to finish with an ending that changed how I view society and the justice system. <br/><br/>The Green Mile is absolutely a must see movie for all who are looking for a movie that will leave them guessing up until the very last moment. There is not another film that could come close to the impact that The Green Mile has on its viewers. Between a remarkable cast who made the audience believe they were part of the film, and a plot that has unexpected twists, The Green Mile deserves the highest rating and a wide range of awards."

","The Green Mile really captured the life working in mile. Starting from the way they conversations and their attitude towards the prisoners, and of course the executions. It was so well structured and a well-paced movie. It made me feel as if I'm part of the security guards in the mile,not only because of the the great actors and perfect settings, also because there are many up-close camera angles that pulls audience inside the movie. It contained a great tale along with surprising mystical and supernatural events. I personally didn't expect all that. Tom Hanks made it so likable for the audience to get into the movie. Michael Clark Duncan was the key role in this movie. As John Coffey, Duncan really made the movie likable with his great performance portraying an eccentric person with his size and his mentality. Of course, this movie contained many violence and really uncomfortable situations which made the movie so realistic and believable. It's a remarkable movie and totally marked a success in a movie industry."

","Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the lead guard on Death Row which they call the Green Mile. One day, John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) is brought in for brutal rape and killing of two little girls. There is something different about the giant Coffey. There seems to be magic in him.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont has created an American fable out of Stephen King's story. This is definitely a slow tear jerker. There isn't any car chase or elaborate fights. What it gives is emotional action. The only minor problem is its running time. It's 3 hours which may be 30 minutes too long. As far as I'm concern, it reached it's climax at the warden's home. But the movie had to keep going for a while still. If Frank Darabont could trim that back, I think it would keep more of the emotional impact."
"dorotejatolic","8","0","1","2 August 2013"," Good movie that reflects injustice in our society system !
","The Green Mile is a must-see movie, that has wide range of things to see. Great actors, such as Tom Hanks and recently departed Michael Clarke Duncan, then you have a good portrayed characters and a symbolism of a film that includes injustice in the system, racism, kindness of a soul etc. Duncan's character is innocent and sentenced to death, mainly because of his Afro-American heritage. But throughout the movie we can see his whole character portrayed in detail, and feel sorry for him, at the end making us think about society, and where we stand in it, and how we can help. Overall, I highly recommend watching it if you haven't yet."
"alban01","Null","0","1","18 June 2013"," The Green Mile Film Review
","Pleass note that this review contains a ""spoiler"".<br/><br/>The Green Mile Film Review<br/><br/>The 1999 film, The Green Mile, is based on the 1996 Stephen King novel. The film is told as a look back of the life of a death row corrections officer, Paul Edgecomb, during the Great Depression of the 1930's, and the supernatural actions that took place during his employment with the penitentiary.<br/><br/>The plot of the film, The Green Mile, begins at the Cold Mountain Penitentiary and the corrections officer, Paul Edgecomb played by Tom Hanks, is in charge of death row, also known as the green mile, and the inmates that are housed there. Paul works with three other officers: Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell played by David Morse, Harry Terwilliger played by Jeffrey DeMunn, and Dean Stanton played by Barry Pepper. John Coffey played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is an inmate on death row that has been accused of the rape and murder of two white little girls. John Coffey's appearance is intimidating, as he is eight feet tall and huge, however he is very shy, soft-spoken, emotional, kind hearted, and scared individual. This is where one theme is presented in the film; you should not judge a book by its cover.<br/><br/>While Paul is watching over John he witnesses acts of super natural ability that John performs by healing Paul's urinary tract infection and bringing a mouse back to life that was killed. Eventually John heals the Warden Hal Moores's, played by James Cromwell, terminally ill wife that is dying of cancer. This is another theme presented in the film, to use your gifts wisely. When John is questioned about his super natural ability to heal he replies that he ""took it back"". Paul befriends John and tries to find out what happened to the two small girls, John states that he ""punished the bad men, but couldn't take it back"". John than takes Paul's hand, gives Paul apart of him, and shows Paul what really happened to the two girls. John was only trying to heal them. When it is time for John's execution, Paul is torn with letting him go or continuing with the execution. John is tired of all the pain and is ready to be executed. John takes the last mile, which is the walk from his cell to the execution chamber. After the execution, Paul goes on and lives to be 108 years old- a sure side effect of John giving a part of himself to Paul. However, John feels like his long life is a punishment from God for killing one of his miracles, and wonders how long it will be before he dies.<br/><br/>There are many themes in the film, The Green Mile, from God's calling for you, quilt or regret, miracles, wrongly accused, life after death, healing and forgiveness. The calling from God, when John touched Paul, Paul changed. Paul carried a lot of quilt and regret for allowing John, a miracle from God, to be executed. John Coffey was able to heal and restore life. Another film that deals with quilts or regrets, God's calling for you, life after death, healing and forgiveness is the film, Dead Man Walking.<br/><br/>Dark lighting used in the film, The Green Mile, represents fear and hope of the inmates. Hope for forgiveness and life after death. The light lightning, such as sunlight, represents the innocence of the two little girls that were raped and murdered. The colors used by the director were dull colors that represent the Great Depression and death row for the inmates. The motif presented in the film is the way John's takes it back, takes the bad or illness from someone. This is presented several times and involves John inhaling the badness or illness out of the other person, he inhales it, coughs it up and it comes out in a black mass.<br/><br/>According to Paul from The Green Mile 1999, ""And my curse is knowing that I'll be there to see it. It's my atonement, you see — it's my punishment for letting' John Coffey ride the lightning. For killing a miracle of God You'll be gone like all the others, and I'll have to stay. Oh, I'll die eventually; of that, I'm sure. I have no illusions of immortality. But I will have wished for death long before Death finds me. In truth I wish for it already. On the day of my judgment, when I stand before God, and he asks me whydid Idid I kill one of his true miracles.what am I going to say? That it was my job? It was my job."". This is a great quote from Paul that hits the nail on the head about the themes presented in the film, The Green Mile."

","This movie was very well done. It makes you think long and hard about your opinion on the death penalty and if it is the correct thing to do. This movie is very deep. It has a lot of feeling and emotion to it. The setting was put together well, by taking place within the Great Depression years of the United States. I liked how they portrayed the prison. The acting was done very well. The movie almost made you feel like you were there. The dialog was done very well in this movie also. Great story, plot, acting, and well directed. If you want a movie to make you think twice about something you do, this is the one. It will make you think if you're doing good or bad. Perhaps your just a person doing something for someone you think is good, but really isn't <br/><br/>The actors put a lot of emotion and effort into their acting. They all played their parts very well. They made portraying a early 1900's prison guard as simple as it could get. <br/><br/>The storyline is also surely very well done as well. I think who has never seen The Green Mile would enjoy, and appreciate, the film. One of the best ones, in my opinion, by Stephen King. That's for sure."

SPOILER AFTER THIS POINT: When John died at the end of a movie you feel a bit weird and sad, I can not describe the feeling.

","I don't believe in much, but I do believe that miracles exist. Weather it's all part of the grand design or just abnormalities of nature, I'll never know, none of us will. This theme is explored in the novel and film, The Green Mile. How Stephen King came up with such a poignant and heartfelt tale is beyond me, maybe it was divine intervention, but the story of the Green Mile is a unique and moving film, the likes of which I've never seen before. The story centers around a man who is sent to death row, and once there he is able to doing seemingly impossible things. The performances in this film were Oscar worthy, building on the success of their last collaboration, The Shawshank Redemption, King and Durabont, got the biggest star in Hollywood to star in this film. The combination of a strong sentimental story along with the acting power of Tom Hanks made this film one for the ages. The supporting cast, in particular Michael Clarke Duncan and Sam Rockwell, were tremendous assets to the film and their careers were launched with the help of Hanks's experience and King's amazing words, but this film is far from perfect. As an avid Stephen King fan, I know his attention to detail has often times been his downfall and to be honest, this film is about an hour longer than it needed to be. The story, in particular the ending were so powerful, that a lot of the in between could have been left on the cutting room floor. That aside, this is a long, but fantastic film with some of the best writing and performances you could find. Like many classic films the critics love, it's a bit long, parts of it are somewhat boring, and the storyline isn't for everybody, there are plenty of people who just won't get it. I did get it and I feel the better for it. This is one of those films, love it or hate it, that everyone should see at least once."
"cat_ranchero","9","0","1","21 October 2012"," Excellent and emotional!...
","Very well made with a beautifully understated musical score by Thomas Newman, it underpins the action perfectly and works very well. All the performances were great; particularly Michael Clarke Duncan who fully deserved his 2000 Oscar nomination for his portrayal of John Coffey. As usual, Tom Hanks puts in a flawless performance as Paul Edgecomb (the younger version of course). Also worthy of note were; David Morse as Brutus 'Brutal' Howell, Bonnie Hunt as Edgecomb's wife, Jan, James Cromwell as Warden Hal Moores, Michael Jeter as Eduard Delacroix, Graham Greene as Arlen Bitterbuck, Doug Hutchison as Percey Wetmore, Sam Rockwell as 'Wild Bill' Wharton, Barry Pepper as Dean Stanton and Jeffrey DeMunn as Harry Terwilliger. Oh and not forgetting the mouse (or mice) who appeared as 'Mr Jingles'.<br/><br/>The film has quite a slow pace that allows the audience to become familiar with the characters and the comings and goings on 'The Mile'. With most of the action taking place in the one location I thought the director did a good job of using different angles and even the odd special effect to keep it visually interesting. Because you become so invested in the characters, it is three hours long after all; it does tend to get a bit emotional towards the end. This is probably one of the reasons I love this film so much. Stephen King does write such well rounded and interesting characters and Frank Darabont has the knack of being able to translate them to the screen. In my book this is one of the very best adaptations of King's work and one that will stay with me for a very long time.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>My score: 9.1/10<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

","Probably one of the most emotional films ever made. Stephen King's novel shows us the true extent of mankind, sacrifice and justice in this film. John Coffey, played by the late Michael Duncan is an amazing character that is sadly put up on death throw for a murder he did not commit. The thing about John is that he isn't the same as everyone else, as Paul, the main prison guard, played by Tom Hanks discovers. John throughout the film performs amazing miracles and when asked is there anything that can be done for him, he denies it and makes the sacrifice knowing that where he is going is better than earth. A gripping classic that you will need to watch again and again to appreciate it's legacy."

"thewillt08","8","0","1","20 September 2012"," 3 Hours of Brilliance
","In honor of Michael Clarke Duncan, may his soul rest in peace. The Green Mile is based off the novel by the one and only Stephen King so I knew the movie was going to be interesting to say the least. It is about a death row guard from 1935 who gets his life changed forever when he meets John Coffey. Duncan plays a massive, black, man on death row. He is sentenced to death because he savagely murdered two young girls. Coffey has explained powers which adds twists and turns to this story. This movie had very unexpected parts and by the end I was satisfied and definitely surprised. <br/><br/>John Coffey's first lines are him asking if they leave the lights on at night because he is scared of the dark sometimes. The look on Paul's face made the entire scene. Here stands a large, black, man who could lift a truck asking to leave the lights on. Its little comic moments like that which makes this movie different and unexpected. There were little bits of comedy in one of the most depressing places on the planet. Mr. Jingles is very symbolic. The little mouse runs around, becomes a thorn in Percy's side, and befriends Del and Paul. He is more than a mouse and more of an actual character. Tom Hanks delivers another fantastic performance as the star in this film. He has a bladder disease or some disease which makes it hard to use the bathroom. I thought that would have been very important to the story but it was and was not at the same time. It was a problem that got solved quickly, possibly halfway into the movie. Paul is his name and he has to deal with many problems such as, inmates, Percy the spoiled guard, Mr. Jingles the rat, and sometimes John Coffey and what he believes is right. John Coffey has this special power that is never really explained. That really bugged me but how could one have explained it. Coffey claims he can see life and see who's a good man and a bad man. I don't even think he understands and it adds uniqueness to his character. He touches Paul right in the crotch and cures him of his bladder disease. That was fine but in the beginning it seemed like it was going to be a big problem throughout the movie and it was gone and forgotten in a matter of minutes. Coffey can resurrect the dead, extend life, control others, and cure illness. When Del got the electric chair he felt the electricity going through his body and he felt the same pain. It was strange but fascinating. Every movie has a villain; I'm talking about Percy of course. The rich, spoiled, spoon-fed brat who likes to bully prisoners around just because he can. He is small and annoying but he is crafty. He is the real rat, not Mr. Jingles. He is the nephew of the Governor and he can get away with anything he wants. I hated him and hope he gets put on the chair. Del made Percy wet his pants in fear and Percy was embarrassed. Percy got back at him by stepping on Mr. Jingles and killing him. Luckily Coffey was able to revive Mr. Jingles and save his life. Percy had the final word when he did not wet the sponge when Del was sentenced to death. The sponge needs to be wet so it acts as a conductor so the electricity goes to the brain. Instead he fries, and screams, and gets lit on fire. It was gruesome and almost hard to watch. His shrieks and screams and the reaction of the people in the execution room were terrible. He smelled and was burning, smoke was everywhere and they tried to escape. The electricity could not be stopped because he was still alive, so he suffered. No man deserves that and he suffered because of the little rat Percy. Luckily, that little slime ball got his in the end. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Throughout the movie Coffey uses his power but he was still sentenced to death. In a way he wanted to die, he didn't want to live with his gift anymore. He righted some wrongs and it was hard for him to be executed. The guards cared about him and did not want to see him die. Paul shook his hand before he gave the order. A mask is usually put over the face of the prisoner but Coffey wanted it to remain uncovered because he is afraid of the dark. That was so powerful, out of respect his last wished are granted and it was not fair but it was what needed to happen. The most significant part of his death was the reaction of the guards. In every other execution the camera was focused on the prisoner. When Coffey died the camera was not on him at all, it was on the guards who he impacted. A few were in tears and the biggest, toughest guard was fighting back tears. It was powerful, meaningful, symbolic, and important. Before he died he passes something to Paul and we go back to Paul as an old man. His wife he is with doesn't really believe his story but Paul shows her a little box, a box with Mr. Jingles inside of it. He lived all those years. John passed long life to both Mr. Jingles and Paul. The movie closes with Paul saying life is one long green mile. Overall, The Green Mile was three full hours of great cinema. I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves Stephen King and Tom Hanks. You have to invest your time into it and pay attention. I would see it again, I bought it, not on Blu Ray but it really doesn't matter. The Green Mile gets the WillyT seal of approval."

","In my 14 years on this Earth, I have seen quite a few great films, such as the godfather, pulp fiction, Shawshank redemption, usual suspects, silence of the lambs, and many more. But I have to say that this tops them all. Some may consider this movie a tad to long, I disagree. I think Darabont directed a story like this to its appropriate length, any longer would have been too long, and more than a few minutes shorter would have made the ending less dramatic. This was one of the three movies that brought me to tears. The acting was superb. Tom Hanks put on a performance equally spectacular as his performance in Forrest Gump. Although, I must say that the best performance of the film was not Hanks, but Michael Clarke Duncan as the magical John Coffey (like the drink but not spelled the same). Duncan portrayed the gentle giant exactly as Stephen King intended. (The Green Mile is based of a Stephen King Novel) I purchased this film for 6 dollars at Newbury comics, and I must say that it was perhaps the best 6 dollars i have ever spent. Doug Hutchison as the evil Percy Wetmore was also superb. I was in tears the last 25 minutes of the film. The Green Mile was truly the most unforgettable film I have seen in my entire, and should be much higher than 68 on IMDb's all time list. This film will stay with me my whole life, and I don't know how someone can top Frank Darabont's masterpiece. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys quality entertainment."

","Anyone who has ever been to the pictures with me will tell you that I can't sit still for very long. I am having a Stephen King phase right now though, and my husband hadn't seen this one before (I had seen it once before) so we watched disc 1 one evening and disc 2 the next. It's 189 minutes – that's too long to sit in front of a screen. But of course it's based on a Stephen King six-part series, so there's a lot of story to get in.<br/><br/>I love this kind of story. I'm a fan of magical realism and I'm a fan of what I shall term the ""Kingian coincidence"" where the characters in many of his stories are linked by a veeeeerrry unlikely chance event as they are towards the end of this story (not saying who – it's ""only"" about two and three quarter hours in, though).<br/><br/>In short, it's about a gentle giant, John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, who is found guilty of the brutal rape and murder of two little girls and goes to Death Row, where the head of the guards is played by Tom Hanks. The opening of the story, the situation that gets John Coffey caught and arrested for murder reminds me so much of ""Of Mice and Men"", and coincidentally (or not?) one of the main actors from the film adaptation of that (the bloke off CSI: NY) has a small part in this as the careless lawyer who doesn't really bother to properly represent John Coffey because he is black.<br/><br/>There's the typical list of characters, of the prisoners; an ashamed an sorrowful one, a comedy one, a bad-to-the-bone one, and John, the one you really don't think ought to be there. Most of the guards are all-round good chaps, but one of them is a slimy, evil, low-life that makes your skin crawl. You can probably guess that he gets his come-uppance.<br/><br/>In his book ""On Writing"" his royal highness Stephen King tells us that he had originally named John something beginning with D, but renamed him something beginning with C because he believes if a character has the initials JC (like the world's most famous fictional character, Jesus Christ) then we will feel sorrier for him. Well, there is doubt from the start that he is guilty, for the viewers, at least. So, a black man in rural 1930s deep south America, accused of murder? I don't really need the initials to make me feel any sorrier for him.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful and tragic story. I don't want to spoil the ending, but King said that while he was writing it, even he didn't know if John Coffey would die at the end. What a lovely way to write – then he gets to enjoy his own stories as much as we do.<br/><br/>more reviews http://claiready.wordpress.com/"

","Death is not sad by essence for no one can ever experience the sadness of his own death. But death is sad because it takes from us the persons we loved and loved us, those who witnessed our lives or a part of it, those who shared with us the happiest or saddest moments. And death is also the measure of love, as we only realize the value of people when we miss them. And while ""The Green Mile"" is set in a prison's death row, but it tackles the subject of death to better highlight the value of love.<br/><br/>Love, maybe more than any other feeling, requires patience, trust and understanding. In simpler terms, it takes its time, and so does ""The Green Mile"". It might be three-hour long but like so many great films, it never feels too long, which wouldn't surprise if you consider the name of the director, Frank Darabont. Like its glorious predecessor, ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""The Green Mile"" embraces the passing of time with a gripping melancholy, leaving us at the end with a haunting sensation, conveyed by the titular metaphor.<br/><br/>The Green Mile refers to the last mile walked by the condemned prisoner to the execution, and as explained by the old Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer in a quite moving performance): ""the floor was the color of faded limes"", hence the color. Of course, the distance is shorter than a mile, but when we get to the core of the allegory, we see that we're all sentenced to death (""We all owe a death"" as says Paul) so we all, technically, have green miles of various distances. Paul Edgecomb is the hero of the film and he tells in flashback, a story set in 1935, the very year he met John Coffey, a giant black man, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, sentenced to death for the murder and the raping of two white little girls.<br/><br/>To say that Michael Clarke Duncan delivered a magnificent performance would not only be an understatement as gigantic as his body, but it would overlook the performances of the entire cast: David Morse as Brutal Howell, the tallest and strongest guard, James Cromwell as Hal, the comprehensive warden and Patricia Clarkson, his cancer-stricken wife. The cast also includes Doug Hutchinson as Percy Whitmore, a sadistic little guard; Barry Pepper as one of the same age, much more appreciated. And in the death row, there's Michael Jeter as the simple-minded Cajun Eduard Delacroix aka Ed, and the pervert Bill Wharton, played by Sam Rockwell. If I add Harry Dean Stanton and Graham Greene in smaller roles, you have one of the greatest casts ever featured in a film.<br/><br/>The cast plays a significant part because these are people we care about, no matter how big or small their roles are, each one shines at a moment or another, providing an extra level of depth in characterization, and when they leave us, we can't help but feel something cruelly missing, as if we were really experiencing death as a human loss. But aside from the acting, the directing and the writing are responsible for this level of empathy we feel. Indeed, the film doesn't embarrass itself with subtleties or nuances when it comes to the characters, the guards are all sympathetic and Percy is clearly the main antagonist, doing everything to be unpopular both among the guards and the viewers. And in the prisoners' group, while they're all bad people by society's standards, only Wild Bill stands out as the evil one. In the hand of another director, this wouldn't have worked, but with Darabont it does.<br/><br/>Darabont may not be the best director of his generation, nor the best writer, but he's got one rare talent: he's a wonderful storyteller. And this talent shows in his films, he has a unique ability to transport you in his universe with such respect and carefulness that you forget all the elements that could undermine the believability of the story. How can the death row's corrections officer guards be so mild-mannered? How wasn't John Coffey lynched at the very minute he was found grabbing two little girls' bodies in his arms, what's more, by a Southern angry mob? Why falling in the 'Magic Negro' stereotype again? I was so mesmerized by the story, and so focused on the supernatural power of Coffey and the bonding it inspired in the block E, that I unconsciously wiped all these considerations.<br/><br/>And I enjoyed ""The Green Mile"" for what it was, a great MOVIE. And I emphasize the word 'movie' because there's a sort of genius in the way Darabont sticks to cinematic conventions. Darabont never hesitates to use archetypes because he's confident over his material; he knows that his screenplay is adapted from one hell of a story, written by the king Stephen. And it sure pays off, the story has the thrills of the electric chairs scenes, the heart-pounding horrific moment when the machinery goes wrong, it has the laughs, the joy, the emotion, and even a nice little comic relief incarnated by a little mouse named Mister Jingles. And not falling into the trap of anti-death penalty patronizing statements, the film speak much deeper truths about life and death, and the way love play the crucial and sometimes heart-breaking role of a missing link.<br/><br/>The film does sometimes get a little too emotional, efficiently taking some tears from our eyes, but even tears can make us miss the more powerful message of the film for men, about the way they can miss the very purpose of life by turning evil, as one of the most insightful illustrations of evil is given, as something that exploits the best side of us for malicious schemes. Like death, you only feel evil, when it takes those you love. The film is too intelligent for its emotionality  sometimes. But nonetheless, its profound beauty always takes me  off-guard."
"billcr12","8","0","1","14 March 2012"," Stephen King via Darabont
","Frank Darabont directed The shawshank redemption which is the highest rated movie of all time on IMDb. The green mile is similarly themed with a prison as the backdrop. Stephen King wrote the original story upon which the film is based and the two are a hell of a combination.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is Paul, the officer in charge of the last mile, or the green mile, in this case. John Coffey(Michael Clarke Duncan) is on death row, awaiting execution in the electric chair for the rape and murder of two little white girls; Coffey is black and there are strong overtones of racial prejudice in the case.<br/><br/>Coffey is possessed of mystical and healing powers which he uses to help as many people as possible. The writer and director are a wonderful tandem and green mile is a must see."
"absolut2","8","0","1","18 February 2012"," Awesome
","A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is coloured by this. Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan.<br/><br/>It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camera-work is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation.<br/><br/>All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. Five out of five."

","Starring: Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Doug Hutchison, and Gary Sinise Written and directed by Frank Darabont. Running Time: 180 minutes. Rated R (for scenes of strong disturbing violence, language, and some sexuality) By Blake French: It's not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. ""The Green Mile"" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. ""The Green Mile"" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe.<br/><br/>The story is more of a personal narrative than an actual plot. The film offers an interesting perspective of the events that take place. It is seen through the eyes of a man who is over one hundred years of age, Paul Edgecomb, who is currently living in an old folks home with his friend, Elaine. During a very emotional day for Paul, he tells Elaine of a historical year in his experiences. She listens closely to his story.<br/><br/>He tells of a particular year in the 1930's. The setting is a beautifully crafted prison hall. Paul explains he used to be a kind prison guard on death row in charge of overseeing the executions. In this year, several significant activities occurred in his life: he had a terribly painful urinary infection, and met a prisoner named John Coffey. This man has been sentenced to the electric chair for the rape and murder of two innocent little girls. This man isn't like anyone else Paul has seen, however. Aside from being massive in size, he is humble, mild mannered, and caring. After several miraculous events take place that may point to the thought that John Coffey might have magical powers from God, Paul begins to doubt the crimes this so called criminal has been convicted of.<br/><br/>Throughout the story we witness three executions that in an electric chair. These capital punishment sequences have much power and significance. The electrocutions, one in particular, contain some of the most unsettling, disturbing material in film history. The movie is anti death penalty; we see the sometimes sadistic world from the prisoner guards point of view. It will put you in their shoes--and perhaps, change your opinion on the death penalty. I certainly had to think about my stand on this issue."

","Frank Darabont again presents us a gritty look at prison life. But unlike his previous work, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile focuses not on the prisoners, but on the prison guards. The movie does a great job depicting both the humanity and the brutality that takes place inside the wooden jailhouse, dubbed ""the Green Mile"", where men sentenced to death row reside. Head guard Paul Edgecomb, played by the ever-amazing Tom Hanks, is disturbed by the gut-wrenching crime committed by new inmate John Coffey (Michael Duncan), but as he comes to know the gentle giant he begins to believe that John is actually innocent. This summary sounds simple enough, but once you reach the middle of the film, you find out that John is morelet's say, different from anyone else you've ever met.<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, Mile has a great unpredictable plot, amazing acting (especially from Hanks and Duncan), a wonderful script, and excellent direction. But it falls short, lacking the majestic spirit Shawshank embodies. One reason could be the static characters. They never seem to grow in wisdom or maturity. Sure the good guys are affected by John Coffey, but they never become better people; they have been practically faultless to begin with. And the bad guys, from start to finish, are cruel, sadistic psychos. Why they are so despicably evil is never explained, which bothers me since I like to see characters in shades of gray, not in black and white. But really, this is a just a pet peeve, and this mystery by no means diminishes the antagonists into cartoonish villains. Doug Hutchinson gives an electrifying performance as the cowardly bully Percy, who commits one of the most bloodcurdling atrocities I've ever seen on screen, and will incur utter disgust and rancor from anyone who has a beating heart. Still, I wish there could have been more character development in at least somebody. Another reason I didn't enjoy the movie as much is that it ends on a glum weird note, in stark contrast to Shawshank's optimistic and beautiful closure. The ending isn't dismal, but it definitely isn't happy either, and I am a sucker for happy endings.<br/><br/>Overall, watching this film is like undergoing surgery without anesthetics: the process is painful, and when it's done, you feel better, but the experience will haunt you for a long time afterward. Okay, I'm exaggerating about the pain part (I just have a real weak stomach) but you will definitely be haunted by this film. If you want to feel ghostly chills, engross yourself in a heart-breaking plot, and experience intense drama, this is it."
"moviesleuth2","7","0","2","21 June 2010"," Better than the material
","Many films that take place in the deep south have a homey, nostalgic tone to them that feels like you're revisiting faded memories. ""The Green Mile"" does that, but even though it has strong performances and solid characterization, the story just doesn't quite work.<br/><br/>Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is a prison guard on Death Row in a Louisiana Prison. Prisoners come in and stay until it's their turn to die, then more prisoners are moved in to take their place. One day, a prisoner is brought in, just like any other. Only this prisoner, named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), is a towering giant of a man whose size intimidates and shocks everyone there. What's more shocking is the first thing that Coffey says: ""Do you leave the lights on after bedtime? I get kinda scared in the dark."" Slowly, Paul begins to question whether Coffey has indeed killed the two little girls that he was convicted of. But Coffey holds a secret that will change everything that Paul believes in.<br/><br/>The acting is very good and the characters are well-developed. Tom Hanks is always good, and he's great as the uncertain Paul, but he's willing to become a believer. Michael Clarke Duncan shines as the hulking gentle giant. The shock of seeing this giant man be so childlike is overcome by his terrific performance. Doug Hutchinson is terrifically vile as the sadistic and spoiled Percy; it doesn't take long for the audience to hate him. David Morse, the late Michael Jeter, Barry Pepper, James Cromwell, Sam Rockwell, Bonnie Hunt and a brief appearance by Patricia Clarkson all provide able support.<br/><br/>Darabont's previous film was the similarly themed but inferior (and outlandishly overrated) ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (it's good, but belongs nowhere near the IMDb Top 250, much less at the top). Unfortunately, the story goes into sitcom-territory in the final hour, and try as they might, Darabont and his cast can't bridge that problem.<br/><br/>""The Green Mile"" is wholly watchable, and I don't hesitate to recommend the film. For those in a very undemanding mood and who like this kind of movie, it will probably turn out to be a real winner. Even if you're not in this group (which encompasses a large amount of people), it's still a good film."
"revere-7","10","0","1","5 October 2009"," A case study in changing perceptions
","The Green Mile<br/><br/>I often tell people when evaluating a film one ought to it in terms of its time. But, in the case of The Green Mile, it's helpful to be able to view this with the benefit of hindsight. Rarely has a film been the object of such changing perceptions as The Green Mile.<br/><br/>A decade after the film's release, it's one of the most loved films of the 1990s, and is currently ranked in the Internet Movie Database's top 20 fantasy films of all time, beating out such notables as The Wizard of Oz, Toy Story and King Kong.<br/><br/>But it wasn't always so for The Green Mile. At the time of it's release it got mixed reviews by critics – according to Rotten Tomatoes dot com, only about 70% of the top critics gave it a good review.<br/><br/>To understand why this is, we have to transport ourselves back to the 90s. The last film to make it to the big screen by both the writer, Stephen King, and the director, Frank Darabont, was a film called The Shawshank Redemption, widely considered to be one of the greatest cinematic achievements in history (just as a point of reference, the Internet Movie Database lists Shawshank as #1 on the list of 250 top movies of all time). Whether or not you agree with that, just understand that Shawshank connected with audiences and critics both in a very powerful way.<br/><br/>In addition, The Green Mile was also set during the first half of the 20th Century, and also in a prison – comparisons to Shawshank were inevitable, and given King's hiatus (imposed by a horrible accident), and the fact that The Green Mile was Darabont's follow up to Shawhank, his directing debut, anticipation was at an all time high.<br/><br/>The Shawshank Redemption cast such a long shadow over The Green Mile, that it's nearly impossible to find any Green Mile review from the time that does not mention it. When compared to such a monumental achievement, is it any wonder that The Green Mile was found lacking?<br/><br/>But, take Shawshank out of the equation, and suddenly the picture becomes very, very different. Judged on it's own merits, The Green Mile is an outstanding motion picture. I'm not going to waste time summarizing the plot, or praising the acting, I'm just going to say that everything about this film is well done, and even though it's 188 minutes long, it's worth every minute. And just like the previous dramas, Stand By Me and The Shawshank Redemption it ends with one of those brilliant Stephen King lines that both summarizes the journey and hammers home the theme brilliantly.<br/><br/>Outstanding."

","Frank Darabont seems to be very much obsessed with Prison, Prison Guards and Prisoner's stories. So after the classic, much appreciated 'The Shawshank Redemption', he chose a fantasy Prison story based on the novel of Stephen King (Once again) as his next venture. The story occurs in flashback which is narrated by an old man in a old age home. The old man narrates his story that goes back to the 1930's when he was 40 and the head Prison Guard of a section of the Prison called 'The Green Mile'. In The Green Mile those prisoners are kept who have been given the death sentence and would be send to the electric chair after some days. One fine day, the 'Green Mile' has a new prisoner who is enormous in size (Almost like an Adult Grizzly Bear Standing Up) and who has been given the death sentence for killing and raping two small girls. As time passes by, the prison guards come to know that this prisoner has got some magical healing powers and he actually has not committed the crime after all. Tom Hanks as the head Prison Guard has given his patent restrained performance. The three actors who impressed me were Michael Duncan playing the enormous prisoner, Sam Rockwell and Doug Hutchison. Overall, the only flaw of this movie is that it is 3 hours long"
"gremma","8","0","2","5 September 2009"," Credit where credit is due
","The Green Mile is absolutely my favorite Stephen King movie. It is the only one that starts out well and continues being very good to the end. Many of the others seemed to start out well, had a good plot idea, held your interest, but then towards the end unraveled, almost as if someone was hurrying him to finish. The Green Mile was nearly flawless. The characters were well defined, and very well acted. We definitely came to have an opinion of them, some we liked very much and some we really did not like, especially ""Wild Bill,"" could there be a character we dislike more? Percy was a very close second, someone we did not like at all. It made you wonder exactly which side of the bars Percy should have been on, as mean and nasty as he could be. I was actually surprised when I found out it was a Stephen King based novel. I don't mean to take away from his writing, once handed over to Hollywood, the person writing the screen play may not have an understanding how the characters were woven together and how important it was to leave the ""weaving"" completely unchanged to keep the tone of the story. I'm sure Stephen King is big enough now to get writers' approval of what has been done, if he's not writing the screenplay himself. The Green Mile was perfectly woven, the good guys were good, and the bad guys were bad, I mean you really did not like them at all. I didn't even like ""Wild Bill"" in the next movie he appeared in remembering the evil character he played in this film. I found it so disarming that the regular guards, Paul (Tom Hanks); Brutus (David Morse); Dean (Barry Pepper); and Harry (Jeffrey DeMunn) of ""The Green Mile"" were so calm, and made an effort to make an atmosphere pleasant for these men who were doomed to die anyway. I hadn't even thought about it one way or the other; they are bad men, why would we want to be civil with them at all? But the way they thought of them, they were found guilty and they are going to die, treating them like the animals they acted like was not necessary, they were already getting the maximum punishment, that provocation would only make them more dangerous, after all, they have nothing left to lose, it pays to treat them with dignity and respect, which had they ever been treated that way in the past maybe they wouldn't be there at all, keeping them calm and relaxed so that they are less trouble. They had a good thing going until Percy was transferred to The Mile. This man was sadistic, and felt he was ""bullet-proof"" as far as his job was concerned since his Mother was the Governor's wife. No rules applied to Percy, he did what he wanted when he wanted, there was a part of him that belonged on the other side of the bars. John Coffey saw this in him, and definitely saw Wild Bill for who he was, a ""gift"" John was tired of dealing with on a weekly, daily, hourly basis, seeing into the hearts and minds of people during the depression, heck, probably anytime, and seeing the darkness of souls is something I wouldn't consider a ""gift"" either. His true ""gift"" was that he could heal people. The scene in which he first ""sees"" what is in the Warden's wife and then removes it is very powerful. You see her at first visibly very ill and not in her right mind, then you see John Coffey take it out and she looks like herself again. She knows she is grateful to him, but not why; it is a very moving scene. John my not seem smart but he sure does the smart thing; he takes the brain tumor from the warden's wife and then gives it to Percy, who then takes out his gun out and shoots ""Wild Bill,"" he got both cruel men with one single act. It was true justice. Then Paul (Tom Hanks) and the other guards come to realization that they are going to have to kill this man; knowing he is innocent, and understanding that he has a gift to heal people; but they do not know what cost this gift has, so they don't understand he'd rather end it all so he can stop hearing all the bad things in people's minds. He is a black man in 1930's, so kindness is not what he sees in those minds. Just for being who he is will automatically bring out the worst of white people in the South. He'd consider it a favor if they would put and end to it all, but to give Paul a glimpse of what he sees everyday he ""shows"" Paul what he's seen to convince him that killing him would be like putting down a wounded animal. Putting people down must not be a very good job, but like the rest of the earth's species, there are many born with malady's that make them unfit to move with the regular heard. If there was a way to simply ""exile"" them from the populous, like the animal kingdom does, though many do also simply kill them. But if you do this for a living, it must be very difficult if you do not have an attitude and set of standards to stick to that makes it as simple as it can be. Best Stephen King movie I've ever seen, it is a very good movie, a little dark, but if you watch the news every night, you know the dark side exists in all of us, and shows itself more often in many. Very good movie!"
"johnmschofield","10","0","2","25 July 2009"," Wonderfully moving
","To anybody who has not seen this film and is going too, I would give a few words of advice. Allow over three hours to watch from beginning to end in one sitting. Settle down with something to eat and drink and take in this visual treat. Do not miss a second and be prepared to have all your emotions worked on and to be thoroughly drained but pleased at the end. What more can anybody ask from any film ? Unless you do that sort of thing normally don't be distracted by the stars who appear, the film is a sum of all of its parts and in my opinion there are no weak parts. You might want to keep some tissues close by though I certainly needed them and if you watch this in a cinema there probably wont be a dry eye in the place. Ultimately this film will make you think about all sorts of issues but wait till after it finishes to do this. Anyway judge for yourself and enjoy the experience."

After I just had to read the novel, Stephen King, you have done a great job as usual.<br/><br/>It was casted fantastically. Hanks was just right for the part of Paul Edgecomb. Michael Clark Duncan did an amazing part of John Coffy, (""like the drink, only not spelt the same""). He should have one an Oscar award. Everyone did great for their roles.<br/><br/>Filmed and directed fantastically. Darabont couldn't do any better It is kept really close to the novel with no added scenes or added characters, which is a good thing.<br/><br/>They did great with The Shawshank Redemption, but this is by far better.<br/><br/>I recommend you read the book first before watching the film. They are definitely worth the read and watch.<br/><br/>Well done Stephen and Frank"

","On death row Paul Edgecomb's (Hanks) life takes a turn when he meets John Coffy (Duncan) a giant of a man gifted with supernatural powers.<br/><br/>The adaptations of Stephen King's novels are something special. From the politically correct Shawshank Redemption to the psychotic Misery, King has written some marvellous entertainment and so far there has yet to be a bad adaptation and this 1999 Darabont adaptation is right up there with his other classics.<br/><br/>Nominated for 4 Oscars, The Green Mile takes the concept of death and puts a supernatural twist on it which makes for a long but riveting viewing.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont returned after his Shawshank Redemption and uses that wonderful artistic styled direction to create the emotion of the time and situation. The sweeping shots of the death row, juxtaposed with some carefully chosen cinematic setting sweeps helps create an artistic and importantly emotional feel of the time the film is set, in the early 1930's. The colour is significant to the film with a articulate choice in settings, having green tiled floors and dark dismal rooms to accompany that harrowing feeling of death.<br/><br/>Whilst not especially looking at the aftermath of death, the Green Mile explores the agonizing wait that accompanies the inmates till their sentence. The long walks and procedures are explored in a drawn out process that will send a tingle up your back. The film contains the most harrowing and dramatic death penalty scenes to ever appear in cinematic history. This in particular is the reason for the 18 certificate and is not for the faint hearted. It will remain with you long after viewing.<br/><br/>The story is consistent in its message to portray the difficulties of life up to death. The dramatic realism is never far away but The Green Mile is more than a preaching drama. The inclusion of the supernatural gives it an edge, an openness that leaves many questions. The mouse to is an interesting inclusion that draws a line on the fantasy genre.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks never lets viewers down and is once again at the top of his game. It is however Michael Clarke Duncan who steals the limelight as John Coffy, a giant on death row. His Oscar nominated performance will create tears and sympathy and is a fine inclusion to this picture which despite being too long is a fine drama that shocks, preaches and haunts."

","A Great Movie! Yes i'm writing this 10 years after it was released, but i was compelled to give my opinion.<br/><br/>This movie centers around 1940's death row, and has many interesting characters that center around a head officer and a huge black prisoner. The meek giant has the power to see into people lives and heal the sick.<br/><br/>Now throw in a slew of top notch actors and you have yourself a great cast, well written story, and will keep your interest throughout.<br/><br/>I liked that this movie didn't really show the racism side of life.<br/><br/>It's a long movie, 3 hours with commercials, but it's worth watching.<br/><br/>A+ all the way"

","Hey everyone, this is my first comment for IMDb. This is the one of the few movies that i found very sad. I don't cry a lot - i actually never cry - but this movie did the job. One would say Tom hanks does a very good job in this movie. From of the start of the movie one gets dragged in the story, and gets out of it a week later. It just takes you away, and it makes you think about what you think is right and wrong. The music just finishes it all. Most of the movie-watchers do not concentrate on the music, but if you'd try for this movie, i think u would have some tunes in your head for the upcoming month. If you have not yet seen this movie, then now is the time, be careful though, it could be you will be thinking of this movie all week!"
"ridiculonius","10","0","2","17 November 2008"," Pure Brilliance
","And when I say that, I mean everything about this film is pure brilliance. The acting, the dialog, the direction, EVERYTHING. Surprisingly enough, the film and the novel by Stephen King walk hand-in-hand; it's one of the best book-to-movie creations I have ever seen. Michael Clark-Duncan and Tom Hanks give absolutely AMAZING performances; these are two very talented actors who give a depth and immortality to the characters they portray. It's very important as an actor to make the characters, even ones with bad lines, seem human and believable, and both Hanks and Clark-Duncan managed it effortlessly.<br/><br/>The movie is about Paul Edgecombe (Hanks), who works as a prison guard on death row, on a block called the Green Mile by it's inhabitants because of the lime-green colour of the floor. He's seen it all, sexual predators, victims of drink and a bad temper, simple cold-blooded murder, anything you can think of. Which is why he is so unnerved by John Coffey (Clark-Duncan), the simple-minded and monstrously huge man convicted of the rape and murder of two little girls. Coffey is gentle and possesses the mind of a child, and Edgecombe is doubtful that this sweet hulk could possibly be guilty of the crimes he is charged with. And when Coffey demonstrates his miraculous power to cure any illness, even death (if he's quick enough), Paul and the other guards of the Green Mile face a difficult decision; follow orders and execute John Coffey, or do what they can to preserve a miracle? <br/><br/>Of course, some scenes are predictable, and some clichés are in there, but hey, it's nearly impossible to do anything anymore without adding something that's been done before. The music and directing is beautiful and emotional. The acting and dialog is capable of inducing a steady flow of tears that won't end till after the credits have rolled. The Green Mile is a truly brilliant film -- I can't see why anybody wouldn't like it! Once more, pure brilliance."

","The elements were all in their proper place at the time this film went into production. You cannot ask for such a wonderful melding of plot, actors, cinematography, etc. in one film! The movie was aired on television last night, and it brought back to my memory my first impression when I saw this in the theater. I will not go into the story line because others have done that very well, however, I will give you my initial impressions.<br/><br/>This film gets in your face, grabs you by your lapels and stares unblinking into your eyes. You cannot look away! You do not want to look away! You feel like you should not look away! <br/><br/>When the film reached its emotional climax you could cut the tension in the room with a knife. Several people in the theater (both men and women) were sobbing very softly and quietly in response to what they had just experienced. As the movie ended (no one could believe they had just sat through a three hour movie) and the credits began to scroll, I looked around the theater and noticed something very odd. People were getting out of their seats and donning their outer garments in total silence! Most of time at the end of the movie people react with chatter, or laughter, and even cheering on occasion. The film had burned its way into our senses to the point where everyone was emotionally drained.<br/><br/>I could use any number of superlatives to describe this movie from Amazing to Riveting and beyond, but the only thing I will say is; You have to see it for yourself! I promise you that you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>To all who had anything to do with the production of this film I say, Bravo! You can hold your head high and know you were part of something special."

","Every so often, a film comes along that somehow manages to worm its way into your heart, and then stays with you for years afterward. For this staunch atheist, that film inexplicably happened to be a Christ allegory, the poignant story of a miracle-man on death-row during the Great Depression. Director Frank Darabont, who impossibly followed up his debut 'The Shawshank Redemption (1994)' with something even better, is remarkable in his ability to evoke time and place, and to tell a story with a wistful nostalgia that incorporates the audience into its intimacy. Every character  even the minor supporting players  is perfectly drawn, as though we've known them our whole lives; now mere memories in the near-forgotten past. The 1935 setting emphasises the contrast between the general and widespread despair of the Depression, which had brought the entire developed world to its knees, with the arrival on death-row of John Coffey, an immense, mild-mannered African American with a special gift.<br/><br/>Like Darabont's previous film, 'The Green Mile (1999)' was adapted from an excellent story by horror icon Stephen King, this one originally released as a collection of novellas. Former prison-guard Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer) awakens from bad dreams to find himself in a nursing home that closely resembles the psychiatric ward in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975).' Paul seeks solitude in the vast green hills surrounding the home, but the demons of his past inevitably return to haunt him, and he breaks down in tears at the sight of Fred and Ginger dancing cheek-to-cheek in 'Top Hat (1935).' Slowly and painfully, Paul recounts the events that changed his life in 1935, when a gentle Black giant named John Coffey (""like the drink, only not spelt the same"") arrived on the lime-coloured tiles of the Green Mile to pay his due to society, for the vile murder of two young girls. For Paul (now played by Tom Hanks), everything he thinks he knows about life and God suddenly takes an unexpected, miraculous and even frightening turn.<br/><br/>It's one thing to have an ensemble of well-written characters, but the task of credibly communicating each personality ultimately comes down to the actors. Simply put, everybody in 'The Green Mile'  both the seasoned veterans and the emerging talents  delivers with a professionalism and sincerity rarely seen in today's big-budget pictures. Tom Hanks, as always, is strong in the lead role, possessing enough honest charm to make Edgecomb strong yet identifiable to the audience. Michael Clarke Duncan, in the role of his career, deservedly received an Oscar nomination for his role as John Coffey, a slow but earnest giant (probably inspired, in part, by John Steinbeck's Lennie Small) who, despite his sheer goodness, has become disillusioned by the corruption of our world. If Coffey is an allegory for Jesus Christ, then Sam Rockwell  as ""Wild Bill"" Wharton  is the film's representation of the Devil, a deranged youth whose only purpose in life is to wreak chaos on those around him. It's a telling sign that we frequently enjoy a chuckle at his mean-spirited (but admittedly creative) misdemeanours.<br/><br/>I want to dedicate a paragraph to Doug Hutchison as Percy Whetmore, simply because his supporting performance is one of the most extraordinary I've ever seen, and certainly among the most underrated in recent memory. Hutchison, an unknown actor  except to fans of 'The X-Files'  goes beyond being a straightforward villain, absolutely relishing the detestable guise of an erratic young prison guard with connections in high places. Smug, slimy and impulsive, Percy is a dangerous man to have around death-row, all the more so because he's as stupid as he is influential. Unlike Wild Bill, with whom the audience forms some sort of morbid connection, Percy is loathsome in every sense of the word, the only character since Nurse Ratched that I've genuinely want to wring about the neck. In his excellence, Hutchison is joined by an impeccable supporting cast, which is worth mentioning in its entirety: David Morse, Barry Pepper, Jeffrey DeMunn, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene, James Cromwell, Gary Sinise, Bonnie Hunt, Patricia Clarkson and, always a treat, Harry Dean Stanton.<br/><br/>King's original novel included a heartbreaking epilogue in which Paul watches his wife die in a road accident, as the immense black shadow of a recognisable man looms chillingly in the distance, an ominous reminder of Paul's sins. In the film, Darabont alludes only briefly to Jan's (Bonnie Hunt) death, but he strikes a similar note of melancholy as Paul reflects on the friends and family whom he has been forced to outlive as ""punishment"" for executing one of God's miracles. When Paul unaffectedly remarks to his audience, Elaine (Eve Brent), that she, too, will die in due course, the utter loneliness of his predicament truly hits home, and our fascination at his longevity is swiftly replaced with a gutting hollowness. Though Thomas Newman's score is suitably emotional, the most powerful moments are those accompanied by the nostalgic tunes of the era. The sheer blind optimism of ""Cheek to Cheek"" and ""Did You Ever See A Dream Walking?"" is heartbreaking when set against the hopelessness and despair of death-row and the Great Depression. Now I can't watch 'Top Hat' without getting a little teary."

","The Green Mile is a perfect and all round excellent film. The acting is simply damn good emotional, the direction is ecstatic and full of wonderful camera shots and a story that one could only admire with great belief and the fact remains that Darabont has produced a classic of epic scales and depths. The charisma and boldness of each touch to character and story is a perfect blend and shows a director at full working power. Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) delivers an outstanding performance that both uplifts as well as charms.<br/><br/>The story is set in non- chronological order which gives the depth of the film more purpose. The story follows a group of Death Row guards at a penitentiary, in the 1930's. Paul Edgecomb (Hanks) has watched men live and die on death row and so has shaken his faith and sanity. But when enters John Coffey (Clarke-Duncen) an 8 foot giant man accused of the murder and rape of two young girls Edgecomb befriends this giant man and begins to learn that he wasn't the one who committed the murder.<br/><br/>A mystical, powerful and deeply moving film that explodes with fantastic performances and one heck of a directorial masterwork proves Frank Darabont is one of the most exciting and provisional dramatic directors of all time. The Green Mile is film that'l have you laughing, crying and admiring."

","Very true story about human nature. We think when we hear all that Jesus suffered through out of love for others that we believe we would somehow be different than those that condemned him. We feel we would see him as the gift from god he was and we would stand at his side against the voices of others that did not understand.<br/><br/>John Coffey was a gift to this world but human nature, distrust, doubt and fear caused most of the characters in the film to miss out on him, to condemn him and ultimately put him to death. Here was a man filled with so much love for people that god had elevated him to be able to feel the pain of others,understand their pain enough to take it on within his body and ultimately release them from it by healing them. Most people today cannot think enough of their brothers and sisters to extend the common courtesies of respect to each other let alone so love others enough to heal. Most see so many reasons to condemn,fear and offer excuses not to understand as a result to experience such compassion for others would be impossible.<br/><br/>What if god did send amongst us those that were healers, those that could see beyond time and space those that could heal? Is it so impossible to think that truly loving souls, lights were given to this world? There is only one son of god, but surely god as a loving creator would send others throughout time just as was done in biblical days to bring light,love and that is part of the point of this film.""Miracles do happen."" John Coffey was a light. He was a good one and yet his actions were twisted by others to become something completely different than what they were in truth. Time and time again John's heart showed through and miracles came to life through him.Over and over again the characters in the film were shown he was different.<br/><br/>Great movie a must see and afterward try to take from it its lessons. Keep an open mind, open heart to see and maybe you might get lucky enough to see a miracle just like John Coffey."
"mr_popcorn","10","0","2","5 September 2008"," McCheesy's take on ""The Green Mile""
","Paul Edgecomb is a slightly cynical veteran prison guard on Death row in the 1930's. His faith, and sanity, deteriorated by watching men live and die, Edgecomb is about to have a complete turn around in attitude. Enter John Coffey, He's eight feet tall. He has hands the size of waffle irons. He's been accused of the murder of two children... and he's afraid to sleep in a cell without a night-light. And Edgecomb, as well as the other prison guards - Brutus, a sympathetic guard, and Percy, a stuck up, perverse, and violent person, are in for a strange experience that involves intelligent mice, brutal executions, and the revelation about Coffey's innocence and his true identity.<br/><br/>This one right here is a cinematic gem hands-down. Frank Darabont created such a sad sad story believe it or not folks, I cried like a leaked faucet. Such event occurs only on a blue moon so I guess this film holds a special place in my deep, dank heart. What made this film really stand out is that the director, Frank Darabont used contrasting plot elements and combined them seamlessly. In this case, the plot device of miracles and faith healing (during the Depression era in the States) which was perfectly embodied by Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, the Death Row inmate who possesses a special gift of faith healing. The other contrasting element is the backdrop of the story, a jailhouse wing managed by Tom Hank's character Paul Edgecomb. An unlikely situation in an unlikely place, a combination that worked within the film.<br/><br/>Excellent performances from Tom Hanks and surprisingly Michael Clarke Duncan. Why haven't we seen him in more dramatic roles like these? Kudos also to the rest of the cast, Barry Pepper, David Morse, Sam Rockwell and Doug Hutchison who by the way, have created a very thieving, mischievous, vile rat of a character. He definitely deserved his fate in the end.<br/><br/>The Green Mile is a gem."
"bobsgrock","8","0","1","21 August 2008"," A powerful tale with gripping performances.
","Frank Darabont delivers again with his second adaptation of a Stephen King novel based in a prison. And while this version isn't as powerful nor moving as that first one that is considered today to be a masterpiece of modern cinema, the same elements involved bring together a warm sense of beauty and moving storytelling. This time, the story is told through the eyes of the guards, most specifically Paul Edgecomb, the head guard the death row block known as the ""Green Mile."" One day, a huge black man comes to death row accused of raping and murdering two young girls. As time goes on, everyone on the Green Mile begins to realize that this man and the case he is involved with are not what they seem to be.<br/><br/>As with The Shawshank Redemption, the acting and writing are top-notch to give this film a great feel and powerful undertone. Tom Hanks is wonderful as Edgecomb, a man who has seen more than enough of death and sadness in his job but is forever changed when he encounters John Coffey. And it is this performance, by Michael Clarke Duncan, that sweeps you away and brings the most realism to the story. A humongous man with the spirit of a child, Duncan is completely believable and will move you to tears at some points. All other acting is phenomenal, including David Morse as Edgecomb's right-hand man, Barry Pepper as the young father who works there, Sam Rockwell as a very disturbing killer, and Michael Jeter as a lovable prisoner who gets the bitter end of his deal. And of course, Darabont delivers a great script with plenty of beautiful monologues that share the deep vision King's book does. The only weakness here is the obvious one; the running time being just over three hours. This is something very few films can pull off and this one doesn't. Still, for the most part it is moving and powerful and it boasts some of the finest performances you will ever see in a movie."

","The Green Mile, directed by Frank Darabont, is based on the story by Stephen King. It is set on Death Row and introduces us to many weird, but wonderful, characters. Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the main guard on the Green Mile (the ward has a green floor), who looks after the inmates that are awaiting execution. His workmates are lovable guards, all except one, Percy Wetmore, is a ruthless, vindictive man, who will stop at nothing to make himself seem more powerful. <br/><br/>The story is a flashback of Paul's life. Now in a retirement home, he begins to tell us his story; which doesn't really begin until a new inmate, John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), joins the people on the Green Mile.<br/><br/>He is a huge, giant black man, convicted of the murder of two little white girls, but he is not what he seems, like the fact he is scared of the dark and is very sensitive deep down inside. He also carries a supernatural ability, which is used to help the people that surround him. Coffey, ""like the drink, only not spelled the same,"" is a simpleminded, illiterate man who causes no trouble, but is found crying, with the girl's bodies in his hands and the question of whether he committed the crime, stays in your mind until the concluding part of the film, when the characters finally find out the truth.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, there are scenes of powerful emotion, one where Del Delacroix (Michael Jeter) is told that his pet mouse, Mr Jingles, won't be going to mousy heaven because there isn't one and the final scene for John Coffey, which is a definite tear jerker, so get the tissues out. However, there are scenes that have strong horror, like one scene shows the audience the horrific consequence if water is not added to the prisoner's head, before the electric execution, therefore this movie is not for sensitive souls and it is one of the reasons that it is rated 18. Other moments of great impact include the relationship between one man, Del, and his mouse, Mr Jingles and the subplots involving the wives of Paul (Bonnie Hunt) and the warden (Patricia Clarkson). <br/><br/>The centre of the movie, is based around the relationship of Edgecomb and Coffey and how Coffey can help things that are suffering, ""I just took it back, is all"" and his ability takes the story right to the end of the film when he frees himself of other people's pain and hands it to Paul. <br/><br/>When watching the film, it reminded me a lot of the story ""Of mice and men"" by John Steinbeck. Both tales were set in the Depression era when men were finding it hard to find work and black people were being discriminated against. John Coffey is much like the character Lennie, Paul like George and Percy is like Curley. Also, in 'Of Mice and Men' Lennie is blamed for murdering the mice, puppy and Curley's wife, and in The Green Mile, Coffey is blamed for the murder of the two girls. <br/><br/>The acting is extremely good, Michael Clarke Duncan's character is created in such a way that everyone is hoping that there will be a happy ending in store for him and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Whilst, Tom Hanks' character is more of a responsible person that you really get to know how he is feeling and he wins the audience's sympathy. Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) is a character that you love to hate and Mr Jingles, the mouse, is the star of the show.<br/><br/>The music in the film has perfect timing, which makes it more of an emotional ride and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound (Robert J. Litt, Elliot Tyson, Michael Herbick and Willie D. Burton) and for an Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Film, USA Award, for Best Music (Thomas Newman). <br/><br/>Overall, the movie is fantastic; it is a gripping tale that will keep you intrigued until the very last moment. The acting and music turns the film into something quite magical and it has scenes that range from being so intense that you feel as if you were there, to moments where you wish you had bought some more tissues. However, the only thing that spoils the film is the length of it, a whopping three hours and eight minutes makes the tale seem that it is dragging on a little too much."

","Yes, it has been at least seven years since I saw this film, long before I even had access to my own computer, so this review is a bit late (but better late than never!) As stated in the summary, The Green Mile is a brilliant film directed by Frank Darabont, of Shawshank Redemption fame. Set in 1935 Mississippi (namely the Green Mile, a play on the term Last Mile because of the fact that the floor is the colour of ""tired old limes"") The Green Mile tells the story of head prison guard Paul Edgecombe and his life as ""bull goose screw"" of the Mile. The movie (which is EXTREMELY accurate to Stephen King's novel except for a few minor details)is narrated by a VERY elderly Paul, who is writing his memoirs of his time on the Mile. From the early days on the mile, to the arrivals of the delightful (despite the terrible crimes he committed) Eduard Delacroix, out of control William ""Wild Bill Wharton"" and the central character, the mysterious John Coffey, and a tiny mouse named Mr. Jingles, the viewer sees it all, and is actually taken on a trip back in time to the dank cell block which houses these condemned men and the notorious Old Sparkey (no need to explain what that is).<br/><br/>The acting in this film is superb, from Tom Hanks as Edgecombe (though Hanks never disappoints in my personal opinion) to Doug Hutchinson, who plays the arrogant, foolish and very detestable Percy Wetmore. When watching Hutchinson, one can just see meanness oozing from his pores. The piece de resistance, however, is the performance of Michael Clark Duncan, who plays Coffey. Duncan is absolutely brilliant, showing (as one person had previously commented) how a man of such size can be a helpless, lost, almost catatonic figure who can at times light up like an innocent child at certain times in the movie (I won't go any further than that in case there are still a few people who have not yet seen this film).<br/><br/>The directing is also well done, from the shots of scenic Georgia Pines Nursing Home to the dank, chilling cell block where most of the story takes place, Darabont takes you on a journey through time, just as Paul does in the memoirs he is penning. My verdict? One of the best films in a long time, my favorite Stephen King adaptation (the book was also my favorite by King) and definitely worth watching even eight or nine years after it was released. How this movie was snubbed at the Oscars that year I will never fully understand (especially the Best Supporting Actor nod for Michael Clark Duncan). An easy ten."

You may also wonder if he could ever make another film as great as Redemption.<br/><br/>But he has. In fact, I found The Green Mile to be better than Shawshank. I often find it hard to enjoy a long film, as they tend to drag in parts. The Green Mile never drags, and never gets boring. The story moves forward at a suitable pace, and never ceases to entertain.<br/><br/>The acting was fantastic, with Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell and (especially) David Morse, whose performances were all amazing. Tom Hanks is excellent as usual, but far and away the very best performance was that of Michael Clarke Duncan, who was nominated for an Oscar for his role as an allegedly dangerous, yet unusually sensitive and seemingly good natured man.<br/><br/>Altogether, The Green Mile is, in my opinion, nothing short of a masterpiece. One of the best movies I've ever seen. 9.8/10"
"drmality-1","9","0","1","23 December 2007"," We all have our own Green Mile...
","This is one of the rare modern films that feels really timeless. A better example of ensemble acting couldn't be found...just about everyone excels in their roles here. But I would like to put in a special word for Dabbs Greer, who did an outstanding job of portraying the older version of Paul Edgecomb. This man was a fixture in early TV and popped up in many B- movies over the years. No matter what the role or the movie, he always did well and never seemed to get the break he deserved. In ""The Green Mile"", and the twilight of his years, he delivered an outstanding performance as the good-hearted prison guard who is cursed with too much life and too much knowledge. Terrific actor.<br/><br/>And so are the rest. Hanks is great as young Paul Edgecomb and brings restrained humor and warm humanity to his part. Also good is underrated David Morse as ""Brutal"", a mis- named prison guard who is a rock of stability. On the opposite end of likability is the detestable Percy Wetmore, one of the most obnoxious characters I've ever seen in a movie, brought to life by Doug Hutchinson, who needs kudos for tackling such a difficult role.<br/><br/>Everybody seems to get their own thread to add to this tapestry: Graham Greene, whose brief soliloquy before his death is nonetheless moving; James Cromwell as the prison warden who's wife is dying horribly until John Coffey intervenes; Michael Jeter, as the death row inmate who becomes the protector of Mr. Jingles; Patricia Clarkson, as the warden's wife who is saved by John Coffey.<br/><br/>The only slightly false note I thought came from Sam Rockwell's portrayal of Wild Bill, which is so over the top that he seemed more foolish than frightening.<br/><br/>Of course, the performance that drew the most publicity in ""The Green Mile"" belonged to huge Michael Clarke Duncan as the simple-minded miracle man John Coffey (note the initials J.C.). Duncan not only projects child-like innocence and a good heart, but the incredible suffering of a man who feels the pain of all the world. ""It's like pieces of glass sticking in my head,"" he moans to Edgecomb, practically begging to be put to death. It would be a pretty hard heart that wouldn't shed a tear during the final execution scene.<br/><br/>A terrific movie, a fable for the modern day, that sucks you in and doesn't let go. There aren't many like this any more."

","I have watched this movie two days ago. I usually don't cry for sad movies, but The Green Mile made me drop so much tears. Even though it's unbelievable for some scenes, but the point of movie is shown very clearly like the sunshine. I had watched sad movies that everyone told me that they cried for them, but I didn't. I just did it for The Green Mile. I really love Duncan's acting. He's really gorgeous!! He could act out of his character very well done. This movie shows me that they are some unfairness in this world. For example, the racism to the colored people. I was despised when I was in the U.S. by some people who thought that they were the greatest kind of people in the world. However, they were many people who helped me a lot and were nice to me. I really want this movie to be shown in everywhere which still has racism. God gave the same shadow to the rich and poor. To the white and colored, to everyone with love. Although I am not Christian, but I really understand this feeling. I hope this movie can teach us in some ways. I proudly voted this movie at 10. Really Love it!!!!"
"Otoboke","8","0","2","22 October 2007"," Touching Drama
","The Green Mile is a very touching film that creates memorable characters and takes care of them throughout its life, never neglecting nor smothering them. Darabront does well to bring all these characters into the big screen whilst balancing them perfectly with wonderful side stories along the way. Of course, Stephen King is the creative force behind the plot, and he does well here, delivering a story that is both captivating and mesmerising to watch.<br/><br/>Performances from the cast are all exceptional and I mean all. Tom Hanks has always been a favourite actor of mines as his warmth and real sense of humanity always connect with me and pull me in to his characters. With the Green Mile, Hanks does a wonderful job yet again. Duncan and Jeter also caught my eye quite a lot, portraying their sympathetic characters with complete accuracy.<br/><br/>David Tattersall also does what he does best by delivering wonderful cinematography that is simple yet undeniably interesting to look at from beginning to end. Overall, I loved this film and was in tears by the end. Definitely recommended to anyone and everyone."

","I don't know how to explain how good this movie really is. I'm not going to write a hundred lines, just enough so others can see and be encouraged to watch this remarkable film.<br/><br/>It's about the lives of a couple of guards on death row, until the day a wrongly accused man, John Coffey(beautifully played by Michael Clarke Duncan, who I think deserved an Oscar..), walks in the room. Tom Hanks was good as the religious man who wants to save Coffey from the electric chair, but then doesn't cause he told him not to.<br/><br/>The scene where he watched a film for the first time was... amazing. So powerful, touching and I felt something that I've never felt for a movie before. When I find out what it was i'll let you know.<br/><br/>Morse, Hunt, Cromwell, Jeter, Rockwell, Pepper, Stanton, Clarkson and Hutchison were all good as the good/bad/sad characters in this film. Really, it's a flawless film.<br/><br/>I cried a lot during this film! The greatest film ever to be created. Good job King and Darabont.<br/><br/>I hope my comment was useful. Thanks."

"icfarm","10","0","2","25 September 2007"," King plus Darabont equals Match Made In Heaven.
","As great a writer as Stephen King is, film adaptations of his work tend to be hit-or-miss. I've noticed it's the non-horrific works (Stand By Me, Shawshank, Dolores Claiborne and this)that seem to work the best. I would say ""horror"" King films that are up to the same standard as the films I mentioned just now are rare, but I would certainly put ""Misery"" in their league.<br/><br/>Anyhow, this is an absolutely brilliant adaptation of the ""serial"" novel (published in installments) that King wrote. While not a ""horror"" movie, it does contain one element of the fantastic - John Coffey's healing ability - that is handled as realistically as could be expected. Darabont's script is spot-on. Tom Hanks has never, in the films I've seen him in, given a less than great performance, and this is no exception. And the supporting cast? Try David Morse, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter(RIP), Barry Pepper, Doug Hutchison, and of course, Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey. Then there's the crazy Sam Rockwell and the beautiful and talented Bonnie Hunt and Patricia Clarkson. All brilliant. A note on Mr. Hutchison's performance as Percy Whetmore: When I first saw this film, after the scene of Del's (Michael Jeter) horrific (due to Percy's sabotage) execution, when Percy sulkily mutters, ""I didn't know the sponge was supposed to be wet"", I actually spoke out loud to the screen - ""Like h--l you didn't"". That is how much I was drawn in by his performance and made to loathe his character.<br/><br/>Anyway, on to the plot. John Coffey (Duncan, in his Oscar-nominated performance)is found holding two tiny, dead girls in his arms and crying hysterically. The only words he can get out are, ""I tried to take it back, but it was too late"". This circumstantial evidence, on top of the fact that he is black (given the times the story is set in) leads to his quick conviction and sentencing to death. He arrives on the ""Green Mile"", so called for its green tiled floor, E-Block. This is Death Row circa 1930's Louisiana, and it is presided by senior guard Paul Sheldon (Hanks) and other guards (Morse, Pepper, Hutchison and Jeffrey DeMunn, who I'm afraid I neglected to mention earlier)who serve under his command. Coffey is escorted onto the Mile by conceited, self-centered guard Percy Whetmore (Hutchison) accompanied by Percy's cries of ""Dead man walking"". We soon learn that Coffey is a gentle, childlike, mentally challenged giant. He is afraid of the dark and, although he could probably snap any one of the guards like a twig if he ever so chose, he does not choose to do so.<br/><br/>The ensuing plot twists and healings are brilliantly portrayed. This is, perhaps, the best of all King film adaptations. Highly recommended. Cheers."

","After Frank Darabonts debut with Shaw Shank Redemption who thought he could come up with another miracle. None the less here it is a movie I could say is a good merge of Shaw Shank Redemption and The Big Fish. Entirely entertaining and based on Stephen Kings novel the story and acting keep you glued to the couch threw out the entire film. The dialog was nothing short of excellent and the pace of the story was a perfect choice for the big screen.<br/><br/>There are a few flaws in the film one I would have to say the part when John transfered the insects to Percy whom then let them go into the E cell block. Now this wouldn't have been all that repetitive had the insects not been transfered over into John in the first place. Not that its Frank Darabont I am fairly sure he took it from the novel but on a novel standpoint I think the insects weren't even necessary to convey the image it was good enough with all the miracles already.<br/><br/>The use of the insects is similar to Magnolias use of raining frogs both which can be lived without within our beloved film industry. I do admit Magnolias raining frogs had been rather awkward to the point of interest but a little far fetched and unexpected. Some people may be looking exactly for that not me however I prefer the tea spoon of fantasy in my modern day scenario based fantasies unless it has to do with masked super-heros. Only place such extreme fantasy belongs in is full fledged fantasy like Lord of the Rings or Star Wars.<br/><br/>Enough of the argument though I was rather harsh on picking on this movie for such a minor thing. The movie itself was spectacular, Tom Hanks was spectacular the entire cast was spectacular. The story never slowed down and all connected very well. There are rarely movies of this caliber in Hollywood but Tom Hanks never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>In the end the little mouse will achieve a nice place in our hearts even after the miles of film that we have seen."
"amyhung3137","9","0","2","16 June 2007"," An AWESOME Movie---The Green Mile
","An oldster was watching an old film, as the main character,Fred Astaire,sang the song---Cheek to Cheek, he was disaggregated. With his friend, he slowly told of a story happened in 1935, when he was still a jailer...... Stephen King was known for his horror novels, and they have been turned into movies for numerous time. However, those which are the most famous ones, are not horror novels, such as The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile which were directed by Frank Darabont. Not the same as The Shawshank which he made a conte into a two and a half ours movie, this time, he made a thick,thick novel into a three hours movie! As I started watching this film, I was pulled into the story. This was the first time to see Stephen King's movie, and it didn't disappoint me. Although it's a tragedy, as it seems like; I think it presents another kind of happy ending. The background was at the Cold Mountain Gaol in south United State. It's a friendship between Paul Edgecomb, a jailer of condemned cell; and John Coffey, a strapping,condemned dinge. It's really amazing that two people with this kind of wired relationship can be friends. Cause Paul disbelieved a person who was scared of dark and liked playing with mice can kill anyone. In my opinion, put aside the miraculous power of John, the part of talking about the bright and dark side of human nature is much more important. We know too less about ourselves---human beings. As everybody says. there's an angel and a devil in our mind. People's willpower is infirm, we're feeble minded, and we usually don't know. The idea of ""being"" and ""death"" carry this movie, and it's also the most touching part. Before John died, he turned his power to Paul. The power made him to lived long, to hear people in the world being grievous, and saw people around died consecutively. At the end of Pual's life was in the bead house, was he pleased to have this power? We don't know, but at lease, he learns a lot."

","Mel produced THE PASSION and was hated by many in may quarters for it; King wrote the same story to general acclaim.<br/><br/>Green Mile is narrated by Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) recalling his days as a prison guard on death row escorting the condemned down the last mile. in Edgecomb's facility this is called the Green Mile. there are three prisoners awaiting the hot seat, a psychotic killer who delights in impish, sadistic maliciousness as he weaves in and out of catatonia, the confused Cajun and John Coffey. Coffey is a convicted killer with extraordinary powers complimented by childlike gentleness, despite his imposing size and physical strength. He is described by his captors as a wonder of nature and a gift of God.<br/><br/>Though impressed with Coffey's demonstrated talents, Edgecomb and the crew decide that Coffey must walk the mile, simply because they can't figure out anything else to do with him. Coffey is too childlike to escape.<br/><br/>The movie version of Green Mile though it attains near perfection in story telling, fails to grasp only one aspect of the King novel on which it is based: the erratic and occasionally contradictory flow of Edgecomb's (played in twilight years by Dabbs Greer) recollection. The movie ends on a more positive note than the book and avoids King's speculation on re-incarnation."

And a special mention to the genius of Stephen King on whose stories both movies are based. I will never forget either one of them.

"possumopossum","9","0","2","1 March 2007"," Mr. Jingles Kicks Butt!!!
","Not many movies do Stephen King's novels justice, but this one was a pleasant surprise. John Coffey is the gentle giant falsely accused of raping and murdering two young girls in depression era Louisiana (Mississippi in the book)and is awaiting execution on death row, known as the green mile because the walk to the electric chair is over a green floor. Tom Hanks plays as the death row warden Paul Edgecomb who takes on a Pontius Pilate roll when he is made to realize that John is innocent of this heinous crime. One weeps as John is led to his execution at the end of the movie, but one also feels relief for him because, as he told Paul, he wanted it to be over. ""I'm tired, boss. Dead tired,"" he repeats throughout the movie, and it sounds almost like the refrain of a folk ballad. ""I'm tired of people being ugly to each other."" John had a gift of healing but also the curse of feeling others' pain, and it was this that he wanted to be released from.<br/><br/>Mr. Jingles was an entertaining balance to the grisly scenes in the execution chamber, and John heals him after a mean-spirited guard stepped on him and broke every bone in his body. (What was with Percy anyway? The guy went postal over seeing a mouse, and I don't think the book even explains this very well.) Incidentally, wasn't that Mr. Jingles I also saw in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION as Andy Dufresne was being led down ""the hole"" into solitary confinement? I wonder...<br/><br/>Great movie. Surprisingly gentle for a Stephen King story. 9 out of 10."

","I had forgotten this was a Stephen King story, probably because it's basis in the supernatural doesn't delve into the realm of horror. The terror here is provided not by a demonic clown or a shop keeper from hell, instead it has a human face. In fact a couple of human faces, in the form of sadistic killer 'Wild Bill' Wharton (Sam Rockwell) and corrupt prison guard Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison). Their characterizations are just a few of the excellent portrayals in a film that leave one with mixed emotions and perhaps a misty eye or two.<br/><br/>Michael Clarke Duncan casts a large shadow as accused killer John Coffey; his introductory walk on the 'green mile' has a numbing influence on prisoners and guards alike. For an actor who virtually came from nowhere, his performance is extraordinary, shaded with subtle nuance and deep emotion. His characterization is deftly complemented by the core guard group headed by Tom Hanks' Paul Edgecombe, and includes David Morse, Barry Pepper and Jeffrey DeMunn.<br/><br/>Speaking for myself, the film's run time of just over three hours is hardly noticed, it's that gripping and absorbing. It puts the viewer through an entire range of emotions; the scenes that develop the duplicitous nature of guard Percy are particularly unnerving. Wouldn't it have been interesting to throw Percy and Wild Bill in a cell together for a mid film half time show?<br/><br/>Once one realizes that Coffey will ultimately walk his last mile on death row, the mind races with thoughts of how he'll be found innocent and exonerated of the murder of the two young farm girls. Coffey's own thoughts on the matter only partly put the viewer at ease, there still remains the sense that justice demands an entirely different outcome. Coffey's execution is powerfully emotional, and calls to mind the finale of ""Angels With Dirty Faces"", when the execution of Cagney's character elicits the same misty eyed response. I include both films on my list of all time favorites, each a classic in it's own way."

I watched it again today with my wife because it came on FX and I was too lazy to get up and change the channel. All I have to say is what a movie. The story is about a gang of prison guards who work on death row in a prison down south, They do the best they can to make the condemned mens lives a little bit better for their final days. That is if the convict is not a complete animal without remorse. Enter Mr. Duncan playing a dimwitted muscular African American accused of murdering and raping two little girls. At first I thought maybe this character is slightly offensive? But his lovable nature and antique soul helped me see beyond that. He is truly a beautiful man, an angel perhaps who has the ability to heal the sick. As the film goes on you learn that he was actually trying to heal the little girls. Anyway let's just say a black man in the south in the nineteen thirties did not stand much a chance of being found innocent of anything even if he was Jesus Christ himself reborn. I shed tears on several occasions to the point where my pregnant, over emotional wife was comforting me. I do give this film my seal of approval for what its worth."

","This particular movie directed by Frank Darabont brought great emotion and unusual drama to its audience. To best describe most of the movie,I would say that looks can be deceiving and to not judge people for their outer appearance, but for who they are at heart. For example, John Coffey was considered to have committed a crime, and due to his appearance people judged him and labeled him a killer. Yet, he was innocent and a kind man. This movie explains our reality as well, because some people are going to prison for something they did not commit. Green Mile was captivating and educational, demonstrating how we should treat and respect one another. Unfortunately in life you come upon individuals who have not learned the lesson that we are equal as human beings."

The story revolves around a prison guard on death row where prisoners wait to be executed. Normal work for Paul Edgecomb that is, until John Coffey, a large black man convicted of raping and murdering twin girls, enters the cell block. A beautiful book, a wonderful film and a director who literally takes the characters out of the pages and puts them on screen, it becomes an incredible mix of drama, fantasy and mystery.

However, after watching this movie, there is nothing negative to say. The characters were portrayed well, Hanks gave a stellar performance, Duncan was magnificent and the movie in itself is a work of art.

"ShootingShark","7","0","1","19 November 2006"," Haunting Tale Of Beauty And Cruelty On Death Row
","Paul Edgecomb is the head guard on death row in a Tennessee prison in 1935. His latest charge is John Coffey, a simple-minded giant who seems to have a unique ability to heal. As he gets to know Coffey, Paul becomes convinced he is an innocent man. How can he supervise the execution of a saint ?<br/><br/>Based on a great book by Stephen King, this is a wonderful tale of innocence, corruption and faith in the bleakest of settings. What makes the story so touching is the realness and humanity of the characters, despite the fantastical elements and the extreme situation. Paul and Brutal are heroic, Percy is loathsome, Billy is an obscenity and John is angelic, yet all of their actions resonate and they never seem far-fetched or hokey. These five performances - Hanks, Morse, Hutchison, Rockwell and Duncan - are crucial to the suspension of disbelief and are all superb, and all are note-perfect. Duncan in particular is astonishing in his depth and sensitivity; as his initials suggest, he is Jesus - healing the sick, shouldering an impossible burden and dying for the sins of others. The great cast also features fine supporting performances from Cromwell, Clarkson, Sadler, Sinise and Greer as the Ancient Mariner who recounts the tale in the prologue and epilogue. Darabont has carefully adapted the novel (originally published in old-fashioned serial form) to squeeze all the emotion out of the story, and many scenes pack an incredible wallop; the three electrocutions are almost unwatchable, not because they're overtly violent, but because the movie has made us get to know the victims far too well. I'm not sure if I have any real criticisms of this film, but it doesn't touch me as deeply as I want it to. Perhaps that's because the material is very dark (John sums it up when he says, ""I'm tired of people being ugly to each other Â… it's like pieces of glass in my head all the time.""), or that it invites comparison with Darabont's earlier King adaptation, The Shawshank Redemption, which I'd rate as one of the ten best movies of the nineties. Technically, it's beautifully made. It is a long film (188 minutes) given the scope of the story, and languidly paced, but correctly so to build the characterisation. It's still a must-see though. And - sorry to do this - Duncan is really six-feet-five, only one inch taller than Morse (Brutal) and two inches shorter than Cromwell (the Warden). That's the magic of the movies !!"

This movie is worth watching and a collection item. Tom Hanks did one of his best performances ever. I recommend this movie to anyone. All the characters were great!

","I think Frank Darabont loves Stephen King. That's not a bad thing though. He's made Shawshank and this cracking film, and well they are amazing.<br/><br/>He creates a harrowing, dark yet at the same time a rather sweet little film and I think it's all nice.<br/><br/>The story, well a guy with basically the hands of god is accused of murdering two young girls and set on death row. Throughout his time in the clink he forms close bonds with a number of the prison workers and demonstrates his amazing power to them. With a few other screwballs on the green mile, notably Billy the Kid who is the worst of the bunch.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays the main warden who takes the guy, John Coffey (A brilliant Michael Clarke Duncan) by his word and attempts to find out more about the giant man's healing ability.<br/><br/>By the end you get to know that it wasn't Johnkilling the girls, but more over he was trying to cure them. But they had gone. The heart-shattering performance is what gives the film the edge, and it's final execution scene by the wardens, even though they know in their hearts that John is innocent, yet they cannot prove it makes them weep. And it is this, the dramatic climax that gets you to appreciate the force of this thoroughly imaginative film. I salute it, it is amazing.<br/><br/>Although, not as good as the book, still damn worthy of praise..."
"cchase","10","0","2","10 October 2006"," A Film That Is Itself A ""Miracle""...
","Here we are, seven years after the release of THE GREEN MILE, and it still retains all of its power and wonder. ""Modern classic"" is a term that gets bandied about far too loosely these days, but if there's at least one film from the last decade or so that solidly qualifies for that accolade, this is it.<br/><br/>Both a personal memoir and a provocative story about injustice, suffering, and the depths of both depravity and compassion that can be found in the recesses of the human heart, it is the story of Paul Edgecomb, (a nearly perfect Tom Hanks), and his stint as the head prison guard, running the section of Death Row known as ""The Green Mile,"" in a penitentiary, circa the 1930's. Suffering from a severe infection that year, Paul is badly in need of a miracle when the most amazing one of all comes into his life, and the lives of the men who live - and die - on the 'Mile.' His name is John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a gentle giant of an inmate charged with the brutal rape and murder of two little girls. The meek and passive demeanor of this man hardly seems a match for the horrible acts he's been charged with, but that's not even half the story. A spellbinding and escalating series of events take place involving John that not only changes Paul's life, but indicates that there are forces greater than ourselves that exist in the universe, and that miracles can only happen when we finally believe in them.<br/><br/>Tales like THE GREEN MILE are the reason why I became a movie lover in the first place, and if writer/director Frank Darabont deserved every award nod he received for his take on another Stephen King story, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, he should have won every single award for this one.<br/><br/>And not a discouraging word can be said about this cast. Not a single actor has done work this remarkable since, but then this script and story are one of those things that comes along but once in a lifetime.<br/><br/>Be prepared to be entertained, mesmerized and moved beyond anything you might expect from a three-hour film that makes time seem immaterial. And bring plenty of Kleenex, regardless of your gender, for one of the most unforgettable endings ever.<br/><br/>I am more than happy to give this film IMDb's highest rating, and my highest recommendation."

","Cinematic masterpiece that leaves you with lingering images, as well as thinking about it for days after seeing it. An excellent work.<br/><br/>The story is told as a period piece, but has elements of a fable as well. It's an intelligent script, rich in symbolism, an involving story with several elements, deep and well developed characters, expert directing of a fine ensemble cast; the film features everything that makes for a great movie.<br/><br/>Versatile Tom Hanks (as a death row prison guard) is terrific, as usual. However, the entire cast in this film are outstanding; particularly Michael Clarke Duncan who is riveting as a (wrongly convicted and) condemned gentle giant named John Coffey, with an equally giant heart, and an empathic gift of healing. This seemingly simple man quickly develops into a complex, sympathetic innocent whose suffering you soon feel with him. The special effects depicting Coffey absorbing a victim's illness/injury are at once grotesque and frightening, while wondrous in the context of their healing properties.<br/><br/>Other cast members are noteworthy, as well. Doug Hutchison, as a deranged and sadistic guard evokes the intended amount of anger and disgust. But he's not just a caricature, his sick persona is well developed as a contrast to the positive personalities in the film. Sam Rockwell as ""Wild Bill"" is properly ugly in his psychotic ways. David Morse, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt; so many actors did a good job; it's just not possible to name them all. Characters are all developed, and you are involved with their ultimate fates in the story, even that of a stray mouse that becomes a playful pet.<br/><br/>One scene, featuring Coffey and the warden's ill wife (Patricia Clarkson), is one of the many a highlights of the film. The dialog and action in this wonderful scene are immensely powerful in their gentle simplicity.<br/><br/>The film mixes very brutal realities with metaphysical fantasy, and blends them with astonishing success. This film is outstanding, and worthy of the time you spend to watch it, and the time you'll spend, thinking about it afterward."

"abum190","8","0","1","17 September 2006"," A profoundly moving movie
","I found myself nearly moved to tears by this film and its characters. The story is wonderful and the movie is cast so well, you can almost forgive the moments where it doesn't feel quite real.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb, who is the highest-ranking guard at death row. The movie begins with a new prisoner (Michael Clarke Duncan) arriving at the Green Mile as they call it, so named after the green floor. This new prisoner changes everyone in the prison- criminals and guards alike.<br/><br/>The performances very nearly make the movie. Tom Hanks doesn't have an incredible amount of acting to do (Duncan and Jeter take the main honors in this movie), but as usual he is so honest and real I had no trouble believing him, no matter how outrageous any choices his character makes might seem. I also liked David Morse as Brutal, Edgecomb's second-in-command and good friend. Neither actor is able to steal the scene away from the prisoners though; and I don't think they really try to. If they did, it would have thrown the movie off-balance. Michael Clarke Duncan plays a simple character but he invests him with such passion and honesty that he comes off as real and unreal at the same time- the perfect combination for a movie about the unexplainable. He is perfect as Coffey, and without such a good performance in this role, the movie would have been mediocre. Michael Jeter is also very good and sympathetic in his role as the French prisoner. Doug Hutchison is appropriately sleazy in his role and Sam Rockwell appropriately crazy in his. The way these performances fit together is amazing to watch.<br/><br/>Besides the cast, the story is superb. It balances the real and supernatural so well, the supernatural seems to fit perfectly into this world. The movie also wisely does not explain the phenomena- sometimes there are things we just can't explain. I won't ruin exactly what happens, but I will say this: the movie was telling its story well before anything supernatural happened, but when it does happen it feels right, and you know you're dealing with a movie that has all the trappings of achieving greatness.<br/><br/>However there are certain scenes that feel awkward to me. The scene where Paul invites the other guards to dinner and then forces them to decide what to do seemed contrived to me, as did the entire prologue to the movie. Even so, I really liked the movie and the epilogue is so satisfying and it completes the movie so well, I'm willing to put those scenes aside and wholeheartedly recommend this movie. It's quite a story, and deserves to be heard by anyone who loves movies."

The direction, writing and acting are all 5-star. Duncan's performance is one of those that many people have compared to that of Jesus Christ. I'm not a religious person, but I'm going to agree with my previous sentence I just wrote. He is God in this movie. It's what he does, he ""helps it, is all."" He only uses it to help...never to hurt. What was very surprising is that Hanks did not receive an Oscar nomination for his performance. The best scenes were with Duncan and Hanks. Although, the film had so many wonderful scenes. I still cry at the ending.

","Mr. Edgecomp is the keeper in the green mile, the prison for the people that are condemned to death. One day arrives a new killer: John Coffey, who has raped and murdered two little girls. Even at the first moment, he notices something weird in Coffey, he seems nothing but a murder and strange things began to happen there, which make us realize that there's hope for miracles, even in that place. In this movie, the acting is superb, with one nomination to ""bear"" Coffey, absolutely deserved, and a Tom hanks in his greats moments. The plot is very interesting and catches you from the beginning, and keeps you wondering what is going to happen at every moment. The movie throws you deep in the magical world of Stephen King, where, almost everything is possible and the atmosphere is, also, perfectly done. A great film that maybe is too long, when the ending is to arrive, the rhythm stops totally and makes the las half an hour a little boring; with a better work there, possibly it would have reached the ten. to sum up, a great hard film, with great story and great acting and a great amount of touching moments.

"avinashnow","7","0","1","19 May 2006"," For some , the Green Mile is just very long
","Great movie, Superb Performances, but leaves a lot desired in terms of the Shawshank effect. My opinions are not prejudiced because Tom Hanks happens to be my favorite actor for the past decade and a half plus but what he does with his acting is create a performance which makes me sit back and say "" Oh Boy, all what shades can he portray"". For e.g in one particular scene when he is showing the pains of urine infection, he makes it look nothing less than real itself. Coz some point of time, guess I had urine infection too and I know what is it. He is so real that he actually makes you believe that he is not Tom Hanks but Paul Edgecomb. The other good acts are by David ""Brutal"" Morse and who else but John Coffey who does give a stellar performance in front of a legend like Tom.<br/><br/>The movie certainly deserved to be nominated for the best picture as it had an overall impact of a good team performance.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont does an amazing job with the direction, guess but his magnum opus till date has been Shawshank Redemption. I guess when I compare both of them, what I find missing in ""The Green Mile"" is the sense of conviction in the story itself. Whereas in Shawshank we believe that something like that can happen to people, we think the miracles as shown in The Green Mile are definitely not possible. But then , Paul Edgecomb himself did not believe in them, didn't he.<br/><br/>All in all, the pace of the movie may be slow, but it just holds you like a vice and never lets you go. Good humor and some stirring scenes add to the pace if it gets slow somewhere. I guess, the way the music in Shawshank uplifted our spirits, is not the same with The Green Mile, where the background music leaves a lot to be desired."
"RT Firefly","Null","0","1","11 May 2006"," Partonizing and overwrought, but still a must see.
","There are several things that bothered me about this film and I will get into that in a second, but first I must say The Green Mile has some of the best acting you will ever see in a movie. Tom Hanks has a special ability to make nothing seem like something. I often wonder if even HE knows what he's doing. You don't really notice it while he's doing it, but after the film find yourself feeling like you know the guy. Unlike being shocked by the sheer magnetism of a Marlin Brando, or the energy of Robert DeNiro, Hanks wins you over by appearing NOT to act. It's like you're watching a video of yourself going through what he is doing. Like you have lived it. Another special treat is gentle giant Michael Clarke Duncan playing the healer John Coffey. Such tenderness and control while holding back a flood of emotion, all without slipping into bathos is a rare thing indeed. Duncan should have won an academy award. A mesmerizing performance. Michael Jeter also turns in a fine performance as the Cajun convict Eduard Delacroix. Bonnie Hunt was doing such a good job I didn't even recognize her at first. The rest of the cast is all well chosen. Excellent performances all around.<br/><br/>My criticisms of the film are brief. I only mention them because were it not for these simple faults, I feel The Green Mile has a shot at the ""greatest film of all time"" title, and yes, I know that's saying a lot.<br/><br/>1) The movie was too long. There comes a time when you need to pick a storyline from the book and then throw the book out. Everything this film said and did could have easily been done in 2 hours and it would have had more impact. It also would have left the audience wanting more, like Apocalypse Now, vs. A.N. Redux.<br/><br/>2) I found the foul language and adult situations to be distracting from the topic and genre. A more traditional approach here would have made for a more timeless and accessible work. The language was too ""on the head"" (see point 4) 3) I didn't like the special effect of how John Coffey heals. It was too... Steven Kingish? A more subtle approach would have been more thought provoking, which leads me to my last point...<br/><br/>4) The movie frequently tries too hard. It has 17 endings, like with Shawshank, it has endless underscoring of its messages and points, it rambles, it over-explains, it hits the nail on the head -- twice, just in case you missed the first one. It would take pages to explain this point in detail, so suffice to say, if you agree, you know what I am talking about, and if you disagree, you will love this film all the more.<br/><br/>I know this is sacrilege to filmmakers and impossible, but I would love to see a highly edited version of this film. Take out the healing effects. Cut the modern day beginning and ending off. Remove the language (it's a cruel world, okay okay, I get it), cut massive amounts of build up and redundancies. Let us just watch those incredible performances tell this beautiful story and most of all, let us think. We are not all that stupid, Frankly."

","There comes a time once every few years when you see a movie which is so good it overtakes everything else that you have ever seen before. The Green Mile overtook every single movie that I have ever watched, it left Braveheart years behind the moment I watched, Braveheart was my previous favourite movie.<br/><br/>There comes a time in one's life when they you are left aghast, speechless and perhaps overwhelmed by a movie that you have watched. I was left heartbroken, overwhelmed and flabbergasted after watching The Green Mile.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is talented actor, of that there is no question, we all know he can produce some very good performances in every movie he takes on, but we should acknowledge his ability to choose the better movies to act in, I have yet to see an awful movie which Hanks has participated in, they are all either OK, good or brilliant movies. Hanks doesn't disappoint us in The Green Mile, it is one of his 3 best performances for sure, in my opinion it comes slightly behind Forrest Gump and Philadelphia.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont doesn't have a big portfolio, but the one he does have, however small is may be, is very impressive. The Green Mile is his greatest achievement, he will have to go a lone way to even come close to matching it, but he owes almost all of it to Mr Stephen King, for the movie was based on his book and having read the book as well I have to say there is very little different from the book and the movie.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect, Michael Clarke Duncan, produces one of the finest performances that I have seen for a very very long time, he played the big, dumb, soft and lovable John Coffey in a way that no one else could. The performance of Micheal Clarke Duncan is very underrated, it is in the same league as Edward Longshanks in Braveheart, a very much overlooked performance that the Academy Awards failed to acknowledge.<br/><br/>The soundtrack for The Green Mile is very haunting and aids the movie very well, it is not one to listen to on it's own though, it would make one almost too depressed to recover.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, I wish I had the time, but I don't, The Green Mile is simply breathtaking. Is it really 3 hours long? I am not sure, it felt like 1 and half hours whilst I was watching it.<br/><br/>I don't think I will see a movie even half as good as this for a very very long time, that was my thought back in 2000 when I watched it. I am hoping that Tom Hanks delivers another masterpiece in The Da Vinci Code, otherwise I don't see a truly great movie coming out of Hollywood for many many a year."

","I did read the tacky, little books this movie is based-on, when they first came out. I must admit I was not a Stephen King fan, but realized it was an ingenious way to lure people into buying the next installment. I don't remember being overly frightened, nor entertained, when I read them. I guess my imagination isn't that sharp.....it's visual for me. I bought the VHS without hesitation when I saw it - although I'm not a hard-core fan of Tom Hanks, either. The previews for ""Forest Gump"" reassured me I would not like that film, because his ""southern"" accent was far too forced, and knew I wouldn't get a thrill looking at a gang of contrived scenes upon which he would be pasted - that's acting ?<br/><br/>Getting this wonderful film into theaters as quickly as it was done was a major undertaking. Considering its three-hour length, one can get an idea how many miles of wasted film is sitting-around in some vault, unless the first ""take"" of every scene was perfect. Don't hold your breath for that: when you're dealing with a number of actors in a multitude of scenes, you can bet someone was not quite perfect. The only way to test that is to watch the ""dailies"", hoping 50+ takes aren't wasted film. You can't use it again, like magnetic tape or digital images. Once the film is exposed, that's what you get and is a MAJOR cost for making a film of this length. I never waited with baited breath for a film just because it was being directed by a certain person, edited by a certain person; some actors I watch for new work, but many are often miscast.<br/><br/>The beauty of a film - once it is handed to them - IS determined by the skill of the editor. Yet, their work is usually hampered by a dictatorial director, impositions from producers and influence of some of the actors. Unless they can demonstrate a ""cut"" would be more valuable to the over-all beauty of the film, their expertise and their foresight usually are disregarded, because they work under extreme scrutiny. Yet, their work is more intense than any other individual working on the film. The raw footage has to be put together, regardless. A good editor can judge where the movie is going, just looking at the film as it is handed to them. Unless he has worked with a director several times, they don't always agree - if they can convince the director to consider another premise, it is this artist who can influence the scenes to be re-shot, even after the film is considered to be ""in the can"". If the director wants to do a re-cut, it's this artist who must remember - or search the unused film - what he saw where and do the actual work. An editor must be a very open-minded, resilient artist.<br/><br/>A script is only pages with words on them - how often is the entire script re-written? Who else knew the depth of the characters but Stephen King? Maybe a suggestion here, a suggestion there......he was a natural to write the script. If an actor says ""what a beautiful script"", it is usually said in self-interest, because they must give the words life. True acting-artists have a foresight of the entire film, scene-by-scene, and sacrifices some of his value to allow all of the actors to give their best work, gambling on the finished product will be a film an audience wants to watch. How sad so little mention is given to the person who keeps detailed notations of every detail of the scene - who was where, the last line to be spoken, how the actors looked, etc.....invaluable.....considering what prominent billing is given to cameramen, lighting technicians, set-dressers and myriad other craftsmen.<br/><br/>These are only some of the most important protagonists in the making of a movie; if they were female, right on. ""The credits"" list the hundreds of other people involved. If some of them say ""it was fun,"" it is usually in relief it all came together so quickly, ""fun"" being translated into dedicated ""work"". To produce a monumental film such as ""The Green Mile"" is, multiply the effort by a thousand. That the film was produced in such a short period of time is a testament of the MONUMENTAL effort made by all concerned, to produce something to be proud of.<br/><br/>Even the least important worker on this film can be proud. I'm certain there was much applause on the sets to reward extra-ordinary effort. It is a film to readily cry over, because not only is the story inspiring and magical in every way, it draws the viewer into it to live the story, never having seen the insides of a prison. I've written these dull comments to demonstrate the behind-the-scene effort to make the classical film it is. How fortunate we'll always have it.<br/><br/>6/16/07 - THE 2ND VHS CASSETTE - Every time I need inspiration, a quiet lesson in compassion - whatever - I play this consummate piece of what I consider to be best of what I've ever seen for the greatest, truest display of acting-talent, sure-sighted direction and - again - the ultimate editing. I doubt seriously if a better cast will ever be assembled again, or a more realistic filming of how things were ""then"". Every scene is perfect. If you haven't watched ""The Green Mile"", DO - and really get into it. The second cassettte contains all you need to remember about the easily understood horrors of the first. This is not a ""flick"" - it is an experience."

","Can you imagine if you should die because no mistake you've done? The Green Mile shows us about that. That was must be faced by John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), the black prisoner, who was judged guilty as the murder of two little girls.<br/><br/>At the first sight, you'll know that John Coffey was not guilty at all. He's innocent, and truly he's a good man. John Coffey, J.C., might be related with Jesus Christ. Stephen King, who was the writer of the novel, that has the same title, The Green Mile, on his memoir, Stephen King on Writing, said that he doesn't want to make a comment about that relation (I read the memoir in Indonesian translation). But, Roger Ebert, the famous movie-reviewer said that the execution of John Coffey, ""... reminded of another execution some 2,000 years ago"" in Calvary, of course.<br/><br/>The Green Mile, or Death Row is a place for the highly rated criminals. This place is a dungeon before the criminals have their executions. Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the man in charge there. Three executions are show in this film: Arlen Bitterbuck, Eduard Delacroix and John Coffey.<br/><br/>Besides three executions, there are three miracles happen in this story. The miracles are doing by John Coffey. It happens to Paul who felt painful injection, Melinda Moores who has an emotional-psychological error, and a nice mouse that belongs to Eduard Delacroix that almost found its death. After the miracles happen, John Coffey always feel tired. He said that he was taken the disease from the sick and then put that in his body. I guess, by these three executions-miracles, the story wants to show us about the connection between justice and mercy.<br/><br/>Personally, this movie speaks so strong to me on two things. First, it's about the sacrifice. John Coffey takes the disease and let himself suffered because of the disease. Second, it's about life after death. John Coffey doesn't afraid of the death because he knows where the place he will go after the death.<br/><br/>John Coffey finally died. He must replace the truly killer of two innocent little girls. Paul wants to release him from the jail but John doesn't need to. He said that he wants to go out of this world because he sick to see evil. He longs for peace... in the other world."

","I had no experience with the book. I should have suspected that the supernatural would begin to play into this. It took me a while to get away from it being a grandchild of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" to a movie about healing and the power to heal. The whole issue of the electric chair is what I remember the most. The dramatic way we have performed capital punishment. I remember Susan Hayward in "" I Want to Live."" I was 10 years old and the movie still haunts me. Had this man not been a healer, a supernatural creature, the story would have been just fine. His character is so multi-dimensional in the way it lights up a screen. He has that strong presence that says, ""All will be right."" He goes about his business despite the hatred that hovers around him, the redneck culture that has done this to him. He holds his head high because he is right. Tom Hanks is second in the portrayal of pain, both physical and emotional. He is such a heroic figure himself. This is quite a film.<br/><br/>I am going to have to agree, however, with the people who complain about the length. I believe with proper film editing, this could have been a compact two and a half hours and it would have had much more impact on the audience. There are times when one says, enough, and I hate to be thinking that. I found my mind wandering at times. That mentioned, see this, but be prepared for a movie of human ugliness but hopefulness."

","'The Green Mile' is a prison film like no other. It's a story told from the point of view of a prison guard (Tom Hanks) about one special prisoner with magical healing powers and the people in his unfortunate life. The film has an artistic and deep psychological meaning behind it. It's got a sense of a spiritual theme throughout; the main prisoner could be seen as a Christ figure who magically heals those around him and who is wrongly accused of a crime and sentenced to death. It is a moving and emotional story with several engaging and interesting characters and a deep, spiritual plot.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed 'The Shawshank Redemption', you'll probably enjoy this.

","This truly is one of the greatest movies ever made. It has a fantastic plot, with amazing performances from Tom Hanks as Edgecomb and Michael Clarke Duncan (I think) as John Coffey. Although some people may find it a little slow, if you enjoy drama, this will definitely be a moving experience for you. Don't forget though, it IS Stephen King, so it has to be violent somewhere. That somewhere is where Delacroix is brutally executed with a dry head sponge, causing him to catch fire, and start to melt. Also when Percy gets a brain tumor blown into him, and he shoots William ""Wild Bill"" Wharton. This eerily haunting movie is, in my opinion, the greatest movie ever made (tied with some others of course)."
"Bogmeister","8","0","2","23 July 2005"," The Long Mile of Hanks & Darabont
","The adaptation of the Stephen King serial novel is given the A-class treatment by Frank Darabont, the same guy who did The Shawshank Redemption(1994), which has gained a great rep since the nineties ended. With a running time of 3 hours, plus the end credits, the pic needs to keep the viewer's attention on an above-average story - which it does. Darabont's style reminds me mostly of Stanley Kubrick's, another Director who tended towards long films. Somehow, Darabont manages to imbue almost every scene with some point of interest, whether it's Hanks' decent everyman struggling with more out-of-the-ordinary scenarios & decisions, or the nearly magical mouse which piques our curiosity in the prison (where much of the story takes place). Of course, it helps to have Hanks as the main actor to carry the picture. The sense of magic is what gives the story that extra lift. King's characters are transposed to the screen with empowering iconic attributes - the basics of humanity are represented in the guards & prisoners: strength, fear, sadism, grief, regret, compassion - all revolving about the 2 big basics of good vs. evil. How they all respond to the signs of magic touching their lives is what attracts the viewer's interest. Since it's not really grounded in reality, the pic sets up the comeuppance of the traditional 'bad guy' (a truly scummy guard) to satisfy the viewer's sense of justice, in ways we know will never happen in our cynical real life."

","The Green Mile - <br/><br/>Spoilers herein<br/><br/>I decided to see the Green Mile right after finishing the novel by Stephen King, to see if the movie lived up to it's glowing reputation. While I didn't doubt that the film would be good, I had my doubts if it could match the greatness of the novel, which I was truly blown away by. Needless to say... the movie is easily as good as the book, if not better, which is an occurrence that seems to happen less and less in movies these days. But with the Green Mile, director Frank Darabont and a superb cast have put together a truly touching and affecting story. <br/><br/>Darabont, who also transferred the novel to a screenplay, is wise enough to know that Stephen King's original works are good enough without changing, and so he keeps virtually all spoken lines and events EXACTLY (and I'm not exaggerating) the same as in the novel, except for the odd time when he adds an extra line of dialogue or two to help clarify something the narrator originally said. This approach actually works out really well; it might have seemed patchy and awkward in a worst case scenario. <br/><br/>Fortunately, the excellent cast is too experienced to let that happen. Tom Hanks, in one of his best performances yet, is wonderful as Paul Edgecomb, a prison guard on death row who comes across events he was by no means ready for. But it is safe to say that he is overshadowed (in more ways than one) by the simply wonderful performance given by Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, Edgecomb's prisoner who turns out to have 'special gifts'. It's a complex enough role as is, but Duncan brings so much more to Coffey than just crying and acting dim. Beneath Coffey's outward simple mindedness, (""The name's John Coffey. Like the drink, 'cept not spelled the same."") there is a searing intelligence waiting just under the exterior, just enough for us to notice. Duncan really turns Coffey into a sympathetic character, and from the beginning, it is impossible to believe that Coffey was capable of raping and murdering two little girls - so much are we compelled to care about him. It is beyond me how Duncan could have lost out at the Oscars that year, one of the most potent examples, in my opinion, of how the Academy is more about politics than artistic merit.<br/><br/>David Morse is terrific as 'Brutal' Howell, another guard and close friend of Edgecomb's. Morse perfectly personifies the character from the novel, and perfectly plays the role of the kind and sensitive man beneath a huge, tough exterior. Doug Hutchison is wonderfully despicable as Percy Wetmore, the spoiled brat of a prison guard, who no one can complain about, because of his political connections. So evil is Percy to all the helpless prisoners (who we care for a lot more than him) that we can't help but hate him, and feel truly satisfied when he is confined to a mental hospital at the end from being touched by Coffey, who referred to him as a 'bad man'. Sam Rockwell plays a wonderful psycho as 'Wild Bill' Wharton, going gleefully over the top, and still not seeming out of place. I was also very impressed by the performance of the late Michael Jeter as french prisoner Eduard Delacroix, he gave an excellent performance, and had exactly the same appearance and mannerisms as the character did in the novel. All around, highly impressive performances.<br/><br/>The only noticeable flaw in The Green Mile is that with it's lengthy running time, the story seems a little slow paced at times, and too quickly paced at others. Arlen Bitterbuck, (played by Graham Greene) who was a significant character in the novel, is reduced to only once scene of dialogue, and two quick shots of him sitting in his cell in earlier scenes. The only possible reason I could find for shortening Bitterbuck's screen time so significantly would be to quicken the pace of the movie more, but since other parts drag, this intent doesn't exactly work. It's not a huge issue, but it's one that was bothering me as I watched the film. <br/><br/>There's no doubt that The Green Mile is a highly impressive piece of work, or that it carries heavy emotional impact. An excellent storyline from the excellent Stephen King novel is updated into a truly excellent movie. Now, if only we were able to say that more often...<br/><br/>-9.5/10"

","There are plenty of films based on novels by Stephen King. Some are truly classic... like Pet Sematary, Cujo, Shawshank Redemption or Apt Pupil; and some are crap like Maximum Overdrive, Carrie, The Dark Half or Dreamcatcher. There are good movies based on not-so-good novels, and there are unsatisfactory screen adaptations of excellent King thrillers. ""The Green Mile"" is one of the good movies based on a not-so-good novel by Mr King. Perhaps the principal reason for this is its very good casting. Now-a-days you can always expect an above-average performance from Tom Hanks, and here he is once again at his best. Michael Clark Duncan looks extremely realistic as the convict John Coffey. And the rest of the supporting cast are also excellent, especially Sam Rockwell and Mike Jeter. Gary Sinise again mesmerizes us with a brilliant cameo.

","'The Green Mile' is an unforgettable film. It is by turn moving, inspiring, magical and uplifting. Written and directed by Frank Darabont of Shawshank Redemption fame it tells a tale of prison life in Louisiana in the thirties and the experiences of a set of inmates and guards on death row there, commonly known as 'The Green Mile' due to the colour of it's linoleum floor. Based on a story by Stephen King, the main thread of the film concerns a new inmate on the mile, John Coffey ('like the drink just not spelt the same'), who is facing the electric chair on account of his murdering two young sisters. It soon becomes clear there is more to Coffey (a breathtaking turn by Michael Clarke Duncan) than meets the eye and he takes centre stage in this expertly crafted, layered tale of compassion, friendship and loss. Along with 'Hotel Rwanda' this is possibly the most emotional film I have seen and as you follow the paths of the condemned inmates to their final reckonings you will find yourself on several occasions moved nearly to tears. The cast as a whole produce stellar, career best performances (even Tom Hanks) and the character development and pacing of the film is wonderful. I'm a big fan of 'The Shawshank Redemption' but for sheer raw emotion you will probably never see a better film than 'The Green Mile'."

","Having watched this movie some time ago, I had forgotten the impact of the characters, the environment and the story as a whole. Since re-watching it over the last couple of journeys to work, I have found myself wanting to know more. More about the book it was based on, more about the main characters and more about the people that portray them. For a movie that lasts three whole hours, it produces a paradox, in that, at the same time as feeling that the time goes quickly, thanks to the engaging action and people, it also feels like you have lived alongside the characters for the period covered in the film. A huge thank you, and hearty congratulations, to everyone involved with this project for the truly spectacular event they have provided. Finally, I can't understand why this isn't MUCH higher in the ""Top 250"", so if you feel as I do about this film, please vote it higher."

"Sylviastel","10","0","1","21 February 2005"," Your view of Death Penalty will change from watching this movie!
","Despite the difficult subject of death row, Stephen King's Green Mile is a story about death row inmates and the men who guard and will execute them in the end. The cast is excellent with Tom Hanks always turning in an Academy Award winning performance as the head guard. I never imagined the Bosom buddy could be brutal. He is surrounded by very accomplished actors and actresses-Bonnie Hunt plays his wife and Patricia Clarkson plays the ill-stricken wife of James Cromwell's character. I enjoyed watching professional actors like James Cromwell, Harry Dean Stanton and William Morse turn in excellent performances all around. I have to say that I was saddened by Michael Jeter's finest performance in the movie before his own death by AIDS. Of course, the main reason I watched was for Doug Hutchison who now plays Sebastian Hulce on Guiding Light, my favorite soap. As wonderful as he was in The Green Mile, he is better as Sebastian. I found his performance to be a breakthrough performance for somebody. But it is Michael Clarke Duncan who truly earned his Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor that was really inspiring to watch. If you ever had a definite view of the death penalty, this film will change your mind about the barbarism and cruelty not on the death row inmates but on the guards themselves. I probably won't watch this film again. I get too emotionally involved. I am glad that the electric chair is not used like it used to be. It is rarely used nowadays. It is replaced by lethal injection. But now I wonder about the guards who befriend and form relationships with their prisoners whether they liked it or not. Now I wonder what happens to the guards after they become executioners themselves? You wonder what makes them different from the criminals!"

I sat the whole three hours, totally engrossed in this movie and it's characters. The three hours seemed like only minutes. Tom Hanks was spectacular! I had never seen Doug Hutchinson in anything, but he did such a wonderful job as Percy, that I actually found myself disliking the man, not just the character. Michael Duncan Clarke gave an incredible performance as John Coffey, and I don't feel he was given the credit he deserved. Eduard Delacroix, played beautifully by Michael Jeter, is a wonderful, charming, quirky, character.Michael Jeter's performance had you not only liking a convict, but you find yourself rooting for him. All of the characters displayed compassion, yet they were tough when they had to be. The movie is about life and death on ""The Mile"", yet it really isn't...there is much more to it that that.

"CurtMan@LVCM.com","Null","0","2","21 October 2004"," A Powerful and Remarkable Masterpiece
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""The Green Mile"" delves into the world of the human soul and powerful emotion more than practically any film I have yet to see, and it works brilliantly as a somber, delightful, bewildering, and lamentable study of the discovery of the human spirit through human connection. Hanks plays a prison guard presiding over a death row commission who initially performs his duties as an officer and has few compunctions about his role in terminating convicted death row mates. That is, until the day a miracle and a leviathon of a man by the name of John Coffey enters the prison for unknown circumstances and enters Hanks' stream of consciousness as well as his responsibilities. Coffey isn't like any other hostile prisoner Edgecomb (Hanks) has ever seen or known, for he has phenomenal, miraculous abilities, and completely reforms the prison for the lighter and the better for both the guards and the inmates, and provides the ultimate wonder and importance to the story: miracles can happen in the most unlikeliest of places and affect everybody and everything, in this case, the penitentiary where Coffey is (wrongfully) confined as well as the unjust, ignorant prison system which rendered him a death sentence for a brutal, heinous murder. The acting throughout the film is nothing short of passionate, human, and touching: Michael Jeter is superbly human and engaging as Del, and Michael Clarke Duncan is amazingly genuine as John Coffey, both actors clearly outshining the low-key Tom Hanks in an absolute rarity wherever Hanks is concerned. The atmosphere given, is ultimately sorrowful and depressing, and is scarcely uplifting in its somber tone, yet it is much, much more substantial than a random tearjerker: the audience actually feels the characters and the scenarios which befall them, and it's not simply the women who will be emotionally affected, but I defy anyone who watches, in particular, the scenes of the executions, and not shed a single tear in grief and sorrow. It is curious and perhaps deceptive for the film to not reveal the nature of the inmates' sentences: of course, then again we would like to assume a character as genial and benign as Del is as he is portrayed, rather than being a deranged, ruthless killer or whatever his action for ending up on death row, might detract of him. There are many curious symbols in the film which are delightful and relevant to the film's theme: the mouse (""Mr. Jingles"") provides hope and inspiration to the imprisoned men and eventually to Edgecomb himself, the arrogant, beleaguering ""Percy"" is clearly a corrupt and unworthy possessor of undeserved power and authority, and Coffey (including his mystifying touches) is the miracle of the story, providing relief, resilience, and recovery to a problematic system and the troubled nature of life. The film succeeds with passionately and humanly in its direction (the director behind ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has been robbed too many times from acclamation), acting (practically every character shines and contributes enormous wealth to the story and the film), and screenplay (some of the most heartfelt and memorable exchanges in film history include, ""I tried to take it back, Boss"" (Coffey) and ""I just can't see God putting a gift like that in the hands of a man who would kill a child"" (Edgecomb)... timeless. ""The Green Mile"" ranks as one of the most effective, genuine, and wonderful experiences you'll ever be rewarded in film, especially in today's perfunctory approach to the human spirit and emotion running rampant throughout Hollywood, where such concentration is plenty appreciated in this excellent film. **** out of ****"

","Stephen King wouldn't write an ordinary prison story (though staying in the realm of the natural, Shawshank Redemption certainly wasn't ordinary), and this film adaptation of his serialized novel shows it. Set in a southern Depression-era prison (as an extended flashback), a humane prison guard captain on Death Row (Tom Hanks) encounters the miraculous healing powers of a seemingly simple-minded, illiterate, but huge black inmate named John Coffey, portrayed in a break-through performance by Michael Clarke Duncan, convicted of raping and murdering two young white girls. We know this man wouldn't deliberately do such a thing, but there is little predictable and much original in the unfolding of events both in the prison and in the lives of all those who come in touch with this unlikely, gentle healer. In its own way this fim too is ""redemptive."" A superb supporting cast makes this film, which never drags in its three-hour tenure, truly top-rate."

I have watched Morse since he had been in ""Contact"" and ""The Negotiator"" and my conclusion is that his presence is felt immediately upon entering a scene. <br/><br/>Michael Clarke Duncan's performance as John Coffey, a man filled with hope and miracles, blew me away since it showed how much talent this giant of a young actor really has. Duncan's performance was touching and the best of his career. The plot of this movie is really good because it really does give human faces to the prison guards who have the toughest job of all, which is guarding death row. <br/><br/>The only thing I did not like about this film was 30 minutes longer than it needed to be. For example, the first 30 minutes should have been edited out because I feel it had nothing to do with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>This has the best ensemble cast of 1999 as well as the best of the year in my opinion.

I have read the book, and found it less graphic, so i coped a bit better with the reading than the watching, as I cried much less!<br/><br/>If anyone is not touched psycologically by this film, then they cant be human. I cant say that this film is one of my favourites, thats not the way I could describe it, as it isnt that sort of film.

","I saw 5 minutes of this movie once when it was on TV and didn't really think much of it. When it was on again and there was nothing else on i decided to sit down and watch it. I was absolutely astounded. I have never been so touched by a movie in my life. The script, directing, acting, effects. absolutely everything in this movie was perfect.Firstly the story was terrific and not complicated and Frank Darabont produced a terrific script that should have won an Oscar along with his terrific direction. The acting was utterly superb. every single actor and actress in this movie were terrific. These included Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, Michael Jeter, David Morse, Bonnie hunt and many more. However out of them all the 2 actors that touched me the most were Jeter and Duncan. I heard never seen Michael Clarke Duncan in another movie before until i saw this and he produced the best performance i have ever seen an actor give! How he did not win the Oscar for it, i will never know but i can assure you he gave the best performance an actor could give. Michael Jeter also came over my predictability as Del. i had only seen him in JP3 in a smaller part but he was excellent and made his character touching and had a heart even though he had comitted a murder. I believe his character was designed for a much smaller part but Jeter made him so much better and gave him the heart he had.I am very sad to hear about his death very recently i will greatly miss him as he had a terrific talent and although he was not very well known his performance in this movie will never be forgotten ( at least by me anyway!). Tom Hanks and David Morse are also excellent as the security guards and are brilliant throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Overall this movie showed me that all these smaller actors like David Morse, Michael Jeter and especially Michael Clarke Duncan can act brilliantly even though they are not as famous or well known as Hanks and others. However he heart of this movie comes from believing miracles can happen. I didn't really but after seeing this movie i was always believe in miracles.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont has produced a wonderful classic that should never be forgotten and should be watched by every person with a heart and who has some beliefs. Or someone who doesn't it doesn't matter! After watching this movie i can assure you that you will have second thoughts.<br/><br/>Not to be missed.     10/10"

It's just a little bit too obvious in what it's trying to do and how it pushes the emotional buttons.<br/><br/>I think the most outstanding performances were from the ""heavies"" of the picture in Doug Hutchinson and Sam Rockwell.  Their characters just push up the story and give a sharp edge to what could have been an overly schmaltzy and preachy plot (which is what I was expecting).

","`The Green Mile' was released in 1999 and was directed by Frank Darabont. The film is based on a Stephen King novel.  The setting is a Louisiana prison during the depression in the 1930s.  The name of the film comes from the color of the floor on death row of the prison. The actors portrayed their characters well.  Michael Clark Duncan played John Coffey.  A wrongly accused prisoner on death row, his expression of pain and gentle looks gave an instant impression of his innocence.  His faith healing gift made everyone take notice of him.  Tom Hanks also gave a strong performance as the prison guard.  Although this is not his typical type of character, he pulled off this roll well.  Doug Hutchison played Percy Wetmore, the character everyone loves to hate. Some scenes are a little unbelievable, but then don't most movies have scenes that only happen on the screen?  The movie could have been condensed slightly to shave a little time off the three-hour film. Overall, the movie kept my interest.  It contains some humor, some suspense, and some violence. It made me think about how precious life is. The ending was rather depressing, but made me realize that things don't always turn out like I hope."

","Prisons are miserable places in many cases, but the Green Mile could be the exception. Most of the guards on death row leading up to the execution were conscious of their mandate and behave accordingly with their prisoners. The exception was the stupid guy of Percy Wetmore (played well by Doug Hutchison), who really complicated the lives of the guards with his usual foolish approach to everything. The story should be based in many legends about power of some black people to foresee the future and to cure some health problems. This power is believed to come from gods in the case of Yoruba (Nigeria) belief, so Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, wrongly accused of murdering two children, became a kind of ""god"" in the prison. One of the things that shocked me was the way the electric chair was used early 20th Century. The film was able to give many details, perhaps, for convincing you that this type of execution is not justice and that prison should be more an area for rehabilitation and not only for punishing human beings."
"stefanne3_n","Null","0","1","2 February 2003"," An exquisite display of power
","Frank Darabont returns after the Shawshank Redemption, to produce an adaptation of another Stephen King novel, the Green Mile. The Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile take place in a prison environment, and both films bypass the common King hallmarks of sensationalism by horror.  The Green Mile however, makes use of the supernatural to underline the sensitive and humane message of this movie. Almost an hour longer than the Shawshank Redemption, this movie is not an action packed thriller, hilarious or romantic. It is not even a fast-paced movie.<br/><br/>The director uses the three plus hours to leisurely present a popular theme in the movie genre these days: the endless battle between good and evil. Additionally, the plot skillfully weaves the contrasting difference between wickedness and repentance, heaven and earth. The prevalent sense of fatality in this movie gives it a certain degree of suspense, emotion and excitement combined, to create the perfect formula for an uplifting effect.<br/><br/>Paul Edgecomb, played by Tom Hanks, is the depression era prison guard. His job is to ensure peace on his mile - the last mile any person that enters will ever walk - the Green Mile. Hanks is faced with conflicts, which share a common resolution - miracles can happen where they are least expected. Maintaining peace in a prison block might not be as easy as it may sound; Hanks has to keep one of his malicious co-workers, Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) under strict supervision; he has to help the other prison guards control a new psychotic prisoner, and he is required to ensure the fatal reliability of `old sparky' in the execution room. Several practice runs are necessary before each execution, keeping the guards busy and vulnerable in their intent of keeping the prisoners calm.<br/><br/>John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) is a new inmate brought in Hanks prison block, accused of murdering two little girls and convicted to die in the electric chair. The other death row inmates notice something different about this prisoner.  His gentle demeanor and supernatural abilities unfold the story of the Green Mile. The obvious analogies to Christian culture, seen in the character names, circumstances and story developments are peppered throughout the movie, giving more room for interpretation and making it sometimes more obvious than necessary.<br/><br/>The prison setting and especially the rebellious character of Hutchinson, reminded me of the Last Castle, in which the director, Rod Lurie, also presents a defiant and traitorous personality in the inmate Yates, played by Mark Ruffalo. Additionally, the contrast between Hutchinson and Duncan is similar to the contrasting personalities of Ruffalo and Clifton Collins Jr. (Ramon Aguilar). In the Green Mile, the wicked heart of Hank's fellow guard is contrasted with the docile personality of Duncan. In the Last Castle, the disobedient and defiant fellow inmate is compared with the loyalty and respect of a simple-minded prisoner, son of a mason.<br/><br/>Director Darabont uses light and lighting techniques in a very symbolic way, throughout the movie. The impressive size of the window at the end of the prison block, sometimes letting the light shine down in a single ray, illustrates the ray of hope the inmates have for the world on the outside. Characters are often filmed sitting in front of that window with the sun shining on them, showing the Christian symbolism of light as redemption. Light is also used to manifest nature's anger and disapproval, through lightning at almost every execution. The supernatural element in this movie is also pictured by the force of light.<br/><br/>Darabont does a tremendous job in developing an emotional relationship between the viewer and the characters, especially by presenting several touching conversations between the guards and the inmates, and for what it is worth, giving them a chance to be treated with respect as human beings.<br/><br/>However, the length of this film tries the patience of the viewer. This style of melodrama, and the topic chosen, does not lend itself to such an extended production. In the end, the film's length hinders the full enjoyment and effectiveness of the movie. The Green Mile successfully imparts an emotional impact on the viewer, and leaves the audience with something to meditate about."

","This is a movie on the edge of greatness. That's what comes to my mind as I think about it. There's a great story here (actually a number of stories, intricately woven together into a whole.) There are some fantastic performances. Tom Hanks was good as always, although I didn't think he quite lived up to his Oscar winning performances in ""Forrest Gump"" or ""Philadelphia."" Michael Clarke Duncan perfectly captured the character of the mysterious John Coffey. Was he a child murderer or not? That question will be answered in the movie. But there are still more questions about him that are (appropriately, I think) left to the viewers' imagination. Is he a human with special healing powers or is he some sort of supernatural being - an angel, perhaps? We don't know. But stealing the show I thought was Doug Hutchison as the sadistic prison guard Percy Wetmore. He fits the (admittedly unfair) stereotype of a prison guard: a pathetic little loser who makes himself feel like a man by abusing inmates. Hutchison was excellent.<br/><br/>So if the story and performances are great, why do I say that the movie is only on the edge of greatness? To be quite honest, I can't quite put my finger on it but something here just didn't quite work for me. I found my attention wandering from time to time. True, it's a very long movie (well over three hours) but it wasn't really the length. Maybe there just seemed to be a lot of extraneous detail that seemed to obscure the main focus of the movie, which should have remained on Coffey throughout. Maybe it was the setting of the movie as a flashback. (I found the beginning and ending in the nursing home totally unnecessary, and would have liked the focus to be simply on the Green Mile.) I'm not sure what it was, but it just didn't quite make the grade to a great movie for me. Very good, but not quite great, although it's worth noting that Stephen King was apparently very pleased with this adaptation of his book. (It also provides a good primer in the use of an electric chair, and some graphic depictions of the results of its use.)<br/><br/>7/10"

With Michael Clarke Duncan's inspirational performance it becomes an almost religious experience that really touches you. The rest of the cast are just as good with their more down to earth roles. Yet again Thomas Newman gives us another superb inventive score that confirms him as one of the few original composers still around. I don't mind if Darabont only ever films Stephen King stories about prison life, if their half as good as this I'll be watching them. A stunning miracle of a film. (10/10)"

While it's not an action packed, hilarious, romantic, scary or even very fast movie, it's still one that you can get addicted to (or is this just me?). Most of the characters are likeable - except that evil Percy. I almost cheered when he got sent off to the psycho unit. Of course, John Coffey is my favourite character - the sweet hearted 'giant' with the amazing gift. You just knew from the second he appeared on screen that he was innocent - which is probably why you feel for his character so much more than the others. Probably my second favourite character is 'Wild Bill' - I know that sounds weird coz he was a child murdering nutter, but I thought he was hilarious! I don't know why, but that scene after the guy gets electrocuted, when he's throwing all those feathers around in his cell makes me laugh every time!<br/><br/>The first time I saw this, I was moved to tears. Not just when that guy with the mouse (sorry, it's too late in the day for me to remember his name) got horribly electrocuted, but when the prison guards had to execute the 'gentle giant' who had become a friend to them. Watching the guards themselves cry over his death was enough for me.

","""The Green Mile"" is staged in a Louisiana prison during the Depression. If this setting doesn't sound depressing enough, make it the prison's death row (aka The Green Mile so named because of the color of the floor).  But ""The Green Mile"" is not a litany of prison misery a la HBO's TV series ""Oz"". This is a modern day fable, as fantastical as its medieval forebears, and as multi-layered. <br/><br/>The movie is narrated in flashback by Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), who, from his current domicile in a retirement home, describes the amazing events that occurred to him and his fellow guards decades earlier. At the outset of the story there are four guards assigned to the Green Mile; three decent men and one sadist, looking after three men condemned to die in the prison's crude electric chair.  One of the condemned men, a giant black man, has a special gift, the gift of healing. <br/><br/>There aren't many characters in this 3-hour movie, but it doesn't matter. The screenplay, from a Stephen King novel, moves the story briskly along. The ensemble acting, headed by Hanks, is some of the best of 1999. It's not a happy story, far from it, but it's one worth investing three hours of your time."

","The first time I read Stephen King's The Green Mile, I enjoyed it thoroughly.  But it is only now, three years later, having just read it a second time, that I realize how brilliant a story it is.  This is perhaps King's best book, and oddly enough, its a departure from his genre.  Frank Darabont, who adapted King's novella Rita Hayworth And The Shawshank Redemption into one of the greatest movies ever made, has remained incredibly faithful to the book, and in a way, that's both a curse and a blessing.  The Green Mile does not duplicate the success that Darabont had with Shawshank, but we must remember that such a film as the latter only comes along once in a generation.  Still, this dark parable is incredibly well-realized, with most of the heart-wrenching emotion of the book still intact, thanks to exceptional performances given by all, especially MIchael Clarke Duncan, whose portrayal of the simple-minded miracle of nature John Coffey truly deserved an oscar (this was the ONLY film I have ever cried at the end of)."

","'Powerful' is an understatement to describe this film. The major reason it is so powerful is because it is so long; with hindsight, one can see many of the scenes tend to drag on, to build emotion and suspense, and some perhaps too long. But at the time, it is both effective and entertaining. The movie is made largely through almost flawless performances, particularly the incredibly moving Michael Clarke Duncan as the amazing healer. The only complaints I have are Doug Hutchison as the vengeful guard Percy, who just doesn't seem quite right in some scenes and does not quite create the right amount of tension between himself, the prisoners and the other guards, and the musical score, which I feel could have been better to make a more powerful mood. The movie is incredibly moving, but the score lets it down at times. In fact, sometimes I felt it seemed to be taking more inspiration from the more frightening Stephen King-based movies such as The Tommyknockers than from a powerful movie such as this. Overall, however, an extremely effective and well-made piece of cinema."

Most of all, it has 3+ HOUR RUNNING TIME. Despite all of these factors, The Green Mile is perfectly watchable, if not particularly memorable - it's a great example of how good actors and casting can elevate a potentially terrible movie to a watchable one.  David Morse, who has never stood out in anything I've seen him in, puts in a great performance. Michael Clarke Duncan is no more than a serviceable gentle giant, but his amazing physical presence makes his performance notable nonetheless.  Tom Hanks, as usual, is reliable.

","Among all the literate, lovely remarks from all over the world, why must there always be some Yankophobe posting anti-American remarks about an American film?  If you don't like American cinema, don't watch it. Would you insult Japanese cinema simply because it insists upon being Japanese?<br/><br/>Back to the film -- the story is, I personally believe, in part based on the case of Jude Affey, a black southern US man condemned to death by hanging in the early 1900s. He was called ""Magic Jude Affey"" because he apparently was able to snap the noose from around his neck, then run away, escaping hanging.  In reality, it's widely believed, his jailers/wardens realized he was not guilty, and that the governor of the state had it ""in"" for him. They repeatedly arranged his escape - that's, at least, how the modern theory goes.<br/><br/>Now fancy that -- the story may well be true.<br/><br/>Film is about the exceptional in all people...to the best or worst in human character.  This film is a parable, and should not be received as some social drama rendering reality as its perceived by the status quo.  It drives home its own point, rendered with deeply good, common people.  Such people exist everywhere, even in the US...even among my own people in the south, believe it or not.<br/><br/>Would that the wonderful character at the luminous heart of this story, have met a similar fate to Magic Affey's.<br/><br/>Incidentally, Delacroix was interpreted by Jeeter, unless I'm mistaken, as being Cajun.  Given the region in which the story is set, that's somewhat likely.  Cajun French bears the same resemblance to a continental French accent as a Texas brogue resembles a London accent."

It was great and made me think a lot. I also liked all the miracles he performed, it was interesting as he healed the woman who was quite sick. It was moving. The man who played Perci really did a good job, he made his character completely convincing. As for Tom Hanks, What can I say? He was just great in portraying the main character<br/><br/>The only part I didn't like was the ending. I think it was quite disappointing and unbelievable!

John Coffey is an amazing character and he seems like someone one would find in an X-Files episode, with his wonderful healing powers. I think he is probably supposed to be an angle, as he has gone unnoticed by the public for so long, after all who wouldn't notice a black man in america (back in the 50's I think it was) who is built like a brick outhouse and is about 7 feet tall.

They are all brought up when you watch the film.  It can only be called one of the greats. The actors performances are amazing and you feel, especially, for Michael Clarke Duncan's character, John Coffey. He plays the part from his heart and gives it all he can. I haven't seen many films which star him but if his other performances are like this one then WOW, he's one to watch. I think the other actors also play their parts really well. Doug Hutchison (Percy) is another character that is portrayed well. He plays the part in a way that makes you hate, even loathe him. He is annoying and when he squashes Mr. Jingles you want to climb into the T.V and kill him there and then. But all the actors play their part. Tom Hanks is exceptional as Paul Edgecomb, David Morse as Brutus Howell and Michael Jeter as Eduard 'Del' Delacroix. Everyone fits the parts and plays them the best they can.<br/><br/>I don't think I have felt for a character as much as I did for John Coffey (like the drink but not spelt the same).

","As Stephen King adaptions go, this is somewhere in the middle. While patently no Pet Semetary, it's certainly no Carrie either. the book was published in several instalments, giving the whole enterprise a rambling feel. Darabont tries his best to emulate this, but his incessant desire to include every damn paragraph is just one of the film's flaws. The mysticism which seems believable enough on page just seems completely stupid on screen. This is all without mentioning the crude racial stereotypes, the subserviant black man dying for the whites, and the sub-exorcist subplot. it's not bad, but where shawshank took its meagre source material and expanded on it, Green Mile flounders under the weight of King's words.

","The measure of a great film I find is how well you can remember it in a few months time. If it is truly great you should be able to run through it in your mind like you were back in the theater viewing it for the first time. Other films may be great, but they can fade from ones mind as soon as you get in your car and drive on home. ""The Green Mile"" is a film that is as vividly with me now as it was the day it came out. I have seen it four times and it gets me emotionally each and every time with as much power as it did the first time. I may not be a religious man at all but the themes in this film, what it is really about beneath ths surface are very important.<br/><br/>
The dialogue is some of the best I have heard in ages spoken by a cast that has not a single bad performance. Top among them are Tom Hanks and the exceptional Michael Clarke Duncan. More or less the movie could have been put into shambles by not having the right person in the part. They needed to do the impossible and find the perfect John Coffey, and in the end they did. Duncan is amazing and now perhaps he can stop his former roles of playing bodyguards and bouncers. Next of course is Tom Hanks, who it is almost a waste of words to say that he was great because that is always the case. He lets the role envelope him here and becomes Paul Edgecomb with all his heart. I highly recommend renting the DVD of this film and watching the mini documentary on the film entitled ""Walking The Mile"", it is worth the time."

","This is a film that makes you think!! one of the best film i ever have seen.<br/><br/>Great played by all the actors, it feels like being there yourself, John Coffey is a big man, and his life has been a nightmare, he can feel other peoples pain. even in the moment just before he will be placed in the electric chair. his biggest concern is how the people around him feels, and he give them hope that it´s the right thing that is about to happen, not that he killed anyone, but because he can´t continue to feel all that pain.<br/><br/>Well Tom Hanks... Mmmm what can i say, every time this man is making a movie, it will be a great success an why? i think it´s because Tom Hanks has the gift that he can feel how the person he plays are and give the spectators the same feeling."
"chrisbrown6453","8","0","1","12 July 2001"," Frank Darabont, the director of the greatest film ever made (Shawshank Redemption), what more could you ask for.
","The Green Mile is written and directed by Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption) and based on the six-part serialized novel by Stephen King, narrates the story of Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), the head guard on Death Row at Cold Mountain Penitentiary in Louisiana. The Green Mile is narrated by the retired guard in an extended flashback which takes the viewer to 1935.<br/><br/>The Green Mile, a title which relates to the common way of calling the green floor or walkway from the prisoners' cells to the execution chamber, centers on Edgecomb's kind efforts to maintain order and a certain level of peace among the prisoners until each is escorted to the electric chair. However, the irrepressible, sadistic tendencies of guard Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), whose political connections grant him license to act upon his whims, mock the tranquility that the green mile has come to represent. A symbolic arena that offers a fertile ground for meditation, repentance and redemption, the green mile soon welcomes incoming prisoners: the seven-foot-tall, 330-pound John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), whose evident beast-like strength temporarily blurs his humility and kindness; and the menacing Wild Bill (Sam Rockwell).<br/><br/>Surprisingly The Green Mile shifts its focus from the practical world of Edgecomb to the incredible, supernatural gift of John Coffey, a man who is charged with murdering two girls, but whose ""miracles"" may clear him of guilt as well as provide a higher sense of order in Cold Mountain. This emergence of hope amidst the dead-end reality of the film's most needy characters produces some sparks. However, althoughThe Green Mile's fantastic elements strive toward reaching an optimism, they fail as the film inevitably falls under the weight of the more solid portrayals of evil, misfortune and injustice. All in all, The Green Mile is the result of the troublesome duality of: 1) the realistic depiction of all that is pessimistic and destructive, and 2) the fantastical portrayal of all that promises a full restoration of the spirit."

Even in such light the story is engaging and the actors (Michael Clark Duncan especially, in my opinion) wonderful.  But what really made an impact on me were the subtle (and not-so-subtle...was it that difficult to pick up on the image of the light shining behind John right before his execution?) nuances of the film that alluded to the story of Christ.

","See this movie! <br/><br/>This is an interesting and touching story which is well-written. The sets were simple and the film-making techniques entirely unobtrusive - very little reliance on special effects or gimmickry here. As other films are treats to the eyes, this one is to the soul - celebrating the goodness of a handful of people without overdoing the conflict with evil.<br/><br/>
John Coffey (""like the drink only not spelled the same"") is played brilliantly by Michael Clarke Duncan as a huge and simple man with amazing powers - a sort of combination of John Travolta's character in Phenomenon and Lenny in Of Mice and Men. I'll be looking for his name in future.<br/><br/>Hanks? Well, he's on the top of the heap nowadays so he's attracting a lot of pot-shots but it's difficult to fire any at him based on this performance. Put simply, his performance is flawless - probably too stoic a character to get credit for huge emotional range but all the more believable for it.<br/><br/>The supporting cast (James Cromwell, David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Jeffrey DeMunn and the rest) were almost perfect to a one - communicating their feelings without going over the top with melodrama.<br/><br/>The one criticism (and it's mild) I could level at this film is its length - there are several scenes which are not essential to either the plot or character development which could probably spare this film 1/2 hour with some judicious editing. Plus, the flashbacks which bookend the story did very little for me - I may be wrong but I believe that this film would be just as effective and certainly shorter without them. <br/><br/>Still, this film is entirely enjoyable for its entire 3 hour length. Enjoy it for what it is - a well-acted, well-written touching story about the goodness in (some) people.<br/><br/>P.S. I'll probably be buying a copy of this movie to dust off on some future rainy weekend afternoon."

The supporting cast including David Morse, Doug Hutchinson, Barry Pepper, Michael Jeter, Sam Rockwell, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt etc. etc. also deserve applause for their excellent supporting roles. The fact that this movie is three hours long does put people off but the time flies by so quickly, I didn't want it to end. With all movies there are some flaws and this one has two. The dry sponge and the present day scenes. Do not let that put you off though, every second of this film is certainly a joy to watch crammed with every possible emotion jabbing at your heart. A lot of people ask me, ""is this better than Shawshank?"" I would say yes it is but why don't you decide for yourself.

"Mort-31","7","0","2","6 April 2001"," Poor younger sibling
","Stephen King, Frank Darabont, jail. These are the key words that connect The Shawshank Redemption`, one of America's most popular movies and The Green Mile`. There are slight differences in the base ideas of the two films and for me  probably the greatest fan of Shawshank`  exactly these are also the differences in quality. <br/><br/>Darabont's film no. 1 was too perfectly made and his no. 2 reminds too much of it without being able to compete with it. Somehow the fantastic elements in no. 2 appear disturbing to someone who remembers how well no. 1 worked without anything supernatural. Actually, it's not Frank Darabont's fault that The Green Mile` falls behind Shawshank`; it's Stephen King's. For instance, there is also a twist in the end in no. 2, but it's definitely not as great as the one in no. 1.<br/><br/>Something Darabont hasn't forgot is how to tell a story in cinema and how to produce an authentic atmospehere, though I don't think that there were so many humane prison officers at that time. Michael Clark Duncan was a real fluke: He had no particularly great role at all but he stole the show from everybody. Unfortunately (or luckily), he has a too extraordinary look to get ordinary roles in the future; so we won't see him very often. Tom Hanks did a good job; of course, anyone else could have played his role equally well.<br/><br/>The Green Mile` is a long, fascinatic epos with not two but many outstanding actors, slowly and patiently directed by a man who seems to specialize in makeing films of Stephen King's jail books. Logically, the next movie should come in 2004."

","It is a great story with good acting throughout but it drags on too long. It is obviously a piece of anti-death penalty crap and the gruesome execution of Eduard Delacroix was not necessary. In fact the excruciating detailing of the execution routines could have been and should have been edited out as surplusage. My feeling is the director was so smitten with his work he left little to the cutting room floor. There was much attention to the period detail except a large roll of cellophane tape, which did not exist during the depression years, was used to tape a mouth closed. It also seemed strange that there were so few men on death row at a time when many more people were sentenced to death than are now, although executions were carried out much more swiftly in those days."

Tom Hanks plays a compassionate prison guard, surrounded by generally good people, including the warden. There was one guard who was hated by all the other guards, and especially by the prisoners. I will not go into detail about what happens to the characters, but was pleasantly surprised to see some ""magic"" appear on a few occasions in the movie.

Tom Hanks turns in one of his best performances in this movie.  Michael Clarke Duncan's performance is nothing short of amazing, and is integral in making this such a powerful film.  Yes, it's a long movie, but I felt very satisfied that the complete story had been told by the time it ended.  You won't be short-changed by this one -- you'll know what eventually happened to all of the characters.<br/><br/>I liked the way the central story was told as a flashback from sixty years ago.  There are some very tough characters and some brutally graphic scenes of electrocution, but they help to enforce the strength of the story and the importance of its message.

Why him?  Why does a man convicted to die on death row have this power that could seemingly benefit society as a whole?  Why would he be ""selected"" to be the bearer of this gift, or curse, depending on how you look at it? What do others do when confronted with such a miracle?<br/><br/>It's a movie that questions the characters' faith, their attitudes, their morality, all of which have been tested in a job where they watch the worst of society put to a horrible death.  Now they're confronted by someone and something they have no answer for..<br/><br/>This movie is long, but it develops the characters well.  We feel a sympathy for John Coffey (Duncan), a hatred for Percy, and the uncertainty of what we would do when confronted with a situation that Paul Edgecomb (Hanks) and the rest of the guards experience on death row.

"lakeofire81","Null","0","1","3 March 2001"," Very memorable, brilliant
","Well, not being on the cutting edge of the arts and entertainment scene, I just got around to seeing this great film tonight. Considering its 3-hour length, The Green Mile goes by quickly. This film demands complete involvement of the viewer. Tom Hanks is awesome as the compassionate prison guard. This film looks deeply at the capital punishment issue and, I felt, the absurdity of capital punishment is revealed. A certain ""gallows humor"" permeated the film. Like in Dead Man Walking, I felt helpless and anxious for the character about to be executed. I believe Albert Camus said that men sentenced to die experience more pain than any of their victims because knowing the precise moment and method of your death is much worse than any physical pain. I think most people would agree with Camus, at least to some extent. I can't imagine knowing for years that with each day that passed I was approaching some macabre time and date in which I was scheduled to be executed by a vengeful world.  Of course, a person must do their best to live a life that keeps them out of hell and not commit crimes that our society demands punishment for. If innocent people are executed then...well...this is what scares me...knowing that I could be a kind, decent human being that never hurt anyone, and still be given a death sentence.  I know this is very unlikely and probably sounds paranoid, but it is certainly possible, just watch The Green Mile and see for yourself. I find it difficult to be against the death penalty or to be for it. In a utopia, there would be no crimes and no desire for revenge.  Well, I should stop myself before I become too vague, so just set aside 3 hours and WATCH THIS MOVIE. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."

The film is set in 1935, at a prison in Louisiana, and focuses on Death Row, called the Green Mile. There are a couple of pretty gruesome scenes of executions, including one badly botched one. There is enough character development for the viewer to establish a relationship with all of the characters. Some of these characters are odious, to say the least. A couple are truly lovable. One character, that of John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, is an amazing person. I'll not spoil the film for you, but I will say this particular character is the most lovable of all.

","Would it be unfair of me to think of ""The Green Mile"" as the film that brought back the issue of capital punishment?<br/><br/>Yes, that I would admit, but the film itself is one that can provoke plenty of thoughts.<br/><br/>The film was written and directed by Frank Darabont, who is best known for adapting one of the short stories from Stephen King's ""Different Seasons"", ""The Shawnshank Redemption"".<br/><br/>The story involves an elderly man, Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer) who recalls one year while he (Tom Hanks) was in charge of the Death Row ""E"" block at a prison in Louisana during the Great Depression and met John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a tall prisoner who changed Edgecomb's life.<br/><br/>If there's one part of the film that left me unsatisfied and that would be the film's length.  In this case, the movie is nearly three hours.  Despite that, some of the executions are difficult to handle and in one particular scene, one of the prisoners is burned to a crisp.<br/><br/>However, the film has a great cast and is certainly well acted, most notably Hanks and Duncan, who is great to watch and listen."

Tom Hanks was superb in this movie (Is there anything that this man can't do? )Michael Clarke Duncan also acts superbly as  a prisoner who is innocent and has miracle power.

Everything about the film was beautiful, the performances, the cinematography, the theme.  I cried like a baby and laughed like a loon, and it stuck with me long after the movie finished.  Now that's the sign of an excellent film, one that makes us think and evaluate the society we live in, one that tells of the human condition and how we can all strive for excellence. While American Beauty is also an excellent film, I have no idea how it won the Oscar instead of The Green Mile.

","I have been known to get a little misty eyed during emotional movies.  I've even shed a few tears at particularly moving soap opera weddings and Hallmark Greeting Card commercials.  The Green Mile takes this to a whole new level.  The powerful and gripping screenplay left me not just crying, but sobbing loudly in the theatre.  Even after 2 subsequent viewings, the emotion is still just as vivid as it was the first time around. <br/><br/>
A fabulous motion picture experience.  Frank Darabont has crafted yet another stunning prison drama which, while not quite at the level of ""Shawshank Redemption"", is a very close second.  Tom Hanks is excellent as always, but Michael Clarke Duncan turns in in a performance that clearly holds its own against, and often steals the spotlight from, the veteran Hanks.  <br/><br/>The execution scenes were so brilliantly filmed that they were almost unwatchable.  The gruesome horrors of prison life actually made you empathize with most of the inmates and their death sentences.  Had we been given more details about Del's crimes, however, our sympathy may not have been flowing so freely.  We see him only the simple-minded caregiver of Mr. Jingles, thus making it easier for us to like him. <br/><br/>If I were handed the death sentence for a crime, I'd certainly rather serve it on the Green Mile, where you are treated like a human being by caring prison guards, than in any other prison ever depicted on film.  With the exception of Percy, the guards and wardens in this film have an unbelievable relationship with their prisoners.<br/><br/>The religious references and parallels to a certain Christian figure were none too subtle, but delivered a strong message - if there was a powerful ""healer"" in our midst, would we condemn him just as easily? The bible tells us so.   <br/><br/>All the elements of this film weave seamlessly together to produce a movie that, had it been released a year later against the lack-lustre pictures of 2000, would probably have earned the Oscar for Best Picture.  From the screenplay, to the score, from the performances to the cinematography, Green Mile is a fascinating film that draws you in for three-plus hours and leaves you breathless, not to mention a little misty eyed.<br/><br/>Words cannot possibly do this film justice, a near masterpiece."
"Jane FlamE","10","0","1","24 January 2001"," One of the best adaptions of a King novel
","I have read my fair share of Stephen King's work and I know that I am not alone in thinking that there are very few good films based on his work. Misery and Dolores Claiborne were very good, but this film has outshone the both of them. This tells the story of Paul Edgecombe and his time as an officer on death row during the depression. the film details the events that unfold when convicted murderer John Coffey arrives on the 'Green Mile', the name given to the death row section because of the green linoleum that leads to the chair. Darabont has taken the time and effort to let a truly captivating story unfold and is very faithful to King's Novel and it's spirit, however it is the acting that completes the essence, Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb and Michael Duncan Clark as John Coffey bring King's work to life and as a result, make the audience a part of the events that proceed. Excellent too is the supporting cast, as I often found myself thinking that the actors were exactly as I had imagined the characters in my head when I had first read the novel. This film was probably one of the few gems to come out of 1999."

","Wonderful! I did not feel like I wasted my precious time on earth when I watched this movie. Simply the best movie I have seen since Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>I don't know who deserves the most credit for this movie. Tom Hanks seems to turn out great movies like pimples on a teen's face.  Stephen King has to be one of the most talented people. I often wonder if his children ever ask him to tell them bedtime stories. Mr. Duncan is the epitome of a gentle giant. No man could play John Coffey any better. The other actors played the parts to perfection. The Billy the Kid guy was very annoying and crazy just like he was suppose to be. I was ready to beat him myself.<br/><br/>The only reason this movie scored a 9 and not a 10 is because of the reactions. A human does not react to an unbelievable event that way. If you were at work and saw a man with a swarm of bees flying out of his mouth would you not mention that to your wife when you got home? If you and your co-workers saw a mouse resurrected do you think you might talk about it after you picked up your jaw and cleaned out your soiled bloomers?<br/><br/>The one execution could have possibly been toned down a little. I thought it was always so weird on the number of people that showed up for the executions. Did they sell popcorn and gummy bears there or something?<br/><br/>This is not a Stephen King weird movie even though it may sound like it. Its not your typical brutal prison film. It is new.

I personally think that Frank Darabont wrote this script with Hanks in mind.  The problem he has with his penis...no one could have made that look and even feel so real other than Mr. Hanks.  Critics gave this film a bit of a blasting saying that Darabont was foolish to go back to Stephen King and try and re-create 'Shawshank'.  WRONG!  This aint a re-creation!

"stamper","8","0","1","2 November 2000"," Good follow up to Shawshank
","This film is really good, despite it's length of about three hours and despite the fact that it is somehow unbelievable, for at the film's center there is a inmate, John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) who has supernatural powers. This is actually the basic of the story and one of the things why that Coffey is so memorable to Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks). But there is something else, for that Coffey character has got a character quite opposing his looks and this is something that was really memorable about him as well.<br/><br/>
In this film there are so many good things that I'm afraid I will either forget too many things or that I will write about 3000 words (which is not allowed), so I'll try and keep it short. The actors are all great, from Hanks, to Duncan and Doug Hutchinson (who plays the perfect a..hole). The direction, the music, the script. EVERYTHING is good. OK I must admit, that I thought I'd see a different kind of movie (I didn't know about the supernatural stuff and I must say it is quite SUPERnatural (but who cares)). I sort of expected the same rationally explicable stuff as in the Shawshank Redemption. DAMN was I wrong. After you get used to the supernatural stuff though you get sucked into the story and the three hours feel like much much much less. One thing that helps the movie too, being entertaining, is that in the meantime there is enough other stuff going on and some good one - liners jokes are tossed around. My favorite part of the movie is of course the end of the narrative part of the film, for here no eye will be left dry and you will probably all have tears in your eyes, or even shed a few (like I did). I know my eyes were wet and my throat hurt like hell at the end. This is just one entertaining, funny, moving and original movie which is just as good as Darabont's Shawshank Redemption.

But with movies like ""The Green Mile"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" one has to give credit for coming up with very good stories that adapt well to the screen.  The acting in this movie is first rate.  And although there isn't an overt ""message"" about the death penalty a la ""Dead Man Walking,"" the story and depiction of the process is so good that it makes one really question the necessity of the state to consciously and legally kill.

I have to say no. However, I really liked this film. It was very touching and engrossing, it didn't feel almost three hours long. Tom Hanks gave a nice performance. Michael Clarke Duncan was quite brilliant, very much worthy of the Oscar nod this year. The main problem, though, is the fact that the film *is* three hours long. According to me, there were several scenes in the film that were unnecessary, for instance, they could have left out the opening and closing scenes since they made the story kind of ridiculous. Overall, though, ""The Green Mile"" was an engrossing movie experience (it's been a long time since I cried so much during a film), the acting was great, but sadly a few scenes were superfluous.

"Captain Ed","10","0","1","24 October 2000"," One of the best movies I've seen in a while
","The Green Mile is an outstanding movie, one that leaves you with a bittersweet feeling that moves more toward the bitter in a courageous manner.  The performances are powerful, without exception.  Some of the actors in the movie are usually used as heavies in other films, especially David Morse, but are played against type to great effect.  In fact, almost everyone in this movie is a well-known actor from featured roles in the past.  Harry Dean Stanton is as excellent as he ever is in a small, comedic role as the exceution stand-in.  I felt that Sam Rockwell (hilarious as Crewman #6 in Galaxy Quest) was outstanding as Wild Bill, a psychotic who provides both comedy and stark evil.  Hanks provides his usual wonderful, understated performance.  But Michael Clarke Duncan is a revelation.  For a man as massive as he is, he moves with a gentle grace, and for a man whose career has just started to take off, he steals the focus in every scene. Pretty darn difficult to do with these actors, and to their credit, they don't fight it -- they allow Duncan to be the focus.<br/><br/>The story?  Well, the movie uses a framing/flashback technique to allow us to go back in time to the Depression and a Louisiana death row.  Almost all of the film takes place in a confined, brown, depressing corridor with green Linoleum and caged men on both sides.  The main story starts out when John Coffey (Duncan) is brought into the Mile, convicted of raping and murdering two little girls (and can you remember what Bruce Willis movie the father was in??).  The guards, gentlemen all with one exception, begin to sense that there's something very unusual about John.<br/><br/>The interplay between the guards and the inmates serve to remind us that there's humanity on both sides, and the two antagonists  (one guard, one inmate) seem to be an allegory for the dehumanization that's occurred on both sides in modern times.  Make no mistake, this movie is anti-death penalty, but its points are made in measured tones, with respect to both sides (I believe).  It is no diatribe.<br/><br/>The final scenes are so simple and powerful that they brought tears to my eyes and have haunted me for days.  This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time.  If possible, watch it on DVD for the best effect."

It fits the story, but at the same time you get too much time to think about the plot and how silly it all actually is. But: King kept the horrorlevel low (Darabont made the supernatural elements even more important...)and the ending fitting. King's obvious references to religion and Christ: Coffey, the miracles , the chair being a modern day cross, sin and redemption, are done well and they do make you think. <br/><br/>The most important thing for me is that I now realise what good an actor Hanks is.

Paul gives the mouse to Coffey, after what he wipes his shoulder with a handkerchief. I think it's not quite in the spirit of the moment, and not in the line of the character too.

","First, I'd just like to say that this movie could not be anything near what it was without the wonderful cast and script.  Although, I think that the best part of the whole movie comes at the end of the movie with this quote from John Coffey: ""...I'm tired of people bein' mean and ugly to each other.""  When I heard this, it hit a personal note inside of me.  For a long time, I have been frustrated and very disappointed by the amount of horrible things that happen to people because of a difference of opinion or slight misunderstanding.  If even a few people thought about what this is trying to point out, then I feel that a lot of the problems that we have in society would gradually disappear.  I hope that all of you reading this realize what this movie is really trying to say, and take that to heart and try to do something about it.  Even if it means showing a little kindness to the next-door neighbor, or hi to the security guards at the mall or anyone that normally doesn't get any courtesy.  This will brighten their day, and will make you feel better too.  I don't mean to be conceited, but every effort really does help.

If you don't think about it, the enjoyment of the movie is totally missed and you've wasted three hours.  But if you really get into it, and really think about everything, almost every part of the movie is relavent to another part.  The movie Coffey watches at the end, the ""trying to take it back,"" all of it, and there's just too much to put into even three commentary notes.  So, I implore you when you watch this movie again, to watch it for these reasons, and more than what I have said.  But most of all, please try to spark these thoughts in your family and friends, and the world will truly be a better place."

There is some violence, language, etc but who ever heard of a death row without it.  The characters are portrayed superbly by the actors/ actresses and just as we switched to the second tape I realized what was coming.  Not as stunning as 6th sense but a real ride emotionally."
"UnCritic","7","0","1","20 August 2000"," Cinematic mastery of a not-so-masterful King story.
","Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend it, and the director/writer/producer did a fine job.<br/><br/>The main complaints of critics was that the film is too long. Poppycock I say, a great movie is a great movie no matter the length. The film never sags or gets boring. I never found myself disconnecting from the film to check my watch. I was caught up in the film and forgot about the passage of time-- the mark of a true cinematic experience.<br/><br/>The only negative thing I have to say about this film is that unlike Shawshank Redemption, in which the director/screenwriter took a Stephen King short story and created a truly transcendent experience, the Green Mile is one of King's hokier recent stories (originally sold *by the chapter* if you can believe it), and in the end King lets us down gently with a somewhat unspectacular climax.<br/><br/>However, if you think that ""Shawshank"" is one of the best films of modern times as I do, then you'll enjoy this film. And if you haven't seen Shawshank, watch it instead-- or watch it after you see Green Mile, and save the best for last."

","I read the book about a year ago, and I was very excited to see the movie for two reasons - Frank Darabont and Tom Hanks. While Frank Darabont has only done two movies, both of which are Stephen King stories set in the past and in prison, he has done them extraordinarily well. Well enough to receive Best Picture nominations for both, in fact. Tom Hanks was great as usual as Paul Edgecomb, but Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey made the movie as terrific as it was. His portrayal was exactly what I visualized while reading the book. This was the first time that I've ever been not only satisfied but thrilled about how well a book was transformed into a movie. Most of my favorite parts of dialogue, such as the seen where Arlen's death is being rehearsed, are included almost word for word in the movie. Incredible. My hat is off to Frank Darabont for making this avid reader a huge fan of his work."
"lebowski_achiever","6","0","1","7 August 2000"," Stephen King story yet again makes a good movie
","What makes a story by Stephen King so adaptable for the screen?  The green Mile is a great example of showing the worst and the best in human nature all in one fell swoop.  Of course it is impossible to steer clear of comparison to the Shawshank Redemption, especially as it is directed by Darabont who accomplished to make one of the greatest films of all time. The green mile is arguably not as good as Shawshank Redemption but it is a prison drama told from a completely different angle and that is why one is not disappointed when watching it.  It has very sentimental moments and it has a certain self-congratulatory and self-conscious feel when it comes to relationship between Coffey and all the ""good white folk"" in the sense of: ""look how sensitive we are handling the race issue"".  The role of John Coffey is well portrayed and I love the way you can speculate about where he came from and how old he really is but the film does sometimes fall into sentimentality that evokes resistance to the fantastic story being told. Tom Hanks is reliable as ever in a story that would put anyone off the death penalty but then decides to change its mind in the end by condoning the death penalty after all but only for very, very, bad people.<br/><br/>So all in all a good movie that doesn't particularly linger on in memory mainly due to the deliberate tugging at heart strings."

","I liked this movie, I really did, I never read the original story in it's serial form, and only having heard it excerpted I had no expectations. Well, I figured that as with most adaptations of King's books, this one had the potential to fail as dismally as others have. That ""The Green Mile"" was as good as it is overall proved that in the proper hands, King's stories can make enjoyable, if not astounding, film.<br/><br/>I guess my only real problem with the movie has to do with some technical issues.  I was really disappointed over the use of modern clear plastic packaging tape when Percy was confined to the restraint room.  In light of the fact that the story's original date was set in 1932 but was adapted to make use of the film ""Top Hat"" from 1935, and that the story itself mentions the use of friction tape (certainly more appropriate to the time), the use of a modern roll of tape was just sloppy!<br/><br/>Another thing would have to be the healing method that John used, in the instances of both Mr. Jingles and the Warden's wife, John ""takes if back"" by sucking the death/illness from the mouths of these creatures...well, not to be too disgusting here, but how is it that he was able to help Paul by merely grabbing his crotch?  I guess that would have changed the ratings at the very least!<br/><br/>Otherwise, beyond where the film falters, there is an absorbing story about the many ways people struggle with a ""gift"", whether it's their own, or someone else's.  I would recommend it for that alone."

"keithanddeenie","10","0","1","11 July 2000"," As fine a movie as I've seen in a long time.
","The Green Mile is the finest screen adaptation to date of a Stephen King novel.  King, the master of horror, has always been a moralist at heart. The struggle between good and evil permeates his works.  At times he has gotten a bit heavy-handed with that theme (The Stand), but not in The Green Mile.  This story, told from the viewpoint of a Louisiana deathhouse guard (Tom Hanks) in 1935, blends the supernatural with morality so delicately as to season it to reality.  We don't have to strain in order to suspend our disbelief.  It is easy to believe in miracles.  Most people, even murderers, are basically good.  The real horror, more so than vampires and werewolves, is the fear and the hatred inspired by the very few truly evil people who live amongst us.  As John Coffey (note the initials), Michael Clarke Duncan is a wonder.  The sheer size of the man (he must be bigger than Shaquille O'Neal) is our first, awesome impression, but his abilities as a performer might dwarf his physical stature.  He is a gifted actor, who unfortunately might, because of his physical dimensions, not find enough roles that suit him.  Duncan plays the opposites of anger and gentleness so effectively that he can frighten in one moment and soothe in practically the next breath. This is to take nothing away from Tom Hanks, who has the knack of always convincing me that no one but he could assay his character as effectively. He is seamless in his portrayals and The Green Mile is just one more example of his talent.  The scenes with Duncan and Hanks together are the highlights of this film.  The work of the supporting cast and of director Frank Darabont should also be noted.  This is as fine a movie as I've seen in a long time."

"manos","4","0","3","1 July 2000"," King's patented ""Two-dimensional Character"" development
","I've got to say that I'd hoped to like this movie.  And, to be honest, the acting and look of the film  is top-notch.  The huge weak link in the entire production is the story.  And for me that's the entire movie.<br/><br/>After all, I bear a strong resemblance to Stephen King (Really!  Pity me). I'd like to be able to be mistakenly associated with someone I could be proud of.  Sadly, I do not admire King's character development.  I have a problem with his ""good vs. evil"" running commentary.  I appreciate more depth in literary figures than Stephen King is capable of delivering.<br/><br/>I could give several examples of flaws throughout this film.  Why did no one expose Mr. Coffey's ability?  Why did the evil ""Wild Bill"" remain quite in key scenes like the pre-execution turned awry?  How could a prison official in the 1930's let a black convicted murderer enter his wife's room and watch as the killer placed his lips on that of the warden's ailing spouse?<br/><br/>Too bad the project wasn't handled by Touchstone Pictures.  Maybe then we'd see more parallels being drawn between Mister Jingles and Mickey Mouse. Mouseville in Florida?  Puts me in the mind of Goofy.<br/><br/>While having pure characters with contrasts as obvious as ""black and white"" (no play on words intended) make easy paint-by-numbers storytelling, it doesn't satify completely.  Hell, I thought old Del (the Cajun convict) was friggin' innocent!!!  And who except Satan-worshipping parents would name their child ""Percy Wetmore""?!  Christ, did they WANT kids to constantly kick the crap out of him as he grew up?!  By the end, I couldn't believe a word of this story.<br/><br/>Stephen King needs to learn to start mixing his paints.  His storytelling reeks of a child's ability to use crayons and a coloring book.  He always uses solid colors and stays within the lines.  Black mixed with white makes gray, Stephen!  People in the real world are gray!  There are no absolutes!!!  Start writing for a sophisticated audience and not like a two-bit hack cranking out Depression-era movie serial westerns!  The Fred Astaire movie ""Top Hat"" had more basis in the real world than this shell of a story."

"Swampfox","Null","0","1","12 December 1999"," Sophomore Curse Strikes Again.
","Very few filmmakers can dodge the cinematic equivalent of the Sword of Damocles, the sophomore curse. It basically says that the second film the director of a critical or box office success will in all likelihood suck (no one said it was literary). Paul Brickman was supposedly so afraid of it that it took him six years following ""Risky Business"" to give us ""Men Don't Leave"" which proved he had a lot to fear (and hasn't directed since, only writing lame fare such as ""True Crime""). The most notable exception, and remember the exceptions prove the rule boys and girls, is Quentin Tarantino. His sophomore effort was ""Pulp Fiction."" Frank Darabont isn't so lucky. (Nitpickers please note: while Darabont has indeeded directed before ""Shawshank,"" those were TV productions and not studio releases to which the ""curse"" applies)<br/><br/>Like ""Resevoir Dogs,"" ""The Shawshank Redemption"" didn't really find it's audience until hitting video and cable. As a collector of laser discs, I can tell when a movie has reached certain plateau of being a cherished experience for viewers: when I can't find used copies. I can't recall ever seeing a ""Shawshank"" in the used bin. Darabont has stored up a lot of goodwill over his debut and it was a shame to have to watch him waste it over three hours in a theater the other night. And waste it he does in the bloated, plodding and tired ""The Green Mile."" I would like to thank him for one thing: thank you, THANK YOU, for keeping the article in the title. Too bad his ""Shawshank"" star Robbins didn't do the same for ""Cradle Will Rock.""<br/><br/>If another movie is opening this winter with more goodwill towards its success I'd be hard pressed to name it. Tom Hanks! Stephen King! The same dude behind ""Shawshank!"" Talk about cutting a broad swath across a potential audience pool. One wants to like this movie. Which is why it will take a few days to a week for many to realize that ""The Green Mile"" has fallen victim to the curse. For some the moment might not come until six months from now when they are perusing the ""New Releases"" section and find they can easily skip over a second viewing of this disappointment.<br/><br/>The movie stumbles from the opening frame, first with a posse that pretty much looks like what they are - a bunch of extras in hillbilly overalls. Then Darabont makes the same mistake ""Saving Private Ryan"" did with a wholly unneeded present day bookend device that adds not one iota to our understanding of the film. What lies between is an even bigger letdown. For one thing, Tom Hanks manages a reversal of the usual disparity between an actor's age and that of the characters by actually looking younger than the 44 his Paul Edgecombe is supposed to be. Hanks also looks a bit miscast as head guard for the squad that keeps the peace on death row. As arguably the most bankable star of today, Hanks is prone to the occasional miscasting for those whose memories don't go back across the gulf of time to ""The Bonfire of the Vanities.""  <br/><br/>Missing from ""Mile"" is ""Shawshank's"" unerring cinematography and production design. While some scenes set in Edgecombe's house, especially the kitchen, were windows to a time most of us have never seen, others just didn't have that verisimilitude the milieus in Shawshank afforded. Here's a movie set in Louisiana that rarely has characters sweating. I will give Darabont a lot of credit by not ducking the racial overtones of his period, however. Anyone who thinks it's racist for a 1930's black prisoner is defer to his guard as ""Yessum, boss""  must have studied their history from the same book that sells the Utopian version of the 50's everyone wanted Reagan to bring back. Another element of woeful inadequacy was the score. For a film like this to succeed in selling the aura of miraculousness, an uplifting and powerful score goes a long way in helping to get across the wonder of what we see. Which is ""The Green Mile's"" biggest stumble, this inability to make one in awe of John Coffey's healing power.<br/><br/>Not trimming this movie from it's 188 minute running time was writer/director Darabont's worse decision. Jettisoning the unneeded bookend would have saved 20 minutes right off the bat. Deciding that he was making a movie about miracles in a prison and not the evils of capital punishment by electrocution could have saved another 15 to 25, especially the hammy scenes with Harry Dean Stanton rehearsing the condemned men's last steps. Overall, the film needed tightening as every scene dragged on killing whatever momentum it had built up for the film as a whole. Darabont's not the only director to have gone this bloated route lately. Perhaps someone should circulate a memo on how and why a film should run past the customary 120 minutes or less. I could suggest a film to watch, one I happen to see this week - ""The Right Stuff."" There's' a movie that needs 3 hours or so to tell its story. Sure, you could cut out all the Chuck Yeager stuff and save about an hour. But without Yeager, it would loose it's heart and soul. Even in 188 minutes, ""The Green Mile"" never seems to find its."
"fcjim","Null","0","1","30 June 2000"," Warning Track Power
","In the baseball world, a hard-hit ball that barely misses being a home run is referred to as having ""warning track power;"" that is, another foot or so and it would have been out of the park, but as it is, it's just another out. That's the most to-the-point review I can give for ""The Green Mile,"" a film which has all the right pieces, but still comes up about a foot short.<br/><br/>The reason for my disappointment of the film is a simple one, but I'll start off by praising it... there are truly a lot of great things about this movie.  The entire cast is excellent; in fact, I can't name a single miscast or inadequate actor in the entire film.  As good as Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan are in the lead roles, the supporting roles of Brutal (an exceptional performance by David Morse), Warden Moores (Cromwell), guards Dean Stanton (Pepper) and the hateful Percy Whitmore (Hutchinson), as well as all of the prisoners (Graham Greene, Michael Jeter, and Sam Rockwell) are just as impressive.  Even very minor characters, such as Edgecomb's wife and Coffey's lawyer, are exceptionally well cast and acted -- this is a film in which every actor takes his or her precious few lines and makes them count. Not one actor is wasted in his or her role in this film.<br/><br/>Secondly, Darabont's direction, and the photography of the film overall, are also excellent.  This is a long film in which very little actually happens, yet Darabont makes an easy to watch and enjoyable story out of it, and thus creates one of the fastest-feeling 3-hour films I have ever seen.  Rarely will Darabont surprise his viewer with an ""oh-wow"" shot, a-la Kubrick -- rather, he allows the story to unfold at a perfect pace, and it is a delight to watch.  Many seem to criticize the supernatural element that the film includes, but it is presented so carefully and slowly that, to me, as amazing as it was, it seemed to flow right into the story that was being told.<br/><br/>So what's the problem with this film?  Easy: the ending is an awfully written and conceived, tacked-on, ham-fisted piece of junk.  This is a three-hour film which attempts to wrap up another hour's worth of loose ends in the final ten minutes, using my least favorite screenwriter's tool, the Old Man Bookending His Story sequence.  The story of ""The Green Mile"" ended with the film's final execution (there are three executions, one of which, for the squeamish, is one of the most horrifying scenes ever committed to film... don't let your kids watch it!) -- why didn't the director end the film there?  <br/><br/>Why must so many films today leave so little for the audience to figure out for themselves?  Darabont could have opened the movie with a scene of Edgecomb playing with a mouse, and let the audience figure it out on their own on the way home, but no!  He had to take a perfectly paced film and bolt on a quick & easy explanation for everything.  Do yourself a favor... watch ""The Green Mile,"" but turn it off as soon as the 'flashback' ends.  Let it settle in for a day or so, then watch the end to see what you are ""missing."" That way, hopefully, your impression of the film won't be crushed, as mine was, by the ending."

""Green Mile"" manages to inspire and devastate at the same time.

","If there were only one film I could see for the rest of my life, it would definitely, without a doubt, be The Green Mile.  Being an avid fan of The Shawshank Redemption and Stephen King, I really wanted to see this movie and was so glad when I did.  Never before have I been so deeply touched by a movie because this story is so real and so remarkably believable. After I saw the movie, I read the novel.  The book and the movie are almost exactly the same and the casting for the movie was absolutely perfect. The best performances in the film were those by David Morse (I loved his character and I'm a big fan of his) and Michael Clarke Duncan, who didn't just play John Coffey but became him. If you're afraid of the long running time of a little past three hours, don't be.  You don't even notice the time lapse, and that signifies a good film.  Be prepared to experience a film that gives a deep, beautiful insight into human emotion but is still real enough to make you laugh.  I love American Beauty, but this film should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1999, but at any rate, it's still my number one film."

The supporting prison characters, both prisoner and guard are top-notch. Michael Clark Duncan who plays John Coffey, a prisoner who can perform healing miracles(note the initals J.C.) gave about as good a performance as I'd seen last year.

It is a really good movie, no doubt about that, but it isn't very original. Looks a lot like Shawshank Redemption. But it is not as good. It is long but you don't feel the hours pass by. No problem there. The biggest problem with this movie is that while it as not many problems, it is not an exceptional movie. Just a very good one.

I read the set of six novellas by King when they first came out in monthly installments and absolutely loved them-- and normally, I'm not a huge King fan.

The screenplay was a faithful adaption of the original book, which is something most movies-made-from-books can't say. Frank Darabont did a wonderful job directing as well.<br/><br/>Then there's the acting. Being an actor myself, I tend to analyze performances. This was one ensemble cast where everyone had something good to do and all did it well. It seemed as though the part of Paul Edgecomb was written for Tom Hanks, and Michael Clark Duncan was amazing as John Coffey. Doug Hutchison I had only previously seen as the memorable Victor Eugene Tooms in two episodes of the early seasons of The X-Files, and the portrayal of the sadistic guard Percy was a wonderful surprise. I don't often express emotion at movies, but Percy was made so real that I really felt like wringing his slimy little neck. The other guards, played by David Morse, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Barry Pepper also get kudos for their acting, as do James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, Michael Jeter, and just about everyone else in the cast.

","I don't usually recommend a movie from Hollywood to people who are either spiritually aware or are thinking about spiritual things. However yesterday I went to watch an excellent film called ""The Green Mile"". I won't say too much about it but read on.......<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was really realistic and very down to earth. What could of turn out to be another 'Shawshank Redemption' actually was one of the best prison type movies I have ever seen!<br/><br/>The basic story sounds like it going to be a violent prison film about a man who has raped then killed two small girls (aged 8). However the movie had a lot more than just that! The key elements that makes this movie so great are: 1) You really start caring for some of the characters that are on death row awaiting to die on the electric chair. Has anyone ever done missionary work within a prison. Then you will know what I mean? 2) The christian element in this movie added a dimension so lacking in the Shawshank Redemption. It's amazing how many people meet spiritual awareness in this environment in reality in America! 3) It shows that even when God gives you a spiritual gift it is how you use it to help others that really counts. 4) The movie shows that a spiritual gift can be a burden more than a status symbol. 5) The movie is also about ageism and what people think about when they reach to a good old age. In this respect it was similar to ""The Straight Story"" which I highly reccommend as well.<br/><br/>The little bits of sexual scenes were good as well! Personally, I think that with most modern movies they treat sex in the wrong context, have this just added to the picture's quality. However I was very pleased with these scenes because it was in context of HOW God wants sex to be like i.e. within marriage!<br/><br/>I also loved Duncan Clarke and he should win best supporting role in the oscars!<br/><br/>This prison movie was really thought-provoking and went beyond the stereotypical lines of preaching to people and really made me and my friend think about our own lives.<br/><br/>There is a very nasty scene during the movie (perhaps the most horrible I have ever seen), but this just added to the drama and the knowledge that killing people is often wrong as two wrongs do not make a right; and often enough it is people in power that are the evil ones who pick on the poor and lonely.<br/><br/>In conclusion, YOU MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW. Tell me what you think and how much did it changed your view about how God sees real criminals trapped on death row in America!<br/><br/>RATINGS Direction = 80% Effective throughout with peeks into the past.<br/><br/>Acting = 93% All the characters are well acted, especially Duncan Clarke!!!<br/><br/>Music = 92% Adds to the atmosphere greatly.<br/><br/>Sound + 85% Brilliant spot effects to create a prison environment. totally convincing when 'Old Sparky' is alive and working - really scary!<br/><br/>Horrible scenes and words = 83% The love scenes were fine because it was in context and was part of the plot! The violence was expected considering it's a realistic almost documentary style prison drama, however it was not there just to be fantasical. The movie also contain the most horrible scene ever in any film I have ever seen - so beware!!!<br/><br/>Editing = 50% This is the weakest part of the film. The beginning should have be shorter, but the next two hours was a milestone in capturing your attention.<br/><br/>Plot = 90% Designed for Christians and non-Christians alike. A rare movie that isn't peachy or preaching, but has the subtly to make you think!<br/><br/>Hookability = 61% The long introduction makes you want the film to end soon. You may get confused whether this is a comedy or not!<br/><br/>Lastability = 96% Once you see a miracle, then every minute of this get better and better and you won't want the movie to end.<br/><br/>Overall = 90% Perhaps the greatest prison drama ever!

","So, after a five year exodus from our screens, Frank Darabont returns with, as we all know by now, another Stephen King adaptation, the serialised ""Green Mile"". It was sadly inevitable that the furore prior to the films showing would be whether it would hold ground alongside the much plauded ""Shawshank Redemption"", an obvious comparison given the circumstances and scenarios of the two films. For me personally, this is wrong as to expect to replicate the emotion that flowed from Shawshank, given the same context and setting is highly unfair. The Green Mile, based upon the lives of the wardens of Cold Mountain Penitentiary circa 1935, focuses not upon the relationships of the inmates, but the experiences of one particular ward head, Paul Edgecombe (Tom Hanks). The arrival of John Coffey, portrayed marvellously well by oscar nominee Michael Clarke Duncan, sparks a chain of supernatural events that impact upon the prisons residents, and lead to quite sobering consequences come curtain fall. The key to this film is to remember that the whole outline has been painted by King, and the manner of the story, in it's constituent parts, seems to have forced Darabont's hand in many ways, possibly explaining the sequence of events and it's chronological pattern. It is indeed clear from the chain of events that the novel upon which the story is based was very much that of a Dickensian serial form which does stifle the films ability to digress and fool the viewer. Where Darabont succeeds however is in providing moments of raw tension and shock even under these constrained conditions. True to the novel, but also with a distinct Darabont influence. There can be no complaints with the acting,(especially that of David Morse who regularly excels), and do not let the length put you off either. The story, and the manner of its conveyance is stylishly smooth and true to the novel and both demands and deserves your time. The morality of the human soul, religion and the supernatural are all factors which revolve and continuously force you to appreciate their position in the film. Whether the form in which Coffey displays this talent is necessary is debatable, but what isn't is the magnificent craft the director possesses for transforming page to screen. This is the second time he has successfully brought a King novel to life, which is not as easy as it sounds, and unravelled a tale of distinct cinematic quality. The lack of true depth to the story and characters no doubt costs this film the status of classic, but that is by no means of detriment to Darabont who has made what he can of an unyielding tale. By no means another Shawshank, but then that was never proposed or promised, and you do get treated to some of the most tension filled hours you will have seen on the big screen for some time. Now comes the time for this talented director to jump ship, and deservedly mould a modern classic novel into no doubt another modern classic piece of cinema. Yes, the quality Shawshank possessed is slightly lacking, but there is do not doubt it is capable of returning. The stage is set for Darabont's next project ""The Bijou"". The cinema going public are waiting and there for the taking.<br/><br/>The Green Mile: **** (out of five)"

","One reason we tolerate watching 3 or 4 bad movies in a row is that eventually we get to see a good one come out of nowhere and hit us in the face. The green mile is such a film. Based on a Stephen King serial,arn't they all, the story is set in a Louisiana prison during the depression. It revolves around the head guard of an execution detail named Paul Edgecumb(Hanks). Paul is a good and kindly character as are most of the members of his team, bar one.They are conscious of their roles and professional duties and are anxious that their charges, for the brief time they are with them should be relieved of as much stress as possible prior to their execution. Not a scenario one would expect in a southern prison of the 1930's but there you are.Despite their serious duties there is always some welcome levity and on occasion they can be heavy handed when the need arises.Which they do several times with a recalcitrant prisoner to the audiences laughing approval. One day the arrival of a new prisoner arouses everyones curiosity. John Coffey is a black man condemned to death and he is enormous but everyones initial nervousness by his size is waylaid by his child like innocence, his fear of the dark and quiet disposition.Then later on in the prison block stange things start to happen...<br/><br/>Some of the material was unadulterated soppy tear jerker sentimental and contrived, and I loved it. I sympathised with the prison guards for all their grisley work and wonder how they manage to keep it together in such a place. The casting was just right even to the role of Percy the one sociopathic prison guard.Bonnie Hunt noticably gets better in each role,less hair brained.The question never arises in the movie about the origin of these miraculous powers and why they happened to reside in this particular person. I reckon to have gone into such detail would have spoilt the story.I guess its all a matter of faith. I rated this movie an 8/10. I didnt mind the length and believe the subject theme warranted it.

Last time I felt something like this was right after I watched Gregg Araki's ""The Doom Generation"" (and ""Nowhere"").<br/><br/>The quality of ""The Green Mile"" is not surprising at all since it's been proven that Frank Darabont, given a good story to work with and professional, experienced actors, can make a truly magical piece of art. He did it last with ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and ""The Green Mile"" seems very similar to it, only I thought it a little better. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" didn't make my eyes moist like this one did.<br/><br/>Some might find the film a bit long. Like my dad said - they could have spared us some details and make it just two hours instead of two and a half, but I believe it only made the climax more intense.<br/><br/>I hate any kind of spoilers, and so I won't discuss the plot.. but I would strongly recommend this to any person that is emotional.

I often wonder what Stephen King is thinking when he writes as he has given us such great horror/thrillers but also gave us The Shawshank Redemption which Frank Darabont also directed. I believe he prepared himself for this film by doing Shawshank as I prepared myself for watching it by seeing Shawshank. What an excellent story and an excellent cast.

All the guards (save one) are essentially good-hearted, laid-back, and a little too generally relaxed for their occupation.  None of the inmates (again, save one) seem to deserve to be there.  It's a happy-go-lucky environment where they occasionally execute somebody.  What a statement (though, I do give the movie credit for at least treating the executions themselves seriously).<br/><br/>And the mouse - goodness, the mouse.  I'm sorry, but I find cute, little rodents to be out of place in serious drama.  For the purposes of this film, I guess it's supposed to illustrate the humanity of one of the inmates, but it comes off as a cheap attempt to try and manipulate the audience into some kind of ""Aw, Shucks"" mindset.<br/><br/>Not that The Green Mile is a bad movie, but it is nothing more than a mediocre, functional film elevated only by a fantastic performance from Michael Clarke Duncan (receiving the only Oscar nomination I think this movie warrants).

","If you are a true Stephen King fan, and read the book before you saw the movie, I feel that it is safe to say that you are one of the 44.4% (at the time of this review, anyway) of voters who gave the Green Mile 10 stars. I have seen virtually every single one of Stephen King's films and have read roughly 30 of his novels, and I think that The Green Mile was by far the best screen adaptation of any of his books, as well as one of the most intellectual and thought provoking stories.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is an incredible actor, and he played a very convincing supervisory prison guard. The fact that the film was so long gave the audience an excellent opportunity to see what kinds of people the characters are. By the end of the film, you KNOW those guys, and that is one of the most important aspects of filmmaking as a whole. The audience needs to feel a connection with the characters, they need to care about them. It is heartbreaking to see Tom Hanks' character Paul Edgecomb in such pain because of his urinary infection, and when John Coffey cures it, you feel so grateful for it that it may as well have been your own infection. That is the kind of thing that makes a film like this so great. It appealed to the King fans because of the relatively brief but satisfactory violence, but it also appealed to the kinds of people who want to see a good story unfold when they watch a movie.<br/><br/>The Green Mile is not a film to be overlooked. Stephen King is now officially proving that although the majority of his films fit firmly in the genre of horror (with the exception of other great films like Dolores Claiborne and The Shawshank Redemption), he is more than capable of creating a truly touching and entertaining movie without relying even a little bit on gratuitous sex or violence or profanity or gore or blood or monsters..."

The film follows Paul Edgecombe, a death row prison guard in a 1930's southern prison who discovers one of the inmates, John Coffey, a convicted child murderer/rapist, isn't who he appears to be. He's a gentle giant, afraid of the dark who has a mysterious healing power and is a miracle of God. The performances are 100% in the can.

","Like a languorous three hour episode of 'Amazing Stories', the Green Mile may be the nicest film about death row to hit the screens in a while. The Green Mile has a good cast and many entertaining scenes but without an essential spark or meaning that elevates it above a cartoon-like fantasy. It's predictable. Without the broad insertion of the magical elements (hence my 'Amazing Stories' reference) 'The Green Mile' would be a very bland prison movie indeed. Part of the problem is in the characterizations. Although fronted by a formidable cast (David Morse, James Cromwell, Harry Dean Stanton and Gary Sinise have *bit* roles), there is nary an interesting character among them. The Green Mile world is so pat that it's hard to bat an eyelash when Coffey begins demonstrating his magical powers (which of course he is too simple-minded to understand). Before you can say 'Escape from Witch Mountain', Coffey is amazing Death Row by curing Hanks of a urinary infection and empathically predicting events.

I salute the director, producer, and film company for being daring enough to release the film in its entirety, a move that likely cost it some box office dollars (many people are not willing to sit through such a long movie, plus the length limits the number of showings a day).<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Michael Duncan are brilliant.

It's trying to reach out and touch the viewer. And it may, in many cases, do just that. But it didn't for me, and here's why - the story is one that is *deeply* about religion. John Coffey parallels Jesus Christ (same initials, too - how convenient) and this I found to be awkward. I happen to be an athiest, and while I don't mind people talking about God or their belief in Him, I dislike it when people try to push their view on me. I got the impression like it was trying to be forced, like the movie was attempting to instill faith in its viewers. It just didn't work for me.<br/><br/>What's the bottom line? The movie is good.

","""The Green Mile"" ranks as one of the magical masterpieces that has ever been made. ""The Green Mile"" is at the top of my favorites list along with ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Titanic,"" and ""Meet Joe Black."" While Tom Hanks is at his best as Paul Edgecomb, it is David Morse steps out from and center as Brutal who steals the show. I have watched Morse since he had been in ""Contact"" and then in ""The Negotiator"" and my conclusion is that he is an actor whose presence is felt immediately upon entering a scene and don't want to see him leave. The only thing I did not like about this film was 30 minutes longer than it needed to be. For example, the first 30 minutes should have been edited out because I feel it had nothing to do with the rest of the film. Michael Clarke Duncan's performance as John Coffey, a man filled with hope and miracles, blew me away since it showed how much talent this giant of a young actor really has. Duncan's performance was touching and the best of his career. The plot of this movie is really good because it really does give human faces to the prison guards who have the toughest job of all, which is guarding death row. This has the best ensemble cast of 1999 as well as the best of the year in my opinion. Miracles certainly happen when Tom Hanks appears on screen; first in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and again in ""The Green Mile."""

I think this is the best movie I have seen since Sling Blade. In many ways it is similar to Sling Blade, but The Green Mile is even more powerful and emotional. Through the entire movie, I was totally absorbed in what was going on. It was the shortest 3 hour movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away any of the plot, so I will make it brief. Steven King is a genius, pure and simple. This movie proves that. EVERYONE should see this movie and hear the message that it communicates.

","""The Green Mile"" is a three-hour-long movie adapted from a Stephen King book. Its director is the same as that of ""The Shawshank Redemption"", another Stephen King book adaptation to which it is often compared. I went to see it hoping for an experience something like ""Shawshank"", in my opinion one of the best films of the past ten years.<br/><br/>Although Tom Hanks and the others do an intense and convincing job in their roles - the three women characters are especially interesting - the movie is much more creepy thriller than uplifting-human-spirit-movie, as some reviews led me to believe. The film is full of graphic and grisly violence, and the tone is almost strictly edgy and dark throughout. There is an abundance of intense evil - not just in the stories of some of the death-row prisoners, but especially in the character of Percy.<br/><br/>This is a story about a death row cellblock, and it would be hard to avoid showing us the darkest side of human beings. However, I believe that good art should also show us the possibility of redeeming the evil, and there is no real redemption here. Tom Hanks' character is admirable, but never really accomplishes much that matters beyond avoiding being a bad person.<br/><br/>Three hours is too long for me to sit watching a psychic-powers thriller with torture scenes. There were one or two joyful moments, but they were very rare - I felt I'd forgotten how to smile when the credits came down.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a movie which makes a point about capital punishment, about prisons, or about spiritual healing, this is not it. Neither does it find truth or beauty or goodness in the midst of evil. It's mostly creepy and disturbing. I'd suggest staying home and reading instead."

My biggest complaint is by far the ending. This is a dark and depressing movie that leaves you with no sense of completion.

","The Green Mile is a picture about miracles which comes up one miracle short. John Coffey, a simple man with supernatural talents comes up with miracles for all whom he is called upon to help... except himself. Wrongfully convicted of an unspeakable murder, one keeps hoping for a better ending,<br/><br/>though perhaps, as we get to know him, we come to agree with his own assessment that this end is only merciful. His obvious talent for healing is mixed with the subtler, and ultimately more torturous ability to see into the souls of others, no matter how dark the vision may be.<br/><br/>Yet, if that were all there was to this picture, it would be a simplistic story, more worthy of a half hour run on the Twilight Zone than a 3 hour movie. The development and interplay of characters is what cunningly blinds you to the passing of time as you watch it. There is a tinge of mystery in the beginning, an unexpectedly emotional reaction to an old film which waits until nearly the end for its explanation. While you seek it, you meet characters who evoke a range of emotions from respect to sympathy, and in a couple cases disgust. You cannot quite say that each of these receives precisely as he deserves, for this would not be so, but then, it is not so in life too many times either. There are a few surprise twists, and even once the<br/><br/>initial mystery from the beginning is solved, there is still a slight twist at the end, as if to remind you who wrote this tale.<br/><br/>There are tiny elements from time to time that seem incongruous to the time frame of the plot, but on the whole, so minor that unless you go through it looking for them, you'll likely never notice. On the whole, The Green Mile is by and large the best picture this year. If this one doesn't take awards, the awards are an empty exercise."

There is no doubt that much of the impact of this movie is due to the genius and talent of Stephen King, but the actors bring King's characters to life in a thoughtful, creative fashion.

","**Warning: the following contains important plot revelations for The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption. Please watch both films before reading my statement**<br/><br/>You may think I am describing one movie here. In fact, I am describing two:<br/><br/>A man, falsely accused of a double murder but who was really in the wrong place at the wrong time, is sentenced to a prison in the early part of the twentieth century. There, he meets a man with whom one of the most beautiful friendships in the history of film is started. Alongside this central theme are many other interesting characters and subplots-the brutal prisoners, the guards, a benevolent old convict who befriends an animal and who dies halfway through the movie, and the antagonist: a prison employee who is diabolical to the extreme and who gets what he deserves in the end. Near the end of the movie, there is a plot twist where another prisoner (with bad teeth and an annoying laugh) is shown to be the killer of the two victims whose deaths were previously blamed on the innocent. There are disturbing scenes of violence, moments of tearful happiness, and actions that make you stunned with anger. Also, a classic movie connects the beginning of the film with the end.<br/><br/>The movie is long, but you don't care; it is an epic, heroic tale written by Stephen King (who usually never bothers to assign value to humanity), directed by Frank Darabont, and scored by the talented Thomas Newman.<br/><br/>At the end, however, the two films split into polar opposites. One is, in my opinion, the best ending to a film I've ever seen; the other is the worst.<br/><br/>Yes, The Green Mile is The Shawshank Redemption gone bad. Stealing virtually the same plot from the first film, King reprises the story to fit his usual existentialist style: giving no pardon at all for the wronged and leading us to ponder the ""meaninglessness and hopelessness"" of our own lives.<br/><br/>King has taken Shawshank Redemption and expunged redemption. In Shawshank, King presents hope and redemption as powerful, valuable commodities in life. However, in TGM, both emotions fail to show and we are left with a manic-depressant movie after which we end up feeling that hope always looses out.<br/><br/>Andy wrote in SR, ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things."" What happened to that spirit, Mr. King?<br/><br/>Objectively, it is an interesting philosophic exercise to compare and contrast the two films: despite their being nearly identical in setup, Shawshank Redemption ultimately is the most optimistic film you'll ever see while The Green Mile is the most pessimistic.<br/><br/>I give this film 5 stars out of ten, but this rating doesn't mean I think it is an average film. Perfectly acted, directed, scored, and told, (like Shawshank), TGM is an extraordinary film destroyed in the end by Stephen King's uninspiring philosophy of life.<br/><br/>After viewing the rotten ending of the Green Mile, it's hard to remind oneself that it came from the same author of the Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>As for the end monologue, I'm sorry, Mr. King, but most of us feel that our lives are more than just ""walking the green mile."" Hearing the old man drone on about how terrible life is made me want to scream Andy's famous line from Shawshank Redemption:<br/><br/>""Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'.""<br/><br/>*****/(out of ten)"

","The Green Mile joins Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, Stand By Me, Misery, The Dead Zone and (in my opinion) TV movies The Langoliers and The Stand as one of the best adaptations by King.  And taking a look at some of the directors that made these films, you will see a pattern.  Now I have no idea who directed The Langoliers or The Stand but I can certainly tell you that the likes of David Cronenberg, Rob Reiner, Stanley Kubrick and Frank Darabont are responsible for the other films mentioned above.  It takes good directors that have great vision to bring to life Stephen King's world.  And now with Darabont directing this one you can add it to the list of superbly adapted King tales.  <br/><br/>As a book, the Green Mile was vivid and touching and awe inspiring, and to be honest, I wasn't sure how the film was going to turn out when I heard it was going to be made.  Even though I have great admiration for Tom Hanks and Darabont, that alone did not make me overly enthusiastic about the movie. But to be completely honest, when I found out that John Coffey was going to be played by Michael Duncan Clarke, my mood soon changed.  Clarke is one of only two men that I could envision playing the pivitol role in the film ( the other being Tiny Lister ).  But Clarke takes the role of John Coffey and breathes life into him.  He gives him an identity and he is so likable and believable that the movie works because of him.  His interpretation of John Coffey is exactly like I imagined him when I read the Green Mile some six months ago.  The rest of the cast is great but it is Clarke that shines the brightest and that is quite the compliment seeing as some of his co-stars are Tom Hanks, the under rated David Morse and even bit roles by Graham Greene, Gary Sinise and a hilarious cameo by Harry Dean Stanton as Old Toot Toot are great performances.  It is actually quite intersting to see Harry Dean Stanton in here because one of the death row guards is named Dean Stanton, I wonder if King wrote that character in homage of the great actor?<br/><br/>There is so much to like about The Green Mile and it is a film that should be seen by everyone at least once.  It is entertaining, comedic and inspiring all rolled into one film.  It is one of the best films of the year but again, as I have said in every positive film review so far this year after American Beauty came out, it is good but it pales in comparison to AB. It will probably garner some well deserved Oscar nominations but I don't think it should win any of them except for best supporting actor, and even then I think Clarke will be in tough against Wes Bentley, if he gets a nod.<br/><br/>The Green Mile is a great experience and it is not only a great film from an artistic standpoint but on an entertainment level it is terrific as well.<br/><br/>8 1/2 out of 10"

","Frank Darabont brings Stephen King's novel to life. It stays true to the book and will hold your interest the whole three hours running time. Tom Hanks is a prison guard that befriends one giant of a prisoner played by Michael Duncan. Amazing things begin to happen on the ""Green Mile"" leading to execution on death row. Also turning in stunning performances are Michael Jeter, Harry Dean Stanton and Sam Rockwell. This drama has it's humorous moments. This is a dark and moody tale that is Oscar worthy."

","This film may be even be more moving than The Shawshank Redemption.  Just... the depth of human soul shown in here is just unparalleled.  During its three hour or so length, you are immersed in it, completely immersed.  Go see it, I urge you, and read as little as possible about it beforehand, for that will make its unpredictability all the more effective.  I mean it- don't even read the ""plot summary""!  After seeing this, you will be reaching for something deeper in this world..."

","I'm not going to make any long comments on this incredible film. I can only say one thing, SEE IT!! a very moving poetic film that will have you teary eye and bewildered all at the same time. The Green Mile is one of the top 10 Films of 1999. If this movie doesn't get an Oscar Nomination the Academy should be hung and replaced. Just see it and enjoy. Nuff said!!"
"Doc_Who","10","0","1","24 December 1999"," Should get some possible nominations next year!!!great acting/actors!
","This movie should get some Oscar nominations next year. I love this movie, the cast is great as the story!!Some of my favorite actor star in this movie. There are Tom Hanks,David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell ,Micheal Jeter and Gary Sinise. I would actually write my review of this movie as I cannot really say how touching this movie is. It should get some notice because it's not the usual hollywood movie. It is a horror,comedy and drama(heavy) movie. Be sure to bring some tissues for the ending!!The only problem is there delated scenes left on the cutting room floor?I hope this movie gets nominated for some Oscars next year as it's my favorite of the 1999 fall season!!!"

","One of the best movie I saw in 1999.  If October Sky woke you up with it's sleeper approach in the theaters, The Green Mile will be your Christmas present under the tree.  Tom Hanks and the cast/crew bring together a piece of art seldom found on film.  Many thanks for giving us three hours of true entertainment."

","Why do IMDB voters shoot every new movie up the all time great list? According to you people 6 of the top 30 movies of all time have been released in the last year including: American Beauty, Being John Malkovich, Toy Story 2, The Sixth Sense, Fight Club, and now the Green Mile.<br/><br/>Sigh.<br/><br/>The movie was reasonably entertaining, especially the acting.  Hanks and Morse were all likable.  But it was too long, Mr. Jingles too cute, the exposition too Spielberg (think Saving Schindler's etc.)  Isn't anyone besides me tired of over long movies capping the story with a narrator on both sides to tell you what it means, just in case you are too stupid (as they clearly think you are) to figure it out from the film itself?<br/><br/>The saving grace is I know that as soon as some other ""B"" film is released next month (Stuart Little, anyone?) you people will shoot it up into the top ten and forget this flavor of the month."
"CrazyH","10","0","1","22 December 1999"," A Near Perfect Film, at least I think so!
","Usually before I take the time to write a short review, I read over the previous comments to get a general feel for what has been said already to avoid any repetition.  What struck me immediately was the love-it or hate-it view, with hardly anybody sitting on the fence.  I really can't understand the ones who hated it, but of course they are entitled to their opinion. I was mesmerized and at the films end said that I had just seen the best picture of 1999.  In fact, I would say that this was a near perfect film. Being a Stephen King fan, I read The Green Mile in its original serial installments, and remember marking each installments release date on my calendar, and buying each on its release date.  I was very pleased to hear that a film was being made, and that Tom Hanks would play Paul.  I even convinced my wife (not a Stephen King Fan) and daughter to read the books prior to last nights viewing. The 3+ hours, I didn't even notice them.  The near filled theatre was quiet, and riveted.  I did not notice much movement, or talking with the exception of the all to frequent cell phone interruption. The casting and acting, again near perfect.  I cannot think of an alternate actor to play any of the parts that would have been better.  It was great to see David Morse, Bonnie Hunt and Harry Dean Stanton.  Gary Sinise, although with very little screen time, leaves a lasting impression on the Depression era mentality (morality). Like I said at the beginning, a near perfect film with a mix of suspense, humor, and spiritualism.  I can already see Billy Crystal doing the ""water closet"" scene during his best film montage at the Oscar's."
"EmrldGuy","10","0","1","21 December 1999"," Superb Film
","I saw this movie while in Florida on vacation with my girlfriend.  We really hadn't heard anything at the time about, and had no idea what to expect. Well, it's my favorite movie of the year probably.  The movie is an emotional roller coaster with superb acting and decent cinematography in a not so cooperative environment (prison).  Hanks, Duncan, & Sinise were all great.  I am not a King reader, so I can not compare book to film as may do. Why even compare?  I think this movie does all a movie is supposed to do. It moves you! Makes you think!  Overall, I loved it!"
"ofgods","6","0","1","21 December 1999"," You got me on why this movie is critically acclaimed...
","Upon reading that Tom Hanks was in another ""Oscar"" worthy movie, I decided I needed to see it.  This was four months ago.  This much oscar hype about a movie should have tipped as to how boring this movie would be.  Not since the ""English Patient"" have I been this bored with a movie.  Using that formula, I guess ""The Green Mile"" will win 9 Oscars. I'm not really sure what exactly bores me about this movie, but I'm pretty certain I can pinpoint it to the mouse ""Mr. Jingles"".  This mouse takes over way too much of the movie (precisely 1 hr of the movie is the guards chasing the mouse and it's relationship with the inmate played by Michael Jeter).  I have never read the book by Stephen King, but it has been pointed out to me that the mouse plays a much more important role in the book.  The book explores the relationship between John Coffey(whose initials, ironically, are J.C.).  If Durabont would have done this, the movie would have been four hours. There is nothing special about the acting here.  Tom Hanks does not, I repeat, DOES NOT deserve an Oscar for this picture.  It's nothing I haven't seen before by Hanks. Edgecomb is a combination of his ""Saving Private Ryan"" character and ""Forrest Gump.""  The one actor that does have a breakout performance is Michael Duncan Clarke.  His portrayal of John Coffey is the one reason I didn't walk out half way through the movie. If you have three hours on hand and want to watch a movie about a mouse, go watch ""Stuart Little"" twice."

"lou-50","Null","0","1","21 December 1999"," Like the drink, only not spelled the same way
","A black man, sitting on a riverbank, wails loudly that he was too late to save them as he holds two limp, white little girls, one on each of his mighty arms.  Much later in the movie, he calmly says that they were killed because of their love.  In between these scenes we learn much about John Coffey and the Deep South in the brilliant yet faulty film, ""The Green Mile"".  Stephen King's serial novel has been brought to screen with the same searing portrayal of racial bigotry as ""Places in the Heart"", with the same realism and critique of capital punishment as ""Dead Man Walking"", and with the added supernatural elements that are hallmark to Stephen King's works. Yet ""The Green Mile"" is a long film (over three hours) that loses its special significance when it goes off focus.  Why spend an inordinate time dealing with Paul Edgecombe's urinary tract infection, why go overboard with detailing Mr. Jingles, and why does Percy, the sadist guard, seem to have as much screen presence as John Coffey?  The real story should be between Edgecombe and Coffey and yet there are too many distracting things in their way.  To the film's credit, when it does spend time with racial prejudices, it spares no one.  The arresting scene between Edgecombe and the lawyer defending Coffey (played by Gary Sinise), in which black people are compared to dogs that don't know any better, explains much about Southern philosophy. When Coffey is called upon the save the warden's wife, a remarkable change of events occur from the cold, initial reception to the final warm enlightenment.  When Edgecombe confronts his terrible guilt with Coffey, their   commiseration is both tearful and heart wrenching.  ""The Green Mile"" is blest with veteran actors playing their roles naturally and securely, from Tom Hanks to Michael Clark Duncan to David Morse to Bonnie Hunt to James Cromwell.  ""The Green Mile"" is a good but not great movie because it, ironically, tried to be too faithful to the novel.  Better if it had focused more on the special relationship between Edgecombe and the man who could save others but not himself."

","There have been many Stephen King movies. This is the best adaption of a Stephen King novel I have seen. A great story, great acting and a great movie. We can all learn from its message. The allegory of Christ is a theme that turns up throughout S.K.'s library of fiction."
"ladysolo","10","0","1","20 December 1999"," Beautiful, brilliant
","Stephen King is a poet.  I read the book several months ago and fell in love with his style of writing and his way of stringing words together to create imagery.  I doubted any movie could do the book justice, but this movie proved me wrong.  It was absolutely perfect!  Most of the characters and sets were exactly as I pictured them, and every single actor delivered a stirring and believable performance, from Michael Duncan as Coffey down to the mice they used for Mr. Jingles.  Tom Hanks isn't my favorite actor, but his work in this film amazed me and moved me.<br/><br/>Frank Darabont is to be applauded on this wonderful success.  This movie deals with sensitive issues but he presented them with tact.<br/><br/>If the academy can scrape together some of its dignity after snubbing Shawshank, they should award this film Best Picture of the year, for that is what I think it is.  Many great movies have hit the theatres this year, but none have been so artistically brilliant or as deeply moving as this movie. I have never cried so hard in a movie in my life!  That is saying a lot...<br/><br/>Wonderful.  Bravo!"

","The Green Mile truly surprised me.  I expected next to nothing from this flick, having heard minimal reviews.  The 3 Hour + Timeframe made me skeptical, but oh my, did it ever deliver. Tom Hanks gave an exceptional performance as usual, but the true star was that of Michael Duncan (John Coffey).  He delivered a surprisingly convincing performance and truly gave impact to the emotional role in which he was cast.  A must see this Holiday Season."
"screll","5","0","3","16 December 1999"," bloated and overdone
","I can only dictate in so many words how disappointing this childish film is. It is so blatant with its characters and plot line that one can see every twist(if you want to call them that) 20 miles and 40 minutes ahead.  All the cinematography, character development and artistic relevancy of ""Shawshank"" is missing here.  The storytelling is slow, the humor is forced and cheesey, while at the same time the movie feels as though it has something important to say...but what?  I am not some anti-sentimentalist...I did tear up at one point, but I also do at long-distance phone commercials, and I consider neither art. It is not bad in the way Armageddon was bad, but it left me confused with its hoaky approach.  Comparing this film with ""Shawshank"" is a joke."
"pooch-8","Null","0","2","14 December 1999"," Second King period prison flick from Darabont no Shawshank
","Despite some terrific performances (particularly from supporters David Morse and Michael Jeter), Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's serialized novel The Green Mile falls far short of the director's previous effort, The Shawshank Redemption.  Revolving around a series of unusual events taking place on death row of Louisiana's Cold Mountain prison in the mid 1930s, the film focuses on head guard Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), easily cinema's most humane and forgiving penitentiary employee -- who also happens to have a vicious urinary tract infection.  Unfortunately, the rest of the formidable cast lines up along one of two polar opposites: either big-hearted and destined for sainthood or malevolent and hateful.  This approach robs the characters of much-needed complexity, and infuses the proceedings with a rote predictability just an inch from the borderline of formula.  The Green Mile's significant running time (at least a half hour to an hour longer than needed) isn't justified by the subject matter, and the bizarre and unnecessary framing device undoubtedly works better on the page than on the screen."
"Hans237","7","0","2","13 December 1999"," Come on Frankie! What were you thinking?
","This movie was probably one of my biggest disappointments of the year. I went in expecting a great movie. I am a huge fan of The Shawshank Redemption. But, what I got instead was an ok movie. Sure, Tom Hanks was good as the good ol' every guy (what does that make this, four in a row?). And yes the supporting actors were good (reaffirms my admiration for David Morse and James Cromwell). Michael Duncan was good as the ""I'm huge, but I'm just a child"" man. But all in all the whole thing just did not seem to come together.<br/><br/>The ending for one thing felt like it was just tacked on because they had filmed it. And when it ended (or should I say FINALLY ended) it did just that. Just stopped no conclusion, no wrap-up, nothing!<br/><br/>
And I can't forget to mention the horrific scene of the execution . This scene was so over the top and gruesome that it totally through me out of the narrative and I don't think I ever really got back into it. King has shown that implied horror can be much worse than graphic horror. I know that many people will disagree, seeing as this is the the ""It's popular to like this movie!"" movie of the year. I really wish I could be writing a better review but I can't. I just hope Frank Darabont decides to explore a different area of the cinema, before stepping behind the camera next time."
